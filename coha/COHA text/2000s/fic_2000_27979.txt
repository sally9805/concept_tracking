CAIRO It was April and the khamsin was blowing , a howling desert wind that lashed the streets with gusts of blinding sand . As the taxi pulled up outside the morgue and I stepped out , I wondered again what had possessed me to come here on such a wicked night , and with no more evidence to go on than the corpse of an old man washed up on the banks of the Nile . Do you want me to wait , sir ? ' The taxi driver was a young man with a beard and a mouthful of bad teeth . Why not ? ' It definitely was n't the kind of night to go looking for another cab . The morgue was one of those grand , solid old stone buildings you often see in Egypt , a relic of its colonial past , but now it looked quite gloomy and the worse for wear , the granite blackened by years of pollution and neglect . I saw a filthy alleyway at the side , litter swirling in the driving wind . A porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in the middle . I went down the alleyway and rang the bell . I heard it buzz somewhere inside the building and after a few moments the grille opened and a man 's unshaven face appeared . Ismail ? ' The man nodded . I 've come to see the old man 's body , ' I said in Arabic . The one they fished out of the Nile . Captain Halim of the Cairo police told me to ask for you . ' He seemed surprised that I spoke his language , but then he opened the door with a rattle of bolts and moved aside to let me enter . I stepped in out of the bitter wind , shook sandfrom my coat , and went into the hallway . I felt a strange excitement fluttering in my chest . Here I was , a man in my middle fifties , feeling like an excited schoolkid , hoping that at last I might find answers to a bizarre mystery that had haunted me for so many years . It was surprisingly cool inside , and an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decaying flesh . I could see a wooden archway that led into the morgue itself , the area beyond poorly lit by a dim bulb and a couple of guttering , aromatic candles . Several metal tables were set around the room , grubby white sheets draped over the corpses that lay underneath , and built into the morgue 's granite walls were at least a dozen stainless steel vaults , their scratched surfaces pitted with dents . Ismail stared up at me , a well-practised look of grief on his face . He was small and overweight and wore a faded cotton djellaba . Are you a relative of the dead one ? ' I 'm a journalist . ' The expression of grief faded instantly . I do n't understand . ' He frowned . What do you want here ? ' I took out my wallet , generously peeled off several notes and handed them across . For your trouble . ' Pardon ? ' Your time . And I wo n't take up much of it . I 'd just like to see the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a story in it for me , you understand ? ' Ismail obviously did . The money banished any argument , and he smiled as he stuffed the notes into his pocket . Of course , as you wish . I 'm always happy to oblige the gentlemen of the press . You 're an American ? ' That 's right . ' I thought so . Come this way . ' He led me into the morgue . It was very cool inside , the flaking walls painted duck-egg blue and the delicate Arab filigree woodwork on the arches and doors an art in itself , but the place looked shabby and in need of renovation . Ismail gestured to what looked like a small work area , enclosed by a heavy beaded curtain . The body is over here . I was just working on it when you rang . Not a very pleasant experience when a corpse has been in water for several days . You still wish to see it ? ' That 's why I 'm here . ' I followed him over and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles were set beside a marble slab , a naked male corpse on top , and next to it was a small metal table with some of the simple tools of the mortician laid out . Waxed cord , cotton wool , some bowls of water . The paraphernalia of death did n't really change much no matter where you were , Cairo or Kansas . There were some clean clothes folded neatly beside the table , an old linen suit and a shirt and tie , socks and shoes , as if they were meant for laying out the corpse . The old man on the slab must have been well into his seventies and quite tall , at least six foot . His eyes were glassy and open in death , his thinned grey hair sleeked back off his forehead . The skin was white and shrivelled from being in the water , his features tight and horribly contorted . But there was no sign of a long scar in the middle of his chest , evidence that he had been sewn up after an autopsy . In Moslem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset if death occurs in the morning , otherwise the following day , and the dead are considered sacred and barely touched . Even murder victims are usually only treated to a necropsy : an external visual inspection of the remains to help determine the cause of death , which is educated guesswork at best . I felt a shiver go through me , for the scent of the candles did n't hide the stench of decomposition , and nodded at the corpse . What can you tell me about him ? ' The mortician shrugged , as if one more death in a chaotic city of fifteen million souls hardly mattered . He was brought here yesterday . The police found him in the water near the Nile railway bridge . The identification in his wallet said his name was Johann Halder , a German , and he had an address at a flat in the Imbaba district . ' That much I already knew . Did anyone claim the body ? ' Not yet . The corpse will be kept for a time while relatives are sought . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived alone . ' I take it he 's not of the Moslem faith ? ' A Christian , the police think . ' Did he drown ? ' Ismail nodded . The pathologist believes so . As you can see , there are no wounds on the body He thinks maybe the old man fell into the river by accident , as happens sometimes . Or perhaps he 's a suicide from one of the bridges . ' He rubbed his stubble . But it 's impossible to know for certain . ' Anything else you can tell me ? ' I 'm afraid not . You 'll have to ask the police . ' From what I hear , they discovered our dead friend had a second set of identity papers hidden at his flat . They were pretty old , and in the name of Hans Meyer . ' Ismail shrugged . I 'm just a simple mortician . I heard nothing about such matters . But I know we have many foreigners living in Cairo , including Germans . You 're from an American newspaper ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But not half as interesting as the old man could be . ' You knew him ? ' Ismail said , surprised . Let 's just say if he 's who I think he is , you could be looking at the earthly remains of a truly incredible man , considering he 's supposed to have been dead for over fifty years . ' Pardon ? ' A long story . But if it is him , then you 've got a very remarkable corpse keeping you company tonight . ' Ismail whistled . Then no wonder the other gentleman was so interested . ' Other gentleman ? ' He was here not half an hour ago . He came to inspect the body . An elderly American . Used to getting his way , like most Americans . He barged in here and demanded to see the remains . ' Ismail grinned and tapped the pocket of his djellaba . Alas , he was n't as generous as some of his countrymen . When I asked him for a little baksheesh he threatened to cut off my hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harry Weaver , I think he said . ' I was intrigued , felt a strange tingling down my spine . Harry Weaver ? You 're sure of the name ? ' I believe so . ' Describe him to me . ' Quite tall . In his late seventies , maybe even older , but he seemed to have kept himself in excellent condition . A very capable-looking fellow . ' Ismail looked surprised when he saw my startled reaction . You know this Mr Weaver ? ' Not personally , but I 've heard of him . ' He seemed like an important man . Used to giving orders . A military type . ' He was certainly that , ' I offered . And you can thank Allah you did n't lose your life , never mind your hand . Harry Weaver is definitely not the kind of man to solicit for bribes . He 's a model of authority . For almost forty years he was an adviser on American presidential security . ' Ismail spread his hands in a helpless gesture . But baksheesh is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . ' I pulled up the collar of my coat and made to go . Ismail said , Do you think the body belongs to the German you spoke of ? ' I looked down at the corpse . God only knows . The poor soul 's in such a state it 's hard to tell which end of him is up . Do you know where Mr Weaver went ? ' To the house where the German lived . I heard him talk to the taxi driver who waited for him outside . ' This gets more interesting by the minute . Do you know the address ? ' Of course . I went there yesterday to fetch some clothes for the burial , on the instructions of the police . ' Ismail wrote the address on a slip of paper I handed him . The rooms are on the top floor . ' Have the police sealed up the flat ? ' No . It was hardly necessary , the old man had n't got many belongings worth talking about . But if they bothered to lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I tucked the paper into my pocket , Ismail said , Will there be anything else ? ' I took one last look at the old man 's corpse before I turned to leave . No , thanks , you 've been more than helpful . ' * * * Imbaba is a working-class district , parts of it a crumbling shantytown of wooden and concrete dwelling houses near the banks of the Nile . The streets are puddled with open sewers , and the homes are huddled closely together as if to protect themselves from the poverty and squalor all around . The taxi driver found the address without any problem . The house was built in the Arab style , a big old dwelling , all ancient brown wood and very run-down , the windows covered in shabby , faded net curtains , and there was a rotting , carved wooden balcony jutting out from the first floor . There was n't another taxi outside but the front door was open , banging in the wind , a dark hallway beyond . Wait here , ' I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hallway stank of urine and stale food . As I went up the stairs , the wood creaked . I could hear a child crying and a couple arguing somewhere below in the darkness of the house . When I got to the landing I saw that one of the doors leading off was open and I stepped inside . The room I found myself in was typically Egyptian , but it was shabby and in complete disarray . Drawers were open and their contents spilled out , as if someone had searched the place . Old papers and correspondence , clothes and personal belongings , and a pair of shattered spectacles lay crushed on the floor . A couple of doors led to other rooms , and there was a window that looked out on to the Nile , covered in darkness . I looked through the correspondence and papers , but there was really nothing of interest . As I closed one of the drawers , I knocked over a table lamp . It fell to the floor with a clatter , and then suddenly one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , elderly man come into the room . The bedroom he 'd stepped out of was in disarray behind him , papers scattered everywhere , and he held a pair of reading glasses in his hand . He wore a pale trench coat , his silver hair was flecked with sand , and he had a slightly haunted look on his tanned face . I knew he was at least in his early eighties , but he was remarkably well preserved , had a freshness about him that made him appear ten years younger . And he still looked every inch the military typeover six feet , his features finely chiselled , though his shoulders were slightly stooped and his piercing grey eyes looked watery with age . They narrowed as he took me in . Who the hell are you ? ' he demanded , his accent unmistakably American . I could ask you the same question , if I did n't already know the answer , Colonel Weaver . ' He seemed taken aback . You know me ? ' Not personally , but what American has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime . Security adviser to American presidents for almost forty years . ' And who are you ? ' Weaver snorted . The name 's Frank Carney . ' He seemed unimpressed , but then something flickered in his eyes and he frowned . Not Carney the New York Times reporter ? ' I 'm afraid so . ' Weaver relaxed for a moment . I used to read your columns . Not that I agreed with everything you wrote , mind . ' You must have agreed with some of it , though , ' I offered . I was a cub reporter covering Dallas as a stand-in when Kennedy was killed . You were one of his security advisers . You told him not to go , remember ? ' Too many weak spots . Damned holes everywhere in the local security . And he was a sitting duck in that open-top ear , despite the assurances of the Secret Service that they could protect him . ' Had Jack Kennedy listened to you , he might still be alive today . I said as much when I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too late now . But come to think of it , I seem to remember your article . It was a fair and honest assessment of the facts . ' That 's because I did my homework . I read what I could about your background at the time . Trust no one and doubt every fact was your personal motto . With a career as long as yours , you seemed like a man worth taking advice from . ' Put it down to experience . The years harden you . ' Weaver looked across at me , suddenly suspicious again . None of which explains what the hell you 're doing here . This is private property . ' Again , I could ask you the same . Did the landlord let you in ? ' What the hell is it to you if he did ? Just answer the goddamned question . ' Oh , I think you can guess why . We were both at the morgue for the same reason . Johann Halder . Arguably one of the greatest enigmas of the Second World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Apparently I just missed you . And by the way , the attendant was n't very pleased you did n't leave a tip . ' Weaver 's eyes narrowed cautiously . How do you know about Johann Halder ? ' Egyptology happens to be an abiding interest of mine , which is why I 've spent the last five years in Cairo as a correspondent . Quite a few years back I was researching an article on one Franz Halder , a wealthy German collector of Egyptian artefacts . I had it in mind to write a book about some of the priceless Egyptian treasures that went missing from private collections and museums all over Europe during the last war , many of which have still never been found . ' Weaver registered interest . So ? ' Before the war , Halder owned one of the finest private collections in Germany , most of it irreplaceable , and he was a benefactor of the Egyptian Museum . He died when the Allies destroyed Hamburg during a massive fire-bombing raid in 1943 . Some time after that , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little deeper , to find out if they had any living relatives , anyone who might have known what became of the collection . So I had a journalist friend in Berlin do some checking for me . There were no relatives still alive , at least none that could tell me anything worthwhile , but it turned out Halder had a son , Johann , who served during the war . The German military records stated that he died in action in 1943 , on some kind of mission , but made no mention of how or where . Though my friend did discover that Halder had been recruited by the Abwehr in 1940 . That 's the wartime German intelligence agency to you and me . ' I know what the Abwehr was , Carney . But go on . ' As a boy , Johann Halder was educated in America , until his mother died tragically giving birth to her second child . After that , his father brought him back to Berlin , though apparently for many years they returned to the States each summer . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . I visited there some years back , but the place had changed hands many years ago , the house had been demolished , and no one in the area remembered the Halders . ' I 'm hardly surprised You 're talking about a long time ago . ' Johann Halder also spoke several languages fluently , including Arabic , and attained the rank of major during the war , though he never joined the Nazi Party . The rest of his military background is pretty much a mystery , apart from a stint spent in North Africa , and there were no details of the mission he 's supposed to have died on . ' And what else did you learn ? ' Weaver said quietly . This is where it starts to get really interesting . I thought no more about it until recently , when I interviewed one of the former heads of the Egyptian Museum , Kemal Assan , shortly before he died . I mentioned Franz Halder in passing and Assan said he met his son , Johann , in 1939 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , he said he 'd also seen him in Cairo after the war . Considering Halder was supposed to be dead , that fact seemed pretty incredible . ' Weaver was suddenly very interested . And what exactly did this Assan tell you ? ' Ten years ago , he was sitting in a Cairo coffee house minding his own business , when he noticed a man seated at the next table . Assan thought his face seemed oddly familiar . When he asked if he knew him , the man simply smiled and said in German , " We met long ago in another life . " Then he got up and left . Assan spoke some German , and he was adamant the man was Johann Halder . ' Weaver 's eyes sparked . Did n't he try to follow him ? ' He tried to , but he lost him in the bazaar . ' Weaver looked deflated . I see . So you believed Halder might be still alive ? ' It 's a mystery that 's bothered me ever since . I really did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But certainly I thought there might have been a story in it . If Halder was still alive , there was a chance he might know what had become of his father 's collection . Then I came across a mention in yesterday 's Egyptian Gazette , about the body of an elderly German recovered from the Nile . Apparently , his identity papers named him as Johann Halder , and the police were asking for anyone with information to come forward . When I heard the name I put two and two together , and hoped it might make four . ' I looked across at Weaver , who stood there , taking it all in , but he did n't say another word . The question is , what are you doing here , Colonel ? The last I heard you were living in Washington . But come to think of it , if I remember correctly , you 've had a lifelong interest in Egypt . You have several archaeological digs to your credit , and served here with military intelligence during the war . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you obviously knew about Halder . ' Weaver seemed suddenly at a loss for words , caught in a trap of his own making . He sighed , flopped into one of the chairs , but did n't utter a word . Was it Johann Halder back there in the morgue ? ' Weaver did n't reply . Then at least tell me why you 're here . And how you knew Halder . After all , it 's not every day I come across a story about a man who 's been reported dead , and yet might still be alive over fifty years later . ' Still Weaver did n't answer . I stared at him . I get the feeling I 'm talking to a brick wall , Colonel . ' He remained sitting there , motionless . At least tell me why you 're here . One simple question . Is that too much to ask ? ' Weaver seemed to lose his patience . God , Carney , you 're like a dog after a bone . I 've had enough of your goddamned questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said firmly , You 're a stranger to me . And I do n't discuss my personal business with strangers . ' OK , Colonel , if that 's what you wish . But I 'd like to tell you something . Maybe come at this from another angle . ' Weaver looked exasperated . Shut it , Carney . I 'm not in the mood . ' I think maybe you 'll want to hear what I have to say . ' I doubt it . ' Just hear me out for one minute . The moment I heard your name back in the morgue , I felt a shiver down my spine . I kind of like to think it might be kismet playing its partfate to you and me , the kind of thing the Egyptians are so fond of believing in . ' Weaver 's eyes narrowed . What the hell are you talking about ? ' The article I wrote about you after Dallas . You never asked how come I knew so much about your personal background , when there really was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nodded . I seem to vaguely recall all the facts were there , all right . But what of it ? ' Does the name Tom Carney mean anything to you ? ' Weaver looked totally astonished , as if I 'd dealt him a blow . Captain Tom Carney ? ' The same . He was my old man . You served in military intelligence together , and landed in North Africa during Operation Torch , 1943 . You were wounded by shrapnel after a mortar hit your reconnaissance unit outside Algiers . He carried you back to American lines , under heavy enemy fire . He got a medal for that one , on your recommendation . He was also wounded twice for his trouble , and got shipped home . ' The hardness peeled from Weaver 's face , all his aggression gone , and he studied me intently . Well , I 'll be damned . So you 're Tom Carney 's son . ' My old man talked a lot about you over the years . The feeling I got , you were once good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he were remembering . He was a good man . Courageous . Honest . One of the best I served with . I was only sorry we did n't keep in touch . Though I heard he died , what , maybe ten years back ? ' Twelve . And still not a day goes by when I do n't miss him . ' I looked at Weaver steadily . I like to believe that sometimes lives intersect , even briefly , for all sorts of reasons we mortals ca n't even begin to comprehend . Maybe it 's written in our stars . Like you and my old man . You know , it 's odd , but my father used to talk a lot about destiny . And maybe if he had n't been with you the time you were wounded , things might have turned out very differently , for both of you . Fate 's a funny thing , Colonel . And when I heard your name mentioned back at the morgue , I figured it might have been fate lending me a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halder business has been rattling around in my head for quite a few years , an enigma that wo n't go away , and I 'd like to get to the bottom of it . So if there 's any way you can help , I 'd be grateful . I 'm not trying to call in any family favours , Colonel , believe me . But I reckon my father was a man you could trust . I 'm simply asking you to trust me . ' Weaver was silent . Maybe you think I 'm asking too much ? Two simple questions . Why you 're here , and how you knew Halder . ' Weaver sighed , a long , hard sigh that sounded like he was trying to expel some kind of pain from deep inside him . Yes , I knew Johann Halder , ' he admitted finally . A very long time ago . ' Now you do surprise me . I know why I 'm here . But what about you ? What 's your reason ? ' Weaver sat forward in the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if my persistence had finally worn him down , and there was a tired , sad look on his face . Oh , there are lots of reasons , Carney . Lots of them , I assure you . ' He was about to say something else just then , but appeared to change his mind . So , you thought there might be a story in all this ? ' I was kind of hoping there might be . And even if not , I might at least be able to put my curiosity to rest . ' Weaver hesitated , as if trying to decide something , then he seemed to make up his mind . I think you could certainly say there 's a story , but I doubt it would help you discover what happened to Franz Halder 's collection . There 's a good chance it probably ended up in Russian hands after Berlin was stormed . Almost everything of value did . ' I figured that was a distinct possibility . But what about Johann Halder ? It seems to me he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can you tell me about him ? ' Weaver was uncomfortable , as if the pain he 'd tried to expel had returned . He looked around the room . Is there a drink in this place ? ' I guess not . ' Damn . ' Weaver stood and moved to the window . The wind was lashing the tall palm trees along the Nile . He did n't look back as he spoke , almost absent-mindedly . Cairo used to be quite a place during the war , did you know that ? You could even say the fate of the entire world was decided here . ' Really ? Care to tell me about it ? ' He did n't answer for a moment , lost in thought as he looked out through the window . I could give you a story , Carney . Maybe the strangest you 've ever heard . The real question is , would you believe it ? ' Try me . ' He turned back , and his face was deathly serious . On one condition . You do n't publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was surprised . You look like a man in remarkably good health , Colonel . That could be a long wait . ' Maybe not so long . I 'm an old man , Carney , I ca n't have much time left . And I kind of guess at that stage the truth of it would n't hurt anyone , not with so many years passed . But you know the oddest thing ? I 've never told my story to a soul . I could have done , wanted to , many times , because it haunted me , but I kept it to myself for over fifty years . And maybe the time 's come to unburden it to someone , before it 's too damned late . ' He stared at me . You could be right about fate , Carney . Destiny playing its part . Besides , having read your work , and if you 're anything like your father , I believe you might be an honest man , one who 'll abide by my wishes . ' I met his stare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the filthy room , as if suddenly uneasy in his surroundings . You mind if we get out of here ? ' I 've a taxi waiting outside . I can give you a lift . ' On an evening like this , I wo n't say no . By the way , I 'm staying at the new Shepheard 's . It 's nothing quite like the old hotel it replaced , but at least it serves pretty decent American Scotch . ' Now you 're talking . ' Weaver pulled up the collar of his trench coat , stepped out on to the landing , and went quickly down the stairs . I took one last look around the shabby flat , closed the door , and followed him . The drive to Shepheard 's was something of a trial . For some reason , Weaver hardly spoke , just stared out of the cab window , lost in a world of his own . I had a terrible feeling he might have been reconsidering his offer to tell me his story , but when we reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as we entered the lobby , I 'll meet you in the bar in ten minutes . Mine 's a very large Dewars . Straight . ' He stepped into the elevator and I went into the restaurant bar . The old Shepheard 's Hotel had what the guidebooks like to call atmosphere . It had a certain faded glory that suggested belle poque , all dark wood and soaring marble columns , rich carpets and antique furniture . It used to be one of the old grand hotels , built to accommodate wealthy Europeans . The modern Shepheard 's is a pale imitation by comparison , though it still attracts the tourists . But there were none in the bar that night , just a couple of foreign businessmen chatting over drinks . I took a seat near a window and ordered two large Dewars , then changed my mind and told the waiter to bring the bottle . Weaver came down ten minutes later . He had changed into a sweater and cotton pants and he seemed more at ease as he looked around the bar . Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Does Shepheard 's bring back memories , Colonel ? ' Far too many , I 'm afraid , ' Weaver replied almost wistfully . And enough of this Colonel business . I 've been retired for over twenty years . ' He studied the room . Did you know that Greta Garbo used to stay at the original hotel ? Not to mention Lawrence of Arabia , Winston Churchill , and half the Gestapo spies in wartime Cairo . ' I refilled our glasses and set the bottle between us . I read somewhere once that Rommel telephoned the front desk to make a reservation after the fall of Tobruk , believing he 'd be in Cairo within a week . If memory serves me , the old Shepheard 's was burned down during the riots for independence in 52 . Apparently , most Egyptians saw it as an irritating symbol of British imperialism . ' It seems you know your history , Carney . ' Which is why something bothers me . If everything I 've learned about Johann Halder is true , and if he was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disappear into hiding and remain such a mystery ? ' I believe there could have been several reasons . One of them being the fact that the United States had good enough evidence to condemn him as a traitor . Probably could even have hanged him . ' I frowned . Whatever for ? Halder was a German citizen , surely . How could he have been a traitor ? ' He was certainly a German citizen , but he was American-born . His real name was Johann , though he was better known as Jack . And his disappearance had to do with the mission you spoke about , the one he was supposed to have died on . Probably the most daring the Nazis ever came up with . And it happened right here in Egypt . ' I do n't understand . ' Halder led a covert team to assassinate President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Cairo , on Adolf Hitler 's direct orders . ' I was stunned . Now you really do surprise me . An American-born assassin sent by Hitler to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down his Scotch . And probably the best American President that ever lived , come to that . Halder 's mission was meant to change the tide of the war for the Nazis . And there was much more at stake than when Kennedy was targeted in Dallas . The future of the entire free world , no less . And it happened while Roosevelt and Churchill were attending the Cairo Conference in November 1943 , one of the most vital Allied conferences of the war . Among other things , the President and Prime Minister were in Cairo to agree top-secret plans for Operation Overlord , the invasion of Europe . Had Hitler got his way , and had them assassinated , the Allies would have been thrown into chaos , the invasion would never have gone ahead , and Germany would have won the war . ' Weaver put up his thumb and forefinger , held them the barest fraction apart . Believe me , Carney , it came this close to succeeding . It still frightens me to think about it . ' I was overwhelmed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . ' Weaver said firmly , Oh , it happened all right , do n't you doubt it . And it was my job to stop Halder and kill him . But it was n't something that ever got a mention in the history books , it was far too sensitive a matter for that . ' I looked at him eagerly . But I do n't understand . Even assuming Halder survived , why would you still want to find him after all these years ? So he could be branded a traitor ? It 's pretty late for that , surely ? ' There was a rather sad look in his eyes . He glanced out towards the Nile , before looking back . No , the reasons are far more private , ' he said quietly . And then I was aware of a sudden powerful emotion in his voice . But make no mistake about one thing , Carney . Halder really did help to change the course of world history . ' You mind telling me how ? ' Weaver must have noticed the confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he looked out beyond the window and his eyes glazed over , as if he were trying to see into the past . The howling sandstorm had almost died away , lifting the veil off the ancient city , and suddenly you could see the majestic Nile , the house boats out on the river , the pungent dark alleyways and soaring minarets , the ghostly outline of the Giza pyramids in the far distance . I could easily imagine how it must have been over fifty years ago , a city full of mystery and intrigue . When Weaver turned back there was a look on his face that was hard to fathom . Grief perhaps , or painI could n't tell which . Maybe I had better start at the beginning . You see , I knew Jack Halder long before the war . We were childhood friends . You might even say we were like brothers . '
