If you 're going to have an economic crisis , do the rest of the world a favor : signal your intentions well in advance . That 's one lesson ( there are others ) from the default by Argentina on $132 billion of debt . So far , the markets have hardly blinked , and the reason is plain : this train wreck has been coming for two years , giving those foreign banks holding Argentine paper plenty of time to hedge their bets or make provisions against losses . The default , says Nariman Behravesh , chief global economist at DRI-WEFA , an economic consultancy in Massachusetts , was so well anticipated that " foreign investors who wanted to get out got out . " And unlike 1997-98 , when financial crises rolled around the world , this year shows no sign yet of " contagion . " Neither Brazil nor Mexico , the two largest Latin American economies , seems to have been affected by Argentina 's woes . <P> None of this means that others can simply shrug their shoulders . The Bush Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duhalde , says a senior State Department official , is " We 'll have to wait and see . " But Argentina bears close attention . For one thing , its very governability is at stake . Before Christmas , riots provoked by cuts in social spending and limits on bank withdrawals brought down the government of President Fernando de la Rua and left 28 dead . Argentina then engaged in the politics of a comic opera , with three men holding the title of head of state in less than two weeks , before Duhalde was sworn in . <P> Duhalde 's economic plan will bring more pain to Argentina 's middle class . By breaking the 10-year-old link between the peso and the dollar and allowing a devaluation of the local currency , the new government hopes to improve the competitiveness of Argentine exports . But that will mean rising prices at home and substantial bankruptcies , among both households and businesses . ( Most Argentine debts are denominated in dollars and will now have to be repaid with less-valuable pesos . ) If rising prices and bankruptcies lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Latin America was known less for the democratic transfer of power than for autocrats with epaulets on their shoulders . So far , nobody has suggested that Argentina 's crisis might be solved by a smack of military discipline . But more disorder could change that judgment . <P> Then there 's the risk of what Caroline Atkinson , a former senior U.S. Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations , calls " policy contagion . " Duhalde has been critical of the free-trade , free-market policies that , under the tutelage of the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund , Argentina has adopted in the past decade . Last week Duhalde committed his government to " the unrestricted defense of national interests . " Said the President : " No one wants a return to the old protectionism , but we need to protect our own . " Right now Argentina looks like a great , unenviable mess , but if Duhalde really does adopt populist , nationalist policies , he may have imitators  --  especially in Brazil , which holds a presidential election later this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henrique Cardoso have many opponents .
