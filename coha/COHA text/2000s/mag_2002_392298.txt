// Children 's Health Nighttime Fears Q. My 3-year-old is afraid of the dark ; he 's convinced he sees the bogeyman . What should I do ? A. It 's not surprising that nighttime can be frightening for little kids . They 're alone in the dark , and since they often ca n't separate fantasy from reality , they may believe the shadows on the walls are monsters . To make bedtime less scary for your child : Do n't dismiss his fears by saying " You should n't be afraid " or " Big boys do n't get scared . " You 'll only embarrass him and discourage him from confiding in you . Resist the temptation to tell him you 'll frighten away the bogeyman . This suggests that the demon is real , which may make him more afraid . Ask him to draw what he sees at night , a method that worked when my daughter was 4 . Doing this is therapeutic for a child , similar to writing in a journal ; it helps him express his worries . Plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or CD as your child drifts off to sleep . You might let the music play softly and continuously throughout the night so that any time he wakes up he 'll hear a familiar sound . If a nightlight keeps him awake , give him a flashlight to put next to his bed . That way , he can shed some of his own light on suspicious shadows . Having this formidable power may be enough to quell his fears . The Facts About Jaundice Q. Our newborn was diagnosed with jaundice . What can I expect ? A.Most newborns develop some degree of jaundice , a yellowish tinge to the skin and whites of the eyes . In nearly all cases , it 's harmless if appropriately diagnosed and treated . The most common kind-physiologic ( low-risk ) - appears by the third or fourth day and subsides within a week or two . It occurs when a newborn 's immature liver ca n't process all of the bilirubin , the pigment formed when red blood cells break down . Though the condition typically disappears as the liver matures , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in enough breast milk early on to produce enough stool to flush out the bilirubin . A less common type-pathologic ( high-risk ) - results when too much bilirubin is generated ; untreated , it can lead to brain damage on rare occasions . The condition usually occurs when a mother and a child have different blood types and the mother 's body produces antibodies that break down the fetus 's blood cells , triggering a sudden release of bilirubin . Pathologic jaundice typically shows up within a day or two of birth . Parents should notify their doctor immediately if they notice symptoms . In high-risk cases , a test can determine a child 's bilirubin level . It need n't be a painful heel stick anymore : A flashlight-like device now measures the bilirubin level in seconds . If the level is high , your infant may be monitored over the next few days or weeks . Or your doctor may place him under a phototherapy lamp or blanket-at home or in the hospital-to speed up the breakdown of bilirubin . When It 's Painful to Pee Q. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections ( UTIs ) . What can I do to prevent my daughter from getting one ? A. Infections of the urinary tract-including bladder and kidney infections-are much more common among girls than boys . The reason is anatomy : The female urethra-the tube that carries urine from the bladder-is shorter , making it easier for bacteria to enter these organs and cause an infection . But you can decrease the chance of your daughter 's developing a UTI if you follow these simple guidelines : Teach her to empty her bladder completely and frequently , which will wash out any bacteria present in the urethra before they 're able to latch on . A method that worked with my own daughter was to teach her to double void-after your child urinates , she should count to ten and try again . Have her drink plenty of water ( two to four 8-ounce glasses per day for a 30-pound child ) , which helps flush out germs before they have a chance to multiply . Also , a daily glass of cranberry juice can help ; it contains substances that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urethra and the bladder . Make sure she wipes herself from front to back to keep any germs from bowel movements from entering the urethra . With babies and toddlers still in diapers , be careful to wipe stool away from the vaginal area . Limit bubble baths or prolonged soaks in soapy water to no more than once a week . The perfumes and dyes in bath products can wash away the urethra 's protective mucus layer , allowing bacteria easier access . If you suspect your daughter has a UTI ( the usual symptoms are frequent , burning , or painful urination , often paired with a fever , abdominal pain , or a backache ) , take her to the doctor . He 'll order a urinalysis to determine whether she has a UTI . He may also order a urine culture , to figure out which antibiotic to prescribe . If your child does have an infection , it should begin to clear up within 48 hours and disappear within seven days of starting treatment . Recurrent UT 's often warrant examination by a specialist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child that can cause urinary reflux . In rare cases , reflux-along with the frequent infections themselves-can lead to kidney damage if left undetected and thus untreated .
