The Pivnicks saved $140 a month by changing cellphone plans . The Porters reduced driving mileage by 35% when they started doing errands in one trip . The Joneses bought organic food more cheaply . <p> In the past several months , USA TODAY and ABC 's Good Morning America Weekend challenged families to save more , cut back on food costs , reduce gas spending , and simplify their holiday gift-buying . The Frugal Family Challenge paired seven families with industry experts to help them save . <p> But those were one-month challenges . How have the families done in a longer period of time , and what can consumers learn from their experiences ? <p> Using a budget <p> In early December , the Walker and Pivnick families set budgets and held to them . Three months later , they report success . <p> " We have n't really had any major slip-ups , " Jimmie Walker says . <p> Before the challenge , the Walkers , of New Haven , Mich. , ate out several times a week , spent aggressively , and often put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financial planner in Southfield , Mich. , helped the Walkers differentiate between wants and needs . <p> The Walkers set a tight budget , reduced their satellite TV package , got rid of Jimmie 's expensive iPhone and stopped eating out . <p> Today , they estimate their monthly savings at $500 and are working on eliminating their $25,000 credit card debt . They 've already paid off about $4,000 , a feat Wyman describes as " very impressive . " <p> " Whether you live in Michigan or anywhere else , this is a big achievement at this time , " Wyman says . <p> What the Walkers have learned : <p> *Saving is a team effort . Use your significant other for support . " We both want things . I want an iPhone ; she wants new flooring . But we keep each other on track , " Jimmie says . <p> *Eat in . Giving up meals out of the house was tough , but once they did , they started saving and became closer as a family . " Going to the grocery store and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> *Celebrate each month . " It feels good looking over the month and realizing how much you saved , " Mitzi says . <p> The Pivnicks of Richardson , Texas , switched their homeowners insurance carrier for a cheaper one without sacrificing coverage . They started a 401(k) , to which they contribute 3% monthly , and they opened a medical flexible-spending account . Bruce cuts the lawn himself , saving the family $185 a month . And a more appropriate phone plan saves them $140 a month . <p> Some other tips : <p> *Switch to a budgeted bill-payment plan . Their energy bill is averaged , so there are no unexpected high-bill months . <p> *Start a flexible-spending account . Most large employers offer medical accounts that save pretax income . The Pivnicks will save hundreds of dollars annually with this change alone . <p> *Sign up for a personal finance seminar . <p> Saving on food costs <p> For the challenge , the Joneses were matched with Maile Carpenter of Food Network Magazine , who helped them spend less on groceries . <p> The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating organic . They prefer to shop at a store such as Whole Foods , where products fit their diet . During the challenge , however , the Joneses gave up higher-price food and learned to shop organic at a less-expensive store . <p> But completely giving up on the high-end supermarket was too difficult . " We made a compromise by going to the organic store half the time , " says Susan . Here are the Joneses suggestions for eating organic while saving money : <p> *If it has a peal it does n't need a seal . During the challenge , Carpenter explained that unless you plan on eating the skin , whatever you 're buying does n't need to be organically grown to be healthy , so the extra cost is not worth it . <p> *If you ca n't give up the high-end supermarket , commit to going half of the time . <p> *Invest in a slow cooker . Susan uses the slow cooker " pretty much every weekend , " she says . The meals last , and they 're healthier and cheaper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodeses and Porters were successful during their trial month , but only the Porters have been able to continue the savings . <p> Both families teamed with Philip Reed , consumer advice editor for automotive website Edmunds.com . <p> For the Rhodes family of Camas , Wash. , Reed recommended the family carpool more , use their inefficient cars less and use public transportation more . He also suggested laying off the gas pedal , and driving more slowly up a steep hill leading to their house . <p> But after the challenge ended , the family slid back into old habits . " Because we have five adults , when they fill up , they do n't often keep track of how much they spend , " Mary says . <p> Despite the difficulty , the family gained insight about how to save at the pump : <p> *Pay cash for gas . Putting an agreed-upon amount of cash into the glove box helps keep multiple drivers on a budget . <p> *Check tire pressure and air filters . An underinflated tire or clogged air filter will decrease a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27% of cars on U.S. roads have one or more underinflated tires . <p> *Select routes in advance . " I plan my routes so I am not going out in the heaviest traffic , " Mary says . The forward planning helps avoid getting lost and can discourage rushing . <p> The Porters have had better luck keeping their gas habits in check . Kelly still drives slower , avoiding what Reed called " midlevel acceleration " or when a driver increases speed to change lanes . She now moves when traffic allows her . The couple continue to carpool . <p> The only tip the Porters of Salem , Mass. , have not been able to continue carrying out is the walking . " With temperatures in the teens , it 's been difficult to keep that up , " Kelly says . But she says Tim still walks to his second job as a driving instructor , which is nearby . She says she plans to drive less when the weather turns . <p> Here are the Porters other suggestions : <p> *Avoid the drive-through window . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically shut the car off , " Kelly says . <p> *Keep the speed in check . " I used to drive 80 on the highway , and now I never go over 70 , " Kelly says . She says her new driving method not only saves gas , it 's also safer . <p> *When running errands , go to the farthest distance first and work backward . Reed says warmer cars are more efficient and save on gas . <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
