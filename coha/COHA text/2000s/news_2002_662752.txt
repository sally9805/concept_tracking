<p> CORPUS CHRISTI , Texas - Vast islands of glistening sargassum that clog our surf , hang on fishing lines and otherwise disappoint beach visitors represent a comeback for this light brown seaweed spawned from the heart of the Bermuda Triangle . <p> Actually , sargassum - a name derived from a Portuguese word for little grapes , referring to tiny spheres that provide buoyancy to this form of brown algae - comes from the Sea of Sargasso in the North Atlantic . <p> The Sargasso Sea is a 2-million-square-mile oval of calm , clear , blue warmth , with parameters defined by strong clockwise currents , which buffer its waters from their colder , deeper tempestuous surroundings . The much-studied Sargasso Sea can change position and shape with the seasons , weather patterns and currents . But regularity better describes this mysterious island of brine , which is less than one-third as fertile as coastal seawater . <p> As a matter of record , crops of sargassum have marked the Sea of Sargasso as far back as the late 15th Century , when Christopher Columbus mistakenly believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were near land . It is widely accepted that the Nina , Pinta and Santa Maria were far from land , aimlessly drifting in the Sea of Sargasso . <p> With such strong currents swirling around relative calm , you might think it difficult for the Sargasso Sea to release mass quantities of seaweed that is scattered to faraway shores . But annually , it does . And much of the seaweed is caught in the warm Gulf Stream and carried by loop currents around Florida , eventually collecting on the fishing lines of Corpus Christi surf anglers just when shark fishing gets good . <p> Surf-fishing guide Billy Sandifer tells me the weed is already beginning to hamper his efforts south of the 20-mile marker on Padre Island National Seashore . Sandifer holds that the amount of sargassum that reaches his view depends mostly on weather , water temperature and current . <p> And he 's right . <p> But there is more to it . <p> Brian LaPointe , an algal physiologist at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution in Fort Pierce , Fla. , believes that many forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters . <p> " Because of these nutrients ( in the form of fertilizer and sewage ) , it is safe to speculate that we can expect to see more and more events of large sargassum strandings , with excessive biomass . " <p> LaPointe believes that the increase in frequency of algal blooms , including red tide and sargassum , are linked to higher concentrations of nutrients from man . As our population grows , so will the amount of sargassum and the number of algal blooms . Historically , the Texas coast has gotten about one red tide bloom every 20-years or so from 1935 until about 1986 . But in the past six years , we 've had four significant blooms , according to Tracy Villareal , algea specialist at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas . <p> LaPointe said that in the case of sargassum , its growth rate can double once the seaweed drifts into nutrient-rich green coastal waters , compared with the much slower growth rate of sargassum that is afloat in nutrient-poor blue water . <p> It 's probably not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sargassum for the past two years has enjoyed a resurgence , much to the dismay of local anglers , beachgoers and those who promote tourism in coastal communities along the lower east coast and on the Gulf of Mexico . <p> Little study has been devoted to why sargassum abundance fluctuates dramatically . Even before this recent revival - believed by some to be simply part of the life cycle of the weed - I had grown accustom to the fact that as temperatures rise each year so do complaints about the seemingly endless flow of golden seaweed . <p> To be sure , the spongy mats can be a nuisance to man . <p> But as is the case with many natural annoyances , sargassum also is a blessing . So much so that someday we may hear cries of " Save the Sargassum " above the complaints . <p> Assemblyman Robert Smith ( D-Gloucester ) , who sponsored a bill aimed at protecting sargassum from commercial exploitation , began such a movement in the New Jersey Legislature . Smith 's bill , which would prohibit the importation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Recreational Fishing Alliance . <p> They do n't get much sargassum on New Jersey beaches , Smith said . But it does float in federal waters off the New Jersey coast . It should n't surprise you that Smith is an avid offshore angler , who considers sargassum a cradle of marine life in the Atlantic . <p> It did n't hurt his cause that the National Marine Fisheries Service has deemed sargassum essential fish habitat as part of its dolphin/wahoo management plan . It 's common for deep-sea anglers to catch dolphin fish near a sargassum raft . Dolphin probably feed on numerous baitfishes that use the natural flotsam for refuge and forage . <p> Interesting to note that excrement from the many sargassum-dependent fish and other organisms help fertilize the seaweed . <p> I did n't even know the exploitation of sargassum was an issue . As long as I 'm confessing ignorance , I might as well tell you there was a time when I openly wished someone would discover a commercial use for what appears to be an abundant renewable resource . I 've hoped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bays . <p> Before you condemn me , I 've never condoned the eradication of sargassum . I wanted plenty of it left to help prevent beach erosion the way nature intended . I just did n't see any harm in carting off what remained to a processing plant . <p> Careful what you wish for . As recently as 1997 , a company was harvesting tons of the seaweed off the North Carolina coast to produce chicken and livestock feed and fertilize . Currently , there is limited commercial harvesting of sargassum in the United States . But no harvest restrictions exist either . <p> Fisheries management councils from the South Atlantic , Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico are looking to close that door . <p> If left alone , sargassum is exploited by more than 140 species of marine invertebrates and vertebrates as food , shelter and spawning areas . Many of these species , such as sea turtles , are considered endangered or threatened . Some other species that depend on sargassum , such as tunas and marlin , are listed as overfished . <p> Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its entire life no where else but within the safety of sargassum rafts ? <p> And not only does sargassum provide a foundation for beach and dune stabilization , the weed that stinks up our beaches each summer supplies base nutrients for coastal habitats as well . And birds love it . <p> As you might have guessed , there is another side to this . <p> Turns out the weed is a potential cure for cancer and other diseases . I learned from a recent Discover Magazine article that the National Cancer Institute has found that many varieties of seaweed show promise in their ability to stimulate the immune system . Experiments with feed supplements made from sargassum have improved the immune responses in farm-raised hogs . <p> It also could be useful in sunscreens , as protection against the sun 's UV-A rays , believed to increase the risk of melanoma ( skin cancer ) . <p> Jack McClintock , in his Discover Magazine article , writes that sargassum also may be useful in processing industrial waste . Apparently , dead sargassum can absorb large quantities of otherwise toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chromium , zinc and uranium . <p> " When the seaweed is saturated with these metals , ( it ) can be washed with a mild acid and reused up to 80 times , " McClintock wrote . <p> Does anyone else see the irony here ? <p> Excessive nutrient runoff from overpopulation could explode the growth rate of sargassum to a point beyond nuisance . Buried in rotting seaweed , we discover that we can sop up our toxic messes with this newfound renewable resource . <p> All we need now is for someone to discover or invent a method to dispose of megatons of spent acid-drenched seaweed . <p> Just keep it off my fishing line . <p> Distributed By The Associated Press
