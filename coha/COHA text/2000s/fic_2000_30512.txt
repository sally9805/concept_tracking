Chapter One : Betheltown Bethel , Utah . April 2 , 1989 As the desert blurred past in the luminous hues impressionist 's palette , Faye huddled tightly against the car door , her eyes closed and her coffee hair spilling over her face . The last of the music , frayed tones from a hayseed country station , had miles back degenerated into a storm of static , and now the only noises were the car 's undulations over the primitive road and the occasional sigh of my sleeping companion . We had already traveled fifty miles past the last evidence of humanity , a rancher 's lodgepole-pine fence , into the desert 's blanched , stubbled plain , and Faye had not yet asked where it was that I was taking her . Her faith in our journey was not unlike her faith in our courtship , attributable only to some godlike quality of the female mystique  --  an unwavering virtue of hope and patience  --  that , if unable to predict our destination , found merit at least in the journey . I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months previously , I had n't even known of its existence  --  but the stories I had heard of the dead town had given it meaning , and I confess anxiety at its approach . I was told that the town , steeped in the foothills of the Oquirrh range , was constantly assailed by mountain winds . But there was no wind that day , and the spray of red dust in the car 's wake hung in the placid air , liberated from a roadway not trespassed for a year 's time . I was glad for this day , for its blanched , cloudless skies , for though I embraced the land 's immense solitude  --  felt akin to it  --  it would be foolhardy to venture so far from civilization with the possibility of becoming stranded on washed-out roads . Flash floods were common in these regions , and most of the ghost town 's abandoned mines had decades earlier collapsed under their turbulent runoff . The wash of such cataclysm was a souvenir hunter 's ecstasy of relics and coins and an occasional grain of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men came to take from the land or to take from those who had come to take from it , and even in death it was so . Only , today , I had not come to take but to impart . Before us the coarse road crested , then dipped into a barren creek bed surrounded by the pink clusters of spring beauties and the scattered stalks of bulrush that proved the creek still possessed occasional life . At the creek 's shallow bank I left the car idling and walked to the rill and placed a hand to its stony bed . There was no trace of moisture . I examined our intended route , rolled back a single stone of possible hazard , then returned to the car and traversed the bed . A half mile forward , the timber skeleton of a gold mine 's stamp mill rose from a mesquite-covered knoll  --  a wood-tarred contrivance of rusted wheels and cogs and corroded steel tracks over which ore cars had once rolled and men and horses had sweat . I glanced down to a crudely drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dying memory , Esther had remembered such landmarks so distinctly . I wondered if she had just never left . At the mill 's passing I turned west and coaxed my Datsun up the hill , where the road vanished into a buckwheat-dotted plain that spread infinitely to the north and south and climbed the foothills of the mountain into the town itself . As we neared the decrepit structures of the once-flourishing township , Faye 's eyes opened and she slid up in her seat . " Where are we ? " " Esther 's hometown . " Faye gazed on in apparent fascination . " ... what 's left of it . " We passed the ornamental iron fence of a cemetery " Welcome to Bethel  --  the House of God . " " This is where Esther was born ? " " She came here as a young woman . " I looked out at the desolate terrain . " Makes you wonder why anyone would come here . " Faye turned to me . " Why are we here ? " " To fulfill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentarily content with my ambiguity . I parked the car under the gnarled limbs of a black locust tree near the center of the deceased town and shut off the engine . The morning 's drive had taken nearly two hours , but it was the conclusion of a much greater journey , one that had taken nearly half a year . A journey that began the day my mother died .
