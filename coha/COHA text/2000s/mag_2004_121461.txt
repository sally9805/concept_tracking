Eric benson is an IT administrator who , on Tuesday nights , tugs on his New York Islanders jersey -- or , when the mood strikes , his rangers suck T-shirt -- and visits the Champions Sports Bar in the Long Island Marriott . There someone will pop in a videotape of an old Islanders game , and with two dozen other lost souls Benson will cheer on the **26;206;TOOLONG heroes on the screen . The good news is the Islanders of his boyhood always win these games . The bad news -- other than that a 26-year-old still thinks a rangers suck T-shirt is haute couture -- is that the arena across from Champions , the Nassau Coliseum , home of your New York Islanders , is dark . // If you are like Benson , your calendar 's four seasons are summer , fall , hockey and playoffs . You believe . You know those TV numbers that put the NHL somewhere between celebrity ski racing and rugby are big , bald lies because no Nielsen box can measure the depth of passion for your sport . // Maybe you were faking it until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college football or Peyton Manning , and you pretended it barely mattered -- a pox on both their houses , did n't you say that ?  - -  but now you zip your fleece up and thrust your hands into your pockets , and you know in your bones how much you miss hockey . You felt a flicker of optimism last week when the players ' association proposed a 24% salary rollback , a two-by-four to the head of a surprised Gary Bettman ( the NHL commissioner was to make a counteroffer on Tuesday ) , but you know that serious lockout negotiations are barely at the embryonic stage . No matter what happens this week , your Christmas will be unlike the others , a Christmas without hockey , at least of the NHL variety . // The season and the sport are inextricably linked , an organic blending of meteorological condition and memory . Veteran defenseman Chris Therien , now with the Dallas Stars , remembers Christmas morning as the official opening of the rink that his father built every year in their Ottawa backyard . " I looked forward to taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the NHL , with the Flyers , we 'd always take a long road trip to Western Canada that week . I loved the atmosphere . I felt the same way I did as a kid . " In Buffalo the Sabres ' traditional day-after-Christmas match always seemed like the most vibrant of the season . " People leave Buffalo for opportunities down south , " says Gregg Huller , who did n't miss one of those games for the past six years , " but this is a city people come back to for the holidays . That game after Christmas was special . " // There are almost 300 NHL players now moonlighting in Europe , but not every displaced hockey person can find work . On Nov. 30 Huller was fired from his $40,000-a-year job in media relations for the Sabres , one of 25 team employees let go that day . Huller , whose wife , Beth , is pregnant with their first child , now lives off his severance , polishes his r ? sum ? and applies for p.r . jobs . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner , John Rigas , being led away in handcuffs , a yearlong holdout by former captain Michael Peca and the vagaries of goaltender Dominik Hasek 's groin . He has lots of experience in crisis management. ) // This is the human trickle-down of a $2 billion industry that shut its doors in September and has shown little inclination to reopen them anytime soon . ( The season will most likely be scrapped unless an agreement is reached by mid-January . ) For Hockey Night in Canada analyst Harry Neale , the lockout means the highlight of the day is when his USA Today bangs against the front door . " Someone asked me and neighbor Don Lever , a St. Louis Blues assistant coach what we were doing , " Neale says . The answer : Not much . " When there was hockey , there were at least three or four days a week we could n't have a beer before 11 a.m . " For 16-year-old S ? bastien Grenier it means losing a $9-per-hour job , plus tips , and a chance to flirt with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wallet and the social life . For Detroit Red Wings coach Dave Lewis it means he could to fly to Moscow last weekend to see the venerable Igor Larionov play his farewell game . // " I was back in Saskatchewan recently when my mother died , " Lewis says . " I talked to people who told me , Saturday nights , seven o'clock , no game on TV -- they hardly know what to do with themselves . " // Lewis has the luxury of tending to his other line of work . Last spring he and Wings assistant Joe Kocur opened Joe &amp; Lewie 's Penalty Box in Fenton , Mich. , an hour northwest of Joe Louis Arena . The roadhouse hopped during the playoffs . Now with only the lesser charms of football to fill 25 TV screens , you can almost always get a table . This Christmas there is room at Lewie 's inn . // ?
