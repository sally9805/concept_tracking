Section : Technology Chemistry Superstrong adhesive goo is turning up in the unlikeliest places  --  concrete tunnels , cargo ships , operating rooms and pickup truck beds <p> When cyclist Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France in July , he had a distant cousin of Elmer 's Glue to thank . Armstrong had demanded an ultralight bike frame weighing less than 3 pounds , made of carbon fiber and twice as strong as a welded aluminum frame . But the sleek frame could n't be assembled by welding parts together  --  carbon does n't melt when heated , it just chars . <p> So bikemaker Trek turned to glue . It used an epoxy adhesive made by Loctite , a division of Germany 's Henkel Group , the world 's largest adhesives manufacturer . <p> Glue may not be a disruptive technology in itself , but its impact on industry is on the rise as manufacturers seek more design flexibility while cutting production costs . The sticky stuff turns out to be the ideal bond for materials with clashing chemical blueprints , such as steel and composite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rivets , bolts and welds . In many cases the new glues are so strong that the parts being joined will fail before the glues will . <p> A crop of firms is developing super-glues that run the gamut of engineering applications : assembling truck parts and concrete tunnels , shielding microprocessors from rogue electromagnetic signals and even sealing wounds without sutures . The players are fittingly tight-lipped  --  Loctite , H.B. Fuller and Illinois Tool Works would n't give specifics about their recipes ; 3M and Cytec wo n't talk about glues at all . <p> The adhesives market has annual U.S. sales of $10 billion . Sales of engineering glues , which account for $2.5 billion of that total , will grow 6.5% a year through 2005 , estimates ChemQuest Group , a Cincinnati-based adhesives consultant . That is nearly twice as fast as the overall market 's growth  --  and impressive for a particularly mature industry . Glue dates back 3,300 years , when Egyptians were making it from animal bones . <p> Now the challenge is to tweak old formulas to handle tougher tasks , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens-Midtown tunnel . The roof , completed in May , is made up of 930 concrete slabs , each 20 feet long and weighing 8 tons ; it was at first intended to be suspended from steel brackets secured by giant steel anchors jammed deep into the tunnel 's concrete shell . But the anchors could creep out of their holes because of vibration from traffic . Instead , the brackets were mounted to steel rods , which were then glued into the shell to become one with the concrete . <p> Ramset/Red Head , a unit of Illinois Tool Works , supplied the adhesive  --  a $28-per-pound formula it developed ten years ago for car bumpers . Ramset tweaked it for two years to handle concrete anchoring , in part by adding quartz for strength . Savings on the project were significant but undisclosed . " Let 's say it takes a lot longer to bang in those anchors than to glue in the rods , " says Ramset 's Richard Griffith . <p> Automakers have long relied on glue to keep windshields and dashboard trim in place , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heavy-duty plastic  --  a car now has 360 pounds of plastic , up sixfold in 30 years . Last year , in a major test , General Motors began gluing  --  rather than bolting  --  a whole molded plastic pickup box onto the frame of its 2001 Chevy Silverado truck . The glue , 1.1 gallons per truck , spreads force over a larger area , reducing rips that occur when stresses concentrate at the bolt shafts . Unlike bolts , glued joints do n't corrode . Using plastic shaved off 50 pounds and increased durability . <p> GM 's supplier , SIA Adhesives , a unit of privately held Sovereign Specialty Chemicals in Akron , Ohio , spent six years tweaking its formula , but such structural adhesives garner 25% higher gross margins than commodity glues . <p> Despite the effort , the best structural glues have limitations . At freezing temperatures some epoxies turn to sludge before they can be applied . Many give off toxic fumes when mixed at the job site . Adhesives also are prone to being pried apart . It can take years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Robert Gleim , a research director at Rohm &; Haas . <p> Worse , glues do n't allow for easy dismantling . This problem may be solved shortly : Six months ago EIC Laboratories in Norwood , Mass. came out with an epoxy that unbonds when zapped with a trickle of direct current . It has sold only a few hundred pounds . <p> Bolts and screws can be modeled with software to test stresses and strains , but gluemakers have yet to come up with a predictive model to simulate the behavior of a glued joint . " What happens at the surface between two materials is very complicated , " says James Wightman , professor emeritus of chemistry at Virginia Tech . <p> Continued growth in the use of structural glue depends as much on overcoming customers ' fear of liability as it does on new R &D.; Faith is hard won . After six years of research with British outfit Intelligent Engineering , Germany 's BASF finally earned a customer for its new steel-sandwich technology , which uses a polyurethane elastomer goo . <p> In January London-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck on its European Seafarer freighter . Ripping out the old deck and the labyrinth of piping beneath would have taken two months . Glue reduced that to just two weeks . Crews welded one-inch-high spacing bars onto the old deck in a waffle-like grid . Fresh steel plates were welded on top of the grid , with syrupy goo injected into the cavities between the decks . The stiff sandwich has impact resistance that is four times as great as that of the original deck . <p> Next spring BASF plans to use goop to build an entire steel hull . Now that 's some crazy glue . Glue Stew <p> It 's too expensive to design a glue from scratch . So adhesives makers tweak generic chemical formulas to get the exact characteristics they want . <p> INCREASE IMPACT RESISTANCE : Add rubber or thermoplastics . <p> INCREASE STIFFNESS AND STRENGTH : Add quartz , mica , calcium carbonate , rock . <p> REDUCE VISCOSITY IN COLD WEATHER : Add liquid chemicals called plasticizers . <p> PERFORM AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES : Add benzene rings to the resin polymer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardening agent . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Slather Time : Workers have 20 minutes to coat Trek bike tubes before the glue begins to cure . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Squeeze : The glued frame is sleeved together in a hydraulic clamp . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Ready to Bake : Secured in an alignment jig , the frame will cook in an oven to harden the glue . <p> By Brett Nelson <p>
