Craig Venter brought us the human genome . Now he aims to build a life form that will change the world . // The moment was vintage Craig Venter : Biology 's bad boy stood before a crowd of reporters in Washington , D.C. , trumpeting his latest achievement , with a beaming Spencer Abraham , the U.S. Secretary of Energy , by his side . Venter announced he had assembled a virus-a harmless , bacteria-infecting virus-from scratch , in his lab , in two weeks flat . The only other lab to attempt such a feat had taken three years . What was more , he went on , this was no mere test-tube sport . It was a small but important step in a much larger quest . Venter , in case you do n't remember , is the renegade scientist who in 1998 challenged the U.S. government in a race to sequence the human genome-and fought his giant rival to a history-making tie . He 's the same guy who was later ousted by the genomics company he had founded after failing to deliver on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the ultimate scientific ambition : To create new forms of life . Piecing together the virus was just a dry run . Venter plans to use commercially available snippets of DNA to assemble the smallest and simplest of genomes , a lab-made thread of just 300 genes , and insert it into a bacterium that has been stripped of its own genetic code . Then he 'll hold his breath and see whether the tiny microbe " boots up " and starts moving , metabolizing , and multiplying , all according to Venter 's reductionist version of life 's playbook . If the plan succeeds , a new creature will have entered the world . And Venter will have taken a bold , juicy bite of what some see as the forbidden fruit . He has big plans for his designer microbe . He calls it his model A and intends to use it as a chassis on which to build a fleet of bigger , more complex bacteria crafted to pump out pharmaceuticals and chemicals more cheaply and efficiently than they can be made today . Other bugs built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental and energy woes . They would capture carbon dioxide , derailing the greenhouse effect . They would clean up nuclear waste . They would generate hydrogen in quantities that could reshape the global energy economy . And as Energy Secretary Abraham attested at the November press conference , Uncle Sam is on board-the Department of Energy has backed Venter 's venture with $12 million of tax-payers ' money . " These dreams are not science fiction , " Abraham said . " The potential for this research to revolutionize our future is enormous . " Venter 's critics quickly came out in force . The press conference was a " sales sound bite , " charged Eckard Wimmer , a virologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , whose three-year virus-building effort Venter had portrayed as the slow boat to China . " Science by press release , " snorted Richard Ebright , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Rutgers University , adding that Venter 's virus synthesis " could not by any conceivable stretch of the imagination " be described as an important advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical School geneticist who , like Venter , is working on synthetic genomes , added with amusement , " Craig does have an excellent PR machine . " Thus begins act two for J. Craig Venter , gene sequencer extraordinaire . Nearly four years have passed since his triumph at a White House ceremony in which President Clinton acclaimed the deciphered genome as the " most important , most wondrous map ever produced by humankind . " Nearly two years have passed since Venter was ignominiously dumped as CEO of Celera Genomics , the gene-sequencing company he founded . Now , at 57 , the guy who is arguably the world 's most ambitious scientist ( which is really saying something ) is revved up again . " This project potentially will replace the entire pharmaceutical and chemical industry , " he says . The truth , as is almost always the case with Venter , lies somewhere between the hype of the press conference and the harsh charges of detractors . Venter has indeed found a clever , speedier method of melding small pieces of DNA into long strands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of stitching together a genome for his " model A " microbe . But did that warrant a press conference ? Or justify the Energy secretary 's toasting Venter 's work as a " critical accomplishment " ? Before we go further , let 's pause to clarify : Venter is n't literally trying to create life in a test tube , not the way you 've seen in science fiction movies-zapping a bunch of inert chemicals to produce , say , a silicon-based life form that breathes ammonia , basks in X-rays , and eats rocks . His minimal-genome quest is more akin to cloning-the cobbled-together DNA he inserts in a bacterium will depend on that bug 's own cellular machinery to work . But by pushing the frontiers of a new field called synthetic biology , he 's close enough to creating life in the lab to raise both mad-scientist fears and a host of safety concerns-of freakish new bugs that might infect people , or fall into the hands of terrorists , or escape to destroy the environment . We 'll come back to that later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sound . Venter and others are engaged in a kind of fast-forward microbial equivalent of the work our remote human ancestors did in domesticating birds and mammals . And industrial scientists have been tinkering with bugs for decadesthe agriculture and biotech industries use bacteria to make proteins , vaccines , and vitamins . But now microbe manipulation is moving into the 21st century . Last year , for example , University of Massachusetts biologist Derek Lovley used a common bacterium called Geobacter to clean up uranium-contaminated groundwater . The DOE paid for that work too . A bug like the one Venter wants to create , with the slimmest of genetic instruction books , would be immensely valuable commercially . Today 's industrial-duty bacteria come freighted with all kinds of genes not relevant to human purposes-such as backup systems evolved over eons to help the microbes survive in the wild . That genetic baggage consumes energy ; remove it somehow , the theory goes , and you can make industrial microbes far more efficient . The mainstream approach to streamlining genomes is more straightforward-and less scientifically risky-than what Venter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing lab and industrial bacteria . University of Wisconsin geneticist Fred Blattner has formed a private company , Scarab Genomics , to do just that . He has produced a stripped-down version of the scientific workhorse bacterium E. coll . Blattner hopes that his pruned-down " clean genome " bug will prove its safety and efficiency in the lab and in industry . Unlike Venter , Blattner says , " we are heading directly to the market with something that is technically feasible now . " Scientists at MIT are also working on pared-down versions of existing bugs . But Venter and other synthetic biologists say that approach is shortsighted . It confines scientists to working with the tiny fraction of bugs that will grow in the lab-a little like a drunk on the street at 2 A.M. hunting for his lost car keys under a lamppost , because that 's where the light is . Instead , the synthetic biologists propose to build genomes and create useful bugs from scratch . These new life formscall them synbugs-will hugely expand scientists ' power . By building into the synbug genes collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replicate the capabilities of millions of " wild " species that ca n't be grown in the lab . A handful of prominent researchers at places like Harvard and MIT are working on genome synthesis , but Venter is the only one so far who is daring to promise worldchanging results . But that 's Craig . He calls himself a " superenzyme " : a guy who , like a chemical catalyst , takes a slowas-molasses situation and speeds it up by orders of magnitude . That aggressiveness is evident as he parks his black Porsche ( in a no-parking zone ) in front of his state-of-theart DNA-sequencing facility in Rockville , Md . Put together in less than a year and outfitted with 100 ultrafast gene-sequencing machines , workspace for a staff of 90 , and a heavy-duty data center to crunch all the information that the sequencers generate , it exceeds the technological muscle he commanded at Celera . It 's one of perhaps three sequencing facilities of its caliber on the planet . For the project he has brought with him Hamilton Smith , the Nobel laureate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DOE grant , the project is running on Venter 's money-to fund his scientific ventures he established a $100million-plus endowment from his Clera stock profits and those from an ear lier partner company , Human Genome Sciences . Venter has penetrating blue eyes and a bald , sunburned head that attests to a love of sailing and sunny climes . he moves with the energy of an entrepreneur 30 years younger , and comes across with a mix of braggadocio ( " This is a $30 million room , " he volunteers during a tour of the sequencing lab ) and self-deprecation ( " At least some people like me , " he cracks about the collection of awards in his office ) . He was born in Salt Lake City just after World War II to an accountant dad and homemaker mom who had met in the Marines . Soon they moved to Millbrae , Calif. , where they began raising their four kids in a bungalow under the roar of planes landing at nearby San Francisco International airport . Craig , the No. 2 child , grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is now an insurance risk analyst . At high school in the early 1960s , Venter set records on the swim team but nearly flunked out ; he had no plans other than to chase girls and surf . Says his younger brother , Keith , now a NASA architect : " He just was n't motivated academically . That stuff was just so unimportant to him . " Vietnam changed that . Driven by horrifying experiences he had as a Navy medic at a field hospital in Da Nang , Venter zoomed to a bachelor 's degree and a Ph.D . in physiology and pharmacology in six years . Later , as a research scientist at the National Institutes of Health , he pioneered a technical shortcut that mightily hastened the hunt for genes . he and others used the method over the next three years to discover and decode tens of thousands of human genes . In 1995 , Venter became the first to sequence a whole bacterial genome , decoding the DNA of a bug called H. influenzae that causes pneumonia and often lethal childhood meningitis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the National Institutes of Health , who had refused to fund the project on the ground that the novel method he wanted to employ - known as whole-genome shotgun sequencing-would n't work . ( Whole-genome shotgun sequencing is a brute-force process in which all of a cell 's genes are shredded into millions of DNA snippets to be read , or " decoded , " by sequencing machines . Computers take the resulting morass of data and piece together the bits of code into sequences of whole genes . Imagine chopping 20 encyclopedias into a mountain of confetti , then reassembling the words , sentences , chapters , and volumes . ) James Watson , the Nobel laureate who co-discovered the double helix of DNA and who is no doubt the most distinguished of Venter 's many critics , matter-of-factly acknowledged his achievement as a " great moment in science . " Venter soon became intrigued by a big question : What is the minimum set of genes necessary for life ? Humans , animals , and plants have tens of thousands of genes , but single-celled creatures like those Venter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team led by Venter 's wife , Claire Fraser , herself a distinguished biologist , decoded the smallest-known genome of a free-living organism , a parasite called M genitalium that infects the human urinary tract . It has just 470 genes . Venter teamed with Fraser and others to explore how far M. genitalium could be trimmed . just as Venter shifted his attention to the humangenome race , the work led to a surprising result : Of the bug 's 470 genes , only an estimated 265 to 300 were essential to life . But the world did not know of Craig Venter until he took on Uncle Sam . In 1998 he announced the formation of Celera and its intention to sequence the human genome , start to finish , in three years . The firm was funded with $330 million from its parent , lab-machine maker Perkin Elmer , and equipped with 300 of the newest , fastest gene-sequencing machines , made by another Perkin Elmer subsidiary . At that point scientists in the government 's Human Genome Project had spent eight years mostly doing preparatory work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish the $3 billion project by 2005-a deadline that seemed in real danger of slipping . Within a month of Venter 's jump into the race , though , the Human Genome Project moved up its target to 2001 and federal officials began plowing in tens of millions of dollars more . Two years and buckets of bad blood later , Venter and the government scientists reluctantly shared credit for simultaneously completing their genome drafts . Though both drafts were full of holes-and are still being refined-it was a clear victory of quick-and-dirty science over the slow and painstakingly thorough approach many researchers favor . Venter 's triumph also marked a high point in the annals of egotism . During the genome race there had been rumors he was using his own DNA as the primary specimen for spelling out the human genome . That was completely contrary to what Celera was telling the world . The company made an elaborate effort to recruit a diverse pool of blood and sperm donors . Each volunteer read and signed a 30-page " informed consent " document that had been painstakingly developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the White House celebration Venter touted Celera 's multiethnic volunteer pool . " We did the sampling not in an exclusionary way , but out of respect for the diversity that is America , " he declared . Having a diversity of samples did n't matter from a scientific perspective , but it was symbolically important for the first reading of the human code . It was a big charade . Venter later acknowledged that most of the genes CeIera sequenced had been his very own . " Craig did what I feared he would do , " says Arthur Caplan , a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist who is Venter 's friend and who served on the advisory board . " He used his own DNA because he felt he had earned it . It was wrong . " Caplan ultimately published an indignant op-ed in the New York Times titled " His Genes , Our Genome . " Venter says he did it to set an example . Too many people , he says , are leery of undergoing genetic analysis for fear of job loss or insurance discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people should not be afraid to have their code sequenced and seen by others was to do it myself . " What 's more , he says , analyzing his genetic code indulged a deep , natural curiosity about his body 's makeup ; he 's writing a book about what he learned . The genome race made Venter not only famous but also rich . Celera went public in the spring of 1999 ; when the stock ballooned the next year , the value of his 5% stake approached $700 million . And however much his academic rivals hated his hot - dogging , they had to concede he 'd made it to the top of their heap too . He ranks in the top 0.05% of molecular biologists , according to the Institute for Seientific Information in Philadelphia , which measures influence by tracking how often scientists ' publications are cited by their peers . There was , of course , talk of a Nobel . Then things began to go wrong . Investors had poured billions into CeIera as it climbed from $7.20ashareinmid-1999 to $247 nine months later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's potential . he had promised to make it the " Bloomberg of biology " with 100 million customers by developing a oneof-a-kind database of genomic information . Celera had considerable success in signing up subscribers-especially big drug companies willing to pay top dollar for an early look at its findings . But there was no way to turn a profit big enough to justify a three-digit stock price . Less than a month after its peak , Celera 's stock fell to $92 a share ; by the end of 2000 it was at $36 . ( Full disclosure : This writer was silly enough to buy Clera in early 2000 . At a recent $15.41 a share , my $969 investment was worth $122.88 . ) The end for Venter came in January 2002 , when Celera 's board unanimously voted him out . he had to creep back into his office after midnight to collect his belongings . Venter retreated to Saint Barts , where he holed up on Sorcerer II , his new 95-foot yacht , in a deep funk . Shortly before leaving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer who had spent years at Venter 's elbow chronicling the genome race ( and whose vivid account , The Genome War , was published in January ) . " He was not the Craig I had followed around , " says Shreeve . " He was devastated . he looked smaller . he seemed unsure of himself in the crowd . " Later , on the yacht , Venter told Shreeve , " There is at least as good a chance that I 'll commit suicide as die from some disease . " He tried shopping therapy , buying a $5 million villa complete with a beautiful pool with a nine-foot waterfall , high on a mountainside overlooking the Caribbean . But the good life made him super-restless . Says brother Gary , about time they spent together that year at a house Venter owns on Cape Cod : " Fm seeing Craig out on the deck , drinking mojitos and trying to get into being a man of leisure . That would only last an hour . . . It seemed to be driving him crazy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig to resurface . In April he unveiled the J. Craig Venter Science Foundation . ( The $100-million-plus he gave the foundation accounts for more than 90% of the cash he took out of Celera , Venter says. ) he also announced he was returning to the minimal genome quest that had fascinated him before the human genome race had intervened . By yearend he had enlisted a small team , led by Nobelist Smith , to tackle the daunting array of challenges involved in creating a synthetic species . If all goes as Venter envisions it , the little M. genitalium bug he worked on in the mid-1990s will serve as the framework for his " model A. " The biggest hurdle is to figure out exactly which 300 or so genes will bring a cell to life . What 's more , no one has ever synthesized a genome remotely as large as the one Venter proposes . The biggest virus genome ever built in the lab is about 7,500 genetic code letters long ; Venter 's model A genome will be 40 times that size , dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce . Removing and replacing the bacterium 's DNA is another major obstacle . And even after that 's done , it 's unclear whether the bug will " boot up . " If it fails to do so , the team may not be able to figure out why , because the processes by which a bacterium executes its genetic code are so poorly understood . Any of those challenges could derail the project long before Venter can even begin outfitting bugs to produce medicine or capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere . A failure would confirm the suspicions of many scientists who think that this time Venter has overreached . Take the highly knowledgeable observer who dismisses Venter 's work as " tinkering . " So-called rational bacterial design-building bugs from the ground up , knowing exactly how they are going to perform when you launch them because you understand the most intimate details of their biochemical workings-is a century away , he says . " You and I wo n't be here . " Even fans are skeptical . Says Norton Zinder , an eminent molecular biologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy of Sciences in 2002 : " On paper it works , but there 's more than paper to living material . " Venter is working hard to demonstrate the practical potential of his enterprise . In a recent experiment sequencing the genomes of bacteria in the Sargasso Sea off Bermuda , he found thousands of new species of microbes containing more than a million hitherto unknown genes . That 's about ten times the total number of genes discovered in all species to date . he will publish details of his findings in an upcoming paper in the journal Science . Among other things , he says , " we 've literally come up with hundreds of new chemical pathways and genes that might enable us to generate hydrogen biologically . " Venter is happy to provide other tantalizing suggestions of what may be possible if his synthetic genome succeeds . Consider Taxol , the breakthrough medicine used to treat breast and ovarian cancer . It is derived from the bark of the yew tree ; three to six of the large , slow-growing trees are needed to provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year . A semisynthetic form of the drug based on a chemical from the needles of the yew is still costly and hard to produce , and making Taxol from scratch in a test tube is prohibitive . With a minimal-genome microbe in hand , says Venter , " we would start today and go sequence the genome of the yew tree . Get the gene pathways for making Taxol . And put them in the synthetic cell and make Taxol . " He also loves to talk about an exotic organism called Methanococcus jannaschu . It lives at ultra-high temperatures near volcanic vents in the deep ocean , feeding on carbon dioxide and spitting out minute amounts of methane-the natural gas used for power and home heating . Venter and his colleagues sequenced the bug 's genome in 1996 . In a Venterian world scientists would identify and harvest the particular genes that let it do its tricks , insert multiple copies of those genes into a synbug to amplify its methane-making ability , andpresto ! - create a biological energy source that 's economically competitive and environmentally saintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human-genome race is nothing compared to the controversy his current project is likely to kick up if it starts breeding synbugs . From the start Venter has tried to defuse criticism by seeking the blessing of the ethics establishment . A University of Pennsylvania bioethics panel signed off on his proposal to build a minimal genome in 1999-but not without caution , says Caplan , who sat on the panel . " We did n't see any reasons not to proceed , " he says , " but we saw many things to pay attention to . " Those included the work 's potential biowarfare applications and the environmental risks posed by escaped bugs . The risks have n't changed , Caplan says ; science is still sorely in need of rules governing synthetic biology . " Nothing that has happened with genetically modified plants and animals makes me feel secure that those rules are in place , " he says . " The time to draft them is now , when research is just beginning . " Others believe Venter needs to be stopped . " He 's trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own version of a second genesis , " says Jeremy Rifkin , the longtime technology gadfly . Rifkin worries that , whatever reassurances Venter may offer , he ca n't control the consequences when-not if-a bug makes it into the environment or into criminal hands . " It 's the height of hubris . It 's irresponsible . he ca n't tell you that it 's going to be safe . " Even so , the U.S. government , despite its post-9/11 cautiousness , has seen no problem in helping fund Venter 's work . The scientific paper documenting how he built a virus from scratch received extensive security vetting by the administration , which gave it a pass . Venter pooh-poohs the fears . " There 's very little motivation for somebody to resort to complex molecular biology " to commit biological terrorism , he says . A terrorist " can get infectious agents from any hospital .... he can easily get anthrax from any farm . " As for the environmental worries , he claims that any bug he synthesizes in the lab will be so delicate that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being written , Venter is back aboard Sorcerer II . This time he 's in the South Pacific , bound for the Galapagos . There , where Charles Darwin unlocked the secrets of the natural world , Venter is seeking raw material for his brave new one . He 's collecting seawater samples and will come back to sequence the millions of organisms he retrieves . Very likely they 'll yield new genes to help soup up his model A-if he ever gets it running . Sidebar He has big plans for his designer microbe , which he calls his model A. And Uncle Sam is on board . Sidebar Synbugs would let science replicate valuable abilities of " wild " bacteria that ca n't be grown in the lab . Sidebar Imagine chopping 20 encyclopedias into confetti , then accurately reassembling the volumes . Sidebar Eventually it emerged that Venter had used his own DNA in sequencing the human genome . Sidebar " He 's trying to short-circuit evolution , " says a critic . " He ca n't tell you it 's going to be safe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
