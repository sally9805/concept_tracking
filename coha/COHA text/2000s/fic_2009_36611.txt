One-World , 1001 A. D. <p> I sat on a large rock on a hillside and fought my rope restraints . The task was next to hopeless . My captors had wrenched my elbows up behind my back , shoved a pole between them , then lashed my wrists so tight across my stomach , my elbow joints and wrists screamed in agony . Hobbling my feet , they roped me to a tree . <p> Nonetheless , I struggled to turn sideways , hoping to use the tree trunk to push the pole out from between my elbows . Free of the pole , I would then cut my binds on a jagged rock . <p> An angry commotion announced Tenoch 's return . The leader of our party , he was notoriously ill-tempered . He hurled a deer to the ground perhaps twenty paces from my feet . Little more than bones and parchment , the shriveled deer would n't even satisfy our twenty hunters much less the hundreds of our clan , who camped by a waterhole a day 's walk to the north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thundered obscenities at them for not flushing a fatter deer or stealing the corn , peppers , and beans he 'd wanted . <p> Then he turned his wrath and his whip on his slave , Desert Flower , and for the ten thousandth time in my life , I swore I would kill that devil . <p> Young and attractive , Flower was a poor woman whom Tenoch had forced into the expedition to attend to his physical needs , despite the elders ' prohibitions . Tenoch had spurned their counsel , insisting that he needed her to dress out his kills , cook his meals , carry his gear  --  and endure his violently depraved debaucheries . Tenoch 's abuse of her hurt me worse than his assaults on me . Born , like myself , during the first year of the Great Drought , we were each going on our sixteenth summer , and we were each Tenoch 's property . Both of us suffered under his whip , but she had it infinitely worse . Shy and small of frame , she was compassion incarnate with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and tiny sensitive mouth expressed her caring nature quickly and unmistakably  --  her plea sure at sudden acts of kindness and her displeasure at deliberate cruelty . Tenoch despised such displays . <p> When he saw her so moved , he flogged her like a fiend freed from ictlantecuhtli 's hell . <p> He was still screaming about the scrawny deer and the failure to find produce . Of course , the food shortage was no one 's fault . There was little food to be found . The weather had been drier than old bones for more seasons than I could remember . The crops had withered , and the emaciated game was increasingly scarce . <p> Even worse , our Aztec people now paid for that scarcity in blood . Increasing their annual blood-tithes tenfold , Toltec priests roamed our countryside , abducting anyone they could get their hands on , dragging them back to Tula , where they immolated them en masse after cutting out their hearts . They emptied their victims ' blood in scarlet torrents down the temple troughs and hurled their severed heads down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back Tlaloc , our bloodthirsty thunder god , or watered our maize fields . <p> Our people were starving , and hunger had forced us into Toltec land to poach that deer . Fierce bands of Toltec hunters were everywhere , but Tenoch had reasoned he could offer me to those warriors as recompense for the deer and thus escape their wrath . Content with the gift of a sacrificial prisoner , they 'd haul me back to Tula and deliver me to their bloodthirsty priests . <p> What ever the case , we 'd had no choice but to poach on Toltec land . I was also an obvious choice for the sacrificial victim . An orphaned babe , found in a reed basket by a river bank , I was a slave with no rights . So here I was : I would either starve to death trussed to a tree or die on a pyramid under a priest 's black blade . <p> Before I could curse my fate , however , hell exploded . Half of our twenty hunter-warriors collapsed before me , arrows impaling their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , clutching at an arrow that skewered his throat , gore gushed from his wound . Another stared sightlessly at a feathered shaft sunk deep between his eyes . Four others were mortally pierced through the chest . <p> Another near-simultaneous arrow-volley took out six more of our men . <p> Eight attackers erupted from the tree line , dispatching the survivors with obsidian-bladed axes and black knives . Like ourselves , these loinclothed men were stripped down to their heavily tattooed torsos , and limbs ; and , like ourselves , they sported nose , ear , and lip ornaments . The resemblance , however , ended there . Our warriors wore simple , coarse-cloth maxtlatl loincloths made of fibers worked from maguey plants ; these soldiers were dressed in bright loincloths , with higher-ranking warriors wearing mantles and headdresses . While this enemy attacked with shocking swiftness , rigorous teamwork , and unerring precision , our few surviving warriors panicked like children , either fleeing or cowering , each man looking out solely for himself . <p> At their head , three paces in front of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaking his high status  --  even from where I stood I could see that the maxtlatl between his legs was made of costly dyed cotton . The mantle that was tied at his shoulders and draped down his back was covered with images of wild animals , skulls and bones , and demonic gods . <p> Unlike our skinny soldiers , these were powerfully built killers  --  men with rocklike biceps , block-like shoulders , massively muscular legs and chests . Nor were their weapons tipped with coarsely chipped flint , as were ours , but ebony-hued , sharply honed obsidian  --  blades now glistening with the blood of my adopted people . <p> A severed head lay beside a pair of headless shoulders . Another warrior lay on his side with a javelin protruding from both chest and back . Only one victim still moved , writhing in his death spasms , his limbs convulsing , blood pumping from his neck and stomach . Another , who had tried to scale a tree , was now affixed to that sought-after sanctuary , a lance pinning his chest to the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of our entire band , only two others survived : Tenoch , who lay on the ground unconscious  --  thanks to a towering , muscular warrior who had clubbed him into bloody oblivion  --  and Desert Flower . <p> Emerging from the forest , a ninth man walked through the camp  --  an elderly dignitary who had not participated in the fray . <p> His clothing confirmed his importance among his people . His loincloth was richly embroidered in vivid shades of red and green and yellow , with sparkling gems delicately weaved into the cloth . Hanging from knots were tiny bells of gold . <p> His mantle was long , falling from his shoulders almost to the ground . As colorful as his loincloth and as costly , it was lavishly decorated and fringed with gold . <p> He was at an age in life when most men no longer marched with an army unless their role was planning as opposed to leading warriors into battle . <p> As he stood over me and stared down , I knew what he was looking at : the star patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my white loincloth . <p> " Who put these drawings on you ? " he asked . <p> He spoke Nahuatl , the same language as the Aztecs , though his diction and accent were different from ours . <p> " I painted the ones on my loincloth . " <p> " Why ? " <p> The question stumped me . I had never thought of why I had drawn them . I gave him the answer that came to my mind . " It 's what I see in the sky at night . " <p> Kneeling next to me , he examined the scars on my abdomen , fingering the pattern of scars . <p> " Where did you get these designs ? " he asked . <p> The words were spoken almost in a whisper . <p> " I do n't know , " I told him , truthfully . " They were on me when they found me . " <p> " Who found you ? " <p> " The Clansmen  --  " <p> " Dog People found you ? Where ? When ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a basket , next to a river . " <p> The nobleman stood up . " Do not hurt this one , " he announced to the warriors . <p> Suddenly I felt a chill , and a shadow fell over me . A startlingly tall , shockingly muscled warrior had come up beside me silent as the grave . Possessing a hawk 's nose , wide flaring cheekbones and blood-streaked shoulder-length hair , black as a raven 's underwing , he was an imposing specimen . <p> He wore the close-fitting loincloth and white padded-cotton shirt of a warrior , but his shield and helmet told me he was far more important than a mere commander of what appeared to be a small force  --  only eight soldiers plus the elderly nobleman . The warrior 's shield bore the image of a jaguar , and his headdress included the actual head of a jaguar as well as the brilliant green and red plumes of rare birds . <p> Jaguar Knight . <p> I had never seen an actual knight , but I knew from cooking-fire talk that the Toltec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Coyote . The Coyote Knights were in charge of the Toltec forces that guarded its northern border , the one it shared with us Dog People . The Jaguar Knights guarded the king . <p> What was a Jaguar Knight doing so far from his king ? <p> Who was this man ? <p> Glancing up at him , I was surprised to find his eyes were . . . kind . <p> He was the man who had subdued my tormenter , Tenoch . <p> " What is happening , Citali ? " he asked . <p> Citali . Stargazer . So the elderly nobleman was a shaman , like my adopted father . A very important person in any Clan  --  often the most important . <p> " He bears a sign of the stars , " Stargazer said . " I have placed him under my protection . " <p> The Jaguar Knight glared down at me . " He 's of the Dog People . Probably the son of a village shaman . " The knight kicked me . " What 's your name , Aztec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I hoped it would be offensive to the gods for a Jaguar Knight to kill one who bore the name of a brethren order . <p> Stargazer chuckled . " The writing , the scars , the name  --  Chi-malpopoca , this young man is not fated to die this day . . . or end up sacrificed . Not yet . . . " he said to me . <p> Chimalpopoca  --  Smoking Shield . <p> Smoking Shield appeared as puzzled about the significance of the scars as I had been . . . but was just as frightened of the unknown as I was to question what the gods had written . <p> Even if neither of us understood what it meant . <p> He stared at my bare , tattooed abdomen . <p> " Relax , young friend , " he finally said , raising his eyes . " I was only admiring your body art along with Stargazer . " Turning to the old man , he said : " We do n't murder the young , do we , old man ? " He slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come to dinner with us to night . Enjoy your venison . We will simmer it in a pot of ripe maize , plump red beans , succulent onions , and scorchingly hot chilis even as we wash it down with octli . Afterward , you will get a good night 's sleep . We leave at dawn . " <p> " I 'm going with you ? " <p> " Indeed . " <p> " Where do we travel ? " <p> " Who knows ? All of life is an adventure . To night , we will eat , and drink to the gods . Tomorrow we face the far horizons .
