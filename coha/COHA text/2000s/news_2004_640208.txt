<p> This is the week to hone your second-guesses and sharpen your ' I told you so 's . ' <p> Tuesday brings the Oscar nominations , and during the long wait for Sunday 's Super Bowl , ragging on the Academy Award picks is a socially acceptable form of Monday-morning quarterbacking . <p> When it comes to handicapping the Oscar nominations , there are locks , there are dark horses , and there is more than a little wishful thinking . <p> The one or two uncertain spots in each category leave predictors torn between guessing what the 5,000-plus Academy voters might do and what would happen if the universe were run by critics . <p> With that in mind , here is how tomorrow 's nominees are likely to turn out : <p> Best Picture <p> ' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King ' is the one true ' bet the farm ' pick among the five possible nominations . Though many people did not like the third installment as much as the first two , sheer mass promises a guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' Mystic River ' has battled ' Cold Mountain ' since late fall as the season 's ' serious ' movie . Director Clint Eastwood drew stellar performances from Sean Penn , Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon , making it a critical and popular favorite despite a pervasively dark tone . <p> ' Master and Commander ' lost some of its early buzz , but sails on under the power of Russell Crowe and the beautiful water world created by Peter Weir . May get picked just for being 10 times better than ' Last Samurai . ' <p> ' Lost in Translation ' is an actors ' showcase , a rare chance to reward a female director , and the kind of smaller-budget mood piece that , while thin on plot , often sneaks inside the Oscar fence . <p> ' Cold Mountain , ' ' Seabiscuit ' and ' In America ' seem to be competing for the fifth and final Academy spot this year . ' Cold Mountain ' has the Hollywood cred of literature , Anthony Minghella and bigtime stars but did not win universal raves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forgotten summer release , but it 's the kind of feel-good winner that steals votes . ' In America ' has the biggest heart of all the potential nominees , but too few may have seen it . <p> Best Director <p> Peter Jackson is a far more obvious choice for this category than he might be in most years , with many fans wanting a ' body of work ' reward for the three ' LOTR ' installments . <p> Clint Eastwood brought a determined vision to ' Mystic River , ' making it his best movie since ' Unforgiven . ' Hollywood loves his no-nonsense approach to budgets and schedules . Shoo-in for a nomination , unlikely as a winner . <p> Sofia Coppola has a great shot at breaking into an elite group despite sporting the wrong age and gender . Middle-aged white men locked up Oscars for years - Jane Campion was the last female nominee , in 1993 . Voters are enchanted with the performances she drew from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson for ' Lost in Translation . ' <p> Peter Weir joins the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander ' was not as perfect as some critics wanted it to be . From epic to insightful comedy to tragedy , Weir does it all . <p> Anthony Minghella is more certain as a pick for best director than his movie is for best picture . He shepherded Charles Frazier 's literary masterpiece onto the screen with justified confidence , marrying poetry to realism with unique skill . <p> While their movies may retain a small hope for best picture , Gary Ross for ' Seabiscuit ' and Jim Sheridan for ' In America ' are even greater long shots for directing kudos . <p> Best Actor <p> Sean Penn : There 's not a gesture wasted or overblown in <p> Penn 's depiction of Jimmy Markum . From the brief moment he shares with his daughter to his anguished howl at her murder to his quiet taunting of Kevin Bacon 's police detective , Penn embodies all the conflicts roiling in ' Mystic River . ' There is only one reason why Penn would be denied this year 's Oscar : If his own bad-boy persona eclipses his portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy members . <p> Bill Murray : As ' Lost in Translation 's ' Bob Harris , an action movie star on the downslope of his career , Murray serves up a potent yet smoothly blended cocktail of the wry , the melancholy and the yearning . <p> Ben Kingsley : The veteran pulls off a touching trick as ' House of Sand and Fog 's ' Iranian Air Force Col. Massoud Amir Behrani : He makes an infuriatingly prideful man sympathetic . His performance is a study in how complex human character can be from the getgo . <p> Jude Law : The quiet man in this category , Law 's portrayal of Inman in ' Cold Mountain ' is all nuance and focus and vulnerability . There are moments when Law seems like a silent film actor working in the midst of an epic movie 's sound and fury . <p> Russell Crowe : His performance in ' Master and Commander : The Far Side of the World ' is impeccable - a class act performing in a class act . But in a year that gave us such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a tribute less to the grandness of the role than to the undeniability of Crowe 's onscreen authority . <p> Johnny Depp : It 's a mutinous thought , but if a ship 's captain is going to be nominated , it should be this one . Johnny Depp 's wholly original turn as Jack Sparrow in ' Pirates of the Caribbean : Curse of the Black Pearl ' is n't just the best comic act of the year , it is one of the best performances . <p> Best Actress <p> Charlize Theron : It 's easy to think that it is merely this beauty 's physical metamorphosis into a beast that has garnered her such front-runner buzz . But Theron 's transformation was more than skin deep . She inhabits serial killer Aileen Wuornos ' need and defiance , her badness and her madness , with a stunning compassion . <p> Naomi Watts : In ' 21 Grams , ' Watts more than proves that her mighty fine work in David Lynch 's mighty weird ' Mulholland Drive ' was n't a fluke . As Cristina - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident - Watts cycles through grief , fury and hopelessness with aching precision . <p> Diane Keaton : This actress ' return to the screen and the Oscar race may strike some as evidence of Hollywood 's fondness for fabulous comebacks and sentimental favorites . But this nomination is a testament to just how good Keaton is in maneuvering Erica Barry 's humor and heartbreak . In ' Something 's Got ta Give , ' Keaton occasionally does that dance of joy and misery in the very same frame . <p> Cate Blanchett : Here 's another one of those Aussie actors who plies her trade with consistent brilliance . In fact , there is a fair amount of confusion about which role should earn Blanchett a nomination . Will it be as Irish journalist Veronic Guerin in the movie of the same name ? Or for her depiction of a frontier woman whose daughter is kidnapped in ' The Missing ' ? The Golden Globes gave ' Guerin ' the nod , but Oscar buzz points toward ' The Missing . ' <p> Nicole Kidman : Oscar 's date for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her role as Ada in ' Cold Mountain . ' And they were right , for Ada is nowhere near as astonishing as Kidman 's portrayal of Virginia Woolf or the other actresses being mentioned in this category . But the Academy has an understandable affection for Kidman and may decide two fine performances ( in ' Cold Mountain ' and ' The Human Stain ' ) equals one nomination . <p> Jennifer Connelly : The SAG gave Patricia Clarkson ( " The Station Agent " ) the nod over Kidman . But if the Academy swaps someone into the mix , Connelly ( who won a best supporting statuette for " A Beautiful Mind " ) would be a good bet . Like her " House of Sand and Fog " co-star Ben Kingsley , Connelly delivers a character both sympathetic and aggravating.  --  <p> The envelope , please <p> Academy Award nominations will be announced Tuesday morning . The Denver Post 's Lisa Kennedy and Michael Booth think these first three films are certain nods for best picture , while the last four films are battling it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rings <p> Lost in Translation <p> Mystic River <p> Master and Commander <p> Cold Mountain <p> In America <p> Seabiscuit
