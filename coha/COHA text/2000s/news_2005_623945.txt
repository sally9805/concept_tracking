<p> Free cafeteria food , annual ski trips to the Sierra and free laundry are just some of the fringe benefits of working at Google . Getting hired is the trick . <p> Every month , aspiring workers deluge the popular Mountain View search engine with up to 150,000 resumes , equivalent to a stack of paper at least 50 feet high . And the firm claims to read each and every one . <p> As one of Silicon Valley 's hottest companies , Google has become a beacon for job seekers . In just a few short years , the interest has helped the company amass an arsenal of what is arguably among the world 's top technology minds . <p> " I would argue that definitely they have the best talent , " said Joe Kraus , a co-founder of the Web portal Excite Inc. and who currently leads a startup , JotSpot , in Palo Alto . " They invest so much because the more great talent you have , the easier it is to attract even more great talent . " <p> Google hires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the number of employees has more than tripled to 4,989 . <p> The growth spurt is being fueled by a gangbusters-like online advertising market and Google 's boundless ambition , including new initiatives in everything from wireless Internet access to video downloads . The goal is to keep the production line of new products humming so that users spend more time on the Web site . <p> Getting rich is what drives some of the applicants . Many Google workers became instant millionaires at the time of the company 's initial stock offering in 2004 . To this day , prospective employees are drawn by the promise of wealth , although their chances of striking gold are a lot lower now that the firm 's shares are soaring above $400 , making stock options less likely to appreciate by large amounts . <p> Competition for the best and brightest is fierce . Rivals Yahoo Inc. , in Sunnyvale , and Microsoft Corp. , in Redmond , Wash. , plus startups , are trying to reel in many of the same job applicants , igniting occasional bidding wars . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has recently landed some workers who interviewed at Google , such as Andrei Broder , a former research executive at AltaVista and IBM . He says being at Yahoo 's research lab is an opportunity to have more impact because it 's younger and smaller than those of its competition . <p> Sergey Brin , Google 's co-founder , has called hiring one of his firm 's biggest challenges . If unable to find enough top-notch workers , he says the company 's rapid growth could be hamstrung . <p> Google 's also hiring superstars . This year , they include Vint Cerf , one of the Internet 's founding fathers , as chief Internet evangelist . Kai-Fu Lee , a former Microsoft executive and expert in technology that turns speech into text , now heads operations in China . And Louis Monier , founder of the early search engine AltaVista , has an undisclosed technical role . <p> To lure workers , Google offers perks , including free cafeteria meals , free use of laundry machines , a child care center , a free annual one-night ski trip ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices and an on-site doctor . Engineers can devote 20 percent of their time to projects of their choice . What 's not mentioned is that much of the largesse is designed to keep workers at their desks longer . <p> In addition to posting job openings in newspapers and online , Google recruits at universities , offers computer science students free pizza , hosts a software programming competition , and invites technology clubs to hold their meetings at its headquarters . <p> Last year , the company won attention for publishing a booklet of 21 problems , called the Google Labs Aptitude Test . Readers of several technology magazines were asked to mail in their answers and promised that Google would get in touch with them if they scored well . <p> One question asked : " In your opinion , what is the most beautiful math equation ever derived ? " The Gaussian integral , a complex mathematical equation used in studying the kinetic molecular theory of gases , among other things , has been suggested as a smart answer by some on the Internet . Another question involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptiness , " leaving applicants scratching for a subjective winner . <p> Judy Gilbert , Google 's staffing programs director , says that the questions were n't really used for hiring . In any case , smart alecks soon posted the answers online so that they could be easily found by cheaters . <p> " It was a great PR move , and we got a lot of interest from it , " Gilbert said . " As far as using those kinds of things to decide who becomes part of our team , we typically use more traditional processes . " <p> Many contractors ' resumes <p> Hundreds of recruiters keep the resumes pouring into Google . Many are contractors , making them easier to dismiss if the company scales back its hiring needs . <p> Jobs available as of last week include someone to negotiate video licensing deals with Hollywood studios , someone to lead user studies for guiding product design , and an attorney to manage the firm 's real estate . More posts are likely to open in announcements this week that the company will create 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To land all-stars , Google 's recruiting machine goes into overdrive . Take the case of Lee , the former Microsoft executive . Details of his hiring emerged in a lawsuit that Microsoft filed against Google . <p> After hearing about Lee 's interest in Google , one executive told colleagues that they should pursue him " like wolves , " according to an e-mail made public in the case . Another executive eagerly voiced his interest in an e-mail to Lee , saying " please call me as soon as possible , 24 hours a day . " <p> Secrecy is sometimes critical . If tipped off , companies from which Google is trying to poach could start a bidding war or retaliate against a potential defector . <p> For Lee , Google 's executives were reminded in a message to keep quiet , even to spouses and significant others . His interviews started at a remote , little-used building on the Google office complex so that only a few people would ever know he was there before they shifted to an off-campus location . <p> The risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's caliber . He ultimately accepted a compensation package of more than $10 million , igniting the legal battle between Google and Microsoft . <p> To fill positions lower on the pecking order , Google has created an extensive college hiring program , among other efforts . Recruiters visited 60 schools this year to show off the firm 's technology , hand out T-shirts and interview prospective job candidates . <p> Many students interested <p> Rich Wong , associate director of MBA recruiting for UC Berkeley 's Haas School of Business , said that his students responded warmly to Google 's courting . More than 100 of them were bused by the company to its headquarters for management presentations , networking and tours . Never before had a firm gotten so many of the school 's MBA students to visit , Wong said . <p> " This is the first year that Google has really recruited at Haas , " Wong said . " This is a great breakthrough because there is a great student interest . " <p> Some go to extra lengths to land a job , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hire me , Google . " Another , Michael Kazin , a Rutgers University senior in computer science , volunteered to be his New Jersey school 's pizza ambassador . <p> As part of its recruiting , Google offers free pizza to computer science study groups and clubs at universities across the country . Kazin 's role is to make sure the Rutgers groups get reimbursed from Google . <p> " I love Google , " said Kazin , who has had a phone interview with Google for a job and is waiting to hear back . " I thought this would give me one leg up in the recruiting process . " <p> Interviews at Google usually begin on the telephone . If successful , applicants are invited for face-to-face meetings with up to 10 people , a process described as excruciating by people who have gone through them because of the length of time it takes and the mental gymnastics necessary . <p> Recent job candidates described questions as being on topic , whether about software code or business . In many cases , they were asked to brainstorm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , how would they market a product ? Those who conduct the interviews frequently challenge applicants . Questions about algorithms , Java software and computer networking are common for applicants seeking technical positions . <p> It 's a slight change from Google 's early days , when Brin , the co-founder , would quiz applicants and then give them five minutes to prepare a presentation about anything complicated that he did n't already know , according to Doug Edwards , a former Google marketing director who was subjected to such a test six years ago . <p> Importance of college grades <p> Google has created its own software system for tracking job candidates that allows employees to share comments on each applicant . Because so many people must sign off on new hires  --  Larry Page , one of the firm 's famed co-founders , approves each one  --  the process can be lengthy , even excessively so , several applicants said . <p> Some were shocked to learn the importance Google gives to college grade point averages in deciding whom to hire . The emphasis draws complaints from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them because they have been out of school for so long . <p> Gilbert , the staffing programs director , responded : " We know that grade point averages are highly imperfect measures . But you try to get a complete set of data . " <p> In general , Gilbert says Google seeks applicants who show they are willing to take risks , are highly motivated by a range of topics and want to be part of something bigger than themselves . The profile is in line with the firm 's carefully crafted iconoclastic image . <p> Historically , Google has paid workers less than the industry standard and showered them with stock options . That paid off for approximately 1,000 Google employees in 2004 , when the company 's high-profile initial stock offering made them instant millionaires . Although the firm 's present pay structure is a closely guarded secret , one can assume hundreds , if not thousands , more have become worth seven figures , at least on paper , considering that Google 's stock is now hovering above the $400 mark , a nearly five-fold increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After its initial public offering last year , the company has had to offer more money up front because options are n't as valuable , according to compensation experts . Many competing firms claim Google has driven up salaries for software programmers by nearly 50 percent in recent years . <p> On the flip side , low-end workers such as customer service representatives start around $45,000 , according to someone familiar with the firm 's recruiting practices who requested anonymity . And that 's certainly not exorbitant by industry standards , the expert said , adding that Google trades on its name to offer lower salaries for lesser jobs at times . <p> Stephen Arnold , the author of the book " The Google Legacy : How Google 's Internet Search is Transforming Application Software , " says that the company has proved its mettle in hiring quality technology workers . What 's yet to be proved is whether the company can be as successful hiring workers on the business side . <p> " Google , because of its visibility , has been able to attract the best of the nerd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do the same thing in all these other silos  --  marketing , legal , finance  --  and I 'm not sure they would know whether they 're the best even if they were standing right in front of them . " <p> Giving a taste of the culture <p> Dror Shimshowitz , who went from Haas graduation in May to a job as a Google product marketing manager , says he had n't really considered applying until relatively late in his studies . After getting no response to a resume he sent to the company 's general recruiting Web site , he talked to an insider he knew , who then recommended him for an interview . <p> " The interviews really pushed me  --  they pushed my thinking , " Shimshowitz said , recalling questions such as , " How do you get millions of people to use a product ? " <p> " I got a great taste of what the culture is like here , " he said . <p> Eventually , Shimshowitz chose Google over several other job offers , including one from a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a trade-off , he said , because Google normally hires workers as generalists , unlike other companies that tell new hires more precisely what their role will be . <p> " For the first time in my career , I 'm not planning my next move , " Shimshowitz said . <p> If you get in ... <p> A test published by Google last year in several magazines was used as a recruiting tool .
