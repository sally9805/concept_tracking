Poland , 1920 <p> In darkness they at last reach the bridge at B- , which the retreating Poles in their fury have dynamited . Undaunted , the division commander consults his maps by lamplight and gives the order : " We will wade across . " Horses , creaking carts , tachankas-the long column streams down the bank and plunges headlong into the black , slow river , past the fallen bridge . See him there , the young reporter , before fame touched him , before his fall , as he once wished himself seen , among soldiers . " So beautiful , " the commissar murmurs beside him , dipping his hand in the water as their wagon pushes through muck and soft reeds and settles heavily in the current . <p> They are halfway across when K suddenly appears beside the wagon , crouched atop his beautiful horse like a circus gypsy , singing ; it is this same raw energy which inspired the young reporter to describe the Cossack in his first and so far only published dispatch for Red Cavalryman , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorite among the men ; favorite and source of amusement . " Remind us again , hero , where you got your little pony ? What was that poor Yid 's name whose skull you split open ? " lies , K insists ; the others are merely jealous of him and his newfound celebrity . " My father gave me this horse , " the Cossack announces fiercely , as if daring anyone to argue . The young reporter keeps his mouth shut . It is better that way , he consoles himself . If the Cossack is a thief , let history deal with him . <p> The scouts return at daybreak . There is another village up ahead , just beyond the next hill : a handful of huts , derelict farms , a lonely , half-looted church , and , farther along , a squat square schoolhouse fronting a small cottage . Each floats in glaring sunlight in the young reporter 's field glasses , and each building is as desolate as the country looming around it . Except the school-house , he discovers . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of it , and as the column approaches , a man emerges from the schoolhouse , waving his arms . " Comrades , " he calls out in Russian . " Welcome , brothers . Welcome . " <p> He is the village schoolmaster . It is his red flag dangling like a cravat from the bell tower . As the column continues past , he and the young reporter stand in the fretwork of shade beneath the bell tower , drinking water from a tin cup . " This is the fourth appointment I 've had in five years , " the schoolmaster confides , brushing the dust off his striped trousers . " The first three , as soon as my neighbors found out I was a Marxist , they sent me packing . " He smiles faintly , and the young reporter smiles back . The water they share tastes of metal . " May I show you something ? " the schoolmaster asks . <p> " Of course . " <p> Together they cross the schoolyard . <p> " Actually it 's a good thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think some of my older students were beginning to talk to their parents about me , which is how it always starts . First the students talk , then the parents talk . The next thing you know , people are poisoning your dog . Which was what happened in the last village . Very unpleasant . " <p> Just then one of the junior officers stumbles from the schoolmaster 's cottage with a portable phonograph cradled in his arms like a lamb . " What are you doing with that , brother ? " asks the schoolmaster . Requisition , the soldier says . Inside the cottage they discover the others , officers and enlisted men alike , stripping the room to the baseboards ; furniture , photographs , rugs , it is all being carried away . <p> " I 'll make sure you are issued the proper receipts , " the young reporter promises , blushing with shame . It is all he can do : as a noncombatant attached to the division , as a reporter , a writer of agitprop . <p> " Receipts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses . " <p> Later , in back of the cottage , in a little library crowded with shelves , the schoolmaster crouches to retrieve a book . Behind him , a single sun-struck window overlooks a garden , fields . <p> " Old friend , " the schoolmaster murmurs . <p> It is the prophet himself , the young reporter sees , a nearly perfect early printing of Marx 's Das Kapital , which the older man commences to recite , from memory , in his sonorous , slightly hoarse lecturer 's voice-in the original German , no less . It is only when the others in the next room begin to kick holes in the walls that he stops , pulling a handkerchief from his pocket and wiping the sweat from his brow . <p> " Please , go on , " the young reporter says . <p> He does . Outside , K 's horse , turned loose to graze , has found its way in from the fields and discovered the schoolmaster 's garden , around which a waist-high fence of wattle and chicken wire leans on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse stretches its long , linen-colored neck over the wattle fence and , as the young reporter watches , begins to delicately eat the flowers off one of the rosebushes ; the blood-red petals that spill from its mouth are like the petals slaves once scattered at the feet of emperors , kings . <p> By nightfall the schoolmaster is gone , sent back of the line where he will be safe , the commissar assures the young reporter . Safe from what , the commissar will not say . The young reporter finds him sitting alone in the empty schoolhouse , censoring letters . " Why are you so worried about him ? " the commissar asks . " What do you care ? " <p> " He 's a Marxist . " <p> " He is a dilettante , " the commissar says dismissively . The flickering lamp casts gloomy shadows across the rows of tables and benches . Its light shines wetly on the knobs of the wooden coat pegs on the wall behind the desk , and on the commissar 's crisply parted , oiled black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The scratching pen pauses . " How 's your next article progressing , by the way ? " <p> From the plains far north of the village , intermittently , comes the faint thunder of artillery-another division clearing the way west to Warsaw . <p> " Slowly , " the young reporter says . In fact he has written virtually nothing since that night they crossed the river ; only notes , sketches . He has , for the moment , lost his bearings . <p> " Our men need encouragement , " the commissar says . " You must give them hope . It is your responsibility to give them hope . " His expression softens . " You know , I 'm something of an admirer of yours . I used to read New Life religiously . Your articles in particular . " <p> " You 're from Petrograd ? " the young reporter asks . <p> " Yes . " <p> They are both quiet a moment . <p> " I suppose , " the commissar says finally , " it must be a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My new role , the young reporter thinks . As what exactly ? As reporter ? As propagandist ? In fact he is expected by his editors at Red Cavalrymen to balance both duties , if such a balance is possible : he is to be both journalist and tender of hopes . <p> The commissar tilts back in his chair . He is , for all his boundless confidence , himself a young man still . " He speaks German , you know . Your Marxist . Quite fluently . One of our officers overheard him . " <p> The young reporter says nothing at first . Then , " So did Marx , I believe . " <p> " Is that a joke ? " <p> " Only an observation . " <p> To the north the heavy guns finally fall silent . The legs of the commissar 's chair creak , the lamplight flickers on the letters spread across the table . It was only a week ago , the young reporter thinks , that the commissar trailed his hand in the river ; now that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , sighing , " good night , comrade . " <p> " Good night . " <p> It is a mild , moonless summer evening . Fires flicker in the yards of the cottages spread along the road , and in the weedy lots between cottages , and in the withered , water-starved fields . Near one campfire a phonograph plays-the schoolmaster 's phonograph , warbling under stars . <p> That night he dreams of Petrograd . It is winter . Across the black Neva , anchored into the cloudy , snow-dusted ice , stretch even lines of track , but there are no clattering trams out today . He is older , years older , and yet the city is as it was when he was twenty , before the revolution . In the flat upstairs , a rich , deeply resonant voice , muffled by lathe and plaster , is reciting a poem to thunderous music : By the White Sea we cast our nets into the cold blue waters and found a wondrous wonder , a most confounding wonder . A boot . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In my searches I have met with mishap , my most cherished dream did not come true . " <p> The murmur of a plane draws him to another window . A parade is passing ; hundreds of marchers fill the street , carrying sagging banners , carrying signs . Leaflets flutter down over the marchers from the ashy sky like enormous snowflakes , but the plane dropping them is nowhere to be seen ; there is only the low tractor-like drone of its engine . On the bobbing signs , framed in gold like the holy icons of older parades , is the broad black silhouette of a face . A single drum , somewhere deep in the crowd , beats like a heavy , slowing heartbeat . <p> Opening the window , he leans out across the icy sill to snatch one of the leaflets as it drifts by . <p> Comrades ! We have watched friends , brothers , husbands and wives-even our own children-march silently to their deaths , soldiers all in our great , glorious struggle . Everything we ever cherished , we have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades , history we were serving . But rejoice ! Now , at last , when we have nothing more to give , when we can go no further , it is history that is dying , and we may rest . <p> Somewhere among his papers , he knows , these very same lines are written . They are his own words , words he will return to after the last of the marchers has vanished and he is alone again . The leaflet is heavy in his hand ; it is still damp from printing , he sees , and the ink that bleeds onto his fingertips is as black as the Neva . Someone has begun to knock on his front door , someone is calling his name . Over Petrograd , like a ghost , the droning plane circles and circles . <p> This evening , over tea , the division commander and commissar discuss the Party 's policy of summarily executing political enemies , as it was established in the early , uncertain months of the revolution . As policy , it is a practice both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is . Instead their argument balances upon when such methods are to be carried out . " As often as is useful , " the division commander grunts , crunching the hard lump of sugar in his mouth . <p> " Yes , but useful to whom ? " asks the commissar . " After all , we do n't want to end up like the Jacobins , up to our stirrups in blood . We must be better than the French . " <p> " Dialectics and smoke . " The division commander rubs his eyes . " This is war , comrade commissar . In war one must follow orders , without debate . If I am ordered by my superiors to shoot some fellow-even if I personally have nothing against this man-then I will shoot him without hesitation . " <p> " And his wife ? His children ? " <p> " Yes . And you , too , comrade , " the division commander says gravely , setting down his cup and standing . He is a tall , florid , sorrowful-looking man . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you writing ? " <p> " Notes , " the young reporter says . <p> " For what ? " <p> " I 'm not sure yet . Perhaps you might let me interview you . " <p> " It would be good for morale , " the commissar suggests . " Our men need heroes . " <p> " Our men need boots , " the division commander says . It is a constant grievance with him : the poor supply lines , the lack of reliable boots and rifles and ammunition . " Put that in your article . " <p> The young reporter has long been drawn to men like this division commander . It is a weakness , he recognizes in himself , this fascination with power . What was it Gorky once told him ? " You have a particular talent for making dangerous friends . " Certainly this division commander is dangerous enough , though no friend . The young reporter has heard the rumors about him , some of them quite fantastic : that he was a priest before the revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read in the crumbling trenches at Tannenberg between German artillery attacks by a Marxist who somehow saw in him the ruthless commander he would one day become ; that he is the dishonored son of a general who once loyally served the now-dead tsar . The only thing known for certain is that nothing about him is truly known ; home , childhood , family-all of it is kept locked away , or has been excised altogether . Instead he has rendered himself in the revolution 's merciless image , and it has made him what he is : its sword . On his left hand , where the thumb and forefinger meet , is a little white scar in the shape of a bird as drawn by a child , all wings and no head . From firing a pistol , the division commander once told the young reporter . <p> " The man is completely without tact , " the commissar later complains . They are in the kitchen with the cook 's lazy-eyed helper , in a sprawling white farmhouse . It is raining outside , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vodka sits on the cutting block , and as the blowing rain rattles against the windows , the young reporter empties his glass and reaches for it . <p> " Tact or no tact , he 's an excellent soldier . " <p> " Of course . " The commissar hesitates . <p> " But ? " <p> " All this complaining about supplies and reinforcements . It reflects poorly on his superiors , and inevitably on the Party . A man in his position , with his potential- " The commissar lowers his voice . " He should know better . If he is to get along-politically , I mean , if he is to advance in the Party-he should know when to be quiet and simply let matters lie . " <p> " Like you . " <p> " No , " the commissar says . " I let my opinions get away from me . You heard me back there . I 'm as bad as he is . But then I do n't have his authority . I 'm more a standard bearer than anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Like you . " <p> Lulled by the drumming rain , the cook 's helper drowses on his feet ; his boots , the young reporter notices , are falling apart . Perhaps he is dreaming of bright , well-stocked commissaries full of sturdy boots no amount of walking will ever wear out : the endless , simple harvest of riches the young reporter promised in his first article , which the cook 's helper will parrot to him from time to time . It is a vision the cook 's helper has succumbed to without question . In this way the young reporter envies him sometimes . He would also like to believe unquestioningly in that endless harvest . <p> But this cook 's helper , he doubts nothing . Asked what role he intends to occupy in the new Soviet Russia , he will answer without hesitation : aviator . An absurd wish . He can barely light a stove by himself and yet he dreams of flying planes . " Tell me , what exactly does an aviator do , comrade ? " some joker will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aviator 's duty to educate the peasant , to show the peasant that there are no angels or devils hiding in the clouds . " This , the cook 's helper insists , is essentially all aviators do , as he was himself enlightened that first bright August after the revolution by a Bolshevik pilot who flew him up over his tiny village outside Smolensk , high over the scalloped mud streets and steep-roofed huts ; over the heaps of moldering trash and ugly , dark animal pens ; over his barefooted neighbors out flailing wheat in the fields beside the canal where , as a boy , he watched his mother and aunts slowly , grimly hauling barges every autumn , every spring , their arms held down at their sides by great heavy straps that stretched behind them like history itself ; over the only world he had ever known but had never before seen so clearly , into a sky suddenly emptied of devils and angels . <p> For three nights , while they await supplies in the white farmhouse , the column takes fire . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactic , almost comical : a handful of Polish irregulars with hunting rifles shooting wildly from the woods some two hundred meters away . As soon as their fire is returned , the Poles vanish , like ghosts . On the third night , when a stray bullet strikes the wall beside the division commander 's head as he stands studying his maps , the joke sours . At dawn , as the young reporter sleeps , the Cossacks ride out . <p> When they return hours later , they are herding half a dozen bloody , dazed-looking Poles before them through the high grass . This , the young reporter discovers , is all that remains of their attackers ; the rest-some twenty men-lie scattered among the trees where they were cut down . " You should have come , scribbler , " K calls happily . The gold caps on his teeth gleam fiercely , he is less circus gypsy now than grinning demon . At the edge of the field the Poles are made to strip down to their underwear-jackets , trousers , boots : the Cossacks fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon new orders arrive : they are to keep moving , the supplies will be sent by train to R- , a week 's march away . Roped together , barefooted , the Poles are told to keep up with the column or be shot . <p> " We are not your enemy , " the commissar tells them . In his earnestness he has jumped down from the wagon to walk with the prisoners , who turn their faces from him . " This marshal of yours , this lying pig Pilsudski , he is your enemy , not Russia . It is for your good as well , our being here . We are brothers . " <p> Brothers , the young reporter thinks . And the dead Poles sprawled in those woods back there-are they , too , his brothers ? The reins dangle across his knees ; the horses know enough to follow the wagon ahead of them , he thinks : let them lead us to Warsaw . Behind him , ablaze in the day 's last fiery light , the cook 's helper stands among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning the empty sky . <p> On the morning they are to advance on R- , as the division commander confers with his subordinates under the wide branches of a plum tree , planning their assault , a car drives out . From the wagon the young reporter and commissar watch the car 's long tail of dust rise and spread over the dying fields . <p> " It seems we 've been expected , " the commissar murmurs . <p> And they have . A dignitary , an old man in a green velvet vest and coat , steps smartly from the back of the dusty sedan and presents the division commander with an official letter of surrender , signed by the town 's selectmen . " Anything you require , " the old man says , " anything at all . We are at your service . " <p> " And your army ? " asks the division commander . <p> " Fled . " The old man 's voice cracks . He gazes up at the plum tree , holding up a shaky hand to shade his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming . Is n't that so ? " he asks his driver , turning . <p> " Like rabbits , " the driver says . <p> In R- they discover a town all but untouched by the war . There are elderly couples out walking spaniels , young women carrying babies and groceries and bunches of flowers tied with twine . Children on their way home from school pause to watch the column pass , their arms laden with books . Every corner has its teahouse , its tobacconist , every shelf is crowded with cakes and pickled herring , bolts of soft linen , boots . In the bustling open-air market , in the very heart of R- , overflowing baskets of plums stand tilted toward the busy street like an invitation . <p> Near a park they stop . The old man bounds up the iron steps of a mansion . A maid stands at the open door , waiting . She is young , beautiful ; her dark eyes gleam . She bows to them . <p> " Whose house is this ? " the young reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " And where is he ? " <p> " Who knows ? Gone . With the rest of the trash . Anyway , he was an idiot , " the old man admits sadly . Their footsteps echo , a soldier shouts joyously in the street outside , as if the war were already ended . The old man is opening one door after another , ushering the division staff from room to room ; it is his way of showing them the house has no secrets . " You see ? " he is saying . " Beautiful , yes ? " As they linger in the parlor among the leather sofas and cutcrystal lamps , the maid appears , carrying a gleaming tray of cordials , and when they have emptied their glasses , there is brandy , there is spiced vodka , there is wine . A vision overtakes the young reporter : they are like those gaping peasants in Petrograd who wandered in stunned silence through the Winter Palace after the tsar and his doomed family fled , eager to touch everything ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need , anything they have ever wanted or wished for , it is all at their fingertips . It is all theirs for the taking . <p> The prisoners are kept in the gated courtyard behind the new headquarters , in a garden shed . At night , while the division commander 's raucous staff dines at the mayor 's table , the Poles huddle among flower pots and sacks of fertilizer , quiet as stones . As they show no interest in escaping , they are allowed to move freely about the courtyard during the day and even write letters to their families , which the commissar collects regularly but does not send off . After the war , after the capital has fallen and there are no more secrets to protect , he promises the young reporter , he will give these men back their letters so they can return to their fami lies with some record of their experience . In this way their wives and children will one day learn of the kindness with which they were treated by their captors , and the revolution will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young reporter . <p> One day the cook 's helper asks the young reporter , " When are we going to see something new from you ? " They are handing the prisoners their evening ration : a slice of coarse black bread , a slice of onion . <p> " Soon , " the young reporter tells him . <p> All week now he has watched these Poles accept their meager portion of black bread and onion without complaint , and all week , every day , he has at odd moments found himself remembering his dream of Petrograd : the unseen circling airplane , the falling pamphlets , the parade of banners along the black , ice-locked Neva . With his notebook and pencil , he spends his afternoons exploring R- , scratching notes that have become , without his realizing it , a kind of journal . He is saving all of it : the vibrant , noisy market , the teahouses with their bright awnings , the well-stocked shops . Is this the heaven of simple riches he was imagining when he wrote that article for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , drunk on the mayor 's dry champagne , he stumbles out to the garden shed . Behind him the mansion blazes with lamps , with music-another party is in full swing . One of the panes of glass set in the shed door is partially broken out , and as he leans heavily against the locked door , trying to peer inside , the mayor 's mansion trembles in the crescent of glass like a palace of light in a fairy tale . <p> " Brothers , " he calls softly . " I 've not forgotten you . See ? " He pushes the piece of glass out and slips the half-empty champagne bottle through the hole , as a gift , an offering . " For you , " he says . The little garden shed breathes its sharp black odor of turned earth and fertilizer into his face , his hand hangs in darkness . A grave , he suddenly thinks . I am reaching into a grave . <p> Later , after the party has broken up , he finds the cook 's helper passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is it ? " the cook 's helper mumbles thickly ; his lazy left eye , unmoored , drifts past the young reporter 's face . <p> " Why is it so important that you become an aviator ? " asks the young reporter . " Are n't you happy ? Is n't being a cook 's helper enough ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Listen to me , " the young reporter says . " You think I know anything ? What if you never get to fly airplanes ? What if I was wrong ? What if I was lying ? About everything . " <p> " You 're were n't lying . " <p> " How can you be so sure ? " <p> The cook 's helper blinks . " I trust you , " he says , and rolls over . <p> They are ordered west again , back into the war . " You look disappointed , " the commissar tells the young reporter . They are the last to leave the mayor 's mansion , which after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly managed hotel : the furniture is in shambles , the crystal lamps shattered . The dark-eyed maid , whom the young reporter has several times caught sneaking drinks for herself , whom he has watched slip away with K one night and another soldier the next , bows as they pass her in the hallway by the front door , but there is something slightly corrupt in the gesture now . <p> " Do I ? " asks the young reporter . <p> Four days west of R- , as the young reporter sits drowsing on the wagon bench , the Poles finally attack . Terrified , the cook 's helper whips the horses mercilessly , shouting , trying to turn them around even as K and the other Cossacks fly past with their drawn swords flashing , straight at the Polish machine guns . The bleached sky rattles and snaps like sheet metal in a storm , the fields leap up in black fountains around them . <p> " They 've dug in , " the division commander announces that night , drawing his hand across the map . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have rolled over them in a matter of hours . " <p> " And now ? " asks the young reporter . <p> " Now- " The division commander does not look up . The white , bird-shaped scar on his outspread hand is luminous ; the young reporter 's gaze follows it across the map . " We begin paying for ground . " <p> Late the next morning , with his notebook and pencil , the young reporter creeps through the woods with the cook 's helper . They are going to the front . The cook 's helper carries half a dozen canteens slung round his shoulders ; all morning he has been tirelessly bringing the soldiers their water this way . As he and the young reporter are crossing a small clearing , a shell bursts high in the treetops to their left , showering the grass with shrapnel , knocking them both flat . It all happens so fast that the young reporter is on his feet again and running before he even realizes it . He discovers he is alone . Retracing his steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk of a pine tree beside the clearing , in a pool of flickering sunlight . " I tripped , " the cook 's helper slurs . The back of his head is wet ; the shoulders of his coarse tunic , into which the leather straps of the heavy canteens bite , is soaked through , sodden with blood . Groaning , the young reporter hauls him to his feet and starts back toward camp . <p> " You forgot me . " <p> The cook 's helper is smiling sleepily , as if at some secret joke . <p> " Just at first , " the young reporter says . <p> In no time at all they are lost . The young reporter is gasping , he has forgotten the way back . In the distance , as they stand resting by a rotting log they have passed twice already , they hear a whistle sounding the assault . " We have to leave the canteens , " he tells the cook 's helper . " I can barely carry you as it is . I 'll come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't forget ? " <p> " No , " says the young reporter , " I wo n't forget . " <p> Headquarters is a country unto itself . Twice already they have had to abandon the rotting farmhouse they now occupy in order to avoid being overrun by the Poles , who themselves were forced to flee the farmhouse only yesterday . There are papers scattered in every room : requisition receipts , postcards , unfinished letters in Polish , in Russian . You and our daughters are in my prayers and in my dreams . I embrace you . At night the walls leak wind , the sagging roof gapes , the young reporter can see the stars winking through as he lies sleepless in his little corner , among soldiers . In the other room the division commander paces before his maps , dictating orders in a low growl no one else dares talk above , so that when his staff speaks they speak in whispers . All their easy hopes for a quick return home have evaporated . There are rumors of impending counterattack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , walls are going up . England , it is reported , is sending guns and advisors by the trainload into White-occupied Russia . Kerensky plots an invasion from his exile in Paris , while their leaders in Moscow bicker and conspire among themselves for power . In Berlin , Rosa Luxemburg weeps as she is dragged from the opulent lobby of the hotel Eden to a waiting car , only to be later dredged from Landwehr Canal like some moldering relic from a scuttled ship . History has abandoned them . <p> " No devils , " the cook 's helper tells the young reporter . They are in the barn behind the rotting farmhouse , among the wounded , the dying . After days of drifting in and out of consciousness , the cook 's helper has begun to hallucinate . Smolensk , the wheat falling before the whistling flail , the groaning barge straps tight around his mother . " I looked , " he murmurs , and for a moment his wandering weak eye ceases its roaming , for a moment it finds the young reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing up there . " The smell of smoke carries across the farmyard . The dreaming horses stir uneasily in their stalls . A barn swallow darts among the darkening rafters overhead as night comes on , building its nest . <p> A week later they are sent back to R- : the young reporter , the commissar , K. They have outrun their communication lines , and are under orders to requisition more telegraph wire . The Polish front has collapsed , the victorious column continues its march west , gathering prisoners as it goes . Repeatedly the commissar must pull the wagon off the road in order to allow by reinforcements from Kiev : Cossacks , black-booted commissars , machine gunners sprawled atop tachankas in the merciless sun . " Good luck , children ! " K calls from the back of the wagon , waving a bottle . He has been drunk for days , ever since his beautiful horse was shot out from under him . Without his horse he is useless . In the distance a loose funnel of crows rises and swirls over the desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demands their papers . <p> " Who 're you ? " asks K. <p> The young officer 's hand rests on his pistol . " Cheka . " <p> He has the face of an angel . They wait as their orders are checked , their names recorded . The blazing sun beats down . The crows circle . Waiting , the young reporter finds himself remembering his dream of Petrograd . He stands at the window , watching the leaflets flutter down . Everything we ever cherished , we have given . But rejoice ! Soon , he thinks , the hidden plane will reveal itself , the door will shudder on its hinges . He will hear his name shouted , he will hear them calling for him . Babel ! <p> " Keep moving , " the young officer says , handing back their orders . <p> It is dark when they finally reach R- .

The bright shops beckon , the packed teahouses have opened their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings over the market , where the baskets will always be full . They are on a wide , level street lined , it seems , with nothing but churches . More than anything , the young reporter would like to stop and rest , if only for a moment , if only long enough to forget the war for a little while . But already the wagon is lurching forward . <p> " Wake up , child , " K whispers in his ear , shaking him . " We 've arrived . " <p>
