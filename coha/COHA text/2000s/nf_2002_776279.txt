Lessons on Learning // What I have come to believe about learner-centered teaching grew out of a serendipitous confluence of events and experiences . I will highlight three of the most important , roughly in the order in which they occurred , although all three overlap and are so intertwined that a stream-of-consciousness recounting would more accurately reflect the nonorder of their occurrence . // In 1994 , after almost fifteen years of working in faculty development , disseminating educational materials , a variety of administrative assignments , and teaching the occasional upper-division and graduate courses , I returned to the classroom to teach entry-level required courses to beginning students . It was a sort of a midlife career move . As I took stock in midcareer , I realized that the most important and personally satisfying work I had done , the work with the greatest chance of making a difference , was work I completed in the classroom . I decided to return , finishing out my career as it had started , by teaching undergraduates. // At that time , I was motivated not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . Students had changed , and much more was known about their learning needs . As I thought about the beginning communication course I was to teach , it seemed to me that what prevented students from doing well was a lack of confidence . They needed to find their way past self-doubt , awkwardness , and the fear of failure to a place where they could ask a question in class , make a contribution in a group , and speak coherently in front of peers . It came to me that I might address the problem by making the students feel more in control . Would it help if I presented them with some choices and let them make some of the decisions about their learning ? // That first semester back , I tried this approach . I designed a beginning public speaking course that had only one required assignment : students had to give one speech . The rest of the syllabus presented a cafeteria of assignment options : a learning log , group projects of various sorts , credit for participation and the analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being interviewed or both , and conventional multiple-choice exams . Each assignment had a designated point value and evaluation criteria . Students could opt for as many or as few assignments as they wished , given the course grade they desired . Each assignment had a due date , and once past , that assignment could not be completed . // Initially , students were totally confused . I remember arguing with one about whether the exams were required . Here is how the conversation went : // " They must be required , " the student insisted . " If the test is optional , no one will take it . " // " Sure they will , " I replied . " Students need points to pass the class . " // " But what if I do n't take it ? " // " Fine . Do other assignments , and get your points that way . " // " But what do I do on exam day ? " // " Do n't come to class if you are n't taking the exam . " // Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and virtually everyone wanted some sort of approval once they finally decided . // But what happened the rest of that first semester took my breath away . I had no attendance policy , but better attendance than in any class I could remember . More ( not all , but most ) students started to work hard early in the course , and some students determinedly announced that they would do every assignment if that was what it took to get enough points for an A. I was stunned by how willing they were to work , and with no complaints . Less concrete but no less real was the change in atmosphere and energy in the class . These students were committed to the class ; they appeared genuinely interested in the content . They asked more questions , sustained discussion longer , and in the end disagreed with me and other students far more than I remembered my former beginning students doing . It was not instructional nirvana , but it was a decided improvement , and I was motivated to continue refining this approach . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to review a manuscript under contract with Jossey-Bass and subsequently published as Becoming a Critically Reflective Teacher ( Brookfield , 1995 ) . Few other publications I read before or since have so dramatically influenced my pedagogical thinking . The book took me in two different directions . ( I describe the second later in this chapter when I get to the third major event that motivated me to write this book. ) // Through Brookfield 's book , I discovered how much about teaching can be learned by and through critical reflective practice . Brookfield describes methods that allow one to take a common instructional practice and through a process of analysis see the assumptions about teachers , students , and learning embedded in that particular practice . It was as if someone had held a mirror up to my teaching . In that reflection , I saw a different , and not very flattering , instructional image : an authoritarian , controlling teacher who directed the action , often totally unaware of and blissfully oblivious to the impact of those policies , practices , and behaviors on student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . I came to realize that the classroom environment I created ended up being a place where I could succeed and do well . Student learning just happened , an assumed outcome of instructional action that featured me. // Before reading Brookfield 's book , I had redesigned my course ; afterward , I attempted to redesign the teacher . Getting the course reshaped turned out to be much easier than fixing my very teacher-centered instruction . Flachmann ( 1994 , p. 2 ) captures exactly how I felt then and now : // I 'm a little embarrassed to tell you that I used to want credit for having all the intelligent insights in my classroom . I worked hard to learn these facts .... I secretly wanted my students to look at me with reverence . I now believe that the opposite effect should occur-that the oracle , the locus and ownership of knowledge , should reside in each student and our principal goal as teachers must be to help our students discover the most important and enduring answers to life 's problems within themselves . Only then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach them p. 2. // A second event strongly influenced my thinking about learning and ultimately became another reason for writing this book . For years , my husband , Michael , aspired to build a wooden boat . He collected books , bought plans , subscribed to Wooden Boat magazine , and faithfully watched " Classic Boat " on Speed Vision ( a cable TV channel devoted to racing ) . Then we bought property on an island , and it was time to build the wooden boat . We planned to build a house on the island and needed a boat big enough to haul supplies to the site . Armed with a set of blueprints ( selected after having reviewed hundreds ) , he started on the hull . First , it was the frame and battens . His vocabulary changed ; he talked of chines , sheer clamps , the kellson , and garboard . Then it was covering the hull with marine plywood , not something easily obtained in land-locked central Pennsylvania . The whole neighborhood showed up to help turn the hull . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor . At every step , there was a whole new set of tasks to learn . In our video collection , we have several tapes demonstrating fiber-glassing techniques . We still get catalogues from more marine supply companies than I ever imagined existed . // From nothing but hours of work and an unwavering confidence that he could figure out what he needed to know emerged Noah 's Lark , a twenty-four-foot , lobster-style , wooden boat . She has a sleek white hull and dashing yellow stripe and a beautifully finished ash cabin , and she 's powered by a fully rebuilt but not terribly fuel-efficient Merc Cruiser . She sits gracefully in the water , rises to a stylish plane , and cuts steady and stable through whitecaps and waves . She reliably tows barge loads of micro lam beams , bags of concrete , and sheets of plywood . Dockside , Noah 's Lark turns heads . The bold inquire , " Where did you get that boat ? " " Built her , " my husband replies , unable to hide the pride in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a wooden boat than I had imagined . But after dealing with those realities , what amazed me most was the confidence my husband brought to the task . Where did it come from ? On what was it based ? He had never built a boat before-houses yes , furniture yes , but not a boat . As the bills kept coming in , I felt it financially prudent to keep asking , " Do you know what you 're doing ? Is this really going to turn out ? " His answer was always the same , " No , I do n't know what I 'm doing , but I 'm learning . Of course , it will turn out . We need a boat , do n't we ? " // At some level , I was really asking myself if I would tackle a project this complicated , this expensive , and this time-consuming if I knew as little as he did about it . And at another level , I knew the answer : I would not . Furthermore , I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor I had faith that we could figure out this or many other complicated learning tasks that came to mind once I started thinking about them . // There was an irony here that stuck in my craw : Michael 's confidence as a learner did not come from his experience of obtaining a degree in industrial engineering . In fact , quite the opposite had occurred . He graduated from college feeling that he had just squeaked by , keenly disappointed with what he had learned , and stressed by the conditions under which he was expected to learn it . He credits experiences with his father for developing his confidence . It irritated me that rather than reinforcing his confidence , his college experience had undermined it . // College should be the time when and the place where students develop prowess as learners . I started thinking about what kind of college experiences would result in learning skills as sophisticated and confidence as heart-felt as his . I came to accept that one of my tasks as a teacher was developing lifelong learning skills and the confidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classroom environment would accomplish that ? How would those kinds of learning experiences be evaluated ? // Having accepted that goal , I saw course content in a whole new light . It moved from being the end to being the means . It went from being something I covered to something I used to develop learning skills and an awareness of learning processes . I saw evaluation as something much more meaningful than the mechanism whereby grades are generated . It become a potent venue for promoting learning and developing self- and peer assessment skills . // Although both of these experiences were instrumental in my early and continuing development as a learner-centered teacher , they are by no means the only events of consequence . Across the years and lessons learned , I have been informed , inspired , provoked , and encouraged by the occasional article and book , most of them personally reflective , that describe the attempts of others to move teaching to a different and more learner-centered place . My favorites are in the reading lists in Appendix C. If you learn more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , I recommend that reading list . // The Literature on Learning // In addition to these firsthand experiences , there was a third significant force in my development as a learner-centered teacher . Brookfield 's book took me in two directions . In addition to introducing me to critical reflective practice , it was the starting point for a lengthy and still not completed trip around and through the literature on learning . After reviewing that manuscript , I realized how little I knew of and about learning , and so I started reading some of the radical and critical pedagogy referenced in that book , which led me to work on constructivism . Next , I got into self-directed learning and from there into the work in cognitive and educational psychology on deep and surface learning , motivation , perceived control , help-seeking behavior , and a host of other topics . Somewhere along the way , I explored feminist scholarship on pedagogy . I could not believe the trove of literature on learning that exists . // Before I knew it , I was imagining summarizing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it with clarity . Then I would extrapolate instructional implications from the findings , finally closing the gap between theory and practice . Had I been twenty years younger , I can see myself pursuing this noble and needed objective . But being older and wiser , I saw the folly of trying to corral a literature this vast . Understanding even a bit about the nature of this literature makes it obvious why that task is not easily accomplished . Three features in particular show how difficult it is to summarize what we know about learning . // First , the literature is vast . Interest in learning may be recent , but the study of it is not . It spans decades , starting in modern times with the work of Dewey . It crosses disciplines with work being done in education and various subfields like educational psychology , higher education , and adult education . Other relevant work is underway in women 's studies and psychology . Still more work has been completed in fields with content totally unrelated to learning , like engineering and math . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on active learning , group work and inquiry-based approaches , the writing across the curriculum movement , and multicultural curricular reforms . Besides occurring across the decades and in multiple disciplinary contexts , the research and theory on learning is literally being completed around the world . It is a body of literature that would take a lifetime to read and another one to summarize and integrate . // Second , add to the vastness of the literature on learning the fact that this body of knowledge remains largely unassembled . It resembles a giant jigsaw puzzle that has a whole community working on it . A few sections are more or less finished . Collections of related but not yet connected pieces lie close together in other sections . And there are still a lot of individual pieces , definitely part of the puzzle but currently just spread out on the table . I do not mean to convey the impression that what is known about learning exists in some exceptional state of disarray . Like all other puzzles , this one comes with the picture on the box : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what is still not known about how it all fits together could be said of the state of knowledge in many other fields . //
