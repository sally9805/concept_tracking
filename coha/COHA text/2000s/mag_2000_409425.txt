// We put a lot of thought into the quality of the foods we buy and the recipes we prepare , but how much thinking goes into how healthy our kitchen is ? How pure is the water we drink and cook with ? Is the air healthy when we stir-fry ? Does our kitchen lend itself to recycling ? Will the materials in our new cabinets disturb a chemically sensitive family member ? Are we using our appliances in the most energy-efficient way-because there is also the health of our planet to consider . Ideally , you answer these questions when you build or remodel your kitchen . But that 's not always possible . This special Healthy Kitchen guide , the first installment of a new quarterly series , is designed to give tips both for people interested in making basic lowcost ( or no-cost ) modifications to their existing kitchens as well as those renovating their kitchens or building from scratch . You can improve the health of your kitchen with simple changes , such as using cloth napkins instead of paper , replacing incandescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carafe . Each of these makes a difference either to our health or that of our environment-or both- and you 'll usually save money in the process . It works the same on a larger scale , such as installing an exhaust fan or replacing an old refrigerator with a new , efficient model , which can save literally a ton of carbon dioxide emissions per year and several hundred dollars in electric bills . Can you imagine a bigger bargain than improving the environment and your family 's health and saving money at the same time ? TAMING THE ENERGY HOG These easy tips will make your refrigerator run more efficiently . Photograph // * Position refrigerator away from hot appliances and out of direct sunlight ( if possible ) . * Improve cooling efficiency and reduce potential allergens by dusting or vacuuming condenser coils every few months . * Clean out and sanitize drip pan on selfdefrosting models several times a year ( or more often ) . * Refrigerators work hard to get rid of moisture-give the condenser a break by covering refrigerated foods tightly . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly to avoid bacterial growth . Example : place a pot of soup in the sink with ice water and stir to lower the temperature faster . * Check temperatures occasionally ; maintain freezer at 0 to 5degF and fresh food compartment at 34 to 38degF . Colder temperatures increase energy usage ; warmer temperatures are unsafe for food . * Keep freezer about half full for maximum efficiency ( freeze cartons of water to make up the difference ) . * 1lose fridge and freezer doors right after removing food . You can retrieve food from the freezer quickly if you label each package and stash similar items together . Likewise , keep related refrigerated items together ( and teach this habit to your kids when they are young ! ) . * If a new refrigerator is in the stars , check its tag ( officially called the EnergyGuide ) for information on energy usage . Appliances that are especially efficient and boast smart design details can earn an Energy Star rating , which may earn you a rebate from your utility company ( check www.energystar.gov or call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 13 percent more energy than models with the freezer on the top or bottom , and ice and water dispensers require a good chunk of energy to operate . DOING THE DISHES Dishwashers are actually better at cleaning your dishes safely than most handwashing techniques . The water is hotter , the spray is harder , and air-drying is sanitary . Washing a full load of dishes by hand can consume more hot water than washing the same load in a dishwasher ( using less hot water is one of the best ways to save energy use and money ) . * When you use a dishwasher , save energy dollars by limiting prerinsing ; only wash full loads and air-dry dishes . * When you do dishes manually , wash a batch in a pan of hot , soapy water , then turn on the water to rinse . Change the wash water frequently , use a clean sponge , and let the dishes air-dry or dry only with a clean dish towel-never the towel you use to wipe up spills or dry your hands on . * Replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating a sponge in the microwave or dishwasher will not sterilize it ) . Do n't use the same sponge to clean up spills and wash dishes . Try to mop up countertop spills with a paper or cloth towel . Do n't store sponges and other cleaning tools in a tilt-down drawer in front of the sink . Sponges can mildew in such a closed environment . * Buying a new dishwasher ? A new model will clean a load of dishes better than your old one and should use less water too . Many new dishwashers have built-in booster water heaters and energy-saving cycles . You may need to choose between water savings and quiet operation , as not all models are both quiet and extra-efficient . HOME ON THE RANGE As a rule , electrical cooktops and ranges cost less to buy but more to operate . Gas cooktops offer more flexibility and quicker response than electric , but they give off combustion by-products that should be vented . Electric ovens boast steadier temperatures than gas . Look for the best of both worlds : a combination-fuel model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooktop and wall oven models , especially if there are several cooks in the kitchen . Convection ovens cook foods faster and more evenly than conventional ovens , but not all foods benefit from the drier heat of convection ; a combination convection/radiant oven might be your best bet . If you add a warming oven , be sure it can hold foods at no less than 140'F ; keeping food at lower temperatures for more than an hour will encourage the growth of bacteria and make a late dinner unsafe to eat . HEALTHY COOKING TIPS * If your kitchen has no fan , open the window when you cook , and cover pots when you can to keep steam from escaping . * Match pot sizes to the cooktop ( e.g. , large pots with large burners ) and turn off burners just before food is done . * If your gas flame burns yellow or orange rather than blue , it 's not burning efficiently-and is giving off more combustion by-products than it should . Have the gas company adjust it . * Do n't use the cooktop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few potatoes or heating up a cup of soup , use the toaster oven or microwave . * In microwave cooking , do n't let plasticespecially plastic wrap-touch food when it 's cooking , as harmful chemicals may leach into the hot food . * Since a crockpot uses very little energy , it 's perfect for making soups and stews. * Replace aerosol cooking spray with a pump sprayer for oil . * Thoroughly wash utensils and containers used for raw eggs in hot soapy water before using them for cooked food . * Wash even prewashed lettuce and vegetables in several changes of plain water before eating raw . * Use cutting boards for raw foods rather than countertops ; they 're much easier to keep clean and wo n't dull knives or scar the countertop . CABINET CONCERNS If you are renovating or building from scratch , here 's your chance to design a kitchen that will be more comfortable for anyone allergic to dust or mold . Thanks to improved insulation , windows and building practices , houses are " tighter " today . But with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that outgas-one of the biggest offenders in the war against toxicity . Outgassing comes from volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) , which are given off by certain chemicals found in many paints , solvents , adhesives , household cleaners and joint compounds . For the healthiest kitchen , choose materials that outgas least and that require minimal upkeep with toxic cleaners or finishes . The prime culprit of outgassing in cabinetry is formaldehyde . You can smell it right away in a new building . Most manufactured cabinets do not contain solid wood but rather are made of panel products that are bonded together with formaldehydebased glues . Still , it 's possible to minimize the effects of outgassing from formaldehyde : * You can paint the exposed surfaces of panel products ( e.g. , the undersides of plasticlaminate countertops ; the backs of cabinets ) with special coatings to reduce outgassing . Or you can cover the inside of a panelproduct cabinet with aluminum foil . * It 's best to avoid formaldehyde in the first place by using all-metal or all-plastic cabinets . Or seek out the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned finishes , such as pure linseed oil and beeswax . They 're not as durable as solvent-based finishes and need to be reapplied more often . * 1o improve the cleanliness of your cabinets , install doors on all of them and extend them to the ceiling . Eliminate open shelves that require dusting . And consider installing a central vacuum system that collects all dust , mold , and debris in a container outside the living area . COUNTER INTELLIGENCE A wide variety of materials is now available to suit every taste and budget . * PLASTIC-LAMINATE countertops ( aka Formica ) are made up of a thin plastic layer glued to a 1-inch-thick substrate . Substrate can be plywood , medium-density fiberboard or particleboard , all of which commonly contain urea-formaldehyde glues . It 's possible to seal the exposed substrate with a special coating . Or seek out a substrate with no formaldehyde , such as Medite. * STONE wo n't outgas , but it is porous ; even the hardest , shiniest granite can be stained by acids and oils . If you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reapply sealants periodically . Ask your builder to use a water-based penetrating sealer rather than a solvent-based one . Finishes are purported to be inert once they cure , but if the surface is scratched , the stone will again be vulnerable to absorbing food . * SOLID-SURFACE countertops are made of the same material all the way through . They 're also nonporous , do n't outgas and are easy to repair with sandpaper . But solid surface countertops are expensive and based in part on petroleum products . * CONCRETE is also a " green " countertop material and wo n't outgas once it is cured . Consider having a countertop precast rather than cast in place , which is a messy process and you might be disturbed by the resultant by-products . Concrete is porous , so plan on sealing it periodically with a solvent- or water-based sealer. * WOOD makes a beautiful countertop that does n't require VOC-based sealer , but it is porous , just rub on mineral oil once a month or apply beeswax as recommended by the cabinetmaker . As with concrete , wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less porous and hence more hygienic than end-grained butcher block , which has the traditional checkerboard look . * TILE is nonporous and waterproof and would make a great countertop if it were n't for all those grout lines , which require seating to keep clean and mildew-free . Be aware that some imported tiles contain lead and other toxic minerals in the glaze . A better use is as a waterproof , heat-proof backsplash. * STAINLESS STEEL is the most hygienic countertop available , which is why it 's used in restaurant kitchens . It 's also impervious to heat and water and can be recycled . FLOORING IT Forget about carpet , even low pile . Carpet harbors dust mites , mold and bacteria , and the backings can outgas for ages . Here are the latest in flooring options . * The most hygienic surfaces are concrete , stone and tile , but none is particularly easy on your feet . Vinyl is inexpensive and easy on the feet , but it can outgas and harbor mold in the joints in hot climates. * Two old-timers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both are durable , cushy and relatively easy to clean . The best part is they are beautiful and are made from sustainable materials : cork from tree bark and linoleum from linseed oil , pine resins , jute , cork and other wood pulp . * Wood floors are quite popular today , but be aware that they are n't always solid wood . The new " floating " wood floor is made up of a thin layer of wood bonded to a substrate that contains formaldehyde. * Salvaged wood flooring is a big business for those who love a country took , and since it is really recycled , it may be your only guilt-free source for a wide-board floor . * A new comer is bamboo , which is beautiful , hard and knot-free . As anyone who has ever grown it knows , it is a vitally renewable resource . For a more waterresistant , durable finish , three or more ( more is better for durability ) coats of water-based polyurethane will cure faster and outgas less than oil-based . WATER If the taste and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to filter it . There are many potential contaminants in tap water , whether it 's from a public supply or a well . To reduce contaminants that come from the pipes , run the water for a few minutes in the morning or after you 've been away for a few days . And do n't use hot water from the tap for drinking or cooking ( unless you 've got an instant-hot water tap ) . * The simplest method of filtering water is to purchase a carafe ( about half-gallon capacity ) with a replaceable carbon filter . It 's important to change the filter according to the manufacturer 's recommendations , since it can harbor bacteria if left too long . * Another reasonably inexpensive and easy fix is to install a faucet-mounted device , which also requires changing an internal carbon filter periodically . * A more expensive route is to install a whole-house system or a point-of-use system under the kitchen sink . These systems may incorporate several filtering methods , including carbon filtering , reverse-osmosis or distillation . Each method filters out certain contaminants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carafes , faucet-mounted filters ) usually remove lead and chlorine , but that may not be sufficient if you are concerned about arsenic or parasites . For more info , contact NSF International ( 8001 NSF-MARK ; www.nsf.org ) , a nonprofit organization that certifies filters according to the contaminants they remove . AIR It 's hard to track down all the sources of indoor air pollution , but your kitchen is a good place to start . Combustion by-products from cooking with gas can pollute the air , as can too much humidity and grease from cooking on any stovetop . These by-products should ideally be removed from the kitchen by a fan that is ducted to the outdoors . Equally guilty are harsh cleaning chemicals , pesticides , outgassing from building materials and , ironically , air fresheners ( which coat mucus membranes with an odor-disguising chemical ) . * Downdraft vents , which fit into the cooktop , are n't as efficient as range hoods ( remember : heat rises ) , but they can be sufficient for most cooking . High-energy professional-style cooktops require range hoods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking odors. * You 'll save money and energy if the cooktop is on a perimeter wall so that the duct run for the range hood is short and straight . LIGHT A bright kitchen is more than a bright idea ; it makes cooking easier and whether natural or artificial has a huge influence on mood . * Instead of installing wall , to-wall cabinets , put in windows wherever possible . * To enhance the light , position windows close to solid , light-colored surfaces , such as ceilings or countertops . Sunlight or reflected light can bounce off the adjacent surface to add diffused light to the kitchen . * Provide cross-ventilation if possible . * The best windows for moderate climates have insulating glass ( i.e. , at least two layers of glass with insulating gas between them ) . The best insulating glass is Low-E ( low-emissivity ) , which reflects solar heat away from your house in the summer and reflects indoor heat back into the kitchen in the winter . They may cost more than standard insulating glass , but you 'll break even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Task lighting , a high priority , can be supplied by compact fluorescent or halogen fixtures affixed to the underside of wall cabinets . Make sure wall or ceiling fixtures actually shine directly on the countertop. * Fluorescent bulbs can last up to 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs , while using a quarter of the energy and producing 90 percent less heat . Today 's compact fluorescent fixtures have warmer , more natural tints than their ghastly green ancestors . * Halogen lights are more energy efficient than regular incandescent bulbs and truer in color to natural tight .
