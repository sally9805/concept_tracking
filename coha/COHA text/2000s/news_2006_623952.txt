<p> The Security Analysts of San Francisco invited a noted bear , Richard Bernstein of Merrill Lynch , and a prominent bull , Ed Yardeni of Oak Associates , to forecast the markets at a dinner for members Thursday night . <p> Bernstein , Merrill 's chief U.S. strategist , predicted that the return on domestic stocks will be just 1 percent this year , which could be beaten easily by cash instruments such as Treasury bills or money market funds . <p> " Returns on capital are highest where capital is scare , " Bernstein says . That 's why the Mafia can charge exorbitant interest rates to people who ca n't borrow money anywhere else . <p> Today , " no asset class in the world is starved for capital , " he says . " We think every asset class will perform in a muted fashion . " <p> Bernstein says he has n't been bullish , or optimistic , about U.S. stocks since mid-1998 . But he does n't relish the title of bear . <p> " It 's not that we are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . <p> Everybody else includes Yardeni , who says he has been a bull " almost throughout my entire career , " which he attributes to his " happy childhood . " <p> Yardeni , who worked for Prudential and Deutsche Bank before joining Oak as chief investment strategist in September 2004 , predicts the Standard &; Poor 's 500 will finish the year at 1,400 , which would give it a 12 percent gain for 2006 . <p> Yardeni serves up movie reviews with his economic predictions ( see **27;6142;TOOLONG ) . He liked the Johnny Cash biopic " Walk the Line " but panned Woody 's Allen 's tennis-themed " Match Point " ( a bad line call in my opinion ) . <p> Yardeni and Bernstein did agree on one thing : The Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising short-term interest rates longer than many people expect . <p> Wall Street popped the champagne early this month when the Fed released minutes from the December meeting of its open market committee , which sets interest rates . <p> The minutes said the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 4.25 percent in December was unanimous , but " views differed " on how many more increases will be necessary , and the number required " would probably would not be large . " <p> Many pundits read that to mean the Fed might raise rates once more to 4.5 percent at its January meeting ( which will be Chairman Alan Greenspan 's last ) and then stop . <p> That interpretation set off a stock market rally , which has abated somewhat in the wake of higher oil prices and some earnings disappointments . <p> The December minutes " are irrelevant , " Bernstein says . " People have confused the end of Greenspan 's term with the end of the ( interest-rate ) cycle . " <p> Since the December meeting , gold , housing stocks and other investments that tend to go up with inflation have all taken off , which means inflation is hardly tamed , says Bernstein . To keep it in check , the Fed will have to continue raising rates . <p> Yardeni agrees that the Fed is not done . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenspan ) , I want to get federal funds as high as possible without causing a recession , " he says . <p> He says that when the next recession does hit , core inflation is likely to be low , just 1 to 1.5 percent , and deflation fears will resurface . At that point , the higher the federal funds rate , the more room the Fed will have to cut it to stimulate the economy . <p> Yardeni predicts the Fed 's open market committee will increase the rate by a quarter-point each in January , March and May , bringing it to 5 percent , before stopping . " I 'm not in the ' one and done ' camp , " he says . <p> How can Yardeni and Bernstein have similar interest-rate outlooks but such different stock market predictions ? <p> Yardeni says the Fed will continue raising rates because economic growth will remain strong , averaging 3.5 to 4 percent in the first half of the year . That will be good for stocks . <p> Yardeni sees many similarities between the 1990s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a modest recession triggered by a severe downturn in major industries , " savings and loans in the 1990s , and technology and telecom early this decade . <p> Both times , the Fed responded by lowering rates dramatically and both times , " there was skepticism expressed about whether lower rates would get us out of the recession . " <p> " In 1993 and 1993 , commodity prices started moving higher , a sign that the Fed 's monetary policy was starting to work , " he says . In 2003 and 2004 , commodity prices started rising amid a global economic boom . <p> In 1994 , the Fed started raising interest rates to head off inflationary pressures . In 2004 , it did the same thing . <p> " Both times , despite fears of inflation picking up , it remained remarkably subdued , " he says . <p> " The Fed stopped raising rates in 1995 and I think they will do so again in 2006 , " Yardeni says . <p> The second half of the 1990s ushered in a stock market mania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of this decade . He points out that stocks were cheaper in the first half of the 1990s than they are now . <p> " There is potential for irrational exuberance , but it does n't have to be in the U.S. stock market . We 've seen a lot of exuberance in foreign markets , " he says . <p> " Commodity and energy prices are much higher now than then and could stay higher , creating a windfall for emerging economies with natural resources . A lot of people are putting that money into local stock markets , " he says . <p> " It could end badly , " he adds , but probably not before the Chinese Olympics in September 2008 . <p> Bernstein , on the other hand , worries that if the Fed raises rates too high , it could create a profits recession . He notes that short-term interest rates are on the verge of topping long-term rates , a condition known as an inverted yield curve . He says that every yield curve inversion has been followed , if not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stocks are not cheap relative to earnings and falling earnings would cause stocks to fall . Compounding the problem  --  earnings are , increasingly , suspect . <p> " The quality of earnings is the poorest in my career , " Bernstein says . <p> Companies must report their earnings using generally accepted accounting principles . The chief executive and chief financial officers must certify that their earnings statements are accurate and complete in all material respects . <p> But in press releases and conference calls with analysts , companies create new , usually higher earnings numbers that ignore all kinds of expenses they deem one-time or not germane . <p> If companies use these hypothetical or " pro-forma " numbers in press releases , they must show how they differ from GAAP numbers . But the pro-forma numbers do n't have to be audited or certified by the CEO or CFO . <p> Unfortunately , stocks trade off of pro-forma numbers , not GAAP numbers , says Bernstein . If a company is overstating its earnings , its stock will be inflated . <p> In a recent study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard &; Poor 's were overstating their earnings by 10 to 15 percent . <p> Highly rated companies , on the other hand , were understating their earnings by 5 percent . Their stocks went nowhere last year , and the companies may have low-balled 2005 earnings so their gains in 2006 look bigger , Bernstein speculates . <p> This is a " major issue , " he says . " We have been very critical of the SEC for letting this go on . " <p> Because there are no values in any market , Bernstein says investors should be widely diversified in 2006 . Because of the earnings quality problem , they should stick with higher-quality companies . <p> Bernstein predicts that utility stocks will outperform the market this year . His analysts predict that utilities will be the third-fastest-growing sector in the S &P; 500 , after technology and consumer discretionary stocks . <p> He likes utilities more than those two sectors because utilities are still " underowned " by institutional investors , even after a big run-up last year . <p> Yardeni , meanwhile , says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector last year , will be No. 1 again this year . <p> Bernstein " picked utilities last year and I picked energy , " says Yardeni . " Energy was No. 1 last year and utilities was No. 2 . <p> We 're both sticking with them . Maybe we 'll both be wrong or right . " Ed Yardeni predicts the S &P; 500 will finish the year at 1,400. / Newton Don
