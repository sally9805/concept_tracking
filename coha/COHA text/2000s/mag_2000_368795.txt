We crab and crouch in the brush , low to the ground in the woods of Michigan . Deep , deep in the woods . Patient , silent , dressed as trees , we stalk our prey . Not the mighty bear or the trophy buck but an animal far more dangerous , and dumber than a bucket of rocks . The poacher . <P> A white pickup skids to a halt , the driver spotting a white-tailed doe and a buck in the brush off Sucker Creek Road in Alcona County . The deer are on private property , so if this hacker grabs his rifle and takes a shot , he 's under arrest . Bob Mills , my partner , radios to our backups , Sergeant Pete Malette and Officer Warren MacNeill , who are hiding in a nearby grove . " We 've got a looker , " Mills tells them . <P> The driver is backing up slowly , so as not to scare the deer away before he can get a clear shot . What he does n't know , the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're robodeer . Yes . Robotic deer . Who can compete with American ingenuity ? Malette just had a funeral for a buck that took so many bullets in the line of duty  --  more than 100 in seven years  --  they called him Sluggo . <P> All across the country , conservation officers use mechanical Bambis , most of them made by a Wisconsin taxidermist , to nab poachers . The deer do n't gallop through the woods or eat prize rhododendrons . Only their heads and tails move . But that 's all it takes . " You ca n't believe the look on a guy 's face , " Malette says , when a brawny hunter discovers he has just blown holes in a stuffed animal with AA batteries in its head . <P> Mills gives me a cue to flick the two joysticks that make my deer 's head swivel and her tail twitch from 50 yds. away . This would be easier if not for the camouflage hat the officers gave me . With a curtain of dangling burlap strips , it looks like Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be spinning around like something out of The Exorcist for all I know . I ca n't see through the dreadlocks . The driver may not know whether to lock and load or call a priest . But he 's still watching . Go ahead , tough guy . Show some courage . <P> Some poachers have argued entrapment , but Malette knows of no one who 's got off on that defense , because the typical charge is trespassing , carrying a loaded weapon or shooting out of season , which can cost up to $500 in fines and 90 days in the brig . And he 's come across some real All-Stars . The Hemingway wannabe who wet his pants when he got caught . The jughead who was nabbed twice in one day . Malette uses a wild-turkey decoy too , and had one cowboy go after it with a .357 Magnum . We 're talking N.R.A . Dream Team . But the all-time champ was the Lions Club president who asked Malette to bring a decoy to their meeting . " They were laughing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot at this thing ? ' " Three days later Malette had the decoy on a stakeout . Guy drives up , gets out with his rifle and blasts away . The Lions Club president .
