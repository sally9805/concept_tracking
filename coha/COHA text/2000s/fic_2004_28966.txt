1 No morphine : no use , the doctor said . The boy would die within the hour , and morphine was in short supply . He was saving it for the soldiers -- for American soldiers , he added , checking the wall clock , then his watch , then me . It was four o'clock , 1600 hours Alaskan War Time , on July 6 , 1945 , a mere thirty-four days before fighting in Japan officially ended . The boy was Japanese . When I was a boy , I was told a writer should date his age from the day he started writing . I ca n't remember why I was told this ; I just remember that I liked it enough to repeat it over the years to those who might benefit from the wisdom . To anyone . To people like my drill sergeant . He had a quick reply : a soldier should date his age from the day he started killing . If that 's so , I was even younger than the world took me for back then . An eighteen-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , waging a secret war , from Alaska , for six . I 'd trained in bomb disposal . I 'd learned to speak some Yup'ik , I 'd fallen in love with a woman who talked with touch , I 'd shot a bar glass out of my captain 's hand . And now , in that tiny room , in a mission infirmary just inland from the Bering Sea , the weather cool and wet , I was sitting at the side of a boy who was dying . I was AWOL . And for the first time since putting on a uniform , I was crying . At eleven , the boy died . At midnight , I turned three days old . I 'M A WANTED MAN . That 's hardly enough to distinguish me around here , of course . I 've heard it said that a percentage of Alaska 's population is always fleeingsomething -- the authorities , spouses , children , civilization . By comparison , I have it easy . It 's just a couple of old priests hunting me , and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that , and it wo n't . I 'll be honest up front . They 're coming after me for the most mundane of reasons . The only thing slightly extraordinary is that they 're coming at all . For a while , I thought they would just forget about me , and that I 'd be able to live out my days like most fugitives here : not entirely free from want , but free from those who want you . But no , first one sent a letter and then the other : these initial letters just suggestions , of course . Then a second round , with a request . And the third round , with an order . Come home . Now , I served in the army . I know what it means to disobey an order , even a bishop 's , and yet I did . Let them come . They say they will . This Friday , two days from today . My superiors ( the bishop himself , they 'd have me believe , and his right-hand man ) are flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bush to haul me in for the crime of -- believe it or not -- growing old . Apparently you ca n't be seventy-three and live in southwestern Alaska , though this fact seems lost on a good portion of the population here in Bethel . But no , it 's been decided . It 's time I came in , returned stateside , or , as those here say , Outside . When I 've asked what I 'm to do in retirement , they 've said , Rest , write -- almost sixty years in the bush , what stories you must have ! A younger man will replace me , I 'm told , but who are they kidding ? Silver-haired fiftysomethings count as young priests these days . And the fact is , fifty may be too old -- if the silverhair being moved here is from , say , Phoenix . Me , I grew into this environment . I came during the war , left for seminary , and returned to stay . I 've had fifty-six years to get acclimated , and the hardest part of that acclimation came when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf-tanned , fifty-year-old suburban priest who will survive transplantation here -- I do n't care how carefully he parcels out his multivitamins . There is a bit of mystery to their pursuing me . There 's another Catholic missionary I know who lives up north on the banks of the Yukon , in much rougher conditions than the relatively civilized frontier life here in Bethel ( which includes electricity , a hospital , even alcohol -- though only by mail ) . This Yukon priest , he 's eighty . Maybe ninety . No one 's coming for him . And his parishioners do n't even like him , at least not as much as mine do me . It 's why I did n't answer any of the letters I received . One , I 've aged into a fine contrarian , but more important , I wanted these men to come tell me face-to-face that I needed to retire . That way , when they said , It 's because you 're getting old , I could study their eyes and see what the other reason , the real reason , is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man I killed , or the boy I did n't save . It 's not even about the woman I loved . But the shaman -- Well . Yes . This all might have something to do with him . THE LOWER PART of Ronnie 's leg was not torn off by wolves , though that 's what he tells most people . And if someone got to see it , which almost no one ever does , that person might come away thinking he was telling the truth . His right leg ends just above the ankle in a tight red scar , the exact size , shape , and color of angrily pursed lips . The skin around it , smoother than silk from all the creams and ointments medical staff insist he use , colors with the weather and hosts storms of its own : clouds of bruises -- red , blue , and purple -- gather , encircling the stump , spreading , growing darker , and then fading . The amputation is relatively new , the prosthesis even newer , and learning to walk again has been a battle for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs and jokes to curses and grunts and perspiration and Ronnie begging , Please , please take it off , let the swollen stump pulse and breathe as it wants to -- well , a person wanted those wolves . He wanted them . I wanted them , pacing , their fiery eyes sizing him up , but at least looking him in the eye , not like the diabetes that was truly to blame . By some accounts , I should be glad that Ronnie -- just installed in his room , at the end of the ward , with windows looking west -- is ill ; for years , he had been trying to kill me . Nothing special , just a shaman trying to roust a priest . But shortly after arriving in the hospice , diabetes flaring and pneumonia threatening , he summoned me to his bedside . Plans had changed , he said . He was no longer seeking my death . And to prove his sincerity , he gave me the talisman that he 'd planned to use to speed my demise . It resembled a voodoo doll , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : short and starting to stoop , gray hair , something like glasses . He had dressed me in my blacks , although I rarely wore or wear clerical garb out here in the bush . Such clothes are n't warm enough for winter , too scratchy for summer . Besides , people knew well enough that I was the local Catholic priest . Ronnie knew ; that 's why he wanted to kill me : my God and I had driven his people and powers away . We had had this argument for decades , ever since I came to this part of Alaska to replace the previous priest , who had disappeared ( some said literally , said they watched him fade away , limb by limb , until all that was left was a mouth in an O of horror , until there was nothing ) . Ronnie liked to suggest that he had something to do with this disappearance . He was , then as now , the local shaman , a bit green for the role at the time , but few sought the job ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronnie himself was n't a great advertisement . Whatever his success had been with my predecessor ( whom my superiors suspected had simply fled , hysterical , out into the tundra one winter night -- we 'd lost more than one man that way ) , Ronnie 's efforts with or against me went unrewarded . Charms were tacked to my door ; various sacrifices filleted and placed about my corrugated tin chapel ; and , of course , much scheming and chanting and brow furrowing was done out of sight . All to no avail . And for an interloper , I was , and am , innocuous enough . Better yet : I have had a positive effect . We missionaries all tell ourselves that , but I have , I really have . With the help of modern medicine , I have healed the sick ; with the help of the bishop , fed the hungry ; with help of wealthy , faraway , misty-eyed parishes , clothed the poor . I have insisted on saying Mass , but I adjusted my schedule to meet theirs . What 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk their language , I 've played their games with their children . The previous man outlawed traditional dancing . I 've encouraged it and attempted to learn . And I 've blessed things . Babies , houses , holes in the ice . Dogs , and later , snowmachines . Outboard motors and cases of Crisco . Nets , knives , and sewing needles , yes ; but guns , never . And once , a dead woman 's stuffed parakeet , although that was more exorcism than blessing . Her widower had remarried ; the man 's new wife said the parakeet helped friends cheat her at cards . Saint Francis , I prayed , it 's not enough that this woman has to make a life in the subarctic tundra ? With a husband who keeps his first wife 's parakeet ? Peace , Saint Francis . Go easy , O Lord . And this hospice , Quyana House . It 's a curious , mostly empty place , located well outside of town . It blossomed on the grounds of an abandoned radar installation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned here one summer while serving as a missionary-in-training . THE HOSPICE IS OFTEN empty because it 's hard to get to , and people do n't quite trust this Outside generosity . ( Quyana means " thank you " in Yup'ik , which is all well and good , since this part of Alaska is Yup'ik Eskimo , but people find it a strange name nonetheless : just who is being thanked , and for what ? ) Plus , the old and terminally ill usually die at home -- or at the hospital in town . The hospital is known as the Yellow Submarine , but the way it snakes along the tundra , long and flat , its every corner rounded , it looks more like bars of soap smushed together , or maybe some Outside architect 's idea for a hospital on the moon . It stands on stilts ; just about everything in town does . Otherwise , buildings would melt the permafrost and slowly sink into the tundra . But the hospital 's awkward seventies Star Wars design makes its stilts look like landing gear ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in town who sometimes wish it would . The hospice , on the other hand , is a soaring structure , seemingly composed of equal parts glass and light . We all await the storm that will level it , but month after month it survives , and maybe I should n't be surprised : I 've blessed the place half a dozen times . First , when they cleared the land for construction ; second , when someone had fallen from some scaffolding and broken both legs ; third and fourth came when a new wing went up and when it collapsed ; fifth was the grand opening ; and sixth was the dedication of the wing where Ronnie now lies , ready to discuss the terms of our truce . I had put the doll replica of me in my breast pocket , taking care that the little arms and head were peeking out . At first , I did it as a joke , but then I had this sudden , inexplicable need to cough , and I thought : play it safe . I gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thinking of the word , the word that 's become a central tenet of my amalgamated Alaskan faith , a word that inevitably becomes part of any religion that spends too much time in the subzero subarctic dark : maybe . No one from Outside understands this law of the bush . No one understands how rock-solid principles can slide here ; how black-and-white so inexorably mists to gray ; how a priest , a true believer , a defender of the faith , a dealer in eternal truths , can find himself spooked by a makeshift voodoo doll . It ca n't happen . It 's not possible . You repeat this like a mantra , and then you get back to the word . Maybe . For Ronnie , God bless him ( if only either were interested ) , there is no maybe , only is . On those occasions when we do talk theology -- which is seldom , sadly , now that he 's more sober -- Ronnie always taunts me with his trump card : proof . Show me proof of your God , this Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Apostle Paul 's insistence to the Hebrews that faith is the evidence of things not seen . Ronnie finds this rather pat : his proof , he says , is in the stars , in the grains of snow blowing against the glass , in the salmon who return every year , in the Yup'ik people , who , despite everything , still walk the earth . All this is proof of spirits -- his spirits -- at work . Diabetes , on the other hand , is proof of my work . Not me personally , not even my God , but certainly my people , he says . And it 's true , junk food is replacing alcohol as the white man 's new smallpox , and though it takes longer to kill the native population , the unhealthy shift in diet from what the land provided to what air cargo provides -- Spam , Pop-Tarts , and worse -- still takes too many lives too early . Diabetes sent Ronnie to the hospital more than once , then trouble with his liver . For years , he drank too much , but as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lecture him on that . He 's been using the hospice for his health care of late . He likes it here ; it 's quiet , no one bothers him . But he bothers them , since they 're not really set up to deliver the care he needs , unless he gets really ill . He used to respond that if they kept it up , he would be that ill , and for a while , that seemed funny . But now he 's more sick , more often , and they just shrug and let him stay as long as he wants . I think he misses fighting with them . I miss it , too . In the past , we 'd talk and joke a bit whenever I visited him here . ( Or rather , I talk , and Ronnie shakes his head and rolls his eyes : I talk too much . ) Whenever he fell asleep , I would pray , as much a function of habit as anything else : when I first started visiting Ronnie back in the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would inevitably fall asleep . Eventually , it became a kind of ritual that soothed us both . I sat and prayed , he slept , and in this way , we visited .
