It was one of those days . Jason Manning scrubbed his hands in the stainless-steel sink , then applied ointment to several scratches . He 'd just finished examining and prescribing antibiotics for a feisty Persian cat with a bladder infection . The usually ill-mannered feline had never been his most cooperative patient , but today she 'd taken a particular dislike to Jason . <p> He left the examining room and was greeted by Stella , his receptionist , who steered him toward his office . She wore a suspiciously silly grin , as if to say " this should be interesting . " <p> " There 's a young lady who 'd like a few minutes with you , " was all the information she 'd give him . Her cryptic message did n't please him any more than the Persian 's blatant distaste for him had . <p> Curious , Jason moved into his book-lined office . " Hello , " he said in the friendliest voice he could muster . <p> " Hi . " A teenage girl who seemed vaguely familiar stood as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction as if he should recognize her . When it was obvious he did n't , she introduced herself . " I 'm Carrie Weston . " She paused , waiting expectantly . <p> " Hello , Carrie , " Jason said . He 'd seen her around , but for the life of him , could n't recall where . " How can I help you ? " <p> " You do n't remember me , do you ? " <p> " Ah no . " He could n't see any point in pretending . If a cat could outsmart him , he was fair game for a teenager . <p> " We 're neighbors . My mom and I live in the same apartment complex as you . " <p> He did his best to smile and nod as though he 'd immediately placed her , but he had n't . He racked his brain trying to recall which apartment was hers . Although he owned and managed the building , Jason did n't interact much with his tenants . He was careful to choose renters who cared about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rarely saw any of them other than to collect the rent , and even then most just slipped their checks under his door around the first of the month . <p> Carrie sat back down , her hands clenched tightly in her lap . " I  --  I 'm sorry to bother you , but I 've been trying to talk to you for some time , and and this seemed to be the only way I could do it without my mother finding out . " <p> " Your mother ? " <p> " Charlotte Weston . We live in 1-A . " <p> Jason nodded . The Westons had been in the apartment for more than a year . Other than when they 'd signed the rental agreement , Jason could n't recall speaking to either the mother or her daughter . <p> " Is there a problem ? " <p> " Not a problem exactly . " Carrie stood once again and opened her purse , taking out a thin wad of bills , which she leafed through and counted slowly . When she 'd finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , " she announced . <p> " Yes ? " Jason prompted . He did n't have a clue where this conversation was leading or how long it would take the girl to get there . Stella knew he had a terrier waiting , yet she 'd purposely routed him into his office . <p> " She needs a man , " Carrie said , squaring her shoulders . <p> " I beg your pardon ? " The girl had his attention now . <p> " My mother needs a man . I 'm here to offer you one hundred dollars if you 'll take her out on a date . You are single , are n't you ? " <p> " Yesbut " Jason was so surprised , he answered without thinking . Frankly , he did n't know whether to ask which of his brothers had put her up to this , or simply to laugh outright . He could n't very well claim he 'd never been propositioned before , but this was by far the most original instance he 'd encountered in thirty-odd years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " AhI 'm not sure what to tell you . " The girl was staring at him so candidly , so forthrightly , Jason realized within seconds it was no joke . <p> " I do n't think my mother 's happy . " <p> Jason leaned against the side of his oak desk and crossed his arms . " Why would you assume my taking her out will make a difference ? " <p> " I do n't know . I 'm just hoping . You see , my mom and dad got divorced when I was little . I do n't remember my dad , and apparently he does n't remember me , either , because I 've never heard from him . Mom does n't say much about what went wrong , but it must 've been bad because she never dates . I did n't care about that before , only now " <p> " Only now what ? " Jason asked when she hesitated . <br> Continues ...                   @ @
