One day I get tired of crying and feeling sorry for myself-I 'm not starving , I 'm not in a war , I 'm not crippled-and decide to track down my real father 's phone number . Is n't it about time ? I 'm practically thirty years old . This is my life , right now . <p> I call Cleveland information . I do n't know why I 'm surprised when they give me the number . Irving Brandwein , as present and accountable as Macy 's . I write it down on the corner of a takeout menu from Hunan Royal . <p> It 's the Fourth of July weekend , a few weeks before Prince Charles is supposed to marry the shy kindergarten teacher . Everyone-meaning my ex-boyfriend and some crazy girl he broke my heart for-has left the city two by two . When all that 's left is me and my carefully chosen pile of new books ( The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1 , The Interpretation of Dreams , Strangers on a Train ) , armature against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoosh of the occasional taxi , the Doobie Brothers coming from someone 's open window . The soundtrack to the end of the world . <p> I do n't know my father , not really . My mother divorced him when I was six , replaced him with a new father right away , then another one when that one turned out to be defective . The last time I saw him I was-what ? Twenty . He called to say that he was passing through New York for a sporting goods convention-that 's his business , sporting goods or sports clothes or maybe sports trophies , something like that - and could he take me to dinner . Very polite . The time before that I was ten , when he took me to lunch and asked me why I wanted to change my name . This was in Cleveland , where we lived . My mother took the same care dressing me as I took dressing my dolls . For lunch with my father : patent leather Mary Janes and my brown tweed Chesterfield coat with the velvet collar . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the car . ) I did n't have the heart to tell this almost stranger that Mother had changed our names , unofficially at least , the moment she remarried . " I just want my last name to be the same as my mother 's last name , " I said primly over chicken in a basket . My initial sense of importance-my younger brother , Alex , was n't included-had been worn down by my father 's soft , persistent questions with their alarming implications . I wanted to go home , to my biography of Abigail Adams and the new puppy our second father got us . <p> The last time my real father called , I asked if I could bring my best friend , Phoebe , along to dinner . As I said , I was twenty . Nothing that happened to me was real unless it happened to Phoebe , too . My father was shorter than I remembered . Phoebe and I sat beside each other on the banquette , smoking and drinking gin and tonics , telling what we had studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us scrupulously avoiding each other 's eyes for fear of collapsing into awful helpless laughter . The memory makes me cringe . " I 'll wait for you to call the next time , " my father told me kindly at the end of that evening . I guess it was n't a great strategy on his part . <p> A few days later , I get up the nerve to dial the Cleveland number . She answers the phone . His wife . I ask for him , for Irv . That 's how we refer to him , Alex and I. He 's the original one-name celebrity . " It 's Grace , " I say . " His daughter . " I feel like I 'm calling the President . <p> " It 's nice to hear your voice , " my real father says when he gets on . His voice has the gentleness I remember , a little bit shy . He definitely sounds surprised . We say a few formal things back and forth , but it does n't matter what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone to ring . I know the feeling . <p> The next thing you know , Irv and his wife are going to stop in New York for a day just to see us-me and my brother-on their way to a wedding in Florida . The first Saturday in August . They 'll arrive in the afternoon and spend the night . So there 's going to be a reunion : Me , Alex , Irv , and his wife . Not Mother . <p> " Have you told her yet ? " my brother says . He has zero memories of Irv-he was only three when they divorced-but he 's onboard with the reunion . " Because you know she 'll want to be in on it . " Nope , I have n't . I 've been relishing the secret . It 's like walking around town with a concealed weapon . <p> " This has to be about us , not her , " I say with big sisterly authority . It occurs to me , though . Telling would be like actually using the weapon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good luck , " he says . <p> I take the subway to my mother 's apartment on a Friday afternoon . We only have to stick around the office until noon in the summer . I work for a consulting firm that tracks novelty item and condiment trends . I write up reports for Howard and Josie , the two partners , put together focus groups , attend luncheons sponsored by Fez and the Pimento Council . Look , it 's not the job I 'm supposed to have . I ca n't even go into all the reasons I have it . <p> My mother and I sit on the terrace . She lives in an apartment house that takes up the whole block , but her apartment is on a low floor , and you can see directly across the street into a firehouse that 's been remade as a sculptor 's studio . What an excellent New York view . I feel sorry for the sculptor , though . All he gets to look at is my mother 's mammoth white brick building . <p> My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biscotti I picked up on the way . She 's perfectly dressed , in pale linen afternoon clothes . She looks like she 's just come from or is going somewhere . Where ? She does n't have a job , she does n't see a therapist , she does n't volunteer , and she has no hobbies . A mystery as usual . <p> " Grace , you know me . I only want this to be a good experience for you and your brother , " my mother says after I 've made my speech about who can participate in the reunion and who ca n't . <p> " Okay , well , good . " I sit up a little straighten I like this feeling-gently but firmly forbidding my mother to suck up all the available attention . <p> We each sip our tea . <p> " Although I 'd be curious to see Irv after all these years , " she says . " That 's natural , is n't it ? " <p> Who knows what 's natural ? I ask people to share their feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you discussed it with Dr. Gold ? " my mother says . <p> " What do you mean ? " She means , Did you tell her before you told me . <p> " Does she think this is a good idea for you right now ? " <p> " Why would n't it be a good idea ? " <p> Recently my mother called Dr. Gold and asked her what she should be doing to help me . She and Alex hover impatiently around my prickly unease like diners waiting for their table . " Be her mother , " Dr. Gold says she told her . I wish I had thought of that . <p> Instead of going downtown to my empty apartment , I let my mother persuade me to walk around the corner to a neighborhood boutique she likes . My mother chats it up with the saleswoman while I peel off my T-shirt and jeans and try on a bunch of stuff in the dressing room . I come out in a strapless cotton dress with a matching jacket and consider myself in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I feel like someone I might like to be ? I try to picture my father seeing me for the first time in ten years . A sophisticated young woman . Nice shoulders , curly hair . Sexy . My mother runs her hand thoughtfully across the back of the dress with a small frown . I know that touch . It 's code for stand up straight . I see what she sees : I 'm crooked . One shoulder is higher than the other . I have no idea what happened to make my spine curve that much and no more . I do n't even think about it . I 'm tilted in a certain direction , and that 's that . I adjust my shoulder . <p> " I love that on you ! " my mother says with a great big smile . <p> " And it 's transitional , " the saleswoman tells my mother . <p> I get the dress and some other stuff . My mother pays for everything while I pretend to be mesmerized by a scarf and jewelry display at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go to Bergdorf 's for shoes . I tell them to put it on my mother 's charge . I sign her name on the slip and write " Daughter " in parentheses . <p> The following week , Dr. Gold and I start out with the upcoming reunion and how I feel about it and what my fantasies are of what might happen . I feel good , kind of excited , I have no particular fantasies . " I just want him to know what kind of person I 've turned into , " I say . But what kind of person is that ? <p> I tell her about the shopping trip . Last winter Dr. Gold and I spent three sessions on whether or not I would accept a raccoon coat my mother no longer wore . Telling her about the new clothes is like confessing to some kind of junkie relapse . Just when I think I 'm about to finally understand the nature of my bargain with my mother , a fog fills my skull and settles around my brain like a fairy-tale spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my style , " I tell Dr. Gold . I sound combative . Is the spell her fault ? <p> " Well , how would you describe your style ? " she says . <p> " Less , I do n't know , structured . Looser . More flowy . " I get a picture in my mind of Joni Mitchell , then Virginia Woolf , then Julie Christie in Darling . Folkloric hippie ? Droopy thirties tea dresses ? Mod London ? A furious ball of misery and complaint has lodged itself in my throat . My eyes fill up . Why do n't I have a style ? Dr. Gold uncrosses and recrosses her legs . Now I worry that I 've inadvertently insulted her style . Not that she has a style . When I started seeing her at the clinic two years ago , she wore jean skirts and sandals . " I 'd prefer to see a man , " I told the director of the clinic when he asked if I had a preference . " No particular reason . " They gave me Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to go away in August . Now she wears silk blouses and tailored skirts and spends the entire month in Greece or Sardinia or Wellfleet . One of those places . It 's almost a relief when people go away . <p> I find a room for Irv and his wife in a hotel on Park Avenue South . A good weekend rate and equidistant from my brother 's apartment and from mine . <p> I call up my brother to tell him . <p> " I know that hotel . They shot a scene from The Verdict in the bar . Paul Newman slaps Charlotte Rampling across the face . " <p> " So do you think I should take it ? " I picture us all meeting in the dark woody bar after they 've had a chance to unpack and get settled . I hear myself telling Irv and his wife that a Paul Newman movie was filmed here . <p> " Do whatever you want , " my brother says . " This is all your idea . " <p> I have a few memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've combed through them with Dr. Gold : Irv giving me a stuffed monkey named Zippy , Irv hiding colored Easter eggs under the sofa cushions , Irv 's pale calves sticking out of a bathrobe . Mother was the one who 'd asked for the divorce . Why ? Unclear . She 's remarked that Irv could be " sarcastic , " that he was n't " ambitious , " that he was " a little too short on the dance floor . " She 's said that it was a long time ago . Do n't even try making someone remember something . It 's like telling someone who to love . Irv remarried right away , too . My brother and I used to make fun of his new wife 's name-Bettina . Wheatina , we called her . Peals of laughter . My mother laughed , too . We were big laughers . <p> " Who made that joke ? " I ask my brother during one of our planning conversations . <p> " Probably I did , " he says . " Why ? What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everyone is so touchy all of a sudden . Is there a law that says I have to find the same old jokes hilarious ? This one happens to strike me as mean . And why does my brother still have all the basic facts wrong ? He thinks Irv is from England . <p> " He 's not ? " <p> " He was there , during the war . But he 's not from there . They were Polish Jews . " <p> " Did n't he fly in that battle over Holland ? The A Bridge Too Far battle ? " We have a few photographs of Irv from World War II . There 's one of him in his lieutenant 's uniform . A bomber jacket and a cap . His face-his kind eyes , the shape of his mouth-is deeply familiar to me . " I thought Irv 's mother was English or something , " Alex says . He says it like he does n't care one way or the other . <p> " I think she lived in England for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm hazy on the details myself . " Irv 's parents-our grandparents-were socialists , " I say . I feel proud of this . <p> " I wish I had that leather jacket , " my brother says . <p> I imagine we 'll eat at a nice bistro in the West Village on Saturday night . Should I get theater tickets ? No , it wo n't be that kind of visit . We 're probably going to want to spend most of our time talking . <p> " If this is just going to be some superficial thing , if we 're not going to talk about why he left , then I do n't want to be part of it , " my brother says on the phone one evening . I 'm surprised by his sudden burst of feeling . <p> " What 's he so angry about ? " I ask Dr. Gold at our last session before her August break . " He thinks Irv wanted to leave . Where did he even get that idea ? " I do n't know why I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Gold does n't answer them . I talk some about work , about how the business is shaky and if it fails I 'll probably have to go on unemployment and if that happens how will I even be able to see her because if I do n't have a job where would I get the money ? After that there 's not that much to say . In the silence I can hear the clock ticking . The session is almost over . I wonder if we 'll hug . When Dr. Gold asks me how I feel about her going away , I say , " You , you , you . It 's all about you . " It 's not like I expect her to laugh . As far as I 'm concerned she 's already gone . <p> I met my ex-boyfriend-he 's a writer who does freelance stuff for us-through James . James is our office manager . <p> " So what 's his story ? " I asked James after spotting this cute guy in the office one afternoon . <p> James is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a large , pale head , doleful blue eyes , and thin hair the color of sand . The week I was hired , two years ago , a pipe burst in my office-we 're on the third floor of an East Thirties brownstone-and I had to share with James for a month . We got to know each other . I learned that his marriage , to an attorney for the health and hospitals union , was faltering but that he did n't know whether he wanted to save it or leave it . Like me , he loved Fred and Ginger movies and old popular songs . He collected vintage postcards and tropical fish and rolled his eyes at the temperamental business practices of our bosses . <p> The game was n't something James and I decided , exactly , just something we slipped into . We pretended that we worked for a company that made some nameless widgety product . James was Mr. Appleton , and I was Miss Hanford , the sexless boss and the spinster secretary . We were formal and repressed with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I moved back to my own office , Appleton Products stayed in business . <p> They 're like small vacations for me , the game days . I forget to be afraid . <p> Other days , James wanders into my office mid-afternoon , deposits himself in the chair opposite my desk , and tells me stories-about his mother who bakes pies and his father , a state trooper in Oregon . Or I tell him about my life , such as it is , and he tips back in his chair , hands resting on his belly , listening like there 's nowhere else he 'd rather be . I feel happy when I can make James smile his whale smile or shake silently with laughter . For minutes at a time I feel good . <p> " I do n't know . Good writer . Kind of an asshole , " James said . <p> He was good . I 'd read some of his real writing , in one of the men 's magazines . Sexy , too . Muscular and compact in tight black jeans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the dark hair above his wrist bones . Took me to a steak house on our first date . " You eat like a man , " he said approvingly . <p> I sensed another woman in the background from the get-go . Well , in the foreground , too . An almondy shampoo still owned air rights under his showerhead . A few items of clothing ( cute , my size ) were shoved to the back of his closet . His former wife . She worked for a United Nations agency whose name I could n't keep straight in my mind . He said she 'd left him for the Palestinian representative to Mozambique . <p> " Now what ? " I asked Phoebe . We were watching television together over the phone . <p> " Jeopardy . " <p> " No . I mean , now what ? " <p> " He 's going to dump you five seconds after he recovers from his divorce , " Phoebe said . " But wait-is he divorced ? " <p> " Well , yes and no-I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Turned out he was , but only in the letter-of-the-law sense . He confessed that crazy girls held a fatal charm for him . The girlfriend between the ex-wife and me had been a shoplifter . " And how will you describe me ? " I asked him once , pretending flirtation . " You ? " He pulled me close , and his hands wandered , sweetly tracing the shape of me . " You 're not crazy , " he whispered . " You 're curvy . " Curvy ! Curvy has its charms , but crazy is love 's Super Glue , the mousetrap that never lets go . <p> I 'm the type who gets unhinged after love ends . What 's saner than that ? One night I rang his bell after midnight just to demand a more thorough explanation . " This is n't a police state , Grace ! " he admonished . " It 's just dating . Dating ends . " It felt like a police state . " Do n't you even have false pride ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I did n't . Maybe I was crazy . " That 's good , " he said . " You only have real pride . " <p> " Well , Miss Hanford , I 'm glad to see you back at your desk , " James said when I returned to work three days later , all cried out . " You 're looking well . Your vacation must have agreed with you . " <p> " Thank you , Mr. Appleton . Mother and I always enjoy our yearly week together , " I said in my prim pretend voice . That 's another thing about crazy girls . They do n't have mothers . They create themselves . <p> The day of the reunion I wake up with butterflies in my stomach . Their plane is supposed to get in at noon . My brother and I do the LaGuardia to Manhattan arrival math a hundred times . <p> " He 'll call me when they get into the room , " I tell him again . " Then I 'll call you . Then we 'll meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I can meet outside , and we can go in together . " <p> I change clothes a bunch of times . In the end , I 'm wearing the new suit . <p> When the phone rings I think I might be sick . <p> Alex is pacing back and forth on the sidewalk in front of the hotel , smoking a cigarette , when my taxi pulls up . His face wears a pained , distracted look that gathers itself , briefly , into acknowledgment of my costume . " Different look for you , no ? " <p> I feign disinterest . " Father clothes , " I say . <p> " Well , you look nice . " He flicks the cigarette into the street . " Are you ready for this ? " My stomach flips . <p> The bar is pitch-dark after the glare of the afternoon , but I see them right away , at a table in the back . They 're on their feet the second they spot us . They look like tourists . Irv . Not too tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kind of fit and muscular , though , in a polo shirt . Is that a cigar in his hand ? I think I like it . Suddenly I 'm remembering a bowling alley-pins crashing and the smell of beer . <p> Okay , here we go . Lots of hellos and handshakes and awkward embraces . I 'm shocked by how related I feel to this man . The words form silently on my tongue : My father . Nice hug , and he 's just my size , with a pleasing dryness to his voice and again , that familiarity . Plus he 's regarding me and Alex with so much , I do n't know , pleasure , it seems he feels related to us , too . I feel proud of myself , like I 've just given birth . Bettina is beaming . <p> " What would you like ? " Irv says once we 've arranged ourselves at the table , me and Alex on one side , Irv and Bettina on the other . No false heartiness in Irv 's voice , thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody marys . <p> But if not false heartiness-what ? <p> Bettina fills in with , " You kids look exactly the same . " I smile and nod , still speechless as a fool . <p> " It 's wonderful , really wonderful , to see you both , " Irv says then , like a meeting finally called to order . <p> " Awfully long overdue , " I murmur . Am I at tea in an English novel ? <p> Alex says , " Now I know who to thank for my receding hairline , " and Irv smiles . <p> " Does n't that come from the mother 's side ? " I say , but luckily no one pays attention . <p> There 's a microsecond when the earth threatens to open and swallow us all ( only Bettina survives ) , but in the nick of time I remember to tell the Paul Newman story-he 's even from our hometown-and Irv looks around the bar again , impressed , retrieving from memory the exact scene in the movie which , we all agree , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical review and record-keeping : Alex accounts for college in Boston , then the two years he spent in South America , running a small leather company . That 's the official story , at least . I offer a funny anecdote about my job . I can do that . <p> " Did you know that your grandfather was an editor ? " Irv asks me . No , I did not . " He edited the Yiddish newspaper in Cleveland . " Hey . How about that . <p> Irv and Alex discuss the Red Sox and Indians ' pennant chances as if they 're picking up an old conversation . Bettina turns to me . " Is there someone special in your life , honey ? " <p> " No , not really , not right now , " I say . I 'm not interested in doing girl talk with Bettina . I 'm listening to Irv and Alex , remembering how our second father took us to behind-the-fence dinners at the stadium . I 'm reciting the names of the old players to myself-Minnie Minoso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem . I 'm studying the shape of Irv 's eyes , hearing the music behind his words and his habit of punctuating his stories with fond , teasing banter directed toward his wife . I 'm betting he tells war stories , the same ones again and again , and that everyone listens with real affection even though they 've heard them all before . I 'm thinking , He reminds me of someone , and then I 'm realizing that it 's me . <p> " His all-time favorite book is Fear Strikes Out , " I say , indicating my brother . <p> After that everything quiets down . We all let it . <p> " You know , I was n't completely sure I wanted to come here , " Irv says . His hands levitate a few inches above the table , hover , then lower again . <p> My face wears an expression that says , Go on with that . <p> " I did n't know if I wanted to risk it . If it 's not going to lead to anything more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking : Lead ? Lead to what ? " I guess we have to start somewhere , " I say . " Like , just to get some leverage . " Whatever that means . The problem with spending most of your time inside books is you can produce words for any occasion . You just do n't necessarily know what you 're talking about . <p> " I have no real memories of you , " Alex says abruptly . " I just know that you left . I did n't know why then , and I do n't really know why now . " <p> It occurs to me that our second father might have upended the table in response to my brother 's challenging tone of voice . That father had a temper . We neighborhood kids used to put on plays in the backyard every summer . I was always the lead and the second lead-princess , queen , fairy godmother . I 'd deign to give my brother a minor role-dwarf , palace guard , woodsman . The summer we did Sleeping Beauty ( I played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing Kenny Baum , the King , behind our garage when Alex walked to the center of the lawn and delivered his one line : " There must be a path somewhere through this forest . " Our next-door neighbor , Tommy Lantano , whose job was opening and closing the curtain , a blanket draped over the clothesline strung between our two garages , said , " Shut up , Alex , " and I burst out laughing . Next thing you know Daddy has me by the arm and is hauling me into the house-for laughing or kissing , I 'm still not sure . <p> " Well , the short answer is , that 's the way your mother wanted it , " Irv says . He says it in a resigned way , without a trace of anger . <p> " Are you sure you kids do n't want something to eat ? " Bettina says . Bettina is n't resigned . <p> My brother does n't remember the day we were adopted by our second father , but I do . We 're sitting on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge 's office . This would have been sometime after the day Irv took me to lunch . We 're quiet , my brother and me , not even joking . I can feel my scratchy slip under my dress . Someone shows us into the judge 's office . He 's sitting behind a desk deep as a football field and piled with papers . ( Was he wearing a black robe or have I added that ? ) We already know he 's going to ask us which father we want . Even at ten , I know that this is only the pretend question . It 's our mother we 're being asked to choose . <p> The judge asks me first : Do I want our stepfather to be our real father from now on ? <p> My mother is n't in that room with us , but my mother can see me no matter where I am . She can see all the way through me , everything good and everything bad . I 've hidden my questions in a place so remote even I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . <p> Then it 's my brother 's turn . When the judge asks him , he says grumpily , " Why do we have to choose ? " <p> " But you could have fought harder to be in our lives , " Alex says now . " You never did . " <p> " Well , your mother made it pretty difficult , " Irv says slowly as if it pains him to say it . " I 'd take you out to dinner , and your mother would turn up in the same restaurant . Or I 'd come to the house to pick you up for the weekend , and she 'd say that Alex could n't come-he was being punished . " I try to picture this : My mother and our second father lurking sitcom style in plain sight . I can even see the challenging hat my mother is wearing . I glance at Alex , who looks frankly skeptical . " But I suppose the real reason is that I did n't think you two wanted me in your lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

By us ? <p> " Well , we were just children , " I hear myself say in my most queenly voice . " I mean , that 's what we were . " My head is pounding with the wrongness of it . There 's a whole new slant being introduced here . We rejected him . I 'm not sure there 's room in this reunion for that particular slant . <p> " It was a very big loss for your father , " Bettina says . " It was a tragedy . He loved you kids very much . " I understand something about Bettina suddenly : She hates my mother . The knowledge sends a thrill through me . I 've never heard of anyone hating my mother . How dare she . <p> By the time the waiter comes around again we 've agreed that the meet and greet part of the reunion is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bettina in the lobby , repeating the instructions about the dinner reservation and getting to the restaurant , then Alex and I make our way out to the street , tightlipped , as if we 're in danger of being overheard . It 's overcast now , and humid , but the two of us stand at the curb , dazzled by the light , murmuring sounds at each other , the gist of which is , Do you believe this ? Is n't it unbelievable ? A taxi pulls up , we hug quickly goodbye , and Alex opens the cab door . I get in , and he leans in toward me . " I wonder what he thinks of my hands and my elbows , " he says . " I wonder what he thinks of the scar above my eye . " <p> It had been a few days before the Fourth of July , when my buzzer rang , startlingly , sometime after ten p.m. -a terrible sound . What had I done ? James 's voice came crackling over the intercom . Could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set foot in my apartment-we did n't socialize outside of work-and the fact of him standing there , his blurred , impassive face and mournful politeness among my things , my furniture and books and bed , made me shy and worried and , as a result , excessively flirtatious . <p> " It 's you ! I 'm so happy it 's you ! " I said . He was looking around dismally now , uncertain what he was doing there . " Should I get you a beer ? " <p> He sighed , a complicated soliloquy , and ventured farther in , and for a terrible moment I thought it was Mr. Appleton standing there in my apartment , and for a more terrible moment I thought it was n't . <p> " A beer would be welcome , " he said . " I just thought I needed some , uh , exercise . " With that he sank unhappily into the one easy chair . <p> " Ah . " I nodded and hurried to the refrigerator . <p> We drank those , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sofa , James planted in the chair . As my air conditioner rattled and heaved , we talked about the usual things . He did n't mention what had propelled him out of his own home , and I thought it intrusive to ask . Finally , when he appeared ready to leave-he was standing , not steadily , and I was making thanks-for-coming noises-we wrapped our arms around each other and stood for a moment that way , my head against his chest , breathing together , swaying slightly . He smelled altogether alien through his damp T-shirt . Kissing him was frightening and necessary . The kissing carried us to bed , and once there our heads cleared . Too late , or possibly too soon . Either way , our sympathy for each other was unable to transform itself into anything we could get lost in . He left long before morning , pulling his clothes on like a hurried apology . This I sensed rather than saw . I was afraid to open my eyes . <p> " Take care , Grace , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . <p> My phone is ringing as I unlock the door to my apartment . It 's Mother calling , wanting to know how it 's going . " It 's going good , " I say . <p> " Honey , I 'm so glad . I wanted this for the two of you . " <p> Whatever it is she means , I feel a rush of guilt . <p> " Mom , I 'm sorry about excluding you , but you understand , right ? " <p> " Of course I do . In fact , I spoke to Irv just a little while ago . He invited me to join you for dinner , but I think not . Although he suggested brunch tomorrow . " <p> " You called the hotel ? " <p> " Just to say hello . Grace , I hope you 're not angry . I could n't help myself . I had to know what he thought about the two of you . " I know that this is at least partly true . " I think he was happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hotel room , sitting on the edge of the bed , talking to my mother . I see the half smile on his face as he lets my mother 's warm voice wash over him . I see Bettina , stretched out next to him on top of the bedspread , her shoes kicked off , fuming . I know just how she feels . Still , my mother is the one I 'm rooting for . That 's just the way it is . <p> He 's a nice man , my father . He 's the nicest man my mother ever married . I know how the rest of the visit is going to play out . He 'll talk about the past . He 'll tell me things about my mother , things he does n't mean to tell and that I do n't really want to know , although somehow I already do . He 'll confide in me , wanting to know what he can do to disarm my brother 's anger and whether I think it can be disarmed . He 'll want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll inquire , delicately , if I think the divorce might have had anything to do with it . He 'll want me to know that he 's there for me , and he 'll ask me to promise to stay in touch and let him know , really let him know , if I ever need anything . We will keep in touch . We 'll exchange dutiful Sunday afternoon telephone calls and say " I love you " before we hang up . It 's too late to have a real father , but maybe it 's not too late to know I used to have one , once . <p> After the night with James , I had spent several mopey days believing myself to be in love with him , several more certain I was n't and was instead responsible for causing some serious harm . In the office , James appeared ambiguously jaunty , then stricken , treating me with an awful counterfeit casualness . Finally , I invited him out for a drink . " Why did you come over ? " I asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head . " I like you so much , Grace . " <p> " And now ? " <p> " I 'm married , and you do n't need that . God , it 's the last thing you need . " <p> I let his words , and then the kindness inside the words , seep into my blood and my bones . I said : " I hope I have n't behaved inappropriately with you , James , because I would n't want to do that , not with you-you , of all people ... " I trailed off . That rickety little speech was the best I could do . <p> On Friday morning , the start of the Labor Day weekend , Howard and Josie summon James and me into the conference room and tell us that business is bad right now , and the firm ca n't support a staff . They have to let us go . I knew it was coming ; I 've known it for months . But now that it 's happened I feel devastated . I start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled and embarrassed , but I ca n't stop . How will I survive not being tucked into this little house with my family of coworkers ? What will become of me ? <p> James and I each have a cardboard box to pack up the stuff in our offices . Mine holds a few jars of cornichons and fancy mustards , some dumb novelty pens and retro Pez dispensers , but mostly coffee mugs and office supplies . When I look up , James is standing in my doorway . He 's holding a white plastic crash helmet with the words " I Saw Haley 's Comet Coming " printed on it . It 's his favorite novelty crash helmet . He clears his throat ostentatiously . <p> " Miss Hanford , on behalf of Appleton Products I 'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for all your hard work and dedication , " he says . He uses the bottom of his T-shirt to wipe off a thin layer of dust , then offers the helmet to me . " I hope you 'll accept this small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the best gift anyone ever gave me-well , the most heartfelt . When I put it on my head I almost expect to hear the ocean . " Thank you , Mr. Appleton , " I say . " No matter where I go in life , I will always remember my time here at Appleton Products . " My words feel echoey as they bounce weirdly off the plastic , but I can tell that I 'm saying what I mean . <p> While I finish packing up , I remember James telling me something his father told him , about searching for people who are lost in the woods . The first thing the troopers want to know is whether the missing person is right- or left-handed . Apparently , people tend to get lost in the direction of their handedness . Everyone leans one way or the other . Someone who knows which way will always know how to find you . <p> Author Affiliation
