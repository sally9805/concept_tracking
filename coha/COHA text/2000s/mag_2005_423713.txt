It 's hefty enough so it wo n't defect in rough , hard snow , but still maneuverable enough for trees and tight spaces . GRIPES : With its large turn radius , it struggles to bang out quick turns . PROPS : Perfect all-mountain ski for the skier who spends a lot of time making arcs . TESTER 'S TAKE : " The Mag magnifies your carving power .

A beefy tail snaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girth , if not the heft , to handle most crud . GRIPES : Some tip deflection at speed in rougher crud . PROPS : Liveliest ride of the group and one of the hardest chargers on firm snow . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Serious tail ! Rips groomers wide open and surfs over anything .

Based on the Recon 's high marks from last season 's test , we chose it as a benchmark ski for rating this new group of fatter all-terrain skis . It epitomizes this subgroup : a wide-waisted ski with a pronounced sidecut for true on-and off-piste versatility . Ski it long for a more traditional and oaty feel , or go shorter to emphasize the 18-meter-radius carving muscle .

It has the top-end muscle of a World Cup GS racer and carves like it 's 68 mm underfoot , when it 's actually 78 . That extra girth lends true performance in powder and chop . GRIPES : A bit heavy for zippy arcs . PROPS : A virtually unlimited top end and unprecedented versatility . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Nothing will beat this space shuttle in a drag race .

GRIPES : We 'd love a bit more float in the crud . PROPS : Plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S TAKE : " Like the paddle shifters in a Formula 1 car , the Z9 lets you easily notch it up or down .

Its tight 17.6-m turn radius made it a pleasure on the groomers . GRIPES : Our power-poweroriented pros found the shovel short and a tad oriented floppy-feeling . PROPS : Easy to squirrel around in the trees . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Amazing contrast in size and agility  --  like working a 150-pound tarpon on 12-pound test . "  --  Megan McGrath 7 ) VOLKL : UNLIMITED AC4 $1065 ( WITH BINDING ) ; 125/82/110 ; 17.8 M POWER 58 FINESSE 42 SPEED 3.5 OFF-PISTE 3.2 CORDUROY 3.4 CARVE 44 FLOAT 56 You 'll be hard-pressed to find a ski as wide underfoot ( 82 mm ) and as versatile as the AC4 . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall-line turns . But it really shines when you 're heading for first-chair powder . Powerful hookup in the beginning of the turn and extra grip belie the girth . GRIPES : Favors powerful riders with the muscle to handle its energy . PROPS : Hard to believe a ski could carve and float this well , but it does .

FLAKE WHY DO MY TWIN TIPS LEAVE A ROOSTER TAIL ? Because ski engineers wanted an excuse to use the word contrail , which is ordinarily associated with jet planes . Traditional tails , you see , smother underski snow before it can form a contrail . But a turned-up tail channels the snow up along the curvature of the ski and spits it into the air so you can roost your buddies . Illustration SEVEN PHOTOS ILLUSTRATION // <p>
