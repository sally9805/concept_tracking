Like many other couch potatoes who take their quality TV time seriously , I hailed the arrival of TiVo as a liberator . Back in the dark ages of TV watching  --  about four years ago  --  there were two ways to catch your favorite shows . You could run your life on the networks ' schedule , or you could enter VCR-programming hell . Then came TiVo , a miraculous device that remembered what I liked and let me watch it whenever I wanted . But , as I soon learned , TiVo could be tyrannical . <P> The problem occurred when the machine ran out of room on its puny 30-gigabyte hard drive ( space enough for about 10 hours of TV at best quality ) . Loath to delete or miss anything TiVo had saved especially for me  --  who wants to disappoint a machine that has worked so hard ?  --  I lost a lot of sleep watching things I was n't quite in the mood for . Take the night I stayed up bleary-eyed through the three-hour Russian version of Solaris just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wing onto its NOW PLAYING list . There must , I knew , be a way to make TiVo work a little harder . <P> Luckily for me , there is a whole subculture of TiVo users who squeeze better performance out of their boxes by hacking into them . Two how-to books on the topic will be published in August ( TiVo Hacks , O'Reilly ; Hacking the TiVo , Premier Press ) . There 's also a step-by-step guide at
