This was one Olympic site that had been completed ahead of schedule  --  by some 2,500 years . It was free of commerce and awash in sportsmanship . In other words , it was unlike an Olympic event , ancient or modern . It was , as U.S. silver medalist Adam Nelson called it , " shot put Nirvana , " held in the house of Zeus . With the sun rising over verdant hills , crowds streamed into the ancient grounds of Olympia , 200 miles west of Athens , for the shot put competition . With no stands and no scoreboard , the stadium stood as it had in A.D. 393 , when it had last hosted the Games . The shot putters paraded on the field beneath the same archway as did the ancient Olympians . " It was awesome to walk into the stadium , " said U.S. competitor John Godina . The shot putters had the 15,000 spectators all to themselves . For once they were the stars , not just a sideshow in the track-and-field circus . The 10-hour event , won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yuriy Bilonog ( men 's ) , came down to the final throws , a rousing end to a glorious day . " I 'm tired , hungry , thirsty and covered in ancient dirt , " said a spectator . " And wish I could do it all over again . "  --  By Jane Wulf/Olympia
