Chapter One The nursery was extraordinarily full . Two of the three older girls-Rachel and Jeanette-were downstairs , hovering on the brink of adulthood , and Theresa was at boarding school on Manticore , but the remaining five Mayhew children , their nannies , and their personal armsmen made a respectable mob . Then there was Faith Katherine Honor Stephanie Miranda Harrington , Miss Harrington , heir to Harrington Steading , and her younger twin brother , James Andrew Benjamin , and their personal armsmen . And lest that not be enough bodies to crowd even a nursery this large , there was her own modest person-Admiral Lady Dame Honor Harrington , Steadholder and Duchess Harrington , and her personal armsman . Not to mention one obviously amused treecat . Given the presence of seven children , the oldest barely twelve , four nannies , nine armsmen ( Honor herself had gotten off with only Andrew LaFollet , but Faith was accompanied by two of her three personal armsmen ) , and one Steadholder , the decibel level was actually remarkably low , she reflected . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enough ! " Gena Smith , the senior member of Protector Palace 's child-care staff , said firmly in the no-nonsense voice which had thwarted-more or less-the determination of the elder Mayhew daughters to grow upas cheerful barbarians . " What is Lady Harrington going to think of you ? " " It 's too late to try to fool her about that now , Gigi , " Honor Mayhew , one of Honor 's godchildren , said cheerfully . " She 's known all of us since we were born ! " " But you can at least pretend you 've been exposed to the rudiments of proper behavior , " Gena said firmly , although the glare she bestowed upon her unrepentant charge was somewhat undermined by the twinkle which went with it . At twelve , the girl had her own bedroom , but she 'd offered to spend the night with the littles under the circumstances , which was typical of her . " Oh , she knows that , " the younger Honor said soothingly now . " I 'm sure she knows we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best I can hope for , " Gena sighed . " I 'm not exactly unaware of the ... challenge you face with this lot , " Honor assured her . " These two , particularly , " she added , giving her much younger twin siblings a very old-fashioned look . They only grinned back at her , at least as unrepentant as young Honor . " On the other hand , " she continued , " I think between us we have them outnumbered . And they actually seem a bit less rowdy tonight . " " Well , of course- " Gena began , then stopped and shook her head . A flash of irritation showed briefly in the backs of her gray-blue eyes . " What I meant , My Lady , is that they 're usually on their better behavior-they do n't actually have a best behavior , you understand-when you 're here . " Honor nodded in response to both the interrupted comment , and the one Gena had actually made . Her eyes met the younger woman's-at forty-eight T-years , Gena Smith was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that still made her over twelve T-years younger than Honor-for just a moment , and then the two of them returned their attention to the pajama-clad children . Despite Gena 's and Honor 's comments , the three assistant nannies had sorted out their charges with the efficiency of long practice . Faith and James were out from under the eye of their own regular nanny , but they were remarkably obedient to the Palace 's substitutes . No doubt because they were only too well aware that their armsmen would be reporting back to " Aunt Miranda , " Honor thought dryly . Teeth had already been brushed , faces had already been washed , and all seven of them had been tucked into their beds while she and Gena were talking . Somehow they made it all seem much easier than Honor 's own childhood memories of the handful she 'd been . " All right , " she said to the room at large . " Who votes for what ? " " The Phoenix ! " six-year-old Faith said immediately . " The Phoenix ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-year-old Alexandra Mayhew seconded . " But you 've already heard that one , " Honor pointed out . " Some of you , " she glanced at her namesake , " more often than others . " The twelve-year-old Honor smiled . She really was an extraordinarily beautiful child , and for that matter , it probably was n't fair to be thinking of her as a " child " these days , really , Honor reminded herself . " I do n't mind , Aunt Honor , " she said . " You know you got me stuck on it early . Besides , Lawrence and Arabella have n't heard it yet . " She nodded at her two youngest siblings . At four and three , respectively , their graduation to the " big kids " section of the nursery was still relatively recent . " I 'd like to hear it again , too , Aunt Honor . Please , " Bernard Raoul said quietly . He was a serious little boy , not surprisingly , perhaps , since he was also Heir Apparent to the Protectorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it appeared , could have lit up an auditorium . Now she saw just a flash of it as she looked down at him . " Well , the vote seems fairly solid , " she said after a moment . " Mistress Smith ? " " I suppose they 've behaved themselves fairly well , all things considered . This time , at least , " Gena said as she bestowed an ominous glower upon her charges , most of whom giggled . " In that case , " Honor said , and crossed to the old-fashioned bookcase between the two window seats on the nursery 's eastern wall . Nimitz shifted his weight for balance on her shoulder as she leaned forward slightly , running a fingertip across the spines of the archaic books to the one she wanted , and took it from the shelf . That book was at least twice her own age , a gift from her to the Mayhew children , as the copy of it on her own shelf at home had been a gift from her Uncle Jacques when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far older even than that . She had two electronic copies of it as well-including one with the original Raysor illustrations-but there was something especially right about having it in printed form , and somehow it just kept turning up periodically in the small , specialty press houses that catered to people like her uncle and his SCA friends . She crossed to the reclining armchair , as old-fashioned and anachronistic as the printed book in her hands itself , and Nimitz leapt lightly from her shoulder to the top of the padded chair back . He sank his claws into the upholstery , arranging himself comfortably , as Honor settled into the chair which had sat in the Mayhew nursery-reupholstered and even rebuilt at need-for almost seven hundred T-years . The attentive eyes of the children watched her while she adjusted the chair to exactly the right angle , and she and the ' cat savored the bright , clean emotions washing out from them . No wonder treecats had always loved children , she thought . There was something so ... marvelously whole about them . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they loved as they trusted , without stint or limit . That was always a gift to be treasured . Especially now . She looked up as the veritable horde of armsmen withdrew . Colonel LaFollet , as the senior armsman present , watched with a faint twinkle of his own as the heavily armed , lethally trained bodyguards more or less tiptoed out of the nursery . He watched the nannies follow them , then held the door courteously for Gena and bowed her through it before he came briefly to attention , nodded to Honor , and stepped through it himself . She knew he would be standing outside it when she left , however long she stayed . It was his job , even here , at the very heart of Protector 's Palace , where it seemed unlikely any desperate assassins lurked . The door closed behind him , and she looked around at her audience in the big , suddenly much calmer and quieter room . " Lawrence , Arabella , " she said to the youngest Mayhews , " you have n't heard this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it . It 's a very special book . It was written long , long ago , before anyone had ever left Old Earth itself . " Lawrence 's eyes widened just a bit . He was a precocious child , and he loved tales about the history of humankind 's ancient homeworld . " It 's called David and the Phoenix , " she went on , " and it 's always been one of my very favorite stories . And my mother loved it when she was a little girl , too . You 'll have to listen carefully . It 's in Standard English , but some of the words have changed since it was written . If you hear one you do n't understand , stop and ask me what it means . All right ? " Both toddlers nodded solemnly , and she nodded back . Then she opened the cover . The smell of ancient ink and paper , so utterly out of place in the modern world , rose from the pages like some secret incense . She inhaled , drawing it deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sphinx afternoons , cold Sphinx evenings , and the sense of utter security and peacefulness that was the monopoly of childhood . " David and the Phoenix , by Edward Ormondroyd , " she read . " Chapter One , In Which David Goes Mountain Climbing and a Mysterious Voice Is Overheard . " She glanced up , and her chocolate-dark , almond-shaped eyes smiled as the children settled more comfortably into their beds , watching her raptly . " All the way there David had saved this moment for himself , " she began , " struggling not to peek until the proper time came . When the car finally stopped , the rest of them got out stiffly and went into the new house . But David walked slowly into the back yard with his eyes fixed on the ground . For a whole minute he stood there , not daring to look up . Then he took a deep breath , clenched his hands tightly , and lifted his head . " There it was ! - as Dad had described it , but infinitely more grand . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaring , so tall that its misty blue peak could surely talk face-to-face with the stars . To David , who had never seen a mountain before , the sight was almost too much to bear . He felt so tight and shivery inside that he did n't know whether he wanted to laugh , or cry , or both . And the really wonderful thing about the Mountain was the way it looked at him . He was certain that it was smiling at him , like an old friend who had been waiting for years to see him again . And when he closed his eyes , he seemed to hear a voice which whispered , ' Come along , then , and climb . ' " She glanced up again , feeling the children folding themselves more closely about her as the ancient words rolled over them . She felt Nimitz , as well , sharing her own memories of her mother 's voice reading the same story to her and memories of other mountains , even grander than the ancient David 's , and rambles through them-memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would be so easy to go ! " she continued . " The back yard was hedged in ( with part of the hedge growing right across the toes of the Mountain ) , but ... " * * * " I imagine it 's too much to hope they were all asleep ? " " You imagine correctly , " Honor said dryly , stepping through the massive , inlaid doors of polished oak into the palatial chamber which the Palace guides modestly referred to as " the Library . " " Not that you really expected them to be , now did you ? " " Of course not , but we neo-barbarian planetary despots get used to demanding the impossible . And when we do n't get it , we behead the unfortunate soul who disappointed us . " Benjamin IX , Planetary Protector of Grayson , grinned at her , standing with his back to the log fire crackling on the hearth behind him , and she shook her head . " I knew that eventually all this absolute power would go to your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majeste which would have horrified a third of the planet 's steadholders and infuriated another third . " Oh , between us , Elaine and I keep him trimmed down to size , Honor , " Katherine Mayhew , Benjamin 's senior wife said . " Well , us and the kids , " Elaine Mayhew , Benjamin 's junior wife corrected . " I understand , " she continued with a cheerful smile , " that young children help keep parents younger . " " That which does not kill us makes us younger ? " Benjamin misquoted . " Something like that , " Elaine replied . At thirty-seven T-years , she was almost twelve years younger than her husband and almost six years younger than her senior wife . Of course , she was almost a quarter T-century younger than Honor ... who was one of the youngest looking people in the room . Only the third and most junior of her personal armsmen , Spencer Hawke , and the towering young lieutenant commander in Grayson Navy uniform , looked younger than she did . Prolong did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded her why they were all here , and Nimitz pressed his cheek against the side of her face with a soft , comforting croon . Benjamin 's eyes narrowed , and she tasted his spike of recognition . Well , he 'd always been an extraordinarily sharp fellow , and spending eight T-years as the father of a daughter who 'd been adopted by a treecat had undoubtedly sensitized him . She gave him another smile , then crossed to the young man in the naval uniform . He was a veritable giant for a Grayson-indeed , he was actually taller than Honor was-and although she was in civilian attire , he came to attention and bowed respectfully . She ignored the bow and enfolded him in a firm embrace . He stiffened for an instant-in surprise , not resistance-and then hugged her back , a bit awkwardly . " Is there any new word , Carson ? " she asked quietly , stepping back a half-pace and letting her hands slide down to rest on his forearms . " No , My Lady , " he said sadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He smiled faintly . " I told her it was n't necessary . It 's not as if this falls into her area of specialization , and we all know there 's really nothing to be done now except to wait . But she insisted . " " Howard 's her friend , too , " Honor said . She glanced at Andrew LaFollet . " Is Daddy with her , Andrew ? " " Yes , My Lady . Since Faith and James are safely tucked away here in the nursery , I sent Jeremiah to keep an eye on them . " Honor cocked her head , and he shrugged slightly . " He wanted to go , My Lady . " " I see . " She looked back at Carson Clinkscales and gave his forearms another little squeeze , then released them . " She knows there 's nothing she can really do , Carson , " she said . " But she 'd never forgive herself if she were n't there for your aunts . By rights , I ought to be there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Howard is ninety-two years old , and he 's touched a lot of lives in that much time-including mine . If everyone who ' ought to be there ' really were there , there 'd be no room for the patients . And he 's been in the coma for almost three days now . If you were there , and if he knew you were there , he 'd read you the riot act for neglecting everything else you ought to be doing . " " I know , " she sighed . " I know . It 's just- " She stopped and shook her head with a slight grimace , and he nodded understandingly . But he did n't really understand , not completely , she thought . Despite the changes which had come to Grayson , his own thought processes and attitudes had been evolved in a pre-prolong society . To him , Howard Clinkscales was old ; for Honor , Howard should have been less than middle-aged . Her own mother , who looked considerably younger than Katherine Mayhew , or even Elaine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was twelve T-years years older than Howard . And if he was the first of her Grayson friends she was losing to old age so preposterously young , he would n't be the last . Gregory Paxton 's health was failing steadily , as well . And even Benjamin and his wives showed the signs of premature aging she 'd come to dread . Her mind flashed back to the nursery and the book she 'd been reading , with its tale of the immortal , ever-renewed Phoenix , and the memory was more bittersweet than usual as she saw the silver lightly threading the Protector 's still-thick , dark hair . " Your offspring and my beloved siblings did quite well , actually , " she said , deliberately seeking a change of subject . " I 'm always a bit surprised by how they settle down for reading . Especially with all the other more interactive avenues of amusement they have . " ( Continues ... )
