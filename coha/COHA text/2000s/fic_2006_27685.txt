Prologue Christmas 2006 It was time . Emily Anderson had waited all her life for this moment . The box on the floor in front of her held the hope of a lifetime ... her lifetime . Inside could be a window , a glimpse , a pathway to the past , to a time still littered with question marks . But what if it was n't ? What if it was nothing ? For a moment Emily could only sit , stone still , and stare at it . Doubts gathered around her like summer storm clouds . This was her last chance . If the box held only high school mementoes , framed photographs , and old stuffed animals , then she 'd know she 'd reached her final dead end . And barring a miracle , her search for her parents would be over . She laid her hands on the dusty cardboard top and traced her fingers across the words . Lauren 's Things . The box would be nearly nineteen years old now . A lump stuck in her throat and she swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at her mother 's name . " Did you leave me a trail ? " She closed her eyes and hugged the box . " Please , God , let there be something here . " Downstairs her grandparents were fixing dinner . They 'd given her this time . Her tender old papa had found the worn box in the garage stashed away in a cobwebbed corner with a dozen other forgotten cartons . He had known how much it would mean to her , how long she 'd been waiting for a breakthrough like this . " Emily , honey , " he 'd told her when she came home from college that day . " This belonged to your mother . " He held the box in his hands . As tall as she was , she still felt tiny next to him . He had to look around the brown edges of the box to see her . " I 'll take it to your room . You 'll need some time . " Indeed . She opened her eyes and stared at the box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard . As if maybe she could see inside before she tore into it and found out for sure . Panic tap-danced around her , and she grabbed two quick breaths . What if she went through the whole thing and found no clues at all ? Two more breaths . Come on , Emily . Exhale . She tightened her middle , pursed her lips , and blew out . God , get me through this . There has to be something . How many times had she prayed for a clue or a sign ? A trail that would lead her to her parents , even for a day ? Then she could ask them why they 'd left and how come they never cared to find out what happened to their little girl ? Emotion flooded her , tightening her throat , closing her eyes . Memories rushed back like forgotten classmates - hateful ones , who used to laugh when you were n't picked at recess . Suddenly she was in kindergarten again , at the Mother 's Day luncheon . She and the other boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty painted flowers coming from the top of every finger . They sang a song , and Emily could hear their young , off-key voices booming out , " Thanks for all you do ... Mommy , I love you ! " As with everything around Mother 's Day , Emily directed the words to her grandma . Even back then , she 'd known . She was the only kindergartner without a mother . The only one whose mommy left when she was just a few weeks old . Now she watched her kindergarten self as the memory of what happened next played back , every painful detail intact ... " Grandma , " she asked , " where is my mommy ? Do you know ? " Her grandmother got sort of nervous . " No , sweetie . Papa and I tried to find her but , well , we have n't had any luck . " Emily had felt suddenly lost . Like the day she was at the park and could n't find her papa . Then an idea came to her . She smoothed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes in motion . " Maybe I could find her ! " " Honey . " Her grandma patted her hair . " I do n't think she wants to be found . " And that was that . Emily drew a shuddering breath , relieved that the memory was over . But on its heels came another . The time she was thirteen and all of eighth grade was getting " the talk . " " I feel funny talking about girl stuff in school , " she told one of her friends at lunch that day . " Seems like it should be private . " " So talk to your mom . " The friend smiled . " Moms are great for that . " The emptiness and loss were so terrible , Emily felt like an actual hole in her heart , a hole so thorough she bet her friend could see straight through her . That afternoon , Emily went home and made a promise . Someday , I 'm going to find my parents . No matter what . Emily brushed a hand across her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the haunting thoughts . She opened her eyes and stared at the box . Eventually her grandparents got Internet access . After that there were days of typing in her mother 's name - L-a-u-r-e-n A-n-d-e-r-s-o-n - and searching through lists of schoolteachers and scientists and track stars , but never - not in all the thousand entries that popped up , making her breathless with possibility - did she find her mother . Same with her dad . She 'd spent hopeless afternoons looking for him any way she could imagine . And now , at eighteen , she was no closer to finding them than when she first started . What she wanted - what she 'd always wanted - was the truth . Because the sketchy details she knew made up barely a handful of dots . Nowhere near enough to connect . Cobwebs stuck to the top of the box , and Emily brushed them off . She let her hands rest on the old , worn carton , wondering . Could it be ? Did this box hold the secrets - secrets that would answer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did her mother leave ? Where was she ? Why had n't she been in touch since she ran away ? Had her parents ever connected again ? She gripped the top of the box . Maybe ... maybe she was about to discover enough pieces to put together a trail . And maybe the trail would lead her to the story . She could n't wait another minute as she opened the side flaps . It was really happening ; she was about to see her mother 's things , touch them and read them and breathe them in . Her heart beat so hard and fast she wondered if her grandparents could hear it downstairs . She peered inside . The first few items were framed photographs of her parents . Emily reached in , lifting them with careful fingers . Beneath them were yearbooks and folded handwritten letters . Emily 's heart jumped . Hours of exploration stretched before her . As she pulled out the contents of the box , she lay each item on her bed , staring at it even as she reached for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her dad to her mom , maybe words that explained the feelings they had for each other or their plans for after their baby was born ? She would read them later . For now she had to keep digging , because she had to make it through the entire box , just in case . In case the answers lay somewhere near the bottom . She reached back into the carton and pulled out another layer of pictures and photo albums , and two-thirds of the way down , a tattered stuffed bear . Only after the bear was removed did she see something that caused her loud , demanding heart to jerk to a silent halt . Journals . Eight ... maybe ten of them . And beneath those , what looked like notebooks , dozens of notebooks . Emily rifled through the carton , collecting the journals and placing them on the bed next to the photos , yearbooks , and letters . Then she pulled out the first notebook and opened it . The pages were a little warped and yellowed , filled with page after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught her breath . She 'd found it . A missing piece . Her mother was a writer ! She set that notebook on the bedspread and reached for another . This one was thicker , and on the front someone - her mother probably - had written , " Lauren loves Shane . " Emily stared at the words and felt the sting of tears in her eyes . Her hands trembled and she ran her thumb over the words . She slid further back on the bed , until she was leaning against the wall . She propped a pillow behind her and settled in . The clues she 'd been hunting for all her life had to be here , buried somewhere between the paper covers of these spiral-bound notebooks . In the stories her mother had written , the stories she 'd left behind . Tales of her parents ' love . Maybe the story of their loss . And perhaps even the reason why they 'd gone away and left their baby to live without them . Biting her lip , Emily turned the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single detail , she began to read .
