Prologue Twenty years earlier Our Lady of Virtues Hospital Near New Orleans , Louisiana She felt his breath . Warm . Seductive . Erotically evil . A presence that caused the hairs on the back of her neck to lift , her skin to prickle , sweat to collect upon her spine . Her heart thumped , and barely able to move , standing in the darkness , she searched the shadowed corners of her room frantically . Through the open window she heard the reverberating songs of the frogs in the nearby swamps and the rumble of a train upon faraway tracks . But here , now , he was with her . Go away , she tried to say , but held her tongue , hoping beyond hope that he would n't notice her standing near the window . On the other side of the panes , security lamps illuminated the grounds with pale , bluish light , and she realized belatedly that her body , shrouded only by a sheer nightgown , was silhouetted in their eerie glow . Of course he could see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throat dry , she stepped backward , placing a hand on the window casing to steady herself . Maybe she had just imagined his presence . Maybe she had n't heard the door open after all . Maybe she 'd jumped up from a drug-induced sleep too quickly . After all , it was n't late , only eight in the evening . Maybe she was safe in this room , her room , on the third floor . Maybe . She was reaching for the bedside light when she heard the softscrape of leather against hardwood . Her throat closed on a silent scream . Having adjusted to the half-light , her eyes took in the bed with its mussed sheets , evidence of her fitful rest . Upon the dressing table was the lamp and a bifold picture frame ; one that held small portraits of her two daughters . Across the small room was a fireplace . She could see its decorative tile and cold grate and , above the mantle , a bare spot , faded now where a mirror had once hung . So where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond , the October night was hot and sultry . In the panes she could see her wan reflection : petite , small-boned frame ; sad gold eyes ; high cheekbones ; lustrous auburn hair pulled away from her face . And behind her ... was that a shadow creeping near ? Or her imagination ? That was the trouble . Sometimes he hid . But he was always nearby . Always . She could feel him , hear his soft , determined footsteps in the hallway , smell his scent-a mixture of male musk and sweat-catch a glimpse of a quick , darting shadow as he passed . There was no getting away from him . Ever . Not even in the dead of night . He received great satisfaction in surprising her , sneaking up on her while she was sitting at her desk , leaning down behind her when she was kneeling at her bedside . He was always ready to press his face to the back of her neck , to reach around her and touch her breasts , arousing her though she loathed him , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erection against her back . She was n't safe when she was under the thin spray of the shower , nor while sleeping beneath the covers of her small bed . How ironic that they had placed her here ... for her own safety . " Go away , " she whispered , her head pounding , her thoughts disjointed . " Leave me alone ! " She blinked and tried to focus . Where was he ? Nervously she trained her eyes on the one hiding place , the closet . She licked her lips . The wooden door was ajar , just slightly , enough that anyone inside could peer through the crack . From the small sliver of darkness within the closet , something seemed to glimmer . A reflection . Eyes ? Oh , God . Maybe he was inside . Waiting . Gooseflesh broke out on her skin . She should call out to someone , but if she did , she would be restrained , medicated ... or worse . Stop it , Faith . Do n't get paranoid ! But the glittering eyes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one arm around her middle , the other folded over it , she scraped her nails on the skin of her elbow . Scratch , scratch , scratch . But maybe this was all a bad dream . A nightmare . Was n't that what the sisters had assured her in their soft whispers as they gently patted her hands and stared at her with compassionate , disbelieving eyes ? An ugly dream . Yes ! A nightmare of vast , intense proportions . Even the nurse had agreed with the nuns , telling her that what she 'd thought she 'd seen was n't real . And the doctor , cold , clinical , with the bedside manner of a stone monkey , had talked to her as if she were a small , stupid child . " There , there , Faith , no one is following you , " he 'd said , wearing a thin , patronizing smile . " No one is watching you . You know that . You 're ... you 're just confused . You 're safe here . Remember , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she scratched more anxiously , her short fingernails running over the smooth skin of her forearm , encountering scabs . Home ? This monstrous place ? She closed her eyes , grabbed the headboard of the bed to steady herself . Was she really as sick as they said ? Did she really see people who were n't there ? That 's what they 'd told her , time and time again , to the point that she was no longer certain what was real and what was not . Maybe that was the plot against her , to make her believe she was as crazy as they insisted she was . She heard a footstep and looked up quickly . The hairs on the backs of her arms rose . She began to shake as she saw the door crack open a bit more . " Sweet Jesus . " Trembling , she backed up , her gaze fixed on the closet , her fingers scraping her forearm like mad . The door creaked open in slow motion . " Go away ! " she whispered , her stomach knotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a weapon ! Anxiously , she looked around the near-dark room with its bed bolted to the floor . Get your letter opener ! Now ! She took one step toward the desk before she remembered that Sister Madeline had taken the letter opener away from her . The lamp on the night table ! But it , too , was screwed down . She pressed the switch . Click . No great wash of light . Frantically , she hit the switch again . Over and over . Click ! Click ! Click ! Click ! She looked up and saw him then . A tall man , looming in front of the door to the hallway . It was too dark to see his features but she knew his wicked smile was in place , his eyes glinting with an evil need . He was Satan Incarnate . And there was no way to escape from him . There never was . " Please do n't , " she begged , her voice sounding pathetic and weak as she backed up , her legs quivering . " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't place your fingers anywhere on my body ... do n't tell me I 'm beautiful ... do n't kiss me ... " Leave now , " she insisted . Dear God , was there no weapon , nothing to stop him ? " Leave now or what ? " " Or I 'll scream and call the guards . " " The guards , " he repeated in that low , amused , nearly hypnotic voice . " Here ? " He clucked his tongue as if she were a disobedient child . " You 've tried that before . " She knew for certain that her plight was futile . She would submit to him again . As she always did . " Did the guards believe you the last time ? " Of course they had n't . Why would they ? The two scrawny , pimply-faced boys had n't hidden the fact they considered her mad . At least that 's what they 'd insinuated , though they 'd used fancier words ... delusional ... paranoid ... schizophrenic ... Or had they said anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with their pitying , yet hungry , eyes . Had n't one of them told her she was sexy ? The other one cupping one cheek of her buttocks ... or ... or had that all been a horrid , vivid nightmare ? Scratch , scratch , scratch . She felt her nails break the skin . Humiliation washed over her . She inched backward , away from her tormentor . What was happening to her was her own fault . She 'd sinned somehow , brought this upon herself . She was the one who was evil . She had instigated God 's wrath . She alone could atone . " Go away , " she whispered again , clawing more frantically at her arm . " Faith , do n't , " he warned , his voice horrifyingly soothing . " Mutilating yourself wo n't change anything . I 'm here to help you . You know that . " Help her ? No ... no , no , no ! She wanted to crumble onto the floor , to shed her guilt , to get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't let him force you into doing things that you know are wrong ! You have will . You ca n't let him do this to you . But it was already too late . Close to her now , he clucked his tongue again and she saw its pointy , wet , pink tip flicking against the back of his teeth . In a rough whisper , he said , " Uh-oh , Faith , I think you 've been a naughty girl again . " " No . " She was whimpering . There it was ... that horrid bit of excitement building inside her . " Oh , Faith , do n't you know it 's a sin to lie ? " She glanced to the wall where the crucifix of Jesus was nailed into the plaster . Did it move ? Blinking , she imagined Jesus staring at her , his eyes kind but silently reprimanding in the semidarkness . No , Faith . That ca n't be . Get a grip , for God 's sake . It 's a painted image , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Christ 's tortured face to the fireplace ... cold now , devoid of both ashes and the mirror above it , now an empty space , the outline visible against the rosebud wallpaper . They said she broke the mirror in a fit of rage , that she 'd cut herself . That her own image had caused her to panic . But he 'd done it , had n't he ? This devil whose sole intent was to torture her ? Had n't she witnessed the act ? She 'd tried to refuse him , and he 'd crashed his fist into the looking glass . Mirrored shards sprayed , hitting her , then crashed to the floor like glittery , deadly knives . That 's what had happened . Right ? Or not ? Now , feeling the blood beneath her nails , she wondered . What 's happening to me ? She stared at her bloodied hands . Her fingernails , once manicured and polished , were broken , her palms scratched , and farther up , upon her wrists , healed deep gashes . Had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw her hands wrapped around a shard of glass and the blood dripping from her fingers ... Because you were going to kill him ... trying to protect yourself ! She closed her eyes and let out a long , mewling cry . It was true . She did n't know what to believe any longer . Truth and lies blended , fact and fiction fused , her life , once so ordinary , so predictable , was fragmented . Frayed . At her own hands . ( Continues ... )
