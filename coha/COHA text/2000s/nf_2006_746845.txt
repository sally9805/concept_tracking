ASP Connects with Informal Science Educators <p> Regulars readers of Mercury may already know that the ASP has greatly expanded its audience for astronomy education professional development through " Astronomy from the Ground Up " ( AFGU ) , an NSF-funded program developed to provide informal science educators at small to medium-sized science centers and museums with new and innovative ways to communicate the excitement of modern astronomy to their visitors . As early as 2004 , members of the ASP 's education staff started regularly attending the Association of Science-Technology Centers ' ( ASTC ) Annual Conference to meet informal science educators and to learn more about their specific needs . In late October of this year , we conducted a workshop at the 2006 ASTC Conference in Louisville , Kentucky , to inform these science center professionals about AFGU and about what we are learning about professional development through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ASTC ( a major partner in AFGU ) to help its members interpret current astronomical research for public audiences . A recent online chat was held through ASTC Connects  --  ASTC 's online learning center for science center and museum professionals  --  with former ASP President Katharine Garmany about her research at Kitt Peak National Observatory . And a recent issue of their members ' magazine , ASTC Dimensions , featured articles by ASP President Dennis Schatz , ASP staff members , and major partners and advisors from AFGU . As the ASP 's relationship with ASTC and the world of informal science educators grows , do not be surprised if you find yourself more engaged in hands-on astronomy at your local nature center or science museum  --  an experience that we believe should be an opportunity in every community .
