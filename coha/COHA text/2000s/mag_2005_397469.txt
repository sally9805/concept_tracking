Section : Out front TELEVISION The big networks are selling TV shows la carte . But their cable rivals are the ones remaking television . <p> VIEWERS AND TV CRITICS ALIKE jeered at the debut of Pacific Blue nine years ago . The schlocky made-for-cable drama , which aired on USA Network , was a weak heir to the 1970s network hit CHiPs , with cops riding bicycles instead of motorcycles . It epitomized the state of original cable programming a decade ago : cheap , chintzy and wooden . <p> " It was n't too long ago you were watching a cable show and you knew just by looking at it , " admits Matthew C. Blank , chief executive of Viacom 's Showtime . But made-for-cable these days has taken on an utterly opposite connotation  --  delivering shows that are lushly produced , eruditely written , startlingly graphic , gratifyingly adult and often hilarious where they mean to be . <p> Showtime 's critically acclaimed Weeds , a funny and touching look at a suburban soccer mom who turns to selling pot after her husband dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four major broadcast networks spawned most of the programming that filled up the TV dial . This year cable channels will spend $13.4 billion on their own often boundary-pushing shows , up 65% in four years . <p> Fox 's FX channel , emboldened by the success of its hyperviolent cop drama The Shield , has added a flurry of new shows , including a sitcom called It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , a racier version of Cheers . Scads of new reality series on cable are one-upping The Apprentice on NBC : One on A &E,; Intervention , rivetingly focuses on addicts ( methamphetamine , sex , gambling ) and captures them in confrontations orchestrated by loved ones . <p> Time Warner 's HBO pay channel set off this Platinum Age of television with the debut of The Sopranos six years ago . It leveraged cable 's innate advantages over the big broadcasters : the freedom to depict R-rated themes , language and action ; the flexibility to air each episode multiple times in a week ; and the latitude to worry less about advertiser pressures and forgo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( HBO airs no ads , and cable channels get a second income stream from local operators . ) <p> Now HBO spends $100 million on the epic series Rome , blending ornate sets with pricey special effects . Other cable channels have followed suit , rapidly replacing the Big Four broadcasters ( ABC , CBS , NBC and Fox ) as the purveyors of the best-quality television . Says Scott Winant , a producer of such network hits as Thirtysomething , My So-Called Life and The West Wing : " If I , as an artist , want to bring new and different stuff to TV , it inevitably ends up on cable . " <p> For most cable channels a profit on a show is nice but not the main point  --  the real objective is to raise the profile and value of a cable brand . " In a multichannel universe , brands matter . The brand is that shortcut in the brain , " says Steven Koonin , a former Coca-Cola Co. marketer who oversees Time Warner 's TNT and TBS . <p> A one-hour episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 million or more , and income from advertising , cable fees , DVDs , pay-per-view and international sales typically barely covers the expense . New windows now being pursued by the big broadcasters will add to cable 's upside . ABC sells reruns of Desperate Housewives for Apple 's iPod handheld player at $1.99 an episode ; NBC has just begun selling 99-cent reruns from its Law and Order franchise and other series via DirecTV ; in January CBS begins selling 99-cent replays of its CSI series , Survivor and other shows on Comcast cable systems hours after their first run . <p> But while the old nets race toward an on-demand world where channels lose out to ordering shows la carte , cable spends massive sums on high-end original series to associate its brands with show lineups that can hold viewers ' loyalty and respect . <p> Even in this cluttered era of hundreds of channels , the typical viewer routinely flips among only 14 or so favorite outlets , says Koonin . " The mind ca n't handle an infinite number of channels , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the rest are stumbled upon by channel surfers , he adds . <p> Koonin believes a cable service should brand itself pretty much the same way he used to brand a soda . " TNT . We know drama , " is that outlet 's tagline . TBS , once vaguely billed as the " Superstation , " now focuses on comedy : " TBS . Very Funny . " First-run shows are the key to defining your brand , he says . TBS is now shooting pilots for six new comedies . TNT 's biggest investment was this year 's elaborate Steven Spielberg-produced miniseries , Into the West , with six one-hour episodes , that cost a reported total of $50 million to make . <p> The show was a hit , accumulating 30 million viewers as each segment aired six times . Better yet , almost 30% of the adult viewers under age 50 were new to TNT , and many stuck around to watch shows like the Kyra Sedgwick cop drama , The Closer . Into the West also lured half a dozen new advertisers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stephen King 's Nightmares and Dreamscapes . <p> News Corp . ' s FX has worked to establish itself as a Fox-on-amphetamines , with edgy , often shocking shows . Anthony Vinciquerra , head of Fox Networks Group , puts it this way : " On Fox you know you are not going to find Little House on the Prairie . FX is even more finely branded . " <p> FX specializes in shows with painfully flawed heroes . Rescue Me focuses on an alcoholic New York City firefighter mourning the drunk-driver death of his 10-year-old son . Though typically it gets only 2.9 million viewers per airing  --  compared with 25 million for a top-ten hit such as Desperate Housewives on ABC  --  Rescue Me rates high among high-income adults under age 50 . " I was going to say it 's a big hit , but what 's a big hit ? " says Vinciquerra . " It 's a show that is successful in hitting its target audience . If we ran Rescue Me on broadcast , it would be a dismal failure . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not necessarily the same thing , " says HBO 's entertainment president , Carolyn Strauss , who green-lighted Sex in the City , The Sopranos and other hits . Cable shows captured 188 Emmy nominations this year versus the broadcast networks ' 218 ; five years ago cable got only 138 nominations while the networks got 254 . <p> Cable shows use higher quality to stand out from the old nets , says producer Winant . " I really do at times pity network executives . Their jobs must be so hard , " he says . He now works on Showtime 's Huff , a darkly comic drama about a psychiatrist in crisis , and the channel agreed to spend thousands per episode to move filming from Vancouver to Los Angeles and to shoot more on location . <p> For viewers the story arc is clear : More new shows and more good shows are on the way than ever before . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Lavish budgets for Showtime 's Huff , starring Hank Azaria , led to love from critics  --  and seven Emmy nominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV : Stephen King 's series , Nightmares and Dreamscapes , will air on TNT . <p> By Scott Woolley <p>
