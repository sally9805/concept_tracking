<p> NOW THAT TAIL-DOCKING IS N'T PC . . . <p> Editor  --  I think I 'm going to be sick . Yet another brigade of PC-thinking , horse-blinder-wearing activists have vilified an age-old practice . Now it 's those evil tail-and-ear-cropping kennel clubs that are making life unbearable for the dogs we love ( " Pet Peeve  --  S.F. Panel Votes To Ban Cosmetic Surgery , " May 12 ) . Never mind that there are very good reasons for streamlining a dog 's profile . <p> I realize that just about every dog in San Francisco is born to love , and that is the highest purpose for their masters ( oh , excuse me , guardians ) , but that does n't give us the right to forget our original , and still very valid , relationship with these animals . Get this , city dwellers : Dogs hunt . They love to hunt . It just so happens that for some happy hunting dogs ( like a German short-hair pointer ) , working alongside their bipedal brethren , a long , briar-catching tail can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment separates us from the roots of animal integration into our society . This has a definite and predictable effect on our thinking , but it does not give us the right to erase or ignore the genesis of the canine/homo sapiens partnership . Next up for the **29;1960;TOOLONG : human circumcision . <p> ROBERT DOW WILLIAMS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ON DA MAYOR 'S PAYROLL <p> Editor  --  The Matier and Ross column ( Chronicle , May 15 ) on the disgusting ( Wendy ) Linka tale should offend everyone . This woman is apparently unqualified for anything , yet Willie Brown 's power and authority insulates her from all problems and keeps her on the payroll no matter what she does or does n't do . She should be fired immediately and her story be one more example of why Brown should be voted out at the first opportunity . This wheeling and dealing should be stopped . Congrats to Matier and Ross for exposing this disgrace . <p> WALTER S. MOE , <p> Col. , U.S. Air Force Ret . <p> El Dorado Hills ( Placer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor  --  The Program for Assertive Community Treatment ( " A Door Back to Real Life , " May 11 ) sounds like a euphemism for dumping the mentally ill into impoverished urban neighborhoods in an effort to save money . <p> Naturally , the big losers in this program are the patients themselves , thrust into a rough neighborhood with little medical supervision . Can anyone really expect these people to get better in such an environment ? <p> Such transgressions against the mentally ill will continue as long as their plight is viewed as an urban problem . These patients come from rural , suburban and urban communities , but it is the urban centers that pick up the tab . Unless the federal and state governments are forced to fund their fair share of the cost to solve this problem , the prognosis for many of the mentally ill remains dim . <p> JEFFREY WEISS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> HISTORICAL NOTE OF NOTE <p> Editor  --  We were dismayed that the article on Washington Square Park ( " Anything But Square , " May 12 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y Tapia de Miranda , who always called herself simply " Juana Briones . " From 1836 until 1847 , Briones lived in the " cow pasture " that later became Washington Square . We believe , despite Mr. Nolte 's omission , that Briones is a historical figure worthy of at least a passing reference . <p> Briones gave shelter and assistance to seamen who were determined to escape the brutal conditions aboard the ships that came into the bay . She hid them and helped them heal and then enlisted the help of her brother who took them further inland to Contra Costa . <p> Mr. Nolte did state one truism : " Washington Square is . . . a beautiful place where nothing is as it seems to be . " <p> WILMA ESPINOZA and <p> ANITA MARTINEZ <p> Belmont and San Francisco <p> . <p> WHO WOULD BE FAT ? <p> Editor  --  As a member of the public and as a fat person with a disability , I feel the city 's proposed anti-fat discrimination legislation is urgently needed . Fat children who suffered taunts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to popular opinion , one simply ca n't permanently change one 's size . There is plenty of scientific evidence to show that fat people are usually fat for genetic reasons or as a result of certain illnesses , like hypopituitarism , Cushing 's disease or other medical reasons . It is a disgrace that in the 21st century we are still dealing with basic human rights issues . Believe me , if it were possible to lose weight permanently , there would be no fat people ! Who would choose to be hated , abused and blamed for their physical characteristics if we could choose not to have those characteristics ? <p> SANDRA GORDON <p> Mill Valley <p> . <p> LOADED WITH FACTS <p> Editor  --  Marilyn Wann , author of " Fat ! So ? " gets herself in deep doo-doo when she claims there is no correlation between fat and health , and even deeper when she states that fat people are actually healthier than those of us who are slimmer . This logic is hilariously off the wall . As Americans , we suffer from excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wann may claim to exercise regularly and eat right , what denotes regular exercise and good diet can vary , big time , from person to person . <p> Genetics may play a small part , but is it up to each individual to realize his or her personal responsibility ; it 's much easier to play the prejudice card . If it 's scientific studies that impress her , she should accept that the large majority of studies indicate that overweight people do not enjoy good health , are at substantial risk for disease and do not enjoy the luxury of a long life . These are not prejudicial judgments ; they are statistical facts . <p> MICHAEL BAUCE <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> . <p> SHRINKING MARKET <p> Editor  --  Let me get this straight : Ford Motor Co. admits that SUVs excessively pollute our air and kill Americans in smaller cars , yet they will keep selling SUVs because they make so much money ( " Fod Admits SUVs Are Irresponsible " , May 12 ) ? No wonder the automobile industry spends millions of dollars lobbying elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements . So much for corporate responsibility . I wonder who will buy their cars when we are all dead ? <p> MARK J. CHEKAL <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> FORGET $150 REBATE <p> Editor  --  Gov . Davis ' plan to send rebate checks of $150 to single tax filers and $300 to joint tax filers is perhaps the worst way to spend the state 's surplus . A time of economic prosperity is a time for investing in the future of our state . <p> I do not wish to make $150 seem like a trivial sum of money because , for many of us including myself , it is n't . However , to many of the people who will receive the $150 , this amount is worth less in relative terms than it would be during a time of economic downturn . <p> There is no doubt that Davis would like to leave his mark  --  simply saving of money for times of budgetary shortfall is therefore not a possibility . This , however , does not preclude the use of the $2 billion on one-time projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in investing in education and transportation in recent Davis proposals , more can be done . <p> Social spending is a misnomer . It should perhaps more properly be called social investment . <p> BRYAN HUANG <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> WHAT ABOUT A RAISE ? <p> Editor  --  As a teacher , I find the latest plan of Gov . Gray Davis to be a nice gesture , but it would do very little , if anything , to help teachers in this state . It seems that all our politicians and city leaders want to do is build us special housing or herd us into teacher condominium complexes or give us a tax break . What is wrong with just giving us raises ? <p> I am one of many teachers leaving the Bay Area because I have found a school district that pays better and where the cost of living is half of what it is here . I do n't think teachers should be singled out for a tax break  --  what about firemen , social workers , etc. ?  --  who also provide invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ROBERT WEST <p> San Francisco
