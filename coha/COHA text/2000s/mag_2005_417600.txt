The Persistence of Dal Starting last year , with the 100th anniversary of the birth of the great masturbator , or Avida Dollars , as Andr Breton anagrammatically styled him , there has been a welcome explosion of studies devoted to the self-anointed genius Salvador Dal . Enormously popular , yet often disregarded , Dal has long presented a problem for art historians . No major 20th-century art figure has been or is more difficult to assess , and his heritage seems more open to debate than ever , now that so many contemporary artists stress photographic realism and market strategies while straddling the high-low divide . More an irritant or catalyst than a role model , Dal played a starring part in the history of 20th-century art even as he sometimes seemed to cast himself as a fool on so many fool 's errands . In retrospect , however , even his smallest gestures merit reconsideration . New York dealer and scholar Timothy Baum recalls one evening in the early 1970s at the St. Regis Hotel bar when Dal appeared wearing a special pair of eyeglasses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dal Surrealist objects were ephemeral ! ) . Each lens of these eyeglasses consisted of two pieces of glass with a space in between them ; there was a latch in the wire rim of each lens so that Dal could insert ants and grains of food into the spaces and thus watch the world with the insects ' teeming , potentially maddening , motions superimposed on it . Dal had a genius for looking at things differently . // Salvador Dal : The Persistence of Memory , 1931 , oil on canvas , 9 by 13 inches . Museum of Modern Art , New York . Digital image c MOMA/licensed by SCALA/Art Resource , New York . // Considering his annual sojourns in New York City , by all rights the centennial retrospective of his works ( currently on view at the Philadelphia Museum of Art ) might well have been presented at the Museum of Modern Art , but the complex opening of its renovated and much-expanded building understandably precluded that possibility . Addressing himself audaciously to wideranging activities in filmmaking , art criticism , window display , cartooning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production ) and what today would be called performance , no less than to painting , sculpture and graphics , Dal in the 1930s personified the international , open-ended , anything-goes outlook so successfully institutionalized by the Modern . Indeed , beginning with the acquisition in 1934 of The Persistence of Memory ( 1931 ) , and culminating in the touring retrospective inaugurated in New York in mid-November 1941 , the museum helped establish Dal 's celebrity as a modern master , a reputation unlikely to diminish for his vast audience , now including many indifferent to museum art and art history . But by 1941 Dal 's standing among contemporary art-world professionals had badly deteriorated . Breton , Surrealism 's leader and a past master of character assassination , claimed in the final ( May 1939 ) issue of Minotaure that Dal was a self-confessed racist , and Dal chose not to respond.1 A small exhibition of Surrealist painting presented in March 1941 at New York 's New School for Social Research without any work by Dal included a garbage can with his name on it.2 At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dal only increased . For example , the Apr. 7 , 1941 , issue of Life included a richly illustrated feature about his stay at the Virginia country house of socialite publisher Caresse Crosby , where he was completing his autobiography . But coverage in such widecirculation national magazines as Fortune , Time and Vogue hardly impressed Monroe Wheeler , the Modern 's director of exhibitions and publications , whose 1941 catalogue preface for the museum 's own Dal retrospective was unprecedented in its negativism : " Dal 's lack of dignity , his instant appreciation of the sensibilities of the press , are indication of the timeliness of his mind , but go deeper than that . " 3 Indeed , in his autobiography , The Secret Life of Salvador Dal , published in 1942 , the artist turned his back on modern art styles , resolving henceforth to devote himself to the reassertion of the classical traditions of Renaissance and Baroque art . While he stressed that his decision was strictly apolitical , a bias against non-Western and modern art in favor of old master values inevitably aligned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalitarian regimes . The 1941 retrospective at the Modern did include Soft Construction with Boiled Beans : Premonition of Civil War ( 1936 , today in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art ) , which critic Robert Hughes recently compared favorably to Picasso 's Guernica : " Dal 's painting is modern art 's strongest testimony on the Civil War in Spain , and on war in general . " 4 But Dal 's slightly later antiwar masterpiece-Visage of War ( 1940-41 , Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum , Rotterdam ) - was mysteriously omitted from the 1941 Modern exhibition , even though Dal reproduced it among his images of " Exorcism " in The Secret Life , with the caption , " the eyes stuffed with infinite death . " Disembodied in the desert near what appears to be a fossil of a human hand , this hairless , gap-toothed , sun-blackened head tormented by vipers could hardly have been more topical in November 1941 , with war raging in North Africa . Indeed , the Renaissance-rooted anti-modern style that Dal developed during World War II should rightly be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern science . In his Unspeakable Confessions ( 1973 ) , Dal explained that after the destruction of Hiroshima on Aug. 6 , 1945 , the atom became his favorite " food for thought . " 5 Hughes 's recognition of Dal 's capacity to express the dehumanization of war might well be extended to Atomic Idyll and Melancholic Uranium ( 1945 ) , painted in response to the atom bombing of Japan . It shows the inside of a dugout bunker , the partly collapsed roof providing a glimpse outside , where a winged apparition beckons a cavalry of ghost elephant mutants on long legs . ( Based on a 1647 Bernini monument , Dal 's elephants were in turn the inspiration for the Imperial AT-AT walkers in George Lucas 's film The Empire Strikes Back , 1980 . ) Inside the bunker both time and matter are reshaped , as interpenetrating gold and leaden nuclear particles initiate a verbal-visual free association between aerial bombardment and baseball .

Would it not have been more surprising if , with World War II , Dal had not changed his art ? // Soft Construction with Boiled Beans ( Premonitions of Civil War ) . 1936 , oil on cam-as , 39 7/8 by 39 3/8 inches .

Salvador Dal Museum , St. Petersburg , Fla. // Nonconformist extraordinaire , after his rupture with the modern art establishment no less than before , Dali took it as his fundamental intellectual responsibility to irritate and transgress , exuberantly and unrepentantly . With his unrelenting eccentric self-spoofing antics , his countless commercial-art and fashion projects , and his often blatantly Catholic late works , structured as intricate diagrams in sacred homage to newly discovered invisible truths of physics and biology , it was Dal 's manifest intention during the second half of his career to distance himself decisively from the anti-academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art world , which , for its part , wanted nothing to do with him . Even so , today fans line up at Dal museums in St. Petersburg , Fla. , and in Figueres , Spain , and despite the lack of any particular connection between the Spanish master and Prague , in May 2004 , with the expectation that loans could be negotiated in perpetuity , plans were proposed for a permanent Dal museum there , with a " destination " building to be designed by Daniel Libeskind . Nevertheless , for some prestigious museums Dal 's appeal is evidently still far from irresistible . // The Eye , set design for the film Spellbound , 1945 , oil on canvas , 23 by 33 inches . Private collection . // I first heard about plans for a centennial Dal retrospective in 1998 from Marshall Rousseau , the now retired director of the Salvador Dal Museum in St. Petersburg . It was thanks greatly to Rousseau that this museum 's founders , Eleanor and Reynolds Morse , who assembled the finest collection anywhere of Dal 's greatest works , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners with other museums of this country and abroad . Not long after the artist 's 1970 press conference in Paris ( at the exemplary Gustave Moreau Museum ) to announce his intention to create his own extraordinary Teatre-Museu Dal in his hometown of Figueres ( finally inaugurated in 1974 ) , the Morses founded their Salvador Dal Museum in Beachwood , Ohio , in 1971 ( relocating to Florida in 1982 ) . In consultation with each other about how jointly to assure the greatest success for the centennial of the artist 's birth , these two Dal museums , with the bulk of his work between them , resolved to make their resources available for a great international retrospective to be presented in the cities most closely associated with Dal 's career : Barcelona , Paris , London and New York . It was Rousseau 's responsibility to contact possible American museum venues , starting with MOMA . Learning of the MOMA scheduling conflict , he proposed the project to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , where the important exhibition " Salvador Dal : The Early Years " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metropolitan has as good or better Dal holdings than the Modern . The centennial issue notwithstanding , the Metropolitan decided that it was too soon to host another Dal exhibition . As for the Guggenheim Museum , Rousseau was unable to arrange a meeting with anyone there . Meanwhile , failing to interest museums in Paris and London , the Fundaci Gala-Salvador Dal ( which now operates the Teatre-Museu ) decided by the end of 1999 , for financial reasons , to present the centennial retrospective in Venice as the finale for the Palazzo Grassi 's acclaimed exhibition program and to help develop an alternative project on the theme of Dal and popular culture to present in Spain to mark the anniversary year . Not surprisingly , the Fundaci 's decision greatly disappointed many Dal enthusiasts in Spain , who felt strongly that the retrospective deserved to be seen in his homeland . As for the St. Petersburg Dal Museum , its leadership , considering an American museum presentation to be imperative , was dismayed by the Palazzo Grassi 's longstanding policy not to permit its shows to travel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to obtain a definite commitment from the Art Institute of Chicago , but to no avail . It was not until late 2001 that he finally found a willing partner in the Philadelphia Museum of Art . While Dal had no significant connection with the city of Philadelphia , he had been an especially close friend of Marcel Duchamp beginning in the mid-1930s . Since the Philadelphia Museum famously conserves the bulk of Duchamp 's art , it was thought that a Dal exhibition there would doubtless direct attention to this key , if till now understudied , dialogue in the history of 20th-century art . The Philadelphia show , as well as the Dal-Duchamp relationship , will be the subject of Part 2 of this article , to appear in a forthcoming issue. // Right , Bryans Hosiery ad , published in Vogue magazine , Sept. 1 , 1945 , printed paper , 12 by 9 inches .

( Consider the opportunities Dal 's work could furnish for museum-shop products ! 6 ) It has already been 40 years since an ambitious Dal retrospective was presented in the U.S. , at New York 's short-lived Gallery of Modern Art ( formerly the Huntington Hartford Museum ) on Columbus Circle . The Morses ' longstanding policy not to lend to museum shows made it difficult to arrange a comprehensive Dal exhibition after 1966 . But despite that serious limitation , in Europe retrospectives were organized for Paris and London ( 1978-80 ) , Madrid and Barcelona ( 1983 ) , and Stuttgart ( 1989 ) . Have American museums ignored Dal for so long on the grounds that he forever discredited himself as a fine artist by constantly and willingly putting his talents at the service of advertising campaigns , or by too frequently appearing publicly in the slapstick spirit of his favorite films stars , Buster Keaton and Harpo Marx ? The fundamental humanity of humor notwithstanding , comedy is still often greeted with suspicion in museum art , and Dal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily misunderstood as a mockery of learning and culture . But with such major museums as MOMA broadly reconsidering 20th-century art from the historical perspective of a new millennium , surely it is time to ask why Dal has been effectively blackballed for transgressions against conventional taste , when other artists ' disregard for similar rules earned them special consideration . Given his astonishing capacity for vulgarity , it seems incredible , for example , that Dal goes unmentioned in the ambitious catalogue to the Museum of Modern Art 's controversial 1990 exhibition " High &; Low : Modern Art and Popular Culture . " Should the omission be understood as an oversight , or was it intended to imply that Dal 's " low " is beneath consideration ?

While the stimulating literature of psychoanalysis prompted Dal and his Surrealist colleagues to address pathological behavior and sexuality in myriad unprecedented ways , as if to test the limits of his most liberated colleagues ' open-mindedness , Dal intentionally emphasized the most embarrassing human acts , in particular masturbation and defecation . In closing the valuable symposium " Persistence and Memory : New Critical Perspectives on Dal at the Centennial " ( convened Mar. 18-20 , 2004 ) at the Florida Dal museum , current director Hank Hine joked about how , according to municipal officials in attendance , the word " masturbator " had never been used so often in St. Petersburg during any previous three-day period .

But James Rosenquist , who likewise had been a Dal guest at the St. Regis , made the most valuable contribution , more than once stressing the obvious : " I love what he could do with a sable brush . " Considered together in the broadest terms , several similar conferences held recently suggest how widespread serious DaIi studies are today , extending ever more frequently into investigations of his post-1942 art . " While a few scholars continue to dwell on Dali 's vulgarity and an alleged failure to fulfill the promise of his classic 1930s works , the overwhelming trend is to take Dali 's later phases more seriously , to stress his high-mindedness ; his sophisticated responses to , among others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson and Crick ; and his meditations beyond the full range of visual arts to psychosexual theory , philosophy , nuclear physics , genetics , art history and literature of nearly every genre . I was thrilled to hear Barcelona journalist and independent scholar Ricardo Mas proclaim at the Florida symposium his opinion that Dali 's The secret Life deserves recognition as one of the greatest autobiographical texts in the history of literature.8 Sadly , I missed " Dal , Elective Affinities , " the brilliant exhibition arranged by Filar Parcerisas ( one of the Florida speakers ) for presentation in Barcelona ( Palau Moja , Feb. 20-Apr. 18 , 2004 ) to bring together the principal literary and artistic sources related to the artist 's famous ( if cryptically named ) paranoiac-critical method of perceiving multiple overlapping images simultaneously in a single visual frame .

Fundaci Gala-Salvador Dal . // Great fun to be sure , " Dal and Mass Culture " was problematic in concept . To begin with , the fact that its tour coincides with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key works from one or the other , weakening both . Most debatable in this respect was the decision to include Dal 's works with political and World War II overtones in " Dal and Mass Culture , " rather than in the retrospective , where they would have provided essential insights into the artist 's expanding mission . Take a work such as Baby Map of the World ( 19:39 ) . While the transformative overpainting of a sentimental chromolithograph is the basis for the piece ( hence its relationship to mass culture ) , far more significantly , the final image ranks among Dali 's most extreme and perverse ideas for object sculptures , incorporating the head of a blond child as a desktop globe of the world . Moreover , the paranoiac-critical revelation of the map of Africa , erupted on the child 's milky cheek as the double image of some unwholesome rash , brings to mind Breton 's worries about Dal 's possible racism in the late 1930s . In general " Dal and Mass Culture " misses its target whenever it fails to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against orthodox modernist taste-otherwise , why , as part of the centennial celebration of Dal 's artistic achievement , stress the very aspects of his career that have most served to discredit him ? Where Dal is concerned , the mass-culture topic is simply too large for a single exhibition . Most of the seven different sections of " Dal and Mass Culture " would benefit from being treated as separate , more diligently explicated exhibitions . Indeed , the material in the Dream of Venus section was recently the subject of just such a show.9 Although it would challenge conventional modes of installation and publication , a truly detailed exhibition of Dal 's film and theatre work would be most welcome , especially with the recent release of the Criterion Collection DVD of Alfred Hitchcock 's Spellbound , which includes several sequences designed by Dal , and the theatrical release of a posthumously reconstructed version based on the original Dal sketches of Destino , his unrealized 1946 animation project for the Walt Disney Studios . A good indication of what an exhibition devoted to Dal and film might yield can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mass Culture " catalogue by Jean-Michel Bonhours about the advertising imagery in Un Chien andalou and L'Age d'or . Full catalogue entries with the sort of detailed information provided by Bonhours would have greatly improved the " Dal and Mass Culture " publication . Without them , it is sometimes not clear exactly why the organizers bothered to include particular items . There is , for example , scarcely any commentary about Dali 's graphically complex advertisements for Bryans Hosiery , and the tiny color reproductions of 11 of them , welcome as they are , seem to imply that these ambitious drawings have little significance as art . It would perhaps have helped Dali 's case to include a reference to de Kooning 's acclaimed pre-Pop manipulation of magazine advertisements , as well as Lichtenstein 's parallel efforts a couple of years later . And surely , specific mention of Warhol should be made in connection with the giveaway printed newspapers Dal produced for his 1945 and 1947 New York exhibitions . To its credit , the catalogue does note how Dal 's 1943 painting The Poetry of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very like a Rauschenberg assemblage , including a shadow-casting Coca-Cola bottle hanging by a string as part of a ballet costume.10 With this detail , The Poetry of America might easily have been a centerpiece for a section on Dal and food . This would range from his 1930s concept of " cannibalism " ( with his figures ingesting themselves and one another ) to his opulent 1973 cookbook Les Dners de Gala , with 12 capricious illustrations based on chromolithographs Etienne Ronjat included in Jules Gouffe 's classic Le Livre de cuisine ( 1867 ) . Moreover , with its armless figures wearing cheerleader pompons and old-fashioned gridiron helmets , ne Poetry of America could also have been a highlight in a section devoted to Dal and sports , a longtime interest of his that culminated in The Hallucinogenic Toreador ( 1969-70 ) , a major work which , in its complexity and quality , rivals many better-known paintings by other artists of the period .

Fundacio Gala-Salrador Dal . // In keeping with his sense for multifaceted truths expressed with multiple superimposed images , Dal always had things both ways ( at least ) , unconcerned with contradiction or hypocrisy . He wanted to be a leading avant-garde theoretician and still venerate popular academic artists such as Ernest Meissonier , whose carefully premeditated works exemplified slavish conventionality for arch-modernists . So Dal 's endorsement of mass culture inevitably coincides with a fervent appreciation of elite culture . In the spirit of modern-dress productions of classic plays and operas , The Poetry of America merges ballet and American football . The Sacred Heart ( 1929 ) may refer to inexpensive chromolithographs , but it also makes a more high-culture allusion to the modern literature of memory . Considering Dali 's lifelong admiration for the writings of Marcel Proust , the blasphemous inscription in the painting ( " sometimes I spit for fun on my mother 's portrait " ) must be understood in relationship to the shocking episode in Stt'ann 's Way ( 1913 ) when , to arouse the orphan daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph . " Dal 's interest in furniture ( touched on in the film section of " Dal and Mass Culture " ) seems to deserve more serious attention as well . Isolated pieces of furniture-a night table , a bed-on occasion play leading roles in some of his most mysterious paintings , ostensibly about waiting , for example the mirage image in Sun Table ( 1936 ) or Surrealist Composition with Invisible Figures ( ca. 1936 ) , the latter one of the Fundaio 's notable recent acquisitions . In the summer of 1935 , Pierre and Teeny Matisse took Wadsworth Atheneum director Chick Austin to a gallery in Paris ( likely Jean-Michel Frank 's shop at 140 rue Faubourg-Saint-Honor ) to see furniture by Christian Brard , Alberto Giacometti and Dali.1- What did the visitors see there ? Did Dal ever realize prototypes for any of the the futuristic furnishings depicted in his ca. 1937 oil Singularities ?

They Will Quiver and Shake at the Sign of Danger , and Caress the Oncomer If Joy or Good Fortune Waits Within . " And what about Dali 's double image of a room inspired by the face of Mae West , with the curtains formed by her hair and the famous Lips sofa ? Was it inspired by the display in London in 1936 of the film actress 's bed in the Homes of the Stars section of the " Ideal Home Exhibition " ? 13 The " Dal and Mass Culture " catalogue explains p. 141 that in 1936 Dal provided a Lips sofa , as well as a stuffed bear with drawers in its back , for Eisa Schiaparelli 's Place Vendme shop in Paris , but , sadly , no photographs of these items are included in its pages . It was only when I arrived at the Teatre-Museu in Figueres ( which features a full-scale room realized in the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on her lips ) that I grasped the scope of Dal 's decorative genius . With its geodesic dome , its cornice of giant eggs ( added with the annexation of the so-called Torre Galatea in 1983 ) and its plaza spotted with capricious sculptures , this immensely popular museum ( among Spanish museums , only the Prado gets more visitors ) fulfills Dali 's labyrinthine fun-park concept of architecture , envisioned already in his 1937 drawing for the American Weekly predicting the future style for buildings . Although never mentioned in recent discussions of destination-museum architecture , in surprising ways Dali 's museum in Figueres foreshadows Frank Gehry 's flamboyant design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.14 But the Teatre-Museu is rather more than architecture . It could be better described as a sublime plastic exercise in autobiography and the persistence of memory . While in the manner of a conventional museum it houses Dal 's extensive holdings of his own art ( as well as other artists ' works in his modest but idiosyncratic collection ) , as architecture the Teatre-Museu is tantamount to a giant " found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater ( destroyed during the Spanish Civil War ) where Dal first showed his art as a teenager . Moreover , the Teatre-Museu was designed to showcase new , expanded versions of works ( enlarged versions , in fact , of key pieces such as The Rainy Taxi , 1938 ) from throughout his career , thus providing some sort of permanent retrospective exhibition for his hometown . Considered as a whole , the Teatre-Museu is an enormous installation piece with thousands of interrelated details , possibly the century 's most complex work of visual art . Palatial in scope , the Teatre-Museu ought to be understood in relationship to Duchamp 's famous retrospective in miniature of original reproductions , the Bote-en-Valise , an example of which is on display with other objects in Dal 's collection . // The Hallucinogenic Toreador , 1969-70 , oil on canvas , 157 by 118 inches , Salvador Dal Museum .

That decision alienated several of Dali 's closest associates , in particular Enrique Sabater , the artist 's secretary from 1974 to 1981 , and his successor , Robert Descharnes , the photographer with whom Dal had collaborated on many projects since the early 1950s .

While Descharnes and his son continue to contribute to Dal studies , " ' they were excluded from the centennial events and , except for the listings of their publications in bibliographies , their names are generally omitted in publications sponsored by the Fundacio . The revenue-minded policies of the Fundacio have nevertheless made possible many worthy achievements . To begin with , since 1991 , the Fundacio has added well over 100 Dal works to the museum 's collection .

I would like to thank the following individuals for their help with information and insights : Montse Ayuer , Timothy Baum , Haim Finkelstein , William Jeffett , Jean John , Lewis Kachur , Elizabeth Kley , Ricard Max , Gerald Nordland , Imma Parada , Pilar Parcerisas , Pascual Pesudo and Marshall Rousseau .

Sidebar Long disdained by art-world professionals for his unabashed commercialism and sensationalistic pictorial style , Salvador Dal has lately begun to receive the kind of scholarly attention that only a full-blown 20th-century master can command . Sidebar Among Dal 's most extreme and perverse ideas for object sculptures is the image of a blonde child 's head made into a desktop globe of the world . Sidebar Dal 's 1943 " The Poetry of America " eerily anticipates Pop art , even including a shadow-casting Coca-Cola bottle as part of a ballet costume . Sidebar The Teatre-Museu Dal features a full-scale room in the image of Mae West 's head , scaled to the famous sofa modeled after her lips . Sidebar The Renaissance-rooted anti-modern style that Dal developed during the 1940s was a response to the war and to advances in modern science . Reference 1 .

As far as I know , there is no remaining record of the so-called " Surrealist Game " exhibited by Dal during his solo exhibition at M. Knoedler and Company , New York Apr. 14-May 5 , 1948 , with the title " Coca cola , coca cola , coca cola !
