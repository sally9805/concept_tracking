The biggest sales boom in Boeing ' s cyclical history of making commercial passenger jets has come to a screeching halt . <p> After selling 4,134 planes the past four years , Boeing Commercial Airplanes , the company 's jetliner division , is racking up more cancellations than orders for new planes this year . Industry analysts warn that more cancellations may be in the offing as people are flying less in the global recession . <p> But top executives at Boeing , the USA 's largest exporter by value of goods sold abroad , remain publicly confident . They 've announced only 4,500 job cuts so far  --  far fewer than the roughly 30,000 laid off after the downturn in travel following the Sept. 11 terror attacks . And none of the cuts are on the assembly line . <p> They 're betting on two things to keep production humming for years : the company 's staggering $270 billion backlog of orders ; and belief that the 30-year trend of growing demand for air travel will continue beyond the current downturn . <p> At current production rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver the nearly 3,700 jetliners on backlog , says Randy Tinseth , the company 's marketing vice president . <p> " We 've clearly got a much larger backlog than we 've ever had in previous cycles , " Tinseth says . " That gives us flexibility as we go through this downturn . " <p> Scott Carson , CEO of the commercial airplanes division , told investors at the JPMorgan Chase conference in New York earlier this month that over the next 20 years the market " is a rich opportunity for us , " whether the ultimate demand for commercial jets is 29,000 planes , as Boeing projects , or just 27,000 if cancellations continue . <p> " We 're playing from a position of strength , " he said . <p> Are Boeing ' s leaders just whistling past the graveyard by believing that economic forces that have engulfed many large and successful companies in the past six months wo n't ensnare the manufacturing giant ? <p> Richard Aboulafia thinks so . " Yes , Boeing has a record backlog , but only a fool would believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax , Va . <p> If airlines in the USA and around the world are flattened financially by severe recession and deeply diminished demand , they will not hesitate to forfeit down payments and walk away from so-called firm orders for new planes , he says . Even if carriers negotiate delivery deferrals rather than cancellations , Boeing wo n't get hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years that it expects to be paid upon completion of those planes , he says . <p> Boeing will start feeling the pinch in 2010 , Aboulafia predicts . He says financing is available for all the planes that Boeing and its chief rival , Europe 's Airbus , plan to deliver to the airlines this year . " But after that , " he says , " all bets are off . In a serious downturn  --  and this certainly is one  --  production typically falls by about a third . I ca n't see why in this downturn it would be different . " <p> Others much less confident <p> Others are more pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered his rating on Boeing in January , warning that the company " is underestimating the potential for lower airline demand . " <p> Joseph Nadol at JPMorgan last week cut his earnings estimates for Boeing and Airbus for this year and next . In addition to rapidly weakening demand for passenger planes , Nadol said , the cargo version of Boeing ' s 777 is in particular trouble because air freight volumes have " collapsed " by 25% from a year ago . <p> Giovanni Bisignani , head of the International Air Transport Association , the airlines global trade group , warned last month that Boeing and Airbus might not be able to deliver up to half the commercial planes they build this year . In Boeing ' s case , that would be about 240 of the 485 planes it is scheduled to deliver . Bisignani said he based his prediction on conversations with several airline CEOs who told him they ca n't afford to pay for the new planes . <p> Even more chilling was the warning shot fired last month by Steven Udvar-Hazy , head of International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplanes and the largest single customer of both Boeing and Airbus . Speaking with reporters at a Boeing media event in Seattle , he predicted that both airplane makers will be producing " white tails " by the end of this year . " White tails " are planes completed without a buyer , so they have no logo on their tails . <p> Chris Tarry , an independent industry analyst and consultant based outside London , estimates that 1,600 to 1,800 already-ordered Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s , both of which carry about 150 passengers , are in danger of not being delivered over the next three to 10 years . " ( Airlines ) simply do n't need them , " he says . <p> If there 's anything Boeing understands , it 's the wildly cyclical nature of the aviation business . Past downturns have led to massive layoffs , regional economic upheaval and larger U.S. trade deficits . <p> Boeing officials believe they can avoid most of that pain this time by better managing production . <p> Carson told investors at the JPMorgan Chase conference that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow production of planes scheduled for delivery in the last half of 2010 . Planes to be delivered then would go into production early next year . Suppliers need about six months advance notice of a change . <p> " There 's lots of uncertainty in 2010 , " Tinseth , Boeing ' s marketer , admits . " That 's why I 'm trying to sell some additional planes in the back half of 2010 in expectation that there 'll be some ' melt-away from our backlog , through deferrals mainly . <p> " But we 've been pretty successful in managing our business the last few years during our biggest sales boom ever . We 've been very measured in our approach to increasing production rates . We 're not producing planes at nearly the rate we did in the past , and that should keep us pretty healthy during the downturn . " <p> There are other danger signs , however . <p> In the first two months of this year , Boeing sold only 22 new planes , down from 195 in the same period last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new 787 Dreamliner canceled in February . The roughly $1.75 billion or so that Boeing will get from the new model 737 and 77 planes it sold in January and February wo n't come close to offsetting the nearly $5.5 billion it is losing from the cancellation of the 787s . Each 787 is priced around $170 million . <p> Much of Boeing ' s fortunes depend on whether the airlines have access to capital . <p> Airlines with good credit are going to pay more for borrowing in this economic climate , industry analyst Tarry says . " Carriers that are n't very creditworthy , and that 's a lot of them , " he says , " wo n't be able to accept delivery of planes they 've already ordered and certainly wo n't order more . " <p> That 's left Boeing as the financier of last resort for some of the planes it builds . <p> Continental , arguably the top performer financially among traditional U.S. airlines and a top Boeing customer , has 13 new aircraft coming this year . Only six are financed so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline has " backstop " financing from Boeing for the other seven and will draw on that if necessary . Finding less-expensive capital wo n't be easy . <p> " Some lenders have just gotten out of the business of lending against airplanes , " says John Pritchard , an attorney at Holland &amp; Knight in New York who specializes in aircraft finance arrangements . " But the ( loan ) terms have gotten a lot tougher , " he says . <p> Southwest Airlines , which flies only Boeing planes and is the best credit risk among U.S. carriers because of its strong balance sheet , recently trumpeted that in December it was able to refinance 17 late-model 737s at 10.5% interest on a three-year note secured by the aircraft . Just a year earlier , it refinanced several planes at 3.6% interest on an eight-year , unsecured note . <p> " It just reflects that the market has gotten so bad that even a good lending customer like Southwest could run into that kind of trouble getting financing , " Pritchard says . <p> Other loans available <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending arm , is expecting to make $1 billion in credit available to customers this year after not extending any the last three years . <p> The French government , a shareholder in Airbus parent EADS  --  European Aeronautic Defence and Space  --  is making more than $6 billion available to airlines buying or leasing Airbus planes . <p> Free-trade advocates may decry government financing as an intervention in the market , but the United States does much the same thing for Boeing ' s foreign customers via the U.S. Export-Import Bank . <p> Last year , the Export-Import Bank backed $5.5 billon in aircraft loans on 97 Boeing - built planes sold to 17 airlines and two leasing companies outside the USA . <p> Robert Morin , head of the bank 's transportation lending group , expects 2009 to be a record year , with $7 billion to $9 billion in loan guarantees issued to foreign carriers and leasing companies . About 90% of the planes Boeing expects to deliver this year are destined for companies outside the USA . <p> Morin says he 's hopeful that bank-supported aircraft leasing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the market . <p> Though it 's too early to call it a trend , Morin says , commercial lending on airplanes picked up a bit in the current quarter after extraordinarily tight lending at the end of last year driven by the global liquidity crisis .
