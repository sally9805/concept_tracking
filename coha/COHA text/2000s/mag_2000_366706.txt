In 1926 a young lawyer paused in his clerking at a West Palm Beach , Fla. , firm to listen to some radio music floating on the sultry air . When he recognized the song , Washboard Blues , as one he had written , Hoagland Howard Carmichael forgot about the bar and set about becoming the old music master . <P> It was a smart choice . Within a few years , he had written the songs that made his reputation  --  instant standards like Star Dust , Lazy River , Georgia on My Mind that insinuated themselves into the universal ear and made a home there . Hoagy recorded these jazzy ballads and boppers in classic sessions with some decent sidemen : Bix Beiderbecke ( his idol ) , Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey , Louis Armstrong , Benny Goodman , Spike Jones . At a time when the tag " singer-songwriter " was about as common as " lady surgeon , " Carmichael 's warm , croaking delivery often vaulted him up the charts ; he had three of the four top discs of 1946 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano player  --  made him a natural for films ( To Have and Have Not , The Best Years of Our Lives ) and radio and TV hosting . In the great age of the pop composer , he was the one everybody knew and liked . Maybe they did n't know how elegantly complex his musicianship was , though they heard it in the long , loping lines of Skylark , soaring with sorrow , and in the verse to Star Dust , so gorgeous on its own that Frank Sinatra once recorded it without the famous chorus . <P> His tunes never disappeared . They have been covered by Ella and Ellington , Ethel Waters and Willie Nelson , John Coltrane and Jan and Dean . Ray Charles still ca n't get offstage without singing Georgia . If you do n't hear Heart and Soul when your kid sits at the piano , you can catch it in a Quaker Oats TV spot . <P> But lately the composer has been getting the full revival treatment .

Music by Hoagy Carmichael ( Peermusic ) features 25 cuts with some rococo gems , like George Harrison 's opium-scented Hong Kong Blues and Chet Baker 's fabulously androgynous vocals on I Get Along Without You Very Well . Another disc , Crystal Gayle 's The Heart and Soul of Hoagy Carmichael ( Platinum ) , is a lavish , meticulous set with the rarely performed verses to many of the songs . <P> Best of all , The Hoagy Carmichael Centennial Celebration brings the music back to life onstage . The narrated concert , with Tom Fay 's solid 14-piece band and seven singers , has played sold-out venues across the country , climaxing this week in Manhattan . At the end of a recent gig near Pittsburgh , Pa. , the packed house of 1,500 crooned dreamily along to Star Dust : " leaving me a song that will not die . " The old music master left dozens of those deathless ditties . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
