How the vision of one independent bookseller has revitalized the heart of Faulkner 's Mississippi . <p> A photograph of Oxford , Mississippi , catches the town on the gloomiest day in its postwar history . It shows the courthouse square , Oxford 's literal and symbolic heart . A couple of young white men , facing away from the camera , are hurling glass bottles at some unseen target ; around them , others mill about , gazing in the direction taken by the missiles . <p> This was a moment in the 1962 riot aimed at preventing James Meredith from registering at the University of Mississippi . The riot itself , one of the more traumatic incidents in the long march toward desegregation in the South , had occurred on the Ole Miss campus , almost a mile away , where two people were killed and scores wounded . Afterward , federal troops pushed the crowd into town , where its more hotheaded members harried the soldiers . In the background of the photograph , you can see Blaylock 's Drug Store , with its oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang , incongruously , over the heads of the bottle throwers . <p> It is startling to see the photograph these days  --  you might have come across it in the January/February 2000 issue of The Oxford American  --  because of how much is still recognizable , and how much has changed . The square looks the same : You can stand where those rioters stood , and instantly identify both the ornate commercial facade of the building in front of you , and the Fortune 's sign . But the business inside is no longer Blaylock 's . It is now a bookstore . And if over the last decade Oxford has become a signal destination for travelers to the Deep South , having overcome the trauma of the 1962 riots and what outsiders mistakenly took them to mean about the town , that would be in some measure due to that store , Square Books , and its owner , Richard Howorth . <p> Howorth is perhaps best known these days as the president of the American Booksellers Association ( ABA ) , the scrappy organization of independent bookstores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sweeping them into the dustbin of history . Tall , bespectacled , and , on the surface , disarmingly earnest  --  " Richard looks like your algebra teacher " is how one young novelist puts it-he is also fervid about his cause . During Howorth 's tenure , which ends in June , the ABA helped deep-six the proposed merger between Barnes &; Noble and Ingram , the national book distributor ; pursued a lawsuit by a group of its members against Barnes &; Noble and Borders Books for seeking and receiving unfair terms from publishers and distributors ; and undertook an ambitious  --  and so far unrealized  --  effort to unify some 1,200 independent bookstores through a bookselling website . <p> The ABA has gotten a fair amount of sympathetic publicity for all of this . For those who value books and writing , the difficulties faced by the independent bookstores are troubling , and not just because they 're pleasant places . As Howorth puts it , " When the independent bookselling market was thriving in the ' 70s and ' 80s , more books were being published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books were higher , and publishers ' profit margins were much greater . With the rise of the corporate retailing powers and the consolidation in publishing , all of those things have declined . " At their best , independents play a bedrock role in sustaining the village of readers and writers , bringing the one together with the other and esteeming the thoughts , tastes , and quirks of both . But what tends to get lost in the arguments over the future of retailing is that independents do n't just belong to that fanciful village ; they belong to real towns and cities , too . The dangers posed to them by superstores and online sellers do n't just threaten some quaint form of distributing goods , they imperil the fabric of neighborhoods and towns . For good or ill , stores-their bearing on the street , the people they draw in , the presence they east in the community at large  --  help define their neighborhoods , which is why the changes buffeting traditional retailers are not solely fodder for the business pages . As Oxford 's experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , and of the places we choose to live , is up for grabs as well . <p> Of all the faint ripples cast by the events caught in that 1962 photograph , Square Books must be one of the least likely . Howorth , now 49 , was 11 at the time , and he remembers his mother 's anguish upon reading about the riots ( his family was living in Memphis , though it moved to Oxford the following year ) . Howorth 's mother had grown up in Oxford , the daughter and granddaughter of Ole Miss professors , and most of her family was still there . " She knew , " Howorth says , " that it meant ruin for the town and the university . " Oxford and its environs were hardly free of the cramped assumptions about race that marked the rest of Mississippi  --  this was , after all , the community that William Faulkner wrote about  --  but the townspeople also felt a deep faith in it , a sense that Oxford was both of and apart from the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could begin to escape the ancestral shackles of their culture . <p> " There was a shared belief that one of these days , it would be a great university and great community , " Howorth says , " which was my parents ' view and came to be my own view . " But the riots shook Oxford 's idea of itself . " We reached bottom , commercially and emotionally , with the Meredith riot , " says Will Lewis , who co-owns Neilson 's department store , which has anchored the square since 1839 . <p> And so in 1979 , when Howorth and his wife , Lisa , left their apprenticeship as managers of the Savile Book Shop in Washington , D.C. , and returned to Oxford to open their own store , they had more in mind than simply serving a market for good literature that  --  curiously , for Faulkner 's hometown-had until then gone largely unserved . They also wanted the store to help Oxford cast itself in a different light , as a place of culture and literacy and broad-mindedness . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been wrongly viewed so many times , at so many different historic junctures , and that maybe this will help compensate . " <p> Square Books was born on the second floor of a building owned by Howorth 's aunt , next to Nellson 's , with $10,000 that Richard and Lisa had saved , and another $10,000 borrowed from the bank next to where the bookstore now sits . It was not an instant success  --  in fact , Lisa had to get a job at the university library , since one of them needed to bring in some income  --  but their business quickly made an impact . " It was a bookstore , so it was a cultural focal point , " says Tom Freeland , a local lawyer . " It was certainly the first cultural focal point that was n't university connected . " And even the university had n't paid much attention to writers other than Faulkner , so when Square Books began holding readings and signings-including a jammed , electrifying event in 1980 with Willie Morris , who was teaching at Ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sophie 's Choice  --  it became clear that here was a force capable of transforming Oxford 's cultural life . <p> As it happened , the Howorths had arrived in town at about the same time as a young Yale professor , William Ferris , who had come to set up the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at Ole Miss . The three became friends and allies . The bookstore promoted the center 's work and the writers and scholars it attracted . Eventually , Square Books joined forces with the center to put on the Oxford Conference for the Book , a three-day gathering of writers , poets , editors , and publishers that since the early 1990s has helped cement Oxford 's reputation as a literary center of the South . For his part , Ferris , who is now chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities , helped Howorth bring in such writers as Alex Haley , Toni Morrison , Alice Walker , and Allen Ginsberg , not only adding to Square Books ' growing reputation as the engine of Oxford 's growing cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I saw it as part of my mission to support Square Books in everything it sought to do , ' Ferris explains . " At that time , our problem in Oxford was the increasingly insecure future of the square as an economic unit . And Square Books represented a small , modest investment in the future of the square . " <p> It is hard these days , when so much of the commercial life of our communities takes place in malls well outside the center of town , to understand just how deeply a town square can be embedded in the gut of a place . On one wall of the courthouse in Oxford is a plaque bearing Faulkner 's words from Requiem for a Nun , " Above all , the courthouse , the center , the focus , the hub sitting looming in the center of the county 's circumference , like a single cloud in the ring of the horizon . " The words are attached to the building , but Faulkner might as well have been writing about the square itself . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't just that the square was the center of commerce ; it was all of commerce . " It had a dry-goods store in every quadrant , drugstores , hardware stores ; even Oxford 's car dealerships and auto-parts supply stores sat just off it . On Saturdays , it was where everyone in town and in the surrounding county came to get a haircut , buy their produce from the farmers who set up their trucks around the courthouse , listen to preachers-white preachers in one corner , black in the other  --  and simply spend the day . It was , in short , the center of Oxford life . <p> As chain retailers and others began arriving in town , though , the square 's life began to ebb , as it did in most other Southern and Midwestern towns . Many of the merchants closed up or moved , though a few , like Will Lewis , made it clear they were n't budging . " If we 'd had to reach the point of moving " says Lewis , " I 'd just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't for me . " There were others like him , but even so , by the late 1960s it looked like the square 's best days were over . <p> Then two things happened . One was that Oxford passed liquor-by-the-drink ( Mississippi had been dry until the late 1960s ) , and bars , restaurants , and nightclubs began setting up around the square . The other was the arrival of Square Books . <p> No one in town , least of all Richard Howorth , would say the bookstore saved the square , but it certainly helped change the ambience of the town 's center , especially after Howorth bought the Blaylock 's building and renovated it . Square Books became a destination  --  a well-lighted , comfortable refuge on one of the square 's main corners where townspeople could meet . They thronged to readings and signings , and could hang out at the cafe upstairs  --  even the daily conclave of Oxford old-timers that has met for three decades at Smitty 's , the no-frills cafe just behind Square Books , will sometimes repair to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football fans in town for a game-and where they felt not just welcomed , but understood . " If I get interested in a subject , " says Tom Freeland , " I tend to read a lot of books on it . I 've sometimes felt there were sections expanding in the store , that Richard had picked up that I was interested in something and suddenly there 'd be a bunch more books on it . " <p> It is hard to pick apart the precise alchemy by which a bookseller turns good business practices into a vital community presence , but it is clear that in Square Books ' case , its success as a store is inseparable from its impact on Oxford . With its shelves crowded with books by Eudora Welty , Willie Morris , Walker Percy , Larry Brown , Barry Hannah , Richard Ford , John Grisham , Ellen Gilchrist , Donna Tartt , and other writers with a Mississippi connection , it 's a place where Mississippians can take instant pride in the state 's literary strengths . Howorth 's eclectic approach toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of readers can feel comfortable . " If people come in and they want a book by David Duke or even something like The Southern Dog ( a new book of photographs that Howorh recently ordered ) and I do n't have that book , or I appear to be condescending , then I do n't think those people should have much respect for me , " he says . Its readings and its weekly radio show featuring visiting authors and local musicians have made it a hometown cultural institution . And Howorth 's willingness to champion writers he or his staff admire has made the store a national literary magnet , a fact that gives the townspeople pride . " Square Books really is an anchor in the soul of Oxford , " says William Ferris . " If anything can be seen as the legacy of Faulkner and the wonderful literary traditions of the community , it 's the store " And so , with Square Books as a model and an anchor , others have followed : furniture sellers , restaurateurs , clothiers , a record store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place it was in Faulkner 's day  --  on the whole , its stores are too upscale for that now  --  but it is still the center of town , and it is still vibrant , night and day . " There 's always life here " says architect Tom Howorth , Richard 's younger brother . " Physically , the square has a wonderful scale , a sense of enclosure with abundant activity at the same time . One day I was looking out the window and saw John Berendt ( the author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil ) on one bench , and looked across and there goes Barry Hannah into the bookstore . So part of it is physical , part is that there are smart , interesting people that you might bump into on the street , and part of it is that there 's still this old-fashioned , county-courthouse culture going on " <p> Thanks in part to the ambience Square Books helped bring into being , the center of Oxford is a wonderful place , vital and at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world has taken notice . These days , a simple search can find a raft of travel articles about Oxford , all of which comment on its easy charm and cultural riches . Most of them prominently mention Square Books . The town is perennially on lists of desirable places to retire , with a reputation as " a surprisingly urbane and energetic place , " as the Chicago Tribune put it a few years back . " We wound up on everyone 's hot button , " says Max Hipp , the town chamber of commerce 's executive director . <p> And so Oxford has been growing , booming , in fact , at least by Southern small-town standards . Out on the edge of town new retail establishments are popping up at a dizzying pace . Real estate prices are climbing , nowhere more rapidly than around the square ; most of Howorth 's employees can no longer afford to live within walking distance of the store . Developers are scurrying to snap up available parcels , including sites just off the square that are slated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned grocery in town . It is possible to get quite gloomy about all of this . A while back , the town council created a historic preservation committee to look into what ought to be done about the courthouse square . When word got out that the committee was planning to recommend the creation of a historic preservation district around the square , thus shutting off development , Oxford 's property owners and developers besieged town hall . As a result , the council rescinded its preservation statute and disbanded the committee . People who like Oxford as it is fear the recent developments . " If growth is unrestricted and uncontrolled , " says Ferris , " it essentially destroys the very heart of the place that made people want to move there . " <p> This is pretty much where Howorth finds himself . " The town was built on a scale , " he says , " and for the first 150 years of its life , it existed at that scale . The store itself fit well within that scale . But that 's what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sort of in control of my destiny , and I had a hand in the destiny of the community . Now I 'm just not sure . The community 's becoming something different . " Still , it 's worth remembering that the community has been in the process of becoming something different for decades-indeed , as Tom Freeland points out , " You can find Faulkner writing letters to the editor of the Oxford Eagle about the decline of the square in the 1940s . " <p> Communities are constantly reinventing themselves ; sometimes they do it with grace and imagination , as Oxford has demonstrated with its courthouse square . So just as Square Books is , in a fashion , part of Oxford 's problem  --  having helped create the atmosphere that makes the town so attractive-it may also be part of the answer . Even now , Howorth has his eye on a piece of nearby property , into which he might move his main store , while keeping his current location to specialize in books about the South . Typically , he has mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of development , " he recently wrote to another bookseller , " I become what I fear . " But vital neighborhoods need vital stores to anchor them , and even a larger Square Books will still stand for the importance of ideas and reading and writing and lively discourse to a community 's quality of life . Even as Oxford becomes a busier , more crowded place , that 's an encouraging set of values to have sitting at its heart . <p> The trauma of the 1962 riot ( right ) over integration of the University of Mississippi shook the town of Oxford . <p> The immediacy of daily business on the courthouse square : Readers settled on a bench sample Square Books ' wares ( above ) , and a customer consults with Wiley Herbert-whose cobbler shop has been in the family since 1893  --  on choosing a shoe color . <p> At right : Oxford 's commerce is anchored by Smitty 's Cafe and Neilson 's , whose owner , Will Lewis , said , " Leaving the square was n't for me '  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have endorsed . <p> At left : In Square Books , Howorth-here penning an advertisement for an evening reading  --  takes a hands-on approach to serving his customers . <p> As Oxford changes , Richard Howorth ( above ) is looking to the town 's future and the possible expansion of his independent bookstore . <p> By Rob Gurwitt <p>
