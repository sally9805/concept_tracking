But interestingly , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial stirring is Is it okay to raise the mast ? " No guy wants to get an erection at an inappropriate time . This push-pull state of wanting to go with his desire and maybe needing to restrain it fuels his excitement , " says Kerner. * AS ONE GUY PUTS IT : " My girlfriend knows how to make me want her ... bad . Like recently , we were on our way to a club when I saw this little red thong poking out above her jeans . Suddenly I 'm all , Is she feeling sexy ? Did she do this to drive me nuts ? I was riled up ! " - Brian , 28 HIS BOD : As soon as your man 's mind switches over to sex , his body begins to prickle with anticipation . " His temperature starts to rise , and chemical messengers released into his bloodstream make his skin supersensitive , " explains Susan Kellogg , PhD , director of sexual medicine at the Pelvic and Sexual Health Institute of Philadelphia . Basically , every impulse in his body is focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder by the second down there . * AS ONE GUY PUTS IT : " When I first become aroused , any kind of touch sends shivers into my groin . Even my fiancee 's bare stomach and breasts pushed up against my torso drive me nuts . I swear it feels like someone 's pouring ice water down my back . " - Peter , 29 WORK IT TO THE MAX Tease him like crazy . " He 's at a stage when he 's half letting himself go and half holding back , so make him lose control , " says Kerner . " The male mind holds great power over his physical state , so the key now is to use teasing preplay moves that will make him ache for you . " So confess to a dirty dream you had about him or touch him in a sexual way-but in a nonsexual setting . Keep it light . Right now , the tiniest movements feel massive , which is why you should keep your caresses soft and unexpected . " Take advantage of his physically on-edge state by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes will hit next , " says sex expert AvaCadell , PhD . Run your nails down his torso , graze your lips across his clavicle , or lightly tap his tush . Stage 2 THE QUICK BANG BUILDUP HIS BRAIN : He 's now being pulled in two different new directions . He knows he should keep it slow and sensual to please you , but he 's desperate to devour you whole . " During this stage , guys oscillate between feelings of tenderness and raw animal instinct , " says Kerner . " They will often struggle to keep their focus on the woman because their physical cravings take over . " * AS ONE GUY PUTS IT : " I have to be honest : When things are getting hot and heavy and my woman wants soft kisses and baby talk , I get annoyed . It just saps the momentum . But I guess it 's also her way of bringing me back and saying , " Hello , I 'm here too , " because at that point , I just want to get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the physical changes taking place here : He responds to more intense touches because his pain threshold is increasing , his breathing quickens , and he 's fully erect . " The more turned on he becomes , the more he craves release , " explains Kerner . " And it 's during this stage of arousal that a man is desperate for intercourse , because that 's what will really drive his pleasure forward . " * AS ONE GUY PUTS IT : " Just before we start having sex , the anticipation of penetration takes me right to the edge . My body is full of tension , and I know relief is getting closer now . " - James , 32 WORK IT TO THE MAX Manage his changing needs . Show him that you feel the difference in intensity too . " Get a little rough with him . You almost have to act as lion tamer , allowing his passion to be both contained and provoked , " says Warren Farrell , PhD , author of Why Men Are the Way They Are . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard so while he 's physically restrained , your passionate lip-lock communicates desire , or clamp your thighs around his torso , letting just the tip of his penis enter you . Pay attention to his shoulder blades , spine , and butt . Before you let him enter the Promised Land , lightly scratch your nails over those areas . " The nerves near his spine and waist are directly connected to his package , so stimulating them has a tantalizing ripple effect , " says Kerner . Then flick his frenulum ( the tiny nob of flesh on the underside of his penis head ) with the flat of your tongue . " Sending that shock through his system just before he enters you will trigger a chain reaction of pleasure , " says Kerner . Stage 3 THE STAMINA STRETCH HIS BRAIN : Guys know this : If they want a mind-blowing finale , they have to go the distance . " So he 's casing up a little from that wild animal frenzy-he 's focused on enjoying sex , but not too much , " says Farrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head : " Switching gears mentally-possibly thinking of a nonsexual image-lets him hold back , " explains Farrell . " But as he talks himself down to last longer , he 'll sometimes have trouble getting back up to speed . " At this point , he may need to delve into a fantasy to reignite his arousal , and as a result , yon may feel like he 's zoned out . AS ONE GUY PUTS IT : " During sex , I have this one voice in my head saying " I want to come , I want to come . ' But then there 's this other voice saying , " Hold out ! She 'll think you 're lame if you lose your load too soon . ' Its mental warfare . " - Jim , 23 HIS BOD : " For men , variety is key during this phase , " says Kerner . " Physically , his pleasure is completely concentrated in a hot Ix-It around his lower hack , butt , and groin , with pleasure waves radiating out from this point . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to hold back from climaxing , men crave a series of different frictions , rhythms , and sensations in the stamina stretch . " By alternating positions and speed , you drive his excitement but still allow him to remain in control , " says Kerner . AS ONE GUY PUTS IT : 1 give my girl at least one orgasm early on because I know that once the sex gets going , my body is so juiced with testosterone that I can barely even see straight , much less pay attention to her . " - James , 22 WORK IT TO THE MAX Help him ride out the carnal roller coaster . If you sense your guys moinentain is lagging , wliip out some dirty talk .

The longer you keep him in ibis holding pattern , the more pleasurable the explosion will be for him-and the more likely you are to get yours . Stage 4 CLIMAX TIME HIS BRAIN : " In those moments just prior to ejaculation , your man 's brain basically shuts down , " says Kerner . " He 's compk'tely overcome by the physical sensations . " And afterward , lie feels a huge relief . " The sexual chemical prolactin is released into his system after climax to relieve his body from the rigors of ejaculation and to take his mind off sex , " explains Kerner . So il you 're dating one of those guys who immediately wants to jump out of bed and , say , wash the car-now you know why . Of course , most men crash alter sex .

AS ONE GUY PUTS IT : " Ejaculation creates this unbelievable sensation of something rushing from your body-you can actually feel liquid channeling down through your pipes . The best sex feels like mild electric shocks that begin at my groin then course through my body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his orgasm . You can do that by pulling your guy deep inside you as he ejaculates to create an intense , powerfully connected sensation . " Stimulating him throughout the orgasm is important , " explains Kerner . But immediately following climax , blood rushes away from your man 's penis , leaving him unable to endure anything more than feather-light strokes .
