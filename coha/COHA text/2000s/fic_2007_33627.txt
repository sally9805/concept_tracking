Chapter One The London residence of Mr. and Mrs. Maximus Dunroy October 1 , 1807 Francesca Dunroy waited for Lord Penthorpe , the most disreputable rake in London , in the darkness of the terrace outside her father 's library , the only relatively private place in a house bursting with guests , laughter , and music . She 'd sent him a note , imploring His Lordship to meet her . He was late . He was making her cool her heels , knowing , as she did , that with one word he could ruin her . For the hundredth time she wondered why she had been foolish enough to trust him , and knew the answeri&gt;because her father would never have approved of him . Her life until now had been very sheltered . She 'd truly been unprepared for the onslaught of feelings Penthorpe 's secret , dashing , whirlwind courtship had inspired . He was the very opposite of the prosaic young men who wanted her hand for no other reason than her inheritance . He made her feel beautiful . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in love with him . His attentions had been a ray of shining hope in a world too long confused and saddened by her mother Grace 's long sickness and eventual death . Caring for her mother , honoring her , had delayed Francesca 's presentation to society . At four and twenty , an age whenmost unmarried women are ready for the shelf , she 'd found herself being presented with girls some five years younger than she . Francesca had felt awkward and alone . The marriage mart was a competitive experience . The other girls , no matter what their age , had not liked the competition of an heiress . Of course , her father had made it easy for them to shut her out . Max Dunroy was considered personally unacceptable among the hostesses of the ton . Grace had been one of their most respected and admired members . They had been scandalized that Max had n't waited even a month to marry Regina , who was a year younger than Francesca . To demonstrate their displeasure , those powerful hostesses , led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regina , who so dearly wanted to be one of their number . This ostracism also included Francesca . Was it any wonder then that she had fallen into Penthorpe 's trap ? After all , he knew how to charm a woman . He spoke to her as if she had the freedom and intelligence to make her own choices . It was heady stuff . And so , when he 'd suggested she visit his private apartments where they could speak freely and without prying ears and eyes , Francesca had recklessly agreed . Two days ago , thinking herself safe because it was the middle of the afternoon , she had disguised herself in boy 's clothes and , with the help of her maid and a footman , snuck out of her house without alarm . She 'd anticipated a lark , an adventure . Instead she 'd met disaster . Penthorpe had not wanted some innocent meeting . He 'd wanted to elope , a step she had n't been ready to take . Perhaps she would have run away with him if he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year or two . He had n't been willing to delay two seconds . He 'd wanted her fortune . And when she 'd refused to leave with him , he 'd attempted rape to force her . Only her quick wits and a well-aimed kick had protected her virtue . (
