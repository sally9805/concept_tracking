When buying a digital camera , many people focus on just one factor : megapixels , the more the better . But that 's not the whole story . Lens quality , image-processing capability and even the size of the pixels can all have a greater effect on how your pictures turn out . " The number of megapixels , " says Bob Sobol , an image scientist at Hewlett-Packard , " is relatively unimportant . " <P> What the quantity of megapixels ( each one equals a million pixels ) does determine is how big you should make your prints . For most consumers , a bottom-of-the-line , 2-megapixel model is just fine for producing great 4-in. by 6-in. prints . Opt for 3 to 4 megapixels if you want to print 8-by-10s . You need the newer 5-or 8-megapixel models only if you want to create poster-size prints or plan to crop and zoom in your pictures on your computer screen before you print them . <P> If you were to crack open your digital camera , one thing you would find is the image sensor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with millions of pixels tightly packed together . When struck by light , each pixel generates an electric current that is converted into the digital data that make up your picture . But not all pixels are created equal , and some cameras use larger ones than others . For example , the pixels on the HP Photosmart R707 measure just 2.8 microns wide , whereas those on the Nikon D70 are 7.8 microns wide . ( A micron is tiny  --  1/24,500 of an inch . ) The advantage of a larger pixel is that it is able to pick up more information about the image it is sensing . <P> Another factor affecting quality is the brains of your camera . A digital camera needs to have enough processing power to transform those raw data into a focused and to pull in enough light to get a good exposure . " If you have a bad lens , the number of megapixels does n't mean anything , " says Atsushi Tashiro , a product-development manager for Fujifilm . <P> How do you find the camera that 's right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sites like
