<p> Moving day for NCAA <p> Location , location , location . The thing that drives the real estate industry now takes precedence in the early stages of the NCAA women 's tournament . <p> Last season , when the predetermined sites format debuted , only two of the 16 hosts did n't make the 64-team NCAA field . Ten advanced to the Sweet 16 . <p> It 's possible that half of this year 's host schools may not be involved when the NCAA comes to their campuses . The NCAA rotated all but one of the sites , moving away from such dominant home floors as Tennessee , UConn , Texas Tech , Penn State , Georgia , Purdue and Louisiana Tech . <p> Among those teams likely to be at home and among the top 16 seeds this time around are Texas , LSU , Duke and Minnesota . In addition , Virginia Tech and Notre Dame also will get to play in environments that are inhospitable to visitors . Tennessee should feel at home in Chattanooga , as will UConn in Bridgeport , Conn. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site is up for grabs , a situation that could lend itself to the kind of parity in March that has marked most of the season thus far . The NCAA committee is going to have some interesting decisions to make in assembling a strong bracket while boosting attendance and interest . <p> Perhaps the most intriguing situation is at The Pit in Albuquerque , the only repeat host , where hot-drawing New Mexico , never a national powerhouse , broke through to the Sweet 16 . The Lobos ( 13-7 ) are n't as good this year , sporting an RPI of 107 . If they get on a roll between now and March , it might be hard to leave them out . <p> Florida State 's chances of playing at the Tallahassee-Leon County Civic Center are diminished by a 12-11 record , 5-7 in the ACC . Unless the Seminoles get going , it might make sense to move the hated Florida Gators or Georgia there , possibly as a top 16 seed , for some relatively local flavor . <p> Arizona State is in the same boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sun Devils have a good RPI of 22 and a recent victory over Stanford . Ohio State ( 14-8 , 6-1 Big Ten ) helped its chances of showing up for its subregional with a 75-57 victory over Minnesota on Thursday . Montana and Chattanooga need to win their conference tournaments in the Big Sky and Southern , respectively . UC-Santa Barbara also is on the edge with a 16-5 record and an RPI of 59 . Iowa State looks out of the running to play host in Ames ; it 's 10-11 , 3-7 in the Big 12 . <p> Everything changes next year , when the NCAA uses eight subregional sites for the women 's tournament , as it currently does for the men . <p> GO WITH THE ( SW ) MO <p> There is basketball life in the Ozarks after Jackie Stiles . Three years after the NCAA 's career points champion became America 's jump-shooting sweetheart while taking Southwest Missouri State to an improbable appearance in the Final Four , the Lady Bears are back in the national headlines . Before they were upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops in Division I in winning percentage , and had won 18 consecutive games . <p> There are some Georgia ties  --  coach Katie Abrahamson  --  Henderson played at Georgia and Iowa in the late 1980s , and former UGA assistant Terri Flournoy is on the staff . <p> The only loss for the Lady Bears this season came in the Virgin Islands in November , when they fell 78-71 in the Paradise Jam tournament to Georgia Tech . That was back when the Yellow Jackets looked as if they might be a team worthy of a repeat NCAA trip . Now that victory looks like little more than a consolation . <p> THE PAC(IFIST) 10 <p> When the standard-bearer of a conference short on quality hits the skids , chalking that up to parity is more than a stretch . Pac-10 coaches are understandably defensive about how their league seems to get little respect year after year . But Stanford 's recent slide is another indicator that the conference will continue to get a bad rap . The Cardinal lost at Arizona and Arizona State last weekend . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of whom look to be good bets to join Stanford in the NCAAs . <p> But that 's about it from the Pac-10 , which suffered the indignity of placing only two teams , Stanford and Arizona State , in the NCAA field in 2001-02 . By the way , Arizona and Arizona State took it on the chin Thursday , to USC and UCLA , respectively , which are both pining to get in NCAA contention . Two teams seems about right again this year . <p> WORTH NOTING <p> Maryland 's overhaul was considered a long-term project when coach Brenda Frese arrived from Minnesota before last season . <p> Long an ACC and national powerhouse under Chris Weller , the Terrapins faded badly in the 1990s , reaching the NCAA tournament just twice since 1997 . <p> On Thursday , Maryland notched its 15th victory of the year and moved to 7-5 in the ACC , third behind Duke and North Carolina . Maryland visits Georgia Tech today with a chance to equal its best victory total in five years and take another step toward sealing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarray below them , the Terps are looking good for March . <p> " Never in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen so soon , " Frese said . " They 've played with a lot of pride . " <p> Freshman guards Kalika France and Shay Doron have been major reasons for the resurgence , as is juco forward Delvona Oliver . <p> * Pack storms back : After a school-worst 0-6 start in the ACC , N.C. State is giving itself a chance to end two years without NCAA play . The Wolfpack trounced slumping Clemson 76-55 on Thursday to move to 14-11 , 6-6 in the ACC . <p> The remainder of the regular season wo n't be easy , however , as the ' Pack plays three equally desperate teams  --  Virginia , Florida State and Georgia Tech  --  as well as juggernaut Duke . <p> SEC <p> If not now , when ? <p> When will Tennessee lose again in the SEC ? <p> This was supposed to be the year for others in the league to catch the Lady Volunteers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Cham- ique Holdsclaw , Tamika Catchings and Kara Lawson have in recent years . Then point guard Loree Moore went out for the season with a knee injury in late January . <p> The Vols held on to defeat Georgia 70-67 Thursday despite committing 28 turnovers and looking very beatable . But Tennessee ( 20-2 , 9-0 ) now has won 29 consecutive regular-season games in the SEC and 14 on the road . The Vols passed perhaps its toughest test in Athens . A seventh consec- utive SEC regular-season crown ( including a share with Georgia in 2000 ) is close at hand . <p> With coach Pat Summitt signing what is being hailed in some corners as the best women 's incoming class of all time for next season , what has been the nation 's strongest conference may continue to be a one-team show . <p> * No. 700 , in absentia : The nasty viral infection and bout with bronchitis that has ailed LSU coach Sue Gunter kept her sidelined Thursday when the Tigers earned her career victory No. 700 , 92-65 over Arkansas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summitt and Texas coach Jody Conradt , but she has missed eight games due to her illness . No. 16 LSU ( 19-4 , 7-2 ) , which plays at Florida today looking to hold on to second place in the SEC , is 7-1 with associate head coach Pokey Chatman at the helm. 291 : Associated Press national polls released between Dec. 27 , 1987 , when Texas was last ranked No. 1 , and last week , when Texas returned to the top spot 11 : Seasons since somebody other than Tennessee or Georgia won the SEC regular season championship .
