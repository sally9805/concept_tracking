Depression is  --  well , yes  --  a depressing topic . It costs the nation gazillions annually in medical bills and in man-hours lost to , and we 're speaking literally here , downtime . <P> Yet there is this paradox about it : it 's one of our most reliable sources of laughter , the subject of , just last year , some of our most interesting and weirdly entertaining movies . Punch-Drunk Love , Adaptation and About Schmidt are all bleak comedies about emotionally stunned or stunted people trying , in their herky-jerky ways , to avoid a completely comatose condition . <P> To their number we must now add American Splendor , which is technically a biopic about a guy named Harvey Pekar . Who , you ask , is Harvey Pekar ? And why should he rate a biopic when I do n't ? ( That second question qualifies you as a perfect audience for this movie . ) But as written and directed by the wife-husband team of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini , the film is concerned mainly with the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , until his retirement in 2001 , a file clerk in a Veterans Affairs hospital , a housekeeping-challenged resident of the grimmer reaches of Cleveland , Ohio , and a man whose soon-to-be wife threw up immediately upon making out with him for the first time . <P> Pekar , who occasionally appears as himself in the film but is mostly played ( brilliantly ) as a sort of hand-cranked motormouth by Paul Giamatti , is a guy who hears America squawking and whining and choking on its own bile . Befriended by such comics artists as R. Crumb , Pekar starts turning out stories for them to illustrate . These anticomics , from which American Splendor gets its title , together with some appearances on Late Night with David Letterman , grant him underground fame but never enough money to quit his day job . <P> Which is a good thing . You stop shopping for your own groceries , and you lose touch with your material  --  and perhaps your misery , which for Pekar includes a bout of stomach cancer . Although for Harvey , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of sympathy , spaciness and bitchiness by Hope Davis , to keep him in touch with his inner querulousness . <P> Berman and Pulcini have devised a perky-quirky style to tell Pekar 's story , blending documentary material , comic panels and some editing tricks to create a kind of bipolar movie , not exactly haha funny but true to life  --  at least , to life on that unlevel playing field where Pekar ( and millions like him ) does his level best to keep going .  --  By Richard Schickel
