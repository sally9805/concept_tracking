The Sims family of Cleveland Heights , Ohio , includes ( top , r . ) Khalida , 15 ; ( top , 1. ) her older sister , Kimili , 21 , a senior at Bowling Green State University ; ( bottom , 1 . ) Rufus Sims , an attorney ; and his wife Yvonne , a high school guidance counselor . They have worked around their demanding schedules to stay involved with their daughters . // YVONNE Sims of Cleveland Heights , Ohio , who has spent over two decades as a teacher and guidance counselor , has helped many students-including her former fifthgrade pupil , actress Halle Berry  --  go on to lead successful lives . She 's also witnessed the twists and turns of the teenage experience . The lessons of those experiences came in handy when it was time for Sims ' older daughter , Kimili , to move into the teenage years . " I pride myself in the relationship I have with my daughters , " Sims says . " For as much as I 've invested in the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure I invested as much with my own children . Being there for them , doing things with them , listening to them , spending quality time with them , all of the things I would see , from an educator 's perspective , lacking in the students I had to deal with . I wanted to make sure my children were n't on the minus side . " As expected , Yvonne Sims and her husband , Rufus Sims , an attorney , had their share of ups and downs , and probably lost a hair or two . But they were successful in leading Kimili into her adult life . Kimili , 21 , is now a senior at Bowling Green State University . The Sims family will use the same recipe of a cupful of love , a spoonful of discipline and a dash of space to steer their younger child , 15-year-old Khalida , down the same path . And there 's one more ingredient that is sure to put the teenager over the top-parental participation . Photograph A fun-loving family , the Sims share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager 's development , experts say . // Staying involved , experts say , is crucial for parents to form a healthy relationship with teenagers and provide a bridge to a successful adulthood . Studies are proving that parents-not peers-are the No. 1 source of strength and direction for teenagers . " Parents , do n't underestimate how important you are to your child , " says Dr. Jerome Taylor , a psychologist and executive director of the Center for Family Excellence , based in Pittsburgh . " So often we picture adolescence as being independent of parents . But parents , do n't be fooled . We have to be convinced that material blessings are not the most essential blessings they need to make it through adolescence . They need the engaging acceptance and warmth of parents . " Just ask Kimili , who credits her parents ' support during her teenage years for her success today . " They definitely have determined my success , and seeing how hard my parents work lets me know that 's what I am supposed to be doing , " says Kimili , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're like my light in the darkness . " Despite the obvious incentives of active involvement with teens , some parents , unfortunately , still do n't get it . One of the biggest obstacles parents face in being involved is their attitude , Taylor says . Often , Black professional parents supply their families a plush house and school system in the suburbs , then find themselves puzzled when the teen lacks motivation . Security alone wo n't do ; parents still have to take the initiative and be active participants in their children 's lives . " The first part of it is acknowledgement that they must be involved . It 's not always there , " Taylor explains . " Sometimes , parents feel that if they can provide the material possessions that they never had , then that will be sufficient to see their child through the turmoil . But parents have to equip themselves with the disposition to get involved . " Yvonne and Rufus Sims " activities with their children revolve around Glenville New Life Community Church on Cleveland 's East Side , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth groups and pitch in by driving to activities whenever they can , among other things . The Sims family diligently tries to remain a part of one another 's lives in spite of the demanding schedules that both working parents have to endure . Even if the family simply watches TV together or Khalida , the younger daughter , pampers her hardworking father by oiling his scalp and giving him a back massage , they make every minute count . " We 're really a laid-back family , " Yvonne Sims says . " We view TV together and we act silly together . A majority of the time , we do n't need a lot of company . We can act a fool by ourselves ! The girls get a kick out of watching their dad and me hand dance , and then they 'll try . On the other hand , we try to keep up line-dancing with them . " Photograph Mother and daughter check lessons on the computer . Yvonne Sims says she goes out of her way to make sure her children do n't fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but quality time should also be serious time . Use your moments with teenagers to set the ground rules of what to do and what not to do , Taylor says . " Teenagers need firmness in discipline , " Taylor adds . " Parents need to think about not only what they require , but also why they require it . Because they face greater temptations , by not providing reasons , we make them vulnerable to those temptations by simply asserting rules without providing some kind of explanation for those rules . " The same advice can be applied when teaching values to teens . Rufus Sims was at odds with Kimili , his older daughter , over one boyfriend , and it caused a stir in the family . " Rufus got a little verbal on the young man about how he carried himself , especially with work , " Yvonne Sims says . " He said , You 've got to be working , in school or doing something if you want to spend time in this house . You have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have that . " Rufus Sims held his ground , and soon after , Kimili says she discovered that her father was right : The boyfriend would not be a good fit . The episode displayed not only the power of a parent 's guidance , but the trust a parent must have that the teen will make the right choices at the right time . " You 're not going to watch them every minute , " Rufus Sims says . " Give them a good , solid Christian base , and then let them fly . Let them go . They 'll fall and make mistakes , but they 'll be fine . We all did it . " Yvonne and Rufus Sims have been a little more lenient with Khalida than with Kimili . For example , Kimili could n't receive phone calls from the opposite sex until she was 16 . Yet Khalida is allowed to receive calls from boys at age 14 because , her parents say , she 's " more sophisticated " than Kimili was at that age . Even so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Khalida says she 's still wary of wrong impressions guys may get if she lets her guard down . " My parents always told me how to carry myself as a young lady , " Khalida says . " People are always looking at you no matter where you are , and you just have to carry yourself in an appropriate way because you are representing your family and everything that is a part of you . " Teenagers and parents are n't always on the same page when it comes to future plans . College has always been in the girls ' plans , Yvonne Sims says , and her daughters agree . Kimili 's major is education , a decision that sits well with her parents . Meanwhile , Khalida wants to major in theater , and her parents have expressed their displeasure . They are concerned that Khalida wo n't have a solid financial future by taking that route . Be careful on this one , Taylor advises . If parents try too hard to implement their plan for success , nobody wins as the struggle becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut them some slack , " Taylor says . " I 'm not encouraging parents to cover up their feelings , but do n't get into the child 's way . The child needs to know your feelings . Maybe , at some point , the child will come to the same conclusion . Maybe , at some point , the child says I have to do it , because it feels right to me . And the parents have to back off and respect that . " To the " relief of Yvonne and Rufus Sims , Khalida is now leaning toward a career as an interior designer . Even Khalida knows her parents are simply doing what they 've always done : Looking out for her best interests and preparing her for a successful post-teenage life . " The quality of warmth and love for their child has to be very overtly expressed , " Taylor says . " There 's a lot that our adolescents face . They need some assurance they are loved and accepted , that life is worthwhile . Parents provide that ground . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
