Most of the chairs at the Prime Minister 's table are empty now , and the long cloth is littered with the remains of a large early-evening repast : half-eaten bowls of lamb and okra , traces of hummus , a dented mound of rice . As he stirs three small , white tablets of artificial sweetener into a tear-shaped glass of tea , Ibrahim al-Jaafari describes the scolding he gave the Minister of the Interior that morning . A U.S. raid the day before had found evidence that Iraqi police were torturing detainees at a secret prison in Baghdad . Soon after he was told about it , al-Jaafari announced he was launching a full investigation . But even he has no illusions about how much control he actually has over his Cabinet . He did n't really make the appointments , he notes . Instead , the political parties " divided the government in shares , " like warlords divvying up fiefdoms . " When the Prime Minister is responsible for forming the ministries , " he told TIME wistfully , revealing the weakness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . " He was n't really referring to himself in the third person . He is unlikely to be the Prime Minister for much longer . <P> Al-Jaafari has been Prime Minister for just about eight months , and a new government is expected to be elected on Dec. 15 . But his experience is both a harbinger of and a template for the travails of Iraq , as well as a once and future job description for how to deal with fractiousness and tumult . The elections are unlikely to provide any party with a governing majority , forcing contending groups to compromise once more and produce the kind of jigsaw Cabinet that has proved not to work so far . The new Prime Minister is likely to discover that he must act as al-Jaafari has : as a mediator and patchwork maker . Some analysts , attempting political clairvoyance , have said that the lack of a strong leader may then tempt one faction or another to stage a coup d ' tat . <P> What is certain is that the next head of government will inherit rampant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly insurgencies ( on Friday and Saturday alone , five suicide bombings killed more than 120 people ) , an Iraqi army riddled with factional militiamen and a police force suspected of conniving in sectarian violence . A case in point is last week 's discovery by U.S. forces of 173 prisoners at an Interior Ministry bunker . The majority of them were believed to be Sunni and several reportedly showed signs of torture or starvation . It has only increased the public perception that the Interior Ministry , which runs the police , is under the sway of a powerful Shi'ite faction . The head of the Interior Ministry is Bayan Jabr , a man reportedly with ties to the pro-Iranian Badr Corps , the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq . Although al-Jaafari berated him after the discovery was made public , Jabr was apportioned his ministry by political agreement , and al-Jaafari , who is also Shi'ite but of another party , can do nothing to get rid of him . Jabr has denied allegations that militiamen have been using the Iraqi police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear on the name of God , " Abu Rasul al-Shebani , spokesman for the Badr Corps , told TIME , " nobody in the Badr Corps is in the Ministry of the Interior .
