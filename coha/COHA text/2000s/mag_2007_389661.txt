GIVE A LITTLE , GET A LOT BY TOM CHIARELLA There is only one trick to getting more . It is the easiest piece of advice in this entire magazine . It is so blazingly simple that I am going to take an extra sentence or two before I say what it is , only because it wo n't seem like much of a payoff if I do n't . To get a little more , you have to give more . This does not mean tipping or glad-handing . It does not mean bribery . It does n't really involve money at all . If it were that easy , they 'd just put a price list on faster service , window views , comps , long pours on the bourbon . You 'd pay a little more for a little more , and we 'd all go crazy with the folded-up bills . It 's really more about you . You have to commodify your attention and energy and recognize that value . And then you give it to the people who least expect it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front desk . Look them up and down ; read them . Then pause and make them see you . Your desires do not have to be at cross purposes with their capabilities . Announce what you want and show what you will give . I hate the word giving . It has the connotative texture of pabulum . But in this , there is no substitute . You have to be willing to offer more of yourself to the human process . You have to ask questions , give compliments , treat the world of people who work for you , and with you , with some modicum of honor ( which is far more than the foot traffic of the everyday allows ) . You have to see the person and open yourself to the possibility of being seen . There is no price tag . Show them you appreciate that . And when you stand up straight , announce what you want , and show what you are willing to give  --  a little of your time , a measure of your good humor , a moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clarity as power . That 's when the giving becomes the getting . Was n't that what you were after ? The Rules : Influence Rule No. 176 : A decent bottle of wine is a fine gift for the host . A nice bottle of port is even better . Rule No. 202 : Tipping the bartender unusually well on the first round may get you a faster pour or a free round , but it wo n't make you George Clooney . Rule No. 255 : When calling to make a reservation , start by announcing your name , first and last . For some reason , this makes the person on the other end think he should know who you are . Rule No. 333 : If you have a dollar , give it to the men's-room attendant . If you do n't , do n't sweat it . You did n't ask him to be in there .

If one is available , we 'll give it to you . But things like in-room Internet , room service , and premium cable  --  those are pretty much nonnegotiable things that the clerk ca n't control the pricing of or wipe off a bill . They 're monitored electronically . So do n't bother . CASINO DEALER H. Lee Barnes , former casino dealer , author of Dummy Up and Deal One of the best things you can do when you sit down and win a couple of hands , when you put a tip out , actually talk to the dealer like he 's a human being instead of in the third person . That breaks down barriers . It 's not just being polite ; it 's actually engaging . The worst thing you can do is walk up to a dealer and say , " Are you lucky today ? " I 'm lucky every day because Pascal 's probabilities of chance are on my side .

Dark chocolate goes a long way . REALTOR Colleen Pearsall , owner , 4% Properties , Fort Myers , Florida , author of Confessions of a Realtor If you 're buying : Make sure the listings you 're shown are not only from the company whose office you 're sitting in . In some offices , there 's a mandate to sell in-house listings before other properties . Insist that your broker show you everything that 's out there and you 'll see listings from thousands of agents . If you 're selling : Tell your broker you 're not interested in an open house . Open houses do n't work . They benefit the agent , not the seller . Less than 1 percent of the homes sell at an open house , but it gets buyers for me . When people come to an open house , they 're walking in blind . What 's the chance it will fit their parameters ? Slim . But I can capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City There are n't any magic words to say to Ticketmaster . Getting good seats at a big Broadway show without paying $800 usually comes down to meeting a cast or crew member , producer , or theater owner . Do your homework and find out who they are by picking up a Playbill . The week of your visit , frequent the old Broadway haunts around five o'clock . Try Angus McIndoe 's , at 258 West 44th Street ( 1 ) ; Sardi 's , at 234 West 44th ( 2 ) ; and Joe Allen 's , at 326 West 46th ( 3 ) . Ingratiate yourself with the patrons and maybe you 'll get lucky .

It depends on the airport , though . Highway Patrolman Dale C. Carson , former cop and FBI special agent , coauthor of Arrest-Proof Yourself Acceptance of responsibility is key . You want to demonstrate to the officer that not only are you not a threat to anybody , but you behave yourself and you 're a good person . It 's very refreshing for an officer to come across somebody who 's not confrontational , who does n't cop an attitude . Just say , " Officer , I really made a mistake and I apologize . I 'll try to do better the next time . " When you say that to the officer , you 've disarmed him .
