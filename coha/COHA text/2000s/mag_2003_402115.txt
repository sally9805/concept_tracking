// The notion of stagecraft , or theatricality , in relation to glass art nestled at the heart of the exhibition " Fire and Form : The Art of Contemporary Glass , " at the Norton Museum of Art , West Palm Beach , Florida , January 25-March 23 . It was one of four organizing concepts that also included nature , abstraction and " flesh and bone , " or figuration . At least one artist , Tom Patti , eschewed the prevailing drama . His modestly scaled , **28;1854;TOOLONG glass sculptures are the antithesis of showmanship . " It 's the drama of fire that attracts most people to glass , but the content and the ideas are what draw me to it , " he said in conversation at the exhibition opening . His geometric abstractions , such as Red Lumina Echo , 1991 , and Ascending Red , 1990 , reveal themselves only slowly to the patient eye . Compact and enigmatic , these sculptures exhibit a dense stratigraphy of fused layers of glass , enlivened by interior bubbles alluding to the glassblowing process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadowed by the visual opulence of much other work in the show . The seductive side of glass was well represented by glassblowers like Dante Marioni and Lino Tagliapietra , who can hardly be accused of making ugly things . Tagliapietra 's Samba do Brasil , 2000 , for instance , is a colorful series of sensuously rounded , striated forms , each reaching skyward , gracefully bending their slender necks like dancers or sea creatures . Photograph // " Fire and Form , " consisting of 100 works by 31 American and European artists , was assembled by guest curator William Warmus , a past editor of Glass magazine and a former curator at the Corning Museum of Glass . He selected the work largely from private holdings in south Florida . Warmus came to the project at the urging of Dale and Doug Anderson , longtime glass collectors and supporters of the Norton . He writes eloquently in the catalog about viewing glass sculptures and abstract paintings in the light-struck interiors of Florida homes : " Both types of artwork live for light , and Florida continually bathes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapeutic sun . . . . I became literally immersed in art . I was floating from collection to collection . " No wonder he came to the conclusion , as he stated in the first line of his essay , that " glass is the buoyant medium . " To his credit , Warmus brought together a fairly eclectic body of work , mingling well-known and less familiar names . One of the most alluring pieces in the show , in fact , was the work of a relative newcomer , the Polish emigre Anna Skibska . Her ensemble of glass forms offered a stunning opening act . Called Ten , 2002 , the installation consisted often fused-glass cocoons , most four to five feet high , hung in a darkened antechamber . These crystalline chrysalises , seemingly knit together and draped around a central cavity , would hardly draw a second look if they were woven from fibers . But , composed of hundreds of tiny clear-glass rods painstakingly joined using only tweezers and a small torch , Skibska 's glass skeins appear exquisitely delicate and fragile . Dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leavings of a magical , glass-spinning bug . If elegance is refusal , as the Vogue editor Diana Vreeland famously said , then many of the most elegant objects in the exhibition were to be found gathered under the rubric of abstraction . Laura de Santillana was represented by two handblown , vessel-shaped pieces that deny any claim to functionality , except as symbolic carriers of meaning . Domestic in scale but collapsed in volume , they look as if air had been blown in and then sucked out . Though she is known as a colorist , de Santillana 's C5 ( Lacrime ) , 2001 , made of milky , whitish glass , was the more intriguing work of the two , its imploded form containing ghostly traces of liquid movement reminiscent of clouds or tears . The grouping Warmus dubbed " flesh and bone , " devoted to representations of human and animal figures , was home to extraordinary artistic bio-diversity . Nicolas Africano 's serenely classical sculptures of dreaming women stood not far from Hank Murta Adams 's rough-hewn glass heads . Ginny Ruffner 's warm-hearted lampworked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three dimensions , were located near Bertil Vallien 's icy , cast-glass heads . Particularly apt if heavy-handed metaphors for the hidden depths and surface accretions of human personality , Vallien 's sculptures were mounted like primitive trophies on tall , columnar supports . Similarly , the portion of the exhibition devoted to " stagecraft " encompassed everything from Judith Schaechter 's narrative stained-glass windows , which have grown less overtly sensationalistic but no less technically complex over time , to Dale Chihuly 's Macchia Forest , a ravishing ensemble of flowerlike blooms of glass mounted in a central location . Clearly enough , William Warmus 's point is well taken . Glass artists have chosen to work in a spectacular medium . Many of them do not hesitate to embrace its potential for visual drama . Let 's hope , however , that the ample surface charms of this formable , transparent medium continue to be counterbalanced by artists ' quests for deeper meaning .
