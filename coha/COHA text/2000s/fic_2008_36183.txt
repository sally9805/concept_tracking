December 22 , 1896 <p> Lizzie McKettrick leaned slightly forward in her seat , as if to do so would make the train go faster . Home . She was going home , at long last , to the Triple M Ranch , to her large , rowdy family . After more than two years away , first attending Miss Ridgely 's Institute of Deportment and Refinement for Young Women , then normal school , Lizzie was returning to the place and the people she loved  --  for good . She would arrive a day before she was expected , too , and surprise them all  --  her papa , her stepmother , Lorelei , her little brothers , John Henry , Gabriel , and Doss . She had presents for everyone , most sent ahead from San Francisco weeks ago , but a few especially precious ones secreted away in one of her three huge travel trunks . <p> Only her grandfather , Angus McKettrick , the patriarch of the sprawling clan , knew she 'd be there that very evening . He 'd be waiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Rock , probably at the reins of one of the big flat-bed sleighs used to carry feed to snowbound cattle on the range . She 'd warned him , in her most recent letter , that she 'd be bringing all her belongings with her , for this homecoming was permanent  --  not just a brief visit , like the last couple of Christmases . <p> Lizzie smiled a mischievous little smile . Even Angus , her closest confidant except for her parents , did n't know all the facts . <p> She glanced sideways at Whitley Carson , slumped against the sooty window in the seat next to hers , huddled under a blanket , sound asleep . His breath fogged the glass , and every so often , he stirred fitfully , grumbled something . <p> Alas , for all his sundry charms , Whitley was not an enthusiastic traveler . His complaints , over the three days since they 'd boarded the first train in San Francisco , had been numerous . <p> The train was filthy . <p> There was no dining car . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never going to be warm again . <p> And what in God 's green earth had possessed the woman three rows behind them to undertake a journey of any significant distance with two rascally children and a fussy infant in tow ? <p> Now the baby let out a pitiable squall . <p> Lizzie , used to babies because there were so many on the Triple M , was unruffled . Whitley 's obvious annoyance troubled her . Although she planned to teach , married or not , she hoped for a houseful of children of her own someday  --  healthy , noisy , rambunctious ones , raised to be confident adults and freethinkers . <p> It was hard , in the moment , to square the Whitley she was seeing now with the kind of father she had hoped he would be . <p> The man across the aisle from her laid down his newspaper , stood and stretched . He 'd boarded the train several hours earlier , in Phoenix , carrying what looked like a doctor 's bag , its leather sides cracked and scratched . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hat nor a sidearm  --  the absence of both unusual in the still-wild Arizona Territory . <p> Although Lizzie expected Whitley to propose marriage once they were home with her family , she 'd been stealing glances at the stranger ever since he entered the railroad car . There was something about him , beyond his patrician good looks , that constantly drew her attention . <p> His hair was dark , and rather too long , his eyes brown and intense , bespeaking formidable intelligence . Although he probably was n't a great deal older than Lizzie , who would turn twenty on her next birthday , there was a maturity in his manner and countenance that intrigued her . It was as though he 'd lived many other lives , in other times and places , and extracted wisdom from them all . <p> She heard him speak quietly to the harried mother , turned and felt a peculiar little clench in the secret regions of her heart when she saw him holding the child , bundled in a shabby patchwork quilt coming apart at the seams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few other passengers in the car . A wan and painfully thin soldier in a blue army uniform , recuperating from some dire illness or injury , by the looks of him . A portly salesman who held what must have been his sample case on his lap , one hand clasping the handle , the other a smoldering cigar . He seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of the things , and he 'd been puffing on them right along . An older couple , gray-haired and companionable , though they seldom spoke , accompanied by an exotic white bird in a splendid brass cage . Glorious blue feathers adorned its head , and when the cage was n't covered in its red velvet drape , the bird chattered . <p> All of them , except for Whitley , of course , were strangers . And seeing Whitley in this new and disconcerting light made him seem like a stranger , too . <p> A fresh wave of homesickness washed over Lizzie . She longed to be among people she knew . Lorelei , her stepmother , would be baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her father , Holt , would be locked away in his wood shop between ranch chores , building sleds and toy buckboards and doll-houses , some of which would be gifts to Lizzie 's brothers and various cousins , though the majority were sure to find their way onto some of the poorer homesteads surrounding the Triple M. <p> There were always a lot of presents tucked into the branches of the family 's tree and piled beneath it , and an abundance of savory food , too , but a McKettrick Christmas centered on giving to folks who did n't have so much . Lorelei , Lizzie herself , and all the aunts made rag dolls and cloth animals with stuffing inside , to be distributed at the community celebration at the church on Christmas Eve . <p> The stranger walked the aisle with the baby , bringing Lizzie 's mind back to the here and now . He glanced down into her upturned face as he passed . He did n't actually smile  --  as little as she knew about him , she had figured out that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes . <p> Lizzie felt a flash of shame . She should have offered to spell the anxious mother three rows back . Already the child was settling down a little , cooing and drooling on the man 's once-white shirt . If he minded that , he gave no indication of it . <p> Beyond the train windows , heavy flakes of snow swirled in the gathering twilight , and while Lizzie willed the train to pick up speed , it seemed to be slowing down instead . <p> She was just about to speak to the man , reach out for the baby , when a horrific roar , like a thousand separate thunderheads suddenly clashing together , erupted from every direction and from no direction at all . The car jerked violently , stopped with a shudder fit to fling the entire train off the tracks , tilted wildly to one side , then came right again with a sickening jolt . <p> The bird squawked in terror , wings making a frantic slapping sound . <p> Lizzie , nearly thrown from her seat , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up to see the stranger , still upright , the baby safe in the curve of his right arm . He 'd managed somehow to stay on his feet , retain his hold on the child and keep Lizzie from slamming into the seat in front of her . <p> " Wh-what ? " she murmured , bewildered by shock . <p> " An avalanche , probably , " the man replied calmly , as though a massive snowslide was no more than he would have expected of a train ride through the rugged high country of the northern Arizona Territory . <p> Whitley , shaken awake , was as frightened as the bird . " Are we derailed ? " he demanded . <p> The stranger ignored him . " Is anyone hurt ? " he asked , of the company in general , patting the baby 's back and bouncing it a little against his shoulder . <p> " My arm , " the woman in back whimpered . " My arm  --  " <p> " Nobody panic , " the man in the aisle said , shoving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical kit from the rack above his seat . He spoke quietly to the elderly couple ; Lizzie saw them nod their heads . They were all right , then . <p> " Nobody panic ! " the bird cawed . " Nobody panic ! " <p> Despite the gravity of the situation , Lizzie had to smile at that . <p> Whitley rubbed his neck , eyeing the medical bag , after tossing a brief , disgruntled glare at the bird . " I think I 'm hurt , " he said . " You 're a doctor , are n't you ? I need laudanum . " <p> " Laudanum ! " the bird demanded . <p> " Hush , Woodrow , " the old lady said . Her husband put the velvet drapery in place , covering the cage , and Woodrow quieted instantly . <p> The doctor 's answer to Whitley was a clipped nod and , " Yes , I 'm a physician . My name is Morgan Shane . I 'll look you over once I 've seen to Mrs. Halifax 's arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace , straining for its mother . <p> " Make him shut up , " Whitley said . " I 'm in pain . " <p> " Shut up ! " Woodrow mimicked , his call muted by the drapery . " I 'm in pain ! " <p> Lizzie paid Whitley no mind , got to her feet . " Dr. Shane ? " <p> He was crouched in the aisle now , next to the baby 's mother , gently examining her right arm . " Yes ? " he said , a little snappishly , not looking away from what he was doing . The older children , a boy and a girl , huddled together in the inside seat , clinging to each other . <p> " The baby  --  the way he 's crying  --  do you think he could be injured ? " <p> " My baby is a girl , " the woman said , between groans . <p> " She 's just had a bad scare , " Dr. Shane told Lizzie , speaking more charitably this time . " Like the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried , " the soldier exclaimed . <p> " Buried ! " Woodrow agreed , with a rustle of feathers . <p> Sure enough , solid snow , laced with tree branches , dislodged stones and other debris , pressed against all the windows on one side of the car . On the other , Lizzie knew from previous journeys aboard the same train , a steep grade plummeted deep into the red rocks of the valley below . <br> Continues ...
