Abrasive and camera hungry , new Jersey 's ROBERT TORRICELLI has infuriated fellow Democratic Senators with his public breaks from party positions . He was one of the first Democrats to suggest that AL GORE throw in the towel during the Florida electoral dispute . So last week , as Torricelli denied charges that he received tens of thousands of dollars in cash and gifts from a political supporter seeking his help in an international business dispute , his Democratic colleagues were n't rushing to defend him in the federal investigation . The probe of Torricelli 's 1996 campaign rests heavily on testimony from DAVID CHANG , a New Jersey businessman who has pleaded guilty in the case . Chang told investigators he lavished suits tailored in Italy , envelopes of cash , earrings for a girlfriend and a used Rolex watch on Torricelli , according to the New York Times . Still , his colleagues are not yet ready for " the Torch " to be extinguished . They have struggled to keep him as part of their united front against Bush 's legislative agenda . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a maverick . <P>  --  By Karen Tumulty and Douglas Waller/Washington
