More Thank Twenty Years From Now <p> <p> From the end of the bar , Tom Wilner could look through the cavernous main room and pool hall and still see her dark hair asshe leaned back in her chair . The boyfriend , Tiget Nadovich , sat next to her , wearing that dark jacket over his black shirtand black pants that Wilner had seen him in twenty times before . <p> <p> It bothered Wilner that all the databases listed him as a citizen of the United States for the last eleven years . That meant he got it just before the ban on immigration . It also meant he got it just for being in the United States when the amnesty bill passed and everyone inside the borders of the country was awarded citizenship . The Congress limited it to the first forty- nine states because they saw the writing on the wall about Hawaii . Once the independence movement started rolling , no one wanted to stand up and say that the native people of Hawaii did n't deserve their own country . Plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time did n't help their position . <p> <p> That 's why the United States took in another twenty- seven million citizens in one day , and then conscripted most of them into the military . Somehow this creep had avoided ser vice , but he was legal and that did n't make Wilner happy . <p> <p> Wilner motioned for the bartender to bring him another Jax beer . Since the government did n't get involved in much regulation of industry there were more products available in more places . Antitrust was a thing of the past . That meant a wider selection of beer and this New Orleans brew was originally deregulated to help raise money for Katrina redevelopment when the government gave up about ten years after the storm . Now everyone drank it . <p> <p> Wilner slowly sipped the beer as his eyes , almost involuntarily , stayed on the woman . Her dazzling smile and her dark eyes conveyed intelligence . <p> <p> " Detective Wilner , " came a voice from behind him , making him jump . <p> <p> Wilner turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> <p> " Hey , Willie , I thought you were busy tonight , or were you just avoiding me ? " <p> <p> " Nothing like that . How 'd you know I was here ? " <p> <p> " Your house keeper . " <p> <p> " When did you talk to her ? " <p> <p> " You are n't answering your V-com . I called the house . " <p> <p> Wilner nodded , looking straight ahead . He 'd turned off his video communicator , which was a misnomer for a device that did much more . <p> <p> " Why 'd you come way out here ? " <p> <p> " Just a nice change . You get a different kind of people wandering through . " <p> <p> " Yeah , folks that do n't want to see the cops . You 're not working on something , are you ? " <p> <p> He shook his head , too embarrassed to admit what he was really doing . He tried to change the subject . " Anything happen on patrol today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stool . " Oh , yeah , riding that bike from the Northern Enclave to the Miami Quarantine Zone is so exciting I never run out of stories . " <p> <p> " What happened ? " <p> <p> " Nothing , you knucklehead . Same as every other day . Just a long ride in soggy weather . " <p> <p> " Lot of area . " <p> <p> Steve mumbled , " Damn Unified Police Force . I remember when each city could field a police department . " <p> <p> " That was a long time ago . No one can afford the taxes now . " <p> <p> They sat in silence until Wilner asked his friend , " Why are n't you reading up on the aliens ? " <p> <p> " Go ahead and make fun . When they finally arrive I 'll be fully informed and know what to do . " Then Steve scanned the room and stopped at the table with the beautiful dark-haired woman . " Oh , I get it . " He looked at Wilner . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " We 're not divorced yet . " <p> <p> " Has she called ? " <p> <p> " No . " <p> <p> " Has she even come by to visit the kids ? " <p> <p> " Once , for Emma 's birthday . " <p> <p> Steve sighed then said , " You 're not armed , are you ? " <p> <p> " Out here , who cares ? More shit goes down between the turnpike and the Everglades than the rest of the state . No one ever investigates . " <p> <p> " But a gun in a bar , even by a cop , would land you ten years on a penal farm . Or worse , ten years back in the military in some godforsaken desert battleground . " <p> <p> Wilner nodded . " You 're right , Steve . And I did leave my pistol in the car . " <p> <p> " You crazy ? In this place ? Shit , I brought in two . " <p> <p> Wilner had to laugh at his smaller friend 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joined Florida 's Unified Police Force about three years after it had been established . <p> <p> Besslia stood up and took hold of Wilner 's arm . " C'm on , buddy , plenty of places for a couple of cops like us to drink . You do n't need to be here . " <p> <p> Wilner jerked his arm free , still staring at his wife at a table of four men . For the first time he noticed that the men all looked similar . All in their thirties , with black hair , high cheekbones and dark eyes . For a moment he wondered if they might not all be brothers , but according to Nadovich 's limited profile he had no living relatives in the United States . <p> <p> The door on that side of the huge bar opened and the rain drifted in . <p> <p> Wilner shivered slightly just thinking about the near endless rain out on the edge of the Everglades . <p> <p> Steve said , " Global warming , my ass . I miss the days when August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about you ? " <p> <p> Wilner settled back onto his stool , glad his friend had known enough to leave him alone about his wife . He said , " I do n't remember mosquitoes . " <p> <p> Now Steve looked across the room . " Those two that just came in could be jihadis if they only had on their headdress . " <p> <p> Wilner nodded . Muslim headwear had been banned in the United States for a dozen years now . Some of the Muslims had left to seek religious freedom elsewhere . He did n't think any of them found it . But Besslia was right  --  with the dark hair and facial features these two did look Middle Eastern . Then , to his surprise , the men walked directly to the table where his wife , Svala , sat with her boyfriend . <p> <p> The table welcomed the Middle Eastern men and then Nadovich leaned to Svala and she stood and slowly tromped toward the bar . <p> <p> Wilner watched her come closer , but she did n't look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddle and then exchange packages . <p> <p> " What 's that look like to you ? " he asked Besslia , who had followed the exchange as well . <p> <p> " Like there are too many of them and it 's none of our business . " <p> <p> Wilner fought the urge to approach his wife . She 'd never notice him all the way in the corner . That was his original intent . Now he faltered . <p> <p> The door on the other side of the room opened again . This time a tall blond man slipped in quickly and settled , unnoticed at a table by the door . <p> <p> Wilner made a quick assessment as the blond man scanned the bar and watched the table with Nadovich . He did n't look that interested in the quiet table 's activities , but something was n't right about him . Wilner had been a cop for six years and he was starting to believe his hunches . Now he had a hunch they were going to see some trouble . <p> <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shorter than the first man , but also blond with light features . This one marched directly across the wide floor toward the table with Nadovich and his friends . <p> <p> Besslia nudged him . " That do n't look good . " <p> <p> " Tell me about it . " <p> <p> " Here , " said Steve , poking him under the bar . <p> <p> " What 's this ? " <p> <p> " My backup . An old Glock .40 caliber conventional handgun . " <p> <p> " You really did have two guns ? " <p> <p> Steve smiled . " Hey , we were n't all combat marines . I brought a knife too . " <p> <p> Wilner accepted the small pistol . " Just in case something goes down , I 'll keep it . " It was light compared to his duty automatic . They were issued conventional firearms , but the rounds were hot , 11 millimeter . Slightly bigger than the .40 , only the military or police were supposed to have the rugged semiautomatic made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and concentrated propellant , his duty weapon carried 28 rounds stacked in a long magazine . <p> <p> The short blond man shouted something in an unknown language as he came to the table and whatever he said got every-one 's attention . Even Svala turned from the bar and looked at the man . He spoke again and then turned and made a spitting sound of disgust . <p> <p> That stirred the table as the two Middle Easterners stood up and backed away , one of them clutching the leather pouch Nadovich had given him . <p> <p> Besslia said , " What 's this ? " <p> <p> Wilner slowly stood , gripping the pistol in his hand under the bar . " Easy , Steve . No harm in just talking shit . Let 's see what happens . " <p> <p> Before he could hear Steve 's reply , gunfire erupted from that side of the room . The pops from the automatic weapon echoing in the tall , wide room like claps of thunder . <p> <p> Wilner instinctively ducked and then moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> The big blond man by the front door leaped and drew a knife as he fell on one of the men from the table . The others had scattered as the second , smaller blond man returned fire with a small machine pistol . <p> <p> Then Wilner saw a flash and heard the crack a split second later . <p> <p> Steve yelled in Wilner 's ear , " Christ , someone has a flasher . I thought only the military had them . " <p> <p> " I guess there are some on the open market . " Then he stood to take another position closer to the action . As he came up from behind the bar another flash of light destroyed a jukebox as it surged past the intended target . An energy weapon , or E-weapon , had been nicknamed a flasher by the Eighty-second Airborne since they first came into use during the third Iraq war . The flash of light beamed through a prism of gases could melt steel , destroy living tissue and cause terror among troops . As the deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of their power . This one was handheld and probably only good for two or three shots . That 's all it usually took . Instantly the jukebox melted and settled into a heap of glass and metal . An old country song skipped on an endless loop of a man singing " Live like you were dying , " over and over . It was still identifiable , but no one would ever hear the jukebox play any other song again . <p> <p> The two blond men , working together , were wading into the group led by Svala 's boyfriend . The taller one used his knife to nearly gut one of the men from the table . The blade cut through his leather jacket and shirt , leaving a vicious gash where blood and internal organs looked ready to spill out onto the bar 's dirty floor . <p> <p> The other man fired his pistol into the center of the group and reached for the satchel sitting on the edge of the round table . <p> <p> Nadovich also grabbed it and the satchel ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had his own pistol and pumped a bullet into the smaller blond man 's chest , sending him back a step . <p> <p> The noise , shouting , smoke and burning jukebox gave a level of confusion that emptied the bar at the edge of the Everglades in moments . Patrons fled out the door nearest Wilner as he and Steve started to advance toward the melee . <p> <p> " Police , do n't move , " shouted Wilner as he ducked , knowing it would draw fire . He was mainly trying to scare the men outside . No one wanted to be caught with unlawful weapons like a flasher . <p> <p> His shout did the trick , as someone threw a chair through a window and men started to flee . <p> <p> Wilner looked to where his wife was standing at the bar . She was rushing to Nadovich 's side and raced out the front door with him . As Wilner stood to follow , another shot came from the fight , but this one was aimed at the two cops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The taller blond man fell to one knee to help his wounded friend . <p> <p> Wilner and Steve advanced , their pistols up and aimed at the remaining conscious men . <p> <p> " Do n't move , do n't move , " he shouted , thinking of his last combat mission in Iran eight years earlier . <p> <p> The big man slowly turned his head . It was the smaller man that surprised them . He had at least two serious bullet wounds yet he stood , turned and dove out the window . <p> <p> Steve muttered , " What the hell were they firing ? Blanks ? " <p> <p> The other man raised his hands . <p> <p> Wilner looked over and saw one of the Middle Eastern men with a gunshot to his face . He was dead . The canvas satchel Nadovich had given him was by his side . The man with the horrendous knife wound lay on the ground , but was still moving . <p> <p> As Wilner heard the sirens in the distance he said , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpse , then looked in the canvas satchel . <p> <p> Steve whistled and held up the bag for Wilner . <p> <p> He stared at what had to be more than a million dollars in standard U.S trade currency that was commonly called " suds . " <p> <p> This whole night was going to raise questions . <p> <p> Excerpted from The Human Disguise by James O ' Neal . Copyright 2009 by James O ' Neal .
