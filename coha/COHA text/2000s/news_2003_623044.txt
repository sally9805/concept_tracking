<p> There 's a sense of pride in this town of 2,025 as Easter Sunday egg hunts , church services and ham dinners draw near . It 's a sign that the hometown hero  --  the glossy white , delicately fragrant lily  --  is gracing millions of homes across America . <p> The coastal region straddling the California-Oregon border , including Smith River , holds the title of Easter Lily Capital of the World . For more than half a century , local growers have supplied most of the potted flowering Easter lilies to the rest of the United States . <p> But this Easter season , there 's a dark side to these magnificent symbols of rebirth . <p> Townspeople are trading stories of newly discovered tainted well water , incidences of sloppy pesticide spraying and a growing concern over the health of California 's wild Smith River , the last major undammed , undiverted river in the state . <p> While pesticide controversies are commonplace in other parts of the state , they are virtually unknown in largely conservative Del Norte County ( population 28,000 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 million bulbs for greenhouses  --  the Westbrooks , the Hastings , the Stanhursts , the Itzens , among them  --  are family businesses . Some trace roots back to the 1800s , some to World War II , when U.S. growers began to make up for Japanese production lost after the bombing of Pearl Harbor . <p> The families are part of community life as well as an economic mainstay for the region , producing a $6.6 million annual crop , the only major field crop left in Del Norte . <p> " You do n't want the lily bulb growers to lose their living , " said Dorlas Wilson , a retired school bus driver who moved to Smith River more than 40 years ago . " We 've already lost our logging , our fishing . All we have is Pelican Bay State Prison . You ca n't live on beauty . " <p> But Wilson learned in June that her well and those of her son and daughter , who own houses nearby , are contaminated with a carcinogenic insecticide once widely used by the lily growers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the Smith River Project , the Trees Foundation and the Humboldt Watershed Council  --  ran an ad in the local newspaper for free testing . Now Wilson is buying bottled water for her grandchildren , and she worries about all the people who might not know of contaminated wells . <p> ON-AND-OFF TESTING <p> In the 1980s , the insecticide  --  1,2 dichloropropane  --  was found in about 80 percent of 45 wells in the lily-growing belt . In 1983 , the state suspended both 1,2-DCP and aldicarb , another pesticide found in the wells . But since then , testing by the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board has been rare . <p> Testing began again in 2001 and 2002 , after repeated requests from the environmental groups . The persistent 1,2-DCP was found in 11 wells . <p> Tuch Vath , engineering geologist at the regional water board , said he would like to do more testing , and not just of well water .

Bald eagles and spotted owls feed in the watershed , and 38,000 rare migratory Aleutian geese gather on the river plain , among the lily fields , before returning each spring to Alaska . <p> What makes the region right for redwoods also makes it good for lily bulbs , growers say . The Smith River estuary provides a mild climate and rich alluvial soils . But the 75-inch average rainfall also brings pest problems  --  and hence , according to growers , the need for pesticides . <p> The lily bulbs are cultivated on 800 acres between the Smith River and Chetco River watersheds , hugging either side of Highway 101 along the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the southern islands of Japan , are rotated and culled for three years until they reach commercial size . During that time , they 're vulnerable to a host of pests , including root-eating nematodes , or worms , and fungi . <p> POTENT CHEMICALS <p> Altogether , on the California side of the lily-bulb belt , growers used about 200,000 pounds of 50 chemicals in 2001 , according to state reports . Many are highly toxic , including chloropicrin and carbofuran , which kills raptors and threatens groundwater . <p> Several pesticides  --  the carcinogenic chlorothalonil and disulfoton and pentachloronitrobenzene  --  pose threats to endangered coho and Chinook salmon and steelhead , according to scientists with the Center for Ethics and Toxics , a nonprofit in Gualala ( Mendocino County ) founded by pesticide expert Marc Lappe . <p> The center has turned over its study for review by the endangered species protection program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . <p> SORE THROAT , BLOODY NOSE <p> Smith River resident Jack France , a truck driver whose home is next to lily fields , worries about uncontrolled pesticides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I know the dangers of pesticides to livestock and runoff to the salmon . " <p> France photographed a cloud of pesticides wafting into his yard and across the street last year . His children got nosebleeds and sore throats . He dismantled his outdoor pool and sent the children to a school out of the neighborhood . <p> " I do n't want them to stop growing lilies . But if they 're going to work in this area , they need to be responsible , " France said . <p> The growers are doing a good job of following regulations , said Glenn Anderson , the county agricultural commissioner in Crescent City , who has regulatory authority over pesticide use . <p> " I 've been here for 27 years come June , and the last 10 or 11 as commissioner . We get pretty good compliance , " Anderson said . " There 's always pressure to reduce pesticides and use the less toxic ones . But when you need it , you 've got to use it . " <p> GROWERS NEED PESTICIDES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with green shutters , John Westbrook , the family patriarch , and his wife , Carolyn Spencer Westbrook , say they would like to curtail chemicals . <p> " John and I have talked about other ways to grow lily bulbs for years , " Carolyn Westbrook said . But they just have n't been able to solve the pest problems , she said . <p> They feel the pressure from the environmental groups is putting their livelihood and land at risk . <p> Their son , Matt Westbrook , a recent graduate of California State University at Chico who wants to step into the business with his brother , says , " I do n't want to see chemicals as much as the next person . I want to fish and hunt . " <p> He believes pesticides are n't causing any problems . <p> The growers have tried tricks over the years to kill nematodes and fungus  --  sowing cracked crab shells into soil to release a natural insecticide , covering the ground with plastic and trying to produce hybrids with traits that resist pests , plant breeder Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Netherlands who sells to a Marin County marketer , Organic Bouquet , lists woes on the Web site that would discourage anyone from trying to go organic . <p> But Organic Bouquet 's founder , Gerald Prolman , is optimistic . His former company , Made in Nature , sold organic bananas , mangoes , peppers , eggplants , tomatoes and other vegetables at Safeway , Kroger and other chains . <p> " It 's been done with every crop , so there 's no reason it ca n't be done with lily bulbs , " he said . " That 's not to say it 's easy . It takes quite a commitment to look at new and some old-fashioned ways of farming . Not to make any effort at all is unacceptable .
