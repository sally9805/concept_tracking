" I loved the word that Sam P. Allen , of Toledo , Ohio , and Naples , Florida , submitted to describe " the human condition that prevents motorists from passing a police patrol car " : arrestlessness .

But Dan Schechter , of Los Alamitos , California , explained it best and so takes top honors . Schechter wrote , " Some California Highway Patrol officers call the phenomenon the halo effect .
