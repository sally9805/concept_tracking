It is n't cheating if everybody else is doing it . " So declared Canadian track coach Charlie Francis in 1988 when his sprinter Ben Johnson became the Olympics ' highest-profile disqualification ever by testing positive for steroids . But of 8,465 competitors at Seoul , only Johnson and nine others were booted for drugs . What 's this about " everybody " ? <P> Good question , tough answer . You can be sure that many more than 10 athletes used banned substances in Seoul , and many more than 10 will use them in Sydney . Beyond that , there 's little certainty . As you watch the events on the tube , you will have no way of knowing if you are seeing a clean or dirty event , a real athletic competition or a duel between pharmacists . <P> That 's because , say its critics , neither will the International Olympic Committee . " I think right now every performance in an endurance event is suspect , " says Frank Shorter , the former gold-medal marathoner who is chairman of the new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the U.S. Olympic Committee in October . <P> Not so , says Craig Masback , chief executive officer of USA Track and Field , the governing body in the U.S. for a sport with a druggie reputation . He insists these Games will be , by and large , clean : " The Olympics are the most tested sports movement in the world . I believe the vast majority of athletes are n't on drugs . " Counters Shorter : " Anybody can look at a dirty athlete and know he 's dirty . All bulked up . His face changing ... " Masback says , " You ca n't ban an athlete because he looks suspicious . That 's why there are tests . " And , he adds , " it 's unfortunate that old athletes who want their records to continue to shine are shouting about how everyone today is cheating . " <P> Fellas , let 's move on . <P> Masback 's arguments notwithstanding , the prospects for cheaters have never been better , because drug testing as it has existed heretofore means little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subsequent lawsuits in nations that enjoy due process ( read , the U.S. ) , has set its " dirty " bar extremely high . And most cheaters are careful to choose hard-to-detect drugs or stop their intake well in advance of expected tests . <P> It 's not news that any athlete carefully monitoring his intake could take banned substances and still pass Olympic tests . We now know that by 1978 East German athletes in every sport except sailing were being given anabolic steroids . Yet in 1976 and 1980 not one East German tested positive for drugs at the Summer Games . The country took home a total of 216 medals , 87 of them gold , from those Olympics .
