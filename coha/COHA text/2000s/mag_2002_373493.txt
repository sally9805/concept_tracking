It bears the least surprising title in memory , but this authorized biography by the group 's longtime publicist is n't all cheerful cliche . It 's rife with little-known facts : McNally reports that roughly half the band experimented with Scientology . Yet McNally 's greatest asset is not his inside gossip but his encyclopedic knowledge of the ' 60s counterculture . The book loses some charm halfway through , when constant touring takes over , making this 684-page tome much like a Dead show . Only fans will sit through the whole thing , but moments of drama and virtuosity abound .  --  By Benjamin Nugent
