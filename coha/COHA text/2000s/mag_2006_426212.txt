Far from being just a story about " the patriarchs , " the Old Testament is full of surprising stories about courageous women who keep salvation history on course . // When teaching Bible classes in parishes , I often begin with the question , " When I say " characters of the Bible , " what names come to mind ? " The consistency of the list is quite remarkable : Jesus , Paul , Moses , Saul , Solomon , David , Abraham , Isaac , and some of the prophets , such as Isaiah and Jeremiah , figure as regulars among the first responses . The naming continues with the identification of less familiar players : Joshua , Nathan , Joel , Jonah , James , John , and Thomas . ItIs commendable how many characters surface . But as the brainstorming dies down , I often note the glaring absence of women 's names from the list . Mustering a response , folks quickly chime in : Mary , Mary Magdalene , Sarah , Rebekah , Rachel , Leah . But then the recitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . In fact , it is not my students ' fault that the only familiar names of women in the Bible are the Marys of the New Testament and the matriarchs of the Old . For most people the biblical stories featured in the lectionary readings each week form the basis of their familiarity with the Bible , and , as John Baldovin , SJ. regrettably notes in Bread of Life , Cup of Salvation ( Rowman &; Littlefield ) , even in its revisions the lectionary features very few stories about women . But even those who read and study the Bible on its own might be hard pressed at first to identify biblical women . As we well know , these are patriarchal stories composed and passed down in patriarchal cultures . Not surprisingly men appear as the most conspicuous players and protagonists . But there are many notable female characters and heroes across scripture . A few , including Ruth , Esther , and Judith , emerge as especially prominent . That whole books are named after them in a patriarchal setting suggests the magnitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while still others appear only briefly . Taken together these female characters reveal the role women played in sustaining and defending the chosen people . In a family way Ruth , in the book named after her , emerges as a towering protagonist and unmatched critic of culture , custom , and common sense . Living in the land of Moab , she and another Moabite woman , Orpah , marry into an Israelite family that fled Israel because of famine . Soon after the story begins , the mother , Naomi , and her two daughters-in-law are all widowed . This new social standing places all of them , but especially old Naomi , among society 's most vulnerable . Orpah returns to her Moabite family , but Ruth refuses to abandon her mother-in-law and travels with her to Bethlehem , Naomi 's Israelite village . Like Abraham who leaves his land , Ruth leaves behind the unfamiliar to her . But unlike Abraham , Ruth receives no divine promise of land and descendants as incentive . Instead , she clings to Naomi , an old widow at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go , I will go , and wherever you reside I will reside . Your people will be my people and your God will be my God " ( Ruth 1:16 ) . The magnitude of this profession of solidarity remains unmatched in the biblical tradition . Once in Bethlehem , Ruth 's initiative-first finding food and eventually securing a new marriage-renews the life of both women . In the end Naomi , who had succumbed to bitterness in her plight , is transformed by her daughter-in-law 's ingenuity and fidelity . Indeed , Ruth deserves the praise that the women of the village exclaim before Naomi as she cradles her new grandson , Ruth 's son : " Ruth , your daughter-in-law , who loves you , is more to you than seven sons " ( Ruth 4:15 ) . // Judith-and her maidservant , carrying evidence of the decapitated general-proves to have more courage than Israel 's military leaders . // Ruth is not alone as a life-sustainer . Tamar , a Canaanite woman , also acts in the interest of life , assuring heirs for her dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , Tamar marries an Israelite who dies before they have any children . The brother of the dead man refuses to fulfill his legal responsibility of producing offspring to raise up in the name of his deceased brother , so he dies as well . Judah , the father , refuses to give Tamar his only other son , fearing the same fate will visit him . So when Judah 's own wife dies , Tamar sets out to fulfill the legal duty that Judah has thus far avoided , providing offspring for her deceased husband through a male relative . Setting aside her widow 's garment , she veils herself as a prostitute . Not recognizing her , Judah has sex with her in exchange for his seal , its cord , and staff pin-signs of his identity and authority-as a pledge . Later , when word comes to Judah that his daughter-in-law is pregnant , Judah orders her to be burned to death . She confronts him with the symbols of his identity , and he recognizes that she has taken on the obligation he has refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the praise Judah proclaims of Tamar : " She is far more righteous than I " ( Gen. 38:26 ) . Similarly the women of Exodus 1-2 demonstrate the determination of less prominent women to inspire us to overcome forces of violence and to cooperate with one another as agents of divine power in sustaining life . First , two God-fearing midwives , Shiphrah and Puah , disobey the Egyptian pharaoh 's order to kill every male child born to the enslaved Israelite people . Whether these women are Egyptian or Hebrew remains unclear , but the grave consequence they would reap for their defiance of such an oppressive ruler is certain . Next , Moses ' mother rebels against the Egyptian ruler 's order to throw all male Hebrew babies into the Nile . Instead she hides her son for three months and then prepares an ark-like cradle for him to float among the reeds on the river 's edge . When the pharaoh 's own daughter and her maidservants find the basket , the princess herself acknowledges that the child is Hebrew and arranges for his sustenance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she too defies her father and acts to save Moses'life . Hence , Israel 's central tradition , the Exodus , does not begin with the great liberator Moses . Instead , a diverse group of women-Hebrew and Egyptian , slave and royal , young and old-act together as instruments of God 's saving power . They cross lines of ethnicity , social standing , and age in the interest of Moses ' life . It is the saving activity of women that heralds the beginning of Israel 's freedom from bondage . Saviors of the people Esther 's life-giving story , like Ruth 's , unfolds in a book bearing her name . She also works to bring life to others , but unlike Ruth , who restores a family , Esther saves her whole people . Though an Israelite , Esther rises to become queen at the Persian court . She first exposes a plot to kill the Persian king and later uses this political edge to intercede with this same ruler . Uncovering the wicked court official Haman 's plot to execute her uncle Mordecai for his failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scheme to destroy all the Jews in Persia . In doing so she not only saves her people but preserves their right to worship Yahweh alone . Judith , another courageous liberator , also puts her life on the line to protect and liberate her village . The book bearing her name was composed about 100 years before the birth of Jesus . However , the story describes an Assyrian invasion of Israel approximately 400 years earlier . The destruction of Judith 's small town of Bethulia by the powerful Assyrian forces that have besieged it appears certain . The enemy has called for its surrender and promised to annihilate the citizens living there . Judith , a pious widow , acts in the face of inescapable destruction . Removing her widow 's garment , she dresses herself graciously and styles her hair in high Greco-Roman fashion . So striking and unbelievable is her appearance that she walks right through the enemy lines uninterrupted and presents herself to Holofernes , the powerful Assyrian commander . Captivated by her beauty , Holofernes invites her to dine with him , and Judith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( kosher food ) she brought along in a bag , Holofernes eats excessively and gets drunk . When he falls at her feet in a stupor , she wastes no time in eliminating his tyranny . Employing the bravest of tactics among ancient warriors , Judith decapitates the Assyrian general with his own sword and puts his head in her bag . Returning to the city the way she came , Judith carries with her the evidence that Holofernes ' era of violence has ended . Upon hearing the news of their leader 's assassination by a woman , the whole Assyrian army flees . Thus Judith shows herself to have more courage and faith than any of the military leaders in Israel . Other stories of women in Israel who work to rescue their community from enemy terror appear throughout the biblical tradition but are less well known . In the book of Judges , Jael and Deborah are clear protagonists in the tale of Israel 's victory over the Canaanite threat . While Deborah works as both a prophet and military strategist leading the people in battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Judith , Jael unhesitatingly woos Sisera , the exhausted Canaanite commander , into her tent . Never considering the danger to herself , she takes advantage of her enemy 's need for food and rest . Then while he sleeps , Jael seizes what " weaponry " she has in her domestic surroundings . With tent peg in hand , Jael nails Sisera 's head to the ground and brings an end to the Canaanite oppression . According to the code of ancient warfare , the death of such a feared warrior as Sisera at the hands of a woman deals a humiliating blow to the enemy and earns greater safety for vulnerable Israel . Indeed she is worthy of the commendation with which the Bible praises her , " Blessed be Jael by women " ( Judg.5:24 ) . Foreign friend Like Jael , Rahab works within the confines of her domestic sphere to bring about salvation for a people that are not even her own . Unlike Jael , the Bible introduces her as a Canaanite . Known as Rahab " the harlot " in the tradition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case out Jericho before the Israelites enter the Promised Land . It is worth noting that Josephus , a Jewish historian of the first century , refers to her as " Rahab , the innkeeper . " In the patriarchal world of the Bible it was highly irregular for a woman to run a business . Hence , the pejorative title " harlot " in the biblical story may have been a way of drawing a ring of suspicion around such an enterprising woman . The king of Jericho seems to have no qualms about communicating with Rahab , though . He requires her to turn over the spies . In response , Rahab feigns ignorance , saying that the men had departed . In the meantime she hides the agents beneath bundles of flax on her roof and alerts them when it is safe to depart . As they are leaving , Rahab confesses her belief in Israel 's God and appeals for mercy when Israel attacks . Her courage , forthrightness , and faith win Rahab and her household protection . Moreover , the bravery and political savvy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her name figures among the few women in Matthew 's genealogy of Jesus ' ancestry , suggesting the honor with which she was regarded . Thus even women with " questionable " reputations , along with so many other commendable mothers , queens , maidservants , and women religious leaders of our biblical traditions , offer important lessons about the different ways God acts in the midst of humanity . Such stories of courage , determination , commitment , and holiness are waiting to be read and preached from a revised lectionary . Failing to do so not only deprives us all of the lessons taught by the heroism , courage , and self-sacrifice of those who are not front and center in these tales , it also diminishes our ability to recognize and honor their counterparts in our own times . How we read and interpret the stories of such an important book as our Bible is closely related to how we " read " and take seriously the stories of all the people of our world . In our ever-shrinking global village , the urgent need to better understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human community needs little explanation . Look for the February issue of U.S. CATHOLIC , in which Barbara Reid , O.P. unearths the forgotten women of the New Testament .
