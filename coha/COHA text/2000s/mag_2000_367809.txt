There are a few ineluctable facts about buildings . They are expensive , time consuming and labor intensive to make . They are strongest if built from the sturdiest materials . Well , no , on all counts . Japanese architect Shigeru Ban has built homes , pavilions and churches , some of them permanent , using little more than cardboard tubes . " I was interested in weak materials , " says Ban , 42 . " Whenever we invent a new material or new structural system , a new architecture comes out of it . " Ironically , Ban may be closer to the old modernist ideals than many who build today in glass and steel . He wants beauty to be attainable by the masses , even the poorest . <P> Ban first began to use the tubes in the ' 80s , in exhibitions . Impressed by the material 's load-bearing capacity ( he calls cardboard " improved wood " ) , he thought of them again in 1995 , after the Kobe earthquake , and used donated 34-ply tubes to build a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shipped paper log houses to Turkey and Rwanda . " Refugee shelter has to be beautiful , " he says . " Psychologically , refugees are damaged . They have to stay in nice places . " <P> But it 's not all about utility . Ban has managed to turn ugly-duckling cardboard into some gorgeous swans . The Japanese pavilion he created for this year 's EXPO 2000 in Hannover , Germany , is a huge undulating grid of paper tubes enclosed , like a covered wagon , with a paper canopy . A nine-ton , 87-ft. - long lattice arch of tubes currently swoops over the garden at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City , casting a thatch of ever changing shadows . <P> Ban 's designs touch the earth lightly in more ways than one . After EXPO 2000 , his pavilion will be shipped to a recycling center to be returned to the pulp from whence it came . Just try that with bricks . <P>  --  By Belinda Luscombe               @ @ @ @ @ @
