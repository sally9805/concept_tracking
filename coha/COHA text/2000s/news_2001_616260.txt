<p> Lines clearly drawn The use of stem cells from embryos for research is a new development , but both sides of the ethical debate have strong opinions . <p> Embryos have humanity ; their rights are being violated <p> All human beings alive today have passed through an embryonic stage on their way toward birth , childhood , adulthood and final maturity . There can be no rational doubt about the humanity of human embryos . <p> Yet , false , glory-hungry scientists are willing to kill them in order to harvest cells and tissues vital for the existence of their unwilling donors . Where are the human rights identified in the Bill of Rights ? W.A. KROTOSKI Krotoski , of Baton Rouge , La. , is a retired physician with the U.S. Public Health Service and president of the Louisiana Right to Life Federation . <p> Think of greater good for all of society <p> When I think of the potential benefits of stem-cell research and relate them to the greater good , I think of doctors and nurses who ease the suffering of others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soldiers and veterans who bear witness to the tragedies of war . <p> I think of teachers , scientists and engineers . Farmers , factory workers , bus drivers , construction workers , burger flippers and everyone who in their own way support the lives of others . Most of all , I think of mothers , fathers , sisters and brothers . <p> What do we lose when these people are taken from us ? Would n't it be in support of the greater good to explore avenues that would allow all people to participate in life to the fullest ? CRAIG WILLIAMS , Atlanta <p> Some harvesting done without consent <p> Having a family member with an illness that could possibly be cured with stem-cell research , I read Jay Bookman 's article with great interest ( " Divided over stem cells , " @issue , July 8 ) . <p> I could n't help but be struck by the irony of the ethical arguments against this technology . Every day in this country we harvest tissue from living , viable human beings who have not given their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Foreskins removed from infant baby boys in American hospitals today during non-religious circumcisions are used without the original owners ' consent to grow football fields of human skin to heal burn victims . We seem to have no problem with this type of tissue harvesting . <p> For those who are worried about the right to life of cells dividing in a petri dish , I ask : What do you say about the victims who have a voice to protest the removal of their tissue but whose cries fall on a nation of deaf ears ? DIANE JOHNSON , Acworth <p> Looking at big picture , proponents ' beliefs at odds <p> Regarding the debate over stem-cell research : Note the doublethink required to be an advocate of both stem-cell research and abortion . <p> We first must hold that the embryo is not yet a living person and therefore not entitled to basic human rights . We then we must also hold that this embryo has died with its parents ' decision not to attempt a pregnancy . How can we have pre-life and post-life simultaneously ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep fighting <p> The real point of the stem-cell argument is that eternal question : what constitutes a life ? It seems that we are searching for a line to draw . <p> My line extends to the sidewalk that surrounds the home where my sister lives . It forms the two bedrooms where her children sleep . It turns to flow up the stairs and forms the chair where her husband sits . The line continues down the street . You can follow it to my home and to that of our other sister and to those of friends . <p> The line and its path are clear . My sister has Lou Gehrig 's disease . Her voice has been silenced . Her spirit has not . <p> Right now , there is no cure for this devastating , fatal disease . Stem-cell research offers her hope , a reason to keep fighting . <p> People opposed to stem-cell research should meet my sister ; then they would know the true meaning of the sanctity of life . KERRY McDONELL HALASZ , Alpharetta <p> ISRAEL : Daily activities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life continuing in Israel . Despite the adverse travel publicity and travel bans , the title highlighted that people perform daily activities , whether we live in Tel Aviv , Sandy Springs or Oklahoma City , and somehow we get through . PAULA SOMMER , Atlanta <p> No sympathy for those who destroy Palestinians <p> A recent article presented a reporter 's endearing experiences in a state that forcefully occupies another people 's land and identity ( " Life Goes On , " Travel , July 8 ) . <p> I do not sympathize with the economic plight of Israeli citizens whose government had virtually destroyed the Palestinian economy with a brutal military occupation . <p> Yes , life goes on for Israelis , while Palestinians are getting killed . GHASSAN GHRAIZI , Atlanta <p> REBEL FLAG : Knowledge of history lacking <p> Once again Cynthia Tucker has shown her ignorance of our government and history while chastising others for the same ( " Allow students to wear symbols of Confederacy , " Editorial , July 8 ) . Since she seems to dislike the Rebel flag , she chastises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorabilia as wrongheaded . <p> Tucker seems to throw around the word " democracy " a lot . We are not a democracy . We are a constitutional republic . A democracy is a mob type of government . LARRY KRUEGER , Lawrenceville <p> U.S. flag has n't always been a symbol of unity <p> Cynthia Tucker 's recent column about T-shirts in Albany had some good points . <p> I agree that parents should help determine what their kids wear to school . The parents in this case probably have prompted the kids to wear shirts with the Confederate battle flag on them . Perhaps the school administrators could have prevented this by having rules about all distracting logos and images on clothing . <p> I take exception , however , to her reference to the U.S. flag being a unifying banner . Let us not forget that slavery was legal in the United States until 1863 . Therefore , the U.S. flag , with its quickly growing number of stars , represented a nation where slavery was legal . <p> Let 's talk about other atrocities under the Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , the concentration camps for the Japanese-Americans in World War II , etc . JIM SUTHERLAND , Atlanta <p> Act of treason had precedent <p> Cynthia Tucker 's commentary on students wearing the rebel flag on their T-shirts in Albany was as usual , well thought out and well-written . <p> In discussing the Confederate flag , however , Tucker makes the point that " it was hardly appropriate for a state Capitol to fly a flag that represented treason . " Is she aware that flying the Stars and Stripes also represented treason against a mother country ? JIM MOORE , Atlanta <p> South 's defeat has long-term benefits <p> While reading Cynthia Tucker 's column , I recalled a recent conversation I had with an individual who clings to the states ' rights argument . I let him have his say , and then I told him that he and others like him should get down on their knees and thank the United States for having the foresight and determination to wage war against the South and ultimately prevail in restoring the Rebel states to their proper place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been no possibility of defeating Germany in World War I or World War II because there would n't have been a United States to mount the heroic and monumental effort that was needed to defeat the Axis powers . <p> Yes , the South did lose , and it should be very glad . KENNETH C. STAHL , Tucker <p> Anti-gun bias shows in stories <p> I find it ironic that one day after an " Inside the AJC " article by Mike King claimed that the Journal-Constitution does n't slant the news , there is a front-page article , leading to a series of " guns are bad " stories , parroting the left-wing talking points of the United Nations ' effort to eradicate possession of guns by private citizens ( " Illegal Soviet weapons fuel wars around world , " News , July 8 ) . <p> Throughout the articles , we are led to believe that it was n't the wars that caused death and misery ; Oh , no , it was the guns . But only the guns not controlled by governments . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were possessed by civilians . <p> The guns used by patriots in the American Revolution would be deemed illegal by U.N . standards . Can you say " police state , " children ? <p> Can any article that repeats , with no balance at all , demonization of a nearly obsolete personal weapon of the ordinary infantryman , technology perfected in 1947 , as a " weapon of mass destruction in slow motion " be anything other than propaganda ? <p> I suppose a riding lawn mower is really an Indy 500 race car " in slow motion . " Does the staff at the AJC really not even see the bias ? ROBERT CAMP JR. , Kennesaw <p> Allow bikers , skaters to enjoy Oak Hill <p> I 'd like to commend the Piedmont Park Conservancy on the marvelous job it did with the rehabilitation of Oak Hill . I looked forward to Oak Hill 's reopening with great anticipation and pride . My fervor turned into grave disappointment , however , when I was barred from viewing Oak Hill on my bicycle or on inline skates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve as much green space as possible by narrowing the width of the paths . What I did n't expect was the absolute prohibition of some of the best means to enjoy the park and its expansion . I find it hypocritical that the Conservancy would allow other wheeled " vehicles " on Oak Hill , such as baby strollers and children 's ' scooters , both of which may be more than five times the width of a bicycle . <p> I implore the conservancy and the city of Atlanta to rescind the restriction on bicycles and inline skates on Oak Hill immediately . It is time for the rest of us to be able to enjoy this terrific restoration  --  not just those who walk . BRIAN PEARLMAN , Atlanta <p> Cartoonists ' depictions of Bush are accurate <p> The article and commentary from editorial cartoonists who regularly provide illustrations of George W. Bush was quite interesting ( " The many faces of George W. Bush , " @issue , July 8 ) . <p> Bush has joked that he was scholastically challenged , and his lack of command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media have praised him for his good-natured charm , could it be that indeed there is basically nothing intellectually in Bush to see ?
