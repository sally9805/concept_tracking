Alone in the basement , Jeanne Boylan sketched into the night . She did n't even stop to eat , afraid if she did , she might never continue . <p> For more than 20 years two faces had haunted her . In nightmares , she could still hear them taunting her , two strangers who , on a lonely country road , stole long and unforgettable hours of her life . <p> Even today , Boylan talks about the attack haltingly . " I just wanted to forget , " she says . " To get on with my life , not to feel they had taken anything more than that one night . " <p> In fact , Boylan acknowledges now , that night determined every decision about her life since . It began her journey of exploration into the workings of the human mind . And it began her transformation into who she is today , a woman with a remarkable gift , one that helps capture murderers and madmen . <p> The living room was dark and cluttered - as dark and cluttered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and glared at the woman with the sketchpad . All week long they had grilled her , police , FBI , the lie-detector technician . <p> Now another stranger was trying to dredge her mind , to bring her back to the moment a week earlier when an intruder burst into the bedroom and dragged her friend Polly into the night . <p> Boylan had seen it so many times before - the anguish of eyewitnesses as they struggle to remember details their minds want to forget , the pressure from police to get those details as quickly as possible . <p> " At that point , no one knew if Polly Klaas was alive or dead , " Boylan said of the 12-year-old snatched from a slumber party in Petaluma , Calif. , in 1993 . " And locked in her memory , this child held the key to finding her . " <p> Boylan 's job was to unlock the image , to coax the kidnapper 's portrait from the child 's head . <p> She placed a lump of Play-Dough on the table . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be ? " <p> The child scowled . Hours passed . Gradually they began to talk - about piano and soccer and boys and school . About siblings . They never mentioned features - eyes or nose or hair - or facial expressions . Just shapes and forms and textures . <p> Eventually , the girl reached for the Play-Dough . As she talked , Boylan sketched , her mind locked with the girl 's , her hand translating the shapes and forms and textures into a face - the face of a man with coarse , wavy hair , heavy eyes and a deeply furrowed brow . <p> Richard Allen Davis was arrested six weeks later and charged with the murder of Polly Klaas . <p> " His face was a mirror image of the one Jeanne had sketched , " said Mark Mershon , the FBI agent in charge , who said the portrait contributed to the arrest . " It gave me goosebumps . " <p> She 's known as a facial identification specialist but there 's really no label for what Boylan does . She crawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away layers of confusion and pain . She guides people back to the moment when they saw something so horrific their minds never want to go there again . And yet they do , because she makes it safe . <p> " I listen , " Boylan says . " I just listen and I sketch what I hear . " <p> But those who know her work and have witnessed its results say she does so much more . <p> Boylan has sketched countless criminal profiles , helped investigators with thousands of cases : Polly Klaas , the Oklahoma City bombing , New York 's East Side rapist . And her most famous sketch of all - the haunting , hooded portrait of Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski . <p> Boylan 's picture was so accurate Kaczynski broke his nose so he would no longer look the same . <p> " Jeanne has a gift , " says Marc Klaas , Polly 's father and one of Boylan 's closest friends . " And her gift is a blend of compassion and psychology and art . It is a phenomenon that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately , that her skill is not a gift but a method that can be taught . Drawing the face of a killer has little to do with art , she says . And it has little to do with the traditional methods of police composite artists . It has to do with understanding the human mind . <p> No one knows quite what to expect when Boylan sweeps onto a crime scene , tall and statuesque with her mane of golden hair and her slim black bag of tools . <p> Hollywood , thought Klaas , when he first encountered her . Another meddling civilian , thought FBI agent Mershon . He sent her home . Now he calls on her for the most complicated cases . <p> " Jeanne makes believers of us all , " Mershon says . <p> But it took a long time . It took a long time for Boylan herself to understand the profession she sometimes says " chose " her . <p> It began in the late 1970s in Portland , Oregon . In her twenties and still dreaming of being a journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police department , conducting follow up interviews with eyewitnesses . <p> At the time , she knew nothing about memory , how easily it can be led in wrong directions , even with the best of intentions . <p> But what she saw troubled her : eyewitnesses being asked to choose noses and eyes to piece together what they thought they had seen , using images from a standard police book of 960 faces . The results were flat , two-dimensional composites of suspects who only vaguely resembled human beings . <p> Boylan started sketching during interviews , asking witnesses about shapes rather than specifics . <p> She learned a lot along the way . She learned when people witness something under trauma , their minds often remember details vividly , like a flashbulb going off . She learned that those details are retrievable if they are protected , and if they are allowed to surface gently without additional stress . <p> Too often , she argues , investigators bombard witnesses with questions : Did he have a mustache , a beard , glasses ? Because memory is so vulnerable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And those hastily sketched composites turn into the image they only thought they saw . <p> " What people see , " Boylan says , " is evidence as fragile and valuable as a fingerprint . And it should be protected with as much care . " <p> Some in law enforcement are wary of her methods , which can sound more psychic than sleuth . Often Boylan is called in as a last resort - long after memories have been distorted . <p> In the case of the Unabomber it was seven years later . <p> He was America 's most wanted killer , a phantom bomber targeting computer companies , university professors and airlines . By 1994 , after a 15-year spree , the Unabomber had killed three people and wounded 29 . <p> Just once he slipped up - when a secretary at a computer company in Salt Lake City caught a glimpse of a hooded man in sunglasses placing a package under a car . A short time later , it exploded , seriously injuring her boss . <p> The woman , whose identity was protected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again and again she told them it was not quite right . <p> And so , seven years later , the call went out : Let 's see what Jeanne Boylan can do . <p> Her portrait did n't crack the case , but it made Boylan famous . And for a time , she pursued the fame and the glamour , welcoming the chance to be heard and to get paid . The Unabomber sketch appeared on the cover of Newsweek . Talk shows flew her in for interviews . She wrote a book . She even co-hosted " America 's Most Wanted " for a time . <p> It seemed like everyone wanted a piece of the " psychic artist " . And everyone wanted to know her secret . <p> " What I do is no great mystery , " Boylan says , a trace of frustration in her voice . " It has to do with allowing someone the freedom and the time to remember . " Mostly , she adds , " It has to do with the human heart . " <p> But working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : April 1995 . Bits of building mixed with babies ' blood . The smell of death . Eyewitnesses more traumatized than Boylan had ever seen . <p> The FBI had already arrested Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols and was seeking a third suspect , a so-called " John Doe . " Hundreds of people had called , convinced they had spotted him . Boylan 's job was to work with the most promising eyewitnesses and produce a portrait . Fast . <p> It was an impossible task . It was n't even clear that the eyewitnesses had seen the same person . And yet the world was demanding that Boylan deliver . Work your magic now , it seemed to cry . Find us the face of a killer . <p> " Everyone expects too much , " she sobbed over the phone to Marc Klaas , after collapsing in her hotel room in exhaustion . <p> Klaas ca n't remember what he said to comfort her . He just remembers being there , as Boylan had been there when they buried his daughter . <p> " She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warrior . Too bad she is paying such a cost . " <p> Boylan acknowledges the personal price . Her four-year marriage collapsed . She barely had a social life . She 's never sure how she will be paid . <p> Again and again she vowed to quit , to get a " real life , " to be " normal . " And then the phone rings one more time . <p> " How do you say no , " she asks , " when the FBI is on the line asking you to help catch the Unabomber ? " <p> Besides , how does she stop when she 's slowly winning converts ? <p> People like Mershon , the FBI agent in charge of the Polly Klaas case . He was so impressed by Boylan that , a month later , he asked for her help in a kidnapping case in Antioch , Calif . The wife of a jeweler had been snatched from her home by two armed men . Before being blindfolded , her husband saw one of the kidnappers . <p> Remembering the lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't show the witness the usual book of suspects . He did n't grill him about who he had seen . <p> " They guarded his memory as fiercely as a fingerprint , " Boylan said . " It made my job easy . " <p> The suspect was arrested four days after Boylan 's picture was released . His youthful , dimpled face was identical to her portrait . The hostage was freed , unharmed . <p> The East Side rapist case in New York was not so easy . <p> For a week in 1997 , Boylan worked individually with seven of the 13 victims . Linda Fairstein , chief of the sex crimes prosecution unit of the Manhattan District Attorney 's office said she had never seen anyone who could get eyewitnesses to so " willingly go back into their mind 's eye . " <p> Boylan 's widely circulated portrait did n't lead to the rapist 's arrest , but it apparently scared him off . There have been no attacks linked to the suspect since . <p> " Without the magic of Jeanne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accurate portrait of this monster , " Fairstein said . " When he is caught , there is no doubt in my mind that he will be astounded by the likeness . " <p> Boylan shakes her head . <p> It 's not magic , " she says . " It 's just a different way of doing things . " <p> " I want houseplants , " Boylan says in her Arizona condominium , the first home she has ever owned . " And a dog . " <p> Her place is small and cozy . Candles flicker by the fireplace . Soft music plays in the background . Water trickles over stones on a fountain-style tabletop . Everything - right down to the silverware - is brand new . <p> Not a trace of her work or the faces that have consumed her life . Just some family photos of her parents and siblings , taken when she was growing up in Montrose , Colo . <p> She chose this place to get away from her past . She chose it because it 's sunny and vibrant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And because nobody here knows who she is . She asks that the location not be disclosed . <p> " My new life , " she thrills . " My SIMPLE new life ... " <p> But nothing is so simple in a life that has witnessed so much . There was something Boylan had to do before she came here , something she had avoided for a long time . <p> For years , she never mentioned her own attack , not to family , not to friends . She was a crusader , not a victim . And crusaders fight for others . <p> But Boylan 's crusade had taught her a lot about victims . It taught her that by confronting their tormentors - even on paper - they can purge the horror from their lives . She had seen it so many times , the visible transformation when she finally showed someone her portrait . Some wept . Some screamed . One woman , a nun who had been raped four times , burned Boylan 's portraits in a ceremonial purging of her soul . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to purge her own . She pulled out her 15-by-18 inch pad . She picked a No. 2 pencil . And as she had done thousands of times before , she began sketching , chipping away at memory , as the cold , leering eyes slowly appeared on the page . <p> It was hours before her pencil stopped moving . Hours before she could bring herself to look at the faces on the pad . <p> She stared at them for just a few moments . She knew she would never see those faces in her mind again . <p> End Advance for Feb. 18 <p>
