So I 'm on my way to work and I stop to watch a pigeon fight a rat in the snow , and some fuckhead tries to mug me ! Naturally there 's a gun . He comes up behind me and sticks it into the base of my skull . It 's cold , and it actually feels sort of good , in an acupressure kind of way . " Take it easy , Doc , " he says . <p> Which explains that , at least . Even at five in the morning , I 'm not the kind of guy you mug . I look like an Easter Island sculpture of a longshoreman . But the fuckhead can see the blue scrub pants under my overcoat , and the ventilated green plastic clogs , so he thinks I 've got drugs and money on me . And maybe that I 've taken some kind of oath not to kick his fuckhead ass for trying to mug me . <p> I barely have enough drugs and money to get me through the day . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to first do no harm . I 'm thinking we 're past that point . <p> " Okay , " I say , raising my hands . <p> The rat and the pigeon run away . Chickenshits . <p> I turn around , which rolls the gun off my skull and leaves my raised right hand above the fuckhead 's arm . I wrap his elbow and jerk upwards , causing the ligaments to pop like champagne corks . <p> Let 's take a moment to smell the rose known as the elbow . <p> The two bones of the forearm , the ulna and the radius , move independently of each other , and also rotate . You can see this by turning your hand from palm up , in which position the ulna and radius are parallel , to palm down , where they 're crossed into an " X. " They therefore require a complicated anchoring system at the elbow , with the ligaments wrapping the various bone ends in spoolable and unspoolable ribbons that look like the tape on the handle of a tennis racket . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the fuckhead and I have a worse problem right now . Namely that while my right hand has been fucking up his elbow , my left , having somehow come into position by my right ear , is now hooking toward his throat in a knife-edge . <p> If it hits , it will crush the fragile rings of cartilage that keep his trachea open against the vacuum of breathing in . Next time he tries , his windpipe will clench shut like an anus , leaving him at ReaperTime minus maybe six minutes . Even if I ruin my Propulsatil pen trying to trache him . <p> So I beg and plead , and coax the trajectory of my hand upwards . Past the point where it 's aiming for his chin , or even his mouth-which would have been disgusting-to where it 's aiming for his nose . <p> Which caves in like wet clay . Wet clay with twigs in it . The fuckhead crashes to the pavement , unconscious . <p> I check to make sure I 'm calm-I am , I 'm just annoyed-before getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of work , as in every kind of work , probably , planning and composure are worth a lot more than speed . <p> Not that this particular situation requires much planning or composure . I roll the fuckhead onto his side so he wo n't choke to death , and bend the arm that is n't broken under his head to keep his face off the frozen sidewalk . Then I check to make sure he 's still breathing . He is , in fact with a bubbly joie de vivre . Also the pulses at his wrists and ankles are reasonably strong . <p> So , as is usual in these situations , I imagine asking the Great One-Prof . Marmoset-whether I can leave now . <p> And , as is also usual in these situations , I imagine Prof. Marmoset saying No , and What would you do if he was your brother ? <p> I sigh . I do n't have a brother . But I know what he 's getting at . <p> I put my knee into the guy 's fucked-up elbow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to bear , then let them come slowly back together into their positions of least resistance . It makes the fuckhead groan in pain in his sleep , but whatever : they 'd just do the same to him in the ER , only by then he 'd be awake . <p> I frisk him for a cell phone . No such luck , of course , and I 'm not about to use my own . If I did have a brother , would he want me getting hassled by the cops ? <p> So instead I pick the fuckhead up and fold him over my shoulder . He 's light and stinky , like a urine-logged towel . <p> And , before I stand , I pick up his handgun . <p> The gun is a real piece of shit . Two pieces of pressed sheet-metal-no grips , even-and a slightly off-center cylinder . It looks like something that began life as a starter pistol at a track meet . For a second it makes me feel better about there being 350 million handguns in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets and am reminded how little it takes to kill someone . <p> I should throw it out . Bend the barrel and drop it down a storm drain . <p> Instead , I slip it into the back pocket of my scrub pants . <p> Old habits die harder than that . <p> In the elevator up to Medicine there 's a small blond drug rep in a black party dress , with a roller bag . She 's got a flat chest , and the arch of her back boosts her ass , so she 's shaped like a sexy , slender kidney bean . She 's twenty-six after a bit too much sun exposure , and her nose is the kind that looks like a nose job but is n't . Freckles , I shit you not . Her teeth are the cleanest things in the hospital . <p> " Hi , " she says like she 's from Oklahoma . " Do I know you ? " <p> " Not yet , no , " I say . Thinking : Because you 're new on this job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Are you an orderly ? " she asks . <p> " I 'm an intern in Internal Medicine . " <p> An intern is a first-year resident , one year out of medical school , so typically about six years younger than I am . I do n't know what an orderly is . It sounds like someone who works in an insane asylum , if there are still insane asylums . <p> " Wow , " the drug rep says . " You 're cute for a doctor . " <p> If by " cute " she means brutal and stupid-looking , which in my experience most women do , she 's right . My scrub shirt is so tight you can see the tattoos on my shoulders . <p> Snake staff on the left , Star of David on the right . <p> " You 're from Oklahoma ? " I ask her . <p> " Well yes I am . " <p> " You 're twenty-two ? " <p> " I wish . Twenty-four . " <p> " You took a couple of years off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a boring story . " <p> " It 's okay so far . What 's your name ? " <p> " Staaaaacey , " she says , stepping closer with her arms behind her back . <p> I should say here that being chronically sleep-deprived is so demonstrably similar to being drunk that hospitals often feel like giant , ceaseless office Christmas parties . Except that at a Christmas party the schmuck standing next to you is n't about to fillet your pancreas with something called a " hot knife . " <p> I should also maybe say that drug reps , of whom there is one for every seven physicians in the U.S. , get paid to be flirtatious . Or else to actually fuck you-I 've never been quite clear on that . <p> " What company do you work for ? " I ask . <p> " Martin-Whiting Aldomed , " she says . <p> " Got any Moxfane ? " <p> Moxfane is the drug they give to bomber pilots who need to take off from Michigan , bomb Iraq , then fly back to Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run the engine . <p> " Well yes I do . But what are you gon na give me in return ? " <p> " What do you want ? " I say . <p> She 's right up under me . " What do I want ? If I start thinking about that , I 'll start crying . Do n't tell me you want to see that . " <p> " Beats going to work . " <p> She gives me the play slap and leans over to unzip her bag . If she 's wearing underwear , it 's not of any technology I 'm familiar with . " Anyway , " she says , " it 's just things like a career . Or not having three roommates . Or not having parents who think I should have stayed in Oklahoma . I do n't know that you can help me with that . " <p> She stands up with a sample pack of Moxfane and a pair of Dermagels , the Martin- Whiting Aldomed eighteen-dollar rubber gloves . She says , " In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I 've tried them , " I say . <p> " Have you ever tried kissing someone through them ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Neither have I. And I 've kind of been dying to . " <p> She hip-checks the elevator " stop " button . " Oops , " she says . <p> She bites the cuff of one of the gloves to tear it open , and I laugh . You know that feeling where you 're not sure whether you 're being hustled or in the presence of an actual human being ? <p> I love that feeling . <p> " The ward is a fucking nightmare , " Akfal , the other intern on my service , says when I finally show up to relieve him . What " Hello " is to civilians , " The ward is a fucking nightmare " is to interns . <p> Akfal is a J-Card from Egypt . J-Cards are graduates of foreign medical schools whose visas can be rescinded if they do n't keep their residency directors happy . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hands me a printout of current patients-he 's got one too , though his is marked up and heavily creased-and talks me through it . Blah blah Room 809 South . Blah blah colostomy infection . Blah thirty-seven-year-old woman for regularly scheduled chemotherablah . Blah blah blah blah blah . It 's impossible to follow , even if you wanted to . <p> Instead I 'm leaning back against the nursing station desk , which is reminding me that I 'm still carrying a handgun in the inside pocket of my scrub pants . <p> I need to stash the gun somewhere , but the locker room is four floors away . Maybe I should hide it behind some textbooks in the nurses ' lounge . Or under the bed in the call room . It does n't really matter , as long as I can focus enough to remember where I put it later . <p> Eventually Akfal stops talking . " Got it ? " he asks me . <p> " Yeah , " I say . " Go home and get some sleep . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home nor get some sleep . Akfal will go do insurance paperwork for our residency director , Dr. Nordenskirk , for at least the next four hours . <p> It 's just that " Go home and get some sleep " is intern for " Goodbye . " <p> Rounding on patients at five thirty in the morning usually turns up at least a handful of people who tell you they 'd feel fine if only you assholes would stop waking them up every four hours to ask them how they 're feeling . Other people will keep this observation to themselves , and bitch instead about how someone keeps stealing their m player or medications or whatever . Either way , you give the patient the once-over , keeping a particularly sharp lookout for " iatrogenic " ( physician caused ) and " nosocomial " ( hospital caused ) illnesses , which together are the eighth leading cause of death in the United States . Then you flee . <p> The other thing that sometimes happens when you round early on patients is that none of them complain at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The fifth or sixth room I enter is that of Duke Mosby , easily the patient I currently hate least . He 's a ninety-year-old black male in for diabetes complications that now include gangrene of both feet . He was one of ten black Americans who served in Special Forces in World War II , and in 1944 he escaped from Colditz . Two weeks ago he escaped from this very room at Manhattan Catholic Hospital . In his underpants . In January . Hence the gangrene . Diabetes fucks your circulation even if you wear , say , shoes . Thankfully , Akfal was on shift at the time . <p> " What 's going on , Doc ? " he says to me . <p> " Not much , sir , " I tell him . <p> " Do n't call me sir . I work for a living , " he says . He always says this . It 's some kind of army joke , about how he was n't a commissioned officer or something . " Just give me some news , Doc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rarely seems to interest him , so I make up some shit about the government . He 'll never find out differently . <p> As I start bandaging his reeking feet , I say , " Also , I saw a rat fighting a pigeon on my way to work this morning . " <p> " Yeah ? Who won ? " <p> " The rat , " I tell him . " It was n't even close . " <p> " Guess it figures a rat could take a pigeon . " <p> I say , " The weird thing was that the pigeon kept trying , though . It had its feathers all puffed out and it was covered with blood . Every time it attacked , the rat would just bite it once and throw it onto its back . Go mammals , I guess , but it was pretty disgusting . " I put my stethoscope on his chest . <p> Mosby 's voice booms in through the earpieces . " That rat must have done something pretty bad to that pigeon to make it keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . I push his abdomen around , trying to elicit pain . Mosby does n't seem to notice . " Seen any of the nurses this morning ? " I ask him . <p> " Sure . They been in and out all the time . " <p> " Any of the ones in the little white skirts , with the hats ? " <p> " Many times . " <p> Uh huh . You see a woman dressed like that , it 's not a nurse , it 's a strip-o- gram . I feel the glands around Mosby 's neck . <p> " I got a joke for you , Doc , " Mosby says . <p> " Yeah ? What 's that ? " <p> " Doctor says to a guy , ' I got two pieces of bad news for you . First one is , you got cancer . ' Man says , ' Lordy ! What 's the second one ? ' Doctor says , ' You got Alzheimer 's . ' Man says , ' Well , at least I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like I always do when he tells me that joke . <p> In the bed by the door of Mosby 's room-the bed Mosby had until the ward clerk decided he 'd be less likely to escape if he was five feet farther from the door-there 's a fat white guy I do n't know with a short blond beard and a mullet . Forty-five years old . Lying on his side with the light on , awake . When I checked the computer earlier , his " Chief Complaint " - the line that quotes the patient directly , thereby making him look like an idiot-just said " Ass pain . " <p> " You got ass pain ? " I say to him . <p> " Yeah . " He 's gritting his teeth . " And now I got shoulder pain too . " <p> " Let 's start with the ass . When did that start ? " <p> " I 've already been through this . It 's in the chart . " <p> It probably is . In the paper chart , anyway . But since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that a judge can subpoena , there 's not much incentive to make it legible . Assman 's looks like a child 's drawing of some waves . <p> As for his computer chart-which is off the record , and would contain any information anyone actually felt like giving me-the only thing written besides " CC : Ass pain " is " Nuts ? Sciatica ? " I do n't even know if " nuts " means " testicles " or " crazy . " <p> " I know , " I say . " But sometimes it helps if you tell it again . " <p> He does n't buy it , but what 's he going to do ? <p> " My ass started to hurt , " he starts up , all resentful . " More and more for about two weeks . Finally I came to the emergency room . " <p> " You came to the emergency room because your ass hurt ? It must really hurt . " <p> " It is fucking killing me . " <p> " Even now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much Dilaudid , he should be able to skin his own hand with a carrot peeler . <p> " Even now . And no , I 'm not some kind of drug addict . And now it 's in my fucking shoulder , too . " <p> " Where ? " <p> He points to a spot about midway along his right collarbone . Not what I 'd call the shoulder , but whatever . <p> Nothing 's visible . " Does this hurt ? " I say , poking the spot lightly . The man screams . <p> " Who 's there ! ? " Duke Mosby demands from the other bed . <p> I pull the curtain aside so Mosby can see me . " Just me , sir . " <p> " Do n't call me sir- " he says . I let the curtain fall back . <p> I look down at Assman 's vitals sheet . Temp 98.6 , Blood Pressure 120/80 , Respiratory Rate 18 , Pulse 60 . All totally normal . And all the same as on Mosby 's chart , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ward this morning . I feel Assman 's forehead like I 'm his mother . It 's blazing . <p> Fuck . <p> " I 'm ordering you some CT scans , " I tell him . " Seen any nurses around here lately ? " <p> " Not since last night , " he says . <p> " Fuck , " I say out loud . <p> Sure enough , a woman five doors down is flat-out dead , with a look of screaming horror on her face and a vitals sheet that reads " Temp 98.6 , Blood Pressure 120/80 , Respiratory Rate 18 , Pulse 60 . " Even though her blood 's so settled at the bottom of her body that it looks like she 's been lying in a two-inch pool of blue ink . <p> To calm myself down I go start a fight with the two charge nurses . One 's an obese Jamaican woman busy writing some checks . The other 's an Irish crone cruising the Internet . I know and like both of them-the Jamaican one because she sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a full-on beard she keeps shaved into a goatee . If there 's a better Fuck You to the world than that , I do n't know what it is . <p> " Not our problem , " the Irish one says , after I 've run out of things to complain about . " And nothing to do about it . We had that pack of Latvian cuntheads on the overnight . Probably out selling the lady 's cell phone by now . " <p> " So fire them , " I say . <p> It makes both nurses laugh . " There 's a bit of a nursing shortage on , " the Jamaican one says . " Case you have n't been noticing . " <p> I have been noticing . Apparently we 've used up every nurse in the Caribbean , the Philippines , and Southeast Asia , and now we 're most of the way through Eastern Europe . When the white supremacist cult Nietzsche 's sister 's founded in Paraguay re-emerges from the jungle , at least its members will be able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the certificate , " I say . <p> " Sterling . And fuck the Pakistani , eh ? " the Irish one says . Her face is remarkably close to the computer screen . <p> " Akfal 's Egyptian , " I say . " And no , I 'm not leaving it for him . I 'm leaving it for your Latvian shitheels . Stat . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
