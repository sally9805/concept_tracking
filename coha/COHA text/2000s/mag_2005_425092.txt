Hollywood 's married women are just like you-except for the palatial mansions , wealthy maids , and shameless nepotism . Says one : " Yeah , if I did n't know me , I 'd hate me too . " By Jessica Shaw // IF YOU GOOGLE THE TERM HOLLYWOOD WIVES , THE first responses that are generated-of course- relate to Jackie Collins ' 1983 trashtastic novel about a group of backstabbing , partying , oversexed bimbettes who made Faustian beauty-for-bucks pacts with their husbands . Scroll down a couple more entries and you 'll find gossip-column staples like Jessica Simpson and Reese Witherspoon dogged by such provocative questions as " After the bridal bouquet has been caught ... how do couples like Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick keep their relationship going strong , despite busy showbiz schedules ? " ( It 's called a nanny. ) * You have to comb through 10 more pages to actually find a " civilian " Hollywood wife-one whose Starbucks habits are n't monitored by Page Six . And it turns out Gigi Levangie Grazer , spouse of Brian " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Starter Wife , has plenty to say about the less glamorous side of power matrimony in Hollywood . " It 's not like being a housewife . There 's all this upkeep . More stuff owns you . It becomes important who you vacation with , where you vacation , who 's there . " She continues : " Your life is scheduling and appointments and maybe putting your kids to bed . " Wait , but that last part sounds exactly like being a wife anywhere-be it Hollywood , Calif. , or Hollywood , Fla . As ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY spent time traversing the hills and crisscrossing the canyons of the L.A. area , lunching at starlet-friendly restaurants , and hearing one sordid divorce saga on a deck with no view , we found these women 's lives far more complicated and nuanced than a Jackie Collins novel or Liz Smith column can portray . There are the privileges ( Pilates sessions : daily , private ) you 'd expect ; an insecurity you would n't ( " Being married to someone well-known , there 's an adjusting that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All in the Family and The Jeffersons creator Norman . " You have that whole " Who am I in this relationship ? I 've done a lot too ' ' " ) . There are stereotypes confirmed ( the incestuous social network ) and debunked ( black-tie benefits = total nightmare ) . Most wives donate time and money to causes . A majority of them love the perks that come with their famous last names-one wife even got a career out of it . Here 's what it 's like to live in Hollywood , the ultimate company town , where everybody is married to the CEO . Gigi Levangie Grazer " It 's dangerous to come into contact with me , " laughs Gigi , biting into a lettuce leaf , her muscularly minuscule figure disappearing into the couch cushions at her Pacific Palisades home . Unlike the legions of inner-circle wives who adhere to the **34;3514;TOOLONG code , Gigi loves to dish . And dish she will , but not before playfully covering up a reporter 's tape recorder mic to gossip about a high-profile broadcast network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TV star 's horrid plastic surgery . Overshare No. 421 : " I could n't have sex when I was pregnant because I would throw up , " she says , dissing her Starter Wife jacket photo , which was taken while she was expecting . If you 've read the delightfully sudsy novel about a big-time studio head who leaves his wife for Britney Spears ( which is being adapted into a USA Network miniseries for next year ) , you probably recognize the line . Busted ! " Oops ! " she giggles , considering some of the other book details that might be taken for truth . Pause . " I swear that line in the book was not real : Brian does not shave his b  --  s . " Of course , if her husband of eight years-yes , the Oscar-winning producer of A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13-did take a razor there , you get the sense you 'd be hearing all about it . " People tell me stories or behave in certain ways that I have n't seen since seventh grade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I gained 15 pounds from the baby ' and then tells you that the baby was born from a surrogate , it 's a gift . " For all of her seemingly idle chatter , Gigi is acutely aware of the image she projects : the girl from the wrong side of the tracks who , through wit and talent , landed in a life of privilege . ( A privileged life that came in handy at the passport agency earlier that day when she slipped someone $500 to cut in line . ) And Gigi is the first to deride it all . The subject of the Grazers ' second home in Malibu comes up and she snaps , " Yeah , because everyone needs a beach house 20 minutes away . " Trophy wives ? " They all have the same face . " Her place in Hollywood ? " I think of myself as an outsider , " she insists . " At least I like to think of myself as outside the fishbowl . " It 's an eye-rolling declaration , but it 's also what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " well-compensated " maid to inject fat into God knows where-immensely likable . She happily offers her age ( 42 ) , confesses she 's felt postpartum depression ( " I was on Effexor for two weeks " ) , and is used to getting the once-over from young actresses ( " I 'm confusing to people . I 'm not pretty enough to be a bimbo " ) . Instead of holing up in Malibu , overlooking the Pacific , to write , Gigi spends weekdays at the Office , a mass of tables and plush chairs in Santa Monica for struggling writers who ca n't afford private writing rooms . The relatively monastic environment seems to have spurred her productivity . She 's deep into her next novel-about a couple who fall back in love after getting divorced-and is finishing a script about a kidnapping in broad daylight , as well as shopping around a pilot called The Colony , about a posh Malibu community ... which just happens to be produced by her husband 's company . " Believe me , I get the same notes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second . " Yeah , if I did n't know me , I 'd hate me too . " Lynette Carolla and Gina Kimmel On a sunny afternoon inside an unmarked mansion-turned-spa in the San Fernando Valley , a photo-negative version of The Man Show is being exposed . Today 's topic is ... the beauty benefits of penile foreskin ! Our hosts : Lynette Carolla , wife of Adam , and Gina Kimmel , ex-wife of ABC late-night host Jimmy . " It 's called human fibroblast , " laughs Lynette . " It smells bad but it 's great ! " Adds Gina , " My joke is , Over the years guys have always told you that putting their ...

Ten years ago , Lynette and Gina were a couple of girls who forged an unlikely bond : Sisterhood of the Plus-One . " When you 're dating a comedian , you have all these events to go to . I 'd see Lynette every weekend , look over , nod , smile , and occasionally get stuck sitting next to her , " says Gina . " Finally , we just started talking , and then we became a foursome . " And on weekends , a twosome . While Adam and Jimmy watched football , Gina and Lynette would get together for spa treatments . " We would just sit around bitching about life , gossiping , drinking wine , and getting our faces lasered , " adds Gina . The more girl weekends they spent together , the more they realized how much they despised the tony celebrity-frequented day spas of the landscape . " The rainwater music makes me have to pee !

With an unofficial motto of " Detox . Botox . Then Retox ! " they launched LushSpa last February with third partner Kim Sudhalter . Treatments are named for alcoholic drinks : The Margarita ( salt scrub ) , The Dirty Martini ( facial mud mask ) , and an off-the-menu massage treatment for PMS clients in the know called The Bloody Mary . Unlike some of the town 's higher-profile spas , Lynette and Gina 's offers a full lineup of medical services , including Botox and laser tattoo removal , courtesy of Dr. Bruce Heischober , a regular on Adam 's former KROQ show , Loveline . " Everyone should be able to have that stuff done in a fun but discreet place , " Gina says . " We want people to feel like they 're celebrities . " Though Lynette , 36 , and Gina , 40 , do n't advertise their connections , they are aware of what a well-known surname can do for business . Soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the following morning Gina had received 113 e-mails . " We 're realistic . We know it 's an eye-catcher , " admits Lynette . Adds Gina , " But it 's not like anyone showed up and said , " Oh my God . Can I get Jimmy Kimmel 's autograph ? ' ' " After all , most of Adam and Jimmy 's fans are n't clamoring for Merlot massages . " Occasionally , some dumb guy who 's a big fan of The Man Show will be nice to us because of our last names , " says Lynette . " But the Jewish lady down the street is n't going to put it together .... Let 's face it : Adam and Jimmy are no Matt Damon and Ben Affleck .

Courtship was n't easy . There was a 25-year age difference and the fact that Norman , who 'd been married twice and had three grown daughters , felt too old to revisit daddydom . ( He relented and the couple have a son , 17 , and twin daughters , 11 . ) The early days of matrimony held their own challenges . Even if the pert blonde did n't have the pedigree of a trophy wife , she looked the part . His friends , still close with his previous wife , Frances , were initially chilly . " It took a few years of adjusting , " Lyn says . " But now all of his old dear friends are old dear friends of mine . As I would hope . We 've been married 18 years already .
