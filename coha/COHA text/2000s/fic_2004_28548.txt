Chapter One Manhattan " ZANE , IS IT TRUE that you and Gisella had a secret wedding last weekend in Cancu'n ? " the blond reporter from the Star shouted . The noise level rocketed as camera crews and microphones crowded the hotel ballroom at the press conference for Zane MacAllister 's latest film . Zane resisted a groan . He 'd known that the snapshot of him with the supermodel would be fresh meat for the tabloids . " Thanks for the vote of confidence , Heather , but I just met the woman a week ago when we attended the same preview party . " He winked . " I 'm sure a famous beauty like her can do better than some ole small-town Texas boy . " The assembled reporters hooted . The blonde named Heather batted her eyelashes at him . Fresh off an Oscar nomination and just named " Sexiest Man Alive " by People magazine , Zane MacAllister was the hottest star in Hollywood at the moment . Life was sweet . He was enjoying the heck out of it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the litter was only too aware of what life could be like on the flip side of good looks and fame . And if he forgot , his older brothers , Diego , Jesse and Cade , would gladly bring him back to earth . He missed them , missed his mother and father , his pesky younger sister , Jenna . Two more stops on this publicity tour for his new release , then he had six weeks off before his next film . He could n't wait to head home to Texas and hibernate for a while . As the director fielded questions , Zane listened with half an ear , scanning the crowd without really seeing . He was so tired . His ex-girlfriend Kelly 's middle-of-the-night call had kept him tossing in his bed . They had n't been an item in months , not since he 'd finally realized that she did n't want to kick her cocaine habit , that no matter what help he offered , she was n't ready to accept . It frustrated the hell out of him . The waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in his business dragged down by the fast life . Kelly was well on her way to being another casualty , no matter how hard Zane had fought to save her . " Zane has no comment on that . " The tension in his publicist Annie Schaefer 's voice alerted Zane that he 'd missed a question . That the room had fallen unnaturally silent . " So she 's just another disposable girlfriend ? " jeered a voice from the back . " What ? " Zane turned to Annie . " What 's he talking about ? " " Get up and leave - now , " she whispered , hand over Zane 's microphone . " I 'll handle this . " Zane almost obeyed - he 'd had plenty of experience with the landmines the press could plant - but something in the gathering buzz of the audience , something about the shock in Annie 's eyes , kept him in place . " Tell me what 's going on , " he demanded . A reporter spoke up first . " Her brother says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed herself because you abandoned her when she told you she was pregnant . Not exactly what we 've come to expect from All-American Zane MacAllister , is it ? " Dead ? Zane could n't speak . Kelly ... pregnant ? His mind went white . How could - Last night she 'd cried on the phone but refused to tell him why . She 'd begged him to come back , but she 'd been high and hysterical and - He jerked the mike toward him . " When she called , she never mentioned - " The buzz leaped to a roar . " You mean she called you before she did it ? " " What did you say to make her kill herself ? " " You did n't want the baby ? " How could it be his ? They had n't made love in - Annie grabbed the mike back . " This news comes as a terrible shock to all of us . Mr. MacAllister will have a statement later . " She flipped off the microphone , nudging him none too gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand them something like that . Let 's get out of here . " " But - " Zane looked out at the crowd as though somewhere in it lay the answers . " Forget them - " she snapped . " They 're piranhas , ready to feed . " Her tone gentled . " You 're rattled . I do n't blame you . I 'll phone some sources from the suite , see what I can find out . " He turned blind eyes to her . " She never said - " He glanced away . " I did n't let her finish . I thought it was just the same old - " The crowd still clamored , shouting questions as he walked through the door in a daze . He 'd hung up on Kelly in disgust only hours ago . Given up on her , at last . In so doing , had he driven her to give up on herself ? ( Continues ... )                   @ @
