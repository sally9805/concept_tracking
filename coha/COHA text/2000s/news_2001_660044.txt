<p> Mercury , the Rodney Dangerfield of planets , is finally getting respect . For some 25 years , the tiny planet could light a fire under only a handful of solar-system scientists . After Mariner 10 's three fly-bys in the mid-1970s , many astronomers dismissed the planet as too boring - too much like Earth 's moon to be worth the price of an orbiter . Now , however , Mercury 's stock is rising . Last fall , the European Space Agency approved an ambitious 2009 mission - a pair of orbiters and a surface probe - to study the first rock from the sun . The United States is building a Mercury orbiter for launch in 2004 . And Japan hopes to launch its own Mercury mission in 2005 . This mini-armada is being aimed at Mercury for several reasons , the planet 's faithful say . Dramatic discoveries during the past decade , such as radar evidence for water ice in polar craters and features that return radar echoes unlike any others in the solar system , have piqued scientists ' cur-iosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages . And , perhaps most important , scientists discovered an approach to getting there that cuts mission costs . Whatever the reasons , Mercury 's die-hards say it 's about time their planet commanded a place on FIRST ROCK FROM THE SUN : <p> the exploration itinerary . " Mercury has been horribly neglected , " complains Robert Strom , a planetary geologist with the University of Arizona 's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory who played a key role on the imaging team for the Mariner 10 mission . Indeed , researchers say that they know less about Mercury than about any other planet but Pluto . Yet , they add , unraveling Mercury 's secrets is vital to understanding the formation of the rest of the inner planets , which also include Venus , Earth , and Mars . Mercury 's mysteries arise from its extremes . With a diameter that would allow it to fit comfortably between Boston and Anchorage , Alaska , it 's a planetary munchkin . Its orbit traces an ellipse around the sun , while those of the other inner planets are more nearly circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as long as its " year , " which is 88 Earth days long . Temperatures on its sunny side reach a withering 800 degrees F. at the equator . In the deepest recesses of polar craters , temperatures never top minus 274 degrees F. <p> Dense , but not clueless No planet is more dense than Mercury . And it is the only inner planet besides Earth that displays a global magnetic field . Yet unlike Earth , Mercury 's enormous iron core is thought to be frozen , lacking the molten , flowing layers that set up Earth 's planetary magnet . Quite apart from its physical attributes , Mercury holds a soft spot in many a physicist 's heart . The planet provided the first full test of Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity , which he successfully invoked to explain why Mercury 's closest approach to the sun shifts from orbit to orbit . For astronomers , however , Mercury tends to reveal its secrets only grudgingly . Mountaintop telescopes have had a tough time viewing the planet because it orbits close to the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Mercury never rises far above the horizon , astronomers have to look at it through more of Earth 's atmosphere , which blurs Mercury 's features . Last year , scientists from Boston University announced that they had successfully tested a prototype telescope camera to study Mercury 's tenuous atmosphere . In the process , they supplied the first surface images from a region of Mercury that Mariner 10 missed . But the ability to study surface features in any detail from the ground remains elusive . The Hubble Space Telescope , which might be able to return spectacular images , is forbidden to view Mercury ; the sun would fry the orbiting observatory 's instruments . This has left the field to two contestants - spacecraft and ground-based radar . In November 1973 , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) launched Mariner 10 , which was designed as a reconnaissance mission in preparation to send an orbiter , Dr. Strom says . The mission made the first accurate mass measurement of the planet , discovered its exceedingly thin atmosphere and its magnetic field , and produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos have sustained Mercury 's hard-core students ever since . The images were given a fresh look in 1997 , when Mark Robinson , now a Northwestern University planetary geologist , and Paul Luci from the University of Hawaii subjected the images to new processing techniques . They built up a color photo that gave researchers fresh insights into the volcanic processes that helped shape Mercury 's surface . Their images also yielded evidence that Mercury 's chemical composition was different from that of the other inner planets . " Mariner 10 gave us some very fruitful data , " says Dr. Robinson , who is on the science team for the upcoming US mission to Mercury . If astronomers have been pleased with Mariner 's data , they were flabbergasted with results from radar . In 1991 , researchers " pinging " Mercury 's surface with radar signals discovered what they interpreted to be evidence of water ice deep in north polar craters . The craters were visible to radar because the orbits of Mercury and Earth are slightly offset . " Finding ice was a huge shock , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planetary Institute in Houston . Since then , researchers have found evidence of ice at both poles , with further radar studies planned for later this year . While some planetary scientists caution that the signals could be showing sulfur deposits , rather than ice , others who lean toward the ice explanation hold that the evidence is more compelling than the evidence the recent Lunar Prospector mission mustered for water ice in lunar craters . Strom points out that radar is finding other features that demand a closer look . In 1996 , radar data showed what looked like an enormous shield volcano nearly 400 miles across . The feature never showed up in Mariner images because of Mariner 's limited coverage . The radar signatures are strong enough to suggest that if the formation is a shield volcano , it may have formed fairly recently . " It could be as big as Mons Olympus on Mars , " Strom adds . What he finds truly intriguing , however , are mysterious radar signatures that defy description - a collection of bright dots some 1,200 miles in diameter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar system , " he says . With such morsels on their plates , it 's little wonder that planetary scientists are eager to return for seconds . <p> Messenger 's 5-year journey One opportunity comes in 2004 , when NASA is scheduled to launch the Messenger mission , which would arrive at Mercury in 2009 and orbit the planet for 12 Earth months . The five-year journey includes two Mercury flybys , which will supply close-up images of parts of the planet no human has seen before . In addition , flybys of Earth and Venus will help Messenger catch up with its fleet quarry . " If you do n't do that , Mercury would zip by at 10 kilometers a second , " or about 22,000 miles an hour , making for a short visit , says Sean Solomon , a Carnegie Institution scientist and Messenger 's lead researcher . The instrument package for the $ 286 million project is designed to help answer a range of questions , Dr. Solomon explains . " Mercury is the densest planet . How did it wind up mostly metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about the size of Earth 's moon . It is covered by a relatively thin layer of rocky material about 370 miles thick . One explanation holds that Mercury formed as a metal-rich object in roughly its current location . Another suggests that Mercury wandered among the other budding planets , taking hits from passing planetesimals ( small rocks that formed planets ) that stripped it of much of its outer cover of rock . Clues to which explanation is right will come from analyzing the chemical composition of the surface minerals from orbit . Another puzzler is Mercury 's magnetic field and the processes that generate it . To unravel that knot , researchers must figure out if Mercury , like Earth , has a liquid core . " If Mercury has a liquid core , the planet 's equator should do a slight twist in orbit " as the sun 's gravity tugs on it , says Maria Zuber , a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , in Cambridge . Dr. Zuber notes that the twist is small - on the order of about 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations in topography to within about 20 inches , as well as making gravity measurements , she will look for the telltale twist . Evidence of water on the moon and Mercury could provide clues about Mercury 's origins , adds Strom . If the evidence for water on the moon is truly from water , the source for both objects is likely to be passing comets , he says . But if the lunar readings are n't water at all , but an artifact of the sun 's interaction with the moon 's surface , " then what is that stuff on Mercury ? " he asks . One possible source would be volcanoes , he says . Models that try to explain Mercury 's origins also predict characteristics like sulfur content , he notes . Additional information should come from the European Space Agency 's Bepi Colombo mission . The mission , scheduled for launch in 2009 , consists of two orbiters and a surface probe . Instead of using standard chemical propellants , Bepi Colombo 's planners hope to use an ion propulsion system similar to one being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en route to Comet Borrelli this September . Planners hope it will cut the mission 's travel time to half that of Messenger 's . One of Bepi Colombo 's two orbiters will carry an instrument package similar to Messenger 's . The other craft will travel through the teardrop tail of Mercury 's magnetic field to study the planet 's " space weather . " Looking at the range of missions heading toward the first rock from the sun during this decade , MIT 's Zuber lays out what could become a bumper sticker for Mercury missions : It 's time has come . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
