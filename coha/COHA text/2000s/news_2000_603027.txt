<p> To paraphrase the famous question Ronald Reagan asked in 1980 : Are you better off today than you were eight years ago ? <p> You 'd better believe it . <p> As the nation prepares to choose its first president of the new millennium , Americans are feeling extraordinarily good  --  about the country , the economy , their own futures , even the political process . <p> That sense of broad-based contentment and optimism is the dominant theme in the first of a series of " Election 2000 : Mood of America " surveys by USA TODAY , CNN and the Gallup Organization . <p> But the glowing outlook is n't translating into a strong vote of confidence in the man who has tied his political future to these prosperous times : Al Gore . <p> According to the survey conducted last weekend , a staggering 83% are satisfied with the state of the economy ; 73% believe they are better off personally than they were in 1992 ; and 69% are content with the way things are going in the USA . <p> Perhaps most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two-thirds believe the next generation will have a chance for a better life than their parents had . Sixty percent believe a poor person can still get ahead through hard work . <p> " There are a lot of opportunities out there for everyone if they are willing to work hard and get a good education , " says Fran Foley , 45 , a registered nurse in Spencer , Mass . " If they want to get ahead , they can . " <p> The feel-good mindset is a remarkable turnaround from eight years ago , when 74% were unhappy with the direction of the country and President Bush lost his bid for reelection . At the time , barely 40% were optimistic that future generations would prosper . <p> Now , Americans are feeling so upbeat about their own lives that they have become far less cynical about the political arena . Three of four say there is a candidate running this year who would make a good president . When Bush left office , only 40% were enthusiastic about the candidates . <p> Although optimism is at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily for years along with the economy and the stock market . " The economy is good , and things have improved on social issues such as crime , " Ohio State University professor Herb Asher says . <p> The poll results should come as terrific news to Vice President Gore . After all , he is the political heir to Bill Clinton , who has presided over these boom times . History says the party in power during an era of peace and prosperity retains the White House . Gore is in the best position to reap the political rewards . <p> Yet a majority of voters do n't seem inclined to give Gore credit for the nation 's good fortune . To the contrary , the vice president suffers from his association with Clinton . Though 63% approve of Clinton 's job performance , 64% disapprove of his character . <p> The survey shows Gore trailing Texas Gov . George W. Bush by 9 percentage points among likely voters . Pitted against Arizona Sen. John McCain , Bush 's chief rival for the Republican nomination , Gore 's deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley , is still far behind the vice president in the race for the nomination , but he makes a stronger candidate against the GOP front-runners . The poll shows Bradley running virtually even with both Bush and McCain . <p> In an odd way , the economy 's strength ultimately might work against Gore . People feel so flush and confident that they are taking the good times for granted and focusing on other issues , such as character and leadership qualities . <p> " People are saying , ' Would n't it be neat to have a good economy and a president who is admirable and a strong leader ? ' " Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker says . " Gore is seen as damaged goods , and voters do n't see Bush or McCain doing anything that would wreck the economy . " <p> Lasting fallout from Clinton 's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky could be one reason 72% of the respondents in the survey expressed dissatisfaction with the moral values in the country , a theme the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress what it describes as weak global leadership during Clinton and Gore 's watch . Fifty-four percent of those polled said the United States is less respected around the world than it was eight years ago . <p> Gore also is saddled with a stern public demeanor that clashes with these " do n't worry , be happy " times , Emory University political scientist Merle Black says . " When Gore talks about problems , he genuinely looks worried and makes them sound worse than they are . " <p> Gore 's political plight is captured in the attitude of 50-year-old Gerald Kolander , a retired postal worker from China , Texas . The Democratic-leaning independent is happy with the conditions in the country but does n't give Gore any of the credit . <p> " I just do n't like the way he puts himself across , " Kolander says . " He has a long explanation for everything . He always sounds like he 's trying to make a sale . Bush seems to have more insight on how things are done . " <p> Banking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up for with winning issues . The Democrats have an edge on some domestic priorities that Americans believe have been left untended during the economic boom . <p> Majorities in the survey said not enough has been done to make health care more available and affordable , or to deal with the nation 's poor and homeless people . The Democratic Party is considered the champion of these causes . But Bush is trying to claim those issues for Republicans by playing up his " compassion " for those Americans left behind and using the campaign slogan " Prosperity with a purpose . " <p> Gore , borrowing the Clinton campaign mantra from 1992 , plans to remind voters that " It 's the economy , stupid . " <p> When a record for the longest economic expansion in U.S. history is set in February ( 107 months ) , voters can bet Gore will be at Clinton 's side to trumpet the achievement . " Gore will be sticking to the economy as closely as a stamp sticks to an envelope , " Baker says . <p> Gore press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nomination and the White House once voters focus on the race as a choice between " continuing on the same prosperous track and making a right-wing U-turn . " <p> Gore 's advisers note that the public mood was less upbeat in 1988 . Yet voters gave the Republicans another term in the White House by electing the elder Bush , who trailed in the polls at this time 12 years ago . <p> Still , the economy has a more powerful impact on the public when times are bad because the government bears the brunt of the blame . A resounding " no " to Reagan 's question " are you better off " signaled Jimmy Carter 's downfall in 1980 . Clinton used the same theme to defeat the elder Bush 12 years later . <p> In good times , the government is less likely to get primary credit . " The government is not responsible for the economy , " Bradley told a group of business executives in New Hampshire this month . " It 's the entrepreneurs , it 's the private sector , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontent helps <p> If this feel-good election is proving an unexpectedly tough challenge for Gore , it 's causing even bigger problems for third-party candidates . <p> They do best in times of high voter discontent , such as in 1992 , when Texas billionaire Ross Perot got 19% of the vote and helped tilt the election to Clinton . In 1996 , with the economy on the upswing and the electorate 's mood improving , Perot managed just 8% of the vote and was a non-factor in the contest . <p> The latest USA TODAY poll shows that only 1 in 20 voters would support either conservative commentator Pat Buchanan or New York real estate mogul Donald Trump , who are vying for the Reform Party nomination this year . <p> " Third-party candidates suffer in an optimistic environment , " Democratic pollster Alan Secrest says . <p> Congressional incumbents , on the other hand , should do just fine . Even in bad times , they usually win . Now , a thin majority of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing . Voters rarely give lawmakers high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of the public 's unusually expansive attitude toward politicians in Washington . <p> Three of four likely voters say their own congressman deserves re-election , and 57% say all members of Congress deserve another term . In 1994 , when Republicans took control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years , only 23% approved of the job Congress was doing . <p> The latest poll augurs well for the GOP 's hopes of retaining control of the Senate , where the party has a 55-45 majority . But the outlook is n't as bright for Republicans in the House of Representatives . Democrats have a good chance of picking up the five seats they need to regain control because of a large number of Republican retirements . <p> " With Republicans forced to defend 21 open seats , compared to only six for the Democrats , the odds of the House tipping to the Democrats are enhanced , " says University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock . <p> Of course , the country 's mood and the political dynamics of Campaign 2000 can change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day . " A stock market crash , an oil embargo , American troops in combat or a deadly terrorist attack could upset the whole apple cart , " Republican media strategist Tom Edmonds says . <p> Edmonds also does n't rule out the possibility of an " October surprise , " such as Clinton brokering an Israeli-Syrian peace treaty , that could be used to boost Gore in a close race . <p> For now , though , Gore is betting that he can land in the Oval Office by harnessing the good feelings generated by the robust economy . <p> Presidential scholars agree it 's still the best political bet . " The economy has always been our most reliable predictor in presidential elections , " says Stephen Hess , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . <p> " Whatever the public is saying about Gore being stiff or not congenial , as the election gets closer , these issues are likely to fade , and people will say this is an amazing economy . They will find it hard to turn their backs on the party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Percentage who are satisfied with the way things are going in the United States : January 199329% January 199435% March 199530% March 199641% February 199750% February 199863% January 199970% Now69% <p> Source : USA TODAY , CNN , Gallup <p> Pleased with candidate choices <p> Percentage who say there is a candidate running this year who would make a good president : January 199240% May 199657% Now75% <p> USA TODAY CNN GALLUP POLL <p> An upbeat electorate <p> Here 's how Americans are feeling about the state of the USA at the start of election year 2000 <p> How would you rate economic conditions in the USA today ?
