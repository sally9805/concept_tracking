Shes battled breast cancer , career setbacks , and her fear of getting older . Now , in her new book , she talks about staying healthy , happy , and red-hot . // Our lunch was supposed to take place at a glitzy , celebrity-studded restaurant in Los Angeles . Then , at the last minute , Suzanne Somers called to ask if I would n't prefer a home-cooked meal , served on the patio of her Malibu beach home . Her house , which overlooks a long stretch of sand and water , is small by entertainmentbiz standards and decorated for comfort , with lots of bleached white cotton slipcovered couches and easy chairs . The change of setting says a lot : Suzanne Somers no longer needs a high-profile power scene . For her , there 's no place like home . Somers is still long-legged , fit , and enormously attractive , her trademark blond hair tumbling to her shoulders . But , as good as she looks , no one would mistake her for 30 . As she chats on her veranda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candid about life as a bombshell at middle age . " Well , if you still want to be the curviest , the prettiest woman in the room , chances are you 're going to be really unhappy at midlife , " she says with a laugh . " But you can be the most fabulous , most interesting woman in the room . That 's where the real sexiness clicks in . If you accept each passage and enjoy it , it feels great . " Her own past contains some bumpy passages . A quarter century ago , Somers was an international icon starring in the most popular TV show in America-Threes Company , with Joyce DeWitt and John Ritter . But when she was fired from the show in 1981 over a messy contract dispute , critics predicted she would sink into where-are-they-now obscurity . Her exit from the show , followed by a very public feud with both DeWitt and Ritter , resulted in a yearlong depression . She spent the next two and a half decades reinventing her life with surprising agility . First she launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year award in 1986 . Then there were the Thighmaster years , in which Somers took a simple endorsement for a home-exercise gizmo and spun it into an entire diet-and-fitness empire . Somers created " Somersize " -a series of books , tapes , and food products , which sell in the multimillions . She has also launched successful lines of jewelry and housewares on the Home Shopping Network . Now , at age 57 , she has a brand-new book , The Sexy Years , about making the most of midlife . In person , Somers projects warmth and self-confidence . Yet over the course of a four-hour lunch , another , more vulnerable woman seems to be skating just beneath the surface . " It used to be that every room I walked into , I felt like I should n't be taking up the space , " she acknowledges . " Now I 'm very emotionally healthy , and I 'm proud ofthat . But , yeah , there are lapses . " The third of four children , Somers was raised in the small town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league baseball player , who came home drunk and often beat his wife and children . " I was afraid of the night , because the night was always going to bring something terrible , " she says . " We had a lock installed in our upstairs closet , and my mother would round us up and say , " Hurry ! Let 's get in the closet . ' I 'd curl up in a little blanket on the floor , while my mom and sister and brother would sit on this cedar chest and lean against each other . And we 'd hear him downstairs , yelling " Where are you ! " It was like having a monster in the house . " It was not surprising , then , when Somers , at age 17 , got pregnant and married a local boy , Bruce Somers . Anything to get out of the house , she admits . The birth of her son seven months after her wedding day , and her subsequent divorce a couple of years later , shocked the sensibilities of her conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was divorced . I was such a scandal , " she says . The local whispering drove Somers to pack up her son and flee to Sausalito , where she says she tried to find work as a model and regularly thought of suicide . Her life reached a critical pass in 1970 , when her thenfive-year-old son , Bruce junior , rode his brand-new scooter into the street and was hit by a car . The little boy survived , " but when I took him home from the hospital , he 'd have these horrible nightmares , and nothing would help , " says Somers . Frantic for a solution , she brought her son to a local mental health center , where for two dollars a week , a therapist saw both mother and child . A year later , the therapist informed Somers that Bruce junior no longer needed therapy but that she ought to stay . " I said , " Why ? ! " She said , " You apologize for everything . You have the lowest self-esteem of anyone I 've ever met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of healing . " If the anger and pain of your childhood remains locked in your soul , " she says quietly , " it becomes the driving force of who you are . " Undoing that pain , says Somers , has meant writing her various memoirs , including the 1988 best-seller Keeping secrets , and speaking out about growing up in an alcoholic family . Somers says she now has a happiness that eluded her in her TV-star days . " I was so insecure and competitive , I was always looking behind me . But at my age now , the fears and the guilt and the worry that used to make me feel undeserving of anything good no longer factor in . " In The Sexy Years , Somers talks about learning to like herself , and the more difficult challenge of learning to like growing older . " It 's important to truly examine our patterns of behavior and our ability to grow and adapt to change , " she writes in her book . " Are you in the right frame of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did things in the past and look for ways to improve your life ? This is the best possible time to fulfill dreams or create new ones . " Still , she adds , " gravity does exist and some things are going to happen , no matter what you do . " Her antidote ? Girlfriends , who are more important now than ever . " It 's comforting to be able to share the startling effects of aging with a good friend , " she writes , " to be able to open up to someone without judgment . " Finally , Somers believes that aging involves a trade-off : " We may not be the youngest , hottest babes anymore , but what we 've lost in this area we have gained in wisdom and confidence . " And yet , when Somers entered her 50s , she was faced with a crisis that nearly robbed her of her hard-won self-esteem . When she first slammed into menopause seven years ago , " I felt like I 'd been mowed down by a truck , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense night sweats that fractured her sleep . " I 'd go to bed , then wake up 15 minutes later , soaking wet . So I 'd change into a dry nightshirt and leave the covers off , then wake up again freezing . This would happen all night long . " The loss " of sleep in turn affected her moods and her concentration , leaving her weepy for no reason . The final straw , according to Somers , was when her libido disappeared : The sex symbol had lost her sex drive . " I 've been with my husband producer Alan Hamel for 35 years , " she says , " and suddenly I could feel nothing . It really freaked me out . " Desperate , Somers turned to several gynecologists for help , but she says she felt their **28;245;TOOLONG hormone replacement therapy-were n't right for her . So she set out to do her own research . Finally , with the help of Dr. Diana Schwarzbein , an endocrinologist , Somers arrived at her own personal solution to the challenges of menopause : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact molecular match to the hormones the body loses in the aging process , " she explains . With her hormones once more in balance , Somers says the change was dramatic . Her sex drive , memory , and good humor returned . " It 's so great at this age that I can look at my husband and feel , you know , really frisky ! " Somers believes she 's on to something important . " I feel that someone needs to talk about how glorious aging can be , " she says . " But to experience it , you have to eat right , exercise , and get to the bottom of your in- ' dividual hormonal mystery . " In April 2000 , Somers encountered another challenge when she was diagnosed with breast cancer-then became the subject of controversy when she insisted on staying on her bioidentical hormones and declined chemotherapy . ( She had a lumpectomy and was treated with radiation . ) Somers is now in remission , but she says her bout with cancer and die sudden death last September of Threes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tearful reconciliation only a year before his death ) have deepened her commitment to live every day fully . " John was the most talented actor I 've ever met , " she " says . " As a physical comedian he was beyond Jim Carrey , beyond anyone . But I do n't think he ever got the chance to show that talent fully . Now that chance has gone forever . " As the sun dips into the Pacific Ocean , Somers ponders her own popularity , which , despite its peaks and valleys , has endured . " I think it 's because I offer hope , " she says . " With my background , 1 should n't be happy . I should n't have this success and this wonderful marriage with kids and grandkids . Sure , I have to work on my selfesteem all the time . But , " she adds , " I made it out . I want women to know they can have their own healthy , happy lives . I did it . So can you . " Sidebar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success and this wonderful marriage ...
