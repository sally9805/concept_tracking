<p> If last March is the measure , this is a very good time to play women 's basketball in the Pac-10 . <p> The conference that has been underrated , disregarded and disrespected finally succeeded when it counted last spring , putting five teams in the NCAA brackets and getting five first-round wins , earning national respect and setting the stage of a competitive follow-up in 2005-06 . <p> With the conference season starting Tuesday , it 's apparent that the Pac-10 is n't merely top-heavy , with teams such as five-time defending champ Stanford , Arizona State , USC and UCLA boasting experience and talent . The bottom is significantly better as well . <p> The four teams  --  Washington , Cal , Washington State and Oregon State  --  <p> that finished at the back end of the conference standings last season put up a combined 26-7 record in the preseason , making a competitive Pac-10 that much more so . <p> " Top to bottom , I think it 's going to be a grind every night , " Washington State coach Sherri Murrell said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a hard time thinking that somebody is going to run away with it . " <p> Stanford is still the favorite for the title , a habit that 's hard to break , particularly with the inside-outside combination of Brooke Smith and Candice Wiggins . <p> The likelihood that the Cardinal can run through the conference with a 17-1 dominance they had last season is diminished by the quality of the challengers . <p> Arizona State , USC and UCLA all have been ranked in the Top 25 and seem poised to disrupt the Cardinal 's string of five conference titles . <p> " I ca n't picture the top team having fewer than three losses , " said UCLA coach Kathy Olivier . " It 's going to be very tight . " <p> A team-by-team preview , in predicted order of finish : <p> Stanford <p> 2004-05 : 32-3 , 17-1 in Pac-10/1st <p> Coach : Tara VanDerveer , 20th season ( 487-122 ) <p> Pre-conference record : 5-2 <p> Notable results : Loss to No. 14 Minnesota ( 84-77 ) on road ; defeated No. 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 2 Tennessee ( 74-67 ) at home . <p> Outlook : The Cardinal , who have n't lost a Pac-10 home game since March 1 , 2001 , against USC , will have to play well on the road to defend their title . Losing Kristen Newlin , at least temporarily , to a thigh injury makes things tougher , but there 's evidence players such as freshmen Jillian Harmon and Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and sophomore Cissy Pierce are ready to assume prominent roles . Still , Stanford 's chances to win a sixth straight title rest on the talents of sophomore guard Candice Wiggins , the defending Pac-10 Player of the Year , and junior center Brooke Smith . <p> Arizona State <p> 2004-05 : 24-10 , 12-6/tie-2nd <p> Coach : Charli Turner Thorne , 10th season ( 155-123 ) <p> Pre-conference : 8-1 <p> Notable results : Defeated No. 21 Vanderbilt ( 69-60 ) at home ; loss to No. 6 North Carolina ( 79-72 ) at tournament ; defeated No. 18 New Mexico ( 73-61 ) at home . <p> Outlook : Talented , experienced and confident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school history coming off March 's run to the Sweet 16 . ASU is deep in the frontcourt with All-Pac-10 Emily Westerberg , Aubree Johnson , Kristen Kovesdy and Amy Denson . And this is the best perimeter shooting team Turner Thorne has coached , led by dynamic guard Jill Noe , back after two years off with knee injuries . ASU already has wins over Vanderbilt and New Mexico and is tough to beat at home . <p> UCLA <p> 2004-05 : 16-12 , 10-8/6th <p> Coach : Kathy Olivier , 13th season ( 186-168 ) <p> Pre-conference : 5-4 <p> Notable results : Loss to No. 5 Baylor ( 93-85 ) on road ; defeated No. 17 Georgia ( 84-64 ) at home ; lost to No. 15 Oklahoma ( 83-78 ) on road . <p> Outlook : The Bruins are among the cream of the crop with one of the most talented groups of guards in the country , senior Nikki Blue and juniors Noelle Quinn and Lisa Willis . The three are combining to average 51.7 points a game . UCLA is the highest-scoring team in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also is allowing the league 's highest total . The Bruins , coming off a tough loss to UC Santa Barbara , need to stay healthy and get more consistent production inside , where Lindsey Plumier is the go-to player . <p> USC <p> 2004-05 : 20-11 , 12-6/tie-2nd <p> Coach : Mark Trakh , 2nd season ( 26-14 ) <p> Pre-conference : 6-3 <p> Notable results : Loss to No. 13 Notre Dame ( 73-62 ) on road ; loss to No. 4 Ohio State ( 68-57 ) at home . <p> Outlook : Trakh has the Women of Troy on the right track with a team-oriented approach ( five players average at least 7.7 points ) . Forward Meghan Gnekow is the only senior on the roster and junior guard Eshaya Murphy is the leading scorer at 15.6 . Trakh says he 's worried that his team still ca n't shoot the ball well , and USC still does n't have a win over a big-time team , losing to both ranked opponents it has played . <p> Oregon <p> 2004-05 : 21-10 , 12-6/tie-2nd <p> Coach : Bev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8-1 <p> Notable results : Loss to No. 25 Temple ( 51-46 ) at home . <p> Outlook : The Ducks are off to an 8-1 start this season , but the combined record of their defeated opponents is 19-44 . Oregon is moving on without Cathrine Kraayeveld and Andrea Bills , looking to players such as Carolyn Ganes , Gabrielle Richards and Chelsea Wagner as Smith puts an emphasis on rebounding and defense . The Ducks ' offense will be a shared affair ; all 12 players on the roster are averaging at least 12 minutes a game . <p> Washington <p> 2004-05 : 14-16 , 9-9/7th <p> Coach : June Daugherty , 10th season ( 161-117 ) <p> Pre-conference : 7-2 <p> Notable results : Defeated No. 22 Utah ( 63-56 ) at home ; loss to No. 5 Baylor ( 81-74 ) on road . <p> Outlook : This is the most experienced team June Daugherty has coached in the last few years , with three fifth-year seniors : guard Kayla Burt , forward Kristen O'Neill and guard Nicole Castro . The Huskies , led by junior guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeating Utah , Alabama , Florida State , Rice and Michigan and coming within seven points of defending NCAA champ Baylor in Waco . The Huskies are a dark-horse contender for one of the top spots in the Pac-10 . <p> Cal <p> 2004-05 : 11-18 , 4-14/8th <p> Coach : Joanne Boyle , 1st season <p> Pre-conference : 8-2 <p> Notable results : Loss to No. 18 New Mexico ( 55-46 ) on road ; and loss to No. 5 Baylor ( 75-58 ) at tournament . <p> Outlook : The Bears , riding a four-game winning streak headed into their opener at Washington , start three or four freshmen a game ( depending on the health of point guard Jene ' Morris ) and have an 8-2 preseason mark in a schedule intended to set them up for success . Cal 's top four scorers are freshmen , with forward/center Ashley Walker leading the way at 13.6 ppg . Forward Devanei Hampton has averaged 16.4 points in the last four games . The team 's only senior , forward Renee Wright , leads in rebounding at 7.9 per game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach : Joan Bonvicini , 15th season ( 262-164 ) <p> Pre-conference : 4-4 <p> Notable results : Loss to No. 22 Utah ( 66-63 ) at home ; and No. 8 Maryland ( 92-67 ) on road . <p> Outlook : This wo n't be an easy season for the Wildcats . They are dealing with the death of Shawntinice Polk emotionally and on the court . Arizona , which lost post Shannon Hobson for the season to a back injury , has precious little size in the post , which will make it tough to compete for a title . The Wildcats ' best hopes come in the backcourt with senior Natalie Jones , sophomore Ashley Whisonant and junior Joy Hollingsworth , playing her first season after transferring from USF . All three are averaging double-figures . <p> Washington State <p> 2004-05 : 6-22 , 2-16/9th <p> Coach : Sherri Murrell , 4th season ( 20-72 ) <p> Pre-conference : 6-2 <p> Notable result : Loss to No. 14 Minnesota ( 83-57 ) on road . <p> Outlook : The Cougars , off to their best start since 1996-97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by 6-2 junior Kate Benz , the Pac-10 rebounding leader ( 12.3 per game ) . Whether they can climb the ladder in the Pac-10 standings is another matter . Katie Appleton is one of four freshmen providing depth and hope for the future . Appleton leads the team in scoring at 11.6 points per game . Senior guard Charmaine Jones is next at 10.5 . <p> Oregon State <p> 2004-05 : 6-23 , 1-17/10th <p> Coach : LaVonda Wagner , 1st season <p> Pre-conference : 6-1 <p> Notable result : Loss to No. 22 Utah ( 62-53 ) on road . <p> Outlook : Wagner 's first season coaching in the Pac-10 is likely to be a bumpy one , even with a 6-1 start that is the program 's best since 2000-01 . The Beavers are going to play defense . They have held opponents to an average of 49.6 points per game . Oregon State has finished with a winning record in Pac-10 play only twice in the last nine seasons .
