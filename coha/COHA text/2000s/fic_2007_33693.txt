#2005 All days should be like this . All moments . Gerhard Shoutens hurtled down an expert ski run that paralleled a razorback ridge , following his friend Kristoph Maas . Sunlight drenched the snow-mantled Alps , and the wide sky was a vault of sapphire blue . Gerhard reveled in the soaring exhilaration of speeding through the crisp new powder . " Das ist Wahnsinn ! " he shouted into the wind . Kristoph whooped in agreement . " Super ! Toll ! " They flashed through a hushed stand of pines and into an open area , their velocity increasing , their skis hissing as the trail took them along the winding rim of a couloir . On one side spread a slope of pristine snow . Gerhard glanced down the other -- a spectacular gorge so deep that house-size boulders at the bottom appeared to be mere pebbles . It was breathtaking . " Sieh dir das mal an ! " he yelled . But before his friend could admire the view , his entire body seemed to recoil as if he had struck some obstacle hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skis lifted off the track , and he was airborne . Gerhard leaned low into his skis , frantically trying to reach him . But Kristoph shot off the edge and into the void . Two days later AllenwoodFederal Correctional Complex Allenwood , Pennsylvania At 6:40 a.m. , ten minutes past morning call at the crowded federal penitentiary in the Susquehanna Valley , a stranger in civilian clothes marched down a gray cellblock , staring straight ahead . A Bureau of Prisons lieutenant led ; two guards followed . All looked uneasy . The man paused at a cell . As soon as the door opened , he moved inside and glared down at the solitary cot . The blanket had been yanked aside to reveal blue prison trousers and shirt stuffed with crumpled newspapers and arranged to mimic a man lying on his side . There was also a fake wood arm covered with flesh-colored upholstery from the prison factory . With the pillow pounded high as if it covered a head , and the blanket on top exposing part of the arm , not even the obligatory flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one slept there . " Clever bastard . " The stranger jerked a cell phone from his pocket . He punched in a number and kept his voice low : " He 's gone , all right . I 'm in his cell now . I'll --  " " Seal it off , " the voice on the other end of the line ordered . " No one 's to search it , understand ? And for God 's sake , make sure no one tells the press that Jay Tice has escaped ! " Langley , Virginia At 9:06 a.m . Laurence Litchfield , the CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations -- the DDO -- hand-carried a sealed white envelope down from the seventh floor to the Staff Operations Center , the SOC , which was responsible for case-management support to colleagues in the field . In his mid-forties , Litchfield was lean , with a runner 's wiry body and a lanky gait . His eyes were carved deep into his face . Above them , wide brows formed an ink-black line across his forehead . The SOC chief looked up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got some overnight requests from our people in Yemen and Qatar . I was going to memo you about our progress with the intelligence summit , but I can fill you in now . " " First I need to talk to one of your people -- Elaine Cunningham . " She noted the envelope in his hand . " Cunningham ? You know she 's sidelined . " " I know . Show me where she is . " She nodded and led him out the door and down two long corridors and into a room crammed with gray modular cubicles , which someone long ago had cynically dubbed the Parking Lot . Here a glacially changing landscape of some three dozen field officers waited like used cars collecting dust , futures uncertain . Their covers had been irrevocably blown , or they had proved inept , or they had run into Langley politics . For many , the next stop was the tedium of personnel or recruitment or curriculum -- or , worst case , dismissal . The chief pointed out Cunningham 's cubicle among the maze , and Litchfield thanked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet you there . " She left , and he turned down the narrow aisle and found Elaine Cunningham in her cramped enclosure , marching back and forth beside her desk , arms crossed , her shoulder propping her phone against her ear as she talked quietly into it . She was a small woman , twenty-nine years old and blond , dressed in an unbuttoned black jacket , white T-shirt , and belted black pants . As he leaned against the frame of her cubicle to study her , she glanced up and recognized him . She winked one large blue eye in greeting . And continued talking into the phone : " So , your missing source is a broker in Brussels . He 's a morose Dane , unmarried , follows soccer . He did n't show up for a blind date yesterday and missed the alternate meet this morning . Now you have word he 's in the wind , and Copenhagen ca n't find him . " She pursed her lips . Her pace quickened . " All Scandinavians tend to be stereotyped as morose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedes who are mostly angst-ridden , while the Danes are more happy-go-lucky . So your morose Dane may actually be Swedish , and if he 's driving home , he probably did n't stop in Copenhagen but took the Oresund Fixed Link across the sound into Malm . When amateurs change identities , they usually create legends based on what they already know . If he 's Swedish -- especially if he comes from the Malm area -- it 's possible he knows Copenhagen well enough to fake it as his hometown , and if he does , it 's a good bet he speaks Danish like a native . " Cunningham paused , listening . " My pleasure . No , this is the end of the Langley road for me . Hey , it 's been great working with you , too . You always give me interesting questions . " As she hung up , she grabbed the single sheet of paper in her printer tray . " Morning , Mr. Litchfield . This is my lucky day . Who would 've thought I 'd get to resign to the DDO himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . " Litchfield was unsurprised . " You 'll make your psychologist happy . " He took the letter , folded it into his pocket , and sat in the only side chair . " That 's what I 'm all about -- making CIA clinicians happy . " Her smile did not involve her eyes . " I suspect you do n't really want to quit . People who excel seldom do . " As Litchfield continued to watch , she blinked then sank into her desk chair . Dressed in her simple black and white clothes , her hair smoothed back into a ponytail at the nape of her neck , and wearing little makeup , she could pass as a cop or the leader of a gang of thieves . This flexibility of affect would be easier for her than for some , because she was neither beautiful nor ugly . Still , she was pretty enough that she could use her looks : Her face was slender , her cheekbones good , her classic features slightly irregular , and her golden hair shone . Litchfield had studied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was perfect . " What you say has a certain truth to it , " she acknowledged . " But I 've also heard it said that a rut is just like a grave -- only longer . I 'm in a rut . I 'm not doing Langley any good , and I 'm not doing myself any good . It 's time to get on with my life , such as it is . " She gazed at the white envelope in his hand then peered up at him curiously . " But I think you have something else in mind . " He inclined his head . " I have a job tailored to your talents . . . and to your limitations . To do it , you 'll be in the field alone , which you seem to prefer anyway . " " Not necessarily . It 's just that the bodies Langley kept sending to partner with me turned out to be less than stellar . " " You do n't trust anyone , do you ? " " My mother . I 'm fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lives far away , in California . " " You trusted your husband , too . But he 's dead . Afghanistan , right ? " For a moment she appeared speechless . She seemed to shrink , grow calcified , as hard as a tombstone . He pushed her again : " You 've had a problem working with people since he died . Your psychologist has recommended Langley let you go . " Instead of exploding , she nodded . Her expression was grim . " You were one of our best hunters , " Litchfield said . " Right now I need the best . " As a hunter , her specialty was locating missing spies , assets gone to ground , " lost " foreign agents , anyone in the covert world of interest to Langley who had vanished -- and doing it in such a way that the public never knew . He watched a reflective look cross her face . It was time to change the subject : " Why do you think you were so successful ? " " Probably because I simply have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep myself in the psychology of my target until the physical evidence and clues take on new meaning . That 's all there is to it . " For the first time , he smiled . " No , there 's far more than that . " She was modest , and she had not lost her temper . All things considered , she was clearly his best choice . Eyeing him speculatively , she said , " When the DDO comes to call , I figure something important has happened . And when I 'm on the verge of being fired and he still comes to call , I figure it could be crucial . So let me help you out -- if you think I can do the job , tell me what it is , and I 'll tell you whether I can or want to take it on . " He looked around . " Not here . The assignment is with one of our special units . And it 's M-classified . " " M " indicated an extraordinarily sensitive covert operation . Among the highest the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so secret it could be referred to only by initials . Her blue eyes snapped with excitement . It had been a long time since she 'd had such an opportunity . " Give me back my resignation letter . As long as I do n't have to mommy fools , I 'll deliver . " He handed it to her along with his envelope . " Here 's the address and the name of your contact , plus my phone number . It 's the usual protocol -- you hunt , our regular people capture . Read , memorize , then shred everything , including my number . Good luck . " The Catoctin Mountains , Maryland Dense forests flowed dark and primeval down the ridged sides of the Maryland mountains to where a roadside stop had been built on a green basin of land off busy Highway 15 . A cool breeze typical of the early hour at this time of year blew around the two-pump gas station and parking lot and caf . Jay Tice stood utterly still in shadows . His bloody clothes announced he should be considered dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps even more sinister : It was in his aging face , where intelligence and violence warred just beneath the skin . His hair was short , the color of iron shavings . Two crevices curved down from either side of his nose to his mouth . His chin was as firm as ever , marked by the dramatic cleft . He moved off through the trees . At the rear of the caf , he dropped to his haunches . There were four windows on the back wall -- one was opaque glass , two displayed customers eating , and the fourth , next to the doorway , showed a desk and file cabinets . That was the office , just where he remembered . The back door was open . From it drifted the greasy odors of fried sausage and bacon . Tice looked around then sprinted to the doorway . He peered cautiously inside . " Two eggs , easy ! " A voice yelled from the end of the cluttered hall . " Half stack ! " Within seconds he slipped unnoticed into the office . He locked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , opened the window . From somewhere inside the caf , a newscast described a terrorist bombing by a group thought to be connected to al-Qaeda . He sat down at the computer and created a new Yahoo ! e-mail account from which he opened a blank e-mail , addressed it , and typed into the message window : Dog 's run away . Call home . As soon as he hit send , he addressed another e-mail with a different message : Unexpected storm forced evacuation . In touch soon . Deleting all copies saved to the computer , he turned it off . He slid out the window , stifling a groan as his hip grazed the lip , furious that he was not as agile as he once was . He closed the window and seconds later was in the forest again , moving swiftly away .
