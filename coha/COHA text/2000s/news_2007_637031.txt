<p> Dog shows are the beauty pageants of the dog world . And the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show , which gets under way today , is the Miss America Pageant of those dog shows . <p> But the judges at these beauty contests do n't care what new tricks the dogs know or what their position is on doggie day care etiquette . What they care about is looks  --  and they 're looking for a lot more than just 36-24-36 . <p> For instance , the standard for a basset hound is more than a page long . Here 's what it says for the head : " The head is large and well proportioned . Its length from occiput to muzzle is greater than the width at the brow . In overall appearance the head is of medium width . The skull is well domed , showing a pronounced occipital protuberance . A broad flat skull is a fault . " <p> And that 's just the first 47 words . It goes on for another 288 . On just the head . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the body , the hindquarters , the tail , the size , the gait , the coat , the color and disqualifying traits . <p> And that 's just for bassets . Each of the 165 breeds and varieties approved by the American Kennel Club has its own standards , set by the breed parent club , which can vary from a few paragraphs to several pages . <p> " The standard is considered the bible for dog judges , " said Jean Fournier of Calhoun , who is judging the working group tonight . <p> Dog shows start by judging the individual breeds . The winner of each breed then moves into one of seven groups  --  working , herding , sporting , nonsporting , toy , terrier or hound  --  and the seven winners of those groups compete for the grand prize  --  best in show . <p> Most dog judges are qualified to do only a few breeds . It takes years of judging and study to get to a level like Fournier , who is qualified to judge all of the groups except terriers and hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show judge , like the one at Westminster this year , Dr. Robert Indeglia , a heart surgeon from Narragansett , R.I. <p> " When you 've been a judge as long as I have 35 years , you do a lot more with your eye than your hands , " said Indeglia , explaining what a judge looks for . <p> But all the judges touch the dogs , he said . They check teeth or bite , feel the shoulder structure and chest , the texture of the coat , and , on long-haired dogs where problems can be covered up with well-placed grooming , they 'll especially check body structure , Indeglia said . Then there 's the hand slipped between the back legs on male dogs . Yes , they have to check . <p> " Because dog shows are about promoting better breeding stock , all male dogs must have two normally descended testicles , " Indeglia said . " It 's a disqualification if they do n't . " <p> Then they check the dog 's movement . That 's why they ask the handlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There 's a certain way each dog is supposed to move when going away from you and when coming towards you , " said Kathleen Steen , an Alpharetta dog woman who has judged at Westminster and the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship among numerous other shows . " And when the dogs are going around the ring , you check their side gait . " <p> Steen said they are checking to see if the dogs could do the job they were originally bred to do , such as herding livestock or hunting birds . <p> But most of these dogs are more likely to see a blow dryer than a sheep or a quail . And the top winning dogs often have extensive publicity machines and enough frequent flier miles to spend the summer in Europe . <p> Dog shows at the highest levels have become big-money events , with wealthy backers footing the bill to ship dogs , along with their professional handlers , to shows all over the country . Then there are the photo spreads taken by professional photographers that show up in the leading dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and it 's no different in dog shows , " Fournier said . <p> Fournier said professional handlers look for good dogs , then match them up with wealthy backers who , for the cost of footing the show expenses , get to say they " co-own " one of the top dogs in the country . <p> " It 's a very costly thing to show a dog like that , " Steen said of the constant travel and other expenses to take dogs to shows almost every weekend . " That 's why they need backers . It can easily cost $200,000 in a year to campaign a dog . " <p> James Moses of Carrollton , who breeds and shows German shepherds , last year was pushing Geneva , 4 , a dog he bred . Janet Lange , who lives outside St. Louis , signed on as a co-owner , and Geneva finished as the No. 1 German shepherd and the No. 2 herding dog in the nation in 2006 . <p> So what did it cost to secure those positions ? " Just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about $30,000 a month , " Lange said . " But that does n't include the advertising costs . Advertising keeps a dog in the judges ' minds . " <p> But it 's still possible to do well with a dog on less . Eddie Keith and his wife , Lynn Regnery , of Wilmington , N.C. , own Cruiser , the No. 3 pug in the nation . Cruiser was bred and is handled by Linda Rowell of Dublin . <p> " We 're not wealthy people , we 're on a budget , so she 's only been shown about half as many weekends as other top dogs , " Keith said of the campaign . " We 're only spending about $1,000 a month . " <p> Still , it was good enough to get them a spot at the Westminster dog show , a first for the couple . <p> " We were n't going to go because of the expense , but then my wife gave me the trip for Christmas as a surprise , " Keith said . " We 're just ecstatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our girl on . " <p> All the judges who have worked at Westminster agree that picking a winner from the cream of the crop is hard . Indeglia said in the end , it really is just one person 's choice of which dog he thinks is the best one out there that day . He knows how he 'll pick the best in show winner Tuesday night . <p> " In the end , it 's going to be the dog I like the best , " Indeglia said . " . . . If they said I could take one of the seven home , it will be the dog that would leave with me .
