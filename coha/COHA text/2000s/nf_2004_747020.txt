Pictorialism began in the last two decades of the nineteenth century and was known by that name until about 1920 . A new name , Camerawork , attributed to Alfred Steiglitz , was used early in the twentieth century . New Vision and other names appeared in Germany and elsewhere at about the same time . Today it is the International Exhibition of Photography . More important than the name is the fact that exhibitions have been around for a long time  --  more than 110 years . They were not all international in scope , but most accepted entries from other countries . <p> The Photographic News for May 12 , 1893 , published in Great Britain , lists the exhibitors and entries for several of the exhibitions in 1893 . Some of those listed include the Birmingham and the Forfarshire Exhibitions in England and the Sixth Exhibition of The Photographic Society of Philadelphia in the United States . The latter listing suggests that exhibitions were held , at least , since 1888 . The exhibitors in the Photographic Society of Philadelphia exhibition were mostly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well represented . <p> The May 30 , 1890 issue of The Photographic News announced The Liverpool Photographic Exhibition will open at the Walker Art Gallery in March 1891 . It was sponsored by the Liverpool Amateur Photographic Society and ran four weeks . It should be mentioned that there were no standards for exhibitions at that time and each sponsor listed the rules under which that exhibition would operate . <p> The First Birkenhead International was held in 1900 . It continued until 1914 when it was interrupted by WW I. It resumed in 1920 and continued until 1938 when it was interrupted by WW II . The exhibition resumed continuous operation in 1947 . <p> Some of the rules of the times included classes , subject matter , print sizes , number of entries , who could enter , criteria for evaluation , number of acceptances , where exhibited , date and duration of the exhibition and conditions for public visitation . In a sense , the survival and success of photo exhibitions seems more a miracle than an accomplishment . Exhibitions have been sponsored by photo organizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have been open to the public free of charge . <p> In the early exhibitions studied and reported here , pictures were entered in two media : prints and lantern slides . Also , they could be entered in many classes , including local amateur , amateur portrait , landscape , clouds , professional portraiture , professional genre , children studies , ladies class and champion class . In the 1893 Forfarshire Exhibition , gold , silver and bronze medals were awarded in eleven classes . <p> Over the next two decades , exhibitions increased in number and prospered despite failure to adopt standards , or even rules , for their goals and conduct . New exhibitions were announced over the years and attracted more and more exhibitors . Some of the new exhibitions failed to show the prints , or even go through the judging process . Entries were not returned to the makers and it appears there was no intent to return them , but rather sell them . By 1924 there were 44 open exhibitions listed . The number increased to 83 by 1934 . <p> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the 1930s . Most were local in nature and were conducted in a manner similar to those conducted by the Photographic Society of Great Britain . In 1935 , PSA sponsored the First International Exhibition of Foreign Camera Work Creations that included 162 prints from 33 countries . In 1936 , 100 prints were collected for an exhibition titled Salon of 1937 . Entries were limited to North American photographers , but included PSA members residing in foreign countries . Prints exhibited previously were not accepted in this exhibition . The First International Exhibit of Scientific and Applied Photography was held in March and April of 1937 . Eight-hundred prints were hung in the Rochester Public Library , Rochester , New York . It was sponsored by the Rochester Technical Section of PSA , a section of the PSA Technical Division , which later became the Techniques Division . <p> There are some suggestions that color exhibitions may have been held as early as 1907 with the then new autochrome . Some have even suggested that there may have been color exhibitions earlier when Clerk Maxwell described a process for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to give these mentions credence . <p> The first annual ' color show ' was held in 1938 by the Chicago Area Camera Club Association . The first Color Exhibition in North America was held in 1939 as a section of the Rochester International . These were recognized and popular until 1943 when the PSA Color Division held the first all color slide exhibition , advertised as The First International American Slide Salon . Ten slides per entrant were permitted and 3033 slides were received from 300 exhibitors . <p> In 1933 , PSA adopted the Who 's Who listing . Each exhibitor had to enter a minimum of 10 exhibitions each year to be listed in the Who 's Who list for that year . A review of the affect of this procedure was favorable and spawned the Pictorial Division 's Award of Merit program , which developed into the Star Ratings System . International Exhibitions owe much of their success to the adoption of Who 's Who listings , creation of the Star Ratings System and their acceptance by exhibitors . There is no doubt the published recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a coveted reward for their effort and expenses . <p> The Who 's Who idea was not original with PSA , but was used for years by the magazine American Photography . The editor , Frank Fraprie ( see footnote ) was a famous photographer and was interested in ratings of photographic exhibitions . His Who 's Who in Pictorial Photography , covering black and white exhibitions , was published each year in the American Annual , listing exhibitors and their proficiency ratings in the salons . <p> The Award of Merit was approved by the PSA Board of Directors in 1946 and the first such awards would be announced in 1947 . Awards would be as follows : star 25 acceptances with 6 prints star 80 acceptances with 16 prints star 160 acceptances with 32 prints star 320 acceptances with 64 prints <p> The Award program was a great incentive for participation in the exhibitions . Soon many exhibitors had reached the highest plateau of 4 stars and the program had to be expanded to indicate the higher levels of proficiency . The fifth star was added and higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond star , photo naturalist , master photographer , photo traveler and master photojournalist . <p> Because of the variance in operation of the salons , PSA established exhibition standards and criteria for acceptable salon operation . Salons meeting these standards were considered PSA-sanctioned salons and acceptances in such salons would qualify toward the Award of Merit , or stars . <p> The salons had operation problems and it was felt the Pictorial Division ( now Pictorial Print Division ) should establish a set of standardized , recommended practices . A meeting was held at the Engineers Club in Philadelphia where the recommended practices were drawn . Included on the committee were John P. Mudd , Pictorial Division Chairman , John Rowan , Corresponding Secretary and Charles Heller , long-time treasurer of the Society . <p> When the Color Division ( now Color Slide Division ) collected thousands of entries for the 1943 Color Exhibition , they asked that the Who 's Who in Color listing be published in the PSA Journal in the same manner Frank Fraprie published for the print salons . The listing was first published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask that their Who 's Who in Nature for 1945 listing be published in the PSA Journal . The Who 's Who in Nature for 1945 was published in the October 1946 issue , listing both prints and slides . <p> Because the Who 's Who in Pictorial Photography was still being published by a different organization , the Camera Club Committee chairman suggested at the 1949 PSA Board meeting that " The Pictorial Division should duplicate on a large scale what the Color Division and the Nature Division now do in the listing of exhibition records . " The suggestion was taken seriously and was approved . The first PSA listing of Who 's Who in Pictorial Photography appeared in the November 1950 issue of the PSA Journal . <p> There were some stereo exhibits as part of the Color Slide exhibitions in 1950 , 1951 and 1952 . The PSA Stereo Division was created in 1952 and stereo activity was on the increase . The first Who 's Who in Stereo was published in the May 1953 PSA Journal . Later additions to the Who 's Who listings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's Who in Motion Pictures in 1961 , Who 's Who in Photojournalism in 1970 and Who 's Who in Photo Travel in 1975 . <p> In the beginning , the Who 's Who listings for the different divisions were published in different issues of the Journal . In 1953 , the Who 's Who listings for all divisions were published in the May issue . The May issue became the Who 's Who issue of the PSA Journal from that date . <p> There was a significant increase in the number of exhibitions and the number of divisions represented over the years . However , the number of print exhibitions dropped as other division exhibitions were added . In 1950 there were 101 print exhibitions worldwide and 38 were in North America . By 1970 there were only 87 print exhibitions worldwide , with 36 of them operating in North America . By 1990 there were only 59 print exhibitions worldwide . <p> There were 35 large mono print exhibitions in 2002 , some of which were circuits , resulting in 48 being judged . Only 13 were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current print exhibitions is not very clear . Most catalogs list number entered and we wonder if it means exhibitors or prints . I will assume the number describes exhibitors . The current list of exhibitions shows from 172 to 1500 exhibitors . Also , some exhibitions list more than one print class and give only one number entered figure . The Austrian Super Circuit exhibition lists 1,500 entered . The Detroit exhibition lists 171 entered for two print classes . <p> There were 132 color slide exhibitions in 2002 . Only 18 were in North America . The largest color slide exhibition is the Austrian Super Circuit , with about 40,000 pieces of photography submitted into color slides , nature slides , travel slides and color/mono prints divisions . The largest North American exhibition is the Greater Lynn ( Massachusetts ) , with about 850 exhibitors participating . The 2002 PSA exhibition had 283 entrants in the open section and 60 in various creative sections . <p> Our thanks to Wade Clutton , FPSA , for the information on current color slide exhibitions , and Jim Turnbull , Hon. PSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each will be glad to answer questions regarding their area of responsibility or to help you obtain entry forms or get started in the international exhibitions . <p> If you have never entered the international exhibitions , most of the foregoing is new to you . Also , you will have missed some of the greatest pleasures  --  and possible honors  --  in your pursuit of photography . If you are an exhibitor , you may have learned a few things you did n't know about the early days of pictorial print exhibitions . For those wishing to enter the exhibitions for the first time , you can obtain information by contacting the person listed for each division in the Exhibitions section in each issue of the PSA Journal on pages 46-49 . I can assure you that participation is simple and , most importantly , you will be well rewarded for your effort . <p> Footnote : Frank Fraprie , Hon.
