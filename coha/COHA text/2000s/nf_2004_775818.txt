Enemy of the State // " Anne Hutchinson is present , " a male voice announced from somewhere in the crowded meetinghouse , momentarily quieting the din that filled its cavernous hall . The meetinghouse of Cambridge , Massachusetts , a square structure of timber and clay with a thatched roof , served as the community 's city hall , church , and courthouse  --  the latter its role this chilly Tuesday in November 1637 . Hearing the news that the defendant had arrived , scores of bearded heads in black felt hats turned to find the one woman in the crowd . // There was nothing auspicious about Anne Hutchinson 's appearance as she stood in the doorway alongside several male relatives and supporters , awaiting the start of her trial . She was forty-six years old , of average height and bearing , with an unremarkable face . Her petticoat fell almost to the ground , revealing only the tips of her leather boots . Against the cold she wore a wool mantua , or cloak . A white coif covered her hair , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white linen smock and neckerchief , she wore all black . She was a stranger to no one present , having ministered as midwife and nurse to many of their wives and children . All knew her to be an active member of the church of Boston , the wife of the wealthy textile merchant William Hutchinson , the mother of twelve living children , and the grandmother of one , a five-day-old boy who just that Sunday had been baptized . There was , in short , no outer sign to suggest she was an enemy of the state . // Enemy she was , though , indeed the greatest threat Massachusetts had ever known . More than a few men in the room , including several of the ministers , considered her a witch . Others believed the Devil had taken over her soul . The governor , John Winthrop , who was waiting in an antechamber of the meetinghouse to begin the trial over which he would preside , suspected her of using her devilish powers to subjugate men by establishing " the community of women " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest crime , and the source of her power , was the series of weekly public meetings she held at her house to discuss Scripture and theology . At first , in 1635 , the evening meetings had been just for women , who then were generally encouraged to gather in small groups to gossip and offer mutual support . Soon scores of women , enchanted by her intelligence and magnetism , flocked to hear her analysis of the week 's Scripture reading , which many of them preferred to the ministers ' latest interpretation . " Being a woman very helpful in times of childbirth and other occasions of bodily infirmities , Hutchinson easily insinuated herself into the affections of many , " an official observed . Her " pretense was to repeat the ministers ' sermons , " the governor added , " but when that was done , she would comment upon the doctrines , interpret passages at her pleasure , and expound dark places of Scripture , and make it serve her turn , " going beyond " wholesome truths " to " set forth her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that her " custom was for her scholars to propound questions and she ( gravely sitting in the chair ) did make answers thereunto . " This was especially grievous in a time when the single chair in every house was for the use of the man alone . // Men had begun to accompany their wives to Hutchinson 's meetings in 1636 , and as her audiences swelled she offered a second session of religious instruction each week , just as the colonial ministers liked to give a Thursday lecture as well as their Sunday sermon . The Reverend Weld lamented that members of her audience , " being tainted , conveyed the infection to others , " including " some of the magistrates , some gentlemen , some scholars and men of learning , some burgesses of our General Court , some of our captains and soldiers , some chief men in towns , and some eminent for religion , parts , and wit . " Anne Hutchinson had " stepped out of her place , " in the succinct phrase of the Reverend Hugh Peter , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife ; and a preacher than a hearer ; and a magistrate than a subject . " // It was painfully clear to Governor Winthrop , who had an excellent view of her comings and goings from his house directly across the road from hers in Boston , that Anne Hutchinson possessed the strongest constituency of any leader in the colony . She was , he confided in his journal , " a woman of a haughty and fierce carriage , a nimble wit and an active spirit , and a very voluble tongue . " Her name was absent ( on account of her sex ) from every offensive political act and document , he observed , but she was behind them all . " More bold than a man , " she was Virgil 's dux foemina facti , " the woman leading all the action "  --  the breeder and nourisher of all the county 's distempers , the sower of political and religious discord . Before Mistress Hutchinson had arrived in America , in the fall of 1634 , all was sweetness and light , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos . // Through a side door of the meetinghouse , the forty magistrates of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts filed into the dimly lit room . This court of no appeal , the only court available to the fledgling colony 's roughly seven thousand settlers , comprised the governor , a deputy governor , seven of their assistants ( chosen by the freemen to serve as the colony 's board of directors ) , and thirty-one deputies , prominent freemen chosen by the colony 's fourteen towns ( forerunners to the state 's legislators ) . The judges that day included the assistant Simon Bradstreet , of Cambridge , thirty-three , who as colonial secretary was expected to take notes ; Salem 's John Endicott , the righteous , forty-nine-year-old former soldier who had recently tried to pass a law forcing all women to wear veils , as in the Old Testament ; and Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley , who at sixty-one was the oldest judge . // Eight ministers in black robes also joined the procession , not to judge the defendant but to give testimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
