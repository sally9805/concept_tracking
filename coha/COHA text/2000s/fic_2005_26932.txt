From where Bill Buchanan sat with his back resting against the rough breccia , he could see the side of Whiteside 's head , about three feet away . When John leaned back , Buchanan could see the snowcapped top of Mount Taylor looming over Grants , New Mexico , about eighty miles to the east . Now John was leaning forward , talking . " This climbing down to climb back up , and climbing up so you can climb back down again , " Whiteside said . " That seems like a poor way to get the job done . Maybe it 's the only way to get to the summit , but I 'll bet we could find a faster way down . " " Relax , " Buchanan said . " Be calm . We 're supposed to be resting . " They were perched on one of the few relatively flat outcrops of basalt in what climbers of Ship Rock call Rappel Gully . On the way up , it was the launching point for the final hard climb to the summit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a desktop and 1,721 feet above the prairie below . If you were going down , it was where you began a shorter but even harder almost vertical climb to reach the slope that led you downward with a fair chance of not killing yourself . Buchanan , Whiteside , and Jim Stapp had just been to the summit . They had opened the army surplus ammo box that held the Ship Rock climbers ' register and signed it , certifying their conquest of one of North America 's hard ones . Buchanan was tired . He was thinking that he was getting too old for this . Whiteside was removing his climbing harness , laying aside the nylon belt and the assortment of pitons , jumars , etriers , and carabiners that make reaching such mountaintops possible . He did a deep knee bend , touched his toes , and stretched . Buchanan watched , uneasy . " What are you doing ? " " Nothing , " Whiteside said . " Actually , I 'm following the instructions of that rock climber 's guide you 're always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonessential weight before making an unprotected traverse . " Buchanan sat up . He played in a poker game in which Whiteside was called " Two-Dollar John " because of his unshakable faith that the dealer would give him the fifth heart if he needed one . Whiteside enjoyed taking risks . " Traversing what ? " Buchanan asked . " I 'm just going to ease over there and take a look . " He pointed along the face of the cliff . " Get out there maybe a hundred feet and you can see down under the overhang and into the honeycomb formations . I ca n't believe there 's not some way to rappel right on down . " " You 're looking for some way to kill yourself , " Buchanan said . " If you 're in such a damn hurry to get down , get yourself a parachute . " " Rappelling down is easier than up , " Whiteside said . He pointed across the little basin to where Stapp was preparing to begin hauling himself up the basalt wall behind them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began moving with gingerly care out onto the cliff face . Buchanan was on his feet . " Come on , John ! That 's too damn risky . " " Not really , " Whiteside said . " I 'm just going out far enough to see past the overhang . Just a peek at what it looks like . Is it all this broken-up breccia or is there , maybe , a big old finger of basalt sticking up that we could scramble right on down ? " Buchanan slid along the wall , getting closer , admiring Whiteside 's technique if not his judgment . The man was moving slowly along the cliff , body almost perfectly vertical , his toes holding his weight on perhaps an inch of sloping stone , his fingers finding the cracks , crevices , and rough spots that would help him keep his balance if the wind gusted . He was doing the traverse perfectly . Beautiful to watch . Even the body was perfect for the purpose . A little smaller and slimmer than Buchanan 's . Just bone , sinew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving like an insect against the cracked basalt wall . And a thousand feet below him  --  no , a quarter of a mile below him lay what Stapp liked to call " the surface of the world . " Buchanan looked out at it.Almost directly below , two Navajos on horseback were riding along the base of the monolith  --  tiny figures that put the risk of what Whiteside was doing into terrifying perspective.If he slipped , Whiteside would die , but not for a while.It would take time for a body to drop six hundred feet , then to bounce from an outcrop , and fall again , and bounce and fall , until it finally rested among the boulders at the bottom of this strange old volcanic core . Buchanan looked away from the riders and from the thought . It was early afternoon , but the autumn sun was far to the north and the shadow of Ship Rock already stretched southeastward for miles across the tan prairie . Winter would soon end the climbing season . The sun was already so low that it reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to the north early snows had already packed the higher peaks in Colorado 's San Juans . Not a cloud anywhere . The sky was a deep dry-country blue ; the air was cool and , a rarity at this altitude , utterly still . The silence was so absolute that Buchanan could hear the faint sibilance of Whiteside 's soft rubber shoe sole as he shifted a foot along the stone . A couple of hundred feet below him , a red-tailed hawk drifted along , riding an updraft of air along the cliff face . From behind him came the click of Stapp fastening his rappelling gear . This is why I climb , Buchanan thought . To get so far away from Stapp 's " surface of the earth " that I ca n't even hear it . But Whiteside climbs for the thrill of challenging death . And now he 's out about thirty yards . It 's just too damn risky . " That 's far enough , John , " Buchanan said . " Do n't press your luck . " " Two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I can take a look . " He moved . And stopped . And looked down . " There 's more of that honeycomb breccia under the overhang , " he said , and shifted his weight to allow a better head position . " Lot of those little erosion cavities , and it looks like some pretty good cracking where you can see the basalt . " He shifted again . " And a pretty good shelf down about  --  " Silence . Then Whiteside said , " I think I see a helmet . " " What ? " " My God ! " Whiteside said . " There 's a skull in it . " Continues ...
