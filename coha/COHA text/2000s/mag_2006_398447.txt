Section : Special Report In a secret , high-tech spy hub near Washington , the war on terror is 24-7 <p> Every weekday at 8 a.m. , Kevin Brock hefts a thick white ring binder onto a sleek , oval conference table . Labeled " Read Book , " the deceptively plain folder houses the " Threat Matrix , " a top-secret compendium of the most troubling reports of possible terrorist activity , drawn from the nation 's 16 intelligence agencies . It is thicker than usual on a recent Monday morning , packed with 66 separate items that came in over the weekend . Brock , the principal deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center , is about to brief some of the government 's most senior officials on the latest threat information . <p> First , though , he must sort through the reports , most of which are vague-and sometimes little more than anonymous tips . Many are false alarms . ( " If we could eliminate all the jilted lovers and ex-spouses , " Brock says later , cracking a smile , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daily basis . " ) But some of the nuggets-coming from CIA operatives , FBI sources , or reliable foreign spy agencies-must be taken seriously . Brock , after meeting with the leadership of the counterterrorism center , decided to present 18 of the threat reports at the 8 a.m. videoconference . <p> Facing a wall of secure video feeds , Brock watches top leaders from a dozen key players gather-the CIA , the FBI , the eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency , even the White House . A briefer from the center , running through the 18 items , discusses possible terrorist action in south Asia , Southeast Asia , the Middle East , even inside the United States . Brock raises the recent release of a videotape showing two of the September 11 hijackers smiling for the camera . He pays particular attention to overseas threats that have a possible domestic angle . " NCTC was created to . ensure the handshake occurs between international intelligence collection and the FBI or others within the country to take action , " says Brock , a career FBI agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a daily basis . " <p> " No boundaries . " Housed in an unmarked office complex in Northern Virginia , the National Counterterrorism Center has become the centerpiece of reform efforts to integrate the far-flung intelligence community . The NCTC was created in the wake of the September 11 attacks to reduce the gulf between America 's spy agencies and domestic law enforcement . With more than 30 separate , highly classified government networks pumping information into NCTC headquarters , it has unfettered access to the crown jewels of the U.S. intelligence community-including raw cables from CIA spies and detailed FBI case files . One congressional staffer with knowledge of intelligence matters calls it a " miracle , " only half joking . " We 're the only place in the U.S. government where all that information comes together , " says retired Vice Adm . Scott Redd , the center 's director . " There are no boundaries in this business . " <p> Inside and outside the intelligence world , however , people are still confused about what the two-year-old organization is supposed to do-and what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senior leadership of the NCTC , which is supposed to become the primary hub for tracking and analyzing the terrorist threat . Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte calls it the single biggest change during his 18 months in office . " The center is really looked to as the principal source of analysis of these kinds of developments , " Negroponte tells U.S. News . The NCTC is still building up its ranks , but already it is butting up against the other agencies that work on terrorism , particularly the CIA , which has run its own Counter Terrorism Center since 1986 . <p> The 2004 law that formalized the NCTC also gives it a " strategic operational planning " role , which has taken some time to define . In some ways , it 's easier to explain what it is n't . Redd is quick to say that , unlike in the popular TV spy show 24 , they do n't go after any terrorists themselves . " Jack Bauer does n't live here , " he says . <p> NCTC officials might not be prowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawless borderlands . But the NCTC is , for the first time , trying to make sure that all the operational agencies do n't unwittingly trip over one another in the field . " NCTC is not directing operations , " says Brock . " We 're here just to kind of act as the air traffic controller and make sure everybody is talking . " Most of this work is so highly classified that it is difficult to discuss , but Brock tries to describe a recent example in general terms . During the daily 8 a.m. videoconference earlier this year , one intelligence agency announced that it had an imminent opportunity to capture a key terrorist suspect in a Middle Eastern country . Another agency piped up , warning that a productive source of intelligence might be lost if the suspect were nabbed . Brock asked the two agencies to work it out themselves , which they did ( although Brock declined to describe how ) . <p> Disney-esque . NCTC officials also monitor unfolding plots and investigations , producing continually updated reports called Threat Threads on the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Threat Threads at any given time ; on a recent Monday , the NCTC was tracking 11 different threats . A Thread report came in handy when , for example , the NCTC was coordinating the fast-moving investigation into this summer 's alleged plot in Britain to blow up as many as 10 aircraft using liquid explosives . At first , officials had been following the investigation from a distance , because it appeared to be a largely U.K. plot . <p> But after receiving what officials call " a very specific piece of intelligence " that the suspected plotters were targeting airplanes heading for the United States , the NCTC swung into high gear . Redd was at the White House every day as the investigation built to a climax . At the same time , his aides were helping to coordinate how much information was released to officials at key government agencies , particularly the Department of Homeland Security and its Transportation Security Administration . " They do n't need to know what we know about what 's going on in Pakistan , " says Redd . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the lookout for and how does this change our screening procedures . " <p> The NCTC 's showpiece is its 24-hour operations center . Designed with input from , among others , Walt Disney 's Imagineers , it looks like a film director 's version of a high-tech government command post . Giant screens dominate the front of the room , displaying anything from broadcast of an Arab satellite news channel or the radar map over New York City to a highly classified live feed from an armed Predator drone over Afghanistan . An NCTC watch team of at least a dozen people is on duty at all times , while the FBI and the CIA each maintain their own independent terrorism watch centers in the same space . " We are getting paid to say who knows about this information we 've just come across , who needs to know about it , and what are they doing about it , " says Don Loren , a retired naval officer who runs the operations center . <p> " Historic baggage . " Every watch officer can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire U.S. government . " We 're pretty much the cutting edge , " says an air marshal from the TSA assigned to the watch center for the past 18 months . " We 're the first ones to see it , and we push it to wherever it needs to go . " There are limits , however : To send a piece of raw intelligence from an agency 's operational files out to the rest of the community , an NCTC official must first secure the permission of the agency that issued it . <p> The bulk of the NCTC 's work remains on the analysis side . But the road to becoming the hub for U.S. counterterrorism analysis has been rocky . The NCTC ( and its predecessor organization , the Terrorist Threat Integration Center ) got off to a slow start . " Initially , there was a reluctance on the part of government agencies to let people from other agencies have access to their networks , " says John Brennan , who founded the Threat Integration Center and ran the NCTC for its first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCTC 's mission was . " <p> Getting enough experienced analysts was another problem , and the NCTC had several early tussles over personnel with the CIA 's CounterTerrorism Center . Officials insist the wrinkles have largely been ironed out . Negroponte , the director of national intelligence , took the first big step last year when he ordered some 90 CIA analysts to move over to the NCTC . Gen. Michael Hayden 's arrival as CIA director ( after a stint as the deputy DNI ) helped to further cement NCTC 's status . Almost immediately , Hayden dispatched an additional 28 analysts to NCTC , and he has pledged to send over 50 more in the next year . <p> Some critics worry that taking analysts from the CIA could harm the ability of its own CounterTerrorism Center to use analysis to target operations aimed at capturing or killing terrorists . But officials insist that , if anything , the new structure frees up the CIA 's center from much of the broader analytical work . " I actually think that NCTC may offer us better opportunities to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our activity here , quite legitimately and quite naturally , was focused in on supporting our operations , " Hayden tells U.S. News . " We ca n't take all of America 's analytic expertise and hard-wire it to any kill or capture operation . So I was willing to take the risk of shifting some of the weight of our analytic force from here to NCTC . " Another factor is the civil liberties concern of giving the CIA , which is barred from domestic spying , access to law enforcement case files . Hayden says that it is better to bridge that gap " in a new location , without any historic baggage to worry about . " <p> This summer , the CIA and the NCTC also agreed to adhere to what officials call " lanes in the road , " which lay out who is responsible for reporting on which general areas . It 's a tough balancing act , between reducing overlap on one side and ensuring competitive analysis on the other . " The worst thing in the world would be to have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire government because the ' groupthink ' syndrome comes into play , " says Andy Liepman , a career CIA official who now manages the 200 analysts inside the NCTC . <p> Liepman 's most active analysts work in the Al Qaeda and Sunni Affiliates group . One team in the group is dedicated solely to al Qaeda 's plotting inside the United States . " Most of the homeland plots we believe are credible have in their ancestry an al Qaeda brain , " says Liepman . Other groups look at all the other terrorist organizations , as well as their interest in weapons of mass destruction . A fourth tracks the logistical aspects of terrorism , including travel , financing , and communications . " You ca n't just disrupt the attack , " says Redd . " You have to go after every element of that life cycle . " <p> Critics have faulted the NCTC for weak analysis on longer-term strategic topics , such as which factors in Islamic societies help generate more terrorists . Part of it is a staffing problem-there is just so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have not been able to work the long-term strategic issues to our satisfaction , " says Dawn Scalici , a veteran CIA officer who is the deputy director for mission management at the NCTC . " We 're stretched pretty thin . " Eventually , NCTC officials plan to double the number of analysts . For now , more than half of the 200 analysts have less than three years ' experience working on counterterrorism issues . " The fact is that they do n't have the culture of analysis that the CIA has built up over decades , " says a recently retired intelligence analyst . " They need to develop the analytic tradecraft . " <p> The NCTC 's analysts do have one tremendous advantage-wide access to both domestic and foreign raw intelligence traffic . But their physical isolation from the bulk of the CIA 's regional and cultural experts could make it more difficult to detect emerging threats . " The analysts are further away from many of the specialists in the intelligence community , " says Paul Pillar , a 30-year veteran of the CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center . " Consultation with them would be essential to help have early warning . " Liepman counters that much of that contact is already happening in secure online forums these days . " There is a very good , very healthy , substantive discussion going on now between people who follow Hezbollah and people who follow Iran , " he says . " Just because they are not at NCTC or in the counterterrorism community , it does n't mean they do n't have a voice . " <p> The technological challenges have been daunting . When U.S. News visited the Terrorist Threat Integration Center three years ago , then director Brennan had five different computers under his desk to access all the different agencies ' networks . That problem remains , and , if anything , is even worse now that the NCTC has even greater access to data . In fact , with more than 30 computer networks wired into the NCTC , analysts in the operations center have to use multiple desks to access them all-the switching equipment they use to toggle between networks can accommodate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet search all the networks at the same time with a single command . That technology , says Chief Information Officer Bill Spalding , is still " a couple of years away . " <p> " The fight of a generation . " The deluge of information is intimidating . The NCTC maintains the intelligence community 's ever expanding central repository of suspected terrorists , called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment ( which is used to feed several terrorist watch lists , including the TSA 's no-fly list ) . Russ Travers , a career Defense Intelligence Agency official , manages a youthful team of 80 analysts who sort through the mass of reporting on possible terrorist names . Every day , the NCTC receives as many as 2,000 cables-containing some 5,000 to 7,000 names . The database has quadrupled to 400,000 names in three years ( although about 100,000 of the names are aliases ) . Further complicating the task is the fragmentary , often contradictory , nature of the intelligence and the language barrier . " Right away , you run into the whole problem with Arab names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ' Mohammed Mohammed ' from that ' Mohammed Mohammed ' can be a tremendous challenge for these young people . " <p> Perhaps the most ambitious part of the NCTC 's mission is its strategic operational planning function . As the " mission manager " for terrorism , the NCTC is supposed to work with the newly created DNI 's office , which is charged with reforming the intelligence community , to eliminate gaps in the U.S. counterterrorism effort as well as unnecessary overlap . Without direct command authority , however , the NCTC will have to rely on the DNI 's influence over the budget to help push change . It is unclear just how much clout either organization will have . <p> The NCTC has already issued several plans , including the first National Action Plan to Combat Foreign Fighters in Iraq , completed in June . Officials are now working on another , to counter terrorists ' use of the Internet . The most comprehensive effort is the now completed National Implementation Plan , a nearly 200-page document that has become the de facto war plan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , the classified plan assigns a lead agency to each of more than 500 different tasks related to the war on terrorism . Some of them are obvious , such as the FBI 's lead role in hunting terrorists at home . Others relate to the war of ideas and the need to quell violent Islamic extremism , an area where the State Department has many of the lead roles . The new plan tries to take a broader view , including goals like bolstering educational institutions that focus on Islam and the Muslim world . " This is the fight of a generation , " says Vice Adm . Bert Calland , a former deputy CIA director who is now the deputy director for strategic operational planning at the NCTC . " We need to start establishing processes and capabilities with that in mind . " Many experts are skeptical ; previous efforts by the Bush administration to do outreach to the Muslim world have foundered . <p> " Radicalization . " At the same time , the terrorist threat and the al Qaeda network have become increasingly diffuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible terrorist plotting appears to have some al Qaeda link back to Pakistan and Afghanistan , but officials are increasingly worried about individual extremists-particularly Muslim men already living here who may be drawn to jihad but who have no ties to known terrorist groups . " In looking at threat reporting on a daily basis , you tend to get a sense of issues of concern and things that might help us understand where radicalization is taking place , why it 's taking place , and what we need to be worried about in the future , " says principal deputy director Brock . " Radicalization happens in different ways , at different times , with different people , and that 's what makes it such a difficult problem . " <p> Redd offers a simple , if unsettling , way to measure their success : " Do the 5-year-olds of today turn into terrorists or do they decide there is something better out there ?
