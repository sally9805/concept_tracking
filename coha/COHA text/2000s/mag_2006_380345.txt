During a training session at Colorado 's Snowmass Mountain , near Aspen last week , a group of lite snowboarders who call themselves the Collection swooshed , spun and flipped over a curved channel , or half-pipe , changing the way their sport is played . <P> It 's more than rare talent alone that separates the Collection  --  whose members include teen phenoms Mason Aguirre , 18 , and Luke Mitrani , 15 ; 2002 Olympic gold medalists Ross Powers , 26 , and Kelly Clark , 22 ; 2005 X-Games silver medalist Andy Finch , 24 ; and Gretchen Bleiler , 24 , who is expected to take the women 's half-pipe gold in Torino  --  from the rest of the snowboarding world . The group , formed in 2004 , is the first rider-controlled team in the sport , operating outside the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association ( USSA ) , which oversees the U.S. national team . <P> The Collection picks its own coach , chooses where to compete and , most important , collects its own sponsorship dollars . Under USSA guidelines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore point for the boarders . " It seems like no matter how hard the snowboarders work , the money goes to the skiing side of things , " says Powers , who conceived the collective concept . " The Collection gives us the freedom to pick and choose what we want to do , and the money keeps going back into the team . " <P> The arrangement has worked , at least financially . Before the start of this season and last , Snickers , drawn to the young audience that snowboarding attracts , signed a handsome contract with the Collection . Nickelodeon and Yamaha have also inked deals with the maverick boarders . <P> Now the Collection is hoping to show that an independent team can shine in the Olympics . Powers is in solid position to defend his gold , and strong performances by Clark and Finch at the last Olympic qualifiers , Jan. 20-21 , could earn them a Torino trip too . Aguirre is a near lock for the team . <P> But it is Bleiler , who tests limits both on and off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clad in a painted-on bikini , she posed for a racy FHM cover before the 2004 X-Games . " It definitely crosses the line of my comfort zone , " she says . " I pushed myself . " She plans to push at the Olympics too . On her program is the Michaelchuck , a backflip trick that no woman has ever landed in competition . Bleiler credits her Collection teammates for some of her success . " We 're definitely having to bushwhack our way through this whole thing , but it 's exciting , " she says . " It 's kind of really coming together . "
