She was everywhere . Everywhere Graham turned and in everything he touched , she was there . Her reflection peered back at him when he looked in the mirror . She was a glimmer of light on a distant ocean . He felt her hand graze his while placing the oversized pillow on her favorite spot on the sofa . On the day he 'd gone fishing , there she was in all her radiant beauty , staring back at him through the ripples in the water , and he had jumped in to try and save her . xxx It was almost two months to the day since Amanda died . Graham had not ventured out of the house except for the day he 'd gone fishing with his buddies . He sat home day in and day out waiting for Amanda to return so they could resume their life together . But with the passing of time , his obsession left him scraping the bottom of loneliness . Today was going to be a new day , Graham promised himself . Self-pity had its place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he lay on the couch trying to make good on that promise , he was suddenly twenty again  --  a young man recently come to the Bay Area from St. Louis to follow a dream . xxx Graham 's best friend , Charlie Ford , had arrived inthe Bay Area a year earlier . Charlie 's Uncle Roscoe , or Roc as he preferred to be called , migrated to California after the war , finding work at the Naval Air Station in Alameda . Uncle Roc had invited Charlie to come out west after high school . Graham and Charlie went way back . They met at junior high school . Charlie was one year older and seven inches taller than Graham , although Graham swore he was six feet tall when he had his Sunday-go-to-meeting shoes on . Charlie had coal-black , wavy hair that appeared an iridescent blue depending on the light . Graham had a thick crown of self-made waves with the help of a little Murray 's hair pomade and a stocking cap . They were a pair . You 'd rarely see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm on and were not accustomed to being without a girl wrapped in each arm . Graham and Charlie played football in high school and were the main ingredient in a singing group they formed . Now Graham found himself in the Bay Area by way of Southern Pacific Railways with a shoebox filled with all his worldly possessions under his arm . Graham 's mother , Eula Mae Perry Peters , had died suddenly of a brain aneurism , one short year after his father died . So Graham set off to see the world , leaving his two younger sisters behind with his Aunt Rubye to care for them . It was Graham 's first week in Oakland . The city was all a-buzz  --  a little like St. Louis , except that there were more jobs for Negroes and maybe a chance to strike it rich . Striking it rich did n't seem to be a likely event in Graham 's immediate future unless he accidentally fell into it , but he did like the feel of the place he now called home . Charlie subletted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with him until he got on his feet . There would be no problem with Graham getting a job . Hire notices were posted all over the black community . Everyone was looking for young , strong Negro men to work in the Naval shipyard , lifting heavy cargo . But this was the weekend , and Graham was ready to see the sights . It had been a long , tedious ride on the train . The bright lights of the San Francisco Bay were a wonderful welcome mat for a young kid a long way from home . " Come on , Graham , " Charlie shouted . " The show 's gon na start in about an hour . Man , you and me will be back in business in no time  --  all the babes we want . " " Church , Charlie ? You 've got ta be kidding . All of those clubs we passed on the way in . I 'm sure we can find some good-looking girls there . I 'm ready to unwind a little , kick up my heels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a real woman , go to the church house . There 's a convention going on at this big church up on Market Street that 's about three blocks away and in walking distance . My man , Curtis MacArthur , swore up and down that there 's gon na be a lot of babes at the convention . They come from far and wide . Graham , man , you can take your pick  --  short ones , tall ones , skinny ones , fat if you like , but there 's enough to go around for seconds , thirds if you want . There 's gon na to be good music , eating and even a little preaching , but this is the place to be if you want the cream of the crop . " " Charlie , you are crazy . You should have been a car salesman . Anyway , I do n't have anything to wear . " " That 's no problem . Uncle Roc got plenty of suits . They might be a tad bit too big , but they 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . " You 're my buddy , and we 're a team . Now what kinda friend would I be strolling with a fine babe on my arm and my best friend sitting back in the room all by himself ? " " You do n't want me to answer that ... ? " " Go on , tell me . " " What makes you so sure any of these girls are gon na even look at you ? They 're lookin ' for preachers so they can become first ladies . No slick , jive-talking , unrepentant , tall , dreamy-eyed , dark-haired boy without an ounce of salvation got half a chance . " " I was counting on that tall , dreamy-eyed , dark-haired boy to do the trick . " They both laughed until it hurt . " You 're right , " Graham continued , " we are a pair , but you run on tonight . I 'll catch you in church another time . " " Suit yourself , buddy . You 're gon na wish you were there . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so . " " Get on and get out of here . I might take a walk later . " " Gon na try and sneak a peek , eh ? " " Catch you later . " Graham sat in the room contemplating life  --  what he was going to do tonight and then tomorrow . An hour had passed since Charlie left . It seemed the whole neighborhood had evaporated into the night  --  a hushed quiet that made Graham a bit wary . He jumped up and went to the window , but only the stars and the moon dared to stare back at him , the moon illuminating his face in the windowpane . Graham grabbed his jacket off the chair and headed out the door . He was n't sure where he was going , but he knew he needed to get out of that noiseless house  --  maybe hear a little music , ahh maybe some preaching , but he wanted to be where there was life and a little reminder of home . He headed West passing a few couples out strolling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . He continued another block , and the cars  --  Buicks , Packards , and Fords , inhabited every available space on either side of the street . Yeah , he would own one of them one day . Then he heard it , felt it reverberate throughout his body . It reminded him of thunder , cymbals crashing . Yes , someone was having a good time , and it did n't sound like the blues they were playing back at Slim 's in St. Louis . As Graham neared the big church on Market Street , a flurry of activity surrounded it . The building seemed to sway on its cinder blocks , careful not to empty its precious cargo from inside . It was ten p.m. , and although there seemed to be a lot going on inside the church , there was a lot happening outside as well . Small circles of young people milled about holding conversations . Suddenly , Graham was converged upon by a sea of purple and white choir robes which dutifully stretched into a single line waiting to march into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found . As Graham inched closer , a beautiful girl in her late teens emerged from the fellowship hall . She was about Graham 's height , give or take an inch . She wore the prettiest white silk suit and a white pill hat with a bow made of lace attached to the front . The ends of her hair were turned up in a shoulder-length flip that accentuated her nutmeg-colored skin . But it was the nut-brown legs that made Graham come from his hiding place . Graham stumbled over a workhorse that had been placed over an open manhole . He regained his composure and followed her right into church . He 'd forgotten for a moment that he was not dressed appropriately , but that did n't matter . Charlie was right ; " the crme de la crme " resided here . Someone called " Amanda , " and the girl with the nut-brown legs waved her hand . What a pretty name . Graham would have to move closer if he was going to say anything to her at all . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the music as the choir marched in . She looked his way again , and Graham locked upon her gaze and did n't let go . She seemed shy in a girlish sort of way , but Graham forged ahead . He pushed closer to her , the crowd unyielding until he was within an inch from touching her nose . " Hi , Amanda , " he said above the noise . She sneered at him , wrinkling up her nose . " Who are you , and how do you know my name ? " Amanda Carter demanded . " That 's a secret , " he said , even more mesmerized by her beauty . " My name is Graham . " He extended his hand . " I 'm going to be a preacher one day . " Graham saw the puzzled look on her face . " What does that have to do with me ? " she retorted , leaving his hand in mid-air . " Well ... I ... Would you like to go outside and talk for a few minutes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes cut a path down the length of his body and rested on his wrinkled khaki pants and blue pea coat that had doubled as a pillow on his trek to the west . " Sure , why not , " she said nonchalantly . " You seem harmless enough , but after this choir sings . They are so good . " Oh , if Charlie could see him now . Graham could tell Ms. Amanda liked the attention he was giving her , although she pretended she did n't . When the choir finished singing , they quietly went outside . They made small talk , but Graham was transfixed by her beauty ( eyes the color of ripe olives embedded in an oval , nutmeg-colored face ) and those beautiful nut-brown legs that he wished he could wrap his own around . Actually , he wanted to reach out and touch her , maybe place a kiss on those fine chiseled lips of hers that smelled of sweet berries when he got close enough to catch a whiff . There was something about Amanda that was different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the chance to be his lady . Graham Peters became a different person that night  --  his heart ached for Amanda Carter , a girl he had just met . If given half a chance , he would cherish her until the end of time .
