MOST PEOPLE LEFT BECAUSE of no water . I do n't know where they found a place where things were any better . Some of us felt safer here than anywhere else . And even way before the war wound down , it was hard to pick up and go someplace . No gas for civilians . Pretty soon no gas at all . <p> After the bombing of our pipeline ( one man with a grenade could have done that ) , we got together and moved the town up higher , along a stream and put in ditches so that the water came past several houses . We have to carry water into the house in buckets and we have to empty the sink by hand , back out into the yard . At least the water flows into our kitchen gardens and past our fruit trees . In warm weather , we bathe in our irrigation ditch , in colder we sponge off inside , in basins , but there 's hardly any cold weather anymore . <p> There was n't much to moving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the able-bodied men , of course , so it took us women to make the move ourselves and without horses or mules . The enemy stole them or killed them or maimed them just to make things harder for us . <p> No electricity , though some of the women think they can hook the dam back up and get some . Nobody has bothered to try it yet . In a way none of this bothers me as much as you 'd think . I always liked walking , and we have rendered fat lamps and candles that send out a soft , cozy glow . <p> Our house was already well above where the town used to be . Good because I did n't want to move . I want my brother to have our old home to come back to . And besides , I could n't move Mother . <p> Beyond our back yard there used to be the Department of Water and Power , after that Forest Service land , and then the John Muir wilderness . Now the town has moved above me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Our house has a good view . We always sat on the front steps and looked at the mountains . Now that everybody has moved up the mountain side , everybody has a good view . <p> The town below is empty . The Vons and K-mart are big looted barns . Up here there 's one small store where we sell each other our produce or our sewing and knitting . Especially socks . Hard to get socks these days . Before the war we were so wasteful nobody darned anymore , but now.we not only darn but reinforce the heels and toes of brand new socks before we wear them . <p> We moved the little library up . Actually it 's got more books than before . We brought all the books we could find , ours and those from the people who left . We do n't need a librarian . Everybody brings them back honor system . <p> We have a little hospital but no doctors , just a couple of elderly nurses who were too old to be recruited . They 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . No medicines though . Only what we can get from local herbs . We went to the Paiute to find out more . There 's a couple of Paiute nurses , who come to help out every now and then , though they have their own nursing to do on the reservation . ( They moved the rez up , too , and they do n't call it the reservation anymore . ) <p> It 's a woman 's town now . Full of women 's arts and crafts .... Quilt makers , sweater knitters .... And the women do the heavy work . There 's a good roof repair group and there 's carpenters .... <p> Lots of women went to war along with the men , but I had to look after Mother . I was taking care of her even before my brother left . She was n't exactly sick but she was fat and she drank . Her legs looked terrible , full of varicosities . It hurt her to walk so she did n't . When the war came she got a little better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homemade beer , but she could n't walk . Or would n't . I think her muscles had all withered away . Looking after somebody who ca n't walk seems normal to me . I 've done it since I can first remember anything . <p> Now that Mother 's gone I have a chance to do something useful . If I knew the war was still going on in some specific place , I 'd go fight , but it seems to be over . Maybe . It did n't stop exactly . I do n't know how it ended or even if it 's ended . We do n't have a way to find out , but there has n't been any action that we know of for quite some time . Overhead , nothing flies by . Not even anything old fashioned . ( Not that we ever had any action to speak of way out here . Except for the bombing of our pipeline and stealing our livestock , nobody cared much about us . ) <p> But that 's the way the war was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like they used to be - with two clearly separated sides . The enemy was among us even before it started . They could never win a real old-fashioned war with us , they were weak and low tech , but low tech was good enough as long as there were lots of them . You never knew who to trust , and we still do n't . Our side put all we could in internment camps , practically everybody with black eyes and hair and olive skin , but you ca n't get them all . And then the war went on so long we used up all our resources , but they still had theirs - sabotage does n't ever have to stop . They escaped from the camps . Actually they just walked away . The guards had already walked away , too . <p> Lots of those men brought their injuries and craziness to our mountains . Both sides came here to get away from everything . They 're hermits . They do n't trust anybody . Some of them are still fighting each other up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine fields . They 're all damaged , physically or mentally . Of course most likely all of us are , too , and we probably do n't even know it . <p> My brother might be out there somewhere . If he 's alive he 's got to be here . He loves this place . He hunted and trapped and fished . He 'd get along fine and I know he 'd do anything to come back . <p> Most of those men do n't come down to us even if they 're starving or cold or sick . Those that do , come to steal . They take our tomatoes and corn and radishes . Other things disappear , too . Kitchen knives , spoons , fishhooks .... And of course sweaters and woolen socks .... Those crazies live up even higher than we do . It does still get cold up there . <p> And they are crazies . And now one of them has been killing other men and dumping them at the edge of the village . They 've all been shot in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope it is n't one of our side . Though I do n't suppose sides matter anymore . <p> Every time this happens , before we put them into the depository , I go to check if it 's my brother . I would n't want my brother in the depository . Ever . But those men are always feuch a mess - dirty and bearded - I wonder , would I recognize him ? I keep thinking : How could I not ? But I was only fifteen when he left . He was eighteen . He 'd be thirty-two now . If he 's alive . <p> We 're all a little edgy even if it 's not us getting killed . And then last night I saw someone looking in my window . I 'd been asleep but I heard a noise and woke up . I saw the silhouette of a lumpy hat and a mass of tangled hair flying out from under it , the moonlit sky glowing behind . I called out , " Clement ! " I did n't mean to . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my brother . Whoever it was ducked down in a hurry and I heard the crunch , crunch of somebody running away . Afterwards I got scared . I could have been shot as I slept . <p> The next morning I saw footprints and it looked like somebody had spent some time behind my shed . <p> I keep hoping it 's my brother , though I would n't want him to be the one killing those poor men , but you 'd think he would n't be afraid of coming to his own house . Of course he does n't know that Mother is dead . I can understand him being afraid of her . They never got along . When she was drunk she used to throw things at him . If he got close enough , she 'd grab his arm and twist . Then he got too strong for her . But he could n't be afraid of me . Could he ? I 'm the baby sister . <p> Mother was nicer to me . She got worried I 'd stay out of reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and left her but until she died I did n't think of it . I actually did n't . I 'd looked after her for so long I thought that 's just the way life is . And I might not have left , anyway . She was my mother and there was nobody else to look after her but me . <p> If it 's my brother been looking in the window , he must know Mother is n't here . She never left her bed . The house is small and all on one floor so he could have looked in all the windows . We have three tiny bedrooms , and one kitchen/living room combined . Mother and her big bed took up wall to wall space in the biggest bedroom . <p> I POSTED CLEMENT 'S picture at the store and the library , but of course it was a picture from long ago . In it he has the usual army shaved head . I drew a version with wild hair . Then I drew another of him bald with wild hair around the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew a different kind of beard on each of them . I put up both versions . <p> Leo at the store said , " He might not want to talk to you .. . or anybody . " <p> But I know that already . <p> " I think he 's come looking in my window . " <p> " Well , there you are . He 'd a come in if he 'd wanted to . " <p> " You went to war . How come you 're okay and most all the other men have gone wild ? " <p> " I was lucky . I never saw real horror . " <p> Actually he may not be so okay . Most of us never married . We never had the chance with all the men gone . He could have married one of us but he never did . He lives in a messy shed behind the store and he smells , even though the ditch passes right by his store . And he 's always grumpy . You have to get used to him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going out to look for him in all his favorite spots . " <p> " Even if you find him he wo n't come back . " <p> " So then I 'll go after that crazy person who 's been killing those men . " <p> Truth is , I do n't know what to do with myself . I do n't know how to live with just me to care about . I can go anywhere and do anything . I ought to find the man who 's the killer . I have nothing else to do . Who better to do it than I ? <p> But I might find that man right here , hiding at the edge of the village - or most likely looking in my window . Maybe I can trap him in my house . He must have been looking in for a reason . <p> I pack up and pretend to leave . I stay out of sight of the village . This is wild rocky land - lots of hiding places . Nobody will know I did n't go anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pepper is hard to get these days so I 've saved mine for a weapon . I have a small knife in my boot and a bigger one at my belt . Streams are n't stocked anymore but there 's still fish around , though not as many as before . I bring a line and hooks . I 'll use those today . I wo n't go far . <p> I catch a trout . I have to make a fire the old-fashioned way . No more matches . I always carry a handful of dead sage fibers for tinder . I cook the fish and eat it . After dark and the half moon comes up , I sneak back to our house as if I was one of those crazies myself . <p> The door is wide open . There 's sand all over the floor . Could n't he even shut the door ? These days we have sand storms and dust devils more often than we used to . Does n't whoever it is know that ? And that 's another reason to move higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I smell him before I see him . I put my knife up my sleeve so it 'll drop down into my hand . <p> I can hear him breathing . Sounds like scared breathing . A man this frightened will be dangerous . <p> He 's huddled in Mother 's bedroom down between the bed and the bedside table . All I see is his hat , pulled low so his face is in shadow . I see his bare knees showing through his torn pants . I have a better look at them than his face . <p> Right away I think my brother would n't be in Mother 's room , he 'd be in his own room . Besides , the room still smells of death and dying . I call , " Clement ? " even though I know it ca n't be him . " Come on out . " <p> He groans . <p> " Are you sick ? " He sounds sick . I suppose that 's why he 's here in the first place . <p> I wish I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight , but there is n't much shining in here . It still could be my brother , under all that dirt and wild hair and beard , gone crazy just like everybody else . <p> " Come out . Come to the main room . I 'll light a lamp . I 'll fix you food . " <p> " Nolight . " . , <p> " Why not ? There 's only me . And there 's no war going on anymore . It 's most likely over . " <p> " I pledged to fight until I died . " <p> ( I suppose my brother did , too . ) <p> I finger my knife . " I 'm going to go light the lamp . " <p> I deliberately turn my back . I go to the main room , light the lamp with the sparker , keeping my back to the bedroom door . I hear him come in . I turn and get a good look . <p> Pieced-together hat , long scraggly hair hanging under it . I ca n't tell if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dirty . A full beard with gray in it . Eyes as black as the enemy 's always are . Eyebrows just as thick as theirs . He has a broken front tooth . Nowadays that 's not unusual . Nobody to fix them . He has a greenish look under his tan and dark circles around his eyes . If he thinks he is n't sick he does n't know much . <p> " You are the enemy . And you 're half dead already . " <p> There 's a chair right beside him , but he sinks sideways to the floor . Ends up flat on our worn linoleum . If he thinks he 's still fighting the war , I should kill him now while I have the chance . He looks such a mess and smells so bad I 'm almost ready to kill him just for those reasons alone . After Mother died I thought I was finished with disagreeable messes . <p> " Hide me . Just for tonight . I 'll leave in the morning . " <p> " Are you crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one killing people . I should kill you right now . " <p> He 's trying to prop himself up against the wall . I do n't want to touch him but I grab his shirt front to help him and the rotten cloth rips completely out . <p> " You stink something awful . And why would I think you wo n't kill me ? You 've been killing everybody else . " <p> " I do n't have a weapon . " <p> " Strip . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Take those filthy clothes off . I 'll burn them . I 'll bring you a basin to wash in . " ( And I 'll find out if he has a weapon . ) <p> He has n't the energy to undress or wash . I hate to touch him but I do it . I 'm used to it . Mother was a mess as she was dying . ( At the end I sprinkled pine needles all over but it did n't help much . ) I thought that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . I thought I was free . But , all right , one more thing . I wash him and dress him in my brother 's old clothes , and ... what then ? If I kill him , the town will be grateful . <p> At least his body is entirely different from Mother 's , thin and strong and hairy . It 's a nice change . If he was n't so smelly I 'd enjoy it . Well , I do enjoy it . <p> He 's half asleep through it all . <p> I burn his clothes in our little stove . After I 've washed him , I feed him jerky broth with an egg in it , though I keep thinking : Why waste my egg on him ? He falls asleep right after he 's finished the broth . Slides down the wall flat out again , in what seems more a faint than a sleep . <p> I decide to shave him and cut his hair . He wo n't notice . If he 'd been more conscious I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goatee but I 'm glad he is n't . I have fun with different haircuts , different sideburns , smaller and smaller mustaches until there 's none . Hair , too . I take off more than I meant to , except what does it matter , he 's a dead man . <p> Not a very handsome man whatever way I fixed his hair and beard , though along the way there were some nicer stages - better than what I ended up with . I finish by shaving him . Also not a good job . I make nicks . Where I shaved his beard , his skin is pale . His forehead , where his hat was , is pale too . There 's only a sun-browned strip across his face just below his eyes . I like the maleness of him no matter that he 's ugly . I do n't mind his broken tooth . We 're all in the same boat as to teeth . <p> I fall asleep at the kitchen table , right in the middle of thinking up ways to kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , in the olden days , I 'd not ever have been thinking things at all like that . <p> IN THE MORNING he seems some better - well enough for me to help him stagger , first to the outhouse , and then into my brother 's room . He keeps feeling his face and hair . I stop at the hall mirror and let him take a look . He 's shocked . He has a kind of wet cat/plucked chicken look . <p> I say , " Sorry . " I am sorry ... sorry for anybody who gets their hair cut by me . But he should be glad I have n't slit his throat . <p> He stares at himself , but then says , " Thank you . " And so sincerely that I realize I 've made him the best disguise there is . He said , " Hide me , " and I did . Nobody will take him for one of those wild men now . <p> I prop him up on the pillows of my brother 's bed and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better I wonder .... If he 's not going to die on his own , I 'll have to think what to do with him . <p> " What 's your name ? " <p> He does n't answer . He could say anything . I 'd have believed him and I 'd have had something to call him by . <p> " Tell me a name . I do n't care what . " <p> He thinks , then says , " Jal . " <p> " Make it Joe . " <p> I do n't trust him . But if he has any sense at all he knows I 'm the only one can keep him safe . Though nobody has much sense anymore . <p> " Everybody got tired of the war a long time ago . " I bang my cup down so hard that my tea spills . " Have n't you noticed ? " <p> " I swore to fight to the death . " ' <p> " I 'll bet you do n't even know which side is which anymore . If you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the planet . It was n't us . It was you and your greed . " <p> I have n't been so aggravated since my brother was around . " It heated up mostly by itself . It 's done that before , you know . Besides , all that 's over . Our part in it anyway . Killing crazies is n't going help . You 're crazy ! " Not the best thing to say to a crazy , but I go on anyway . " All you hermits are crazy . You 're nothing but trouble . " <p> He 's taking it all in .... Maybe he is . Maybe he just does n't have the energy to argue . <p> " I 'm going out to get us a rabbit . If you want to keep on making trouble , do n't be here when I come back . " ; <p> I leave . He 'll be all alpne with my butcher knife and pepper . And I suppose his crossbow is n't far off . I might as well give him a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds of my traps . They 're lower down . I 've set them around the town . It 's a ghost town . I 'm the only one goes down there now and then ... usually only on a cool day . Which hardly ever happens . Today it must be well over 110 . Now our whole valley in winter is as if Death Valley in summer . <p> What I trap down there are rats . We cook those up and call them rabbit , though nobody cares anymore what we call them . <p> I find two big black ones , big as cats . We like those better than the small brown kind , lots more meat on them . ( seems as if the rats are getting bigger all the time . ) My traps broke their necks . I do n't have to worry about killing them . I tie their tails to my belt , then wander the town in hopes of finding something not already scavenged . I find a quarter . I take it though it 's worthless . Maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't climb back up to my house until late afternoon and until I drink all the water I brought . <p> Before I go in I check around my shed and house for a crossbow and darts , and then beyond , under the bushes , but I do n't find them . <p> He 's still there . Asleep . And no weapons that I can see , but I check the kitchen knives . The largest one , big as a machete , is gone . And he might be pretending to be sicker than he is . <p> Enemy or not , I do like a man in the house . I watch him sleep . He has such long eyelashes . I like the hair on his knuckles . Just looking at his hands makes me think how there 's so few men around . Actually only four . His forearms .... Ours do n't ever look like that no matter how much we saw and hammer . Even my brother 's never looked like that . I like that he already needs a shave again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to go clean rats . <p> When I start rattling around the kitchen section of our main room , he gets up and staggers to the table . Stops at the hall mirror again on the way and studies himself for a long time . As if he forgot what he looked like under all that hair . He sits , then , and watches me make two-rat stew with wild onions and turnips . I thicken it with acorn flour I traded for with the Paiute . <p> It takes a while for the stew to finish up . I make squaw tea and sit across from him . Being so close and looking into his eyes upsets me . I have to get up and turn my back . I pretend the stew needs stirring . To hide my feelings I say , " Where 's your crossbow ? And where 's my knife ? I wo n't let you have my stew until you tell me . " I sound more angry than I meant to . <p> " Under the bed in the big room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there they are , and several darts . I bring the bow back to the table . It 's a beautiful piece of work . Old scraps of metal and an old screw , salvaged from something , now shiny and oiled . The wood of the bow , carved as if a work of art . All kept up with care . I 'll bring it to the town meeting to show I 've found the killer and dealt with him . But have I ? And they may want a body . <p> " I 'll not shoot anybody . Not now . " <p> " Yeah . But you 're still sworn . " <p> " I can fight someplace else . " <p> " Oh yeah . " <p> After we eat I put what 's left over into an old bear-proof can , take it to the irrigation ditch , and sink it in wet mud to keep it cool .. <p> I do n't know if I should go to bed without barricading my door some way . I wish I still had our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd be dead by now anyway . It would be nice to have him , though . I 'd feel a lot safer . He was a good dog but getting old . We thought we 'd better eat him ourselves before somebody else got to him . That was before we were eating rats . <p> Tired as I am , it takes a while for me to get to sleep . I keep telling myself , if he 's going to sneak into my room , I might as well find out about it . But I put the chair against the door in a way that it 'll fall . At least I 'll hear if he comes in . <p> Mainly I ca n't sleep because , in spite of my better judgment , I 'm thinking of keeping the man . Trying to . I like the idea of having him around even though it 's scary . I make plans . <p> It 's logical that somebody coming in to our new higher village would come to my house first . Perhaps an outsider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'd take him to a town meeting to tell the news . <p> What news , though ? In the morning ( the chair has n't fallen ) , we make some up . Carson City is as empty and rat-infested as our town . ( It 's a good bet it really is . ) I remember an airplane ( I think it was called the gossamer condor ) that flew by the propeller being pumped by a bicycle and does n't need gas . It ca n't go far or we 'd have seen it down here . Joe can say he 's seen it . <p> He says , " How about an epidemic of a new disease passed on by fleas ? It has n't reached here yet . " He says , " How about , way up in Reno , they found a cache of ammunition so they can clean up their old guns and use them again ? " <p> I give him news about Clement to tell people . I 'll say that 's another reason Joe came to me first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I made up that news because I know my brother 's dead . Otherwise I 'd not have mentioned anything about him . I 'd keep on thinking he 's out in our mountains as one of the crazies , but I do n't think A ever really believed that . I just hoped . ) <p> Once he takes my hand and squeezes it - says how grateful he is . I have to get up again , turn my back . I wash our few dishes , slowly . I 'm so flustered I hardly know what his hand felt like . Strong and warm . I know that . <p> Lots of good things happen in those town meetings . We give each other our news . We have all kinds of helping committees . In some ways we take care of each other more than we did before the war . People used to bring in their deer and wild sheep and share the meat around , except there 's less and less wild game and more and more mountain lions . They 're eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions . I 'll bet Joe would be , with his crossbow . <p> So I bring him to the meeting . Introduce him . They crowd around and ask questions about all their favorite spots , or places where they used to have relatives . He 's good at making stuff up . Makes me wonder , was he once an officer ? Or did he act ? <p> I admire him more and more , and I can see all the women do , too . He could have any one of us . I 'm worried he 'll get away from me and I 'm the only one knows who he really is . Whoever gets him in the end will have to be careful . <p> He 's looking pretty good , too , horrible haircut and all . My brother 's blue farmer shirt sets off his brown skin . It 's too large for him , but that 's the usual . <p> The women have been out at the bird nets and had made a big batch of little-bird soup . I was glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a Paiute woman who comes to our meetings and reports back to the reservation . She 's beautiful - more than beautiful , strange and striking . I should have known . At his first view of her you can see ... both of them stare and then , quickly , stop looking at each other . <p> Later he sits drinking tea with several women including the Paiute . They all crowd around but I saw him push in so that he was next to her . The tables are small but now nine chairs are wedged in close around the one where he sits . I ca n't see what 's going on , but I do see her shoulder is touching his . And their faces are so close I do n't see how they can see anything of each other . <p> I sneak away and run home . I wish I 'd saved his smelly , falling-apart clothes . I wish I 'd saved the dirty , tangled hair I cut off , but I burned that , too . I do find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bring the crossbow . It also helps that he tries to get away . <p> They hung Joe up in the depository . I told them not to tell me anything about it . I 'd rather not know when we get around to using him . <p> Author Affiliation
