Ten years after the surrender of George III 's army to General Washington at Yorktown , British Freedom was hanging on in North America . Along with a few hundred other souls  --  Scipio Yearman , Phoebe Barrett , Jeremiah Piggie and Smart Feller among them  --  he was scratching a living from the stingy soil around Preston , a few miles northeast of Halifax , Nova Scotia . 1 // Like most of the Preston people , British Freedom was black and had come from a warmer place . Now he was a hardscrabbler stuck in a wind-whipped corner of the world between the blue spruce forest and the sea . But he was luckier than most . British Freedom had title to forty acres , and another one and a half of what the lawyers ' clerks in Halifax were pleased to call a " town lot . " 2 It did n't look like much of a town , though , just a dirt clearing with rough cabins at the centre and a few chickens strutting around and maybe a mud-caked hog or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of oxen to clear the land of bald grey rocks grew patches of beans and corn and cabbages , which they carted to market in Halifax along with building lumber . But even those who prospered  --  by Preston standards  --  took themselves off every so often into the wilderness to shoot some birch partridge , or tried their luck on the saltwater ponds south of the village . 3 // What were they doing there ? Not just surviving . British Freedom and the rest of the villagers were clinging to more than a scrap of Nova Scotia ; they were clinging to a promise . Some of them even had that promise printed and signed by officers of the British army on behalf of the king himself , that the bearer so-and-so was at liberty to go wherever he or she pleased and take up whatever occupation he or she chose . That meant something for people who had been slaves . And the king 's word was surely a bond . In return for their loyal service in the late American war , the Black Pioneers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unimaginably precious worth : their freedom and their acres . It was , they told themselves , no more than their due . They had done perilous , dirty , exhausting work . They had been spies amidst the Americans ; guides through the Georgia swamps ; pilots taking ships over treacherous sandbars ; sappers on the ramparts of Charleston as French cannonballs took off the limbs of the men beside them . They had dug trenches ; buried bodies blistered with the pox ; powdered the officers ' wigs ; and , marching smartly , drummed the regiments in and out of disaster . The women had cooked and laundered and nursed the sick ; dabbed at the holes on soldiers ' bodies ; and tried to keep their children from harm . Some of them had fought . There had been black dragoons in South Carolina ; waterborne gangs of black partisans for the king on the Hudson River ; bands of black guerrillas who would descend on Patriot farms in New Jersey and take whatever they could , even ( if the Lord was smiling on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed . They had been given their liberty , and some of them even got land . But the soil was thin and strewn with boulders , and the blacks had no way , most of them , to clear and work it unless they hired themselves or their families out to the white loyalists . That meant more cooking and laundering ; more waiting on table and shaving pink chins ; more hammering rocks for roads and bridges . And still they were in debt , so grievously that some complained their liberty was no true liberty at all but just another kind of slavery in all but name . // But names counted . British Freedom 's name said something important : that he was no longer negotiable property . For all its bleak hardships , Preston was not a Georgia plantation . Other Prestonians  --  Decimus Murphy , Caesar Smith  --  had evidently kept their slave names as they had made the passage to liberty . But British Freedom must have been born , or bought , as someone else . He may have shaken off that name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-one sailings out of New York in 1783 , which had taken thirty thousand loyalists , black and white , to Nova Scotia , for no one called British Freedom is listed in the " Book of Negroes , " which recorded those who , as free men and women , were at liberty to go where they wished . There were certainly others who changed their names to reflect their new status : James Lagree , for instance , the former property of Thomas Lagree of Charleston , became , in Nova Scotia , Liberty Lagree . It is also possible that British Freedom could have found his way to Nova Scotia in one of the earlier loyalist evacuations  --  from Boston in 1776 or from Charleston in 1782 . In the frightening months between the end of the war and the departure of the British fleets , as American planters were attempting to locate the whereabouts of escaped slaves , many of them changed their names to avoid identification . British Freedom may just have gone one step further in giving himself an alias that was also a patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trials he was presently enduring , British Freedom 's choice of name proclaims something startling : a belief that it was the British monarchy rather than the new American republic that was more likely to deliver Africans from slavery . Although Thomas Jefferson , in the Declaration of Independence , had blamed " the Christian King " George III for the institution of slavery in America , blacks like British Freedom did not see the king that way at all . On the contrary , he was their enemy 's enemy and thus their friend , emancipator and guardian . // Looking to the King of England as a benefactor had a long tradition . When plans for a slave uprising in Raritan County , New Jersey , were discovered in 1730 , one of the black informers told a Dr Reynolds that the cause . . . //
