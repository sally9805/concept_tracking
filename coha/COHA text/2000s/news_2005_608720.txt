<p> Over the past decade , Rep. Richard H. Baker has been ignored , dismissed and , once , threatened with a lawsuit by representatives of Fannie Mae , the District-based mortgage-lending giant that his congressional committee helps oversee . <p> So the Louisiana Republican was shocked this year when Fannie Mae 's interim chief executive , Daniel H. Mudd , handed him his cell phone number and invited him to call anytime . Baker did so a few days later and Mudd telephoned back almost immediately even though he was traveling overseas . <p> " In the past I had always been greeted with a dismissive approach , told that the CEO was a very busy person and then had to wait a long time for anyone to call back , often not the CEO , " Baker said . " Now the company is very responsive . I am entering territory that I 've never been before . " <p> Fannie Mae , the biggest U.S. mortgage finance company , has been compelled by an accounting scandal to take a different approach as members of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Once considered a fearsome force on Capitol Hill that repeatedly shot down such proposals , the federally chartered company  --  and its smaller cousin in the home-finance business , Freddie Mac  --  has accepted its weakened status and is trying to quietly temper and shape the legislation rather than kill it outright . <p> In place of a strategy that lawmakers regarded as bullying , Fannie Mae now emphasizes its eagerness to listen and to make its executives accessible . Its army of lobbyists has been reduced by a third and instructed not to swarm the Capitol as it once did . The company no longer targets lawmakers with acid-toned television commercials , instead working more closely with the housing industry to accomplish its goals . <p> " Their behavior has undergone a sea change , " said Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R-Neb . ) . " They had this town wired like no industry in America and everybody was scared to death to take them on . But now I sense more humility on their part . " <p> " They were 800-pound gorillas , " agreed Rep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " They are much more interested in finding consensus . " <p> In the past two years , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to admit and then remedy huge financial irregularities and , as a result , replace their top managers . As a way to bolster their stock prices and their standing in the marketplace , the companies have reversed earlier objections and now enthusiastically support creation of a new federal regulator with enough authority to stop such problems from recurring . <p> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are still lobbying , of course , and their friends in the housing industry have stepped up their efforts to compensate for the companies ' retrenchment . The National Association of Home Builders , for example , has told lawmakers that it may fight to defeat the bill if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are restricted too much . <p> But largely because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's cooperation , lawmakers do n't expect the legislation to fail . For the first time in memory , the companies are only quibbling over legislation that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not whether they will be more tightly controlled , but by how much . The focus of debate now is whether Congress will limit the size of the companies or ask the new regulator to do so . <p> Drafting of the bill is scheduled to begin this week in the House Financial Services Committee . <p> " It 's important for us to play a cooperative , constructive role ; this is the year to get legislation passed , " said Timothy J. McBride , Freddie Mac 's chief lobbyist . " Our enterprise has been through a difficult period . This is hardly the time for arrogance . Our role is not to threaten , not to bully , not be a legislative bulldozer but to convince policymakers we 're serious about our task . " <p> " Our goal is to be invited back , " said Duane S. Duncan , Fannie Mae 's top lobbyist . <p> Fannie Mae lobbyists were notorious for telling lawmakers and their aides what the company 's position was , and making it clear that they were expected to agree . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condescending attitude of Franklin D. Raines , Fannie Mae 's former chief executive . <p> " He Raines was inflexible , had a little bit of a tin ear and was offended if it seemed like people were being critical of him , " said Rep. Barney Frank ( D-Mass . ) . <p> Fannie Mae once retained Kenneth W. Starr , the special prosecutor who investigated President Bill Clinton , to prevent lawmakers from disclosing a document that detailed the annual incomes of the company 's senior officers . Starr threatened to sue Baker in 2003 to keep the report private , Frank said . Baker finally disclosed the list during a congressional hearing a year later , but only after consulting several legal experts who assured him that he would n't be held personally liable . <p> " I 'm not a wealthy man , " Baker said . " I did n't want to take what little I had and give it to Fannie Mae . " <p> But now , Duncan said , " we 're striking a different tone . " <p> He and McBride recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highhanded tactics . Duncan was especially pointed . Speaking to 15 lobbyists in a conference room at Fannie Mae 's headquarters early this month , Duncan said the company 's effort to pass the legislation was so sensitive , complex and important to the company that the lobbyists should avoid even talking to lawmakers about it . " Unless you 're called on , do n't engage on the bill , " he said . <p> Fannie Mae has retreated so far that insiders say Freddie Mac is now playing the feistier role . " Fannie , which used to be the biggest junkyard dog , is taking a back seat to Freddie Mac , " said Robert R. Davis , executive vice president of America 's Community Bankers , a trade association of banks and savings institutions . One reason , he speculated , is that Fannie Mae 's financial foul-up is fresher in lawmakers ' minds . Freddie Mac owned up to its problems in 2003 and reduced its estimated earnings by $5 billion , more than a year before Fannie Mae 's estimated $9 billion in earnings overstatements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tandem with housing industry groups . But lately they have been leaning harder than ever on those allies to make their case for them . Davis said he 's been getting more phone calls from company executives asking his organization to write letters to lawmakers , including one recently that objected to part of a bill by Hagel . " Compared to two years ago , we 've been getting more calls from Fannie and Freddie , " Davis said . <p> The National Association of Home Builders has been especially outspoken . The association 's chief executive , Gerald M. Howard , complained that he had been excluded from a meeting last month between Frank and the chief executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . Howard told Dow Jones News Service that he was worried that the executives were in such a hurry to complete the legislation that they might be too accommodating and pinch off the supply of financing that home builders need . <p> Howard declined to be interviewed for this article . <p> The sudden reticence by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgment by executives that the scandals have so depleted the firms ' credibility that lobbyists would n't be much help anyway . " No one would be surprised by the thesis that Freddie and Fannie had more impact on the outcome of legislation in the past than we do today , " McBride said . <p> " For years , Freddie and Fannie controlled the terrain on the Hill , " said Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( R-Ala. ) , chairman of the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee . But their actions and attitude these days are " light-years away . " <p> Last year , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spent a total of $24.2 million on lobbying and were each among the top 20 corporate spenders in the nation on lobbying , according to PoliticalMoneyLine , which compiles political finance and lobbying information . This year they have reduced their budgets for contract lobbyists by about a third and may trim more . <p> Fannie Mae has also cut out the millions of dollars it spent annually on TV issue ads and has curbed its grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom it considered essential to legislation affecting the company . <p> So far , a bill to create a new oversight agency appears on track . Then again , the company 's history of testiness is n't being overlooked by lawmakers . <p> " I 've told them that I hope they will continue to support us , " Shelby said . " But we 'll soon know for sure whether they 're with us or against us. "
