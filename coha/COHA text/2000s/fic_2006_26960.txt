Oblivion A Novel Chapter One Nick Petrov , in the witness box , waited for the next question . The lawyer for the accused looked up from his yellow pad and fastened his skeptical gaze  --  familiar to millions of cable talk show viewers  --  on Petrov 's face . The lawyer had eyebrows like Einstein 's , resembled him in general , Petrov thought , but with a better haircut . Perfume from the previous witness still hung in the air . " Been quite the career , " said the lawyer , " has n't it , Mr. Petrov ? So far . " A better haircut and a meaner disposition . " That 's not for me to say , " Petrov said . He 'd been on the stand for twenty-eight minutes , long enough to have formed the opinion that there was only one juror to worry about  --  the middle-aged woman in the back row , a lapis butterfly brooch on her lapel . The eleven other faces said guilty in the first degree , at least to him ; but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written all over it .

" I 'm more like a leaf blower , " Petrov said . Some people laughed ; but not the butterfly woman . " You think this is funny ? " said the lawyer . Petrov remained silent , and the lawyer , perhaps slightly off-stride , did n't demand an answer . He flipped through the yellow pad in an irritated way . Petrov , habitual noticer of little things , saw that his eyes were n't moving , meaning he was n't actually reading .

" Question , " said the court reporter . " What did the defendant say on the ride back from Mexico ? Answer : He said , ' You got me . ' " " ' You got me , ' " said the lawyer , facing the jury . " Sounds definitive . Practically an admission of guilt . " He spun around to Petrov . " But in your deposition of June eleven , you stated the defendant 's words were ' What makes you think it was me ? ' Not an admission of guilt , more like the aggrieved response of an innocent man .

" Are you aware of what would happen to your license if you put yourself in the position of giving false testimony ? " " I am aware , " Petrov said . He met the lawyer 's gaze . " In the deposition , I was asked only what the defendant 's first words were  --  ' What makes you think it was me ? ' It was after I explained the leads I 'd followed that he made the second remark  --  ' You got me . ' There was also a third remark , just before I turned him over . " Silence .

A vein throbbed in his neck and his face swelled and reddened , the effect phallic , out of control , dangerous : one of those electric courtroom moments that happened mostly in stories . The butterfly woman recoiled . The judge banged her gavel . The marshals moved in . There were no further questions . Petrov stepped down . One of the marshals gave him a discreet pat on the back on the way out . The Santa Ana was blowing , hot and dry .

Her eyes were the anxious eyes of a prospective client . " My name 's Liza , " she said . She came to a stop , rocking back slightly on her high heels . " Lisa , really , but Liza professionally .
