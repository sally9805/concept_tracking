Flora Sheldon Bush was fuming . Her thirteen-year-old son , Prescott , was supposed to have spent that August of 1908 at a New Jersey sports resort with a classmate and his family . Flora 's husband , Samuel Prescott Bush , had sent the boy there to play tennis , while Flora , their two daughters , Mary and Margaret , their younger son , Jim , Samuel 's mother , Harriet , and the family nanny were spending the month at the East Bay Lodge in Osterville , Massachusetts . But Prescott had abruptly been sent home by his friend 's mother , Mrs. Dods . Flora 's regal mother-in-law , Harriet Fay Bush , urged her to demand an explanation and an apology from Mrs. Dods , but Flora , whose social instincts were unerring in these matters , restrained herself . " I am not ready for that , " she wrote to her husband . " I think I may hear from Mrs. D. and if so , you must forward the letter ... for nothing has ever happened that raised my indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few days later Flora again mentioned her vexation : " Your mother is quite sure I ought to write Mrs. Dods . It scarcely seems right . I resent it all more than anything I have experienced . " // The unexpected change in Prescott 's plans upset his father , who worried that the incident might have been Prescott 's fault . If so , that might affect his acceptance into St. George 's School in the fall . But after hearing her son 's side of the story , Flora tried to assure her husband that the youngster was not entirely to blame : // I am sorry you are disappointed in Prescott and yet I am not surprised . He is of course a boy of very tender years . And I sometimes have a feeling of great dread at sending him away to school and yet I do feel that the strict discipline may be just the thing . He was glad to get back to us again but he misses his sport at Osterville-There are no tennis courts here but poor grass ones-he said if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The matter of Prescott 's departure was finally cleared up when Samuel telegrammed Flora that the much-maligned Mrs. Dods had indeed written to explain herself . Samuel forwarded the letter from Ohio , and Flora was almost comforted to learn that Mrs. Dods had taken ill in New Jersey . " It was the only excuse I could possibly have accepted , " she wrote . " Her letter was as satisfactory as anything could be + while I do not justify the haste I at least can appreciate her anxiety to get rid of the young company-as summer cottages are not the quiet hospitals one needs in case of illness . " // A few days later , Prescott received his golf clubs . And Samuel must have been somewhat reassured to receive a letter from his seventy-nine-year-old mother extolling the teenager , if not without reservation : // I was much impressed with Prescott 's appearance and manner as he jumped out of the carriage + came to speak to me-he is a handsome boy + a well developed figure for illegible growth . I trust the time will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the pernicious habit of fooling . If I had not seen its results in Aunt Virginia 's family perhaps it would not seem to be so fraught with danger , but with you and Flora to guard him and the uniform discipline of a school he will doubtless find its disadvantages himself . It makes friends with the boys but antagonizes the teachers as I also know by personal experience but little can be done except ... protect him until he is wise enough to check it . // Grandmother Bush was more perceptive than perhaps even she could have realized . Her grandson 's " pernicious habit of fooling " was something that would remain with him for years . At times , the result would be humorous ; at other times , there would be serious repercussions . // Prescott could simply not be suppressed . He possessed all the precocious gifts of a firstborn son who was indulged and adored by his parents . He had inherited humor , dramatic flair , and sociability from his mother , while he exhibited his father 's height , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " splendid boy " was not lost on Flora . " I have had one new experience , " she wrote to her husband , " and that is the devotion of girls 18 or 19 years old to Prescott . He is having a charming time dancing with them + going swimming + indeed walking or running . Prescott + one or two boys a little older are all the boys there are + you may imagine their popularity . I shall be glad to have him away from the girls . He is very kind to me + indeed to us all-but-of course , being in such demand for any length of time might turn his head . " // Even his grandmother 's efforts could not rein him in , and she was someone to be reckoned with . Already widowed for nineteen years when she wrote the note analyzing Prescott , Harriet Fay Bush was born in Savannah , Georgia , of illustrious ancestors who fertilized the family tree with connections to British royalty . On occasion Mrs. Bush could be as starchy as Queen Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly woman 's frailty . " I wonder how she keeps up at all , " Flora wrote . " She has had so many wretched days + people tire and annoy her so very much that I have felt a number of times that it was almost too much for her . " // Flora need not have worried . Behind that swansdown fan fluttered a steel magnolia who would outlast most of her relatives , including her daughter-in-law . As sturdy as the kudzu of Georgia , Harriet Fay Bush would live to be ninety-four years old . // During the summer of 1908 , the Bushes were completing a two-and-a-half-story colonial-style seventeen-room home on Roxbury Road overlooking the bluff of Marble Cliff in Columbus , Ohio . They had purchased the 2.7-acre site for $12,500 the year before , and their letters were filled with details of the seven-bayed windows , five dormered bedrooms , upstairs ballroom , cedar-lined storage room , and awninged porch atop the first-floor sunroom. // " I still remember that house , and I 'm ninety-five now , " recalled Indiana Earl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Bush to live there because he was extremely wealthy and viewed with enormous respect in the community . The Bushes ' big white house sat at the top of a hill looking down on a marble quarry across the street from Sylvio Casparis 's castle ... Mr. Bush was well-to-do wealthy but not as really rich as old Mr. Casparis , who owned the Marble Cliff Quarries. " // As the daughter of a prominent dry-goods merchant , Flora understood how to run a fine home and was delighted when her husband , the president of the Buckeye Steel Castings Company as well as one of the founders of the Scioto Country Club of Columbus , bought land in Grandview Heights near where her brothers and sisters were building their large homes . Flora oversaw the architectural plans for the new house and attended to the details of paying various merchants . " This bill of Sargents is a terror , " she wrote . " Certainly changing those panes is pretty expensive . " Her letters brimmed with eagerness to see the construction completed in time for her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be together and be so very happy , " she put in one of her notes . // In an era before such modern conveniences as washing machines and dryers , Flora expressed concern for a satisfactory cellar that would be " clean and nice and serve as an excellent drying room for laundry . " She acceded to her husband 's love of flowers and his desire for larger gardens to accommodate more plantings , but insisted on her own way in other areas . " About the fireplace-it must be done , " she wrote . " There is no doubt about it . I am willing to compromise on the red . My only choice has been a suitable brown and if that can not be found I shall certainly never give you cause to regret the red . " // As pleased as Flora was to be at Cape Cod with her children and away from the noisy builders and summer heat of the Midwest , she missed her forty-four-year-old husband , who was known to intimates by his middle name . She began each letter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My Dearest Boy . " Irrepressibly affectionate at the age of thirty-six , she signed off with endearments such as " Adieu , my darling Boy , " " I love you my darling and am thinking of you constantly , " " I love you sweetheart dearly . Do n't get on too well without me , " " Please miss me a little , my dearest . " // Nor was she coy about her desire for the man she called " Bushy . " In one letter she wrote : // I should like to have you down here fore sic a week after every one has gone-+ we should lead an Adam + Eve existence-bathe and roam about-We could have a very happy time near to nature 's heart ... I so seldom see a person I desire for a friend . Of course it is because you + I are so much to each other . We do not need the others-I surely need little dear when I am sure of you-but it is the most vital thing in the world that you stay by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bathing , " especially on the rare days she dared to ditch her petticoats , whalebone collars , and fishnet hose . One day , she said , was absolutely perfect because " we went in without skirts or stockings and the sensation was delightful . " And Flora burbled on about the children 's swimming lessons : " Such progress as they are making is truly delightful . Diving or rather jumping into the water and swimming right off-it is fine-I would give anything to have that love for the water or rather the faith-for I do love it-but to be without fear-there is nothing like it . " // Flora seemed quite ready to leave behind the nineteenth-century discomforts of carriages and embrace the new invention of the automobile . As she wrote to her husband , " There is only one comfortable way to get about and that is in a motor car-such a vastly cleaner mode of travel in this part . " That was the year Henry Ford introduced his Model T , which sold for $850. // Flushed with the good fortune of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a frightening accident one morning : // A baseball flying with terrific force , having been batted 50 or 75 feet away , struck me just over the left eye . I dropped + was dazed but soon came to my senses-Prescott white as a sheet + others helping me up-I was able to walk over + then had applications + things done-but I have had a horrid day-as I am lame everywhere + my poor head feels as though it was not mine . Excepting that it hurts . It is turning a hideous green + blue . I suppose I ought to be brave + not write you but my dear Boy I have to let you know . It takes my breath when I realize how easily I might have been killed or my eye put out or anything . // Days later , she wrote : " My head is getting back to its normal state again , but my eye is a hideous black + blue , but I do not suffer . I ca n't help feeling thankful when I think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osterville , she wrote that she was looking forward to returning to Ohio to see their new home : " I am still giving thanks-just think I might never have seen the bay window had the ball struck half an inch lower . I am very thankful to have gotten off so well . " // By the Cape Cod summer of 1908 , Flora and Samuel had been married fourteen years and had four surviving children . They had endured the death of their second child , Robert Sheldon Bush , in 1900 . He was three and a half years old when he contracted scarlet fever , which he fought for six weeks until his little kidneys gave out . He was cremated and his ashes reposed in the Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , where the Bushes had lived for two years . They never specifically mention that sadness in the correspondence that survives . In one letter Samuel alludes to " hard things to bear " and shows he is grounded in the biblical principle that human beings grow in grace only by overcoming adversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote . " We are and we will be ... but surely we should not care to have our lives easy . There would be no accomplishment , no development . We must meet the difficult things and by mutual help surmount them . " // Long before women got the vote and feminists looked like troublemakers in lace bonnets , Samuel Bush had accepted his wife as his equal . His letters to her sound as emancipated as those John Adams wrote to Abigail in the eighteenth century : // You speak of the father as the governing power and very lovingly , too , but my idea is that while the father may be the governing power in some things , the mother is quite as much so in other things and that the power is a dual one and so intended by its creator and it has always been my desire to so have it and so I wish to have you on equal terms and then by mutual consideration have our marriage and love complete and fruitful of the best . // These letters , saved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership between parents who loved their children abundantly and cared for their welfare , although , truth to tell , they write more of their two sons , Prescott and James , than of their two daughters , Mary and Margaret . In her letters , Flora jumps off the page in vivid color as she whirls among her various roles of caring daughter-in-law , nurturing mother , solicitous wife , and robust lover . // With her summer coming to a close , Flora made arrangements for the family to return to Ohio by train , the most comfortable means of travel in those days . " I have applied for sleeping car accomodations so that we will surely get berths ... and have one Drawing Room . " // She told her husband that their oldest child was more than ready to leave Douglas Elementary School in Columbus and start the all-boys preparatory school of St. George 's in Newport , Rhode Island : // Prescott is quite a beaux sic and I shall be very well satisfied to have him safely under Mr. Diman 's care-the strict discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must be sure to arrange to go on with Prescott about the 20th as it is most necessary that you see his surroundings , meet the masters + feel satisfied about the whole . //
