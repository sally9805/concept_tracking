<p> First came the video rental store that cut out the naughty bits . Now , you can get your own DVD player to do it for you ! At what point does someone just watch the entire film and judge it for themselves ? I know it 's hard because they might actually have to think through their own censorship opinions . <p> Patrick J. Doody , Hollywood <p> You are obviously referring to ClearPlay , a DVD player that censors video discs while you 're watching them . It works with some 600 DVDs , and the list is growing . You download the filters and use them with a ClearPlay-enabled machine , which skips over parts deemed unsuitable . Michael Medved is quoted on the Web site : " Movie fans who have been worried about excesses in violence , sexuality and language can now enjoy their favorite films with a sense of security and satisfaction . " <p> If they want to quote me , they can use this : Imagine watching " The Passion of the Christ " with an hour skipped because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a 25-minute short subject ! Imagine " Taxi Driver " without most of the dialogue ! <p> My feeling is , either watch the movie or do n't watch it . There are countless films suitable for family viewing . If you subject an R-rated film to the indignity of the ClearPlay approach , you are not experiencing the film 's continuity and editing rhythm , and may miss information essential to understanding it . My additional feeling is , I 'm damned if I 'm going to pay to let some video jockey decide what I can see . <p> Yes , I know , some parents will want it for their children . I would like to meet the parents who want their little ones to see the ClearPlay versions of R-rated movies , so I could ask them : What 's the point ? Why not just rent films appropriate for your kids ? <p> On the other hand , what about parents who WANT their kids to see R-rated films ? Read on to the next item . <p> Q. Not so much a question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter . I 'm a manager at a " chain " theater . I can no longer count on my fingers and toes the number of times that I and my employees have been berated by parents , because we would not sell their under-17 children tickets to " Kill Bill " or " Eurotrip " or " The Punisher " or some other movie that the parents do n't want to " have to watch . " <p> Some parents just do n't care if their kids watch R-rated movies . Some even create their own R-rated dialogue at the theater over the inconvenience of having to buy their children 's tickets and escort them to the auditorium . <p> I realize that the R-card is really just symbolic , because kids without it will still just try to sneak in like they do now . It will , however , give that theater 's employees an alternative to give to some of their unhappy customers . <p> Name withheld , Oregon <p> A. I got a lot of mail from readers unhappy with my comments about the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois is introducing . Parents can sign a form authorizing their under-17 children to see R-rated movies , and then the kids are issued an ID with their photo on it . " The worst idea I 've ever heard , " ratings czar Jack Valenti told me . <p> " Is n't the R-card the same as what Blockbuster and Hollywood video do ? " asks Christopher Roberts of Dayton , Ohio . " When you have your children put on your card , you can approve them to see anything they want or exclude them from R-rated rentals . Certain R-rated movies should be seen by teens ( " Blue Car , " for example ) . The R rating seems almost arbitrary anyway , since the MPAA does n't have a usable adults-only rating and any kid can purchase a PG-13 ticket and walk into an R-rated movie . " <p> And Jeffrey Perkins of Chicago writes : " I am the father of a very mature 16-year-old , and there are plenty of R-rated movies that I think he should be permitted to see , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the ones he desires to view . The R-card is a great way for us to be able to parent our kids without the oppressive rules of the MPAA . " <p> Q. In your review of " Godsend , " you noted that the director " shot at least seven alternate endings to the movie . " Admittedly , some films can only be helped by a different ending or , in some cases , a different script , but when I hear about a movie with SEVEN alternate endings , it sounds wishy-washy . <p> Who is the director trying to please : himself , me , or the test audience ? Imagine if movies like " Requiem for a Dream , " " Wages of Fear " or " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " had been altered because audiences ( or worse , executives ) thought their endings were too downbeat ! Why not shoot alternate versions of the beginning and the middle while you 're at it ? <p> Miguel E. Rodriguez , <p> Tampa , Fla . <p> A. I quoted fellow critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot at least seven alternate endings , including those in which two different characters are killed two different ways , and little Adam kills everybody . My fervent hope is that all of these endings are included in the bells and whistles on the DVD version . Studios do sometimes change endings on the basis of test audiences , and many good directors have said they learn a lot from test screenings . But often test audiences do not represent the target audience for a given movie , and their input is uninformed or irrelevant . At some point the director has to decide what he really believes in . <p> Q. Someone asked you why you gave away The Bride 's real name in your review of " Kill Bill Vol. 2 . " You replied , " I do n't know what came over me . " I am wondering : Why did Tarantino bleep her name in the first place ? <p> Reint Schoelvinck , Amsterdam <p> A. I thought it was entirely a stylistic device , and that there was no need to suppress it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrecy and suppression . Then , in the second movie , we got that aha moment when the name is revealed . Pretty cool , kiddo . <p> Q. Let me just add my voice to any others over one piddling little detail in your review of " Intermission . " It 's called " Daddy 's Sauce . " not " Dad 's . " And for the record , even though many of us use the term " Daddy 's Sauce " to mean brown sauce in general ( just as all vacuum cleaners are called Hoovers ) , HP is still the better of the two sauces , and it really , really is n't all that bad in coffee . <p> Simon Walker , <p> Austin , Texas <p> A. Since it 's hard to get Daddy 's Sauce and HP Sauce in North America , have you tried A-1 or Heinz Steak Sauce ? How do they taste in coffee ? What about Worcestershire , my favorite ? Louisiana Hot Sauce ? <p> Q. " Kill Bill Vol. 1 , " four stars . " Kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About Eve , " four stars . " Patton , " four stars . Are all four-star movies created equal ? <p> M. Reece , Jacksonville , Fla . <p> A. The star rating system is the bane of my existence . Here 's a message from Jason Eaken of Warrensburg , Mo. , who points out that I gave negative reviews to " The Usual Suspects , " " Fight Club " and " The Ladykillers , " but positive reviews to " The Fast and the Furious , " " Ghosts of Mars , " " Taking Lives " and " High Crimes . " <p> True , I did . But in the reviews I tried to explain how I felt ; just counting stars makes me seem simpleminded . I have always awarded stars in a relative , not an absolute way , based to some degree on a movie 's success in doing what it wants to do , and what the audience expects from it . Of course , if you think stars are limited , you ought to try working with thumbs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss , R. Kenton Nelson . In your review of the film " Something 's Got ta Give " you gave an artist credit for the paintings in the Hampton house . Unfortunately Jack Vettriano is not the master of these paintings . R. Kenton Nelson is the master . A retraction would be a step in the right direction . <p> Jeffrey Treloar , <p> Pasadema , Calif . <p> A. Retracted , with apologies .
