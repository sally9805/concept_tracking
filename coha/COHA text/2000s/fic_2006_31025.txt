May Ted Hammond huffed and puffed as he pedaled up the small hill on the road back into town . Every morning he rode his bike to the junction of Route 92 and County Road 7 and picked up a bundle of the Omaha World-Tribune . And between seven thirty and eight thirty , rain or shine , summer or winter , Ted delivered the news . The newspapers in his canvas shoulder bag felt like they weighed a hundred pounds . That 's because it was Tuesday , and that meant he had an extra bundle of the county paper , the Weekly Observer . But at least there was n't any snow or rain or hot dust blowing into his face . May was Ted 's favorite month for bike riding . Not too hot , not too cold . He loved October , too . But with May , summer was n't far off , and summer meant no school . So May was the best . It was n't like Ted made a lot of money delivering papers , but in Plattsford , Nebraska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its high point in the 1920s , Plattsford had been a small town , not much more than a speck on the Great Plains of west central Nebraska . And for years and years the population had been shrinking . But that did n't bother Ted . He liked the leftovers , the people who were stillaround . And when the Otis family had moved away ? Did n't bother Ted a bit . He had delivered papers to them for two and a half years , and they 'd never given him a tip , not even a dime  --  not even at Christmas . Plus Albert Otis had been a dirty rotten bully . Good riddance . Ted could ride up and down the streets and know who lived in every house  --  well , nearly . He did n't personally know all 108 people who lived in Plattsford , because the whole township covered thirty-six square miles . But the in-town part , the part where he had most of his paper route , that was only about forty houses , and he 'd knocked on almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers . His last stop every day was Clara 's Diner , right on Main Street , and a homemade doughnut and a glass of milk was always waiting for him on the end of the counter . With a last burst of effort , Ted got his bike over the crest of the hill , and then he was coasting down the other side , the early sun bright on his face . Bluebirds singing along the fence row , the waving grass beginning to green up , the faded red paint on the Andersons ' barn  --  Ted pulled it all into his eyes and ears , and then into his heart . He loved this place , his own peaceful corner of the world . And when Ted happened to see a face in an upstairs window of the Andersons ' house , he wanted to smile and wave and shout , " Hey ! Beautiful day , huh ? " But he did n't . And there was a good reason for that . The Andersons had moved away almost two years ago , and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was supposed to be .
