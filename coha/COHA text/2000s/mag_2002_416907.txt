Bathhouses are reigniting the AIDS crisis . It 's time to shut them down . <p> JUDGING FROM THE DESCRIPTIONS I 'VE read and heard , the bathhouse I visited not long ago is fairly typical . Pay $8 to the clerk behind the Plexiglas window and he 'll give you a towel and buzz you in . Inside are hallways of private rooms for sex , each about six by six feet , or just big enough for a thin mattress and a little maneuvering beside it . The rest of the bathhouse is mostly comprised of different areas for men to " cruise "  --  to check out the other bodies and decide which one to bring back to a room . These include a gym ( complete with free weights , Nautilus equipment , and aerobic trainers ) , a sauna , Jacuzzi , and group showers . Elsewhere , gay porn videos play to help men get aroused . For those who like to watch , be watched , or have group sex , there are also orgy areas , including a fantasy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over when receiving anal sex , and " slings " into which men can strap themselves to expose their anus for anyone who happens by . <p> Bathhouses are wholly designed to facilitate anonymous sex  --  sex as a purely physical act , without context , past , or future . But the most anonymous areas of all are the " maze " and the " glory hole " booths . The maze is completely black , a tangle of paths and dead ends defined by vertical sheets of darkly painted plywood where men grope until they find one or more receptive bodies . The booths are paired and separated by plywood through which fist-sized holes have been cut at hip level . Men manage to have not just oral but also anal sex through these holes , guaranteeing that each has n't the slightest idea with whom he is copulating . With the act of sex stripped to its essential physical steps , it is easy  --  and quite common  --  for patrons to have sexual contact with several men in a single visit . <p> Even beyond their physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain clear-cut rules . " Most bathhouse cruising is non-verbal , " advises a bathhouse Web site , which also makes it clear that " most of the time you do n't learn each other 's names " " Conversations in the orgy rooms should be kept to a minimum , " advises another site . Also , " It is considered embarrassing to make it with someone you already know , " and " It is uncommon to use condoms during oral sex . " One bathhouse Web site even has its own Miss Manners , a column called " Ask Towel Boy " in which a veteran gives practical answers to such questions as " Is it a social misdeed to walk around nude all the time ? " and " tow do I refuse someone 's advances without offending them ? " <p> Although they are small in number , bathhouses have an impressive reach . One survey found only about 80 bathhouses and sex dubs in the entire United States . But a recent study of gay men in major cities revealed that nearly one-third had visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys of men who frequent baths confirm what their surroundings encourage : On average , bathhouse patrons have had sex with more than 30 different men in the previous six months . Baths can serve thousands of men per week , and major gay gatherings such as New Orleans ' " Decadence " and Mardi Gras attract men from all over the country . Not surprisingly , this makes them critical hotspots for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV . <p> Bathhouses like the one I visited became infamous for their role in spreading the AIDS virus in the 1980s . The disease raced through gay men in magnet cities like San Francisco , Los Angeles , and New York because it was so easily spread through the dense sexual networks centered in the baths . Many bathhouses were shut down at the time in an effort to contain the epidemic . But while the number of bathhouses is lower now than in the 1980s , most major U.S. cities still have at least one , and the behavior of customers has grown steadily riskier in recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of syphilis among bathhouse clientele . When I was medical director for the HIV and STD program at the Louisiana Office of Public Health , part of my job was to keep an eye open for such outbreaks , since syphilis  --  which causes open sores on the genitalia and makes it easier to transmit disease  --  often presages an outbreak of HIV . If public health officials do n't respond effectively , the current syphilis outbreak could cause HIV to again spread through communities like wildfire . Today , more than two decades alter the start of the AIDS epidemic and 15 years after public health officials and bathhouse owners first clashed over the problem , it is once again time to take a hard look at the evidence and either radically change the way they do business or shut them down altogether . Sex in the City <p> The last time public health officials worried about syphilis outbreaks among gay men was in the late 1970s and early 1980s , when bathhouses were in their prime . Syphilis rates hit a decade-long peak during the unfolding tragedy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French-Canadian flight attendant named Gaetan Dugas was a loyal bathhouse customer . According to Randy Shilts , the reporter who wrote the history of the early AIDS epidemic , And the Band Played On , Dugas was blond , handsome , and ravenous for partners . His job took him to cities throughout North America , where , by his own claim , he had sex with 250 men a year for at least three years . Later , when he became one of the first men diagnosed with the " gay cancer " of Kaposi 's sarcoma , William Darrow , a disease control specialist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , managed to link Dugas to 40 of the first 248 AIDS cases diagnosed in this country in 10 different cities . Although Dugas is infamous for his role in spreading HIV , AIDS researchers believe that if he had n't , many others could have taken his place . This is because of the way gay men were having sex at the time . Bathhouses , which had been small , seedy , and advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960s , flourished to become a central part of urban gay life in the 1970s . Statistics are hard to come by , but one report claims that more than 50 percent of gay men in major cities visited the baths ; 20 percent described their visits as " somewhat " or " very " frequent . <p> Between 1979 and 1984 , with syphilis peaking and bathhouses serving thousands of men a week , HIV tore through the gay population in magnet cities like San Francisco and New York . Reconstructions of the epidemic estimate that close to half of gay men in these cities  --  and between 270,000 and 490,000 nationwide-became infected in just these few years . As gay men , public health officials , and finally the nation began to comprehend the true horror of the AIDS epidemic , a few began to call for the bathhouses to be shut down . San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein first raised the issue with health director Mervyn Silverman in 1982 , but , under pressure from gay groups , Silverman initially balked . By late 1984 , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reports by private detectives outlining the continuing high-risk sex in bathhouses , and a survey showing that 10 percent of gay men in San Francisco were still visiting the baths , Silverman ordered them shut down . The following year , the number of gay men newly infected with HIV declined dramatically . The public closure of San Francisco 's baths is what many people remember of those days , but the story does n't end there . The bathhouses sued the city , and a California Superior Court judge allowed them to reopen , provided they took the doors off the private rooms and booths , so men could be monitored , and hired staff to roam through the baths , kicking out any men engaged in " unsafe sexual practices " <p> The bathhouse closures in San Francisco put political pressure on other AIDS hotspots to do the same . By late 1985 , New York allowed local officials to close establishments in which sex was taking place . New York City mayor Ed Koch declared the rules to be " inadequate " and unenforceable , but nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Los Angeles Board of Supervisors passed regulations in 1986 requiring bathhouse owners to police their establishments and eject anyone engaging in high-risk sex . As stories of bathhouse behavior spread , similar rules were passed in other cities . <p> As the public saw the government respond to the AIDS epidemic and shut down baths and as the HIV epidemic seemed to slow among gay men , however , this vigilance diminished . Battles continued out of the public eye , and many baths managed to stay open or have since reopened , with little oversight from health departments . In San Francisco , the baths were replaced by " sex clubs "  --  essentially bathhouses without enclosed rooms , in keeping with the judge 's order . In New York , four bathhouses never closed . The city began regular inspections , but decided to limit its oversight to sex taking place in plain sight . " We 've demonstrated our concern , " State Health Commissioner David Axelrod told The New York Times in 1987 , adding that he did not " believe it is the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we view the doors of the private rooms the same way . " Likewise , in other cities , the private rooms remained and government officials gave up trying to close them . When government oversight relaxed , not only did the baths remain , but barely a year after the highly publicized closings , their popularity rose once again . By 1987 , business had " gone up 20 to 25 percent , " said the owner of a New York City bathhouse . Violating the " Code " <p> Over the past 15 years , bathhouses have continued to operate mostly out of view of the general public , even though they are widely known to gay men . During the mid-1980s , as gay men watched their friends go from healthy to dead in weeks , the " condom code " took over , and even in the baths condom use became the expected norm . Since then , though , with HIV-fighting drug cocktails keeping HIV-infected men not just alive , but also looking and feeling healthy , the AIDS epidemic has lost the profound emotional impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected men has skyrocketed . Throughout the 1990s gay men increasingly abandoned condoms . As " bare-backing " has become more frequent in the baths , they have again become focal points for the spread of various sexually transmitted diseases . The most convincing ( and alarming ) evidence of this return of risky sexual behavior among gays is the resurgence of syphilis . After a national epidemic related to crack and prostitution in the late 1980s , rates of syphilis had dwindled low enough that in the late 1990s the CDC announced a plan to eradicate the disease altogether . But in 1999 and 2000 , clusters of syphilis in gay men cropped up in several cities where the AIDS epidemic first took off . In New York , Los Angeles , and San Francisco , the number of cases of syphilis in homosexual men approximately doubled every year from 1998 through 2001 , and it looks like they will double again this year . <p> In its primary and secondary stages , syphilis induces raw , oozing genital sores in which the syphilis spirochetes multiply , eager to hitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause breaks in the protective layer of skin , which exposes a person 's blood and immune cells to his partner 's , thus throwing open the door to HIVe . Experts believe that syphilis may increase the probability that HIV transmission will occur in a single sex act by a factor of anywhere from 10 to 50 . While the number of new syphilis cases in gay men may seem small  --  in 2001 there were between 100 and 150 cases each in New York , Los Angeles , and San Francisco  --  the combined total in these cities alone is more than the 251 persons who had been reported to CDC as having AIDS in February 1982 , by which time the CDC had convened a national task force to track the emergency . Perhaps most disturbing , about half of the men infected with syphilis are also infected with HIV  --  a pattern that not only shows how often HIV-positive men are having unprotected sex today , but also all but guarantees that syphilis will have a huge impact on how quickly HIV is spread . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cities that have compiled data on the issue found that infected men like one-time pick-up sex , a practice that ensures that their partner 's name remains as foreign to them as their HIV status . In California , about 25 percent of men with syphilis had had sex in baths or clubs during the time in which they were likely infected ; in Seattle the number was 46 percent . In several cities , the CDC is investigating the baths ' role in the epidemic . And while the results are not yet public , local health officials whom I spoke with in Los Angeles and New York were emphatic that the baths and sex clubs were critically important to the epidemics . <p> To health professionals such as me , syphilis outbreaks in bathhouses are a nightmare . History shows that once syphilis gets rolling , it can quickly reach epidemic proportions . Going by the number of homosexual men acquiring syphilis last year and tine fact that infections are doubling every year , by 2004 there could be 12,000 cases a year  --  enough to qualify as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also come the next wave of HIV : These new syphilis cases could increase the number of gay men newly infected by HIV by thousands per year . The potential of such leaps in the number of HIV infections two decades after we 've learned how to prevent them ought to scare us into action . Risky Business <p> Bathhouses are not just a haven for risky sex ; in many ways they promote it . It is clear that many gay men find anonymous sex appealing , and that as long as there is a place where no-strings-attached sex with strangers is sanctioned , supported , and encouraged , plenty of them will go . But once men arrive at baths for sex , the surroundings can strongly influence how they have it . <p> David McKirnan , a psychologist at the University of Illinois , points out that condom use during sex " is an externally imposed diet that may not require a very powerful external stimulus to break down . " In other words , the fantasy environment and sexual smorgasbord of a bathhouse are more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McKirnan argues that " the physical features of many sexual situations may facilitate cognitive disengagement , e.g. , bars or clubs that are extremely loud , poorly lit , or that present erotic visual stimulation , or sexual settings that stress anonymity . " So the very features of a bathhouse that make it easy to have sex also make it easier to have dangerous sex . <p> The best way  --  and perhaps the only way  --  to prevent a big new epidemic of HIV in gay men is to close these bathhouses for good . Yet , suggest this obvious solution and you will hear a litany of reasons from both gay men and many public health officials about why it ca n't or should n't be done . <p> The most common refrain is that if we close bathhouses , patrons will simply go someplace else for pickup sex , and since other venues are less likely to offer condoms and reminders about safe sex , the men are likely to take even more risks . I do n't buy this argument for several reasons . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sex clubs offer anonymous sex ( " back rooms " of many gay bars , adult bookstores , public bathrooms , or secluded spots in municipal parks , and even temporary bathhouse-like scenes in apartments organized over the Internet ) , the assumption that men deprived of formal bathhouses will necessarily go elsewhere for pick-up sex is suspect . It is what Shilts derided as the " sex maniac " defense of the baths : Any gay man who derives pleasure from the bathhouse orgy scene must be so crazed that he is not influenced by the world around him . <p> There is much evidence to suggest that this is not so . The stories written by bath patrons on Web sites indicate that some  --  perhaps many  --  men visit baths somewhat tentatively , experimenting in havens for anonymous sex . " My friends talked me into some funny stuff to remove my inhibitions on the first time visit , " wrote one , who apparently got very high or very comfortable , because later " I must have sucked about 30 guys through the glory hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious ... One afternoon when my wife was at work and I had the day off ... I got an odd urge to check on the gay scene , thinking it was just a curiosity . " He then described how he was the anal receptive partner for four men in the space of just a few minutes . If these men had been forced to find anonymous partners in public bathrooms or the bushes of a city park , they might have decided to stay home . Daniel Wohlfeiler , an HIV prevention researcher at the University of California at San Francisco , who is as familiar with the baths as any expert , told me he is convinced that if the baths were closed , " a bunch " of men would not go elsewhere . The demand for anonymous sex is " somewhat determined by the supply " of places where men can get it . <p> Second , the argument that bathhouse sex is safer than sex elsewhere is just plain wrong . While bathhouses do n't sell alcohol , many men drink at bars or take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoxication of bath patrons , any intentions to have safe sex are often lost in a fog of drugs . Everyone I spoke to agreed that men in baths virtually never use condoms during oral sex . Even during the far-riskier practice of anal sex , men frequently " bareback . " Twenty-one percent of those surveyed at a Portland bathhouse who had had anal sex did so without a condom . <p> Third , even if men in the baths went elsewhere for sex , it 's unlikely that they would have the same type of sex . Physical and social settings have a great deal of influence on what actually occurs . It is more complicated to have anal sex ( with or without a condom ) in a public restroom or behind a park bush , where sex is rushed for fear of getting caught , than it is in a bathhouse . Consequently , these men are more likely to have oral sex , which is less likely to spread HIV . In a broad survey of behavior in four large cities , 34 percent of bathhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent in other cruising spots . Perhaps even more important , it would be nearly impossible for men to have multiple partners in a single park encounter  --  but in bathhouses , it 's routine . History also argues that closing baths does indeed lower risky behavior . After San Francisco dosed its baths in 1984 , the number of men who had multiple partners or engaged in risky sex plummeted by about 60 percent . <p> But perhaps most important is the epidemiological effect that baths have on spreading sexually transmitted diseases . Most people who acquire STDs do not spread them to others , either because they have only a single sex partner ( who infected them ) during the period in which they 're infectious , or because they use condoms when straying from their partner . Conversely , the relatively few people who change partners very frequently  --  such as bathhouse visitors  --  can infect scores . Experts who develop mathematical models of STD epidemics call these people " core transmitters . " They are , as one writer put it , the people who " keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitter comes into contact with men who are unlikely to spread the disease  --  even a large number of them  --  he will infect many , but wo n't trigger an epidemic . If , on the other hand , a core transmitter has sex with just a few other core transmitters , something akin to a nuclear chain reaction takes place , causing the disease to explode in a population . One need look no further than the example of America 's most famous core transmitter , bathhouse enthusiast Gaetan Dugas . <p> Thus the speed at which HIV travels through a population is determined in large part by who is having sex with whom . The best way to spark an epidemic is to create opportunities for core transmitters to have sex with each other . Bathhouses  --  magnets for core transmitters designed precisely for one-time sex with multiple partners  --  do just that . Power to the People ? <p> When I told several colleagues at a recent national STD meeting that I thought the resurgence of gay men having anonymous sex probably spelled the end of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemic , all agreed . But rather than jump into discussions about how to respond , most seemed to fall into despair . <p> This stems partly from a pervasive feeling of powerlessness . Dr. Peter Kerndt , the director for the STD Program at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services , told me , " If the gay community wo n't protect itself , we ca n't protect them . " I 've heard variations on this sentiment from many public health professionals , but it continues to puzzle me . Clearly , the gay community as a whole is supportive of safe sex , since the majority of men either do n't frequent baths or use condoms when they do . It is unclear to me what the " gay community " can do about the minority of men who continue having high-risk sex . Without an organizing structure , designated leaders , or an enforcement arm , it is they who are powerless . Bathhouses are , after all , for profit businesses that trade in anonymous sex and risk losing money if they stop providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority of customers ; they simply ca n't be trusted to police themselves . <p> Government , on the other hand , is supposed to have the power to prevent a few people or businesses from threatening the broader public health . The despair among government officials like my colleagues sterns from a structure and culture developed during the AIDS epidemic that is based on inclusion and cooperation rather than enforcement . This government culture seems to have grown as a response to AIDS activism in the 1980s , which itself was a response to the lethargy government agencies initially displayed toward this plague of historic proportions . AIDS activism , which embraced such tactics as haranguing experts at scientific meetings , blockading FDA headquarters , and pressuring politicians to cough up public money for prevention and treatment , effectively prodded government agencies into taking steps to curb the epidemic that otherwise might never have happened . But in an era when politicians of all stripes argued that all government was bad , it also made agencies adopt a very defensive posture . To deflect criticism , public health agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were faulty , that all opponents had legitimate positions , and that all interested people ( no matter how self-interested ) should t ) e appeased by including them in decision-making . <p> Public health agencies , operating HIV prevention programs based in large part on grants from the CDC , are required by congressional mandate to spend these funds under the direction of a committee " representing the community " anti co-chaired by a community member . In most cases this means the majority of committee members are gay men , former drug users , and others who work with them , most of whom vigorously protect the right of high-risk people to do what they want to do . As beneficial as this system may be in building mutual trust , it prohibits health departments from taking virtually any action to prevent AIDS that contains even the barest whiff of enforcement . Inclusion can be a good thing in planning public policy  --  but it can also be taken too far , as when it gives people veto power that imperils public health . Imagine if the local health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first securing the permission of restaurant owners . <p> Because of this structure and the culture surrounding it , little enforcement actually occurs in the baths around the country . In San Francisco , health officials inspect sex clubs about twice a month to make sure that safe-sex posters are displayed and condoms are available ; they also write vaguely threatening letters to clubs named by patients with syphilis as permitting unprotected sex . New York takes almost the opposite approach ; the city sends inspectors to gay bars and other sites to make sure customers are not having sex in open areas , and will shut them down if they are ; but it ignores baths where sex takes place behind closed doors . To my knowledge , baths in other cities are unfettered by health inspectors . <p> This lackluster state of enforcement is the final remnant of the bathhouse battles of the 1980s : Elected officials delegated decision-making to the courts , which delegated it to health departments , which educated owners about safe sex and then delegated enforcement to them . Bathhouse owners , in mm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once again started spreading HIV and syphilis . <p> When I suggested to several colleagues at the STD meeting that the baths should be dosed , many ( though not all ) agreed . But even those who agreed seemed to recoil at the idea of actually doing it . The reason is partly the past success of our cooperative approach to HIV prevention . But I ca n't help wondering if a part of the reason is also fear  --  fear of being shouted down at meetings by activists , or of being politically undercut or fired by elected officials , some of whom may receive campaign donations from bathhouse owners and gay advocacy groups . The risks do n't stop there , though . Dr. Jeffrey Klausner , the director of STD Prevention and Control Services in San Francisco , was quoted in a Washington Monthly story last November ( ' " When Rubbers Hit the Road , " by Andrew Webb ) as being in favor of closing sex clubs ; he received repeated death threats , as did his family . During the bathhouse battles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silverman received so many death threats that he started wearing a bulletproof vest . Ban the Baths <p> Most baths do take steps to encourage condom use . They have reminder posters on the walls , and bowls of condoms placed throughout the establishment . Some offer regular HIV testing . But prevention usually stops there . Many baths do not even have signs telling men that sex without condoms is forbidden , much less eject them if rules are violated . Because of the cooperative model for containing AIDS that arose in the 1980s and still reigns , public health agencies are at a tremendous disadvantage : Even those that recognize the danger of bathhouses can only try various modes of persuasion . <p> To prevent the spread of HIV , most agencies fund community-based AIDS service organizations that conduct " outreach to " ( not " inspections of " ) bathhouses , an approach not of enforcement but supplication . As Wohlfeiler put it , public health officials are usually grateful when owners are " magnanimous " enough to let them in the door . This **33;1631;TOOLONG approach seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified of the epidemic adopted condoms pretty faithfully . But the syphilis outbreaks now make it clear that we need a new strategy . With the activists and the courts potentially protecting the status quo in bathhouses , it 's worth considering what steps could be taken short of outright closure . One possibility is for cities nationwide to couple San Francisco 's ban on sex in closed-door rooms with serious enforcement of condom use , so that public health inspectors can catch  --  and stop  --  risky behavior . There is evidence to suggest that a strict enforcement policy could work . Buzz Bense , the owner of a San Francisco sex club called Club Eros , requires customers to read and sign an agreement stipulating that they will follow the rules , which include using condoms . Club goers have sex in open , well-lit rooms , observed by staff members who circulate at regular intervals . Those caught having anal sex without condoms are kicked out ; repeat offenders lose their membership . Bense says that customers accept these rules ( he throws out fewer than five a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer have to negotiate condom use . But to reliably prevent HIV spread , even strict enforcement by club owners would require an additional layer of government enforcement . <p> Until recently , the HIV epidemic seemed to be waning in all major groups : gay men , IV drug users , and high-risk heterosexuals . But the syphilis outbreaks not only tell us that our hopes of eliminating this disease with the next decade are gone , but also confirm predictions that we will see a second wave of HIV infection in gay men . If we want to keep this second wave at bay we must make dramatic changes in how we deal with the baths . Unless we are willing to hire plenty of full-time condom inspectors for the long haul  --  a strategy that history tells us may fail  --  we ought to finish the job we started in the 1980s and close the baths for good . <p> By Tom Farley <p> <p> TOM FARLEY is a professor at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine . <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
