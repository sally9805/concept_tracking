Two years ago , it looked as though the movie world was about to knock Michelle Rodriguez out of the ring . The would-be actress was living with her mom in Jersey City , N.J. , and laboring as an extra in movies like Summer of Sam ; the thankless , anonymous work was wearing her out . Then she saw an ad in Back Stage for a Latina actress to portray a boxer in a new film . Rodriguez did n't box and had never auditioned for a speaking role in a movie before , but the ad intrigued her . " I thought , If I 'm going to quit , I might as well give it a shot before I quit , " Rodriguez says . " If you do n't play the lottery , you 'll never win . " <P> Looks as if we have a winner . Beating out more than 300 other women , Rodriguez , 22 , won the lead in Girlfight , an independent film about a female boxer 's athletic and romantic struggles . Girlfight 's budget was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a big-time impact : it won a prize for directing and shared an award for best drama at this year 's Sundance Film Festival . And Rodriguez 's no-punches-pulled performance has critics sputtering superlatives like Don King hyping a pay-per-view fight . To prepare for the role , Rodriguez trained for 4 1/2 months , five or six days a week . " I like taking my body to its limits , " she says . " It 's a beautiful thing to do . " <P> In person Rodriguez looks more like a Maxim cover girl than a pugilist ( she has dropped 10 lbs . since Girlfight wrapped ) . But when she speaks , she talks tough , skipping the float-like-a-butterfly thing and going right for the bee sting . How is she finding Hollywood so far ? " I 've met a lot of hypocrites . " How did she approach her part ? " I pretended it was a rap song , and I would recite my lines and recite them until I got the rhythm of it . " Whom does she admire ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She kicks ass , like , whassup ! " <P> Rodriguez 's father ( now deceased ) hailed from Puerto Rico , and her mother is from the Dominican Republic . She was raised in both places and in Texas and New Jersey to boot . She dropped out of high school in ninth grade but later got a G.E.D. Her decision to go into acting came after one of her two older brothers told her to get a job . " I do n't like working at anything I do n't like to do , " she says . " I figured , Why not become an actress so I can see what it 's all about and meet people ? " <P> Since Girlfight , Rodriguez has signed on to play a cabbie in the drama 3 am ( co-starring Danny Glover ) and a car racer 's girlfriend in the movie Redline ( with Vin Diesel ) . She 's getting plenty of offers , but she is searching for meaningful roles . " Screenwriters keep going at it with the same fantasy formula , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasies of these old white men . It 's all about satisfying their egos , and I see it through the work . And it 's tiring . It makes movies predictable . " <P> Girlfight director Karyn Kusama says Rodriguez has " tremendous presence ... she 's interesting to watch even when she 's standing still . " The director also believes her star may be too complex , too edgy , too real for mainstream filmmaking 's limitations . " Hollywood is probably in many respects not the place for her , as far as I 'm concerned , " says Kusama . " She could be a huge star . She should be . But she can never just be the rote girlfriend . I hope she 'll find more roles than just that . But there are a lot of girlfriend roles out there . "
