What 's harder than building career momentum ? Jumping right to the top . Josh Duhamel prepares you for liftoff <p> IT 'S EASY TO DISCOUNT JOSH DUHAMEL . You see the tall , lean frame , the rugged mug , the superstar babe on his arm , and you think , Dude 's got it so easy . But toss back a brew with the guy and you 'll find that he 's no Hollywood himbo  --  just a regular joe with a hardworking streak as wide as the Santa Monica freeway . <p> Remember Duhamel back in 2004 ? No ? Well , we 're willing to bet that your wife or girlfriend probably does : As the eponymous lust object in the beefcake chick flick Win a Date with Tad Hamilton ! Duhamel grinned his way into the spotlight , chopping wood sans shirt and outshining his romantic foil , Topher Grace  --  the putative everyman . <p> But here 's the thing : Somehow , after the curtain dropped on Tad Hamilton , Duhamel , 34 , found a way to slough off that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy we 'd all want to have a beer with , if just to sneak a peek at his playbook . Take his new film , the savage thriller Turistas , which opens this month . A chick flick it 's not : Duhamel told us that a writer from Ells magazine walked out of a screening because it was too intense . ( In our book that makes any film a must-see . ) Next up ? A megabudget Transformers adaptation with producer Michael Bay . And then there 's that regular TV gig on the show Las Vegas in which Duhamel is the Cool Hand Luke of the crew amidst all the sex and sin . <p> Offscreen , he 's managed to land one of the hottest and coolest women out there  --  Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas  --  not just for a couple of dates , but a couple of years . Basically , Duhamel has assembled what everyone is striving for : career success , a great relationship , and a skull screwed on just tight enough to keep it all together . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it together , " he says , laughing . " But I definitely have my moments . " <p> Sure , Duhamel makes it look easy . But he has a few tricks up his sleeve that have stoked his success , and his life  --  tricks that any regular guy can adopt . Heck , maybe you can make it look even easier . FIND YOUR FUEL <p> Every man needs a motivation , and Duhamel was lucky to find his early , in school . And feel free to call it what it is : spite . " There were a couple of moments in high school and college that really fueled me to come out to L.A. and prove to people that I could do it , " he says . " It had to do with different coaches who did n't believe in me . I felt like I was n't getting the respect or the shot that I deserved , especially in college . I look back on it now and it 's something that I 'm happy did n't work out , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire that I had to get that I did n't have . If that 's a good reason or not , I 'm not sure , but it helped me . It helps me to this day . " SAY YES FIRST , ASK QUESTIONS LATER <p> There 's inherent danger in this piece of advice . Heed it , and you could fall , and fall hard . But when a higher authority opens the door a crack , cranes his neck around the doorjamb , and asks you if you can do something you 've always wanted to do , just tell him , " Damn straight I can do it , " even if you have no idea . It 's like that itinerant organist who ended up laying down the classic track on Dylan 's " Like a Rolling Stone . " You could make history . That 's because taking a dangerous chance ups your game , says Duhamel . " I 'd been auditioning for TV commercials and some modeling , " he recalls , " and an agency in L.A. asked if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course ! ' But I did n't have the respect I needed for it at the beginning , and after a couple of really bad auditions , I busted my ass for a couple of years just to get past the audition process . Over the past 7 years , it 's become an obsession , something I really love . " ALWAYS , ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR GODFATHER <p> You know you 've made it in show business when you can refer to a guy like James Caan as " Jimmy . " Duhamel has worked with the hard-nosed actor-he played Sonny Corleone in The Godfather  --  on Las Vegas for three-plus seasons now and lists him as one of his most important friends and mentors . The consummate tough guy delivered Duhamel some advice early on that he turned into a veritable mantra . " Jimmy told me , ' No matter how successful you become , everything can not be about the work . You have to have a foundation , you have to have a strong relationship with your family and friends and the people you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how far you go professionally , at some point there 's going to be a downtrend , and what defines you as a man is your loved ones . ' " Duhamel 's not hurting for his support group : When we first spoke , he 'd just returned from a sister 's wedding ( he has three , all younger ) in his hometown in North Dakota . PICK THE RIGHT GIRL <p> We chase women because we want them . No surprise there . Their character traits , however , do n't always hold as much sway ( or , ahem , jiggle ) as their physical ones . But moxie is the only real quality that matters when you 're trying to balance career and relationship  --  the downfall of many a passionate , committed romance . Duhamel claims character is the main reason his run with Fergie is " the best relationship I 've ever had . We have very similar upbringings and a similar work ethic , so there 's never any animosity or competitiveness between us . Even when she 's touring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're really good about communicating . It works . " It 's the old **26;2543;TOOLONG trap , and when you find a top-notch girl willing to work with you , prepare to grow old happily . TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AGING <p> Mother Nature chills you out for a reason . Duhamel just turned 34 , which is hardly ancient , but it ai n't 24 , either . He considers two fistfuls of birthday candles a huge advantage in the battle for prosperity . And the earlier a guy figures this out , the better off he is . " These days I see more of a path toward what I want to do , " he says , " and what I feel like I 'm capable of doing . I know what it takes now to accomplish my goals . That 's the biggest thing . " Then he pauses and laughs . " And I appreciate downtime . Man , I really appreciate having a weekend to hang . " LEAD YOURSELF NOT INTO TEMPTATION <p> Simple geography : If you do n't want to cheat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose your shirt at the Bellagio craps table , keep your distance . Just being in reach of temptation can cause all sorts of trouble . Duhamel was photographed with actress Megan Fox ( one of his Transformers costars ) in a Vegas casino , and next thing you know , a tabloid said he spent the night with her . Which is why he hardly ever goes to that city anymore . " It 's decadent  --  you get there , you ca n't drink enough , you ca n't have enough fun  --  and it 's not worth it . It 's not worth putting yourself in that situation . No matter how loyal you try to be , or how respectful you try to be , people will target you . It does n't matter how well you 're behaving . People will make it look as salacious as possible . " Remember that this holiday season before your naked derriere descends on the copier . MAKE YOUR OWN BREAKS <p> Here 's how Josh Duhamel stole the spotlight  --  and how you can Land a Leading rote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It does n't matter if your first job is a nonspeaking rote . Seek out recognition within your industry , not just your office . Volunteer to line up speakers or man the sign-in table at professional events , suggests psychologist Paul Powers , Ph.D. , author of Love Your Job . You 'll rub shoulders with potential future employers , pitching yourself as a big-picture kind of guy who sees beyond his current gig . BORROW SOMEONE 'S SCRIPT <p> Duhamel considers actor James Caan a key mentor . But for every one of Caan 's Godfather blockbusters , there 's a Rolterball dud . The message here : Milk your mentor for his or her pitfalls , not just successes . " The best way to learn from mistakes is to have other people make them for you , " says Powers . Ask , " What skills do you wish you 'd polished earlier on ? " instead of fawning , " How can T become you ? " CREATE STARRING ROLES <p> Following the box-office bomb Win a Date with Tad Hamilton ! with another teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're stuck in admin with an eye on the executive ranks , create your own auditions . " Ask the boss if you can form your own task force to solve a shortcoming you 've noticed around the office , " says Marie McIntyre , Ph.D. , author of Secrets to Winning at Office Politics . COMMAND EVERY STAGE , SMALL OR BIG <p> Tod Hamilton ! might not have set Hollywood on fire , but Duhamel made the most of his marquee moment and showed he was more than just a set of dimples . It 's that old career chestnut : " You want a big title and bigger responsibility , even if it 's in a smatter pond , " McIntyre says . " It 's easier for an employer to trust you in a Leading rote if you 've already shown you can hack it . " DENNY WATKINS <p> STOP SIN BEFORE IT BEGINS <p> Temptation is a tug-of-war between the primitive and high-level parts of your brain , says Daniel Amen , M.D. , a psychiatrist and the author of Making a Good Brain Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compelling you to putt that slot handle or succumb to a Lap dance . That 's unless the brainy prefrontal cortex tugs you away . Three ways you can avoid being beguiled : THE CRAPS TABLE <p> Duhamel knows the real secret here : Avoid the casino . " People underestimate the importance of setting up their environment to favor self-control , " says Roger Giner-Sorolla , Ph.D. , a psychology professor at the University of Kent at Canterbury , Instead of hitting the casino , set up a tow-stakes basement poker game with your buddies . Ante with high-risk , low-loss dares ( loser has to race in the local triathlon in a pink Speedo ) or household chores ( low man mows the winner 's lawn ) to keep serious cash off the table . JUNK FOODS <p> There 's a reason pints of Ben &; Jerry 's do n't survive many midnight fridge raids . " At bedtime , people want to feet relaxed , and comfort foods are usually high in sugar or fat , which release opiates to boost our mood , " says Collin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cornell University 's food and brain lab . " Problem is , that only causes us to binge . " Want a safer snack ? Try a smart portion of low-fat yogurt with some almonds , some cheese with a wholegrain cracker , or a cup of fruit . THAT LAST DRINK <p> Many of life 's greatest mistakes are made just after last call , so plan ahead . Visualize ordering that last send-off libation about an hour before closing time ( and withstanding the arm twisting from your buddies when you demur on the next round ) . It sounds obvious , but " the more vividly you can picture yourself saying no , the better you 'll be able to stave off your cravings and the social pressure to keep drinking , " says Giner-Sorolla .
