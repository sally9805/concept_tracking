<p> A girl with a newborn she did n't want phoned a hospital in Mobile , Ala. , on the day before Christmas . She had heard that the hospital took babies ; what should she do ? <p> Bring it in , replied Terri Little , emergency room supervisor at Springhill Hospital . <p> I do n't have to sign any papers ? the girl asked . No , Little recalls telling her . Just bring it in . <p> Springhill is part of a national movement to solve a disturbing problem with a less disturbing solution : Encourage mothers who want to abandon their babies to drop them off at a hospital instead of throwing them in the trash . <p> A few hours later , a teenager in jeans carrying a boy wrapped in a white blanket came into the ER . No diaper bag , no purse . She walked to the counter where Little was sitting and nonchalantly handed over the boy " like he was a bag of groceries , " Little thought . <p> Did she have any medical information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl said . She turned and walked out through the double doors . She did n't look back . <p> Her son still had his umbilical cord . To Little , he looked " healthy as a horse and cute as a button . " <p> It was less than 12 hours to Christmas . The nurses named him Nick . <p> " It 's sad , but this is how the program is supposed to work , " Little says today . " I do n't want to read about any more babies thrown in the trash . " <p> Trash-can babies are a problem that Americans literally ca n't ignore . <p> In the first month of this year , a couple in Paterson , N.J. , spotted something in a pile of debris along the railroad tracks that looked like a doll . A Denver supermarket clerk saw something moving on a shelf behind the disposable diapers . A boy in Minneapolis heard cries from the bathroom and later saw his sister go outside with a garbage bag and dump it , oddly , in the neighbors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least eight others last month  --  a baby had been left to die , or perhaps to catch the eye of a stranger . <p> Each year , hundreds of young women secretly bring babies to term  --  fooling relatives , friends and sometimes even themselves  - -  only to bury them in shallow graves , throw them in trash bins , leave them in alleys or woods or , in one infamous case in New Jersey two years ago , a restroom at the senior prom . <p> In the past 12 months their bodies have been discovered in the Mississippi River , in a trash bin behind a Texas high school , in a field in Richmond , Calif. , in a gas station rest room in Los Angeles . It 's a crime that smacks everyone in the face . In greater Houston , where 13 babies were abandoned in a 10-month period ending in September , billboards plead , " Do n't Abandon Your Baby ! " <p> On Long Island , a paramedic started a group that " adopts " infants who have been abandoned and died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hope "  --  and a funeral . In southern California , a housewife claims the bodies at the morgue . Her father builds small caskets and volunteers knit blankets for each tiny body . Then the woman lovingly buries them in a private cemetery plot she calls " The Garden of Angels . " <p> A surprising number of discarded babies survive , despite being sealed in plastic or left out in freezing cold . In the past year they have been found alive in a flower bed outside a Houston hospital , on a front porch in Galveston , under a bush near a school in Sunnyvale , Calif. , and under a tree in Kiwanis Park in Rahway , N.J. In greater Pittsburgh , hundreds of families have put baskets out on their porches for unwanted babies ; so far , none has been dropped off . <p> No one knows how many babies are thrown away or abandoned , or even how many cases are reported . A computer search of major daily newspapers found 65 reports of discarded newborns in 1991 , and 105 in 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> States stepping in <p> The number of babies thrown away or abandoned in public is relatively small . But it 's so shocking that localities in several states have made it easier and safer for mothers who want to abandon their newborns to do so . Although programs vary , most promise that if the mother drops off her infant at a hospital or similar facility , she 'll face little or no risk of prosecution if the baby is unharmed , and few or no questions . <p> Local programs have been started in Alabama , Texas , Minnesota and Florida , and legislation has been or is to be proposed in California , Kentucky and several other states . Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee is drafting legislation to keep federal statistics on the problem . <p> The movement to save newborns by making it easier for their mothers to give them up started two years ago in Mobile , when a young television reporter named Jodi Brooks decided she had seen too many stories about discarded babies . <p> In most places , authorities try to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her unwanted baby at a hospital can expect some pointed questions and a call to the police ( although criminal charges are unlikely ) . <p> To change this , Brooks brought together the local prosecutor , social service agencies and hospitals . The result was a heavily publicized program called " A Secret Safe Place for Newborns . " The baby must be brought in within 72 hours of birth to a designated hospital , where everyone down to the groundskeeper is supposed to be ready to accept a baby . A mother has six months to reclaim her child if she changes her mind . <p> Since the Mobile program began in November 1998 , only one infant has been discarded that authorities know of , a baby who was found alive in the woods . Four babies have been turned in ; two were later reclaimed by their mothers and the others are in foster homes , including the Christmas baby named Nick . <p> But the program has critics . " I 'm not for anything that makes abandonment easier , " says Judy Hay of Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want questions asked , so the child wo n't wonder some day , ' What 's my medical background ? Am I at risk for sickle cell ? For breast cancer ? ' You 're condemning someone to the lifelong question ' Who am I ? ' " <p> In the case of Nick , Terry Little got nothing out of the mother , not even when he was born . " It 's Catch-22  --  get information without asking too many questions , " Little says resignedly . " You do n't want to spook ' em . " <p> ' Something to get rid of ' <p> Will a young mother who is isolated , scared , and possibly in denial of her pregnancy  --  in such denial that she neither has an abortion nor makes plans to formally hand the baby over for adoption  - -  come to a well-patrolled , camera-scanned emergency room ? <p> After talking to several girls who abandoned their babies , " I 've gained new respect for the power of denial , " Judy Hay says . " To them , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to get rid of . " And perhaps not even worth a trip to the hospital . <p> The Safe Place approach also is opposed by an organization called Project Cuddle , which has a national hotline ( 1-888-628-3353 ) and volunteer network . In the past three years , it has counseled 190 girls who , it claims , might have otherwise abandoned their babies . <p> " These girls do n't want anything to do with the system , including a hospital , " Project Cuddle 's Laurie Larson says . " They want a connection with a person who will help them , and we give them that . " She notes that three of the 13 Houston-area babies were abandoned after a state law took effect that gave legal protection to mothers who turn unwanted babies over to medical personnel . <p> Michael McGee , education director for Planned Parenthood , says the real problem is a society that sends powerful but mixed messages : Sex is glorious , sex is shameful . The result is pregnant teens who ca n't even acknowledge that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help some girls , " but it 's a Band-Aid after the fact . " <p> An unexpected pregnancy <p> Tywana Davis knows how it feels to be young , pregnant and scared . <p> She was a high school senior in Columbus , Ohio , living with her grandparents . If they found out , she told herself , they 'd make her go back to her mother  --  to a home that often had no heat , no electricity and no food . Just drugs . <p> So she said nothing , started wearing baggy clothes and hoped she 'd miscarry . She had n't by graduation , nor by the time she went off to Ohio Dominican College . Finally , on the day before Thanksgiving , on a comforter on the floor of her dormitory room , she gave birth to a girl . <p> " I thought , ' What can I do ? How can I bring this baby home to my grandparents ? ' The only thing I could think to do was to get rid of her . " <p> She wrapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a plastic grocery bag and carried her down three flights of stairs . She stepped out into the cold November night , walked to a trash bin in back of the dorm and laid her baby inside . <p> But when the girl got back to her room , she realized she could n't just leave the baby down there . So she used a pay phone in the hall to call campus security with an anonymous report : Something was making noise in back of the dorm . <p> She watched from her window as an officer arrived and found herbaby . Then she lay down and waited for her ride home for Thanksgiving . <p> Investigators checked a list of students who had not left the dorm . They came to her grandparents ' door on Thanksgiving . <p> Tywana Davis pleaded guilty to child endangerment and was sentenced to a year 's house arrest . But her grandparents stood behind her , and raised the child while their granddaughter finished college . <p> Today Davis is 23 , with a job in marketing and custody of 4-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their voices the fear , panic and ignorance that once crippled her . <p> Can the Safe Place approach penetrate the consciousness of girls who wo n't even face the fact that they 're pregnant ? <p> Yes , she says , " but you got to spread the word . Otherwise , forget it . These girls are in their own world .
