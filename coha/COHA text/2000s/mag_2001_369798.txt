Heraclitus , the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived and wrote 2,500 years ago  --  around the same time as Confucius , Lao Tzu and the Buddha  --  is best known as the man who said you can not put your foot into the same river twice . <P> Here is how the poet Brooks Haxton , in his fine new translation of Heraclitus , Fragments , the Collected Wisdom of Heraclitus ( Viking ; 99 pages ; $19.95 ) , puts the thought : " The river/where you set/your foot just now/is gone  --  /those waters/ giving way to this , /now this . " <P> Such fragments are all that is left of Heraclitus ' great book , On Nature , which was lost many centuries ago . They come to us with a scattered , enigmatic quality  --  epigrams and bits of poetry saved from the ruins . But they also have a wit and , for someone known as an obscure philosopher , a prismatic clarity that travels well across centuries . The thoughts remain fresh and profound . Haxton 's translation shines them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man/sounds apish . Beauty/in a human face/looks apish too. /In everything/we have attained/the excellence of apes . " <P> Heraclitus was of the royal blood that ruled the Greek city of Ephesus , but renounced his heritage . He looked on his fellow Ephesians with a certain aristocratic disdain and hated the mediocrity of those who " eat their way/toward sleep like nameless oxen . " His countrymen , he wrote , " say , No man should be/worthier than average . Thus , /my fellow citizens declare , /whoever would seek/excellence can find it/elsewhere among others . " He was sardonically hardheaded : " Hungry livestock , /though in sight of pasture , /need the prod . " <P> It 's bracing to come upon an intelligent elitist long , long dead , especially when we live in an Ephesus of our own , filled , as his was , with mediocrities and idiot intoxications . Haxton writes in his introduction : " To a sober mind , the drunkenness of cultic worshippers must have been particularly unappealing in a cosmopolitan city like Ephesus , with gods of wine on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dionysus running amok with drunken Phrygians worshipping Sabazius , Lydians possessed by Bassareus , and Cretans in the frenzy of Zagreus , all claiming in their cups to have transcended understanding . " <P> The Fragments speak in an eerily contemporary voice . Heraclitus anticipated Einstein 's theory that energy is the essence of matter : " All things change to fire , /and fire exhausted/falls back into things . " The metaphor of Heraclitean fire posits an absolutely unstable world , in constant flux , consuming and creating , the alternation and reconciliation of day and night , waking and sleeping , life and death , wet and dry , good and evil . " What was cold soon warms , /and warmth soon cools. /So moisture dries , /and dry things drown . " And " The earth is melted/into the sea/by that same reckoning/whereby the sea/ sinks into the earth . " <P> Here is the ultimate economy : " As all things change to fire , /and fire exhausted/falls back into things , /the crops are sold/ for money spent on food . " <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived the fire . <P>  --  By Lance Morrow
