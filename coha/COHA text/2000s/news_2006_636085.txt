<p> CINCINNATI  --  It did n't take long for the White Sox to find out that all the hype and all the stories surrounding the Great American Ball Park being a hitter 's paradise were nothing short of the truth . <p> " Great background , great batter 's box , gaps play short , " Paul Konerko said , sounding part Sox first baseman/part tour guide . <p> Good thing for the Sox that it did n't take Freddy Garcia very long to get over all that hype . <p> Behind a 16-hit performance by his offense , Garcia overcame a shaky start to throw eight innings in the 12-4 win over Cincinnati on Friday . <p> And while Garcia ( 8-4 ) felt it was one of his better performances in the last month , the thought of having to face the Reds in this ballpark again brought a quick reply from the right-hander . <p> " I do n't really ever want to pitch here again , " Garcia said . " I threw two high fastballs and both were gone . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a living . <p> In allowing four runs on seven hits in the start , he also helped the Sox ( 42-25 ) stay within 1oe games of first-place Detroit in the American League Central Division , after the Tigers took care of the Cubs . <p> " This is not an easy ballpark to pitch in , and we saw that , " Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said . <p> Unfortunately for the Reds ( 37-30 ) , so did they . <p> The Sox sent the message very early on , as Jermaine Dye 's first-inning walk loaded the bases for Joe Crede . The third baseman took an 0-1 offering from Cincinnati starter Brandon Claussen and deposited it in the left-field stands down the line for his third career grand slam and a quick 4-0 lead . <p> " Watching the Reds hit in batting practice and then watching our guys hit , you can tell that the park played small , " Crede said . " I 'll take it . " <p> While a four-run lead is usually a pitcher 's dream , this ballpark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garcia let Cincinnati right back into the game in the bottom of the first , serving up a three-run homer to Rich Aurilia . After Aurilia made it a one-run game , however , Garcia seemed to take over with that one bad pitch out of his system , retiring 12 straight at one point . <p> " That 's been Freddy 's issue , " Guillen said of Garcia 's bad start . " He drives you crazy for a couple of minutes , then he turns it up a notch . He 's a competitor . I was so happy with what he did Friday , especially after his last start in a loss to Cleveland was so rough . " <p> Claussen found out exactly what a rough start looked like , as the Sox did not let up on the left-hander . <p> With that one-run lead , Scott Podsednik added an RBI single in the second , followed by a Konerko RBI double . In the third it was three singles to start the inning , before Claussen ( 3-8 ) was pulled . The southpaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hits . <p> It was Podsednik who once again highlighted that outpouring in the third , scoring two more runs with his single . <p> Things were so good for the Sox offense that even Garcia picked up a single in the game . <p> " American League pitchers should do well against the National League , " Guillen said . " The lineups are a little easier with a pitcher in there , and I think the guys get pumped up a bit to come over and play the other league . " <p> The only other mistake Garcia made in the win came in the seventh inning when another high fastball was sent packing , as Austin Kearns connected on his 13th home run of the year . <p> " After I gave up those three to them , I shut it down , " Garcia said . " I made my pitches when I needed to . That 's the way I should pitch . Throw my slider , change speeds . The last three or four starts I 've tried to throw hard , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another interleague win , Garcia improved his career mark against the NL to 17-6 . <p> While Garcia is glad he is done pitching in Cincinnati 's version of a launching pad , Sox hitters could n't help but be excited about the rest of the weekend . <p> jcowley@suntimes.com <p> White Sox recap <p> SOX AB R H BI BB SO Avg . <p> Podsednik lf 5 1 2 3 0 1 .250 <p> Iguchi 2b 4 2 1 0 1 1 .285 <p> Konerko 1b 3 2 2 1 1 0 .315 <p> Gload 1b 1 0 1 0 0 0 .217 <p> Dye rf 3 1 1 1 1 0 .299 <p> Crede 3b 5 2 3 4 0 0 .298 <p> Ozuna 3b 0 0 0 0 0 0 .427 <p> Widger c 5 1 1 0 0 0 .255 <p> Uribe ss 5 1 2 1 0 0 .209 <p> BrAnderson cf 5 2 2 1 0 0 .174 <p> FGarcia p 3 0 1 0 0 1 .333 <p> b-Cintron ph 1 0 0 0 0 0 .279 <p> Riske p 0 0 0 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 <p> Cincinnati AB R H BI BB SO Avg . <p> FLopez ss 4 1 2 0 0 0 .283 <p> BPhillips 2b 4 0 1 0 0 0 .302 <p> Griffey Jr . cf 3 1 1 0 0 0 .277 <p> McCracken cf 1 0 0 0 0 1 .174 <p> Aurilia 3b 4 1 1 3 0 1 .258 <p> Dunn lf 4 0 0 0 0 3 .235 <p> Kearns rf 3 1 1 1 1 1 .269 <p> Hatteberg 1b 4 0 0 0 0 0 .283 <p> Ross c 3 0 1 0 0 1 .341 <p> Claussen p 1 0 0 0 0 1 .095 <p> Mays p 1 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> Yan p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> a-LaRue ph 1 0 0 0 0 0 .182 <p> RiWhite p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> Totals 33 4 7 4 1 8 <p> SOX 424 001 010  --  12 16 0 <p> Cincinnati 300 000 100  --  4 7 2 <p> a-grounded into double play for Yan in the 7th. b-flied out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr .
