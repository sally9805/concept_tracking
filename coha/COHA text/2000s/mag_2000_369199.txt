The year 2000 was not the best of times for tyranny . True , Saddam Hussein began to shake off the shackles of world sanctions , all the while restocking his arsenal with the nastiest of weapons , unfettered and unwatched . Against all expectations , however , Yugoslavia 's strongman , Slobodan Milosevic , vanished  --  poof !  --  from power after calling an election he felt sure he 'd win , and then failing to steal the result from a populace that rose up to guard its rejection of his troublemaking . Another autarch actually took a turn toward benevolence all on his own : North Korea 's quirky Kim Jong Il reached out kindly to the previously abhorred , non-communist South , summiting gaily with its leader and making Korea 's pacification seem , suddenly , like a living prospect . Changes in Russia were more ambiguous as the blank-faced Vladimir Putin took charge . He was at least a sober antidote to the fitful Boris Yeltsin , but his unmoved reaction to the submarine Kursk 's demise and his unapologetic bludgeoning of Chechnya showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bleak . The world awoke this year to the unspeakable holocaust AIDS is wreaking there , a calamity that overshadowed the fights and famines already blighting the continent . <P> But the most blistering drama of all was in the Middle East . A final , true reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians looked breathtakingly close this summer , but finally claims to Jerusalem unleashed the furies .

On Sept. 24 Vojislav Kostunica , head of the center-right Democratic Party of Serbia , who had the support of a coalition of 15 opposition parties , seemed to have ended Milosevic 's 13-year autocratic rule . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported 48.22% for Kostunica , 40.23% for Milosevic . At Milosevic 's strong urging , a runoff was called . The opposition cried fraud , saying Kostunica had won nearly 55% of the vote . On Sept. 25 Kostunica ( inset ) declared victory . Protest rallies were staged . The commission was resolute until a week of massive protests and strikes culminated in the storming of the Parliament ( right ) in Belgrade on Oct. 5 . " I 've just received official information that Vojislav Kostunica won the elections , " Milosevic said the following day . " This decision was made by the body that was authorized to do so under the Constitution , and I consider that it has to be respected . " Milosevic said he would continue to head the Socialists as an opposition party , but most felt his time had passed . His allies were another question : in the aftermath of the boss 's concession , they maneuvered for positions in the new government and legislature .
