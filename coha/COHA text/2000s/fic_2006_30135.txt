The Assassins Gallery By David L. Robbins Random House David L. Robbins January 1 , 1945 Newburyport , Massachusetts Five hundred yards from the beach , a gloved hand choked the outboard motor . Six black-clad men took up silent oars . They rowed toward shore , urging the raft through whitecaps with a strong wind at their backs . Two hundred yards out , where the breakers began to build , Judith in her wetsuit slid , practiced and liquid , over the side . She said nothing to the six and they did not speak to her . She merely sucked in breath at the bite of the icy water through her rubber sheath , then pushed off from the raft . The boat eased away . She turned to kick for shore . Behind her , slaps of water against the raft faded beneath the wind . Judith spit saltwater . The immense cold clawed her cheeks and stung through the wetsuit . She kept her arms wrapped to her chest , letting the suit and the knapsack and her fins keep her buoyant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judith lowered her legs to float upright . A wave boosted her . At its crest she took a quick look at the beach under a veiled quarter moon . The coming storm flung foam off the whitecaps , a rabid water . She lifted the dive mask from her eyes to see better . She sank into a trough but another , taller roller swept in fast . Judith scanned the dark coastline . She saw nothing but vacant sand flats . No light glowedfrom the blacked-out town four miles beyond . She lowered her mask . Kicking the last hundred yards to the shore , she went numb . " It 's sure blowin ' stink , " she said . With a hand on his belly , the man agreed . Spray from the surf speckled the windshield of his pickup truck parked on the packed sand of Plum Island . " Nor'easter . " He pointed out the direction of the wind to the woman on the seat beside him . " Forecast called for it , " she replied . " Gon na be a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy New Year 's . " " You , too . " The two leaned across the seat to the center and kissed lightly . He had to angle down because she was short . He patted her leg when he straightened . " What time you got ? " she asked . He dug under his cuff for his watch . " We 're getting here a little late . We left the party a little before two . So I figure it 's . . . yep , two-ten . " " What do you think ? " " I think it 's blowin ' stink , like you said . You dressed warm enough ? You got a couple sweaters under them oilskins ? " " Yeah , but geez . Look at it . It 's cold as a well-digger 's ass out there . Why we got ta be so gung ho all of a sudden ? Who 's gon na invade Newburyport ? " " Honestly , Bonny , do n't start . You and me got the graveyard shift this week . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how it goes . " " Yeah , but . . . " She raised a hand at the crashing surf out in the dim light , water bashing the sand so hard that mist spewed . The pickup rocked a little with the wind , but it might have been Otto 's weight as he shifted to face her . " This is what we volunteered for , " he said . " Guarding the coastline . Think about the boys in uniform , they 're doin ' tougher shit than this all the time . You know that . " " Yeah , I know . " " Look , I understand we been kind of slack about this Civil Defense thing . All of us , the whole town . But I been doing a lot of thinking since that Battle of the Bulge started over in Belgium . You do n't think our boys are cold over there ? " She spread her hands . " Huh ? " he prodded . " You think ? " " Yeah , but look at this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I think it 's time we started doin ' our jobs here . That 's all I 'm saying . " " But Otto , geez Louise . Nobody 's doin ' nothing in this weather . You think the Germans are coming tonight ? They 're not gon na , okay ? You and me are the only ones out in this . " " And that 's a good thing . Come on , gim me another kiss . It 'll warm you up . " " You . All you think about . " " Is you . Come on . " With a sigh , she considered him . " Alright . C'mere . " She gave him more than a peck . " Yeah , thatta girl , " he said , pulling back to sit straight again . His gut extended far enough to rub the steering wheel . " Hey . " She wrinkled her nose at him , feigning annoyance that he wanted to get out of the pickup into this wintry , blustery night . " What ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't think Arnold knows , does he ? He was acting kind of weird yesterday when he came in the store . And tonight , at the party . " " Naw . Arnold 's always weird . He still thinks I 'm crazy for joinin ' the C.D. What the hell . I told him he should join , too , you know , do somethin ' . But he just goes to work and comes home and sits with his damn stamp collection . All night . Every weekend . Unless he 's fishing . I swear to God . " She grimaced , exasperated with the image of her husband . Slothful , skinny , only thinks about himself and his postage stamps . " Okay , " she said , fighting her temper , " okay , I wo n't do that . He 's not your problem . He ai n't here right now . Just you and me , right ? " The big man had tilted the back of his head against the window , away from her . He watched while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Look , you stay in the truck a little while , calm down . I 'll make one trip down to the Rowley line , then come get you . How 's that ? Okay ? You stay here , baby . " " You gon na be warm enough ? " " I 'm fine , " he chortled , thumping his stomach . " I got my winter fat on me . Be back in about an hour . I got some schnapps in the glove compartment there . Have a snort . What the hey , it 's New Year 's , right ? " " Right . You 're a good man , Otto . " " I try , baby . So , I 'll be back . You bundle up . I 'll leave the keys , case you want to run the heater some . " He squeezed her knee before opening the car door . He moved fast into the blowing chill to shut the door quickly . With a gloved fist he thumped the hood , then lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonny watched him walk up the beach . Moonlight lay across his broad back . He soon slipped it and stepped into the dark . When he had disappeared , she pushed the starter to crank the engine and run the heater full blast . She took his bottle from the glove compartment for a single , long pull . She put the bottle away , and stared straight out to sea . On hands and knees , Judith crawled over the last film of bubbles and saltwater . On dry sand , she dropped to her stomach . Her skin was so frozen she did not feel the grit of the beach against her cheek . She closed her eyes and caught her breath , angry at the frigid water but glad of the storm which blew her ashore ; without the waves sweeping her forward , she might not have made it . Inside her rubber suit she wriggled finger and toes ; they felt like cadaver 's digits . She hacked up a slime of mucous and salt , barely lifting her face to spit . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knapsack there . She sat up and shrugged the straps from her shoulders . The pack was waterproof and difficult to pry open with clumsy hands inside thick gloves . With her teeth , she gripped one glove to pull it off and flexed her bare hand to flush blood to her fingers . The second glove came off with trouble , too . She kicked the fins from her feet and hurried with the knapsack . The soaked wetsuit sapped her body 's remaining warmth on this icy beach . Her hands trembled . She needed dry clothes , quickly . The twin zippers of the pack slid reluctantly . Judith pinched the grips by sight , not by feel ; her fingertips relayed nothing . The top item was a black wool watch cap . She peeled the hood of the wetsuit off her head , rubbed her ears hard to animate them , then tugged on the cap , tucking her wet hair under it . Her eyes probed the darkness and mist . She 'd made landfall right on target . The beach road should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled down the zipper of her wetsuit . She spread apart the wetsuit from her naked chest , molting the rubber off her shoulders and arms . The thin moonlight diluted her coffee skin to a milky pallor . Her breasts and sternum prickled . From the pack she plucked a flannel long-john top and a thick wool fisherman 's sweater . She brushed sand from her buttocks , skimming the hard , cold muscles there , then shoved her legs into the bottom of the long johns and a pair of oilskin pants , cinching the waist . Using socks to swipe sand from her feet , she sensed nothing of her toes . The laces of her boots were tied badly , in a rush . A dark peacoat unfolded out of the bag , and Judith was dressed like a New England lobsterman . She rolled her wetsuit around the fins and mask to cram them into the satchel . She was ready to move off the beach . The last item taken out of the pack was a long , sheathed blade . She tucked this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg . Judith looked north and south . At her back , breakers unfurled and pounded , wind drove froth and sand ; snow would fall out of this storm before morning . Intelligence stated that this part of the beach , a mile south of the Coast Guard station and summer homes of Joppa , near the head of the Plum Island road , would be clear for fifty minutes following every hour dusk to dawn . The report said the townspeople guarded their territory sloppily , like a community hobby . Judith stood , warm now , and limber . She took three steps and did not see or hear the idling truck before the headlights nailed her . Bonny muttered , " Who the hell . . . ? " The figure caught in the headlights stopped . The guy just popped up out of the sand , maybe forty yards straight ahead down at the water 's edge . How could Otto have missed him , just standing there ? And what the hell was the guy doing out in this godforsaken weather ? Watching the waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man started walking toward the truck . He did n't look drunk , he strode erect . A little in a hurry . He had one hand up to his armpit , tucked in the strap of a sack or something on his back . Dressed like a fisherman but he was slender ; those men tended to be thick , hard , and bearded . Besides , with the war on , all the young ones were gone . Bathed in the headlights , coming on , he seemed tan-skinned , maybe one of those Portuguese up from Gloucester . " Son of a bitch , " Bonny grumbled to Otto , him and his **32;1552;TOOLONG bullshit . If he 'd stayed right here in the warm truck , he 'd be getting the chance , instead of leaving her alone to do it . She opened the glove compartment . Losing sight of the stranger for seconds , she took one more pull on the schnapps . She screwed the cap back on , growing nervous , and tossed the bottle on the seat . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes off the advancing stranger , she reached her arm over the seat , down into the space behind . She rattled her hand through trash , oil cans , rags , and coffee mugs until she found what she was looking for , a tire iron . She grabbed it . Bonny clapped it once into her palm , satisfied it had enough heft . She left the motor running , the headlamps on , and got out of the truck . " Can I help you ? " she called the moment her boots were on the sand , even before she slammed the truck door . The wind blew her question back into her face . " Sir ? " She shouted louder . " Can I help you ? " The figure , washed in the lights , walked closer , unconcerned . Bonny held the tire iron out where the fellow could see it . Maybe he did n't speak English . " Sir ? You understand this is a restricted area after dark ? There 's a curfew in effect . " Bonny took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the lamps where she could be seen and appreciated as an authority figure with a weapon in her hands . The slender man stayed silent , raising a gloved hand in greeting . He smiled . " I need you to stop right there , sir . " He came ahead , waving , friendly but ignoring her command . Bonny gripped the tire iron with both hands . When the stranger was a dozen steps away from the truck and casting a long shadow on the beach , he held his position . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I did not hear you . The ocean . " He had an accent . Bonny could n't place it . Probably one of the Portuguese . " I said , sir , that this is a closed beach after dark . There 's a curfew . I need to see some identification . " Bonny enunciated clearly . The guy must be stupid and foreign since he was n't drunk . The stranger screwed up his face . It was a lean face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dark cap . He pulled off the hat and black hair tumbled to his shoulders . Her shoulders . Bonny eased her grip on the tire iron . " Honey , what are you doin ' out here like this ? It 's the middle of the damn night in a damn storm . Where you from ? " The woman shrugged , hat in hand . " I had a fight , with my husband . He tried to hit me . I took a walk , that was all . " The accent was French-like . Some kind of European , anyway . The woman had blue eyes , odd to go with that skin . " I was here , just here . " She pointed off to the water 's edge . " Sitting when you drove up . " No , you were n't , Bonny thought . Otto would 've seen you , missy . " Let me see some ID . " Bonny 's right fist closed again around the base of the tire iron , the knobby end in her left palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what this woman was , or what her business was out here in a restricted area with a damn nor'easter on its way in the dark . Or how she got here . But all that would be hashed out before this gal walked on . " Yes , yes , " the woman answered eagerly . " I have here . " She dug into her peacoat for a slip of paper , then held it out . Bonny stayed where she was , making the woman step up to hand it over . Bonny raised the slip to the headlights .
