Triple Threat Kyle Korver of surprising Creighton is no longer just a three-point artist // Basketball is n't just a passion for Kyle Korver , the high-scoring forward for No. 16 Creighton , but it 's also something of a second religion for his entire family . Kyle 's father , Kevin , is the senior pastor of the Third Reformed Church in Pella , Iowa , where he was a shooting guard for Division III Central College in the mid-1970s . Kyle 's mother , Laine , also played for Central , at forward , after once scoring 74 points in a high school game . Three of Kyle 's uncles played at Division III or NAIA schools in Iowa . ( Two uncles are now clergymen , as well . ) All three of Kyle 's younger brothers play too , including 18-year-old Klayton , a forward at Pella Community High who last fall committed to Drake in Des Moines . " Most of my friends in Pella played football , but I always played basketball because of my family , " says Kyle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gym . " // As a result of his upbringing , Korver , a 6 ' 7 " senior , now possesses one of the most divine shooting strokes in the nation , which has enabled him to help Creighton to its best start in more than three decades . The Bluejays were 11-1 after Korver scored a game-high 23 points in their 84-63 win over Drake on Sunday . Though it dropped one notch in this week 's AP poll , Creighton is still ranked for the first time since 1974-75 . The runaway favorite to win his second straight Missouri Valley Conference player of the year award , Korver was leading Creighton in scoring ( 19.8 points a game ) , rebounds ( 5.8 ) and assists ( 3.3 ) . He was also fourth in the nation in three-pointers made per game ( 4.7 ) and was hitting 54.4% of his shots from beyond the arc . // Korver 's long-range shooting is so good that he made 67.6% of his three-point attempts in Creighton 's first four games , which were played using experimental rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 6 " , nine inches farther than normal . Says Bluejays coach Dana Altman , " The ball looks so good coming off his hand , you 're surprised when it does n't go in. " // Korver practices hard , but he refuses to adopt an overly structured regimen . " Coaches have tried to give me drills and programs , but that makes practicing feel like a job , " he says . " I shoot until I feel comfortable , and then I stop . " Since arriving at Creighton , Korver also has worked hard to prove he 's more than just a shooter. // Creighton earned automatic bids to three of the last four NCAA tournaments by winning its league tournament , and last March , Korver had 16 points in the Bluejays ' 83-82 first-round upset of fifth-seeded Florida in the Midwest Regional . But he sees that as mere prelude . " I 'm not looking back on my career right now and thinking , O.K. , that 's enough , " he says . " No real player does that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Battered Bruins Can This Coach Be Saved ? // UCLA coach Steve Lavin likes to refer to the start of conference play as the second season , and its arrival this year may be especially welcome because it marks the end of a miserable first season for the Bruins . After its worst nonconference start ( 2-5 ) in 18 years , UCLA began Pac-10 play last week on a positive note by sweeping conference doormats Washington and Washington State on the road . " Right now we need all the positive momentum we can get , " said Lavin. // It 's probably no coincidence that UCLA has played much better away from home , where the calls for Lavin 's firing have been everywhere . " Sometimes when you 're snuggling , it helps to get out of Los Angeles , " Lavin says . // It also helps to be at full strength . Three talented sophomores , forward Andre Patterson , swingman Dijon Thompson and guard Ryan Walcott , missed several games in the first two months because of injury or eligibility issues , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable 10-man rotation . Forward Jason Kapono 's 44-point explosion against Washington State , on 9-of-10 shooting from three-point range , also bodes well . // Even in victory , however , the Bruins ' shortcomings were apparent as they committed 29 turnovers in last Thursday 's 77-67 win over Washington . What 's more , the Bruins frequently have shown a lack of passion . " I do n't think everyone in this locker room always understands what it means to play for UCLA , " says senior guard Ray Young . " We should know by now that we need to play hard or we 'll lose . " // Losing is probably not an option for Lavin , who has a new boss in first-year athletic director Dan Guerrero . Four weeks ago Guerrero fired football coach Bob Toledo , who was 49-32 in seven seasons , and since then the AD has had numerous chances to give Lavin a public word of support , but he has remained conspicuously silent . UCLA has been to five Sweet 16s and one Elite Eight during Lavin 's six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late rush to save his job . Still , Lavin believes that will happen . " I 've always said that if you stay on the path of progress , you 'll make the necessary improvements to succeed , " he says . // Butler 's Free Throw King Archey 's Mark : 76 and Counting // As Darnell Archey , Butler 's senior guard , closed in on the NCAA record for consecutive free throws made , his teammates grew increasingly reluctant to mention the streak for fear of jinxing him . Archey , however , counted the numbers to himself as he made each one , right through the record-breaking 74th consecutive shot last Saturday late in the first half of the Bulldogs ' 68-65 win over Illinois-Chicago . He made two other attempts in the second half to boost the new mark to 76 . " I was joking with my teammates that I was going to shoot the last few with my eyes closed , " said Archey , who had n't missed a foul shot since Feb. 8 , 2001. // As a senior at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went after Steve Alford 's school record of 64 straight , but his quest ended at 40 . Likewise he 'll undoubtedly come up short of the NCAA record for career free throw percentage ( 90.9% ) , which is held by Greg Starrick , who played at Kentucky and Southern Illinois from 1969-72 . Archey , a reserve until this season , almost certainly wo n't get the 300 made free throws required to qualify . ( Through Sunday he was 119 for 125 in his career , a 95.2% clip. )
