Steven Popkes 's previous contributions to our pages include " Tom Kelley 's Ghost " and " The Great Caruso . " Like many of his stories , his latest is deceptively quiet-it does n't have loud car chases or big-budget special effects , but it 's very effective nonetheless . <p> TOMAS COBAN LOOKED OVER his cup of coffee , out his kitchen window , past the alleyway and toward the river , to watch the drones hovering outside his window watching him . A single Russian EX400 , looking like nothing more than a lumbering blimp , suggested the Kremlin felt comfortable with the world today . America wanted some attention since he could see at least a dozen wasp-sized 1200s , each a meticulous clockwork of pinhead sensors and cameras . Behind them all , hovering narrow and lethal , were four Israeli Darts . Jerusalem was feeling insecure . Beyond that , it was more or less a standard mix . He recognized about twenty different models . There were a few new unidentifiable workhorses obviously purchased from one of the standard suppliers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He watched them and , like always , felt a faint shiver at the amount of deadly force arrayed outside his window . Remember , he told himself , they 're like a pack of wild dogs : do n't attack and do n't run . They 'll kill you if you run . <p> One more day , he thought . You have to count them one at a time . One more day to be alive . <p> His room was austere : a room to sleep in , a couch in front of the feed and a kitchenette off to one side . He could eat , sleep , and watch the world without walking more than five steps . From the outside , his building was unremarkable : a beige apartment building , slant shadows in the Albuquerque sun . Its chief distinguishing feature was the cloud of small aircraft , none larger than crows , hovering near his third-floor window . <p> It was still February and the predawn weather was crisp when he stepped outside in his running suit . Tomas kept himself nondescript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair grow . He purchased clothing that imitated the styles of those he saw around him so he could blend in . Tomas even went so far as to lighten his normally dark skin so that he no longer looked like a mestizo but more like an upper class Mexican or an Italian . His only distinguishing mark was the cloud of drones that followed him everywhere he went . <p> Ah , he thought . Who knows ? Someday things could change . <p> He looked around and rubbed his hands , then started jogging . Some of the drones liked to stay eye level with him , watching his face - this was a particular feature of the American devices . Americans liked media and it bled through even into their automated surveillance systems . Other countries did n't care as long as they were within a specific striking distance from him . He turned off Central Avenue and started on the trail that led up to San Gabriel Park . <p> Dawn cracked over the horizon and turned the twilight into sharpedged day . The sandstone glittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been edged in black . <p> Coban liked to rest briefly on a particular bench looking down over the Rio Grande . As he rounded a bend in the trail , he stopped . Someone else was sitting on his habitual bench . Someone with his own cloud of drones . <p> He slowed to a walk as he approached the bench . The man on the bench was sitting , fiddling with a cane and drawing his jacket close around himself . He looked up at Coban . Coban could see the contours and shapes of his own face looking back at him . Not the same , of course . Their faces had been created nearly twenty years ago and the mileage on each had been different . This man had never pursued anonymity with Coban 's intensity . But the resemblance was still close enough to see . <p> " Tomas Tikal , " said the man on the bench . He fiddled with his cane again . <p> " Tomas Coban , " Coban replied . <p> " I know . I 've been expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat next to him . He looked up and watched the drones circle each other , each executing intricate handshake maneuvers to determine the other 's authenticity . A brief flash and one of Tikal 's drones flared and fell to the ground . <p> " I was wondering about that one , " Tikal said dryly . " I suppose its signature did n't match up . " <p> " What are you doing here ? " Coban asked . " We 're not supposed to seek each other out . " <p> " That 's not exactly true . " Tikal crossed his arms against the cold and Coban wondered where he had been living for the last twenty years . " We 're allowed to interact under precisely controlled conditions and when we 're thoroughly monitored . " He waved to the drones . " I think we 're being monitored sufficiently . " <p> " What do you want ? " <p> Tikal did n't answer . Instead , he watched the drones fly over them . " Things would have been completely different if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would have picked one of us at random , declared him the right one and executed him . " <p> Coban stared at him . What was going on here ? " If it had been the Russians , we would all be dead the moment a glorious victory was declared . A quick mock trial and then on to the next . So what ? Our own people would n't have needed a trial or proof . You know that . Only the Americans were interested . And then only because we slaughtered some American nuns . " Coban glanced away . It would n't do to let Tikal watch his face too closely . They were alike enough Tikal might be able to detect what he was thinking . " They should have killed us and been done with it . That 's what I would have done . " <p> Tikal laughed . " Me , also . A peculiarity of the American psychology , do you think ? The messianic determination to blame a single human face for a crime . Hitler , Pol Pot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That could be why they have kept us in custody . " <p> " Perhaps . " He thought about his so-called brothers . There were seven of them : each changed to resemble Tomas . All of them had the same plastic surgery scars on face , hands , and feet . At first they were thought to be clones , but DNA comparisons dispelled that immediately . It would have been easier if they had been clones . Tomas , the original Tomas who must have been hiding among them , had mixed samples of his own DNA with the others in all of the places where he had been known to reside . A bed where Tomas had been known to sleep had skin and hair from all seven of them . A razor with which he had cut his face was stained with multiple samples of blood . Bloody Tomas , without kin , without family , without even a surname , had disappeared in plain sight . <p> After several years of investigation , the Americans gave up and decided they could not determine which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surname according to where they had been found : Tulate , Tikal , Cuban , Dolores , Pasion , San Jose , and Livingston . <p> Coban ached for a cigarette . As far as he knew , it had been six years since he 'd had one - if he , in fact , had ever smoked at all . Perhaps , Tomas had smoked and bequeathed the addiction to him without tobacco ever staining his lips . <p> Coban looked back at Tikal . He had not aged well . He was heavier and his cheeks sank from his face as if the skin were disconnected from the tissue beneath . Maybe he had been older than the rest of them . This could be the result of mere aging . <p> " So this is what you are doing now ? Crossing the country to speak with old friends ? " <p> Tikal blew through his teeth and said nothing for a moment . " Tulate is dead . Heart attack . Dolores would only speak with me if I bought him dinner and then he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . I spent an hour shouting through his closed door . San Jose was in the hospital for a gallstone operation . He had trouble speaking but he had no difficulty making it clear to me I was to leave him alone . Livingston was the only one glad to see me . He wanted to borrow money . So , no . I ca n't say I 've been a popular visitor . " He glanced furtively at Coban , then returned to watching the drones . <p> " Cheer up . " Coban smiled . " I 'm not displeased to see you . " <p> " Such an enthusiastic greeting for your brother . " <p> Coban shrugged . " Take what you can get . " <p> Tikal said in a low whisper . " Did you remember anything ? " <p> " Nothing , " Coban replied in a normal voice . He gestured toward the drone . " They hear everything whether you want them to or not . I remember nothing more than I did the day I was captured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They began when he took power and ended just before he altered them himself . Memories of his childhood , his country of origin , his original ethnic heritage , were absent . Only the method of the alteration could be determined . Any record of additional manipulation , any pirate changes or traps , had been removed . When he awoke , he knew only that he was Tomas , had turned Guatemala into a bloody police state for fifteen years only to be deposed by the Americans . His last memory was his own face , shining down on him from a mirror over the table , his smile rigid , his jowls heavy , his mustache narrow and dark , his head shaved and shrouded in a nest of cables . Then , his face had dissolved into a formless brown mist , eyes , ears , cables , and finally that smile . The memory was obviously contrived : a signature to the changes in his mind and a defiant insult thrown at the Americans who would inevitably be able to retrieve it . <p> " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should have killed us . Or kept us in prison . " <p> " Even genocidal tyrants suffer changes in fashion , " snapped Coban . " For God 's sake , Tikal . It 's been six years since we were released and you 're sniffing around me now ? What do you want ? " <p> " I 've come to apologize . " <p> " Apologize ? " Coban shook his head . " What for ? " <p> " I am the real Tomas , " he said matter-of-factly . " I can say it now . I am allowing myself to say it now . " <p> Coban stared at him . This he had not expected . <p> " I have come to each of you , " Tikal continued . " To apologize for taking away your faces , your memories , and your lives . " <p> " No apology to the thousands of people we killed ? Surely we can spare a tear for them . Or the three hundred American soldiers we slaughtered ? I would n't cry for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of hucks - " <p> " Stop it ! " <p> Coban tilted his head and watched Tikal for a moment . " Did I struggle ? " <p> " Beg pardon ? " <p> " Did I resist ? Or did I volunteer ? " <p> " It does n't matter - " <p> " You are wrong , " Cohan said , interrupting him . " If I volunteered , then you have nothing for which to apologize . " <p> " I took your face - " <p> " - which I may have freely given . " Coban turned aside and let it go . " Where have you been ? " <p> " To all of you , one at a time . " <p> " No doubt . But I meant where have you been all this time ? Where did they station you ? " <p> Tikal did n't say anything for a moment . " Washington . " <p> " Ah , " Coban said dryly and fell silent . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> Coban spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It sounded ... critical . " <p> Coban watched the drones . They had settled into a figure eight pattern over their heads , each group chasing the other . " We have the same memories . It seems more than coincidental that the one who determines himself to be the original has all this time been quartered in the capital of those who deposed us . " <p> " None of the others questioned me like this . " <p> Coban shrugged . " We began with different brains even though we had the same memories and motivations . Some differences were bound to show up . What happens now ? " <p> Tikal looked uncertain . " I want absolution . I sent thousands to their death in the weapons breeding camps at Playa Grande . I struck down the Americans with parasites at the battle of Campur . I forced my own people to march on the Americans and then detonated the toxins in their bodies as soon as the battle was engaged . I did terrible things . " <p> Coban patted him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have the same memories . But who is to say it was you ? The Americans ? It could have been any of us . Truth be told , it could have been all of us . We were all there . We were all present at these places at one time or another . Perhaps we all gave some of the orders . Would that make you feel better ? " <p> " All of us ? " Tikal said faintly . <p> Coban let his gaze wander over the river . How curious the same river that borders Texas is also here , so many hundreds of miles away . " I think Tomas emasculated us at the end . He took from us the memories that made him what he was . Could you have truly done what we remember doing ? " <p> Tikal shook his head . <p> " Nor I. " Coban stared at the water . " Tomas was a sociopath , obviously . Perhaps I am - perhaps we are - as well . But to express your pathology on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not capable of that . " <p> Tikal stared at him , horrified . He stamped his cane on the ground . " You feel no remorse for what he did ? " <p> " What difference would it make if I did ? Would one village remain unslaughtered if I managed to feel bad about it ? " Coban held up his hands . " Besides , Tomas changed our memories and altered our minds . Can we truly be considered the same person ? Have we not been absolved by that alteration ? " <p> Tikal shrank back against the bench . <p> " Who am I , anyway ? " continued Coban , leaning forward . " A timid professor ? A coerced peasant ? A rabid volunteer ? I can never know . Or am I the man who attempted , however misguided , to modernize my home country ? To bring them electricity , water , roads ? At the expense of some of their lives , I grant you . Which would you rather be ? Tomas or what you were , knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Tomas is to be nothing . " <p> Tikal seemed to huddle into himself . " What I did was wrong . " <p> " You sound like a little boy crying to his father . Is that what they did to you in Washington ? " Coban looked at him speculatively . " Maybe you are the original . Perhaps repentance for the act can only come from someone in whose brain still resides those deeper synapses and circuits . " He leaned toward him . " I can only remember from when I took power to seeing my own face before I went into the machine . Can you remember beyond that ? Think , man . " <p> Tikal shook his head . " No . But what I did in power , I remember . And what I remember , I repent . I have thought on it for years . I sit on the patio outside my house - " <p> " A house ? You have a house ? " Coban stood and paced . " It becomes clear . You must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of us before we were captured ? I only remember meeting you , and the rest , when they brought us to Leonard Wood . The seven of us , copies all , sitting in that room staring at each other . One by one they took us and I never saw any of the others again until today . After all the questioning and the testing , you were the one they picked to work on . I was sent here to sit on my ass and wait for judgment , or so I thought . All the time , I was a spare . A control . Something against which they measured you . Oh , the skill ! Oh , the pure deviousness of it ! Tomas would have been proud . " <p> Tikal relaxed slowly . " I am the original , then . I was n't sure . They told me I was and I wanted to believe them - to feel remorse , I told myself . Someone should feel remorse . I should n't be here working my garden , petting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A garden , " Coban repeated dryly as he sat down . " I have a tiny apartment over an alley . " <p> " But I wanted it to be my garden . My cat . " <p> " So it is , " pronounced Coban . " It is all yours . " <p> " Yes . I am the original . " <p> Coban watched Tikal speculatively for a long time . " Certainly , somebody has to be . If we are all unmanned , certainly you are more emasculated than the rest of us . It is only right you should be proclaimed the original . " <p> Tikal looked at him . " ' Proclaimed ' ? " <p> " Tomas escaped . That has to be it . We are all copies . You were the one most likely to serve as his sacrificial lamb . " <p> Tikal stared at him anxiously . " He could n't have escaped . They looked everywhere and they found us . There were all the clues : the DNA , the faces . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a genius . He staged us all to make it seem as if he were hiding among us . But think : such an arrogant egomaniac as Tomas , which you and I can clearly see for ourselves better than anyone , would never erase himself merely to survive . He made us up to he him and then disguised himself and left . After all this time , the Americans have never found him . Then , the time comes and you repent and somebody in Washington says , ' Maybe we were wrong . Maybe Tomas did hide a pearl among pearls . At long last , he repents of his crimes . Could he be the real Tomas ? ' And another , more powerful and wiser man says , ' Even if Tomas escaped , he is old and surely near death and can not hurt us . ' And perhaps an even more powerful and still wiser man says , 1It does not matter for this is the Tomas we have . Let us release him to seek his fellows and watch what he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . What shall you do ? " <p> " I am the real Tomas , " Tikal said . <p> Tikal jumped up from the bench and ran down along the river . For a moment , the drones stilled their flight . More than half of them shot after Tikal . <p> Tikal stopped then , perhaps a hundred feet away . Coban could tell from his movements , Tikal had planned this for some time . Good for you , he thought . <p> Tikal fiddled with his cane for a moment , then rushed the drones , leaping up at them and beating at them with his cane . Tikal would never have hit any of them but several fell . He must have a device in the cane , thought Coban . For a moment , Coban thought he might actually manage it . <p> The drones hesitated , then two of the Israeli Darts shot forward . With a strangled cry , Tikal collapsed . Coban grinned sourly . It fit that the Americans would make sure to keep their own hands clean . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here soon . One could always trust to American ingenuity and thoroughness . He left the park and jogged back toward his apartment . <p> As he ran , one by one , his own entourage of drones detached themselves and left him . The Israelis were already gone . Coban watched them : first the unidentified insects , then one country after another , as they were no doubt informed by the Americans that Tomas was dead . Finally , the Russian blimp lumbered away . By the time Coban reached Central Avenue , only the American drones remained . He was as close to alone as he had ever been in fifteen years . <p> Coban stepped into his building . The wasps followed him outside , following his heat signature as faithfully as wives . That was all right . He could deal with a few of them . <p> The time had come , he thought . When he never thought it would come at all . He remembered his own face , Tomas 's face , staring back at him . In hindsight , it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than he did . Perhaps Tikal was the original after all . <p> But it did not matter to Coban any more than it mattered to Tomas . Tomas was an idealist . He had wanted to create a vision of the world . Whether he accomplished it biologically or through a creature imprinted with his personality made no difference to him . <p> Tomas Coban spread his arms in the windowed sun . It was good to be alive . <p> IMG
