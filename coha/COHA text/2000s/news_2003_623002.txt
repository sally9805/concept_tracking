<p> An estimated 200,000 people of nearly all ages spilled into lower Market Street on Sunday in San Francisco for a spirited but peaceful protest against U.S. plans to invade Iraq . <p> Ringing cowbells , banging temple drums , chanting , singing , dancing and waving colorful signs , puppets and placards , the marchers moved slowly up Market in a huge anti-war demonstration . While most simply walked the route , many pushed baby carriages , underscoring the argument that war would threaten the future of children most of all . <p> The march came one day after millions of people around the world demonstrated against the U.S. government 's stance on Iraq . It coincided Sunday with an war protest in Sydney by about 200,000 people . <p> Organizers of the San Francisco march gave an initial crowd estimate of 200,000 to 250,000 , while San Francisco police estimated the crowd at possibly 200,000 . <p> " I 'm just totally overwhelmed by the turnout today , particularly when you consider that there were something like 150,000 people turned out for protests in other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national co-chair of United for Peace and Justice , one of five co-sponsors of Sunday 's march and rally . <p> Although the main demonstration remained peaceful , a group estimated at 1,000 protesters broke away later in the afternoon and vandalized businesses and clashed with police along Market Street before some were arrested . <p> The main march began around noon at Justin Herman Plaza near the Ferry Building and headed to the Civic Center , stretching for more than a mile along Market Street . It took almost three hours for the demonstration to pass by . <p> Many of the demonstrators flocked to the rally on mass transit . BART spokesman Mike Healy estimated a jump of as many as 150,000 in Sunday 's ridership over the same day a year ago . <p> However they arrived , by the beginning of the protest , tens of thousands of people already had packed lower Market Street from Justin Herman Plaza to Davis Street . Thousands more gathered on the sidewalks , and additional thousands streamed down Market Street toward the Ferry Building to join them . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to poetry , songs and speeches by anti-war speakers . <p> " We 're bold , we 're courageous , and we 're loud , " Assemblyman Mark Leno , D-San Francisco , said during the hourlong rally at the beginning of the march . " March on , and let your voice be heard . We will not let the war happen . " <p> Another speaker , Assemblywoman Patricia Wiggins , D-Santa Rosa , also drew applause from the crowd when she posed the rhetorical question : " How do you want to spend $1.5 trillion ? On our children ? Or on war ? " <p> STRANGERS MINGLE EASILY <p> Despite the huge number of strangers thrown together for the march , the crowd had a carnival-like atmosphere and the friendly , cheerful mood of gigantic block parties . Many demonstrators greeted each other with hugs , and some said they were glad just to have a chance to make their views known to others . <p> Erica Hughes , who was joined by fellow high school teachers from Sacramento , said it was encouraging to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's inspiring to see we 're not alone in thinking we should n't be at war , " she said . <p> Those in the mammoth crowd carried a variety of signs , banners and flags advocating a host of disparate causes ranging from straightforward pleas against war to support for medical marijuana , solar energy and selenium as a cure for cancer , hepatitis C and AIDS . <p> A woman with her hair done in purple spikes carried a placard that read : " War is SOOO last century . " <p> Many of the signs called President Bush and his top advisers international criminals . Several called for Bush 's impeachment , while hand-painted signs carried by two young girls likened him to the villain of the Harry Potter stories  --  " Bush = Voldemort . " <p> The demonstrators were mostly white men and women between the ages of 20 and 60 , but the crowd appeared to include representatives of many ethnic and age groups , from tots in strollers to one elderly man who carried a sign that said , " Old Timers for Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dismissal of France and Germany for their governments ' wish to continue U.N . weapons inspections rather than quickly attack Iraq . <p> Some marchers wore Veterans of Foreign Wars garrison caps , and several showed up in full military uniforms , marching under a banner identifying them as veterans . <p> STRONG FOCUS ON CHILDREN <p> Particularly striking was the large number of children present . <p> " The war is wrong , " said 13-year-old Amanda Howes of Hayward , who was marching alongside her 14-year-old sister , Jenna . " We should n't send young men to be killed just because Bush is mad . " <p> Jenna added : " We should find a peaceful way to work out our problems . " <p> Tim Shelley of Sacramento demonstrated while carrying a sign that said " Triplets for Peace " and pushing a stroller with his three 4-year-olds , Maile , Jared and Callahan . <p> " They do n't know what 's going on , and I do n't want them to know what 's going on , " said Shelley , who said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his children " for their future . " <p> Juni Sepe , who drove to San Francisco from Los Angeles with her 9-year-old son , Patrick , and her friend Frank Sosa , joined in Sunday 's demonstration with her dog , Flaca , who wore a sign in Spanish that said " Dogs Against War . " <p> Sepe said they had outfitted Flaca with the sign because " she is a very calm dog . We rescued her from violence , and she got the message . " <p> Bayard Fox of Napa was holding a sign that said " Pray for a Bigger Pretzel , " a reference to the snack food that Bush accidentally choked on one afternoon at the White House . <p> " Of course , I do n't really hope that he chokes on a pretzel , " Fox said . " I 'm just cynical . " <p> TRYING TO FOLLOW JESUS ' COURSE <p> Dressed in long brown robes , his red beard glinting in the sun , Rami Fodda strode toward Civic Center Plaza from the nearby St. Boniface Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fodda , who said he grew up in Saudi Arabia and is studying to become a friar , worries that a war against Iraq will endanger the lives of his relatives in Jordan and Lebanon . He said his religious beliefs form the foundation of his opposition to a war against Iraq . <p> " The example of Jesus is the one I follow , " Fodda said . " When they came to take Jesus and Peter drew his sword to protect him , Jesus stopped him and said : ' He who lives by the sword dies by the sword . ' I am acting in that way . " <p> Along the route , some people were taking advantage of the large Sunday crowd to make a few dollars . A few small shops on Market Street that are usually closed on Sundays opened for the occasion . <p> Hawkers sold protest paraphernalia that included professionally printed anti-war signs , T-shirts emblazoned with " Blessed are the Peacemakers " and even voodoo dolls of Bush . <p> Earl Gadsden , a street singer who entertains tourists at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-war tune " Down by the Riverside , " with its famous line , " I ai n't gon na study war no more . " <p> Gadsden said he had made $11 in just 15 minutes and said of the tune , " It 's a good song  --  and today it 's a very good song . " <p> Peace was good for other businesses , too . <p> At Rainbow Pizza , where a slice normally sells for $2 , the owner had set up a table on the sidewalk in front and was selling slices for $3 apiece . <p> And the Javalisa Cafe was advertising a " Peace Rally Special " of chicken club sandwiches for $7 . <p> March sponsors set up a line of 29 garbage cans along the middle of the road near U.N . Plaza to collect donations to offset the cost of the rally , estimated to be more than $50,000 . <p> HAWK AMONG THE DOVES <p> Not everybody who turned out for the protest expressed an anti-war opinion , though . <p> Jeremiah Isbell , who moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to Civic Center Plaza to show his support for the troops . <p> The 18-year-old Isbell , dressed in camouflage and wearing a gas mask , had taped a hand-lettered sign to his backpack that said " Make War Not Stupid Delusions . " <p> Isbell , a solitary hawk , planned to walk toward the peace marchers as they moved toward Civic Center Plaza . <p> " People out here are a little crazy , and they 're in the minority anyway , " he said . <p> As protesters were gathering at Justin Herman Plaza , a biplane flew over the crowd towing a banner with the contrarian message : " Appeasing evil is immoral . " <p> While most of the marchers crowded onto Market Street , onlookers and supporters lined the march route on the sidewalks , many carrying their own signs and banners . Tourists , shoppers and other onlookers joined them , and between Sixth and Seventh streets on Market , spectators stepped out of adult bookstores and other amusement centers to take a look . <p> As the crowd swelled into Civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet Roitz watched her 2-year-old son , Dane , climbing in the playground . <p> " I 'd like to be able to tell him he was here , " Roitz said . " I hope it 's an historic event that means there will be peace , even though he wo n't remember it . It will be important to say he was here . " <p> City worker Marlon Dominguez , 48 , followed in the wake of the march , tidying up after the protesters , sweeping streets and emptying trash cans . <p> " They 're pretty clean , " Dominguez said . " Everything is good , and everybody is working together .
