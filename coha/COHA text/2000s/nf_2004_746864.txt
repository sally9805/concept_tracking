Drawing on technologies from fields as diverse as space physics and nuclear medicine , scientists are fast developing instruments to search for material that terrorists might use to fashion dirty bombs or a nuclear device . <p> Concerns about the illicit movement of radionuclides across national borders have heightened the degree of protection that the US and western European countries have instituted . The challenge is not only to detect hidden radioactive materials , but also to distinguish them from legitimate radionuclides such as radiopharmaceuticals that are often transported across borders and shipped throughout a country . Every day , more than 300 000 vehicles , roughly 2500 aircraft , and nearly 600 ships pass through US ports of entry . With more than 600 US border sites to protect , screening imported radioactive material requires a careful balance of high throughput and high search efficiency . Unfortunately , the two requirements are at odds : Rapid screening implies less counting time available to detectors ( see the article by Jay Davis and Don Prosnitz in PHYSICS TODAY , April 2003 , page 39 ) . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common imported goods are either intentionally or naturally radioactive . Commercial shipments of ceramic-glazed materials , abrasives , road salt , and even kitty litter , for example , contain naturally occurring radionuclides that may trigger false alarms from radiation detectors . Moreover , medical radionuclides are . used throughout the US , so the problem of detecting potentially illicit radioactive sources is not confined to border crossings . Approximately 120 000 people in the US can be expected to carry a detectable radioactive trace due to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures they 've undergone . <p> In 2003 , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) convened a conference ( n1 ) on the potential problems presented by radiological dispersal devices , or dirty bombs . Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham argued for an improvement in US technology designed to quickly detect radioactive materials that would pose a threat in a terrorist 's hands . And other attendees identified several radionuclides of particular concern : cobalt-60 , strontium-90 , cesium-137 , iridium-192 , plutonium-238 and - 239 , and americium-241 . To uncover the presence of such radionuclides , instruments must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters from the source and probably after the radiations have passed through intervening material . Several of those isotopes emit penetrating gamma rays with energies in the range of 50 to 1300 keV , while others , such as sup90Sr , emit beta particles that have relatively short ranges , a problem that makes them more difficult to detect . Bremsstrahlung photons produced when the sup90Sr beta particles interact with high-atomic-number materials will have a higher probability of detection due to their longer ranges . <p> The US , Russia , and other nations store large quantities of special nuclear materials ( SNMs )  --  fissionable radionuclides such as sup239Pu and the 233 and 235 isotopes of uranium  --  in protected locations , although the threat exists that such material could be stolen and fashioned into a nuclear device . Plutonium isotopes emit alpha particles , gamma rays , and characteristic x rays released in atomic transitions of bound electrons . Some of these x rays have energies below 30 keV , which makes them difficult to detect from a distance or if shielded . Neutrons are also emitted by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , n interactions with surrounding materials . <p> Like the low-energy x rays , alpha and beta particles emitted by the actinides and other high-risk nuclides have little penetrating power ; their energies are just a few MeV and their detection probability at the exterior of any container is nearly negligible . The radiations most amenable to detection at reasonable distances are gamma rays because of their exponential absorption in matter . The photoelectric and Compton interactions are dominant in the interactions of matter with photons that have energy below about 1 MeV . Secondary electrons produced from the collisions of gamma rays with atomic electrons can deposit their energy in materials such as gases , crystals , plastics , or organic liquids and may produce an avalanche of free electrons , electron  --  hole pairs , or light pulses , depending on the detector material and construction . New tools <p> In the laboratory , large , cryogenically cooled devices can sensitively identify the isotopic signatures of various emissions . However , those instruments were never intended to deal with the problem of searching for SNM in the large volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaports . The threat of terrorism has prompted researchers and manufacturers to develop new types of portable and more flexible instruments . <p> Four basic types of such portable instruments now exist . Personal radiation detectors ( PRDs ) are small , highly sensitive devices , about the size of a cell phone , that generally incorporate an inorganic scintillator ( converting high-energy photons to visible light ) coupled to a photo-multiplier tube along with electronic circuitry to count pulses and perhaps correct for background radiation ; some can even detect both photons and neutrons . For emergency first responders , for instance , PRDs provide a reliable alert to radiation levels at some preset threshold . <p> Hand-held survey meters similar to those found in nuclear power plants to measure exposure or dose equivalent rates can also be used to search for radioactive material . With slightly more sophisticated electronics than PRDs  --  better read-out capabilities , for instance  --  these meters may also contain interchangeable probes consisting of scintillation detectors and phototubes , and large-volume ( or high-pressure ) ionization chambers or neutron detectors . <p> Similar in size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often use a sodium iodide crystal , photomultiplier , and associated electronics to produce a pulse-height spectrum . In some instruments , the data can be compared to a stored library of spectra to identify the radionuclides . The difficult task of resolving the nuclides is normally performed using a cooled high-resolution detector , pulse-processing electronics , a multichannel analyzer , and a computer . The need to miniaturize a lab system , use batteries , and keep size , weight , and cost low inevitably compromises performance . Nevertheless , the hand-held meters provide valuable information to help discriminate between false alarms from naturally occurring or medical isotopes and real ones from high-risk radionuclides . A commercial instrument that was recently introduced uses a Stirling-engine cooler and portable high-purity germanium detector ; the continued development of such devices will undoubtedly result in newer , smaller , less-expensive models . <p> The fourth and largest detector type is the radiation portal monitor ( RPM ) . Large , usually plastic scintillators such as polyvinyl toluene make up these detectors , which are coupled to phototubes , mounted in moisture-resistant enclosures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in figure 1 . These devices primarily detect photons . Some plastic scintillators can also detect neutrons , but more often , RPMs with large 3He gas-filled detectors are used for that job . <p> Figure 1 . Highly sensitive portal monitors ( yellow ) installed in passenger lanes at the Pacific Highway crossing in Blaine , Washington , can detect the presence of small amounts of radioactive material just meters away . False alarms occur some , what frequently  --  most often from naturally radioactive agricultural products , ceramic tiles , and the rare passenger who may have just received a thallium , technetium , or iodine injection from a physician . Key contributors <p> Historically , a variety of research communities have advanced the field of radiation detection for their distinct purposes . In the particle physics community , the need to measure a wide range of subatomic particles was met by pioneers such as Georges Charpak , who received the 1992 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention and development of particle detectors  --  in particular , the multiwire proportional chamber , introduced in 1968 . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of radiations produced at accelerators worldwide . <p> At the low-energy end of the spectrum , diagnostic nuclear medicine developed segmented detectors to provide positional , imaging information from reconstruction of the photon transmission paths in the human body . Recently , medical engineers combined this computed tomography with positron emission tomography in a single unit . Both CT and PET detectors are optimized to record photons from 80 keV up to 511 keV , the energy of annihilation radiation . Because of the high effective atomic number needed to detect the 511 keV photons efficiently , bismuth germinate and other inorganic scintillators are now widely used . <p> To monitor the effluents of nuclear power plants for radionuclides that may be released to the environment , radiochemists use gamma-ray spectrometers and analysis software to deconvolve the fission and activation products from complex spectra with lines in the 20 keV to 2 MeV range . This kind of work has driven the development of large and high-resolution hyperpure germanium gammaray spectrometers . And the software that sorts through spectra to list component radionuclides is now commercially available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photon spectrometry to detect and identify nuclear materials , but with a focus on the low-energy x rays characteristic of the actinides and a few associated gamma-ray lines . This community developed much of the technology now found in PRDs , RIDs , and RPMs to monitor specific locations that contain SNMs ; they also incorporated software that analyzes emissions in the energy range typical of uranium and plutonium isotopes . <p> Weapons inspectors rely on instruments and techniques similar to those used for low-level radiochemistry measurements at nuclear power plants . The mixed-nuclide spectra may come from gaseous samples ( mixed radioxenons and kryptons ) or soil samples taken near nuclear facilities . The main requirements for the detectors used by laboratories are high photon-detection efficiency and high-energy resolution . <p> Measuring the neutron fluence and the neutron energy spectrum has long been a concern of health physicists because a detailed knowledge of both is required to accurately calculate the radiation effects of neutrons on biological tissue . Radiation protection dosimetry measurements for astronauts and workers at high-energy accelerators and nuclear power plants require a combination of detectors to sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photons and charged particles . Personnel dosimeters are used to determine the dose equivalent for radiation workers . These often use thermoluminescent materials to detect photons , and etched-track devices made of plastics to detect neutrons . Passive dosimeters require subsequent processing after exposure and are not useful for the immediate detection of radiation . <p> Researchers conducting solar neutrino physics experiments consider fast neutrons to be a particular nuisance . Distinguishing those neutrons from more interesting data has led to very sensitive methods of measuring low neutron fluences in the presence of high gamma-ray backgrounds . Schemes for neutron  --  gamma discrimination rely on pulse-shape discrimination or on coincidence signals from multiple detectors . The hardware and software advances in handling data from neutron scintillators may be readily incorporated into the next generation of sensitive neutron counters for nuclear materials . <p> There are two areas of concern when dealing with illicit radioactive sources : detection and protection . Different quantities and units are used in each field . Radiochemists and safeguards workers are comfortable with quantities such as activity and radionuclide mass , whereas those in health physics deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primer on how the quantities and units of one field can relate to another , see the box on page 40 . Gamma-ray detectors <p> Among the earliest scintillators used to detect ionizing radiation were organic compounds such as naphthalene ( Csub10Hsub8 ) and anthracene ( Csub14Hsub10 ) , in combination with photomultipliers that amplified their light output. ( n2 ) But today , sodium iodide activated with 1% thallium is the most frequently employed compound used to measure gamma rays , ( n3 ) partly because of its high-atomic-number iodine content , which increases photon detection efficiency . Other high-atomic-number materials used successfully include thallium-doped cesium iodide , bismuth germanate , and cadmium zinc telluride ; recently , cerium-doped lanthanum chloride and lanthanum bromide ( n4-n6 ) have been investigated . Lithium iodide can also be used to detect gamma rays , but it is often used to detect thermalized neutrons because of lithium 's high neutron cross section . <p> These inorganic scintillators produce light pulses as a result of interaction of gamma rays with atoms in the lattice . The high-energy photons kick out core- or valence-shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they recombine with holes left behind . When added in low concentration to the melt used to grow the crystal , elements such as thallium or europium create lattice vacancies that alter the electronic structure and control the photon wavelengths emitted  --  and thus create one of the properties needed for an effective scintillator . <p> Good scintillators produce large light pulses , whose intensities are proportional to the incoming photon energy . They must also be transparent to the wavelengths produced so that the light can escape , be detected , and be amplified in a later photomultiplier stage . <p> Figure 2 illustrates the difficulty of identifying a radionuclide using the various types of scintillators commonly found in the instruments that now search for high-risk radionuclides . In the laboratory , pure germanium provides a spectrum that clearly shows the photon energy peaks . But materials used in the field  --  NaI(Tl) , for instance , and the large plastic scintillators commonly used to monitor borders  --  have poorer resolution , which makes it more difficult to discern the identity of any radionuclides detected . <p> Figure 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the natural background gamma rays present in southeastern Washington . The high-resolution germanium detector ( blue ) outperforms the thallium-doped sodium iodide detector ( red ) , whose resolution is too limited to reliably identify as many individual radionuclide spectral lines . Large plastic scintillators ( light blue ) of the type used in a portal monitor system are an order of magnitude more sensitive , but even more unsuitable for energy discrimination . ( Data courtesy of W. K. Hensley , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , Richland , WA . ) <p> Moreover , many of the photons emitted by the materials of concern to emergency responders occur in an energy region where the scintillator 's absorption coefficients are changing rapidly . So their response as a function of incident photon energy will also vary significantly . The plot in figure 3 shows the mass attenuation and mass-energy absorption coefficients for CsI as a function of energy. ( n7 ) The large changes occur in the 1-500 keV range where the photoelectric absorption coefficient decreases , while the Compton interaction coefficient begins to increase and becomes the dominant contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detection capability of inorganic scintillators such as thallium-doped cesium iodide depends on their radiation absorption properties . This plot shows the mass attenuation coefficient / ? and mass-energy absorption coefficients suben/ ? as a function of photon energy . The coefficient / ? is akin to the exponential absorption coefficient and suben/ ? reflects the photon energy transferred to secondary electrons . Because the absorption coefficients rise rapidly due to the predominance of photoelectric interactions as photon energy decreases , the response of CsI(TI) scintillators necessarily increases for lower-energy photons . ( Data courtesy of J. H. Hubbell and S. M. Seltzer , NIST ; available at http : **62;2300;TOOLONG . ) <p> Due to the attenuation in any surrounding shielding , however , the fluence as a function of incident gamma-ray energy for these detectors will generally peak at approximately 60 keV and then fall off at lower energies . Therefore , the sensitivity of the scintillator-based instruments is relatively large for photons such as those emitted by sup241Am and plutonium isotopes . Neutron detectors <p> Californium-252 is occasionally used as a source of neutrons for in-patient cancer radiation therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosmic-ray-produced neutrons are also present as weak background radiation , but otherwise , neutron sources are scarce in everyday activities . So , if a neutron detector triggers an alarm at an airport or border crossing , it represents a situation of some concern because it could indicate the presence of a nuclear weapon . <p> To reliably register the presence of enriched uranium or plutonium , an instrument must detect a small fluence of fast neutrons and provide an energy spectrum fine enough to discriminate between a sup241Am  --  Be source used to confirm the presence of oil or water in an exploratory well , say , and weapons-grade plutonium . Although routine in the laboratory , these measurements are a tall order for a battery-powered RID . At the moment , no portable commercial instrument exists that can make reliable identifications of neutron spectra within seconds . <p> Because neutrons are indirectly ionizing particles , they interact by elastic and inelastic nuclear scattering to produce secondary charged particles . Gaseous and solid state detectors or organic scintillators can detect those charged particles . sup6LiI or 3He gas both have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detection purposes , the moderation of fast neutrons using a material such as polyethylene  --  which produces lower-energy neutrons from elastic scattering  --  makes it possible to take advantage of the large thermal-neutron absorption cross sections . Consider the following reactions : <p> sup6Li ( n , a ) 3H ( Q = 4.78 MeV ; ssubth = 940 barns ) ; sup10B ( n , a ) sup7Li ( Q = 2.31 MeV 93% or 2.79 MeV 7% ; ssubth = 3837 barns ; 3He ( n , p ) 3H ( Q = 0.764 MeV ; ssubth = 5333 barns ) . <p> Here , Q is the energy released in the reactions and sth is the thermal-neutron absorption cross section. ( n9 ) In this notation , a neutron incident on a sup6Li atom releases an alpha particle to produce 3He , for example . The high sensitivity of lithium , boron , and helium to slow neutrons is advantageous considering the low neutron-fluence rates routinely encountered . On the other hand , the decrease in magnitude of the cross sections at higher energies makes the detectors relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personal radiation detectors that are held close to the body may respond to moderated and reflected neutrons having a lowered energy and hence a greater likelihood of being sensed by a an inverse energy detector . <p> Figure 4 . To detect low-energy neutrons one usually employs one of three reaction targets  --  3He , sup10B , and sup6Li  --  whose cross sections are shown . The very large cross sections ( 1 barn = 10sup-28 m ) below about 10 eV provide the detector 's sensitivity . But designers have to moderate higher-energy neutrons to take advantage of these large cross sections . In that process , the practicality of the detector is somewhat compromised since the amount of moderating material necessary makes the detectors bulky and heavy . ( Neutron cross section data from the National Nuclear Data Center , Brookhaven National Laboratory , www.nndc.bnl.gov . ) <p> Neutrons are nearly always accompanied by photons , and in many cases the photon contribution to the fluence spectrum will be dominant . So instrument designers have to pay close attention to the sensitivity of neutron detectors to photons of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belt , neutrons entering the body can cause specific reactions that generate photons  --  in particular , the neutron capture reaction in hydrogen , iH ( n , ? ) H , which produces a 2.2-MeV photon . <p> Gaseous detectors that produce a pulse-height spectrum can sometimes discriminate between neutrons and photons . It may be possible to discriminate against photons simply by setting an electronic threshold above which photon-induced events are unlikely , for instance . Moderator-based neutron area-survey instruments often use that technique . Applying pulse-shape analysis may also be possible , if the pulse shapes are distinguishable , as they are , for example , in organic-crystal or - liquid scintillators . <p> A relatively recent development is the superheated-emulsion detector , which uses small droplets of superheated liquid suspended in a viscoelastic medium to detect neutrons . A fast neutron that interacts with a nucleus near one of those droplets can cause localized evaporation and the formation of a small vapor bubble . Optical or acoustical methods can then detect the bubbles and in some cases also provide enough detail to deduce some spectrometric information. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effective than emulsion detectors , but the need for a device small enough for a pocket or belt makes it difficult to incorporate a large neutron detector . The development of more efficient small devices is therefore a subject of significant interest , and a number of programs are under way at national laboratories , universities , and industrial research facilities . Currently available portable commercial instruments have limited neutron-detection capabilities . Homeland security <p> The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) signaled the US government 's commitment to mitigate terrorist threats . Emergency workers , such as firefighters , police , HAZMAT teams , customs officials , border-protection personnel , and Coast Guard staff , are being issued radiation detectors and radionuclide identifiers and are being trained in their use at airports , seaports , and land borders . <p> Even before it was formally created , staff members of what became DHS requested standards to evaluate the new instruments needed to detect and interdict illicit radioactive materials . The American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) developed the new standards , which cover personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and portal monitors , in record time with representatives from national laboratories , instrument manufacturers , and university researchers. ( n11 ) The standards will form the basis of performance tests carried out in the next few months and be used in a database for emergency response organizations that decide on new equipment purchases . That equipment purchased with DHS funding will itself have to undergo ANSI standards-based testing ; the goals are to confirm instrument performance and drive product improvement . DHS is also working to coordinate standards development and instrument performance testing with other governments. ( n12 , n13 ) <p> A brief summary of the tests required in the new standards includes <p>  --  resistance to mechanical shock and vibration <p>  --  battery lifetimes <p>  --  effects of environmental influences such as electromagnetic and radio frequency interference <p>  --  effects of temperature and humidity <p>  --  detection sensitivity and speed of response . <p> These type tests ( n11 ) are intended for specific models of commercial instruments and are meant to simulate the broad range of environmental conditions encountered in actual field use . The goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by emergency responders perform reliably . Research expectations <p> The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency ( HSARPA ) is encouraging researchers at universities and industrial facilities that partner with government labs to develop detectors for radiological and nuclear countermeasure systems . Some of the technical projects the agency expects to see developed in that effort include enhanced radiographic imaging systems ; methods to improve discriminating between naturally occurring radioactive materials and those that pose a threat , such as SNMs ; improved techniques to identify radionuclides ; mobile detection systems ; and communication and archiving of detector data . <p> Radiological imaging systems are expected to use both active and passive techniques to survey a wide variety of vehicles and containers . Los Alamos National Laboratory has recently developed a novel radiographic imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray-produced muons ( n14 ) ( see ' PHYSICS TODAY , May 2003 , page 19 ) . The radiation source in that case would always be freely available . Gamma-ray detectors are expected to have improved radiation detection and identification properties as discussed above , and their usability in a variety of field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities and gamma-ray discrimination remain on the HSARPA wish list . But the agency expects that improved hand-held radionuclide identifiers with increased sensitivity and advanced spectrum analysis algorithms are on the way . Portal monitors with spectral analysis capabilities are also under development . <p> Beyond the technical requirements , described in detail on the HSARPA webpage ( see www.dhs.gov ) , an essential practical requirement remains : The new instruments must become commercially available at a reasonable cost , so that large numbers of them can be purchased and deployed in a short time . By combining practical considerations with technical advances , the work needed to mitigate security threats should proceed at a brisk pace . <p>
