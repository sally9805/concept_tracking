<p> LIKE many starry-eyed entrepreneurs , James Warlick and his business partner concentrated their initial efforts on winning and serving customers and relegated mundane chores like taxes to the back burner . <p> " We were real excited , " recalled Mr. Warlick , the proprietor of what in 1994 was a fledgling operation that printed T-shirts . " We had an opportunity to start a business . " <p> It did n't take long , however , before Mr. Warlick , now 35 , began to notice that the financial numbers of a business that took in a mere $90,000 that first year were not being tracked carefully and income tax was due . Eventually , though no audits or penalties resulted , the inattention required extra costs of $15,000 to $20,000 to straighten things out . <p> " Unfortunately , we did n't have any accounting training at all , so right from the get-go we started putting things in the wrong areas in QuickBooks , " said Mr. Warlick , referring to the Intuit software series for small businesses . " I had to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that we had mischaracterized or applied to the wrong sectors . " Some deductions had been missed and some receivables went uncollected . <p> The urge to be masters of their financial fate has driven American entrepreneurs for generations . An estimated 671,800 enterprises with employees were created in 2005 , according to the latest figures tabulated by the Small Business Administration . <p> And the growth in the number of those new enterprises , averaging 5.6 percent for the most recent three years , may pick up because of the trend toward early retirement from other jobs , when many people turn hobbies into businesses . There is also stepped-up pressure for workers themselves to provide for retirement as traditional corporate pensions fade . <p> In addition , the baby-boom generation has begun to reach its 60s  --  and self-employment rates rise steadily with age . <p> But whether the owner of a new business is an avid amateur photographer setting out to work weddings on his weekends in retirement , or a prime-of-life entrepreneur considering a fast-food franchise , experts say that taxes should be a fundamental concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate structure , whether you start as a sole proprietorship , as a partnership or as a Subchapter S , limited-liability or even full C corporation . <p> " Show me your recent tax returns and then I can tell you " the most advantageous structure , said Kevin G. Bradley , an accountant in Rockville , Md . <p> " Your tax bracket is important because you could have a spouse who 's making $100,000 a year from another job , " Mr. Bradley observed . Other factors include the amount of capital you invest and your future financing plans , which may include selling shares . <p> A Subchapter S corporation , for example , may save on self-employment taxes  --  15.3 percent for Social Security and Medicare this year  --  but limit the amount you can put aside in tax-deferred retirement accounts . <p> Many people , of course , earn money from sidelines , like child care or freelance writing , without doing anything more than reporting the income on Schedule C of the Form 1040 ( not to be confused with C corporations filing Form 1120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , becoming tax chiselers who may operate for years without being caught . Those who thrive , however , usually reach a point where they are forced into legitimacy . <p> " What usually brings people in the door if they 've been living under the radar is if they 're trying to buy a new house or do some financial transaction where they will need this other income to help them qualify , " said Sharon Peters Martin , an accountant and proprietor of Advance Financial in Silver Spring , Md . " Those are usually what make people stand up and say , ' Oh yeah , I do do this . ' " <p> If a start-up expects annual revenue to exceed $50,000 , Ms. Martin tends to favor incorporation because the resulting business is typically taxed less heavily than a sole proprietorship , though extra record-keeping might offset the savings . <p> But the Internal Revenue Service , from which you must obtain an employer identification number and which you must satisfy as to employment , unemployment and possibly excise taxes on products or businesses , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> States and sometimes county and local governments will also have their hands in your pockets . Maryland , for instance , requires most companies to pay a $300 annual fee to register a business and then assesses furniture , machinery , inventory and other assets for what is perplexingly called a personal property tax . This levy , ranging from about 1 1/2 percent to 4 percent , is imposed and collected by local jurisdictions . <p> As elsewhere , retail businesses also have the chore of serving as collectors of the state 's 5 percent sales tax on most goods . Businesses remit this at intervals , based on size . <p> Faced with the press of daily operations , fledgling managers can make numerous mistakes ; perhaps the most costly one is failing to promptly engage professional help  --  especially accountants but also lawyers and , often , insurance agents . <p> " They do n't know what they 're supposed to be filing and can go two years " before a problem is noticed when , say , one authority talks to another , Mr. Bradley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I.R.S. One is efforts by managers of some companies to minimize Social Security and Medicare taxes by taking unreasonably low salaries and using the money instead for dividends or to repay loans . <p> Another offense that is likely to get you into serious trouble is failure to remit taxes withheld from employees . That money carries fiduciary responsibilities that can leave an entrepreneur personally liable even if the business fails . <p> Experts say that you should open bank accounts to be used strictly by the business , so that its funds are not mixed with personal ones . <p> " It 's going to make tax-preparation costs a lot less than if I have to try to figure out what is business and what is not , " said Ralph L. Benson , another area accountant , who specializes in small businesses . <p> Although the law is complex , riddled with gray areas and subject to frequent judicial as well as legislative change , there is a wealth of tax and other information available to those who are starting businesses . <p> The I.R.S. has an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 583 , Starting a Business and Keeping Records . The wide-ranging Small Business Administration site , www.sba.gov , can steer you to the Service Corps of Retired Executives , an S.B.A.-funded organization with 400 offices where nearly 12,000 volunteers mentor small businesses at no cost . <p> MR . WARLICK 'S 15-employee company , now called Colorworks Promotions , has evolved since its 1994 start , from a partnership to a Subchapter S corporation that did nearly $4 million of business last year . <p> In addition to printing and embroidering apparel , Colorworks supplies businesses with mugs , mouse pads and other marketing items , and it warehouses and fills orders for online retailers . It shipped goods for the American Red Cross in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and in the summer of 2005 landed a large Medicare contract to distribute training literature for the government 's new prescription drug plan . <p> Taxes , even as they grew more complex as the business bought embroidery machines and other equipment to be depreciated , are no longer a headache to calculate , only to pay . <p> Looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to learn on the job such basics as the tax benefits provided by company vehicles . <p> He learned , for example , that it is better for the company to lease vehicles than to use personal ones and deduct the business mileage . ( There 's also not the bother of keeping a log . ) <p> " Our biggest mistake was probably not taking an accounting class or not hitting the community college for some kind of new-business workshop , " he said . " We just dove into it and then tried to figure it out . " ##
