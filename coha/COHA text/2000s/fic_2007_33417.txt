1 As a kid I was the youngest member of my family , and the youngest child in any family is always a jokemaker , because a joke is the only way he can enter into an adult conversation . My sister was five years older than I was , my brother was nine years older than I was , and my parents were both talkers . So at the dinner table when I was very young , I was boring to all those other people . They did not want to hear about the dumb childish news of my days . They wanted to talk about really important stuff that happened in high school or maybe in college or at work . So the only way I could get into a conversation was to say something funny . I think I must have done it accidentally at first , just accidentally made a pun that stopped the conversation , something of that sort . And then I found out that a joke was a way to break into an adult conversation . I grew up at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Depression . There were large numbers of absolutely top comedians on radio . And without intending to , I really studied them . I would listen to comedy at least an hour a night all through my youth , and I got very interested in what jokes were and how they worked . When I 'm being funny , I try not to offend . I do n't think much of what I 've done has been in really ghastly taste . I do n't think I have embarrassed many people , or distressed them . The only shocks I useare an occasional obscene word . Some things are n't funny . I ca n't imagine a humorous book or skit about Auschwitz , for instance . And it 's not possible for me to make a joke about the death of John F. Kennedy or Martin Luther King . Otherwise I ca n't think of any subject that I would steer away from , that I could do nothing with . Total catastrophes are terribly amusing , as Voltaire demonstrated . You know , the Lisbon earthquake is funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city before and then came out of an air-raid shelter and saw it afterward , and certainly one response was laughter . God knows , that 's the soul seeking some relief . Any subject is subject to laughter , and I suppose there was laughter of a very ghastly kind by victims in Auschwitz . Humor is an almost physiological response to fear . Freud said that humor is a response to frustration -- one of several . A dog , he said , when he ca n't get out a gate , will scratch and start digging and making meaningless gestures , perhaps growling or whatever , to deal with frustration or surprise or fear . And a great deal of laughter is induced by fear . I was working on a funny television series years ago . We were trying to put a show together that , as a basic principle , mentioned death in every episode and that this ingredient would make any laughter deeper without the audience 's realizing how we were inducing belly laughs . There is a superficial sort of laughter . Bob Hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a comedian with very thin stuff , never mentioning anything troubling . I used to laugh my head off at Laurel and Hardy . There is terrible tragedy there somehow . These men are too sweet to survive in this world and are in terrible danger all the time . They could be so easily killed . Even the simplest jokes are based on tiny twinges of fear , such as the question , " What is the white stuff in bird poop ? " The auditor , as though called upon to recite in school , is momentarily afraid of saying something stupid . When the auditor hears the answer , which is , " That 's bird poop , too , " he or she dispels the automatic fear with laughter . He or she has not been tested after all . " Why do firemen wear red suspenders ? " And " Why did they bury George Washington on the side of a hill ? " And on and on . True enough , there are such things as laughless jokes , what Freud called gallows humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is imaginable . While we were being bombed in Dresden , sitting in a cellar with our arms over our heads in case the ceiling fell , one soldier said as though he were a duchess in a mansion on a cold and rainy night , " I wonder what the poor people are doing tonight . " Nobody laughed , but we were still all glad he said it . At least we were still alive ! He proved it .
