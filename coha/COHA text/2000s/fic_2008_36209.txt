From the " Here 's Buzz " column in Star Gazer magazine , August 7 , 20  --  <br> The reason yours truly tips waiters so well is because they often tip me . And ey-yi-yi , sometimes they tip mucho grande ! ! Ladies and gents , boys and girls , we were recently handed a doozy of a document by one intrepid waiter who works poolside at an oh-so-swank Beverly Hills hotel . The Pentagon Papers helped bring down a president  --  maybe these purloined papers will help bring down a gadabout heiress who 's way too big for her size 4 bitches  --  oops !  --  I meant britches . <br> Here 's the scoop : As you loyal Star Gazer readers know , Caro Dixon has taken tippling to the nth degree , hitting the sauce like an Animal House frat pledge . Our accompanying photo album documents her in all phases of dress and undress , demonstrating why style and drunkenness so rarely coalesce . ( Is she doing on that yacht what I think it is she 's doing ? ) <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recuperative twelve steps ( rehab and plastic surgery clinics  --  home away from home for the oh so chic ) , our Miss Caro decided to skip a few steps and wrote ( or tried to write ) a letter of apology to those she 's hurt because of her overindulgence in martinis , margaritas , and Manhattans . Now this is where it gets good and why I would earn a Pulitzer were the nominating committee hip to stories the people really want to read . <br> One recent southern California afternoon , Caro Dixon , slathered in coconut oil , lay on a chaise longue , writing furiously on a legal pad . Our plucky waiter took note of her scribe work , especially when the redheaded mega-heiress ripped the paper out of the pad and lobbed it into a nearby potted palm . ( Let 's applaud her for trying to throw away her own trash  --  people of her ilk usually leave that job to the help . ) After she staggered out of the pool area , her towel dragging behind her like the train of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piqued , casually extracted the crumpled wad out of the potted palm . What follows , dear reader , is Caroline Dixon 's verbatim letter of " apology . " Mee-ow ! <br> Dear everyone I have ever supposedly hurt : <br> Silly me  --  I thought I was going to a party the other night at my " friend " Penny Englehart 's to celebrate her new body ( the boobs looked all right , although in my humble opinion , they could have tucked a little more tummy ) , only it turned out to be a gathering in celebration of a friend 's one-year anniversary of sobriety . Which of course meant no drinks . . . and no fun . <br> Mr. Clean told everyone how much his life had improved now that he 'd gone through rehab and followed " the program . " I said the only program I care to follow is America 's Top Model and only because I like to bet on the loser ! <br> He yammered on and on and I tried to listen , but could I help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Okay , so a week later I was in Biarritz , dancing with Andreas Stenapoulos , and I accidentally stepped on one of his two left feet and broke his toe . A couple days later I got caught peeing on Laird Wright 's musty old yacht ( note to his interior designer : is it my fault or yours that I mistook one of your decorative urns for a toilet ? ) , and then at Princess Marlena of Austria 's luncheon , I broke a teacup that Queen Victoria had given to her great-grandmother . She did not seem to find it helpful when I asked her if she 'd ever heard of superglue . Not even when I said , " Das superglue . " <br> Anyway , I realized that at all three of these events the common denominator was that I was plastered , and I thought , hmmm , should I forgo the deMarcos ' cruise invitation and book a vacation at Betty Ford 's instead ? Then I sobered up and thought , " Nahhhhhhh , where 's the fun in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a big thing in the " recovery program . " So here goes . To those I 've ever supposedly hurt : sorry . I did n't mean to do whatever it is that caused harm to you , but what can I say ? I was drunk ! <br> Besides , some of you deserve bigger apologies than I can give you . Penny  --  demand one from your plastic surgeon ! Gina  --  ask for an apology and a refund from your acting teacher . Brad Somerset  --  whoever 's responsible for your lousy personality , make them say they 're sorry ! My dear family  --  well , you 're exempted because I know you do n't believe in apologies , yours or anyone else 's ! <br> But I do , and in fact , I 'm sure that all of you are sorry for hurting me . If that 's the case , an apology will be taken into consideration . <br> Your friend , relative , employer , client , whatever , <br> Caro <br> Some show of sincere remorse , eh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks . Let 's send out to the poor little rich girl our best wishes for health and sobriety . Or not  --  why wish her something she obviously does n't want ? <br> Hudson &amp; Ashton Attorneys at Law Newport , Rhode Island <br> August 10 , 20  --  <br> Dear Miss Dixon , <br> On behalf of Mr. Bradley Somerset , I am writing to inform you that a restraining order and/or charges will be filed should you make any further contact with my client . <br> Mr. Somerset requests the return of the engagement ring through my office . <br> Sincerely , <br> Arthur Ashton Attorney at Law AA/ws <br> CAROLINE DIXON <br> 8/14/20  --  <br> Dear Arty , <br> Thanks for the day-brightener . I might have DTs , but your client has delusions if he thinks I ever considered that crappy piece of zircon an engagement ring . Give me a break  --  I 've found better rings around my tub . And believe me , Mr. Bradley Somerset does n't have to worry about any further contact from me  --  I 'm taking penicillin right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier contact with him . <br> Have a nice day suing people , <br> Caroline Dixon <br> August 14 , 20  --  <br> Dear Meg , <br> Thanks for listening so long last night . You alone know what a hard anniversary it is for me to mark . ( I can hear you now : " Then get out and make more friends to whom you can confide ! " ) I 'll take under advisement your suggestion to write the Kvitruds , but writing the letter is n't the problem . The problem is mailing it . <br> I look forward to your visit . Friends like you are treasures in this life of mine that is increasingly lonely . It 's funny  --  I chose to be alone as a buffer against getting hurt , but lately I am finding loneliness brings with it its own pain . <br> Now I know for certain I wo n't mail this note either ; I ca n't have you worried over what I 'm sure is a passing mood  --  made worse , I 'm certain , by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , a morning started without coffee is a morning not really started . <br> Love , Your whining friend , Astrid <br> 9:32 a.m . August 15 , 20  --  To : revbill@reacres.com From : dfarms@azlinx.com Subject : This weekend <br> Dear Rev : <br> Hope you 've settled into your new retirement digs without too much hassle . Are you still wearing your collar on the golf course ? No one would dare accuse you of cheating then . . . . <br> I 'd love to visit Hot Springs and check out the new place , but not necessarily your new " cute " neighbor , so I 'm going to take a rain check this weekend . I know it 's Bev more than you who tries to arrange these dates , but please , Bill , I 'd rather you find new ways to serve the Lord than my social life . <br> Anyway , Becky just foaled and I 'm not about to tear myself away from the fun of these next couple days . <br> Cyril <br> GILLIAN HEDGES <br> August 17 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled when your " letter " crossed the Atlantic and made an appearance in all the English papers ! And then , what an added thrill to see the accompanying photo montage ! How lovely to see Caroline ready to relieve herself on Laird 's yacht ! Oh , and look at Caroline coming out of Versace greeting the world with her middle finger ! And there she is photographed in a knock-down , drag-out fight in the lobby of the Bangkok Four Seasons with Gina Whelvan ! Need I tell you that all these thrills sent Mummy directly to her bed ? <br> When is it all supposed to end , Caroline ? When will you take " tormenting friends &amp; family " off your to-do list ? You 're long past using " youthful indiscretion " as an excuse . <br> Also , in your " heartfelt " apology , I did n't read any mention of you stealing my tennis bracelet or Garrett Tyson . But I suppose if you listed all your wrongdoings , it never would have been published because you 'd still be writing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <br> Gillian  --  <br> In my defense : <br> 1 . That urn looked an awful lot like a toilet . <br> 2 . You try to shop with thirty million Roman paparazzi surrounding you . <br> 3 . Gina Whelvan started it . She filmed a ninja movie this past spring and apparently likes to reenact scenes from it in hotel lobbies . <br> 4 . I 'm only twenty-six years old , hardly ready to cash in my pension , but then again , what would you know about youthful indiscretions ? You 've been a senior citizen since the day you were born . <br> 5 . I never stole your lousy tennis bracelet , and believe me , I did you a favor by stealing Garrett Tyson . Besides , I read his wife 's divorcing him , and if the prenup does n't hold up , maybe he 'll still have enough money for your taste . So go sic ' em , Gil ! <br> Tell my mother and your mummy thanks for the support , as usual . <br> C. <br> Continues ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
