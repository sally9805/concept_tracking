EDITOR 'S NOTE - They call it the Concow Incident , one of thousands of wildfires that blackened the West in 2000 . This is Part 1 of a five-day serial portraying courage in wildfire 's way . By DAVID FOSTER Associated Press Writer <p> CONCOW , Calif . ( AP ) - The house is gone . Anything that could burn was swallowed up in minutes that night , and a bulldozer later scraped away the rest : a forlorn chimney , shattered dishes , the skeleton of a kitchen stove . <p> Everything , gone . <p> But Darryl Sanford still sees it all . The fire captain stands in what used to be the front yard , staring up at the charred limbs of a big oak tree . <p> It 's his first time back since September , when wildfire unleashed itself across these hills and Sanford , trapped in a burning house surrounded by blazing trees , pulled off the narrowest of escapes . <p> He survived , yes , but he left someone behind . <p> " Every fireman 's dream is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To fail at that ... " <p> He did everything he could , and still the fire won . <p> Last year was America 's worst for wildfires since Yellowstone burned in 1988 . Fires blackened 7.4 million acres of forest and grassland , twice the annual norm , and killed 17 people in 13 states . Officials counted 92,250 separate fires . <p> This is the story of one of them , based on interviews with 35 firefighters , survivors and others , and on the findings of a government inquiry released Feb. 8 . <p> They call it the Concow Incident . Scorching some 1,800 acres in the Sierra Nevada foothills 80 miles north of Sacramento , it was not the year 's largest blaze . But it was one of the cruelest , and as things in California often are , it 's a sign of what 's to come <p> Throughout the arid West , civilization is spreading fast across a landscape meant to burn . As mansions and mobile homes sprout amid the pines , firefighters are drawn into a war that grows more dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they find , and people who live in wildfire 's way come to depend on you . Even when they should n't . <p> Tuesday 's newspapers lie on the brown lawns of Oroville . It is dawn , Sept. 19 , 2000 , the cloudless start of a sizzling day . <p> " A near-textbook recipe for disaster , " declares The Mercury-Register 's front-page story . " With temperatures and humidities like those expected today , a passionate look could constitute a fire hazard . " <p> Summer is having one last gasp in Butte County , where the farmland of the Central Valley rises into the dry , forested foothills of the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades . <p> By noon , the thermometer is closing in on 100 . Relative humidity is just 15 percent . Sun-baked oak and manzanita leaves rattle on branches , their water content a third of what it was in spring . <p> In this weather , the threat of fire is a constant presence , coiled in the weeds , ready to bound free with any spark : a horseshoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butt bouncing off the road . <p> For two days , the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has declared a Red Flag Warning , urging no use of lawn mowers or other outdoor equipment after 10 a.m . <p> But none of this deters Jim Stewart , age 71 . Under the noon sun , Stewart sits atop a bulldozer , clearing brush on his property in Concow , a rural , unincorporated community 15 miles north of Oroville . <p> Grinding toward his house , Stewart looks back at the gully where he 'd been working . Flames crackle in the brush . <p> Stewart powers the dozer back toward the fire , but it 's too late . Flames are scurrying up the steep ravine toward Concow Road , just above . <p> He rushes to the house and calls 911 . It is 1:04 p.m . <p> A minute later , buzzers and bells are sounding at CDF Fire stations throughout Butte County . From the start , it 's a high-level dispatch : six engines , two bulldozers , two air tankers , one helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They 'll hit this wildfire fast and hard , before it has a chance to spread . <p> Battalion Chief Wayne Wilson arrives at 1:20 , just behind the first engines , and finds a fire already displaying what he calls " an aggressive personality . " Some brush fires fuss and fume , their smoke drifting lazily . This one has a smoke column that billows a thousand feet high . <p> It would be hard to design a more troublesome place for a fire to start than this brush-choked ravine . Wildfires love to climb , and the terrain ahead is like a napkin tilted over a candle , rising 700 feet to Miller Peak , a mile to the east . <p> Amid the wail of sirens , Wilson calls for reinforcements : 10 more fire engines , two more air tankers , two more bulldozers . <p> He also orders six more fire crews with 90 firefighters in all . They are the Marines of the firefighting world , toiling along a fire 's flanks to etch out bare-earth corridors with chain saws , shovels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to contain the fire west of Concow Road , but his plan is obsolete as soon as he announces it . Flames are climbing into the tree tops and leaping across the road . In just 45 minutes , the fire has grown to 50 acres . <p> Air tankers swoop over the trees , at each pass dropping up to 1,800 gallons of water mixed with fire retardant and red dye . They can slow the fire 's spread but not stop it . <p> Wilson 's new plan : Use fire breaks to confine the blaze to a mile-wide corridor between two east-west roads - Pinkston Canyon Road along the southern edge , Deadwood Road to the north - then try to pinch off its head before it reaches Miller Peak . <p> It 's a time-tested strategy . You do n't stop wildfire so much as herd it , letting it exhaust itself within strips of land cleared of fuel by back fires , bulldozers and hand tools . <p> But with this blaze , as with many Western fires these days , there is a complication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush . Engine crews that once might have tagged along with fire crews , lending their hoses to wet down a fire 's flanks , now are ordered into a deadly zone once largely avoided . <p> As engines crowd onto narrow Concow Road , Wilson sends them up even narrower dirt roads along the ridge above the blaze . Each crew is to find a house , lay out hoses and wait for the fire to hit . <p> 2:40 p.m : CDF Fire Capt . Jeff Hawkins and Engineer Tony Brownell back their engines into the driveway of a mobile home off Tim Tam Lane , a gravel road traversing the ridge north of Miller Peak . <p> The fire , now covering 150 acres , churns toward them with the muffled roar of distant surf . It is a quarter-mile away and closing fast , blown by a 10-mph westerly wind . <p> While two firefighters from each truck lay hoses in the yard , Brownell and Hawkins size up the house . Brush has been cleared back 20 feet from the eaves . The law requires 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brownell and Hawkins agree . <p> The old man in the yard tells them he 's been here 40 years , and he 's not about to leave now . By law , residents can not be forced to evacuate , and this guy knows it . <p> Turn around and look , Brownell tells him . <p> Flames are clawing through the brush 200 yards away . Embers sail past . The homeowner , suddenly quiet , hurries his wife and dog into the car , and they roar off down the road . <p> Hawkins and Brownell return to their task . They have measured this situation against the cardinal rule of firefighting : No house is worth a life . And they 've reached the same conclusion as scores of other firefighters on this ridge today . They will stay . <p> The firefighters grab drip torches , metal canisters that dispense burning globs of oil and gasoline , and start laying down fire around the house . Their back fire chews through grass and weeds without leaping into trees above . Perfect , Brownell thinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will slow down the main fire when it hits . <p> And just in time . The fire is at hand . Flames sweep through 15-foot-high manzanita brush near the edge of the yard . Smoke hides the sun , and the roar increases from surf to freight train . Sparks and firebrands pelt the men . <p> It was already 103 degrees . Now heat billows from the flame front . Sweat and soot stream down bodies encased in long-sleeved Nomex shirts and pants , neck shrouds , goggles , helmets , heavy boots and leather gloves . <p> The firefighters move slowly , taking shallow breaths to keep from searing their throats . The four crew members occasionally turn their hose nozzles to the mist position and cool the air over their heads . Brownell and Hawkins , without hoses , crouch low every few seconds to grab a breath of less smoky air near the ground , then straighten up and move on . <p> The firefighters aim short bursts of water at burning brush near the house . There 's not a drop to waste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full bore would drain the tank in four minutes . <p> Flames melt through the home 's outside power line . A chicken coop and shed catch fire . But the house itself is clear of flame . And the fire front , though nastier than Hawkins and Brownell would prefer , is passing by . <p> Things are going well , Hawkins thinks . Then he looks back - his engine is on fire ! His crew rushes over , dousing the truck with its own hose , but not before plastic light covers melt . <p> And now the fire is making another run at them from a different angle . This is getting hairy , Hawkins thinks . They need help , fast . <p> He radios for air support , and within minutes hears the roar of an air tanker . He never sees the plane , but through clouds of smoke a red rain plummets . The soupy fire retardant smacks Hawkins , the house and the engine . A direct hit . <p> " Thank you ! " Hawkins shouts to the sky . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only beginning for Brownell and his crew . Worried that the wildfire will ambush them from a ridge to the south , they walk east along Tim Tam Lane , laying down fire along the road 's southern edge to burn out a safety zone . <p> Brownell , a brawny 6-feet-2 , has fought wildfires for 12 years . He 's known to colleagues as an aggressive firefighter , a quality that earns respect in the field but makes safety officers nervous . His two crew members are greener , but Brownell considers them sharp . Scott Martinez , 25 , has been with CDF Fire for four years . Eric Zane , 21 , is in his second season . <p> Their burn-out starts well , but 400 feet up the road , Brownell senses change . In roadside brush he 'd thought was clear , two spot fires are bubbling . And their back fire , until now simmering through the underbrush , is getting lively . Roadside pine trees ignite like torches . <p> Let 's get out of here , Brownell says . They drop their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Seconds later , their back fire leaps 40 feet into the sky . A wall of flame curls over them to become a fiery ceiling . Brownell looks one way up the road and then the other . It 's orange both ways . There 's nowhere to go . <p> " Deploy ! Deploy ! Deploy ! " Brownell shouts , dropping to his butt . <p> All three men reach for their fire shelters , aluminum and fiberglass blankets that firefighters call Shake ' N Bakes . Carried on the belt , they are tools of last resort , like the seat-cushion life preservers on an airliner . If you even start thinking you need one , you 're in deep trouble . <p> Firefighters train until they can remove a shelter from its 3-by-5-by-9-inch box , rip off its plastic wrapper , unfold it and spread it over themselves in 30 seconds . <p> Brownell figures they have 10 seconds before they start to fry . <p> Adrenaline surging , Brownell quells the urge to panic . In tight situations , you fall back on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Side by side , Brownell and Zane execute each step in sync . They 're on their backs , kicking open the accordion folds of their shelters , when they hear shouts from Martinez , a few feet behind them . <p> " I ca n't get it out ! " <p> Martinez has trained for shelter deployments . But that was on green grass . He has never seen a fire this close , this hot . It 's like being in an oven , with the door about to close . <p> His mind races . Take his gloves off ? His hands will burn . Run ? The fire is everywhere . Share a shelter with Zane or Brownell ? He 'd just read a book about a Colorado fire in which two men died trying to share one shelter . <p> He keeps fumbling . There . The shelter 's out of the box . But now he ca n't get the plastic off . The heat is unbearable . Brownell and Zane yell at him to hurry . <p> " I ca n't get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in Martinez ' voice , from frustration to terror . Without a word , he shuffles over and stretches his own shelter over Martinez . <p> Now he has Martinez ' head in his lap , but the younger firefighter 's legs are sticking out into the heat . Zane , spying the exposed legs , moves closer and shields them with his shelter . <p> Three big men . Two small shelters . This is not by the book . They should be on their bellies , faces in the dirt , hands and feet holding straps at each corner of each shelter to keep it firmly against the ground . <p> Instead , Brownell is sitting up , leaving a one-foot gap between the road and the edge of his shelter . Zane is on his back , his shelter riding up along the rear of his helmet . <p> All around them , the fire howls . Hot blasts of wind rattle the flimsy shelters , threatening to yank them from the men 's hands . It 's getting hard to breathe . Brownell can tell which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the shelter . He sees a tongue of flame lick in under one edge . <p> Then his left leg , pressed against superheated stone in the gravel road , begins to burn . <p> To be continued . <p> TOMORROW : Chaos in the hills . <p>  --  <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE - David Foster is the AP 's Northwest regional writer , based in Seattle . <p> End Adv for Sunday , Feb. 25 <p>
