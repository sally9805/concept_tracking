In the mid-1930s the editor Henry Luce was more than pleased with the way his magazine , TIME , was covering the world 's news . " Nevertheless , " he felt , " people are missing relatively more of what the camera can tell than of what the reporter writes . With more or less success they ' follow ' the news  --  i.e. , the written news . They scarcely realize how fascinating it can be to ' follow ' pictures  --  to be for the first time pictorially well-informed . " <P> Luce recorded those notions in " A Prospectus For A New Magazine . " He intended to call this imagined periodical SCOPE : THE SHOW-BOOK OF THE WORLD . For Rockefeller Center , at least , which today has no Time &; Scope Building at the corner of 50th Street and 6th Avenue , it 's a good thing that Luce and his colleague editors eventually settled upon LIFE  --  no subtitle , no embroidery . <P> " To see life ; to see the world ; to eyewitness great events ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud ... To see and to show is the mission now , for the first time , undertaken by a new kind of publication . " So Luce promised in his prospectus and so he delivered on Nov. 23 , 1936 , when the first sellout issue of LIFE kick-started a publishing phenomenon unlike any in the 20th century . For 64 years , in weekly and monthly editions as well as in specials and books , LIFE chronicled the world in pictures , proving time and again , even as video technologies exploded and our ideas of sensory experience expanded , that there was what Luce called " a dynamic power " in the still image . A photograph could command attention and demand contemplation  --  it could evoke or provoke an emotion  --  in a way that words , standing alone , simply could not . <P> As we see in Luce 's prospectus , LIFE was , from the very first , TIME 's sister . For decades they have shared rooms in their eponymous tower in Rock Center , and they have shared other things too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an instinct for lively , incisive journalism . They are not twins by any means ; they have always looked at things differently . But they have always understood one another well . <P> And now they go into business together . LIFE will carry on in the new century as a series of regularly published books and special-issue magazines . The issue in your hands , THE YEAR IN PICTURES 2000 , is the first brought to you by the editors of TIME , more than a couple of whom have served tours of duty at LIFE . ( There has been , through the years , a great deal of back and forth between the magazines , with managing editors , photographers , reporters and mailroom clerks shuttling between elevator banks and mastheads with regularity and ease . ) If the TIME sensibility informs the structure of the issue , we hope you will agree that the Life perspective  --  a picture really is worth a thousand words  --  flavors each page . <P> We wonder what the old boss , Luce , would have thought of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we are , to see his children stepping out together . <P>  --  The Editors
