Mama Dip , as she is known , is more than 6 feet tall , and her long legs stretch out into the late morning sun . The owner of Mama Dip 's Kitchen in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , is without pretension . You would never guess that she 's a best-selling cookbook author and a community role model .

" She even started her own version of Meals-On-Wheels in the 1970s-delivering hot packaged dinners around the neighborhood to the housebound , to those who could n't afford electricity , and to kids who had no adult supervision .

The menu , which includes fried chicken livers , corn pudding , stewed tomatoes , and chicken and dumplings , has n't changed much in years .

" Mama emphasizes the importance of listening to our children . " Not everyone can cook or be a doctor . There are wonderful jobs in between these two extremes . We need to ask children what they want and let them find the unique aspect of his or her talent . A child can feel inside what he wants to be . When I was 3 , I knew I wanted to cook . " About Happiness " We were dirt poor but did n't know it . Poor meant skinny in size , not economic . It was about survival-growing up , we had no notion of poverty . That 's modern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " I feel rich today , and when I hear people come to me and complain about their life or so and so who makes their life miserable , I say to them , ' You got shoes on your feet ? You got food to eat ? Then what are you complaining about ? ' " Mama sits back and rocks , full sunlight warming her skin and brightening her eyes . It 's almost lunchtime , and the dining room has filled with regular customers waiting for a kind word from Mama , a nod of complicity , and reassurance that home will always be here , at her table .
