Chapter One A SUDDEN BANGING ON THE FRONT DOOR sent a chill down my neck and into my chest . It was two thirty-nine in the morning . I was up and out of my bed immediately , though still more than half asleep . I had to go to the bathroom but the knocking was insistent ; seven quick raps , then a pause , and then seven more . It reminded me of something but I was too confused to remember what . " All right , " I called out . I considered staying quiet until the unwanted visitor gave up and left . But what if it was a thief ? Maybe he was knocking to see if there was anybody home . If I stayed quiet he might just break the two-dollar lock and come in on me . I 'm a small man , so even if he was just your run-of-the-mill sneak thief he might have broken my neck before realizing that Paris Minton 's Florence Avenue Book Shop did n't have any money in the cash box . I slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only way my little business could stay in the black . Selling used books does n't have a very high profit margin , except for the reading pleasure . Some days the only customers brought in books to sell or barter . Other days I was the only patron , reading Don Quixote , Their Eyes Were Watching God , or some other great novel from sunup to sundown . Mostly I sold westerns and mysteries and romances . But I rarely read those books . The women 's genre was n't written for a man 's sensibilities and popular men 's books were too violent . " Let me in there , Paris , " a voice I knew better than any other called out . " Fearless ? " " Yeah , man . Let me in . " I hesitated a moment and a moment more . " Paris . " I opened the door and Fearless Jones strode in , wearing a green suit with a white shirt , no tie , no hat , and dark shoes . The tip of the baby finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gunfight that almost got us both killed , and he had the slightest limp from a knife wound he 'd received saving my life in San Francisco many years before . Fearless was tall and dark , thin and handsome , but mostly he was powerful . He was stronger than any man I 'd ever known , and his will was indomitable . Fearless was n't a smart man . A twelve-year-old might have been a better reader , but if he ever looked into your eyes he would know more about your character than any psychiatrist , detective , or priest . " I 'm in trouble , Paris , " we said together . Fearless grinned but I did n't . " I got to go to the toilet , " I said . I walked back through one of the two aisles of bookshelves that made up my store . Fearless followed me into the toilet , unashamed and still talking while I relieved myself in the commode . " It was a woman named Leora Hartman , " he was saying . " She came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah ? " I said . " What about her ? " " You know her ? " Fearless asked . " No . " " Oh , " he said on a sigh , and I knew I was in deep trouble . Fearless never hesitated unless he knew that he was going to cause problems for someone he cared for . And that someone was almost always me . I was washing my hands by the time he said , " She 's a good-lookin ' woman-Leora . And that little boy was so cute . " " What little boy ? " " She said his name was Son . That 's what she said . But come to think of it , that must'a been his name , because even though I think he was part of a tall tale , he was just a child and a child do n't know how to lie about his name . " We walked back to the front room of the bookshop . The space up there was furnished with a card table that had three chairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wood chairs . " Leora is a pretty woman , " Fearless said , following in my wake like a bullet coming after a moth . " Talked like she had some education , you know ? And she was refined . " " What you mean by that ? " I asked . I had learned over the years that even though Fearless and I spoke the same tongue his limited use of language was often more subtle than my own . " I do n't know really , " he said with a frown . " She looked like just a regular girl , but there was somethin ' that set her apart too . That 's why , that 's why I did n't think it would hurt to help her out . " " Fearless , what are you talking about ? " " Leora come up to me with this cryin ' three-year-old boy named Son . She told me that his father had left her and that her and Son was in the street on account'a he done taken all her savings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue ? " " She said that Son 's father is a man named Kit Mitchell . Kit 's a farmer from Wayne , Texas . I been workin ' for him the last month or so . " " The Watermelon Man ? " " That 's him . " Fearless and I received thirteen thousand dollars apiece after we were involved in the shootout that maimed his baby finger . With my money I bought and refurbished a building that had been a barber 's shop . When I was through I had a new used book store . I also bought a used Ford sedan and put a few hundred dollars in the bank with a solid two percent interest rate . Fearless got houses for his sister and mother at thirty-five hundred dollars a go , bought a fancy car , and spent the rest on a good time that lasted about three months . After that he sold his car to pay the rent and took on a job for a man selling counterfeit Texas watermelons . Counterfeit , inasmuch as they came from the seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown in Oxnard on the leased farm of a man I only knew by the title of the Watermelon Man . The Watermelon Man hired Fearless to harvest his melons and put them on trucks that he had fitted with Texas license plates . Then he would send his fleet of six trucks into Watts , where they would sell the giant fruit on street corners , telling everybody that they were getting genuine Texas melons . Texans believe that the best food in the world is from down home , and so they spent the extra nickel for this prime commodity . " So the woman was the Watermelon Man 's wife ? " I asked . " That 's what she said . She was his wife and the boy was his son . The whole time we talked , Son was cryin ' that he wanted his daddy . You know he cried so hard that it almost broke my heart . " " When did you meet her ? " I asked . " I just told you-the other day . " " You never saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even know that he was married . " " So then how 'd you know that she really was his wife ? " I asked , wondering at the endless gullibility of the deadliest man in L.A. " Why she wan na lie to me ? " Fearless replied . " I did n't even know the lady . " " Maybe because she wanted to find Kit for some other reason , " I suggested . " Maybe he owed somebody some money , maybe he 's in a jam . " " Yeah . " Fearless ducked his head . " Yeah , you right , Paris . Maybe so . But when I saw her and heard that boy cryin ' , I was just so sure that she was the one in trouble . " " And she wanted you to bring her man back ? " I asked , worrying about what my deadly friend might have done . " No , " Fearless said . " All she wanted was to know if I knew where to find him . " " And did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed her story . " That was when I should have stood up and shown Fearless the door . I should have said , No more , brother . I have to get back to sleep . That 's because I knew whatever it was he saw in her story was going to bite me on the backside before we were through . " Why ? " I asked beyond all reason . " Because Kit had n't shown up to work at the gardens on Monday . He was n't there Tuesday neither . His drivers all came but he never showed . I was n't surprised . The last couple'a days out there he kept talkin ' about some big deal he had and how he was gon na make a whole room full'a money . " " Doing what ? " Fearless shook his head . " Did anybody call him after he did n't show up ? " I asked . " Nobody knew his number . And we really did n't need him . You know I was the one loaded the trucks anyway . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off those melons like they was real Texas . When he did n't come in on Wednesday I called it quits . " " And when did Leora come to you ? " " Day before yesterday . " It was Monday morning , so I asked , " Saturday ? " " No ... I mean yeah . " " You want some coffee , Fearless ? " He smiled then , because coffee was the signal that meant I was going to hear him out . ( Continues ... )
