It 's not a homeownership plan the government will be keen to promote . Two illegal immigrants from El Salvador took possession last week of a 70-acre Arizona ranch as part of a civil judgment against a vigilante leader who allegedly threatened them with a gun when he caught them sneaking into the U.S. in March 2003 . The immigrants said the ordeal left them with posttraumatic stress , a condition that seems to be spreading fast on the Mexico-U.S. boundary .

That bill is backed by many Democrats , but the AFL-CIO is withholding support . <P> The White House has yet to indicate a preference , but a number of Republican Congressmen have told the Administration that stronger enforcement is their top priority . House majority leader Tom DeLay says President Bush has admitted recently in private talks that he made a mistake in how he approached the issue at the start of the year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossings , even as he pushes for a guest-worker program .
