Gideon 's Gift A Novel By Karen Kingsbury Warner Books Karen Kingsbury Chapter One The red gloves were all that mattered . If living on the streets of Portland was a prison , the red gloves were the key . The key that - for a few brief hours - set him free from the lingering stench and hopeless isolation , free from the relentless rain and the tarp-covered shanty . The key that freed him to relive the life he 'd once had . A life he could never have again . Something about the red gloves took him back and made it all real - their voices , their touch , their warmth as they sat with him around the dinner table each night . Their love . It was as though he 'd never lost a bit of it . As long as he wore the gloves . Otherwise , the prison would have been unbearable . Because the truth was Earl had lost everything . His life , his hope , his will to live . But when he slipped on the gloves ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers , Earl still had the one thing that mattered . He still had a family . If only for a few dark hours . It was the first of November , and the gloves were put away , hidden in the lining of his damp parka . Earl never wore them until after dinner , when he was tucked beneath his plastic roof , anxious to rid himself of another day . He would 've loved to wear them all the time , but he did n't dare . They were nice gloves . Handmade . The kind most street peoplewould snatch from a corpse . Dead or alive , Earl had no intention of losing them . He shuffled along Martin Luther King Boulevard , staring at the faces that sped past him . He was invisible to them . Completely invisible . He 'd figured that much out his first year on the streets . Oh , once in a while they 'd toss him a quarter or shout at him : " Get a job , old man ! " or " Go back to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who passed him were still in the race , still making decisions and meeting deadlines , still believing it could never happen to them . They carried themselves with a sense of self-reliance - a certainty that they were somehow better than him . For most of them , Earl was little more than a nuisance . An unsightly blemish on the streets of their nice city . Rain began to fall . Small , icy droplets found their way through his hooded parka and danced across his balding head . He did n't mind . He was used to the rain ; it fit his mood . The longer he was on the street the more true that became . He moved along . " Big Earl ! " The slurred words carried over the traffic . Earl looked up . A black man was weaving along the opposite sidewalk , shouting and waving a bottle of Crown Royal . He was headed for the same place as Earl : the mission . Rain or shine , there were meals at the mission . All the street people knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred times before , but he could n't remember his name . Could n't remember most of their names . They did n't matter to him . Nothing did . Nothing except the red gloves . The black man waved the bottle again and shot him a toothless grin . " God loves ya , Big Earl ! " Earl looked away . " Leave me alone , " he muttered , and pulled his parka tighter around his neck and face . The mission director had given him the coat two years ago . It had served its purpose . The dark-green nylon was brown now , putrid-smelling and sticky with dirt . Earl 's whiskers caught in the fibers and made his face itch . He could n't remember the last time he 'd shaved . Across the street the black man gave up . He raised his bottle to a group of three animated women with fancy clothes and new umbrellas . " Dinner bell 's a callin ' me home , ladies ! " The women stopped chatting and formed a tight , nervous cluster . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as they could . After they 'd passed , the black man raised his bottle again . " God loves ya ! " The mission was two blocks up on the right . Behind him , Earl could hear the black man singing , his words running together like gutter water . Earl 's cool response had n't bothered him at all . " Amazing grace , how sweet da sound ... " Earl narrowed his gaze . Street people wore thick skins . Layers , Earl called it - years of living so far deep inside yourself , nothing could really touch you . Not the weather , not the nervous stares from passersby , not the callous comments from the occasional motorist . And certainly not anything another street person might say or do . The mission doors were open . A hapless stream of people mingled among the regulars . Earl rolled his eyes and stared at his boots . When temperatures dropped below fifty , indigents flooded the place . The regulars could barely get a table . He squeezed his way past the milling newcomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line started and the quickest way to get a hot plate . Up ahead were two empty-eyed drifters - young guys with long hair and years of drug use written on their faces . Earl slid between them , grabbed a plate of food , and headed for his table , a forgotten two-seater off by itself in the far corner of the room . " Hey , Earl . " He looked up and saw D. J. Grange , mission director for the past decade . The man was bundled in his redplaid jacket , same as always . His eyes were blue . Too blue . And piercing . As though he could see things Earl did n't tell anyone . D. J. was always talking God this and God that . It was amazing , really . After all these years , D. J. still did n't get it . Earl looked back down at his plate . " I do n't come for a sermon . You know that , " he mumbled into his instant mashed potatoes . " We got people praying , Earl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earl could feel the man 's smile without looking . " Any requests ? Just between us ? " " Yes . " Earl set his fork down and shot D. J. the hardest look he could muster . " Leave me alone . " " Fine . " D. J. grinned like a shopping-mall Santa Claus . " Let me know if you change your mind . " Still smiling , he moved on to the next table . There was one other chair at Earl 's table , but no one took it . There was an unspoken code among street people - sober ones , anyway : " Eyes cast down , do n't come around . " Earl kept his eyes on his plate , and on this night the code worked . The others would rather stand than share a meal with a man who needed his space . Besides his appearance would easily detract even the most hardened street people . He did n't look in the mirror often , but when he did , he understood why they kept their distance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parka . It was his eyes . Cold , dead eyes . The only time he figured his eyes might possibly show signs of life or loneliness was at night . When he wore the red gloves . But then , no one ever saw his eyes during those hours . He finished his plate , pushed back from the table and headed for the exit . D. J. watched him go , standing guard at the front of the food line . " See you tomorrow , Earl . " He waved big . " I 'll be praying for you . " Earl did n't turn around . He walked hard and fast out the door into the dark , rainy night . It was colder than before . It worried him a little . Some years , when the first cold night had hit , another street person had swiped his bed or taken off with his tarp . His current tarp hung like a curtain across the outside wall of his home . It was easily the most important part of his physical survival . Small wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked up his pace . His back hurt and he felt more miserable than usual . He was anxious for sleep , anxious to shut out the world and everything bad about it . Anxious for the red gloves . He 'd spent this day like every other day , wandering the alleyways and staring at his feet . He always took his meals at the mission and waited . For sundown , for sleep , for death . Years ago , when he 'd first hit the streets , his emotions had been closer to the surface . Sorrow and grief and guilt , fear and loneliness and anxiety . Hourly these would seize him , strangling his battered heart like a vice grip . But each day on the streets had built in him another layer , separating him from everything he 'd ever felt , everything about the man he used to be and the life he used to lead . His emotions were buried deep now , and Earl was sure they 'd never surface again . He was a shell - a meaningless , unfeeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rounded the corner and through the wet darkness he saw his home . It was barely noticeable , tucked beneath an old wrought-iron stairwell deep in the heart of a forgotten alley . Hanging from seven rusty bolts along the underside of the stairs was the plastic tarp . He lifted the bottom of it off the ground and crawled inside . No matter how wet it was , rain almost never found its way beyond the tarp . His pillow and pile of old blankets were still dry . He 'd been waiting for this moment all day . His fingers found the zipper in the lining of his parka and lowered it several inches . He tucked his hand inside and found them , right where he 'd left them this morning . As soon as he made contact with the soft wool , the layers began to fall away , exposing what was left of his heart . Carefully he pulled the gloves out and slipped them onto his fingers , one at a time . He stared at them , studied them , remembering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did something that had become part of his routine , something he did every night at this time . He brought his hands to his face and kissed first one woolen palm and then the other . " Good night , girls . " He muttered the words out loud . Then he lay down and covered himself with the tattered blankets . When he was buried far beneath , when the warmth of his body had served to sufficiently warm the place where he slept , he laced his gloved fingers together and drifted off to sleep . The next morning he was still half given to a wonderful dream when he felt rain on his face . Rain and a stream of light much brighter than usual . With eyes closed , he turned his head from side to side . What was it ? Where was the water coming from and why was n't his tarp working ? He rubbed his fingers together - - nd sat straight up . " No ! " His voice ricocheted off the brick walls of the empty alley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he could - a gut-wrenching , painful cry of the type he had n't uttered since that awful afternoon five years ago . His head was spinning . He grabbed at his hair , pulled it until his scalp hurt . It was n't possible . Yet ... He 'd been robbed . In the middle of the night someone had found him sleeping and taken most of what made up his home . His tarp was gone . Most of his blankets , too . But that was n't all . They had stolen everything left of his will to live , everything he had to look forward to . Nothing this bad had happened to him since he took to the streets . He shook his head in absolute misery as a driving rain pelted his skin , washing away all that remained of his sleep . He stared at his hands , his body trembling . The thing he 'd feared most of all had finally happened . The red gloves were gone . ( Continues ... )          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
