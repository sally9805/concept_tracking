1 Michael Vaughn would never have admitted it , but sometimes he still felt beyond cool when he walked into Central Intelligence Agency headquarters . He 'd step across the CIA seal on the floor in the center of the lobby , his head held a bit higher than usual , a casual smile on his chiseled face , and think , Check me out . I 'm a CIA agent . Yeah , that 's right , I 'm a badass . Then he 'd laugh at himself and try to keep a straight face until he got past security . This was n't CIA agent behavior , he knew . It was n't even adult behavior . But he could n't help it . It had started back when he 'd reported for training at the Farm . That first day it had hit him : He was finally fulfilling his lifelong dream to be one of the good guys , to protect the United States and its citizens from all threats , foreign or domestic . That day he 'd gotten a sort of adrenaline-fueled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he still felt it . He was cool . James Bond cool . Han Solo cool . He was the guy every other guy wished he could be . On this warm spring day , Vaughn was feeling his cool factor more intensely than usual . He and his new partner , Chloe Murphy , had just returned from a mission in the Middle East -- a dangerous , confidential , top-priority mission -- and they had returned home triumphant . Not only had they taken out a powerful terrorist cell , but they had secured two warehouses full of illegal weapons . This morning , Vaughn was feeling good . He was feeling like a hero . Chloe had been one of his fellow trainees at the Farm . After his first partner , Akiko Schwartz , had opted for a desk job at the CIA 's Center for Families , he 'd been reassigned to team with Chloe , ababy-faced wunderkind with a Ph.D . in linguistics who 'd just come back from a stint in Paris . He nodded to Rufus and Tom , the two guards outside the secure room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Outer Rim was the nickname the agents had given to the long , white hallway that surrounded the offices of the CIA . Vaughn placed his palm on the handprint scanner in the secure room and waited as a beam of light illuminated his skin . His picture appeared on the security screen along with his clearance code and status : active . " State your name , " a female voice said , filling the small room . " Michael Vaughn . " The voice-recognition computer beeped its approval . The glass door in front of Vaughn slid open , and he stepped into the Outer Rim . Brightly lit and deathly quiet , the Rim smelled of antiseptic cleaner that always reminded Vaughn of hospitals . He walked across the gleaming linoleum floor and stood before the door to the bullpen-style office within . As always , he strained not to blink as the red laser for the retinal scan slid over his eyeball . Finally the steel door before him unlocked , and Vaughn pushed his way inside . The office , as always , was buzzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into headsets . Three senior agents huddled over a flat-screen monitor , urgently whispering over some new intel . Phones trilled and printers whined . Vaughn headed for the far side of the room , where he and his fellow junior agents sat in a cluster of six desks , set up so that each agent faced his or her partner . Chloe was already at her desk , her long brown hair held back in a messy bun with two pencils . She sipped a huge cup of coffee , her eyes trained on her monitor . " ' Morning , " Vaughn said , sliding into his leather chair . Chloe glanced up and smiled , her hazel eyes glittering . " We are so money right now . " " Yeah ? Everyone 's heard ? " Vaughn asked , leaning back and unbuttoning his suit jacket . Chloe spotted someone over his shoulder and lifted her chin with a smile . " Vaughn , my man ! " Agent Chris Seale called out , holding up his hand to slap palms with Vaughn . Chris was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be straining to break free from his pressed shirts and too-tight ties . Vaughn stood up to give him a high five , and Chris almost knocked him off his feet . " It 's all over the office , " Chris said , sitting down at his desk next to Vaughn 's , his huge form practically overflowing from the chair . Vaughn scratched at the back of his scruffy light brown hair , grinning with pride . This was exactly how he 'd pictured it all the way home on the long flight from Cairo to Paris to Boston to D.C. Back-slapping , congratulations , general adulation . He was sure his and Chloe 's success in the Middle East was going to land them a prime assignment their next time out . Something even bigger , even more treacherous and significant . He could n't wait to find out what it would be . " Hey , Vaughn , Murphy . Betty wants to see you in her office , " Jordan Patel , another of their peers , told them as he dropped into his own chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his computer . No " Welcome home . " No " Good job . " Not that Vaughn was surprised . Patel was one of those people who could n't stand it when others succeeded -- even if they were all on the same team . Vaughn met Chloe 's gaze as they stood up , and he could tell she was as excited as he was to talk to their boss . This was it . Betty was sure to reward their success with a fabulous assignment . " What do you think it 'll be ? " Chloe asked under her breath as she fell into step next to Vaughn . They wound their way around the clusters of desks , acknowledging a few more congratulations as they went . " I do n't know , " Vaughn told her , his heart pounding . " Russia . . . China . . . Indonesia . . . ? " He held open the door to Betty Harlow 's office for Chloe . As they stepped into the soundproof room , Betty reached for her cane , using it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in charge of training at the Farm when Vaughn and Chloe were there learning the skills that would turn them into ace officers . Back then they had been petrified of her . They were still scared , in fact , but to a lesser degree . Betty reminded Vaughn of an aging folk singer , with long graying brown hair and a no-nonsense attitude . She was in charge , and everyone around her knew it by her very presence . But after everything Vaughn had been through with her , he 'd grown to respect and admire her -- even if that one heavy-lidded eye still appeared in his nightmares now and then . " Nice work in the desert , " Betty said , nodding to the visitors ' chairs across from her . " Thank you , ma'am , " Vaughn and Chloe said in unison before perching on the edge of their seats . Betty lowered herself into her chair again and passed them each a folder marked confidential .
