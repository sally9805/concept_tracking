Peter In early August , after her best friend Andromeda had gone to Europe , Miranda met a boy in the woods . She knew who he was . His name was Peter Gross . They had no friends in common , though their high school was a small one . Miranda was a good student , popular and well liked . Peter Gross was none of those things . He had curly brown hair , crooked teeth , tanned skin . Because of a birth defect , he was missing his right hand , most of his right forearm . Miranda had been aware of him for years . But she spoke to him for the first time at the ice house , which was a ruined cottage next to a little stone dam in a few wooded acres between the college and the golf course . It was a place she visited occasionally , a small stone building half hidden in the oleander bushes . It had a wooden roof that had fallen in . She used to go there to read books , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him in her secret place . Almost she crept back to her bike and rode away . Then she thought she 'd wait for him to leave . Then she got interested in watching him ; he had built a weir under the dam with a piece of plywood to make a larger pool . He had made a sluice gate for the water to escape , and he squatted on the dam to catch minnows and frogs . His hand was quick in thewater . She stood under the willow trees while he caught a frog and let it go . After a few minutes she could tell by a kind of stiffness in his shoulders that he was aware she was watching him . Then she was too embarrassed not to go and sit beside him and scratch her sunburned legs . She thought he might be grateful for some companionship . He probably did n't know many people . But he was intent on the water and he scarcely looked up . " Hey , " she said . " Hey . " What did they talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miranda had read in the newspaper about his mother 's death maybe a year before . Andromeda had mentioned something about it , too -- -Peter 's mother had been a secretary in the English department at the college where everyone 's parents worked , and where Stanley taught astronomy . Knowing about her death made Peter easier to talk to for some reason , although Miranda felt she had to tread lightly when she mentioned her own family . That summer she was having some problems at home . One afternoon in the middle of the month , she showed up at the ice house a little late . Everything she ever did was wrong , she said , and there was no part of her life that Rachel did n't want to supervise . She had no privacy . She 'd got home and her shoes were lined up under the bed , even though she 'd asked Rachel not to go into her room . Worse than that , the computer was on , though she was almost sure she had n't touched it . Maybe she had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her passwords . Sitting on the dam , pulling at a loose piece of rubber on her sneaker , she said , " I feel as though my life is n't my life . My house is n't my house , and my parents are n't my parents . Which they 're not , of course . " Peter was chewing on a long piece of grass , a habit of his . " What do you mean ? " She sat cross-legged and examined a scratch on her knee . " I guess when Rachel and I fight , sometimes I look at her and think , ' You 're not my real mother . My real mother is somewhere in Romania . ' " " Why Romania ? " " Because that 's where she is . " And then she told him about having been adopted from the orphanage in Constanta . She kicked her foot over the edge of the dam . " It 's on the Black Sea . Have you heard of it ? " Peter shrugged . The stream under the dam was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped back and forth over a bed of dry mud . " I know a poem about Romania . " His mind was full of scraps of poetry that his mother had taught him . Already he had given her some recitations . " ' Oh , life is a marvelous cycle of song , ' " he now quoted , and then a few lines more . This was very annoying , even though she found herself smiling . " Hey , shut up , " she said , because he was n't taking her seriously . " Sometimes I feel like crying the whole time , " she said , which was an exaggeration . Peter was looking up the slope on the other side of the stream , squinting , not paying attention , it seemed like . Now he turned toward her . He was interested in things like tears or anger , she thought . " Why ? " he asked . " Sometimes it 's just that word . Romania . It makes my stomach turn . " She was deeper into the conversation than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about some of these things . But now she felt she had to continue , because of the stupid poem . " I was three years old . I have these pictures in my mind , but I ca n't tell what 's real , what 's made up . There 's a woman I call my aunt . There 's a journey on a train . There 's a man and he 's talking to me , trying to make me do something I do n't want . There 's a cottage with a tin roof , and he 's talking to me from the terrace above the beach . There 's a stone castle with a steeple -- -it 's like a postcard in my mind . There 's a little room overlooking the sea . " Rachel and Stanley had found her in Constanta . They 'd told her how her family had disappeared during the uprising against Nicolae Ceausescu , the dictator who had destroyed her country . But then who was the woman in the picture ? She had coarse skin , gray hair , dark eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and she was dressed with great elegance in furs . It was wintertime and she looked cold . But the smile on her frosted lips was full of love . " God damn it , " Miranda said . Peter had wedged the stem of grass between his two front teeth , and he was smiling . " Go on , " he said . " God damn you . " Miranda blushed . To her surprise , her face was hot , and some tears were moving down her cheeks . Was this a real emotion ? She could n't tell . Peter looked away . " I 'm not sure I believe you , " he said . " I think you 're trying to make a fool of me . " " What do you mean ? " " Everyone feels as if they 're from some foreign place . Or another planet . That does n't mean they are . " She scratched her nose . " Yeah , " she said . " I guess you 're right . " A few minutes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now she was furious and she did n't show it . Who was Peter Gross to condescend to her ? Though he was older , he 'd never acted like it before . She looked down the stream , where it disappeared in a tangle of broken willows . She did n't look at him , though she could tell he was watching her . Then she stood up . " I 've got to go , " she said . " Rachel wants to take me shopping before school starts . " He had a piece of grass stuck through his teeth . " I 'm sorry if I offended you , " he said . " Hey , no problem . You 're right . " " Will you be here tomorrow ? " She shrugged . " I 've got some things to do . " Though she stood for a while scuffing her feet , she was anxious to go . And when she bicycled away , up the dirt road behind the grounds department shed , she wondered why she ever should come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove anything to Peter Gross . But maybe she did , because the next day she snuck into her parents ' room and found the box of her Romanian things on the top shelf of the closet . In the afternoon she loaded them into her leather backpack and rode out to the ice house . For a minute or so , she and Peter sat listening to a bunch of birds . Then : " Let 's see , " he said . She took her time . The house had a wide stone step , and the first thing she did was brush it clean with the edge of her palm . Then she opened her backpack and took out a fringed , gray velvet shawl , which she unfolded and laid over the stone step . Next she took out a manila envelope and a beaded black purse . The envelope contained a leather-bound book with gilt-edged pages , very thin , almost transparent . " Onionskin , " she told him . There 'd been a time in her life when she 'd looked at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she 'd touched it . Still , she found she remembered everything as she opened the book , the mysterious foreign words , the penciled inscription opposite the frontispiece -- -a hand-colored , photographic portrait of Carol I , king of Romania . His hawk-faced , bearded profile was extremely clear . You could see the grizzled hair along his neck . " It 's called The Essential History , " she said . " But I ca n't read Romanian . Stanley says that when they found me in the orphanage , I could barely speak . I was still in a crib . When I go to college , I 'll learn it all again . " She placed the book carefully on the gray velvet . She allowed it to open to where the marker was , a ribbon maybe halfway through . Then she was drawing her things one by one out of the beaded purse . Most were wrapped in Kleenex , and she was uncovering them and laying them out according to her remembered ritual . First , a silver cigarette lighter , decorated and engraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a silver locket on a silver chain . Opened , it revealed two sepia faces , a woman and a child . Third , fourth , fifth , and sixth were all coins -- -big , solid , heavy , ancient , gold . And then a smaller silver one , which Stanley once had managed to identify in a book from the library . It was a Greek drachma , they 'd decided , two thousand years old , and stamped with the head of Alexander the Great . Romania had been conquered by the Romans in the second century . But even before that , Constanta had been a Greek town . As Miranda unwrapped the last of her things , she caught a remnant of a fantasy from long ago when she was small , an image of herself as a princess standing on the shore of the Black Sea , the warm water lapping the toes of her riding boots . From the terrace of the castle she had walked down to the beach . Someone was above her on the parapet -- -was it that man de Graz ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching her ?
