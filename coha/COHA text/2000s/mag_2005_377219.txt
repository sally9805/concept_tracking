DIED . PHILIP JOHNSON , 98 ; in New Canaan , Conn . One of the nation 's best-known architects and architectural tastemakers , he was also one of the great American enthusiasts . As co-organizer of the pivotal 1932 International Style exhibition at New York City 's Museum of Modern Art , he introduced the U.S. to the European glass-and-steel modernism that would dominate its skylines after World War II . As an architect he produced some fine work in the modernist vein , like his own Glass House . But modernism 's refusal of historical reference made him restless . In 1984 , with his Chippendale-topped AT &T; building in Manhattan , he proclaimed himself postmodern . He was capable of very good buildings , like Pennzoil Place in Houston , and mere concoctions , like so many of his later-life office towers . And for a while in the 1930s his enthusiasms included fascism , a nasty episode of which he later repented . In a long , nimble career , his only constant was change .  --  By Richard Lacayo <P> CHARGED .

ROSE MARY WOODS , 87 , doggedly loyal secretary to President Richard Nixon who famously took part of the blame for an 181/2-min. gap in a tape recording of a conversation between Nixon and his chief of staff , H.R. Haldeman , made three days after the Watergate break-in ; in Alliance , Ohio . Woods said that while transcribing the June 20 , 1972 , recording  --  which was considered critical because it might have shown that Nixon knew in advance about the break-in and was involved in a coverup  --  she could have erased part of the tape by accidentally hitting the erase key while reaching for her phone .
