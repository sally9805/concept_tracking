" Is everyone all right ? " Colonel Drake asked . <p> Morgan looked back at Taylor Lee , sliding fully behind the steering wheel in the boat . She shot Morgan a thumbs-up , and she relayed to Home Base . " We 're fine , Commander . " <p> Sally Drake had been as nervous as the rest of them about the S.A.T . team penetrating to pull an interception , but when orders to activate the S.A.T . had come down from Secretary of Defense Reynolds himself and he 'd explained the urgency and stakes , she 'd had no choice but to execute them . Neither had Morgan . <p> " Good , " Commander Drake said , clearly relieved , and then addressed Jazie in the Apache . " Position note , twelve-point-one miles , " she said , and then reeled off the GPS coordinates , making them a part of the official record . " Zone compliance is verified . Move in , 248 . Guardian Two , position and prepare to board the vessel . " <p> Morgan closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the water and up the stern 's metal ladder , primed to fire on any opposition . Intel had reported the target as traveling solo . Word he 'd left behind was that he 'd been storing it for his brother , Bruce , while Bruce had been serving in Iraq . Now Bruce was back in Magnolia Beach , Florida . Time to return the boat . The story checked out , so far as it went , but mistakes happened in the shadowy intelligence realm , and Morgan was n't ready to assume the traveling-solo report was also accurate and land herself and her team on some killed-in-action statistics list . <p> The target lay face down , sprawled on the deck . His arms were extended , his face turned toward her . The tranquilizer was potent and should have taken effect within seconds after he had been hit , but drop-dead gorgeous was also drop-dead deadly . Extreme caution was not only warranted , but to ensure her team 's survival , it was required . Her finger on the trigger , Morgan hung back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intently for any signs of movement . Seeing none , she inched closer ... <p> Lightning flashed . He sprang to his feet and lunged at her . <p> Adrenaline shoved through her veins . Her heart pounded in her ears . She feinted left , dropped and rolled , swung her gun up , and looked into his eyes . Ice-cold . Riddled with rage . Instinctively , she recoiled , squeezed the trigger , and fired again . <p> Caught full in the chest , he flew backward off his feet . His head clipped the steering console , and he crashed hard , hitting the deck with a dull thud . <p> The impact should n't have been significant enough to take him off his feet . Morgan glanced down ; he must have slipped on the wet deck . <p> Regardless , this time , he was lights out and staying down . <p> Rattled , Morgan blew out a held breath , settled down enough to get her heart back into her chest where it belonged , and then transmitted her report . " Target was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to keep the tremor out of her voice . " But he 's down now . " <p> Taylor Lee hit the throttle and sped across the water in their boat , quickly closing the distance between her and the yacht . She tied off on the Sunrise and then climbed aboard and joined Morgan on deck . Confirming with a quick look that the man was down and out cold , Taylor grunted . " Missed him the first time , eh ? " <p> " You think ? " Morgan glared at her . He 'd come close to knocking her on her ass , and while she was decent at defending herself , she was n't foolish enough to believe for a second she could take him one-on-one . He was n't using it in his current job , but he 'd had the same training she 'd had plus a lot more , and he had size , reach , weight , and strength on his side . He 'd have pulverized her within seconds . Yet none of that bothered her as much as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would have sworn she had caught the man in the neck . She 'd have bet her life on it , in fact , and being wrong right now , when she already felt under-qualified for the mission and on shaky ground , played hell with her confidence . Could she trust her judgment at identifying the target by intuition when she could n't trust that same intuition on a simple shot she had fired at the man ? <p> Taylor squatted beside him and patted him down . " No weapons . " <p> " Means nothing . " He either had n't expected trouble or wanted to appear as though he had n't . <p> She looked over and up at Morgan . " You searched the vessel yet ? " <p> " Not yet . " Hell , she had barely recovered from the near miss , and she was n't at all sure that if she tried to move now her legs would hold her . As far as she was concerned , the regular S.A.S.S. operatives could keep their jobs and the anxiety that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her tamer psych consults . Her team rarely worked directly with individual opponents , just offered profiles or insights usually . And exposure was n't nearly so dramatic or stressful when the subjects were on your side . <p> The clopping sounds of the Apache 's props grew louder . Stirred up , the balmy wind tugged at her eyelids and skin and , in short order , the aircraft hovered overhead . Morgan cupped her hand at her brow to shield her eyes , and glanced up . Jazie dropped a line from the chopper 's open door to the Sunrise 's deck and then took it down . <p> She landed lightly on the deck , motioned in a wide circle above her head for the Apache to give them some space , and then turned to Morgan . " I ca n't believe it . " Her tone turned incredulous , and her eyes stretched wide . " You missed him with your first shot ? " <p> " So it seems , " Morgan said through clenched teeth , definitely prickly . They 'd give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , she spoke into her lip mic , " Give us half a click , 248 . " She could n't yet release the chopper , but she did need to take precautionary measures to preserve any evidence onboard , should the target prove to belong to their adversary , Thomas Kunz . <p> Now that the target was down , she could breathe again , but it was no sin to admit that she 'd been scared stiff . Seasoned operatives had quaked at going toe-to-toe with Kunz . He held the undisputed votes of the Department of Defense , Homeland Security , and the S.A.S.S. as public enemy number one . Anyone with sense had a healthy fear of the ruthless killer . <p> The chopper pulled away , cut a wide arc , and waited . Its sounds weakened to a dull roar in the night . The wind direction had shifted . Tropical Storm Lil was definitely on the move . Morgan watched the lightning in the distance . In the last half hour , the outermost feeder band had moved substantially closer ; their timeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she missed , " Taylor Lee piped in , refusing to let it go . Shooting Morgan a smarmy look , she added a singsong lilt to her voice . " I 'm seeing lots of time at the firing range in your immediate future . " <p> Morgan took the heat without comment , which was n't easy , and let go of the opportunity to remind Taylor Lee that she was already the better shot . That 's why she 'd been in the water . " Just check the vessel . " <p> " Why ? " Taylor placed her palm flat on the back of the target 's head . " Jazie 's taking her in . She should do it . " <p> Tucking her long blond hair inside her shirt , Jazie tugged her collar up and her black stocking cap down on her ears , ignoring Taylor and telling Morgan , " If you do n't mind , I would rather do it myself . If I 'm taking her to port on my own , I want to know no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiery and outspoken , Taylor Lee slid Jazie a blistering glare that should have dropped her as cold as the target . " Are you saying you do n't trust me to search this vessel ? " <p> Oh , boy . Here it came . Morgan ground her teeth and prepared to pull rank to restore peace and get them back on point . Fortunately , Jazie read her mind and handled it on her own . <p> " Of course not . " Ever diplomatic , she effortlessly blew off Taylor 's heated question and toned down the tension with a smile . " I 'm saying I 'd rather bet my life on a check I 've run myself than on one anyone else has run . " <p> Getting the message but still taking exception , Taylor turned to Morgan . " Are you going to let her talk to me like that ? We 're a team here . What good is a team without trust ? You 're our fearless leader-and my damn maid of honor . Defend me , Morgan . " <p> Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " We have trust , but Jazie also has a point . It 's her neck on the line . " Morgan held off completely speaking her mind and shrugged , electing instead to shift the topic and get back to business . " You have been pretty preoccupied since this latest engagement to ... " Morgan blanked out . " What 's his name again ? " <p> " Rick , " Taylor said from between her teeth , clearly agitated . " I 'm marrying this one , okay ? So knock off pretending you ca n't remember who he is . " <p> " Sorry , " Morgan said and meant it . But her forgetting the new guy 's name was n't a pretense or as horrific-even for a maid of honor-as it might seem . Actually , it was ridiculously easy to understand , and even Taylor would see that if it were happening to anyone else 's fiancT . <p> In the three years they had been a team , Taylor Lee had been engaged at least half a dozen times . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on actual marriage , and so she 'd yet to make it to the altar . Now some would consider that odd , but when you have special skills , you also have special challenges . No one understood that like someone else with special skills and special challenges . So while the three of them had started out as professional associates , they also had become true friends . And in situations like Taylor 's frequent engagements , true friends bit their tongues and swallowed any skepticism or sarcasm they might ordinarily express . This was a matter of the heart , and one never does anything but fully support true friends on matters of the heart-even when doing so comes at inopportune times and minds should be on other matters , like now , with the target sprawled on the deck . Regarding Taylor 's fiancTs , Morgan and Jazie had been true friends . They 'd kept their mouths shut and had taken turns at being Taylor 's maid of honor . She switched men ; they switched positions . No problem . <p> So far , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of fiancTs pretty quickly , before the duties got too deep . <p> " Vessel 's secure , " Jazie said , emerging from the cabin . <p> " Great . " Morgan looked at Taylor Lee , whose hand was still on the target 's back . " You done yet ? " <p> " Yeah . " She pulled away and stood up , then backed up a few steps . <p> Jazie looked over , silently asking whether she should wait or go next . " Go ahead . " Morgan nodded at the target , delaying her own examination as long as possible . The unbridled rage in his eyes when he 'd lunged at her had been powerful , and she still felt the remnants of it sizzling on her skin . He 'd intended to kill her , and if he 'd reached her before she 'd shot him , he damn well might have . Knowing it still had her shaking inside . She needed to get grounded before scanning him to work past the fear . Otherwise , she would just be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she 'd picked up on Morgan 's struggle . " Go on , Jaz , " she repeated , eager to have it done without discussion . The sooner the mission was put to bed , the happier she 'd be . <p> Silently , Jazie bent down , let her hand hover just above his spine , and swept down his torso to his waist . She paused , and then reversed , brushing up his back to his head . Surprise flickered across her face , the corner of her mouth tilted up , and she glanced at Morgan . A knowing light burning in her eyes , she stood up and then backed away . <p> " What ? " Taylor Lee asked her . " Why the grin ? Did I miss something ? " <p> " Wait . " Biting her lower lip to downplay her mega-watt smile , Jazie gave Taylor Lee a negative nod and lifted her hand . " Go ahead , Morgan . " <p> Intuiting why Jazie was amused , Morgan pulled out her flashlight and stooped down beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millisecond-just long enough to see his neck . The telltale evidence presented itself : a droplet of blood . <p> " Damn it . " That from Taylor Lee . " You did n't miss him with your first shot . " <p> " No , I did n't . " Somewhat relieved , Morgan shoved her flashlight back into place at her hip and then scraped her fingertips over his angular face . <p> Stubble . Lean flesh and bone . Toned , relaxed muscle ... Nice . Far too nice ... She backed off , dusted her palms , then tried again , reminding herself he wanted her dead and when he awakened he would want to kill her all over again . That should have provided all the influence necessary , but it did n't , so she reminded herself who he could be : Thomas Kunz , the most feared terrorist on the planet-or one of his lethal body doubles . <p> That sobered her right up , put her mind solely back on business . Opening her mind , she cut her senses loose , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beneath and beyond the physical , and then deeper still until she tumbled fully into the nebulous realm of pure sensation ... <p> Anger . <p> Surprise . <p> Outrage . <p> She let the feelings flow through her and then slowed down and carefully examined the area just inside his hairline , under his jaw , looking for thin ridges of scars that would signal he 'd had plastic surgery . But she found none there , none at his ears or inside the tip of his nose , all of which confirmed her intuitive reaction to him . <p> " Unbelievable . " Obviously impressed , Taylor grunted from beside Jazie . " I ca n't freaking believe it . It honestly took two tranqs to knock him out ? " Admiration tinged her tone , admiration and a little interest that was purely female and purely sexual . " The guy must have the stamina of a bull . " <p> Morgan blanched . If the woman pulled one of her sex-kitten purrs , Morgan might just tranq her . <p> Jazie tilted her head . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . From around it , she studied his face . " I know you did n't expect a lightweight-not after seeing his photos . " <p> " I 'm engaged . " Taylor Lee snapped off a couple of photographs of him and the deck for the records , then clamped the camera back to a loop at her waist . " I was n't ... noticing assets , only relevant specifics . " <p> " Right . " Taylor Lee was full of it . She always noticed assets . But being honest-if only with herself-Morgan had noticed , too . And she had n't expected a lightweight . Still , a two-tranq knockout was a rare thing , especially with a neck shot . She glanced at Taylor Lee . " Noticing or not , it did take two to drop him . " Positioning her fingertips at his throat , she checked his pulse and stilled . Strong and surprisingly steady , considering the dosage he had absorbed . An odd tingle started in her fingertips , coursed through her hand and up her arm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distracted , she ran a quick second scan to double check , dragging only her index fingertips over his face and neck and then through his soft , thick hair . The sensations were powerful , strong , almost ... erotic . <p> Stunned , she drew in a sharp breath and rocked back on her haunches . " Damn it . " Erotic ? Where had that come from ? Who cared ? She blew past it , not wanting any part of it . She 'd never reacted personally to a patient in her practice or to a subject in her S.A.S.S. consults , and she was n't going to start now . <p> " Damn it , what ? " Jaz asked . <p> Morgan did n't dare answer . But with the risks , she had to confirm , and again tested her impressions . Blessing or curse , they did n't change . <p> " Two scans ? " Taylor asked , lifting both hands , palms up . " What the hell is going on here ? Is something wrong with you , Morgan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied , grabbing the first plausible excuse that came into her head . If she admitted that erotic stirrings from a target might have interfered with her input and she 'd had to scan twice to confirm her own findings , she would never know another moment 's peace . Taylor Lee and Jazie would see to it , and they well might report it to Colonel Drake , which would be a hundred times worse . As it was , it 'd haunt her . She did n't need insult added to injury from anyone else , and doubt was not a welcome thing in an S.A.T . team leader . <p> " We need to move , " she told them . " When he wakes up , we 're going to have two hundred pounds of Special Ops-trained , pissed-off man on our hands . I 'd prefer it if , when that happens , we have plenty of backup around to deal with him . " <p> " So is he , or is n't he ? " Jazie propped her hands on her hips . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the real Captain Jackson Stern . " Morgan nodded and looked from him up at Jazie . " If Thomas Kunz tried to substitute himself or someone else as a body double for Stern , he failed . " <p> " You 're sure ? " Taylor Lee narrowed her eyes . They glistened dark against the smooth rubber cupping her head . " No doubt ? " <p> " I 'm positive , " Morgan said , as certain of it as she had been that she 'd hit him with the first tranquilizer dart . She stood up . <p> " As positive as you can be without DNA backup , " Taylor Lee said . <p> Morgan nodded , giving her that one , and then swiveled her gaze to Jazie . " What did you get ? " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
