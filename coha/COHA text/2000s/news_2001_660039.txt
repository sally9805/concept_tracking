<p> I did n't really expect us to see a yowie - Australia 's own version of Bigfoot . But as the night dragged on , all ears straining to identify every sound in the night and rustle in the bushes , I did begin feeling a twinge of guilt : Somewhere out there among the eucalyptus and surrounding scrub , my wife was acting as bait . A few hours before , as the sun was setting and we were lathering up in bug repellent , it had seemed like a reasonable idea . We 'd arrived at the " hot zone " with our yowie hunting host , Dean Harrison , and somehow it had been decided that my wife and a visiting friend would lure the creature in . They would pretend to be camping in a dry riverbed where footprints had allegedly been spotted - and keep sausages sizzling on a portable gas barbecue to fill the air with an enticing aroma . There 's one basic rule for hunting yowies , Harrison told us : " You never go to the yowie ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to the allure , Harrison hung bloody beef shin bones in the trees around the campsite . The gist of Harrison 's instructions : If you hear anything big approaching the campsite , radio us and we 'll rush in and capture it on film . We 'd all been given portable radios , and it sounded like a reasonable plan . And , hey , there 's no such thing as a yowie anyway . Right ? I 'm as skeptical as the next guy . But after several hours of listening to Harrison 's yowie stories and the inevitable snaps and crackles you hear in moonlit woods , I began to doubt the wisdom of our plan . After all , Harrison had told us , yowies were lurking in Australia 's woods in unknown numbers and were responsible for the grisly deaths of hikers up and down Australia 's east coast . Only a few hundred yards from our campsite , he insisted , a yowie had attacked an RV and chased a group of dirt-bike riders . He was clearly edgy . " I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad guys up here , neither one of us is going to make it out , " Harrison , chief yowie hunter and spokesman for the Australian Homonid Research group , told me as dark began to fall and we hiked away from the campsite and into a nearby pine forest to stake out another spot where Harrison said he had spotted evidence of yowies before . Just as most Americans scoff at Bigfoot , most Australians laugh off yowies as a kooky myth or hoax . And zoologists are quick to point out that there 's no verifiable evidence of such a creature . But , real or phantom , the yowie says a lot about the nature of Australia and its capacity to both engender and embrace the weird . An island almost the size of the continental United States , Australia has a population of less than 20 million and large portions of the country remain not only unpopulated , but uncharted . That means that , 212 years after the arrival of British settlers , Australian scientists are still discovering significant pieces of the country 's already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , that , two hours ' drive from Sydney , a park ranger stumbled upon a stand of towering pines thought to be the arboreal equivalent of living dinosaurs . That natural backdrop leads to endless speculation about the possibility of survivors among species like the Tasmanian tiger , believed to be extinct . But it also leads to conjecture about things that go bump in the night - like yowies . " Science proves time and time again that they get things wrong . As soon as they declare a species extinct it turns up a few months later , " Harrison says . " They thought the Komodo dragon ( a giant lizard found in Indonesia ) was a myth made up by the natives until a white man saw one . " Harrison , a sales manager who claims he took up yowie hunting after being chased through the woods by an 8-foot- tall specimen one night in 1997 , says there is still little known about the creatures . What is known , he says , is that the yowie is related to the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia via a land bridge from Asia thousands of years ago . Like its cousins elsewhere , Harrison claims , the yowie resembles a cross between a human and an ape . Covered in thick black or gray fur , it walks on two feet and has arms that dangle to its knees . " The distinct difference between the Bigfoot and the yowie is that we 've got two species here , " Harrison says . The first , he claims , is a smaller , less aggressive version known as the jingera in Aboriginal lore , while the second can grow to 8 feet or more and is far more ferocious than its cousins elsewhere . Harrison says he has made casts of footprints and heard what he believes to be yowies crashing through the woods . He claims that he has come close enough to a yowie to know that they are odoriferous . And he says he has identified one yowie with an ear for Neil Diamond . But , for all his chronicles of tracking the mysterious yowie , Harrison has yet to capture one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for all that yowies are more than a myth . Most Australians think yowies are simply characters from tall tales , good for a few laughs . " I 'm happy to say there probably is n't a yowie , " says Bob Nixon , chief investigator for the Australian Skeptics , a group dedicated to debunking tales of the paranormal . " The yowie is something that speaks to our sense of humor , " Mr. Nixon says . " Everybody else has got one , so we might as well have one . " The myth is so ingrained in Australian culture that confectioner Cadbury markets chocolate yowies filled with toys that have caused a collectors ' boom rivaling Pokemon in Australia . Go to www.yowie.com and you 'll find plastic collectibles , not Web-surfing yowies . " Compared with a chocolate product that hopefully everyone in Australia can find in a store near them , the yowie ( the flesh- and-bones version ) has been pretty elusive , " says Tim Stanford , the marketing director for Cadbury Australia . Mr. Stanford says the name yowie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in popularity with Australians . He believes part of the draw is that , as a relatively young nation , Australia has few of the age-old myths older countries do . Some might dispute that , however , given that the myth-rich Aboriginal culture is thought to be among the oldest surviving on earth . But Stanford argues that for most Australians , " there is a huge attraction to what myths Australia has and , perhaps because of the lack of them , those that it does have it 's incredibly proud of . " Like anything with an " X Files " quality to it , the hunt for the yowie has generated its share of conspiracy theories . Harrison claims to be in regular contact with sources in the police and military that he says confirm he 's not chasing shadows - and that an active government coverup is under way . " Off the record they talk to us and say ' yes , it is what you think it is . ' On the record they say : ' We 've been informed by higher authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysteria . ' " Yowie hunting also comes with its own politics and rivalries . One of Harrison 's chief rivals is a self-styled , publicity-hungry " cryptozoologist " who has legally changed his name to " Tim the Yowie Man " and drew media mentions last year when he claimed to have wandered onto the set of Survivor II and published on the Internet directions to the set 's secret location . Yet , during our night in the woods , the yowie 's whereabouts remained as elusive as ever . It was quiet for most of the night , although both Harrison and another yowie hunter occasionally claimed to hear telltale noises . But around 4 a.m. , an alarmed call came in over the radio from my wife , Rachel . " Are any of you walking near the cars ? " she asked . " No , " the answer went back . " We both heard footsteps between us and the cars , " Rachel went on . A few minutes later , my friend Brian was on the air : " We think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . " Harrison whispered into his radio : " Is it definitely bipedal ? " It took a minute and then Brian was back : " It 's hard to tell . But it 's definitely not small . It 's definitely not a rat . It 's definitely bigger than that . " " OK , hold your positions , " Harrison answered . Soon afterward the hunt was called off - Brian 's description had been too vague for Harrison to get excited and rush in , camera rolling . The next morning Harrison searched the area around the campsite and found nothing . But both Rachel and Brian were spooked , and when we got back to camp they were peering out of the tent waiting eagerly for our return . Spend long enough in the woods and you 'll hear something go " boo . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
