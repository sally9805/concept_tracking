Dating to 1896 , when Pittsburgh philanthropist Andrew Carnegie established a series of modern art shows at the Renaissance-style museum he built , the Carnegie International has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . Installed in the elaborate , three-story Carnegie Museum of Art , the exhibition has gone through many incarnations over the years . It was a juried annual , a biennial and a triennial . It became a curated show , then briefly a twoartist show . For the past quarter century it has occurred every four years or so , with an in-house curator , buttressed by outside advisers , making the selections and formulating the themes . Winners of the exhibition 's grand prize have included Henri Matisse , Pablo Picasso , Georges Braque , Anselm Kiefer , Richard Serra , Rebecca Horn , On Kawara , Richard Artschwager and Sigmar Polke , which is quite a roster , and hundreds of other significant figures have shown there through the years . Bringing cutting-edge art to Pittsburgh is what this show is all about , and in turn Pittsburgh , which is otherwise not known as such , temporarily becomes a major art destination . Laura Hoptman , a curator of contemporary art at the Carnegie Museum and formerly assistant curator in the department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized the 54th Carnegie International . Hoptman made a name for herself with several intelligent , forwardlooking exhibitions at MOMA . Among these were a 1997 project room exhibition of figurative paintings by John Currin , Elizabeth Peyton and Luc Tuymans ; a 1998 Yayoi Kusama show ( co-curated with Lynn Zelevansky ) ; and the highly acclaimed 2002-03 " Drawing Now : Eight Propositions , " which somewhat unexpectedly riveted a large audience for months .

Hoptman effectively countered a prevailing curatorial tendency to cram in work after work , artist after artist , which makes everything a blur for the viewer and undermines the idiosyncrasies of individual participants ( while , incidentally , deflecting attention toward the curator who has put the whole thing together , which is probably precisely the point ) . There is art on display in just about all mediums , including abstract and representational painting , large and small sculpture , performance and installation . A hefty ( but not withering ) selection of film and video is also included , shown both in museum galleries and an adjacent cinema . Moreover , many of the works were made specifically for this exhibition , guaranteeing that this famous survey of contemporary art is indeed contemporary . Obviously , such an exhibition has many counterparts elsewhere within the ever-proliferating system of large-scale international exhibitions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical extension of the role , scope and power of curators . No longer charged with finding the " best , " whatever that is , curators are free to explore all kinds of material , ranging from visual art per se to cultural and political theory , philosophy , sociology , ethics , economics and probably many other disciplines as well , all framed as urgent and pressing . At the Carnegie International , Hoptman continues this tendency to advance big , overarching themes , not only about art but about life and the world . Here are her ideas in a nutshell . For centuries , artists have trafficked in core issues concerning life and death , faith and doubt , immortality , ethics , free will , God and spirituality , along with questions ( " Who am I ? " , " Who are we ? " and " Where are we going ? " ) that philosophers after Kant , according to Hoptman , have called " the Ultimates . " In Hoptman 's terms , a major failure of both cultural theory and artistic production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these " intimates , " with a preference instead for politics , everyday situations and materials , irony , identity issues and what have you . Her solution is to focus on profound matters again , choosing art that concerns itself with the problems and aspirations of human beings in these supremely conflicted times . " Ultimates " or not , a goodly number of the wellknown younger or midcareer artists featured here have been on the biennial circuit for years , for instance Ugo Rondinone , Carsten Holler , Maurizio Cattelan , John Bock , Pawel Althamer , Julie Mehretu , Francis Alys and Neo Rauch . Among other participants , Yang Fudong was recently nominated for the Hugo Boss Prize and Kutlug Ataman for the Turner Prize-which Jeremy Deller just won-although in all likelihood Hoptman selected these artists before they received these accolades . While she thankfully brought in other artists who are not biennial veterans , there was a lot of itinerant star power here . Further tying the exhibition into the international circuit was the presence , on the advisory board , of consummate insider Francesco Bonami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.A , May ' ' 03 , with its laughable subtitle " The Dictatorship of the Viewer " ( laughable because that vast show , especially the Aperto section , with its several sub-curators and multiple , predictably burning themes , actually had far more to do with the dictatorship of the curator than the viewer ) . Also on the advisory board was artist Rirkrit Tiravanija , the 2004 winner of the Hugo Boss Prize and one of three curators of the " Utopia Station " section of Bonami 's Biennale .

No.1 , 1977/2004 , nylon mesh and sand . // When you factor in that the majority of other participating artists are already ensconced in the art , world , oftentimes represented by hot galleries like Anton Kern and Gavin Brown in New York , the Modern Institute in Glasgow , Sadie Coles in London , and Blum and Poe in Los Angeles , it becomes clear that this show is not about making startling new discoveries , but instead about thematically recontextualizing artists who are already visible , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than its fair share of rewarding moments . Turkish artist Ataman 's video installation Kba ( 2004 ) won the juried top prize , and rightly so . Each of 40 cheap television monitors atop rickety tables shows a resident of the notorious Istanbul ghetto of Kiiba talking directly into the camera . Together , the personal stories they recount amount to a portrait of a community that is beleaguered by social , economic and political forces but is also richly humane and tolerant of its diverse members ( see my article on Ataman inA.i.A , Feb. ' ' 05 ) . In an interesting curatorial decision , Ataman 's installation is the first work on the top floor at the Carnegie . Rather than ushering you into the exhibition , it stops you in your tracks , that is , if you are willing to sit down and give yourself over to it . Elsewhere , Swedish artist Mamma Andersson 's oil paintings , a combination of straightforward realism , cartoons , science fiction and dreamscapes , feature routine domestic settings and landscapes that have morphed into weird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sweeping vista encompassing white mountains , a yellow , beige , blue and black body of water , a scraggly pine forest and roiling white clouds streaked with green makes you think that the landscape surrounding someone 's cherished summer or childhood home in a bucolic Swedish setting had suddenly been transplanted to a new , fantastical , supercharged planet . // Tomma Abts : Ert , 2003 , acrylic and oil on canvas , 18 7/8 by 15 inches . Boros Collection , Berlin . // American Senga Nengudi 's floor painting is surprising , once you find it , in an old vestibule at the bottom of a grand staircase . Swirling light blue and russet pigments in different patterns sluice across a bed of sand . The work suggests vast landscapes and rivers seen from on high , and alludes to African and Native American sand paintings , while functioning as an effective abstraction in its own right . In another space , Nengudi presents a selection of her mid1970s sculptures , including some pouches made from nylon mesh ( as in women 's stockings ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the ceiling and jutting into the space , or angling downward so that the pendulous sacks just barely nestle on the floor , these works exist somewhere between postminimalist abstraction , feminist-inflected art ( in their novel use of the stockings ) and African art . They also anticipate by years work by later artists , for example the Brazilian Ernesto Neto , who has become famous for his own drooping pouches . The exhibition 's nuttiest , and funniest , work is a video by German John Bock in which a man and a woman engage in all sorts of desperate , seemingly pointless scientific experiments using jerry-built apparatuses ( Meechfever , 2004 ) . Gelatinous masks , comic vehicles , bubbling liquids in tubes , body fluids and cows in a pasture all figure prominently in this madcap adventure , which turns a couple 's routine day at home and outdoors into some sort of demented quest . ( A number of the settlings were re-created as installations in the Carnegie 's galleries . ) An excellent choice on Hoptman 's part was to include a generous selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniature sculptures . They suggest the sort of cheesy decorative figurines you might find on the shelves in your oldest auntie 's house-except that here they have become eerie , freakish mutants ( though visually lush and oddly lovely ) . Butterly 's Mask ( 2003 ) is a yellow , somewhat ear-shaped form that rests upright on a circular blue base . A small purple " nose " protrudes outward from the yellow shape , yielding a vaguely clownish look ; the whole work is ungainly , exuberant and curiously sad at the same time . Corresponding nicely to Butterly 's diminutive works are German Isa Genzken 's small , willfully messy sculptural vignettes , placed atop pedestals . For some years now , Genzken has been making quixotic models of urban skyscrapers and other buildings , including a series based on New York City , out of found , everyday objects . Then came September 11 , and Genzken 's eccentric , always fragile and distressed works suddenly seemed eerily prescient . The sculptures here , from a series called " Empire/Vampire , Who Kills Death , " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feature a dense array of found objects , including toy soldiers , kitchen tools , drinking glasses , wood , foil and plastic implements , along with occasional photographs . They conjure urban architecture buffeted by conflict , disruption , fear and yearning . Nearby are Ethiopian-born , New York-based Julie Mehretu 's large " Stadia " paintings-vast panoramic fields filled with a welter of dots , tiny lines , directional indications , shreds of slogans and advertisements , banners and flags . Little lines resemble tiny spectators , and while Mehretu 's paintings suggest arenas ( for instance , those of ancient Rome ) as battlegrounds for all sorts of competing ideologies and information systems , they are a real pleasure to look at , with their mix of sweeping gestures and intricate micro-touches. // Robert Crumb : Unfitted drawing from a sketchbook dated October 1990-October 1991 , ink and mixed mediums on paper , 9 by 7 inches , c R.

Collection Elizabeth Levine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breaking News ( Dedicated to Peter Watkins ) , 2004 , three period dioramas , each approx. 12 by 24 inches , each with a miniature video monitor . // Although the exhibition is not stridently political , a sharp recognition of how the world has changed in the past few years courses through several works . American Paul Chan 's digital animation Happiness ( finally ) after 35,000 Years of Civilization-after Henry Darger and Charles Fourier ( 2000-03 ) , inspired in part by the writings of the 19th-century socialist Utopian Fourier and by the noted outsider artist Darger 's " Vivian Girl " characters , evokes cartoons and computer games , and also has a sci-fi , otherworldly quality . An Edenic forest is home to the contemplative idylls and sensual frolics of young girls who seem like sprites or waifs . Gradually the scene evolves into trailer homes , where a banquet is held , and then everything is invaded by businessmen talking into cell phones , priests , judges and shooting soldiers who turn a once lovely setting into one of terror and militarism run amok . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-part video installation Eye/ Machine ( 2001-03 ) makes use of copious found footage to detail the development of ultra-technological weapons , many having their own sight systems . As one watches crosshairs lining up targets , smart bombs zeroing in , satellite imagery of the earth down below that will apparently likewise be blown up , and other harrowing marvels , it becomes clear that these deadly weapons amount , among other things , to a chilling and utterly impersonal new method of seeing . A subtle and enigmatic , yet deeply ominous , wall-projected video ( 2002 ) by American Trisha Donnelly ( one of four works by the artist dispersed through the exhibition ) features the phrase " Night Is Coming , " which fades in and out of view and perfectly crystallizes what many people are feeling now , namely anxiety and dread mixed with wavering hopefulness . Equally ambiguous are the small figurative paintings and drawings by Francis Alys , an expatriate Belgian who has long been a central figure in Mexico City 's thriving arts scene . Alys is best known for his acclaimed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mix elements of process art , sightseeing , sociological research and social critique ) , as well as for videos of temporary outdoor projects and other public works . But painting and drawing are also a constant part of his practice . Here , a room-filling installation including works on the walls and in vitrines chronicles an ongoing investigation ( the earliest painting dates to 1992 ) of contemporary spirituality in relation to mortality , violence and political conflict . Several of Alys 's somber yet enchanting paintings are like devotional works : a levitating , barechested boy who lays his hand on another boy 's head , like a blessing ; a young girl who clasps a skeleton . Other pieces depict odd moments of repose , for instance two identical boys asleep on a field of camouflage . With particular effectiveness , Alys singled out one small work-a thoughtful man in a gray suit seen with his hands behind his back-and installed it alone in a nearby , otherwise empty room , making solitude seem richly meditative , but also painfully lonely . Incidentally , the exhibition 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maurizio Cattelan , who contributed a lifesize , barefoot sculpture of President John F. Kennedy lying in state ( Now , 2004 ) . The sculpture was originally intended by Cattelan to be installed in a large public hall occasionally used for museum festivities . For the opening , the work was temporarily placed in a room adjacent to the museum president 's office , after which it was slated to be returned to its intended location . Apparently , Cattelan changed his mind , insisting that it remain in the second location , which is normally not open to the public at all , and therefore it was removed from the exhibition altogether for quite some time . Eventually a compromise solution was reached , allowing it to be installed as Cattelan now wished , but only for very limited viewing hours . The sculpture was n't on view when I visited , but I have the feeling that a lot more will be heard of Cattelan 's dead Kennedy , with its goodbye to an American hero who became a beloved international icon , to liberalism and to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luster is the presence of a number of works that might fit with Hoptman 's theme but that just do n't command attention , even-or perhaps especially-when contributed by well-known figures . Brussels-born , Sweden-based Carsten Holler created a greenhouse filled with plants allegedly emitting pheromones that allegedly fill you with desire and prepare you to fall in love ( Solandra Greenhouse , 2004-05 ) . It is more interesting as an idea-chemically induced states of desire , as opposed to desire that just arises-than as a sculpture . Tough to square with Hoptman 's theme are American Philip-Lorca diCorcia 's large photographs of female strippers pole-dancing ( 200304 ) . The images-taken in empty clubs where the dancers performed alone for the artist-are striking , that is if you like seeing illuminated , upside down , bare-breasted , thong-wearing women doing their thing , but they seem to be in the wrong show . Suddenly " The intimates " seems like the name of some gentlemen 's club on the outskirts of town . Pawel Althamer , from Poland , uses professional actors to intermittently stage , on the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile a video projection serving as a Hollywoodesque trailer for the nonmovie outside continuously plays overhead inside the museum . At a time when seemingly every other television show turns routine , real-life situations into entertainment , Althamer 's Real Time Movie is yet another variation on a prevalent theme . British artist Jeremy Deller s shopping bags and T-shirts imprinted with bible passages , which are sold in the museum 's store , want to be provocative , with their conflation of consumerism and spirituality , but instead they merit a " who cares " shrug . Far better , though hardly earth-shattering , is Deller 's Breaking News ( Dedicated to Peter Watkins ) , an installation-really more like an interventioncommissioned for the exhibition . Deller placed tiny video monitors playing reenacted battles within three miniature historical dioramas , part of the museum 's permanent collection . In an exquisitely made 18th-century French room , for instance , the monitor displays fake scenes from the French and Indian War . While these works have a spectacular , how'd-he-do-it quality , their operative ideas-mixing past and present , historical verities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than profound .

The Japanese artist Chiho Aoshima used an exacting process to transform a large wall in a main corridor into a digital-era mural that includes a giant churning wave , a young girl 's open-mouthed face that seems at once aghast and vaguely erotic , toppling skyscrapers , fiery colors and smoke . Aoshima designed the images on a computer and had the high-resolution data made into what is in effect a gigantic photograph , which was then cut into lengths and applied like wallpaper . It is a mix of pop and youth culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here the combination looks decorative and fashionable , like the dcor in a cool Tokyo club . // View of Maurizio Cattelan 's Now . 2004 , wax , human hair , polyester resin and clothes , life-size. // Irish artist Eva Rothschild 's freestanding , abstract sculptures made out of lacquered wood , vinyl or , in one work , incense sticks protruding from the wall ; Los Angeles painter Mark Grotjahn 's near-monochromatic abstractions featuring rudimentary , radiating geometric forms and two vanishing points ; and Glasgow sculptor Jim Lambie 's installation that incorporates chair backs , pocketbooks , a mattress and bright paint all have their moments . While revisiting and updating a vaulting Modernist abstract vocabulary , however , they all operate in rather safe niches . More convincing , and more immediately idiosyncratic , are British photographer Saul Fletcher 's small self-portraits featuring unusual costumes and quirky poses , and German Tomma Abts 's small acrylic-and-oil abstract paintings in muted colors , featuring skewed lines , triangles and parallelograms . At once fractious and oddly meditative , Abts 's meticulously composed works have Constructivist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Saul Fletcher : Untitled #136 , 2000 , chromogenic print , 3 by 2 , inches . // Neo Ranch : Zoll , 2004 , oil on canvas , approx. 7 by 13 feet . // On the other hand , one of Hoptman 's more unorthodox moves was to include three miniretrospectives of older artists , and her choices add a great deal to the show . One features works by the American Robert Crumb , many of which are based on the turbulent East Village subculture of the late 1960s and ' ' 70s . Crumb 's sexually explicit , politically charged and morally ambiguous drawings with text , far from remaining underground comics , now seem like national treasures , and chronicle an America riven by faith and lust , Utopian yearnings and debilitating social conflicts . A recent traveling retrospective of American sculptor Lee Bontecou belatedly returned her to the spotlight after a long absence see A.i.A. , June/July ' ' 04 . The Carnegie includes two of Bontecou 's looming wall constructions made from welded steel , iron , wood and canvas ; a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from a dizzying array of tiny parts-works that are mostly abstract but evoke intricate insects , sciencefiction space stations and mythic creatures in flight . Bontecou as a source of inspiration for many younger artists is here vividly demonstrated by those navigating their way between nature , science , machines , abstraction and poetic vision . The Croatian artist Mangelos is news to me , and I 'm also willing to bet he 's news to many others , as well . Mangelos , it turns out , was the pseudonym of art historian , theoretician and curator Dimitrije Basicevic ( 1921-1987 ) . As Mangelos , he inscribed credos in multiple languages on painted globes , published various manifestoes and , in his paintings and sculptures , frequently used scientific and mathematical symbols as well as snippets of letters and words . A sampling of all such works is presented here . Mangelos 's theory was that the artistic future , in these technologically advanced times , belongs to " functional thinking " ( analytic approaches , a willingness to incorporate language and other systems of knowledge ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphorical " approaches ( namely woozy , not-tobe-trusted feeling ) . Clear-headed and analytical or not , Mangelos manages to be Utopian , bewildering and ironic at the same time . Especially remarkable is that he generated his future-oriented , highconcept work in Tito 's Yugoslavia , which was not exactly known as a hotbed of technological innovation and artistic freedom . Yang Fudong , from China , presents the first two parts of what will eventually be the five-part , two-hour film Seven Intellectuals in Bamboo Forest , based on a folkloric Chinese story of seven intellectuals living in the third and fourth centuries who , seeking maximum freedom and transcendence of earthly limitations , go on a voyage of discovery into nature . In Part 1 , seven hip , young , savvy and artistic representatives of the new China leave their normal haunts for their own nature voyage , where they become pensive , contemplative , awed and a bit out of place , while in Part 2 the same characters return to the city . The black-and-white film is filled with captivating images , suggesting both inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most gorgeous works in a show that in general is more about ideas than visual dynamism . Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone 's six-screen video Roundelay ( 2003 ) , set to a score by composer Philip Glass and installed in a specially designed hexagonal room , involves a different kind of voyaging . You see a thoughtful young woman and man , always separate from each other and always alone , as they endlessly walk through Paris streets and architectural settings at night . Rondinone 's sleek esthetic , replete with the cascading score , conjures music videos , fashion advertisements , television commercials and generic urban hipsterdom , yet what saves the work is its mood of raw , nagging loneliness . These figures walk with a purpose , but they get nowhere in particular , and while you sense they might be looking for one another , they never meet . Another-decidedly eccentricvideo in which music is central is by Katarzyna Kozyra , from Poland ( The Rite of Spring , 1999/2004 ) . As Igor Stravinsky 's Rite of Spring plays , one sees video projections on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shift about in herky-jerky movements inspired by Vaslav Nijinsky 's notorious 1913 choreography for Stravinsky 's ballet . The twist here , however , is that no one actually dances . Kozyra took photographs of old people lying on white backdrops , and then used these still photographs to make her animated video . Ultimately , there is something comical but also deeply disturbing about these exposed elderly people who resemble marionettes on strings .

Photograph View of Rachel Harrinon 's photographs , 2001 , and sculpture , 2004. // When the exhibition most clicks , pronounced visuality and potent ideas seamlessly blend , for instance in recent paintings by the German Neo Rauch . Over the past several years , critical and commercial energies have advanced Rauch as perhaps the next great German painter , in an era already marked by great German painters . The six works here suggest that Rauch is indeed worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicted humanity evinced by his figures , who manage to seem robust , befuddled , intent , fashionable and thoroughly ridiculous at the same time . In Zoll ( Customs ) , 2004 , two elegant women have reached a customs house teetering on a mountain pinnacle in the middle of nowhere . A coursing stream , nearby forests and turbulent clouds recall Romantic raptures , but this scene is otherwise all strange , bureaucratic business . Two officials open the women 's suitcases to disclose an inexplicable pile of bones and a gravity-defying column of rocks . No one is fazed . Weird miracles are going on here , permeated by an excruciating banality . Rauch , who accesses elements of 19thcentury Romanticism , 20th-century Social Realism , Surrealism and the illustrations in bygone East German textbooks ( he 's from the former East Germany and still lives in Leipzig ) , is a trailblazing figurative painter , and he 's obviously not resting on his laurels in these dynamic new works . American Anne Chu provides another version of psychologically complex figures , with her fanciful , upright sculptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . In a series called " Nine Hellish Spirits " ( 2004 ) , sculptures made from smoke-fired ceramics , wire and mixed mediums resemble ancient deities ( of the demonic sort ) but also have hints of contemporary cartoons . Their postures and expressions have a peculiar ability to evoke complex states of being , for instance leering malevolence mixed with loneliness and bewilderment . American Rachel Harrison 's three sculptures look , as usual , tremendous . They 're wacky yet astute confections involving wood , polystyrene , cement , cardboard , a tucked-in video monitor , and judiciously placed popcorn and pop culture magazines . I was most captivated , however , by finding ( again ) Harrison 's 2001 photographs of a house in New Jersey where the Virgin Mary was allegedly once seen as an apparition in a window , " Untitled ( Perth Amboy ) . " In the photographs you see a hand touching the windowpane , smudges , someone clutching a rosary , just the hint of a woman 's face as she experiences some suburban rapture , and other enigmatic shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was precisely what Hoptman was after : intelligent and savvy contemporary art that is nonetheless open to spiritual mysteries and the depths of the human soul .
