BETWEEN THE MADOFF SCANDAL and the AIG debacle , there 's been a good deal of rich bashing lately , much of it richly deserved . But let 's be fair : not all people of means are mean  --  or greedy , self-seeking or patently dishonest . In fact , most wealthy Americans are solid citizens who have made their money the old-fashioned way , by working hard over a long period of time . They are also pretty generous about giving it away . I do n't mean all of it  --  remember , this is still a capitalist society , no matter what some may think to the contrary  --  but enough to help in many areas desperately requiring assistance . I would love to report that after five years of producing an annual issue devoted to philanthropy , it 's no longer necessary to cover the plights and the people we feel are in need of your attention . Unfortunately , quite the opposite is true . Government funding is dwindling , and the portfolios of private individuals have seriously diminished , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selective about where their money goes ( see our " Social Graces " essay about this very subject , on page 88 ) . Where philanthropy is concerned , it is not just the thought that counts , it 's the deed . Within this issue you will meet a group of people who are avid doers and whose deeds have had tremendous effects , all of them positive . Fifty years ago , where there was once a New York City slum ( it was the inspiration for the groundbreaking musical West Side Story ) , ground was literally broken to make way for an ambitious arts complex called Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts . Over a half century it has met with rants and raves  --  about the physical plant , about the acoustics , about who was in charge ( and who was n't ) and about specific performances , the artists who appeared in them , even the costumes and the set designs . Lincoln Center survived it all . Now it is at a crossroads : ready for a major renovation , with the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely favorable reviews . A great deal of money , both public and private , is being invested in its future . The saga of Lincoln Center is the stuff of high drama , vividly recounted in this issue by Amanda Vaill ( page 90 ) , a writer who has been there so often as a spectator that she feels it was part of her upbringing . In our three-part section " Women for Women , " which begins on page 102 , we take a look at what a trio of accomplished and determined females are doing for others of their gender in unimaginably difficult circumstances , not only in developing countries but right here on our own soil . They saw light where there was darkness , and now they are leading the way . Consider being a fundraiser who finds herself the victim of a natural disaster that calls for massive relief efforts . This is the story of Sandy Sheehy , whose residence in Galveston , Texas , was destroyed last September by the floods that resulted from Hurricane Ike ( page 108 ) . Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side . Let hers be a lesson for all of us . Recently , I visited a pair of shelters in a borderline section of Brooklyn . They are run by Women in Need ( WIN ; women-in-need.org ) , an organization that provides housing and other support for families  --  mostly women and their children  --  who would otherwise be homeless . As part of my tour , I went to two rooms where under-school-aged children were being cared for while their mothers were out trying to find work or the next place to live or fulfilling their obligations related to addictions or arrests . Except for a few involuntary outbursts from a couple of hungry mouths or from those who sensed that there were strangers in their midst , the youngsters were calm , sweet and cheerful . The resilience of children never ceases to astonish me . Our deputy editor , John Cantrell , felt much the same way when he traveled to northwestern Cambodia to visit the Ankgor Hospital for Children , in Siem Reap ( page 110 ) . John did n't quite know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research a story for Town &; Country . Or so he thought . But why do n't I let him tell you : " You know that all over the globe , there is a world of need ; you know that in a world of plenty , millions lack food , shelter , water , health care . You write your checks to the groups trying to help ; you go to fundraisers ; you donate and do what you can . But if you are standing there in Cambodia , if you are on the bank of a lake , watching people trying to catch fish with threadbare nets and sometimes just their bare hands in water so foul and dirty it would make mud or oil look clean , then you are able to see firsthand how dire the need and how vital the services provided . And then you know for sure : the charity we do is right . And no matter what , you will live with the certainty of that knowledge and be at least a little better for having felt it .
