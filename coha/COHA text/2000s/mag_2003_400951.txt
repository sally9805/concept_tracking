// " In our family we were not to speak against the weather , " the author Patricia Hampl writes in her memoir A Romantic Education of her Minnesota upbringing . " Our cold was our pride . " That spirit was apparent last May ii among those who participated in the loth annual sale sponsored by the Minnesota Potters of the Upper St. Croix River Valley . Snowflakes had appeared a few days before , and there had been six inches of snow a few weeks earlier , in late April . But the gray , chin , wet Saturday morning that marked the start of the two-day sale apparently did not dampen the spirits of the ceramics enthusiasts who visited the seven stops on the tour . At least 20 vehicles lined the driveway when I arrived as light rain fell around lo in the morning at Robert Briscoe 's , an hour north of the Twin Cities . There were almost as many when I arrived in midafternoon , with rain turning to sleet , at Richard Abnet 's , after wending my way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen at earlier stops and encountered again at Abnet 's were having a merry time , their pleasure in the hunt undiminished by rain , sleet , ( possible ) snow or impending dark of night . The exact origin of the idea for the group sale has been lost in the murky clays of time , but is generally credited to Briscoe and Will Swanson , who along with Abnet , Jeff Oestreich , Linda Christianson , Richard Vincent and Warren MacKenzie , joined forces in 1993 . MacKenzie participated only forthe first three years ; Connie Mayeron came on board in 1994 . " We agreed , " Swanson says , " not to make a lot of rules . " They 've succeeded on that score , keeping to two basic principles by limiting the sale to ceramics and not adding to the number of potteries on the tour . Since 1997 , however , all of the potters except Abnet have hosted other potters . Some of the guests last year were familiar figures in Minnesota ceramics , including Amy Sabrina , who lives on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Twin Cities resident before she moved to Nebraska . Both were hosted by Mayeron , who loves to spend a " girfriends " weekend " with these old friends and takes a certain delight in the fact that all three produce work far removed from the " brown pots " that often define Minnesota functional pottery . Other guests came from the East ( Mary Barringer of Massachusetts , Neil Patterson and Sandi Pierantozzi of Pennsylvania , Haynes Bayless of Connecticut ) , and the Far East , that is , Australia ( Greg Crow , Sandy Lockwood and Neil Hoffman , who worked at Oestreich 's for the month leading up to the sale ) . The guest program increases the diversity of the offerings , although Malcolm Davis from Washington , DC , also at Oestreich 's , no doubt felt right at home presenting his shino ware in the heart of Mingei-sota . Over the years , collectors , friends and acquaintances have flown and driven in from places far and near . The Aussies aside , perhaps the most remarkable visitors in 2002 were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vancouver with Christianson and decided to drive the 14 hours to her sale . They arrived in the middle of a downpour , bringing a cooler with about 25 pounds of fresh-picked asparagus as a gift , and delayed accepting the offer of a hot shower in order to get right down to picking out some pots . The event is a kind of rural gallery crawl , with country roads replacing urban sidewalks . In 2002 , Mother 's Day weekend offered an appropriate time for buying . The emphasis is on functional ware at relatively modest prices , not gallery-style showpieces for high-end collectors , although there are more expensive ceramics and sculptural work , including the collaborations between Mayeron and her husband , the sculptor Fuller Cowles , and the extraordinary netsuke of Janel Jacobson , Swanson 's wife ( apparently there is a spousal exemption to the ceramics-only rule ) . Sabrina brought moderately priced works but also a magnificent , museum-quality vase that gave a local couple a case of Lake Wobegon sticker shock with its price of almost $10,000 . The pottery tour is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipts last year went well beyond $150,000 . Yet the weekend blends marketing and hospitality , providing an opportunity to see the studios , meet the potters and relax a bit before heading off to the next site . Briscoe says , " It 's not about being in a hurry . It 's not a race . " At Jacobson and Swanson 's , Jacobson was pulling fresh bread from the oven when I arrived , to add to the cookies already set out . Briscoe likes to have a bonfire and some music at the end of the first day , along with food and drink , for those who may return after making Photograph // the rounds . As a group event , the sale garners publicity and mobilizes those who might resist a trip to a single potter . It is also helpful as a means of what Briscoe calls " cross-fertilizing of customers . " Only a few weeks before , the Northern Clay Center in Minneapolis , where several of the potters have work in the retail shop , sponsored the American Pottery Festival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Matthew Metz , a Briscoe guest , who lives in Minnesota during the summer ) , accompanied by a series of demonstrations . In 2002 the Festival also had its best year ever , a tribute to the great love of ceramics in the Twin Cities area . There have been some difficult moments , as when the power and water went out at the Jacobson-Swanson home for the entire weekend , or the time Christianson looked up to see a dozen maple trees on the edge of the yard toppled bya straight-line wind . Fortunately , her guest that year , Tim Crane , had not yet set out his pots . A few years ago an attack of killer Minnesota mosquitoes was bad enough to be remarked upon even by diehard natives who asa rule pretend not to be bothered . But in the good years the April showers ( or snows ) bring not mosquitoes but May wildflowers , and morel mushrooms as well . When I drove up the interstate to the Briscoes there were boats out on the lakes : it was the fishing season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pottery tour ca n't match those numbers , but its success is testimony to the strength of the ceramics community and the quality of the work . When Mayeron joined in the second year , only 30 to 50 people came to her door . This year 14,000 fliers were printed , and a good guess is that about 2,500 people hit the trail during the two days . There is a sense in the group that the event has grown close to its limits , in terms of crowds and parking , and the problem of making enough pots so that there are good choices available for the second-day shoppers . Briscoe has widened his driveway in anticipation of the 2003 event , and Christianson is designing new signs to help people negotiate the back roads and find the potteries : one year she received a cell phone call from someone who had wound up on the far side of the St. Croix in Wisconsin and , apparently having watched too many bad airplane movies , said , " Talk me in.

For Oestreich the sale is " a catalyst for change , " energizing him and pushing him to do a new body of work and devote a long stretch of time to develop his ideas ; this year he is dedicating about four months to sale preparation . He has come to look forward to the time hosting and working with guest artists , because " winter out here gets pretty long . " The potters may live in the country , following the lead of MacKenzie and , of course , Leach and Hamada . But there is nothing provincial about them or their work . The country potter model remains appealing , and the St. Croix event , like the many pottery tours held elsewhere in the United States , is a good survival strategy . All the potters moved to the country before 19o , and now find suburbia marching ever closer . Five years ago , Oestreich was able to purchase 4o acres as a buffer to go with the five he bought 29 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avnet , who bought his place near Stillwater more than 40 years ago , wonders where young potters will find affordable land for a rural home and studio , given the sprawl surrounding the Twin Cities and the vacation and retirement home boom . All the same , the area covered by the tour retains some of its pastoral charm . I saw flights of geese on the drive up , and a pheasant scooted across the road as I was going from one stop to the next . Ad inner gathering at the Mayeron-Cowles residence after the second day of the 2002 sale provided a good illustration of what Kendall has called " that ultimate human experience : a good meal among friends . " It was easy to see not only exhaustion , satisfaction and relief , but an overall sense of camaraderie in the group , nicely described by Mayeron as " a hands-on community ... a heartfelt community . " At a meeting of the seven core members several years ago , a suggestion was made that a percentage of the sales be donated to a charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years guest potters have contributed as well . The money goes to a ceramics purchase fund at the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota . Such a gift says a great deal about the individuals involved in the tour and the generosity and commitment that help define the ceramics community in Minnesota , where we take pride in not letting the weather get the best of us - and in our pottery . The 2003 tour and sale will be held May 10-11 , Mother 's Day weekend . A few new guests will participate , including Dick Cooter from Two Harbors on the north shore of Lake Superior , invited by Briscoe ; Scott Goldberg from Maine , who will be joining two returnees , Jil Frank and Kirk Lyttle , both of St. Paul , at Christianson 's , along with Victoria Christen , now of Oregon , but a graduate ofthe University of Minnesota 's M.F.A. program .

Sidebar When I drove up the interstate to the Briscoes there were boats out on the lakes : it was the fishing season opener , with a million Minnesotans taking part .
