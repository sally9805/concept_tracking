PRO Absolutely . Government has no business interfering with what you eat By RADLEY BALKO <P> Nutrition activists are agitating for a panoply of initiatives that would bring the government between you and your waistline . President Bush earmarked $125 million in his budget for the encouragement of healthy lifestyles . State legislatures and school boards have begun banning snacks and soda from school campuses and vending machines . Several state legislators and Oakland , Calif. , Mayor Jerry Brown , among others , have called for a " fat tax " on high-calorie foods . Congress is considering menu-labeling legislation that would force chain restaurants to list fat , sodium and calories for each item . <P> That is precisely the wrong way to fight obesity . Instead of intervening in the array of food options available to Americans , our government ought to be working to foster a personal sense of responsibility for our health and well-being . <P> We 're doing just the opposite . For decades , America 's health-care system has been migrating toward nationalized medicine . We have a law that requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several states bar health insurers from charging lower premiums to people who stay fit . That removes the financial incentive for making healthy decisions . Worse , socialized health care makes us troublingly tolerant of government trespasses on our personal freedom . If my neighbor 's heart attack shows up on my tax bill , I 'm more likely to support state regulation of what he eats  --  restrictions on what grocery stores can put on their shelves , for example , or what McDonald 's can put between its sesame-seed buns . <P> The best way to combat the public-health threat of obesity is to remove obesity from the realm of " public health . " It 's difficult to think of a matter more private and less public than what we choose to put in our bodies . Give Americans moral , financial and personal responsibility for their own health , and obesity is no longer a public matter but a private one  --  with all the costs , concerns and worries of being overweight borne only by those people who are actually overweight . <P> Let each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're likely to make better decisions when someone else is n't paying for the consequences . <P> Radley Balko , based in Alexandria , Va. , is a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and a columnist for
