<p> Ah , honto kirei desu  --  how very beautiful ! " my mother exclaimed when the waitress brought the first kaiseki course at San Francisco 's Kyo-ya restaurant . As if taking in a beautiful sunset , Mother respectfully paused to study every aspect of the dish before picking up her chopsticks to eat . <p> When my first-generation Japanese parents visit me in San Francisco from the small rural town in Indiana where they live and I grew up , I show off the spoils of Bay Area living  --  like the abundance of Japanese ingredients available just a bus ride away from my front doorstep and the confectionery store in Japantown that sells the freshest omanju with a light dusting of mochi flour  --  just the way I like it . <p> This last visit I wanted to treat my mother to kaiseki , the multicourse Japanese dinner revered for its use of seasonal ingredients , spare portions and intricate presentation . <p> Mother taught me the fundamentals of this Japanese cuisine when , sparked by an air parcel from Japan , she would suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The parcel would be filled with ingredients hard to find in our Midwestern community  --  like the dried gourd rind kanpyoo , essential to making good dashi ( stock ) . She 'd also be inspired by the purchase of fresh shrimp from the fish market in Cincinnati or a special harvest from her backyard garden . <p> Kaiseki 's origins date back to the 16th century . Meaning " stone in the stomach , " kaiseki referred to the practice of Zen priests of tucking hot stones wrapped in towels into the bosom of their kimono sashes . The heat was intended to ward off any hunger pangs during their morning and afternoon prayers . Later , kaiseki became a simple seasonal vegetarian meal served after the chanoyu , or tea ceremony . Today , it is considered an art form that observes the harmony between food and nature , and takes the diner on an odyssey of flavors , textures and colors . <p> A traditional kaiseki meal consists of a set sequence of courses based on preparation techniques . Pickled , raw , grilled and fried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dishes focus on seasonal ingredients , and kaiseki chefs give zealous attention to presentation . <p> At the kaiseki dinner at Kyo-ya , Mother placed her chopsticks gracefully back on the porcelain rest , and I could tell she was done with the first course . Seated at a quiet corner , Mother and I could see , but not hear , the hustle and bustle of New Montgomery Street . Art academy students lugging art supply kits and large , awkward portfolio cases crossed paths with tourists returning to the adjoining Sheraton Palace Hotel . But our immediate surroundings were serene , and here , in my mother 's company , I recalled my first kaiseki dinner . <p> I was 13 years old and visiting Japan with my parents . We were staying at a ryokan , a traditional Japanese inn , in Hakone , several hours by train from Tokyo . It was mid-summer and the inn had no air-conditioning . Sandalwood fans and the occasional breeze offered some relief from the heat and humidity . <p> To keep cool , we wore loose blue and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot spring baths . So rather than dressing to eat at a restaurant , we stayed in our yukatas in our tatami suite , where a kimono-clad waitress delivered cold appetizers , plates of grilled fish , and platters of sashimi and sushi . <p> I was struck by the beauty within each delicate covered porcelain dish of my first kaiseki meal . In one dish , poached mushrooms topped with herbs had been carefully stacked to resemble a shrub on a stony hill , and Mother exclaimed " ooh " and " ah " to the waitress before popping the morsels into her mouth . Such beauty and flavors deserved respect , and I knew that that dinner I shared with Mother in the Japanese countryside would leave an indelible impression . <p> Now , all these years later , we were being served kaiseki once more . Our meal at Kyo-ya , prepared by executive chef Kuni Oshikawa , commemorated Girl 's Day , a holiday in Japan . Oshikawa enjoys experimenting with non-traditional ingredients , but adheres to the cardinal philosophies of traditional kaiseki . Like the acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes high and low chords yet harmonizes to create the whole . <p> Our meal opened with otoshi , a vinegary appetizer of crunchy udo root blended with snowbeans , a gingerlike bit of zingiber root ( myoga ) and tender squid topped with a zesty plum and miso dressing . The second dish offered a tasting of three bite-size morsels  --  a tiny fillet of jackfish and Japanese pepper leaf , which fulfills the mushimono , or steamed dish , requirement ; a doll-size bundle of red radish , asparagus and minty shiso leaf drizzled with a dark miso and sake dressing ; and a layered napa cabbage , salmon and shiso leaf appetizer . <p> Mother , who never acquired a taste for dairy products , raised an eyebrow at the tiny pat of cream cheese atop the cabbage . I found the combination delicious ; she did , too , but without the cream cheese . <p> The third course , called tsukuri  --  sliced raw fish  --  was fresh red snapper sashimi and raw shrimp decorated with daikon radish flowers and seaweed . A square buttercup yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pastel-colored shinbikiko ( tiny potato puffs ) dipped in a small mound of green tea salt . The fifth course was perfectly grilled yakimono  --  sliced steak  --  with a tart orange vinegar sauce displayed on lapis blue English china contrasting with seaweed garnishes in velvety browns , yellows , purples and greens . <p> Miso soup and rice generally make up kaiseki 's comforting late courses . But rather than serving a bowl of plain white rice , Oshikawa paid a last tribute to Girl 's Day by preparing a finale of " pink and red " avocado maki wrapped in tuna and whitefish rather than the traditional nori . <p> Dessert is usually a traditional sweet bean cake  --  or , as in Oshikawa 's recent Cherry Blossom kaiseki menu , milk jelly with ogura anko and Japanese syrup . Our dessert , accompanied by hot green tea , was a diminutive square of rose-colored sticky rice eaten with fragile wooden forks . <p> I had intended for this kaiseki dinner to show my mother that even exotic ingredients are available in San Francisco , and act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare all her Japanese meals by hand or wait months for key vegetables to ripen . It did both those things , but it wound up meaning more to me than that . <p> For me , kaiseki is more than the sum of pristine ingredients beautifully presented . I 've experienced many memorable meals  --  crisp Beijing duck in a local Chinese restaurant , an unforgettable platter of raw seafood in Paris  --  but at this meal I was overcome with the same feeling of newness and awe felt by that 13 year-old at her first kaiseki dinner . Like a plum blossom or a dewy gingko leaf , the memories of kaiseki with Mother would linger long after the meal was over . <p> FIRST COURSE : Bamboo , shrimp and shellfish nestle in Japanese pepper and miso sauce . <p> SECOND COURSE : Taranome vegetable , steamed sea urchin , wasabi eggplant , squid and sardines . <p> THIRD COURSE : Sashimi of tuna , yellowtail and squid topped with tobiko . <p> FOURTH COURSE : Spanish mackerel grilled in wasabi marinade with ginger sticks . <p> FIFTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> SIXTH COURSE : Salmon roe atop a Japanese pepper leaf and other dishes on this page were part of a recent kaiseki meal at Kyo-ya in San Francisco . <p> DESSERT COURSE : Milk jelly with ogura anko and Japanese syrup . <p> CHEF OSHIKAWA 'S DO 'S AND DON'TS FOR KAISEKI <p> Kuni Oshikawa of Kyo-ya in San Francisco offers some tips for the first-time kaiseki diner who , particularly with the first impressive course , may be hesitant to dig in . <p>  --  Items in bowls that have dressings and a variety of garnishes should be mixed together so all the flavors are evenly distributed . <p>  --  Avoid using the soy sauce on the table . Each kaiseki dish is specially seasoned , and adding soy sauce will throw off the balance of flavors . Also , avoid adding it to dipping sauces that accompany the dish . Often the soy sauce used in the dipping sauce is of superior quality . Ask your waitress for more . <p>  --  Rice wine and mirin ( sweet rice wine ) are essential ingredients in kaiseki , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , order a premium sake . These are made from polished rice and generally are sweeter than other sakes . Follow with a drier sake for the remainder of the meal . <p> The sake of the moment is a milky-colored unfiltered rice wine that is delicious throughout the entire meal . Champagne and sparkling wines also complement kaiseki . <p> KAISEKI RESTAURANTS <p> The following are among Bay Area restaurants that serve kaiseki meals . <p>  --  Fuki Sushi , 4119 El Camino Real ( near Page Mill Road ) , Palo Alto ; ( 650 ) 494-9383 .
