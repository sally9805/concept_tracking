THE WHEEL RUTS ARE STILL there , aimed west toward Oregon . <p> Drive to the south side of Boise , like I did the other day after I heard the news , and cross over the Americana Boulevard bridge and then go left into Ann Morrison Park . Pull into that parking lot with the cottonwoods all around it then walk down that bluff and into the green grass at the north edge of the park and you 'll see them for yourself : two shallow ruts , maybe six feet apart , running alongside the Boise River . A century and a half ago , Conestogas - a line of them that must have seemed to stretch all the way back to Missouri - filled those ruts all summer long , settlers heading to Oregon , looking for land and a good life in the Golden West . They knew where they were headed , and Boise was n't anything more than a day or two 's stopover on their way there . It was just a place to rest the oxen and buy some provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I thought I knew where I was headed , too , back in 1941. 1 figured Boise for a place where I 'd spend a few months before moving up to Columbus , Ohio , and then to St. Louis and the big time , joining the likes of Johnny Mize and Enos Slaughter and Terry Moore and those other Cardinals of the early 1940s . <p> I had a fastball with a lot of movement on it , you see , and I knew that was all I needed . Rear back and let ' er rip , just blow it right by them , that was my philosophy . <p> I came west from Decatur , Illinois , riding the old Union Pacific through Missouri and Nebraska and Wyoming and on into Idaho . Took me two days , what with changing trains in Denver and spending one miserable night sitting upright in the Pullman coach as we rattled through the Rockies . But I did n't mind the sleepless travel , I was eighteen years old and was going to be the next Bob Feller , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <p> Boise felt cool to me for the first day of June , after Illinois where it 'd been hot as blazes and limp-rag humid . I was met at the station by Jack McTaggart , the back-up catcher and player-manager for the Boise Pilots in the newly reformed Pioneer League . McTaggart was about five foot ten , wiry , with thinning brown hair under that fedora he wore . He was dressed in a suit , single-breasted with a belt in the back the way they wore them then . Under his left arm he carried , of all things , a catcher 's mitt , a new Rawlings Ernie Lombardi model . He did n't say why . <p> He seemed a nice enough guy at first , and normal as he could be . He was on the downside of a career that saw him playing for the Phillies and then the Redlegs for a few years . A good defensive catcher and decent hitter , he was one of those guys who was up for more than a cup of coffee but never quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making the shift to managing and Boise was his first stop on the road back to the big leagues . We shared that , I remember thinking that first day . Both of us out in the Wild West to get started on our new careers . Both of us thinking we knew where we were headed . <p> McTaggart got me to my boarding house , introduced me around to Mrs. O'Connor - Mother Mary , she said she liked to be called - and the other players who lived there : Andy Harrington , Gordie Williamson , Bob King , Marvin Rickert , and Eijii Sawamura . Sawamura had been a pitcher for the old Boise Rising Suns , a popular team there for a while in the mid1930s . Eijii was gone a couple of weeks after I showed up , called home by his family in Nagasaki . He was the first Japanese I ever met and I liked him a lot , he had a heck of a sense of humor . A couple of years later , less pleasantly , I met a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front room , going through the handshaking routine , when McTaggart stopped right in the middle of talking to a little group of us , held out his hand to tell us to be quiet and then took that glove out from under his arm and put it up to his ear , the mitt opened wide . <p> I was n't paying too much attention at first , too busy smiling and listening to Harrington warn me about Haydn Walker , the owner , who was , he said " a nice enough guy when he 's sober . But that ai n't often . " <p> I laughed at that , thinking he was joking , and then I saw McTaggart raise that hand again , listen to that mitt for a few seconds , then put the mitt in front of his mouth and start talking . " Joe , " he said , " Listen , kiddo , I know what they 're saying , but that 's not the way it is . You 're hitting the ball fine . Hell , you got a ten-game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused , put it back to his ear to listen again , then back to his mouth , saying , " There you go . Yeah , that 's what I figured . You 're coming around nicely , Joe , just keep swinging , okay ? And do n't worry about that stiff neck . You had the same thing last year , too , and it loosened up in the heat , right ? " He listened , nodded . " Well , it 'll be hot in St. Louis , Joey , always is . I think you 'll go on a tear . just keep those feet apart in your stance , right ? And bring those wrists through first , got it ? " <p> McTaggart listened , nodded again . " Yeah , Joe , no problem . I 'm here when you need me . Yeah , sure . Okay . Talk to you later , kiddo . " And he closed the mitt up and shoved it back under his left arm . <p> I looked at Harrington , the question on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , whirled his finger around his ear and whispered " He 's crazy as a loon , kid . Thinks he 's talking to DiMaggio . " <p> " Joe DiMaggio ? The Joe DiMaggio ? " <p> He laughed . " The very one , kid . " He put his arm over my shoulder . " Look , kid , Jack McTaggart 's a hell of a swell guy , but he 's got some strange habits , okay ? He reads all the damn time for one thing newspapers , magazines , history books . You 'd think he was a damn professor . <p> " And now there 's this thing with DiMaggio that 's been going on for the past week or so . Hell , Jack never hit better than.268 in six years in the big leagues , but he thinks DiMaggio needs his advice - not to mention they 're talking to each other through a catcher 's mitt . " He laughed , shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't think Jack even knows Joe Dee , to tell you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League . " <p> Then Harrington turned away from me , smiled and walked over to McTaggart to put his arm around his shoulders and start chatting about the Pilots and how much the kid - that 'd be me - could help the pitching rotation . <p> And I did help the rotation there at first . I was eighteen , with a rising fastball and a ton of confidence . I 'd been mowing them down back home , after all - star of my high-school team at Decatur Central High , and then getting great ink playing for the Central Illinois All-Stars in a tournament at St. Louis ' Heinie Meinie Field after I graduated . Heck , I threw a nohitter there in late May , and a one-hitter a couple of days later . That 's when Freddie Hawn , a scout for the Cardinals , came calling and now , here I Was a professional in the Cardinal organization , on loan to the Boise Pilots . <p> I got my first chance to pitch in the final game of three against the first-place Twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twohit shutout , with ten strike-outs and just one walk . I even had a stand-up double in the fourth to drive in one of our four runs . <p> Do you know what it 's like to be in control of agame like that ? There 's no feeling like it in the world . I knew , absolutely knew , I could get every batter out . My fastball was hopping , with Cowboys waving at it as it went by . I even got two strikeouts with my curve . Been eating my Wheaties , you know what I mean ? <p> The win tied us with Twin Falls for first place and I figured I was pretty damn swell . An hour later , when we climbed into our broken-down old Ford team bus after the game and headed toward Ogden for a pair of rainout double-headers , I was sure I was on my way to great things . The St. Louis fans would be screaming my name by August or September . <p> I could n't sleep for thinking about the game . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ground it through what gears it had left , up toward Sawtooth Pass and then down the other side on Route 83 into Ogden . There was great scenery out there somewhere , I remember thinking , but between the dirt on the inside of my window and the rain on the outside I could n't see any of it . <p> I was in the second row , behind Harrington , who had the knack for sleepingsoundly even in that bus . Dizzy with my own success , and maybe a little homesick , I sat back and tried to drift off , tried not to think too much about how glorious and wonderful my future in the game was certainly going to be if only I could make a few friends and not be quite so lonely . <p> Eyes closed , thinking about home , I heard someone softly talking . I looked up and it was McTaggart , holding his glove to his ear with his left hand while he drove that narrow mountain road in the rain with his right . He was talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , ai n't it just like I told ya , Joe ? " he was saying . " You just stay with it and it 'll come . That 's great , kid , just great . " <p> He put the glove to his ear for a moment , listened , then put it back in front of his mouth to speak again . " Three hits ? That 's great . You got those Yanks going now , Joey . I 'm telling you right now , you fellows are gon na have a great season . " <p> He listened some more , nodded . " Yeah , that 's just swell , Joe . Doubleheader tomorrow ? Yeah , for us , too , down in Ogden . Yeah , we won tonight , the kid pitcher did a heckuva job , I think maybe he 's a prospect . " <p> He listened again , then moved the glove back and ended with , " Yeah , you , too , Joey . Knock ' ern dead . Yeah , and keep that stance wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " <p> And McTaggart set the glove down to the side of his seat and put both hands back on the wheel before leaning forward to peer through the windshield wipers as they pushed the water around on the glass . We were through the pass now and heading steeply downhill on that slick , narrow mountain road . I wanted to ask McTaggart about what was going on . I wanted to find out if he was mad as a hatter , crazy for talking to Joe DiMaggio through his glove in the middle of the Utah rain . But I did n't ask , he was concentrating hard on keeping us on the road and I did n't want my curiosity to kill us all . And then the moment passed and Harrington woke up and started talking to me about developing a change-up and then , finally , as we drove along the edge of the Great Salt Lake and on into Ogden , I managed to catch a couple of hours sleep . <p> When we got to our hotel in Ogden I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there it was , top headline on the back sports page : " DiMaggio 's three hits beat Browns . " <p> I did n't know what to make of that . <p> After breakfast , I got a couple more hours sleep in the Golden Spike Hotel and then it was time to get to the ballpark for our double-header . I got there early , that 's the only way for a kid pitcher to get any cuts at all in batting practice . In the clubhouse - a new place , but bare , with a concrete slab floor and some wooden benches and an open wooden locker for each of us , nails tapped into the sides and backs - I sat there and pulled on my sanitaries and then my red Pilots socks with the three white stripes , rolling the socks and the bottom of my pants and the sanitaries all together up near the top of the calf . I was at the stage of my career then when just putting on the uniform was a thrill . <p> McTaggart came by as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on kid , I want to watch you take a few swings , " he said , and then he walked me through the tunnel and into the dugout and that bright Utah sunshine . It was hot , with the wind blowing in from the desert and the salt lake ; the air so humid and salty you could feel the stuff on your skin and taste it in the air . <p> I stepped into the cage to hit a few and McTaggart talked for a minute or two about my swing , about how I needed to level it off and tighten it up some , that I was n't ever going to be hitting home runs and I should worry about singles . <p> I 'd hit that double off the wall the night before , but I was n't going to say anything to him . He was the skipper and I was the rookie and if there was anything I 'd learned in just two weeks of being a professional , it was to keep my mouth shut . <p> And then , asI swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said this to me : <p> " Kid , I know you was awake last night when I was talking to Joe . " I did n't say anything . <p> " Joe and I was roommates back in ' 33 , with the San Francisco Seals , " he said . " Joe was having some trouble at the plate and asked me to take a look at his swing . Well , I thought he had a hitch in there , and then was trying to catch up with it , punching at the ball instead of swinging through . We worked on it some , and ...... <p> " And he went on that streak , " I said , stepping back from the plate . I turned to look at McTaggart . " Everyone knows about that , when he hit in 61 straight . That 's the professional record . " <p> " You got it , kid , " McTaggart said , and turned to spit out a big hunk of tobacco . " He 's trusted me ever since , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all it is , just a little free advice . I keep up with how he 's doing and I give him some advice here and there . " <p> " Sure , " I said , thinking about how all that good advice was being sent through the deep pocket of a Rawlings catcher 's mitt . I did n't know what else to say , so I just stepped back into the box and waited for the next pitch from Harrington to come into me , straight down the middle , perfectly understandable . See the ball . Hit the ball . It 's a simple game , really . <p> That evening I spent the first game in the bullpen , waiting for the weather to cool down some and watching us lose the opener , 3- 1 , on a long home run off a sweet swing by Swish Nicholson , a guy who earned his nickname a couple of years later with the Cubs when he hit twenty-nine of them . <p> The nightcap I spent in the dugout , right next to McTaggart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him what I saw , the strengths and weaknesses . That was harmless enough , and even got to be pretty interesting as Howie Petersen pitched a good game at them , keeping a shutout going through the first five . Then the catcher 's mitt rang in McTaggart 's head and it all got strange . <p> We were watching Petersen get behind in the count in the first two hitters he faced that inning before getting them both to fly out to left . When he went 2-0 on the third guy with a couple of breaking balls , one outside and one in the dirt , I figured it was time for serious worry ; but McTaggart sat up like he 'd heard something the rest of us could n't find on any radio dial and then he picked up that mitt and gave it a listen . <p> He nodded . " Sure , Joe , " he said , " Yeah , he 's got that sloppy curve and then he 'll try to run it in on you with the fastball . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and then go for the pump , okay ? " <p> Petersen came in with a fastball and the guy drilled it , foul , to left . At least it was a strike . <p> " Sure , Joe , " McTaggart was saying , " But you got to go down and get that fastball and knock it right out of there , okay ? " <p> He paused , listened . Petersen , working fast , came in with another curve in the dirt . Ball three . " Joey , " McTaggart was saying into his glove , " you got to trust me , he 'll come in with that fastball down and in , you just be ready . " <p> He listened again , nodding . Petersen came in one more time with the curve , in the dirt and outside for a walk . <p> " Joe , " McTaggart said , " I got to get out there and talk to my pitcher . Stay on the line . I 'll be right back . " He handed me the catcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe while I get out there and settle Howie down , all right ? " <p> I stated at him . <p> " Just say hi , kid . He wo n't bite , " he said , and walked up the dugout steps and out onto the field . <p> I held the mitt to my ear . There was nothing . " Hi , " I said , figuring it could n't hurt . Still nothing . <p> " Mr. DiMaggio ? " I tried . Silence , but then McTaggart , halfway out to the mound turned back to look at me , put his hands out , palms up as if to ask me how the conversation was going . I shrugged , shook my head slightly . <p> He frowned . " Keep him on the line , kid , " he yelled , and then turned back to stride out to where Petersen stood there , the ball in his hand , waiting for him . <p> So I tried again . " Um , Mr. DiMaggio , this is Delbert Potter . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he 's our manager here - he says I should say hi and keep you on the line for a couple of minutes . He 's out talking to our pitcher right now and he handed me this , um , glove ..... " <p> The dugout was awfully quiet . I stopped talking into the mitt and looked down the bench . They were all looking at me , some of them grinning . I looked out toward the mound and McTaggart was walking back . He was giving Petersen one more hitter to get things straightened out . <p> " How 's it going , kid ? " he asked me as he reached the top of the dugout steps . <p> I put up my hand to shush him , listened intently to the mitt for a second , then put the pocket of the mitt close to my mouth , said " Yes , sir , Mr. DiMaggio . Absolutely . I 'll tell him you said so . Yes , sir . And good luck today . That 's right , fastball , low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he says . " I gave it a listen again , then " And thank you , Mr. DiMaggio . Okay , then . Thank you , Joe . " <p> And I pulled the mitt away from my face , folded it together and tossed it up to McTaggart . " It 's going fine , Skip , " I said . " Mr. DiMaggio - Joe says thanks for the tip . He 'll be watching for that fastball . " <p> " That 's great , kid . Thanks , " said McTaggart , catching the mitt as he came down the steps before plopping down on the bench . " Now let 's see what old Howie can do here with the bottom of their line-up . " <p> Howie , it turned out , could n't do much , We lost the first game , and then the second , too , to fall out of that tie for first . <p> DiMaggio , in St. Louis , had three home runs and a double off the Browns . <p> IT WENT ON LIKE THAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that catcher 's mitt with me acting like some sort of receptionist when McTaggart could n't talk , chatting away with the glove like it all was for real , then listening while McTaggart gave Joe Dee plenty of advice on how to handle things as the whole nation started paying attention - a lot of attention - to The Streak . <p> There was a war going on in Europe , we knew , and the Japanese were marching all around China . War fever had even reached into Boise , with B-25 bombers practicing their bombing runs from Gowen Field , the big new airbase just half-a-mile past the ballpark 's leftfield fence . <p> But baseball is what mattered , from our struggles to hang onto first place in the Pioneer League to Jack McTaggart holding that big , floppy Rawlings mitt up to chat with DiMaggio about how to keep that streak going . <p> When Joe broke the Yankee record of twenty-nine games on a bad-hop single that ate up Luke Appling at short for the White Sox , it was McTaggart on the mitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , too , could tell Joe way-to-go . <p> When Bob Muncrief , a rookie right-hander for the Brownies , had Joe stymied the whole game it was McTaggart who told Joe not to worry , he figured the kid would n't walk Joe in the eighth but would pitch to him out of pride , and he was right . Joe singled to save the streak . In the next day 's Boise Statesman I read where Muncrief said , " I was n't going to walk him . That would n't have been fair - to him or to me . " <p> When the Yankees were finally in first place a couple of days later and playing at home , McTaggart was on the mitt with Joe as Tommy Henrich came up with a man on and one out . McTaggart told Joe not to worry about a double-play , Henrich would bunt the man over to help out and sure enough that 's what happened . Henrich asked Joe McCarthy if he could bunt and McCarthy said yes . The sacrifice moved the runner over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streak going . <p> it went on like that for weeks , the guys finding it pretty funny there for a while . Eventually , though , the sportswriters in Boise found out about it - from Harrington , I think - and it all got pretty sour . Most guys thought the joke had gone on way too long , and it was taking attention away from the field , where we were playing pretty good and in a race for the Pioneer League pennant . <p> McTaggart never let on the whole time whether he even knew we all thought it was just a prank . As far as he seemed to be concerned , it was all very simple , Joe DiMaggio needed his advice and he was happy to help . Giving advice , after all , was what he did for a living , as he told me often enough . <p> One afternoon , we stood out in the bullpen and he worked on teaching me how to throw a change-up while those bombers roared behind us . " It 's all about keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can change speeds , it 'll make that fastball of yours look a little faster and give them hitters something else to think about . " <p> I nodded , took the ball from him and tried one , sliding the ball back from the fingertips and in toward the knuckles , like he 'd taught me . It worked , but I did n't have much control with it and told him so . <p> " That 'll come , " he said , and then he smiled . " Look , kid , you got smarts , and that counts for a lot in this game , especially when you 're pitching . Guy like you , you got to outsmart the hitter , know what I mean ? " <p> I nodded again - only later did it dawn on me what he 'd really been telling me about my physical tools - and then I tried a few more . I could tell the change would help me , and Lord knew I needed the help . I thanked him , after I finally got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , hell , kid , do n't thank me for doing my job , " he said . " I 'm supposed to be a coach , remember ? I 'm supposed to help kids like you learn to play this game a little . " Then he 'd grinned suspiciously . " Plus , I 'm supposed to win some , too , and damned if we 're not doing that , right , kid ? " <p> He turned around and watched a bomber coming in for a landing . " You ever think - bout history , kid ? " <p> " I can tell you who led the National League in hitting every year this century , " I said , " just try me . " <p> He smiled . " I bet you can , kid . But what I was wondering about was this war we 're heading into . Going to be some history made . Might not be too long before them pilots find themselves dropping the real thing instead of sacks of flour , you know what I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that ? " I asked . The way McTaggart read every newspaper he could get his hands on I figured he knew what he was talking about . Me , I had n't read anything but the sports page in maybe my whole life . <p> " Yeah , kid , I do . I ai n't got much of an education , but it looks to me like we 're going to be in this thing one way or another , and soon . And I 'll tell you what , we wo n't be out here playing ball if the whole country goes to war , you can count on that . There 'll be more important things than baseball . " <p> " What 'll we do , then ? " <p> " Ballplayers ? " He shrugged . " Go fight , I guess . Would n't that be a mess ? " <p> " Sure would , " I agreed , thinking mostly of myself . <p> He turned his back on the bombers and looked back into the field . " Hell , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? Joe 's going to get his made with this streak . Me and you , who knows ? How you going to make the history books , kid ? " <p> A month before I 'd have answered with something about being in the Hall of Fame . But now I was n't so sure . The Pilots were winning , sure , fighting it out for first all the way with Twin Falls and then , later , with Ogden , too . But my pitching had gone south as the hitters caught up with my fastball and learned to sit on my curve . After a couple more real disasters as a starter , by early July I was in the bullpen in middle relief , trying to get my confidence back and get the ball over the plate , reduced to hoping a new change-up would cure my ills . <p> Somewhere along the line I realized I was in a terrible rut - like those tracks out past the left-field fence in Airway Park in Boise . <p> The field was new , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to play there once I 'd seen the other parks in the league . But just beyond the fence ran those wheel ruts of the Oregon Trail . I walked in them all the time , they were on my way to the park from Mrs. O'Connor 's boarding house . Walking along , knee-deep in ruts that began in Missouri and kept on going all the way to the Willamette Valley in Oregon , I could picture those wagons moving along slowly , steadily to whatever waited for them , following that trail like there were no options to go anywhere else , do it any other way . They must have been hell to get out of , those ruts . I know mine were - the fastball getting ripped , my curve not fooling anyone , my new change-up too little too late . I wanted to just pack it up , leave go of it all and head home to Decatur . <p> Through everything I kept helping McTaggart talk to Joe , listening in as McTaggart said Joe Dee should swing on that 3-0 count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , then hearing McTaggart relay Joe 's description of how he 'd slapped a double off Dutch Leonard to tie Sisler 's record . <p> And I anguished with them both when DiMaggio 's favorite bat was stolen between games of that crucial double-header in Washington . <p> I was out on the mound , struggling to get through the fifth inning at home against Lewiston , the last-place team , when McTaggart got that call . I 'd walked the first two men I faced , then dropped down a gear to get it over the plate and given up a triple off the wall , then walked the next guy . Finally , the guy after that hit a scorcher to short , but Tommy Seals at second turned it into a slick double-play that got me some outs but cost me a run . I looked into the dugout to see how McTaggart was taking it all , and he was talking to that catcher 's mitt . <p> I was a wreck , all the craziness of that long , hot Boise summer running around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood there , looking at McTaggart , willing him to notice me out there , have some pity on me , take me out , send me home , end all this misery . Instead , when I needed him most to be my manager he was talking to that glove . <p> I glared at him until Harrington , sitting next to him , noticed me and elbowed him . He looked up , frowned , then stood up , climbed those dugout steps and waved at the ump for a time-out as he walked toward me , that catcher 's mitt tucked away like always under his left arm . <p> " What 's up , kid ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't have it , Skip . I think maybe , well , you know ... " I said lamely , handing him the ball . <p> " You know what , kid , " he said . " Somebody stole Joe 's bat between games of that doubleheader . " <p> " Oh , Christ Almighty . " I was a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to use the Lord 's name in vain . But I could n't believe it . Here I was in the middle of a real mess and all McTaggart could talk about was DiMaggio and that damn streak . <p> He could see how mad I was at him , but it did n't faze him . Instead , he just smiled , said , " Hey , kid , hang on a second . I got to tell Joe something . " And he put the catcher 's mitt up to his face to talk . <p> " Tell Joe something ! " I yelled at him , reaching out to pull the glove away , all the worries and the anxieties and the fear boiling up out of me at last . " Why do n't you tell me something , McTaggart ? For Christ 's sake , man , I 'm trying to pitch to these guys and all you want to do is talk into that damn mitt ! " <p> He just smiled . " That 's good , kid . Nice to see some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball . " Now let 's see if that new change-up works , " he said , and put the glove back up to his face , mumbling into the pocket as he turned around to walk back to the dugout . <p> I turned around to stare at my teammates , all of them looking at me , slapping their fists into their gloves , shouting encouragement like this was all just an ordinary part of the game . <p> All right , then . <p> I stood there for a moment , my career in a shambles before it ever got started , my manager talking to Joe DiMaggio through his mitt while I watched my dreams blow away in that hot summer breeze . <p> And then I started to pitch , buzzing the first one high and tight , giving the Idaho Falls batter a nice , clean shave for ball three . Then a curveball for strike two , and then that change-up , fat and right down the middle , but looking faster than it was so the guy swung early and hit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lofting a lazy flyball to left , where Mel Nelson caught it without taking a step . <p> From the mound , I could hear McTaggart in the dugout , saying " I 'm telling you , Joe , the bat 's in Newark . And I got friends in Newark . I 'll call ' ern and you 'll have the bat back tomorrow , Joe , swear to god . " <p> And the bat , I read in the sports page later , really was in Newark , and Joe did get it back and keep the streak going . And darned if I did n't win that game , too , 7-5 , for my third - and last - professional win . <p> It all ended a couple of weeks later , on July 17 in Pocatello . I was on the mound in relief again . Jack Coates , our catcher , was sitting it out , so McTaggart was behind the plate , trying to teach me a few things while he could . <p> I was still mad as a hornet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations with Joe Dee , I had n't played any of those stupid tricks with the DiMaggio mitt since that night back in Boise . But he ignored all that and treated me like everything was copacetic , smiling and grinning and telling me how great my stuff was . That just made me madder , and I reared back harder , putting about everything I had into that fastball and shaking off the sign every time he called for a curve or a change-up . Hell , I figured I 'd just fire away at him . And it felt good , to tell you the truth , though the Pocatello hitters were hammering me and I was having a hard time protecting a six-run lead we 'd built up in the first four innings . <p> In the sixth it started getting obvious . Pocatello 's number-three hitter slapped a sharp liner to left that landed in front of Nelson . Then the next guy took a couple of strikes before I shook off the sign for the change and came in with my best fastball and he ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten us out of the inning , but McTaggart could n't hold onto it , and on the next pitch the guy went to the pump with a towering home run that 's still up there somewhere sailing through the Idaho night sky looking for some mountain peak to plow into . <p> McTaggart came out to talk to me , clanking up to me in that beat-up catcher 's gear , his mask up on top of his head , his glove on his left hand . <p> " Got that one up some , " he said , and I nodded . I figured he 'd be talking to DiMaggio any second now , the streak was up to fifty-six and going strong . <p> I was feeling mean . " You should 've hung onto that third strike . We had that guy . " <p> McTaggart smiled thinly , held up the Rawlings mitt . The web was tom from between the thumb and first finger , the leather lacing dangling there . " Did n't realize it until just now , kid . That foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry . " <p> " Yeah , me too , kid . " He held the glove up to his ear . " It ai n't working so I can talk to Joe , either . " He shook his head . " Too bad . I got a bad feeling about Joe today . " <p> " Sure , " I said , " a bad feeling . " <p> " And I got a bad feeling about your stuff , too , kid . I think they got you figured out . I 'm gon na bring in Townie . We got to protect this lead and win this one . " <p> I nodded . I knew I was done . Hell , I 'd known I was done for the past month . If I could n't get anybody out in the Pioneer League , I sure as hell was n't going to be striking them out for the Cardinals any day soon . <p> And so I went to the bench , and then into the showers , and , just a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , DiMaggio was up against Al Smith , a veteran leftie . Bob Feller would face him the next night , and most people figured Feller could stop the streak if anyone could . <p> But Smith got the job done : a nice play at third by Ken Keltner , a walk , another nice play at third by Keltner , and then a groundball into a doubleplay and that was it . <p> In Boise , McTaggart worked on fixing that mitt between innings and got it done in five minutes , but he said it did n't work anymore . Not that it mattered . By the time our game was in the fifth , the Yankee game - and DiMaggio 's streak - was over . <p> By September I was back on the farm in Illinois , worrying about soybeans and corn instead of Joe Dee and Jack McTaggart 's catcher 's mitt . While I was out standing knee deep in corn furrows , DiMaggio went right back on another good streak and the Yankees won the pennant , seventeen games in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Andy Harrington that Jack McTaggart died at Okinawa . He was top turret gunner and flight engineer on a B-25 and they were attacking Japanese gun implacements on the beach , flying in so low that their props cut a wake through the lagoon . When they pulled up to drop their bombs some enemy sharpshooter - who knows , maybe Eijii Sawamura - got at them with anti-aircraft fire and that was that . <p> McTaggart and the others could n't get out in time , and so they all made it into the history books as part of the price the country paid . I bet McTaggart wished , right there at the end , that he had that catcher 's mitt with him , that it worked again and he could talk to Joe one last time before they went into the water . <p> I can see that in my mind , see him talking to Joe , saying goodbye as the plane 's right wing caught the water , sending the plane careening in and breaking up over the reef-line . <p> As for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing about the real heroes as they waded ashore at Guadalcanal and le Shima . I met a lot of ballplayers along the way , guys ripping out the heart of their careers to do the right thing for themselves , for their country ; guys making history . I never ran into DiMaggio in all those years or anytime after , even though he was doing his duty , too . <p> After the war I took advantage of the GI Bill and got my college degree and wound up teaching high-school history classes and coaching the baseball team at Decatur Central , back where I 'd started . <p> I helped some good kids along the way , and a few of them even made the bigs . If you ever saw Del Unser roam the outfield for the Phillies you saw one of my best . And if you watched Bobby Gamin throw his no-no against the Mets in ' 74 , you saw lack McTaggart 's change-up in action . I taught it to Gamin eight years before and he took us to the state title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know - I always knew - that Jack McTaggart was crazy as a loon and none of that happened the way it seemed to be happening . Joe Dee could have cleared all that up for me just by looking at what I could show him , by putting the mitt on his left hand and chuckling a little and telling me it had n't happened that way . <p> But I did n't really want to know , not like that . What I wanted , what I 've kept alive , is the thought that maybe it really did happen that way , that my season in Boise was part of something important , something that mattered . <p> And that catcher 's mitt ? McTaggart gave it to me when I got on the train heading home , said he thought I 'd earned that much , at least . <p> Now it sits here , looking comfortable in my bookcase , right there next to the picture of me and the kids after we won state , Bobby Gamin holding up that trophy and grinning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agood , long run with this game , with this life . I married agood woman and we had fifty years together . She died a couple of years ago , so I 'm lonely again the way I was in 194 1 ; but we did fine while she was here - four kids , a pack of grandkids , even a great-grandson who looks to me like a natural hitter . <p> I travel some now , trying to stay busy and interested in things . I get up to St. Louis a lot for Cardinal games , and once or twice a summer I head to Chicago to see the Cubs . <p> I went west , to Boise , after I head that DiMaggio had died . I made a nice little vacation out of it ; saw the mountains , saw how big the city had become , walked along those wagon-wheel ruts in Ann Morrison Park , thinking about Jack McTaggart and Joe Dee and the way things were back then . And then I came on home to Decatur . <p> Every now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mitt up , fiddle with the laces some , pound my fist into the pocket a few times . Then I start talking , chatting with McTaggart and DiMaggio , pretending that they can hear me , pretending that they care about what I have to say about teaching kids the game . <p> I put the glove to my ear now and then for a quick listen , but the old mitt has nothing much to say to me . Except for this one remarkable thing : 56 games , from May 15 to July 17 , from a single off White Sox pitcher Edgar Smith to a double-play against the Indians , Boudreau flipping the ball to Mack to get it started . A .357 average that year , with thirty home runs , forty-three doubles , eleven triples . You can look all that up . It 's in the history books , where it belongs , where it will probably be forever . <p> Author Affiliation
