<p> Bush renews warning : U.S. has ' zero tolerance ' for deception on inpections <p> New deadline looms : Iraq letter denies hiding weapons ; list due Dec. 8 <p> A trigger for war : Any Iraqi failure to comply could lead to U.S. invasion <p> *** <p> WASHINGTON  --  Iraq dodged the prospect of immediate war with the United States on Wednesday when it accepted a new United Nations resolution ordering Baghdad to comply with weapons inspections or face " serious consequences . " <p> Saddam Hussein 's decision to allow U.N . inspectors to return to Iraq for the first time since 1998 only begins the process , however . There will be other potential crisis points in the weeks to come  --  deadlines that could ultimately lead Washington and its allies to invade Iraq to force compliance . <p> The next possible trigger for war : Iraq 's insistence , reiterated in Wednesday 's letter accepting the inspections , that it has no weapons of mass destruction . Washington insists Iraq is lying . <p> And Baghdad faces a Dec. 8 deadline to declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure Iraq still has . If Iraq 's declaration fails to match a U.S. list of suspected weapons sites , the Bush administration could view that as provocation for an invasion . <p> U.S. officials say they believe that there is virtually no chance Iraq will fully comply with the resolution adopted by a 15-0 vote in the U.N . Security Council on Friday . Instead , the question reverberating through the Bush administration is whether to wait weeks or months to allow Saddam to build a pattern of deception or omission  --  or to push for war much sooner if Iraq defies any of the measure 's key demands . <p> " Zero tolerance is about as plain as I can make it . We will not tolerate any deception or denial or deceit , " President Bush said Wednesday . " I have told the United Nations we 'll be glad to consult with them , but the resolution does not prevent us from doing what needs to be done . " <p> Bush has signed off on plans for a military strike against Iraq that would use as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize key locations and pressure Saddam to fold . The Pentagon already is moving forces into position . The Navy has two aircraft carriers within striking range of Iraq , B-2 stealth bombers are being prepared for deployment in the Indian Ocean and other U.S. warplanes are in Qatar , Kuwait and Bahrain . <p> Pentagon officials say no National Guard or reserve units currently have mobilization orders for the Middle East . Pentagon sources , however , say a number of units have been told they could be called up for overseas duty or to fill in at home for U.S. units that are sent overseas . <p> But despite their tough rhetoric and advanced war planning , administration officials privately admit it 's hard to know ahead of time what level of Iraqi obstructionism will be dramatic enough to energize a skittish world community to take military action or to quell any doubts among Americans . <p> The Iraqis " are going to try to drag their feet , to make this very complicated and difficult , " says Lee Feinstein , a foreign policy analyst at the non-partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Clinton administration . " But at the end of the day , the only chip Saddam has is his own survival and leadership , and he wants to preserve that . And if he sees there is no fooling around this time , that 's the best way to get him to comply . " <p> The nine-page letter of acceptance that Iraq 's ambassador to the U.N. , Mohammed Al-Douri , turned over to U.N . Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday removed the most obvious tripwire for a U.S.-led military strike . The resolution had set a deadline this Friday for Iraq to accept new inspections . <p> " The letter says that Iraq will deal with Security Council resolution 1441 despite its bad contents , " Al-Douri said . " We are eager to see ( inspectors ) perform their duties in accordance with international law as soon as possible . " <p> Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri signed the letter , much of which was devoted to rambling and harsh attacks on the " gang of evil "  --  the United States and Britain , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annan , who was making a two-day visit to Washington when Iraq 's acceptance was announced , said the letter 's combative tone was meaningless . " I think the issue is not their acceptance but performance on the ground , " the U.N . leader said . " Let the inspectors go in , and I urge the Iraqis to cooperate with them and to perform . " <p> Iraq 's parliament , which has no independent power and is largely a rubber stamp for Saddam , unanimously rejected the resolution earlier this week . But U.S. officials dismissed that action as political theater and expected Saddam to accept the measure . The acceptance was announced on Iraqi state-run television and radio Wednesday night . <p> White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the administration remains skeptical of Iraq 's intention to comply with the resolution . <p> " We 've heard this before from Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime , " he said . " Now we need to see it by Saddam Hussein 's actions . The onus continues to be on Saddam Hussein . This is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the deadlines laid out in the resolution should quickly give the world a good idea of how Saddam plans to respond to this latest challenge . Key dates : <p> * On Monday , an advance team of 24 U.N . inspectors  --  led by chief U.N . weapons inspector Hans Blix and Mohammed ElBaradei , the head of the U.N . ' s International Atomic Energy Agency  --  is scheduled to arrive in Baghdad to re-open its offices . <p> * A spokeswoman for the team said inspections could begin as soon as Nov. 25 ; the resolution calls for inspections to begin no later than Dec. 23 . How Iraq handles those early inspections , U.S. officials say , will be a key indicator of Saddam 's strategy . <p> * By Feb. 21 , Blix and ElBaradei are required to report back to the council . Before that , however , they must report to New York immediately if Iraq does not comply . <p> * On Dec. 8 , the resolution requires Baghdad to deliver a complete accounting of its nuclear , chemical and biological weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . secretary-general Wednesday , Sabri reiterated Iraq 's contention that it has no such weapons ; he calls Bush 's allegation " the biggest and most wicked slander against Iraq , supported by malicious intent and spearheaded in word and malevolence by his lackey ( British Prime Minister ) Tony Blair . " <p> That raises the possibility of a major confrontation next month over the U.N . demand that Iraq outline all its weapons systems . <p> The Iraqi denial was n't surprising to veterans of the inspection process . " From 1995 on , ( the Iraqis ) have stuck to the argument that they are disarmed , " says Ewen Buchanan , the spokesman for the U.N . inspectors . <p> He says it is " too early to tell " whether the Iraqis will submit an unsatisfactory declaration of weapons programs . " We hope they would use the opportunity to declare what they have not declared in the past , " Buchanan says . <p> The Bush administration has claimed repeatedly that Iraq has continued to develop nuclear weapons while maintaining chemical and biological agents since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Iraq makes false statements in its declaration , it could be cause for war . <p> ' Material breach ' <p> The resolution says any " false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq . . . shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq 's obligations . " <p> The resolution requires that the council meet to assess Iraq 's non-compliance but does not specifically call for a second resolution to approve the use of force . Washington believes that the resolution sanctions the use of force against Iraq whether the council gives further approval or not . <p> The problem for the administration is what level of non-compliance tips the scales for war . In the Iraqi weapons statement due Dec. 8 , for example , experts believe Iraq is virtually certain not to disclose all its weapons programs . That leaves the administration with the choice of going back to the council and using U.S. intelligence findings to prove Baghdad wrong , or biding its time and establishing a pattern of Iraqi non-compliance . <p> Patrick Clawson , deputy director of the Washington Institute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a ' gotcha ' moment when we catch the Iraqis red-handed . " He and Rolf Ekeus , a former chief U.N . weapons inspector , believe the Iraqis will only declare the programs it thinks the United States knows about . <p> " It 's quite obvious we will get into a twilight situation , " Ekeus told the institute earlier this week . He said Iraq 's Dec. 8 list would include previously declared sites , but the problem would come with so-called dual-use facilities that produce detergents and rat poisons but can be easily reconfigured to make chemical and biological weapons . <p> " I would be surprised if we can declare Iraq in material breach and go to war over the failure to declare a detergent factory , " Ekeus said . <p> Judith Yaphe , an Iraq expert at the National Defense University , also predicts that Saddam will not reveal any new sites and that it might be difficult for inspectors to find incriminating evidence . " The Iraqis have had four years and several months of warning that this was coming , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's doubtful there 's anything obvious lying out there . " <p> She predicts Saddam will be confrontational about the inspections , hampering access to presidential compounds , for example . After confrontations between Iraqis and inspectors in the last round of inspections , those sites were put off limits to surprise inspections under a 1998 deal between Iraq and the United Nations . " For Saddam , it 's retreating into a classic pattern , " she says . <p> Feinstein , of the Council on Foreign Relations , a think tank based in New York , urges the administration to exercise patience and allow Saddam to build a record of non-compliance that will be undeniable to the rest of the world . <p> As a result of last week 's U.S. congressional elections  --  which gave Republicans control of both the House of Representatives and Senate  --  and the unanimous vote on the U.N . resolution , " the administration comes into this situation with great strength , which means they can afford to be patient and no one will accuse them politically of weakness or indecisiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 've been doing and patiently focus on the key issue  --  which is disarmament .
