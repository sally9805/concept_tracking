No trees . No telephones . No Jesus . The higher you travel into the mountains barricading the Balck Sea coast of Turkey and on into Georgia 's Caucasus , the less there is . In remote valleys and along steep stony tracks now forced to serve as roads , familiar components of life fall away one by one . What remains is the immensity of the sky , gaunt slopes scrubby with thistles and wild grasses , the roar of glacial torrents in dark ravines , and the powerful pull of the first gods ever feared by men . In the 14th century B.C. a young Greek named Jason built a boat called the Argo and summoned 50 warriors to join him in a voyage from Greece to the edge of the known world : Colchis , a territory that in the past covered much of the western part of modern Georgia and stretched along the Black Sea coast from the Caucasus to Trabzon . Here a golden fleece hung on an oak tree guarded by a serpent that never slept , and the Argonauts swore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Colchian king . What it took to fulfill this vow , the oaths and offerings and fatal magic spells , became one of the ancient world 's best known myths . Of course Jason never existed ; that was why it was necessary to invent him . Anyone listening to this tale when it was finally written down in the third century B.C. recognized the deeper theme , which had nothing to do with witch-princesses or the will of the gods and everything to do with the saga of Greek settlement of the Black Sea coast . This was dangerous territory , known even today for sudden storms and notorious , at least to those who recounted the myth , for savage tribes and barbaric customs . Yet the Greeks slowly established a string of cities along Turkey 's northern coast and northeastward into Colchis , the ideal connection points for trade by sea and by land . The Greeks , though , were only part of a long and complicated history here . Early humans appeared in Georgia around 1.8 million years ago . Now , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customs and symbols of the cultures whence they came : pagan and Christian , Jewish and Muslim , Persian and Mesopotamian , Arab and Roman and Russian . Only life on the narrow strip of plain along Turkey 's eastern Black Sea coast , connected by land and sea with the world beyond , has kept up with the calendar , modernized along with its roads , vehicles , and general outlook . Otherwise the rugged mountain hinterland of both eastern Turkey and Georgia belongs to an unusual degree to the past . Regardless of variations in language and dress , from the Laz , Hemsin , Cepni , and Rum of Turkey to the Svan , Tush , and Khevsur in Georgia , the people share roots that strike deep into history . Theirs is still the world of sacred honor , blood sacrifice , revenge , the tending of animals , the grinding toil of women . WELCOME TO MY HOUSE , " said Khvicha Sisauri , a Tush shepherd , as we entered his kitchen . " Shall I kill a sheep ? " Something in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " Great idea ! " I said , and he went outside . Almost immediately I could hear him whetting his knife . When company comes to the mountains of Georgia , people take it seriously . A guest is sacred , sent by God , so that as soon as you are under the roof of one person , you are protected by his entire family , down to the eighth cousin twice removed . I had been looking apprehensively at the mountains that marked the border with Chechnya , but not to worry : " The guest , " Guram Kvirkvelia , my archaeologist interpreter , told me with complete seriousness , " will be the last person to die . " Guram and I , with archaeologist Giorgi Gogochuri , had reached Tusheti after laboring for hours up tortuous switchbacks and precipitous rocky ruts over a 13,000-foot pass in Khvicha 's indomitable Russianmade four-wheel drive . The next day we would travel on to a village named Pharsma to join in the celebration of St. George 's feast . Though practices differ to some degree among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the offering of sheep , beer and bread , a lavish communal meal , a horse race , and the strict exclusion of women from the sacred precinctsall customs that Jason 's Argonauts would have recognized . Also , I learned , St. George would be the festival honoree in name only . Despite the fact that most Georgians are Orthodox Christians , the real divinity accepting the sacrifices would be the local spirit , called khati . " Khati means icon in Old Georgian , " explained Guram , whose expertise is late Bronze Age and classical Colchis . " But the khan is a pagan deity , and all practices about him are pagan . The village priest is a common man , not elected and not chosen by descendant line . It 's the will of the khati who becomes the priest , and the choice is revealed to the village seer . " Instead of a church each village has a stone house within a sacred area chosen by the khati . There the ritual beer and bread are made ; there the sheep are sacrificed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and not to be trifled with . " The khati of the Khevsur can be angry sometimes , " said Giorgi , referring to his own fierce people in the mountains to the west . He was sitting with us on the upper balcony at Khvicha 's house in the drifting fog at twilight ; from below came the sound of Khvicha hacking at our sheep . Giorgi , like many Khevsur males , had been made a " slave " of God in a boyhood ceremony when the sign of the cross was marked on his forehead with the blood of a freshly sacrificed bull . If the khati were to order him to do something , he would thereafter always be obliged to do it . " In my memory a man built his house in the territory of the khan , and his son lost his right hand , " Giorgi continued . " Everybody is sure it 's the khati who took his hand . Another time a man found a spring and made tubes to carry the water to the khati 's territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to the seer , who said the khati was angry , that if the khati had wanted the water he would have done it for himself . So now additional sacrifice would be required from the man and also from his descendants . If anybody cuts the trees or shoots a gun in the khati 's territory , same thing . No excuses . " The khati 's cult is a fantastic mixture of pagan and Christian elements , from the fact that each village spirit is given a saint 's name to the ceremonial readings from the Old and New Testaments . The people of the Caucasus have no difficulty reconciling these contradictions . " If you tell a Khevsur he 's a pagan , " Guram commented , " he 'll kill you . He sincerely believes he 's a Christian . " THE NEXT MORNING we left early for the festival , crossing and recrossing a racing icy river gray as liquid clay , past stony villages guarded by stonier towers . The sun welled up over the mountaintops and spilled over their peaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much wild grass as they could in the short summer . After almost three hours we reached the Tush village of Pharsma ; the sacrifices were well under way . The sacred area was atop a rise just behind the village , a wide green swath surrounding a dark stone building . Guram and Giorgi continued on without me to drink the proffered glass of sacred beer and join in the sacrificing . Being a woman , I was forbidden to come any closer than 150 feet , but I could see a long pole protruding from the stone wall that surrounded the building ; it was hung with brightly colored cloths , the khan 's banner , with a bell on the end . These pieces of new fabric recall the adornments that in past centuries were draped on the horns of sacrificial bulls . Within the confines of the sacred area , the sacrifice of sheep progressed . Each time an animal was presented , the priests shouted a short , chanting prayer- " May this man 's family be protected " - and then jangled the bell . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the spot . The shouting and the bell ringing went on past noon . It was going to be some feast . From where I stood , I could n't see the sacrifices , but I could see the assortment of bloody fleeces hanging on the stone wall . Not golden , like Jason 's fleece , but still clearly linked to the sacred . These would be the prizes for the riders in the afternoon 's horse race . A number of traditions linked to gold may have interlaced to form the myth of the golden fleece . The people of Georgia 's Svaneti region joined the cult of the sun with that of the ram in the sixth century B.c . Some 19th-century accounts describe local people laying fleeces in streams to capture bits of gold , a practice that may well date back to ancient times . As activities in the sacred area continued , I wandered through Pharsma and came upon other touchstones from Jason the Argonaut 's time : the honor in vendetta , the honor in sacrifice . I paused to talk with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd been born in the village , and he was willing to talk about his life . " When I was two or three , " he recalled , " my uncle was killed by some Kist , " a Muslim ethnic group scattered through the Caucasus . " My father killed 37 Kist in revenge . Not in one day but over the years . It was his personal obligation to kill them . He had promised to kill 40 , but he died , that 's why he did n't kill the last three . Then the Kist came and said I had to repay my father 's actions with 30 sheep and one house with all the furniture in it , but I said no . Since my grandmother was Kist , I had some supporters among them . Then time passed and everything became quiet . " We were leaning back against a low stone building under the scorching midday sun . Occasionally there was the distant chanting shout and bell ringing of another sacrifice ; twice a helicopter flew low and fast over the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border for guerrilla movements . A bright-eyed boy had been watching me curiously . I asked him his name . " Amirani , " he replied . In one of Georgia 's most famous myths , Amirani was the hero who challenged God and in punishment was chained to Mount Kazbek forever . When the Greeks , who could see the gleaming Caucasus summits from out at sea , heard this story , they amalgamated it with their own myth of Prometheus , moving him from his previously anonymous mountain peak to the Caucasus as well . " I have a heifer , " Amirani volunteered . " I call her Marta . The first calf she had was a bull , but we sold it . The firstborn always has to be sold or killed , you ca n't keep it . Firstfruits offerings have traditionally been the most sacred in many parts of the world , and all the families at today 's gathering had brought , if not a sheep , certainly a bottle of the first distillation of tchacha and specially baked bread . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best parts of each sheep , including the liver , had been dedicated to the khatias the ancient Greeks would have dedicated them to their gods . The meat , which the villagers only rarely indulge in , was boiling and roasting , and by midafternoon some 500 men , women , and children were sitting on the ground facing each other across long strips of oilcloth covered with dishes of meat , cucumbers and tomatoes , stewed eggplants , hot green peppers with wild herbs , and slabs of white cheese . The horse race began at six . We all crowded the cliff top overlooking the river , watching the eight small , sinewy stallions typical of the Caucasus thunder along the riverside , slowly stretching out in a line . Then they were clambering up the steep , slick , rocky path to the village . Gasping and blowing , the horses struggled up the last stretch , well strung out , some of them balking . Because Pharsma is inhabited only in the summer now , the feast day is a great annual homecoming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neighboring villagers eating and celebrating , passing along plastic pitchers of brown , opaque beer or dark , amber-colored wine . WINE IS THE SOUL OF GEORGIA , and the toast is the soul of the wine . Not for Georgians the random , inarticulate good humor of the glass in hand of most Westerners . The head of the table is the tamada , and he directs the sequence of toasts in a formal manner not unlike a priest : the first to God Almighty , then to the archangel Michael , St. George , and to ancestors . These invocations focus the mind and still the spirit , sanctifying even the simplest meal . My last evening before leaving Tusheti , I sat in a birch grove for a twilight picnic with Khvicha and Ia , his wife . Rostom and Maya , his brother and his sister , joined us . As we gnawed the last of our meat on skewers hot from the fire , Maya took out her little accordion and began to sing . Tush music is quivering music , like the birch leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , distant echoes , the silence . As the last light was gleaming from the peaks , Khvicha raised his glass . " To disappeared Tush , who died without descendants and whose houses have been taken over by plants , to their memory . " To all the young people who miss this village , who ca n't be here now . " To the past times that will never return to us . " To sisters and brothers . To Erla 's two sisters . To Ia 's sister . " For Guram , an only child : " To those who are to you as a brother and a sister . " Jason the Argonaut would have dedicated the wine and the words only to the gods ; here the phrases also included us . I came upon a toast of an altogether different sort at a funeral in the Georgian region of Svaneti west of Tusheti . A widow , no longer young but not yet old , sat swathed in black in the shade of the trees , wailing at the feet of her just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small table with a large glass jar full of pale wine and a few small glasses . When a mourner approached-always a man , I noticed-he would take the jar and fill a glass . But rather than drink , he would silently pour the wine in a short line onto the bare earth of the new grave . She had no more tears , but now the wine moistened and softened the soil . A kind of abyss stood between the silent villagers and the woman 's exhausted , hopeless lament . No consolations of Christianity here ; the local priest was absent . " We believe that on this day even God himself is mourning , " one man explained . But which god was accepting this libation ? For me , the question lingered . The most solemn toast of all I witnessed one evening in Svaneti at dinner . The tamada lifted his glass : " To Michael Khergiani , " he intoned , referring to the Svan alpinist " tiger of the rocks , " killed years ago in a fall . The men all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was time to drink , Guram tore off a piece of bread and delicately poured wine onto the bread . But he did n't eat it . He placed it on the edge of his plate , where it rested , soft and moist , like earth . " TO PEOPLE IN THE WESTERN PART OF TURKEY , everybody east of Samsun is Laz , " said Aydin Kudu , my interpreter . What this shows , apart from a little misinformation , is the fascination that the people of Turkey 's Black Sea region exert on their countrymen . Some 200,000 Laz embody the ancient link between Georgia and Turkey , when the area now divided by their common border was known as the Kingdom of Lazica , or later , under the Ottoman Empire , as Lazistan . The Laz are famous for being fiercely independent ( " Only a Laz woman can handle a Laz man , " they say ) , quick to laugh , especially at their own expense , addicted to hawking and to carrying pistols , and they often work in construction or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern region 's only distinctive people . Three smaller groups , the Hemsin , Rum , and Cepni , live in parallel ranges running close together near the coast , the soaring Kackar mountains and the Pontic Alps , named after Pontus Euxinos , Greek for Black Sea . While the Laz and Hemin spring from eastern roots in Georgia and Armenia , another group , called the Rum , is the sole remnant of the medieval west : Greek Byzantium . When Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 , most of the Greek Christians who remained in the Black Sea area gradually converted to Islam . The Rum are their descendants , and although they are Muslim Turks , their private , unwritten language , Rumca , is a form of Greek . The Black Sea people of Turkey share foggy , jungly mountains that have the highest rainfall in the country , a passion for dancing and music , and seemingly infinite self-sufficiency . ( In Turkey it 's enough to say you 're from the Black Sea for everyone to assume you 're a genius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastline , in some places plunging straight into the sea , leaving only strips and pockets of space for towns and roads . Villagers have always traveled back and forth between the shore and the peaks , and for centuries several important caravan routes through the mountain passes linked Trabzon to the luxurious cities of Persia and even India . Today the sea-now more distant culturally than physically from the mountain villages-still exerts a sort of tidal pull of possibility . The coast has always meant trade , travel , and prosperity . Despite shared geography , the Black Sea people maintain their differences . A well-worn joke tells of a homesick Laz in Germany , who , seeing a car bearing a Turkish license plate with the prefix 53 ( identifying the car as coming from Rize , the unofficial capital of the Lazy , kneels down to unscrew a tire 's air valve so he can breathe some hometown air . The Hemin are concentrated farther east , up in the mountains beyond Rize . Though traditional costume is becoming less common , many Hemsin women in the villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmy square anchored by a twisted and knotted strip of fabric . Cepni women , on the other hand , favor a colorful costume that entails bloomers , a pleated dress , and a piece of heavy woolen cloth tied firmly around the hips with cords ending in tassels . The Hemin are known throughout Turkey as pastry cooks , for the way they do n't roll their r 's when they speak , and for being ardent devotees of the boron -a line dance for both men and women that can go on for hours to the whine of the tulum , or bagpipe , along with the curious throaty cry the dancers spontaneously shout together . The Laz favor a small three  --  stringed violin called kemence , while the Rum often play a shepherd 's pipe called kaval . ALTHOUGH CUSTOMS OF THE BLACK SEA PEOPLE are visible everywhere in this tiny corner of Turkey , many more have dissolved in the vast sea known as modern life . Still here the people are determined to keep what they can . First on everyone 's list would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in the mountains . These also exist in Georgia , but to a lesser extent , and without inspiring the deep , atavistic hunger that the Turks feel for these empty , unspoiled spaces . Every spring for countless centuries families who have wintered in lowland settlements have herded their cows slowly up the rocky paths to these hamlets above the timberline . In the Kackar range , under black heights scarred with snow and glinting peaks gashed by knives of falling water , they spend the summer living in small huts they may have owned for generations , milking the cows and making cheese and butter for the winter . The cows wander at will , and the children run wild . Depending on the area and the people , the houses may be anything from small and stony to modest chalets of dark chestnut ; the terrain may be steep and rocky or sweeping meadow ; the cows may be fewer these days and may even arrive by truck rather than on the hoof . But for the families the experience is still the same : returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The expression " a house like a yayla " connotes almost everything good-horizons , space , peace . " If you put my husband in a five-star hotel in Ankara , " one Cepni woman told me , " he would n't be as happy as he is up here , with almost no water . " The earliest Black Sea peoples worshiped nature , and the people today still do . Aydin drove his Subaru SUV from a coastal town named Of up into the mountains , jostling over rocks and potholes , past wooden farmhouses and swatches of cornfields and the odd tobacco patch clinging to a steep , green hillside . It could have been a scene from deepest Kentucky , if not for the occasional minaret punctuating the lush forests and tea gardens , or the women scything the slanting fields of hay . We eventually reached a vast , airy moor dotted with houses that undulated toward the horizon , wherever that might have been in the soft folds of the fog . We reached the yayla of Sultan Murat , whose main street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of one , and Huseyin came out . Small and compact , with blunt , hard hands and short , light brown hair , Huseyin is a Rum . He has a square , lined face , brilliant eyes , and a taut energy that strains at the reins of good manners . Huseyin remembered Aydin from an earlier visit , and before long we were down the path and sitting inside his house with his family and their friends , drinking tea . He and Aydin lounged on a broad mattress on the floor of the small living room , while I squeezed onto the only bench with two of his daughters , Elif and Tugba . Ayse , his ample , red-cheeked wife , sat on the floor cross-legged , leaning against the wall facing us . " I like the way of life here , " Huseyin was saying . In the winter the family live near Caykara , the town halfway down the mountains , but they always bring their two cows here for the summer . " In town you lose all your energy-here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleaning and milking cows do n't make you tired if you have peace of mind , " she said , " and here we have a lot . " Filmy fog floated in through the open door across her face , mingling with the gray smoke from the fire in the small iron stove in the corner . One Turkish writer nostalgically recalled the yayla smell : Fog , wood smoke , cow dung . In fact , it was time to bring in the cows . They both followed Ayse placidly into the stalls under the room where we 'd been sitting . I sat with her while she milked them , breathing in the hay smell , slightly mesmerized by the wind chime tones of the bells around their necks . It did seem more than a little idyllic here , but of course I did n't have to lug the heavy can of fresh milk upstairs or do anything with it afterward . Talk about doing something the traditional way , and you 're talking about somebody who is sweating . The Black Sea Turks acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just that more people are using concrete rather than wood for their houses . More family members are living in cities , so there are fewer cows to tend and less time available to spend with them in the mountains during the summer . Members of the younger generation have more money than their parents did , so they go to the Aegean beaches or even abroad for vacation instead of going to the yayla . " I want my computer , I want my TV , I want my friends , " said Yigit , a young Hemsin man in the yayla of Kavron . " There are n't many people my age here . They 're old people or little children . " Even the older generation sees that change is inevitable . " It used to be all you needed to buy was kerosene and sometimes tea and white flour during Ramadan , " said efik , a Cepni father . " I can live like that , but not my children . What once determined if a man was rich was if he had enough corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is rich is a flat in the city , a good salary , a car . " Perhaps it is the very youngest who will turn out to keep the yayla tradition alive . Gizem , Sefik 's nine-year-old cousin , told me the yayla made her feel free . " In Istanbul , when we want to go somewhere , my mother does n't let me go alone . There are cars , traffic . Here I can go everywhere when I want . " " I just like it here . It 's entertaining , time goes fast , " said Pakize , a 14  --  year-old Hemsin girl . Jason coasted the Black Sea 's rocky shoreline , where vacationing families now float in big inner tubes , becalmed argonauts fighting the heat . The mountains and forests for him were full of danger , known only by their terrifying tribes and their even more implacable gods , of whom today 's khati is a relatively benign survivor . What is the bond that links the Black Sea people of Georgia and Turkey to their past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The primitive belief in the forces of nature , " mused Shota Chartolani , an archaeologist I 'd met in the mountains of Svaneti . " I think this was the main force that helped these tribes to survive . " The forces of nature are still the source of their strength . I had seen it in the easy rhythm of summer days high in the mountain meadows , in the boys riding the stallions bareback up and down the rocky slopes . I had felt it in the ecstatic music of a black-haired Laz man playing his kemence in a dripping , darkening forest ; in the propitiations of blood or wine that mark every important passage from the building of a boat in Turkey to the departure of a guest in Georgia ; in the way the Hemin dance the boron for pulsing , hypnotic hours , perhaps no longer remembering that its slow-moving circle connects them to the frenzied bacchic dances of earliest Greece . The people of the Black Sea have indeed survived by honoring the forces of nature . But do they even think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have no need to . They belong to them .
