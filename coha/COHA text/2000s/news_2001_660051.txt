<p> Satire that still sparks after 225 years , Harold Pinter plays old and new , and a brisk Stephen Sondheim revival are among the shows lighting up the London theater scene during these dark winter nights . But daytime in London is far from dull , too : The city 's museums boast massive Oscar Wilde , William Blake , and J.M.W. Turner exhibitions . The Royal Shakespeare Company gives The Rivals rapid , precise pacing and enunciation . Richard Brinsley Sheridan 's 18th-century spoof of social pretension and high-minded money grubbing is a triumph of ensemble acting . Benjamin Whitrow , best known in the US from the 1995 BBC/PBS television version of " Pride and Prejudice , " delivers proper bombast as Sir Anthony Absolute , who insists his wayward son marry the girl he dictates - even if the young man adores her . Emily Raymond swoons appropriately as Lydia Languish , spicing up romance by writing anonymous notes to herself and lamenting her inability to abandon riches for poverty . Robert Portal , seen in the film " Mrs. Dalloway , " bumbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shines as Mrs. Malaprop , the interfering aunt impaled on her own wordiness . Ms. Craig 's hauteur as she mystifies other characters while delighting audiences would - as Mrs. M. might put it - be a travesty to miss . Americans who do , however , can still see her in the RSC 's continuing Shakespearian cycle of " Henry VI " Parts One , Two and Three , and " Richard III " at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , March 10-18 . Forty years ago , London and Broadway audiences were captivated by Pinter 's The Caretaker . Donald Pleasence , as the tramp constantly planning to get his identity papers , and Alan Bates , as his sardonic , tough brother who teases him , memorably created the lead roles that vivified the elliptic tragi-comedy about three dreamers trapped in a junk-filled room . In this crisp revival , Michael Gambon ( in the film " The Insider " and TV 's " Inspector Maigret " and " The Singing Detective " ) blusters where Sir Donald whined . He makes snarling , not sniveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another in a dance of illusion and noncommunication . Rupert Graves , whose film appearances include " A Room with a View " and " A Handful of Dust , " could have been more menacing in the malevolent Bates part , but co-star Douglas Hodge mesmerizes as he delivers a monologue about a botched medical procedure that has numbed his emotions . In 1972 , 13 years after he had written " The Caretaker , " Pinter attempted to adapt Marcel Proust 's epic Remembrance of Things Past into a screenplay . The playwright has called that year his most creative ever , even though financial problems prevented production of the film . The script was shelved . Then , 20 years later , director Di Trevis came across his treatment , the upshot of which is a collaboration with Pinter now playing at the Royal National Theatre . It 's a riveting pastiche of Proustian dreams and decadence . This challenging and compelling three-hour production provides a satisfying taste of Proust 's 3,000-page tome . Directed with choreographic sweep by Ms. Trevis , the stage is dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Swann , and Indira Varma , as the el Albertine who adores and deceives him . Rounding out the cast are British repertory veterans Jill Johnson , Julie Legrand , John Burgess , and John Bett , all of whom excel in multiple roles as aristocrats , wastrels , and social climbers . ( The National should , as does Benet 's Reader 's Encyclopedia , provide a ' who 's who ' chart of the dozens of characters . Keeping track of them all is also easier after viewing Paul Ruiz 's beautiful 1999 film , " Time Regained , " starring John Malkovich and Catherine Deneuve . ) Experience filtered through memory also forms the motif of Madame Melville , Richard Nelson 's slightly flawed but rewarding study of a 15-year-old American student who is seduced by his charismatic , neurotic French teacher . Irene Jacob , a magnetic film presence in " The Double Life of Veronique " and " Red , " fascinates as the cultured but desperate older woman . Macaulay Culkin is merely adequate as the smitten sophomore . Although the star of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin stage presence underscores Nelson 's failure to let the audience know how the seduction affects the boy 's adult life . Culkin 's own callowness makes us wonder why a woman so sophisticated - no matter how lonely - could be attracted to him . Madeleine Potter , a Broadway and Off-Broadway veteran soon to be seen in the Merchant-Ivory film of " The Golden Bowl , " excels in the complex role of the teacher 's friend . Both women are deftly characterized as too brilliant for their own happiness ; their literary , artistic , and musical talents simply frustrate them as they plod through routine jobs . Stephen Sondheim 's Merrily We Roll Along lasted only two weeks on Broadway 20 years ago . Now , one of London 's most innovative theater companies , Donmar Warehouse , gives it a spirited revival in an intimate setting . Ten years earlier , in " Follies , " Sondheim effectively took characters back in time to underscore how years can tarnish ideals . Here , the once-starving , now cynical artists are too one-dimensional to arouse much interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls amusingly along in revue fashion . The songs " Old Friends " and " Not a Day Goes By " are - in the mercenary producer character 's own words - " hummable . " " Bobby , Jackie and Jack " is a sprightly spoof of 1960s Kennedymania . And a perky young cast headed by Julian Ovenden as the increasingly crass composer , Daniel Evans as his clear-headed lyricist , and Shona White as their waspish writer friend , romp through the piece . All this energy , and the chance to see how Sondheim has developed , make " Merrily " eminently watchable . As last year 's Off-Broadway production of his first and never previously staged show " Saturday Night " proved , anything by Sondheim , the contemporary musical theater 's most gifted and innovative composer , is well worth seeing . * * * Special offerings 1at London 's museums include a rich British Library exhibit on Oscar Wilde . It encompasses everything from the 8-year-old aesthete 's critique of a blue shirt to the notorious challenge that triggered the comic genius 's sordid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his devoted , long-suffering wife . Recordings of his son 's reminiscences and excerpts from the splendid production of " The Importance of Being Earnest " starring John Gielgud and Edith Evans round out the display . The biggest event ever at the Tate Britain - a 500-work exhibit on the literary and artistic revolutionary William Blake - is the largest yet mounted to honor the man who blended art and poetry with new engraving techniques . It underscores Blake 's steadfastness in an age of repression , his links with radicals such as Thomas Paine , and his fascination with post-revolutionary America and France . " The Tyger " manuscript , Blake 's " re-composition " of Dante 's " Inferno , " and 100 plates of the long poem " Jerusalem " highlight this exhaustive show . The protean J.M.W. Turner - whom some consider Britain 's greatest landscape painter - is honored by a Royal Academy display of 100 of his watercolors . Many of these were intended for exhibition or as the basis for engravings ; they range through a 60-year career launched when he exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the 1804 " Fall of the Reichenbach " prove Turner 's claim that he could make watercolors as rich in tones as oils . It is also worth braving the crowds to see the British Museum 's much-heralded renovations . The famous round Reading Room , used by everyone from Charles Dickens to Virginia Woolf , has reopened , while the Great Court , Europe 's largest covered plaza , features a spectacular soaring roof . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
