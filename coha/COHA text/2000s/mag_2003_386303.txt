Graham 's career in the mainline <p> BILLY GRAHAM and I hit New York City at the same time , the summer of 1957 . He was 38 and about to clinch his reputation as the premier evangelist in Protestant history . I was 12 and about to taste freedom . But not yet . Night after night my parents packed themselves and me into a steamy subway to go down to Madison Square Garden to hear the Great Man preach . Soon our first family vacation to the Northeast was over , and we headed back to the bucolic quiet of southwest Missouri . I could n't figure out what the big whoop on Graham was all about . <p> If the Graham sensation left at least one adolescent bemused , it left the men and women in the tall steeple churches of the Protestant mainline divided . Many deplored the evangelist 's success , but many others  --  perhaps a majority  --  cautiously welcomed it . It is the second group , the cautious welcomers , that chiefly attracts our attention . Figuring out why Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex structure and the persisting strength of the mainline in modern America . <p> But first the deplorers . Though the critics on Graham 's theological left represented diverse voices  --  serious theologians , denominational leaders , academic elites and practiced journalists , among others  --  they sounded similar notes of dismay . As far back as 1952 the British Council of Churches , which spoke for the majority of British Christians , refused to join the British Evangelical Alliance 's invitation to Graham to speak in London . When he arrived two years later , one newspaper judged that he displayed " all the tricks of the modern demagogue . " <p> In 1956 , during a trip to India , Graham suggested that the U.S. government might give Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru a " white air-conditioned Cadillac . " That recommendation prompted the CHRISTIAN CENTURY to conclude that Graham " has n't a glimmer of a notion about what is really going on in the world . " A Filipino paper likened him to a religious Liberace trying " to sell American friendship to India in the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Graham visited Yale in February 1957 , the Yale Daily News judged him " embarrassingly overdramatic " and " clearly underintellectualized . " His insights , it said , were " banal " and his message irrelevant to the Yale undergraduate . <p> By then Graham was getting used to being snubbed by theologians and intellectuals , or at least he should have been . Reinhold Niebuhr 's biographer Richard Wrightman Fox tells us that Niebuhr was " angry " when the New York City Protestant Council of Churches invited Graham to hold crusade meetings in the summer of 1957 . Writing in March of that year , Niebuhr acknowledged that Graham was a " personable , modest and appealing young man , " but he dreaded Graham 's " rather obscurantist version of the Christian faith . " The crusade opened May 15 . After watching the preacher 's performance on the job for a month , Niebuhr remained unmoved . Mass evangelism 's success , he grumped in the July 1 issue of Life , " depends upon oversimplifying every issue , " but Graham 's version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before provided . " Niebuhr concluded that Graham 's bland message " promises a new life , not through painful religious experience but merely by signing a decision card . Thus , a miracle of regeneration is promised at a painless price by an obviously sincere evangelist . It is a bargain . " When Graham tried to meet with Niebuhr to talk things over , Niebuhr refused . " Graham Ballyhoo Cheapens Ministry , Niebuhr Says , " was how a New York Post headline summed up the professor 's view of the preacher . <p> Others followed Niebuhr 's astringent path . Writing in 1959 , William G. McLoughlin , Graham 's first scholarly biographer , tried to be fair . Even so , McLoughlin found that as a " rallying center for many persons in a state of confusion , he was a typical revival figure . " McLoughlin allowed that " Graham 's decline might be gradual ... or it might be precipitous . " Either way , professional evangelists like Finney , Moody , Jones , Sunday and Graham were " not likely to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand long as a symbol of it . " <p> Graham failed to slip out the back door as predicted , and doubts about his theological timbre persisted . In 1973 he preached to a half million people in one service in Seoul , South Korea  --  reportedly the largest religious gathering in history ( a figure later eclipsed by John Paul II and doubled by Graham himself ) . Still , some pastors criticized him because , as he put it , " I did not have enough theological content to my messages . " <p> The evangelist 's perennially cozy relationship with the rich and the powerful did not help matters . In the 1970s his very visible friendship with President Richard Nixon , coupled with his ill-disguised support for Nixon 's political aspirations , probably marked the nadir of his reputation in the mainline seminaries , old-line universities and establishment press . In 1990 the Catholic polymath Garry Wills charged that politicians had " somewhat cynically " manipulated Graham . That Graham was the kind of lightweight who allowed himself to be manipulated seemed plausible ; elsewhere Wills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the 1950s . <p> So IT WENT , year after year . In the late 1990s Graham 's flowing white hair still did not protect him from withering critique , especially from academics and intellectuals . When his 760-page autobiography , Just as I Am , came out in 1997 , Columbia University 's Andrew Delbanco acknowledged that Graham  --  the " Elvis of the evangelicals "  --  seemed sincere , " winsome " and " genuinely enlarged by his travels . " But Delbanco found the book " monotonous " and short on insight . Its humor was mostly " unwitting " and its writing never rose above " genial banality . " The book was , in short , " little more than just another celebrity autobiography  --  the fluff one expects from most politicians , newscasters and movie stars . " <p> And then there was 9/11 . In Graham 's memorial talk at the National Cathedral on 9/14 , he sought to comfort the grieving by saying that many of the victims were now in heaven and would not want to come back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged . Leon Wieseltier , literary editor of the New Republic , pounced . " We should not have to choose between being imbeciles and being mourners , " said Wieseltier . " But mourners can be imbeciles , too . " He offered Graham 's remark as Exhibit A. " It is not consoling , it is insulting . We are not a country of children . Nothing that transpired on September 11 was wonderful , nothing . " <p> Such sour reactions to Graham should not surprise us . After all , for many years he came across as a North Carolina farm boy distinguished by little more than hand-painted ties , a southern accent and a degree from the ( then ) fundamentalist Wheaton College  --  not propitious credentials in midtown Manhattan . On the key doctrinal points that divided mainliners from evangelicals  --  miracles , atonement , resurrection , Second Coming , holy living and biblical infallibility  --  Graham budged hardly an inch in 50 years . Worst of all was the style . To many he personified the proverbial stump orator , always holding forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National and the World Council(s) of Churches consistently favored dialogue over proclamation , Graham unflinchingly presented his own interpretation of the Good News as the most viable one . <p> But confrontation between Graham and the mainline forms only half the story  --  indeed , maybe less than half . If some theologians and leaders in the historic seminaries and churches uttered criticism , many others expressed praise . That pattern too went way back , in this case to Graham 's 1949 tent revival in Los Angeles . In an event that has acquired a mythic career of its own , the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst instructed his Los Angeles papers to " Puff Graham . " Hearst , who was not notably religious , likely had his own motives , but his directive gave the unsophisticated young preacher a badly needed stamp of legitimization at a time when tent revivalists and Pentecostal faith healers seemed all the same . <p> By the middle 1950s Graham had established a clear policy : he would work with anyone who would work with him if they attached no strings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals such as New York 's Presbyterian pastor John Sutherland Bonnell to step onto the platform , many of his fundamentalist supporters stepped off  --  and stayed off . But Graham held firm . After 1950 he declared he would not accept any invitation unless a majority of a city 's Protestant ministers gave at least tacit support . The calls to speak in mainline seminaries and on secular campuses probably did not rain down as abundantly as requests to address the multitudes in urban coliseums , but they came . The record includes talks at Harvard , Yale , Dartmouth , MIT , Boston College , Chapel Hill , Union Theological Seminary and Colgate Rochester Divinity School , among others . <p> The record also includes support from impeccably respectable Protestant leaders like Henry Pitney Van Dusen , president of Union Theological Seminary in the 1950s and 1960s when Union stood astride the mainline as no other school did . Regarding Graham , Van Dusen distanced himself from his older colleague Niebuhr . What " the masses need first , " he wrote , " is the pure milk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dusen added that " there are many , of whom I am one , who ... would probably never have come within the sound of Dr. Niebuhr 's voice ... if they had not been first touched by the message of the earlier Billy . " Van Dusen meant of course Billy Sunday . <p> Graham 's autobiography affords additional insight into his legacy in the mainline . If the book reads like People magazine , stuffed with tales of friendships with top politicos , movie stars , business tycoons and sports celebrities , it also contains numerous stories of friendships with respected theologians , critics , pastors and religious leaders . The list includs Emil Brunner , Karl and Markus Barth , Martin Luther King Jr. , Sidney Rittenberg , Norman Vincent Peale , Archbishop Michael Ramsey , Bishop K. H. Ting , Bishop Fulton J. Sheen , Pope John Paul II and Rabbi Marc Tannenbaum . That window opened only one way , of course ; Graham , like everyone else , saw what he wanted to see . But as far as I know , no one asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews of the volume in secular and in mainline organs were telling too . Though some were cheerier than others , the civility of the response to what , by any reasonable measure of things , must be regarded as a very long , very sunny and very nondisclosing book invites explanation . " You do n't run for office , " quipped Yale 's literary critic Harold Bloom , " by deprecating Billy Graham . " While no reviewer intimated that Graham 's reputation rested on scholarly accomplishments , more than one acknowledged that intelligence could take multiple forms . What radiated from the pages , they suggested , was a kind of theological street smarts that showed a shrewd grasp of human nature and sensitivity to the temper of the times . <p> GRAHAM 'S PERENNIAL ability to win the admiration of the broad middle band of the American people stands as another measure of his legacy in the mainline . Obviously Center Street U.S.A. is not the same as Tall Steeple Square U.S.A. We can not automatically assume that Gallup poll data on what the average person thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nonetheless , a variety of indicators suggests that the overlap is substantial . Journalists ' accounts of Graham 's crusades recurrently have noted the number of attendees from mainline churches and the high level of cooperation from mainline pastors . Crusade counselors are instructed to return the favor by sending " inquirers " back to mainline churches when requested . Most important , perhaps , when the letters to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association perennially tally in the hundreds of thousands , and the listeners and viewers of his radio and television programs perennially number in the millions , common sense suggests that evangelicals and Pentecostals can not be the only ones supporting him . <p> However parsed , the statistics and awards pile up like snowdrifts . By one scholar 's tabulation , Graham has addressed 80 million hearers in person and another 130 million through the media ( the majority presumably being Americans ) . HarperCollins 's first printing of Graham 's autobiography ran a cool million . The U.S. government has given him the two highest awards a civilian can receive : the Presidential Medal of Freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Just rehearsing the list of " firsts " and " largests ' would fill an essay in itself . For present purposes two illustrations provided by Graham 's biographer William Martin suffice . First , between 1950 and 1990 Graham won a spot on the Gallup Organization 's " Most Admired " list more often than any other American . Indeed , in 1970 he even made the " Best Dressed " list  --  a revealing factoid in itself , for the preacher is no fashion plate . The second anecdote comes from the postal service . In all likelihood Graham is , along with whoever happens to be president , the only person in the United States who needs no address beyond his name . Just " Billy Graham ( World Citizen ) c/o American Government " will do ( or at least has done ) . <p> So why so much acceptance in the mainline ? Thoughtful observers have offered a variety of reasons . Graham 's sincerity , honesty , civility , planning , media savvy and sexual and financial integrity rank high on most lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he represents Americans ' " best selves , " what they want to believe about their dedication to " fundamental verities . " Americans also admire his willingness to apologize for his mistakes . These include his onetime inclination " to identify the gospel with any one political program or culture , " as he himself admitted after the Nixon debacle . More troubling were Graham 's aspersions about Jews ' " stranglehold " on the media , privately uttered in Nixon 's office in 1972 and brought to light in 2002 . Though the context of the conversation remains disputed , Graham 's own unqualified repudiation of his words seemed to blunt the anger , if not the disappointment , many felt . <p> THOUGH ALL OF these explanations for Graham 's influence in the uptown churches hold merit , I see three additional factors especially worth noting . The first is that the mainline is not monolithically liberal . Many local congregations are evangelical from top to bottom , and many others present a mixed package of evangelical theology , connectional polity and high-church liturgy . Graham once remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1956 he helped found Christianity Today , partly to provide a voice for evangelicals in the mainline who did not find themselves represented in the CHRISTIAN CENTURY . <p> That theological commonality reflects a deeper one . The latter might be described as a determination to take seriously things that matter . In , New Wine in Old Wineskins , the sociologist R. Stephen Warner deftly describes a moribund historic congregation experiencing rejuvenation from within . Charismatic moments occur , to be sure . But in the end , the lightning-in-the-night experience delivers less than a clear-eyed resolve to live a Christian life . The mainline knows this , and so does Graham . His own tearless decision for Christ in a Mordecai Ham revival in Charlotte in 1935 set the pattern . Significantly , he called his magazine Decision  --  not Insight or Suddenly from Heaven or Heart Strangely Warmed . Equally significant , the thousands who stream forward in the crusade meetings are dubbed " inquirers , " not " converts . " Counselors direct them to permanent homes of worship , preferably evangelical , but often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . Both Graham and the mainline know that the nurturing of faith takes time and care . Kissing might kindle a marriage , but cooking keeps it going . <p> A second factor that explains Graham 's roomy share of the mainline market in the last quarter century is his reconstructed relation to national politics . In this respect Graham himself seems to have come to Jesus  --  not the Jesus of the hard liberationist left , but the Jesus of the soft compassionate left . In many ways the mature Graham has embraced the warmhearted liberalism represented by Mark Hatfield , Jimmy Carter , Marion Wright Edelman and the younger Martin Luther King Jr . If the fiery youthful Graham worried about lawlessness at home and communism abroad , the reflective older Graham has worried more about loneliness at home and AIDS abroad . His increasingly progressive record on civil rights and nuclear proliferation , two of the most momentous challenges of the late 20th century , has placed him in the moderate forefront of American Christians ' social conscience . He has avoided unseemly entanglements with the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Islam . <p> This is not to say that the seasoned Graham does not desire a more Christian America , or that he doubts the necessity of Christ for humans ' salvation . But it is to say that an enriched store of experiences  --  much of it purchased the hard way in a punishing schedule of evangelistic meetings abroad  --  has brought with it a deepened awareness of life 's complexities . <p> AND FINALLY there is the clarity of Graham 's message . A steady focus on the essentials  --  which for Graham might be summarized as the assurance that God has taken care of the brokenness of our past , so the future is up to us  --  has marked his ministry from the beginning . Over the years two or three theologians outside Graham 's own evangelical tradition , and possibly one or two within , have suggested that things might be , well , a bit more complicated than that . And clearly Graham himself , like most preachers , believes more than he says from the pulpit . But in the approaching darkness ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is , he insists , no time to trifle with subtleties or fuss about matters in dispute . <p> The aim is as simple as it is profound : keep the big picture in view . Corny jokes , mispronounced words and butchered facts have harmed Graham 's reputation just about as much as they harmed Ronald Reagan 's or Lyndon Johnson 's before him  --  which is to say , except in Cambridge , Madison and Berkeley , hardly any at all . Like most truly charismatic leaders , they all knew the power of a single , luminous vision that could organize the whole of experience , be it patriotic , legislative or spiritual . And they all felt , in words Paul Varg applied to 19th-century China missionaries , " the lure of playing life 's role on the world stage . " Both Graham and the mainline sometimes failed themselves by getting lost in the thickets of sectarian controversy . But on the whole both kept their gaze firmly fixed on the amplitude , not the parsimony , of God 's involvement in history . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no exemptions . I have not seen him in person since that memorable summer 45 years back , but adroitly edited television specials suggest that the stabbing gestures and electrifying delivery have slowed to folksy conversations with appreciative audiences . The voice falters , the hands shake with Parkinson 's disease , and the angular body now sometimes speaks from a wheelchair . " I am a man who is still in process , " he told a biographer not long ago . And so he is . This month Graham rounds out his 85th year . Though there is talk of another crusade in London in May 2004 , apparently he spends most of his time these days at home , high in the Great Smoky Mountains near Montreat , North Carolina . One senses that Graham 's era is soon to pass , and no one , including son Franklin , will replace him . <p> In the end , assessing Graham 's legacy for his own evangelical subculture may be less important than assessing his legacy for the mainline . Despite all the talk about a new evangelical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new plural America dominated by secularists , Jews and Muslims , the plain truth is that the old Protestant establishment still exerts enormous influence on the culture-shaping agencies of our society . Discerning Graham 's role in that process will require a discriminating touch . Neither debunking nor romanticizing him will take us very far . What is needed , rather , is a careful effort to see how an array of historically specific personal ingredients  --  talent , ambition , charisma , stamina and integrity  --  combined with an array of historically specific social ingredients  --  militarization , suburbanization , internationalization and diversification  --  to create a man and a legacy of exceptional proportions . That said , the hardest challenge might be to remember that the man and the mountain were not the same . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Grant Wacker <p> <p> Grant Wacker , author of Heaven Below : Early Pentecostals and American Culture , teaches at Duke Divinity School . <p>                   @ @
