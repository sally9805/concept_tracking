As details poured out about the illegal and unseemly activities of Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff , White House officials sought to portray the scandal as a Capitol Hill affair with little relevance to them . Peppered for days with questions about Abramoff 's visits to the White House , press secretary Scott McClellan said the now disgraced lobbyist had attended two huge holiday receptions and a few " staff-level meetings " that were not worth describing further . " The President does not know him , nor does the President recall ever meeting him , " McClellan said . <P> The President 's memory may soon be unhappily refreshed . TIME has seen five photographs of Abramoff and the President that suggest a level of contact between them that Bush 's aides have downplayed . While TIME 's source refused to provide the pictures for publication , they are likely to see the light of day eventually because celebrity tabloids are on the prowl for them . And that has been a fear of the Bush team 's for the past several months : that a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of direct presidential involvement in a burgeoning corruption scandal like the shots of President Bill Clinton at White House coffees for campaign contributors in the mid-1990s . <P> In one shot that TIME saw , Bush appears with Abramoff , several unidentified people and Raul Garza Sr. , a Texan Abramoff represented who was then chairman of the Kickapoo Indians , which owned a casino in southern Texas . Garza , who is wearing jeans and a bolo tie in the picture , told TIME that Bush greeted him as " Jefe , " or " chief " in Spanish . Another photo shows Bush shaking hands with Abramoff in front of a window and a blue drape . The shot bears Bush 's signature , perhaps made by a machine . Three other photos are of Bush , Abramoff and , in each view , one of the lobbyist 's sons ( three of his five children are boys ) . A sixth picture shows several Abramoff children with Bush and House Speaker Dennis Hastert , who is now pushing to tighten lobbying laws after declining to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Most of the pictures have the formal look of photos taken at presidential receptions . The images of Bush , Abramoff and one of his sons appear to be the rapid-fire shots  --  known in White House parlance as clicks  --  that the President snaps with top supporters before taking the podium at fund-raising receptions . Over five years , Bush has posed for tens of thousands of such shots  --  many with people he does not know . Last month 9,500 people attended holiday receptions at the White House , and most went two by two through a line for a photo with the President and the First Lady . The White House is generous about providing copies  --  in some cases , signed by the President  --  that become centerpieces for " walls of fame " throughout status-conscious Washington .
