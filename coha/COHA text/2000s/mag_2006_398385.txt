<p> TEN PERCENT OF A TWO-YEAR-OLD 'S NOUNS are brand names ; by the time an American child heads to school , he or she can recognize hundreds of logos . Disney is now putting its cartoon characters on fresh fruit , arguing ( perhaps correctly ) that it 's the only way to get kids to eat it . If that 's the world we 're born into , is it any wonder we want corporations to solve our biggest problems as well ? Is n't it a parent 's job to protect us ? And besides , who else has the capital and the power to do what needs to be done in the Face of a crisis like global warming ? <p> Any sign that corporations might be willing to take on the job is greeted with an enthusiasm that borders on delusion . When John Browne , the head of British Petroleum , gave a speech in 1997 admitting that global warming exists , and announcing that business must respond " to the reality and the concerns of the world in which you operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The head of California 's Environmental Protection Agency ventured that " this bold move will set the world stage for other companies to emulate . " BP commissioned green roofs for its filling stations , along with a whole slew of ads touting its vision for a world " beyond petroleum , " And there is every reason to think Lord Browne was sincere - he 'd studied the problem , knew it was big , and was willing to buck the rest of the industry in saying so . <p> Browne was not the only executive thinking aloud about how corporations relate to the rest of the world . His comments came as the debate over " corporate social responsibility , " long a preoccupation for people in fuzzy sweaters , was about to explode into mainstream business culture . The movement has now spawned a booming industry in consultants and conferences ; just this summer the World Business Council on Sustainable Development issued a manifesto titled " From Challenge to Opportunity , " filled with pictures of baking deserts and disease-stricken peasants , but also with promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the society we serve . " BP signed on , and so did everyone from Adidas to Procter &; Gamble . <p> Which is nice . The question is , what does it amount to ? <p> Take BP . In 2004 , its revenues from solar power were almost $400 million ; its total revenues , almost entirely from hydrocarbons , were $285 billion . In other words , the company has gone beyond petroleum to the tune of about one-sixth of 1 percent of sales ( see " It 's Not Easy Being Green , " opposite page ) . And the news gets worse from there . The leak disaster that led to this summer 's sudden shutdown of BP 's Alaska pipeline turns out not to have been sudden at all . Back in 1992 , when a whistleblower raised concerns about corrosion in the pipeline , BP responded with a corporate crackdown that a federal judge said was " reminiscent of Nazi Germany . " Elsewhere , the Wall Street Journal reports that federal regulators are investigating whether BP tried to influence crude-oil prices using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate probe , investigators are trying to figure out if BP gamed gasoline prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange . Meanwhile , the company 's top American executive was co-chairman of the Bush reelection campaign in Alaska . Not very far beyond petroleum , that . <p> THERE IS NO QUESTION that entrepreneurs with a social bent can do enormous good - especially until they decide to go public or sell out to a larger corporation . And they can do well at the same time , connecting with a reasonably large block of motivated consumers . If I need paper towels , they 're damn well going to come from Seventh Generation . I would probably wear Patagonia jackets even if they were n't so incredibly warm . <p> But these tend to be one-off deals . Ben and Jerry did n't seem to change the way Hagen and Dazs viewed the world . Somehow , Bounty has been willing to leave the thoughtful paper towel market to Seventh Generation . For several decades now , environmentalists have been citing the work of Ray Anderson and Interface ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's a great example - but why is there still only one Ray Anderson ? <p> Often the difficulty is built right into a company 's business model . It makes scant difference whether Wal-Mart starts stocking organic food or not , because the real problem is the imperative to ship products all over the world , sell them in vast , downtown-destroying complexes , and push prices so low that neither workers nor responsible suppliers can prosper . ( In fact , Wal-Mart 's decision to sell organic food will almost certainly mean the final consolidation of the industry into the hands of a few huge growers that ship their produce across thousands of miles - not to mention that the people ringing up the organic groceries will still make below-poverty wages and taxpayers will still be footing the bill for their health care . There 's something gross about buying a healthy carrot from a sick company . ) <p> By the same token , though , business models can propel companies forward even if the CEOs could n't care less about the planet : Dow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent this decade , simply because their managers started to pay attention to energy costs and figured out that efficiency went straight to the bottom line . <p> " Will business save the world ? " turns out to be the wrong question . The right question is " How can we structure the world so that businesses play their part in saving it ? " And the answer to that , inevitably , is politics . <p> Some of it is the politics of public awareness . It 's no accident that Vermont and Oregon are hotbeds of do-good capitalism ; in these places attitudes have shifted so that conscience pays . Many of us have worked like crazy to get people excited about , say , hybrid cars - and , aided by rising oil prices , the propaganda has begun to succeed . <p> But mostly we need politics of a more straightforward , and entirely unglamorous , variety . If you want energy companies to rearrange their portfolios so that way more money goes to renewables and way less to hydrocarbons , the best way forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's to pass laws to push him in the right direction . This is what has happened in Europe , where regulators told car manufacturers last August to cut vehicles ' greenhouse emissions by 25 percent - or else ( see also " The Muscles From Brussels , " Page 62 ) . The car industry should be aware that we are watching the situation very closely , " one official told reporters , adding that the EU " will not hesitate to replace the carrot with the stick . " There 's nothing particularly European about that logic - witness the efforts in the United States of a few bold state attorneys general , who in the face of federal inaction have begun to sue major carbon emitters on their own . They may not win - but the threat of liability has already gotten big polluters to talk about offering voluntary carbon cuts in exchange for legal immunity . In an August report , the investor activist group Ceres quoted a Goldman Sachs analysis that put possible global warming liability on the same scale as the fallout from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attention in a hurry . <p> Helping corporations do the right thing through regulation - which , it should be noted , also levels the playing field so that a greenish BP does n't have to worry about a dirty ExxonMobil - is not exactly a new idea . It 's more or less what we used to do , in the long period from Teddy Roosevelt and the trustbusters on to about the 1980s . <p> One reason for the shift is the enormous political power of corporations , which they use almost exclusively to boost their own profits . But in a way , you ca n't blame them for that . The strange part is how little opposition the corporate agenda meets anymore - how many of us have accepted the ideological argument that as long as we leave commerce alone , it will somehow , magically , solve all our problems . We could compel Big Oil to take its windfall profits and build windmills ; instead we stand quietly by , as if unfettered plunder were the obvious and necessary course . <p> Explaining this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the childlike enchantment we 've lived under since the Reagan era , we 've wanted very much to believe that someone else , some wavy-haired CEO , would do the hard , adult work of problem-solving . In fact , corporations are the infants of our society - they know very little except how to grow ( though they 're very good at that ) , and they howl when you set limits . Socializing them is the work of politics . It 's about time we took it up again . <p> By Bill McKibben <p>
