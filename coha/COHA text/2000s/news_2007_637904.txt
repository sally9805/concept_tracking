Paper Walls finds the band getting back to speed  --  literally . If the guys in Yellowcard did n't write such insistently poppy melodies , they 'd sound like a thrash band , and the breakneck tempos do n't let up until halfway through the album . Lyrically , Yellowcard has matured since 2003 teen anthem Ocean Avenue , but there 's still an appealing sweetness here . Part of it comes from Sean Mackin 's violin , an anomaly in the pop-punk world , but it 's most apparent in Dear Bobbie , which features Key 's grandfather reading a love letter to his wife of 58 years .  --  Brian Mansfield <p> &gt;&gt;Download : Shadows and Regrets , Five Becomes Four &gt;&gt;Skip : Cut Me , Mick <p> spotlight <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Boys Like Girls <p> Nearly a year after Boston four-piece Boys Like Girls released their debut album , this infectiously escapist single is shooting up the charts .

The Malibu native 's subtly husky voice and laid-back delivery are endearing , though some of the breezy roots-lite numbers would n't sound out of place in a feminine-hygiene commercial .  --  Elysa Gardner <p> &gt;&gt;Download : Midnight Bottle , Tailor Made &gt;&gt;Skip : the hyper-sensitive Capri <p> Editors <p> An End Has a Start <p> ** SLEW OF DESPOND <p> Mellower than 2005 debut The Back Room , this sophomore effort adds a Coldplay stamp to the Northern England band 's Joy Division blueprint , softening the sound without mitigating the mood of pure gloom .

Spiffy melodies , thudding bass , clapping hands and rare embellishments sprint efficiently alongside Britt Daniel 's crisp narratives .
