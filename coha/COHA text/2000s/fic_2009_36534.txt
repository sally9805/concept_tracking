professor Blau ! " the student cried out , bounding up the steps . A frenetic session of handshaking ensued , but Ruth could see by Ben 's warm vague smile that this young man had him at a momentary disadvantage . <br> The student , or ex-student , was sandy-haired and sunburnt . His aviator sunglasses hung from a braided leather cord around his neck . Now he was telling them about his year as an intern in a senator 's office and how he 'd gotten into the Stanford program . Remember Alison , his girlfriend ? She was in med school and they were getting married in December . Here he glanced shyly at Ruth . <br> A pause . The preliminaries had been gotten through , and Ruth knew all too well what would happen next . The student would ask Ben 's advice and Ben would dispense it . Ruth would stand there , trapped and excluded , shifting from one foot to the other in an ecstasy of boredom . Twenty minutes , forty minutes . At some point the conversation would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farewells the student would excuse himself . But even then , the danger would not have passed . It had happened more than once that even as Ben 's interlocutor had turned and taken several steps away , Ben remembered some final piece of advice-a colleague to look up , a course to avoid-and actually called the student back . The coffin sprang open and the grinning corpse of the conversation sat bolt upright . <br> Now was the moment to slip away . She smiled her quick sideways smile at Ben , who was too involved in talk to notice , and withdrew to the stone railing . Looking down , she saw a scene of young people standing in conversational knots . This place , known as Nirvana , was the graduate-student bar , a beer-dispensing station operating out of the basement of the chemistry building . Patrons descended into that dank grotto to order their seventy-five-cent bocks and lagers and carried them up into the light of late afternoon to drink them under the dappled shade of live oaks . They arrayed themselves around the grounds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged along the steps of the external stone staircase leading to the second floor . Nirvana was a chronically endangered institution . For years , a counselor at the Wellness Center had been waging a letter-writing campaign against it in the student paper , and the proprietors had recently been put on notice that it would be shut down by the university if a handicapped ramp was not installed . <br> Ben liked to spend an hour or two here on a Friday afternoon perched at the very top of the stone steps , where he could pick his students out of the crowd , or those of his colleagues-not many showed up-to whom he wanted to speak . Ruth had pointed out several times that he was just as visible to people down there as they were to him , but the panoramic view seemed to make him feel secure . On these occasions he drank one beer , two at most . Ruth drank two and wanted two more . <br> She looked down directly on the neatly parted blond head of a young woman who stood flanked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newborn in a front pack . The other had a receding hairline and an Adam 's apple like a swallowed anvil . The patrons here were mostly graduate students , some as old as forty , but their faces were so unmarked as to seem hardly human . Faculty members tended to stay young too , she 'd noticed-perhaps it was the sea of youth washing over them year after year . And when they did begin to show age the effect was often stagy and unconvincing , as though they 'd achieved it by powdering their hair and applying grease pencil to the lines around their mouths . <br> Ruth stole a glance at Ben , who was listening to the student with unfeigned interest . How the student glowed in the light of his attention . Or perhaps that was just his youth , just his health . Ben had turned sixty a few weeks ago , but he was still broad in the shoulder and trim at the waist . Standing in shadow he could almost pass for a graduate student . Could she ? Certainly not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black jeans and clogs and dangling silver earrings . <br> As faculty brat and faculty wife ( or spouse , as the euphemism had it ) and occasional adjunct instructor , she 'd always been a member of what the administration liked to call the " university community . " Though she was permitted to use the gym and the libraries and included under the umbrella of the university 's medical and dental insurance , she was not , apparently , covered by the stay-young policy . She was fifty-six , and looked it . But recently she 'd discovered one of the benign perplexities of aging : despite the increasing efforts she made to conceal them , the cosmetic changes did n't bother her terribly . In the last few years she 'd watched the pleating of the flesh under her chin and the deepening of the seams that ran down her cheeks with a certain dismay but also with an oddly detached sense of satisfaction . It was very much the way she felt twenty-five years ago when she was pregnant , standing nude in front of a full-length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming along , had been her thought then , and that was her thought now too . Coming right along . How was it , then , that most nights she lay awake at three in the morning , brooding about age and death ? <br> Looking down again , she counted three toddlers in the crowd . One slumped in a backpack , blankly mouthing a pacifier . Two staggered unsteadily through a forest of adult legs . They made a pleasant enough sight , she supposed , if one was in a mood to find it so . She was n't . Instead , she was feeling irritated , as she often did these days . Why , she asked herself , does nothing ever happen ? This was a drinking establishment , but no place could be safer or duller . The presence of children made it duller still . Somebody should tell the wellness counselor not to worry : in all the years she and Ben had been coming here , she 'd never seen anyone betray even the mildest symptom of intoxication . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , rendering all these fit young people perfectly placid and well behaved . There were no brawls , no loud laughter , no raised voices , none of the intense intellectual talk Ruth would have liked to become embroiled in . Or would she ? She used to think of herself as an aggressive debater , but she 'd grown shy in recent years , conscious of all she did n't know , easily flummoxed by a challenge . <br> . . . <br> none of Ben 's students knew it anymore , and neither did most young faculty , but twenty-five years ago Ruth had been a writer of some small note . Her first book , published by an academic press , was a collection of carefully crafted short stories in the New Yorker style which got little attention and was reviewed only in the local paper . Under the influence of Alison Lurie 's The War Between the Tates , she went on to try her hand at a short novel-a novella , really-about an assistant professor of ethics with a bullying , womanizing chairman and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it happened to catch the attention of a prominent reviewer , who called it " sharply observed . " Encouraged , she produced another , In These Halls , with the same cast of characters . " Refreshing ! " a second critic said , so she wrote a third , Getting Good . Her publisher packaged the books as a trilogy under that title , which was duly hailed as " acid , " " biting , " and " caustic . " The volume sold surprisingly well and Ruth was summoned to New York and fed cold salmon at lunch by her publisher . <br> Then Isaac was born , and in the milky dreamy years of early motherhood she found she 'd lost access to whatever capacity it was that had called forth all those low-pH adjectives . She looked for it again when he started school , and discovered it was still gone . Not that she stopped writing entirely . During Isaac 's early adolescence her time was divided among part-time teaching , volunteer work , and consultations with his therapists and teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfinished novel . Three years ago , at the advice of her own therapist , she enrolled in a local writing program , where she was the oldest student in all her workshops . She dropped out in the middle of her third semester . For a year after that she worked in fits and starts on another novel , Whole Lives Devoured , two hundred pages of which now lay ignored in a disordered pile on her desk . <br> The paperback of the Getting Good trilogy had long since gone out of print , but you could find it in secondhand bookstores , sometimes in the dollar bins out in the street . She could spot it on a shelf fifty yards away , a compact , chunky book with a pastel three-stripe cover design , like a slab of Neapolitan ice cream . Every once in a while-less and less frequently as the years went by-she would be introduced to someone who would stare at her hard for a moment and blurt out , " You wrote Getting Good , did n't you ? " Ruth would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <br> Now , with Isaac out of the house , she found she could summon forth any amount of useless bile . At a Philosophy Department potluck dinner last spring she had posted herself in the kitchen doorway and observed . How , she asked herself , would she make use of the scene she was watching ? If she squinted hard enough to blur the identities of the guests , she could imagine , just for a moment , evidence of sexual tension in the interaction between a statuesque graduate student and a married faculty member . But it did n't last . There was nothing predatory in his posture , nothing seductive in hers . Could she hope at least that they were sharing confidences ? Probably not . More likely they were complaining about the delinquencies of the registrar 's office or the campus parking situation . <br> That party . It was like a hundred others . The table was laden with the ruminant foods brought by faculty members ( quinoa salads and lentil casseroles ) and the childish sweets contributed by graduate students ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guests grazed at the table , milled through the rooms of the house , paused to take inventory of the books on the shelves . Looking at these people , many of whom she liked , she felt a mild astonishment . My , they were dull ! <br> It was n't that Ruth wanted to promote adulterous liaisons between faculty members and graduate students . All she asked for was a world where the expectations of her childhood might be borne out-a world of background and foreground , light and shadow , up and down . One day when she was ten or eleven , a pair of lovers , both faculty members , both married to others , had come to her parents to confess their intention to run away together . They literally appeared on the doorstep after lunch . Ruth 's parents led them into Ruth 's father 's study-he was a classics professor at a small New England college-where all afternoon the lovers petitioned for their blessing . Ruth 's parents gave them a sympathetic hearing but refused to sanction their plan . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the man , much quiet sobbing from the woman . Pressing her ear against the door , Ruth heard it all . <br> What she needed was a world in which such excitements were at least hypothetically possible . It was n't that she wished to enter into them herself . That was in fact exactly what she did n't want . She was entirely dependent on other people to act it out for her , to provide her with something to observe , something to record , something to speculate about . She did n't require anything splashy ; at this point she 'd settle for a malicious glint in somebody 's eye , a quick exchange of sympathetic glances . But here on this quiet Southern campus she was apparently living at the end of history . There was nothing to write about , no affairs , no scandals , no feuds of any but the pettiest kind . There were misfortunes , more and more of them medical , but misfortune is not the stuff of novels , at least not the kind she wanted to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in most cases they were discreetly ignored . The expectation was that eventually , like tired children , they would learn to comfort themselves and go to sleep . <br> Dull . Dull dull dull . Nirvana was dull . Potluck dinners were dull . Convocations were dull , but luckily she was excused from attending them . Lectures were almost always dull . The department picnic was so dull-four hours of desultory softball in the blazing late-May sun-that she pleaded with Ben to be let out of it . She herself was dull . The other day Ben had run a finger along her cheek and told her she had a pleasant face . A pleasant face ! <br> Of all the dull events in the academic calendar , the annual dinner honoring university chair holders was , in the end , the dullest . It was also acutely frustrating , because it got her hopes up . The chair-holder dinner was the only dress-up occasion of the year . It held the promise of a little glitter , a little transcendence , and every October , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There was a cocktail hour with real bar drinks and white-jacketed waiters ( they were undergraduates , but so what ? ) circulating with trays of hors d'oeuvres . Ruth genuinely enjoyed the early part of these evenings ; she welcomed the chance to observe people from many different vantage points , all removed from the action . She liked to patrol the outskirts of the party on Ben 's arm , pointing out to him the latitude with which some of the honorees and their spouses interpreted the term " black tie . " Even so , there were always a few striking costumes to admire . Last year a quiet little wren of an Indian molecular biologist elicited gasps when she made her entrance in a midriff-baring white satin sari . And there were notables to be spotted-a very new dean , backed up against a wall by a pack of sycophants , or a recent hire in Anthropology with a shaved head and a tattooed neck . Not that there was anything particularly exciting about that : trendy academics were the tamest of exotics , utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeweled leashes by the department chairs who acquired them . <br> Later , sitting at a round table in a partitioned-off section of a commons room , eating hard-to-identify morsels served in nests of frisee lettuce , she paid for her earlier pleasure . Typically she found herself seated next to a professor emeritus of engineering with two hearing aids . On her other side would be a mathematician , or an empty chair . Ben generally had better luck . His dinner partner was usually the conversation-starved wife of the engineer , who kept him occupied with anecdotes about her grandchildren . <br> Dessert was served and watery decaf was poured . The president of the university clinked his glass with his fork and bade various faculty members to come forward to receive praise and parchment scrolls . Then it was time to introduce the speaker , always an academic with a vaguely recognizable name and a long history of coziness with the president . " Now I do n't want to tell tales about Old Joe here , " the beaming , swaying president would begin . <br> Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
