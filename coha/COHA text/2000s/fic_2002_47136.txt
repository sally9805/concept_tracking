In a deep socket of an empty acre lot in South Jersey , a wiry boy with dark eyebrows , burnished blond hair , and thick lenses in his glasses is clearing pathways through the milkweeds , trying to preserve as many of the leafy , muscular stalks as he can . He 's working harder than he 's worked in weeks , so hard that he does n't even hear his father 's car engine in the distance , or his mother ringing the cowbell for him to come inside for dinner . This is Telegraph Hill . This is the first community he 's built that he 's genuinely proud of , from the curving of the cul-de-sacs as they wind through the woods , to the discrete street names he 's penned in meticulous , Early American script on scraps of faux-antique wood he 's pilfered from his father 's workshop : Saybrook Road , Weston Drive , Lavenham Court , Henfield Road . No wonder his fingers are cracked and cut , his toes sore from using the front end of his sneaker as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's about to back up the slope , to look out over his first fully-wooded community , his belief so deep that he can practically see the lanterns trembling on , the hushed couples stepping up the sidewalks toward The Northfield , the most recent two-story model ( vertical rough-hewn siding , copper-hooded bay window ) . Then Tommy Lennox , his neighbor , is walking toward him with a football tucked beneath his arm , the faintest suggestion of a smirk around the corners of his lips . " What 's that ? " Tommy says . <p> A ripple , a blush to his skin . The boy 's pleasure 's been so private , so intimate , that he might as well have been making love to the land . He ca n't even raise his eyes . " A development , " he says finally . <p> He 's heating up inside his shirt . The boy imagines Tommy stepping through the community casually , knocking street signs aside , crushing the tall can that stands for the silo at the entrance . Sweat runs cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , he 's surprised to see the animation in Tommy 's face , the quizzical expression that suggests he 's waiting to be shown around . <p> In no time at all , Tommy 's building his own development , Willow Wood , in the open land beside the single pine along the back of the lot . He 's out there every day , just as the boy is , digging with his mother 's garden shovel , replanting tablets of moss until the knees of his pants are soaked through . But why does n't this feel right ? The boy does n't have the heart to tell Tommy that he simply does n't have the gift for this , that straight streets intersecting at right angles went out with 1949 . And what to make of the names Tommy 's assigned to them : Motapiss Road , Vergent Court . They practically carry an aroma , suggesting all sorts of things no one likes to talk about : flesh , death , the mysteries of the body . At least Tommy 's sister has the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attractive . Though Cathy Lennox 's Green Baye is entirely misnamed ( what bay ? what water ? ) , the boy can not help but be impressed with the added e , and with the skillful way her streets meander down the slope . <p> Still , neither of their projects can stand beside the elegance and understated good taste of Telegraph Hill . <p> Today all the neighborhood children are roaming the field , some down on their knees , others carving out streets , all squinting , foreheads tightened in concentration . <p> The boy looks up at the houses across Circle Lane where he and his friends spend their time when they 're not in school or out here . Of course it would be their misfortune not to live in a real development , but in a neighborhood in which all the houses are decidedly unlike each another , with no consistent theme : Dutch Colonial , French Provincial , California Contemporary . Though his mother tries to invoke the word " custom " as often as she can , he 's not having it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments , places where the wood-plank siding 's coordinated with the trim ( sage-green with aqua , barn-red with butter ) , always that pleasing sense of order and rhythm . How he frets about living in a place with no name . Oh , to say " Timberwyck " or " Fox Hollow East " or " Wexford Leas " and be entirely understood . His dilemma even seems to bewilder that substitute teacher with the kind face and the gray , washed-out hair in whom he confides one day . <p> " You do n't live in a development ? " she says . " How could you not live in a development ? " <p> Flushed , he turns away . <p> " Have you talked to your parents ? " <p> He shakes his head . He steps back from himself , watching : Silent boy , ghost , so weightless and emptied he barely has a body . <p> What would she say to the story The Philadelphia Bulletin 's just written on him : Boy , 12 , Longs to Be Famous Builder ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading orange marmalade on a burnt piece of English muffin as her teakettle whistles on the stove . Would he be real to her now ? Though it tells of the six hundred brochures he 's collected from developments all over the country , and of the fan letters he 's written to Bob Scarborough , whom he wants to work for someday , it frustrates him , if only because it 's written in that cheerful , yet patronizing tone that suggests his work is mere play , that he 'll come to his senses in a few years . Hard not to wince when he sees it tacked to his principal 's green bulletin board . How he hates being on display like that , lying on his stomach in the photograph , marveling at that brochure in his hands ( is it Charter Oak ? ) as if he 'd never seen one before . He 'd like to tell the substitute it 's an ineptly written piece , a foolish piece , but he 's as guilty of the lies as anyone . Why did he simplify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he allow her to think there was something less than profound about the binders of street names he 'd collected ? Here he was , hiding the ferocious depths of his passion inside something harmless and benign , when all he really wanted was to move her , to show her he was in love . <p> When he looks up from his reverie , both Tommy and Cathy and all the others are wandering back toward their houses , the sky charcoal above the rooftops , the trees . <p> He gets down on his knees . He shivers inside his jacket , which he zips , chucking the skin of his throat , but he 'll work long after the streetlamps have blinked on , defying his mother 's cowbell , ignoring his long-division assignment , the piano scales-all those dull , grinding duties that suggest his life has nothing to do with pleasure , the warmth of this soil in his hands . <p> Author Affiliation
