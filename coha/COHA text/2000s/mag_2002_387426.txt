TALKING POINT Headnote Even smart , sophisticated women occasionally make social faux pas . Jane Stanton Hitchcock , author of " Social Crimes , " reports . // When I moved from New York to Washington five years ago , one of the first local stories I heard concerned an ambassador 's wife who almost ruined her reputation in five seconds flat . The story goes like this : Madame X was giving an important dinner party in honor of her country 's prime minister . The president and a host of dignitaries were attending . Madame X was keyed up with the excitement of the evening as she greeted her guests in full view of the Washington press corps . When nearly all had arrived , her social secretary approached Madame X , informing her boss that one of the most influential men in Washington had just called to cancel . Hearing the dire news , Madame X promptly hauled off and slapped the hapless secretary in front of guests and reporters . When dinner was served , Madame X was the main dish . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the perpetrator herself , who , by all accounts , was a fun , gregarious woman , well liked by a wide circle of friends . Her tantrum was the talk of the town because it was so stunning , so public , and so utterly unexpected . Instead of shunning her , friends rallied around her , excusing her behavior as a serious case of hostess nerves . The couple eventually recovered their dignity and their popularity and ended their tour successfully . The incident , however , has passed into legend like some sort of Homeric tale of bad behavior . Though few people lose it to the degree that Madame X did , we 've all had our dark public moments where Poe 's little " imp of the perverse " leaps out of us and makes us do or say something we later regret . Consider the famous New York hostess who had traveled to France to attend a glittering ball . All decked out in couture , she went to the lobby of her elegant hotel only to discover that her limousine had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no taxis , and there were cataclysmic traffic jams . At best , she was bound to be late for the ball ; at worst , she would miss it entirely . It was understandable that she might be a trifle upset . However , instead of adopting a laissez-faire attitude , she started yelling at the concierge : " Ihave to get to this party ! Do you have any idea who I am ? " Her words ricocheted off the lobby walls . She finally hitched a ride with a couple on their way to the same event who had overheard her plight . ( Who had n't ? ) They graciously took her along with them in their car , then ungraciously repeated the story to the host once they arrived . The next day the contrite New Yorker gave the beleaguered concierge a huge tip . People who know her say she does n't fly off the handle as readily as she once did . Perhaps she was chastened by the flurry of gossip . Places of luxury commerce , such as department stores , boutiques , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior because many people feel the spending of large sums of money entities them to throw their weight around . In a posh department store recently , a very good customer publicly berated a salesperson and threatened to have her fired for the apparently federal offense of failing to hold the size-eight designer dress she had reserved . The young saleswoman , new on the job , apologized profusely . Not good enough . It seemed only a dressing down could atone for this dressing screwup . Finally , a fellow shopper stepped in , saying , " Excuse me , have we learned nothing from September 11 ? It 's just a dress . " Seized by mortification , the irate woman got a grip on herself and apologized . She has not been seen in the store since . Within the bounds of bad behavior are lesser offenses , among which is the simple gaffe , wherein one does something unwittingly gauche . A notable gaffe occurred recently at a literary soiree in New York , where a group of luminaries read from new works of fiction . Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man loudly asked a prominent editor sitting across from him what she had thought of the evening . The editor said she thought it was a triumph , except for " that blonde woman who read interminably . " The editor went on , " Someone should really have shut her up . Who the hell was she , anyway ? " " My wife , " the man said . The editor was so embarrassed she left the table . But she had merely done what we all do on occasion : tell the blunt truth when someone asks us a question . My view is : Let those among us who have never made asses of ourselves in public cast the first stone . The bright side of the humiliating gaffe is the hours of pure , unadulterated self  --  contemplation it affords one . The whole world stops , and you get to be the center of attention for one bright and ugly moment-a moment the artful mind can magnify into hours of justifiable masochism . " I was so humiliated " sounds much better to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just as " The world will never forget what I did " sounds so much better than " The world could n't care less what I do . " In general , bad behavior in any form is like a kind of illness . If it falls on someone else , you pity them , while thanking your lucky stars it 's not you . If it falls on you , you can think of nothing else . Your mind runs in obsessive circles imagining how you could have brought such a terrible fate on yourself , how people are talking about nothing else , and how you will never recover . The very worst examples of bad behavior involve romance . Here , recourse is often slim to none . Take the single woman who got a little tipsy one night and started teasing a good friend 's husband . Seated beside him at a dinner party , she laughed and talked with him almost exclusively , touching him flirtatiously on his arm , on his hand , and once even on his cheek . Oblivious to the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing a minor scene . After dinner , however , the man 's wife was icy to her , leaving without saying goodbye . The next morning , the single woman called up her friend and rattled on about the evening when she noticed the dead silence on the other end of the phone . Finally , the single woman said , " I hope nothing 's the matter . " To which her friend replied , " Never call me again , " and hung up . The single woman immediately sat down and wrote her good friend a heartfelt , hand-delivered apology , but it was returned unopened . Now , whenever they see each other in public , her former good friend cuts her dead . Of course , bad behavior can sometimes lead to happiness . Several years ago , I was at a huge dinner party given in honor of a famous photographer at the New York Public Library . I found myself seated beside a divine man on whose other side was a woman who got so drunk she literally fell under the table halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an old friend of hers , gallantly picked her up from the floor and persuaded her with some difficulty to let him escort her home . As a result , my divine dinner partner was stranded with no one nearby , save me , to talk to . We were getting along famously when the toasts started . A bright , articulate man stepped up to the microphone and began a toast that quickly derailed into a long , rambling discourse with frequent failed attempts at humor . The harder he tried to make the audience laugh , however , the more obstinate we became . At one point , he lost his temper . " Laugh , " he commanded us . " It 's hilarious . Do n't you get it ? Here , let me explain it again .... At the end of this strange evening , the divine man said to me , " I hate for us to part after all we 've been through together . " We did n't part for long . Now we 're married . That 's why I moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft spot in my heart . Sidebar One woman kept touching her friends husband flirtatiously , causing a minor scene .
