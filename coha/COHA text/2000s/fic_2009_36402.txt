Eve <br> I came upon my son 's body by the river . The morning was no hotter or drier than usual , but as I crossed the plains between the house and the river , the wind kicked up the dust clouds , and I had to hold my robe over my nose . Dust clung to my wet face and marked the crooked trails of my tears . Behind me , the sky was the color of lettuce . The sand chafed my swollen feet , and my groin ached with the pains of Elazar 's birth  --  was it just last evening I had borne him ?  --  and my heart , oh , my heart 's deep sorrow was for the travesty Cain had committed , then confessed to me like a blubbering child . <br> The body was not hard to find . The flies and vultures led me to him , fallen under the date palms , alongside the marshy river . His face was unrecognizable ; Cain had seen to that . I do n't remember if I was sad or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had seen animals killed , their throats slashed and their viscera splayed out on the ground , and certainly there were my babies who were lost . But nothing prepared me for the sight of Abel , my precious son , as still as a rock , his head bloodied and his neck arched back , stiff , at an unnatural angle . His eyes  --  I realize now that it was a miracle they had not yet been pecked out !  --  once full of his vigor and brooding and planning , were empty . They said nothing to me . Of course , Abel had said little to me ever since he took to the fields to tend his goats and sheep , but that is no matter . He was still my favorite . Is a mother permitted to say such things about her children ? <br> I fell to my knees and threw my body over his . I lifted his head , cold and broken , to my breast , and cradled him there , as I had done so often when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strange . It was as though I had been thrown out of the Garden once again , rejected and abandoned , and , as only Adam can testify , they flowed like a river then . And where was Adam , my husband ? Did he not care about our son , the one kissed by Elohim for his magnificent sacrifice ? Or had Adam 's deafness prevented him from hearing my anguished cries when Cain told me what he had done ? <br> Softly , I sang the Garden song into my dead son 's ear . I knew he would hear it , wherever he had gone off to . He had been the only one to understand its message and allure . <br> Abel 's flesh was cold and clammy , and all I could remember was the vision of loveliness he was as a child  --  soft chubby skin folds and eyes only for me . He was the first to bring me gifts  --  poppies and ranunculus and clover , discarded feathers , and pebbles worn smooth by the river and carried down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was too busy traipsing after his father  --  digging , planting , terracing , and experimenting with anything green . <br> What sorrow there is in having children ! At first , they tickle your heartstrings . They linger for your words , clutch at your skirts , feed on your breath , and then one day they lurch to the edge of the nest and flutter out . They never return , and the empty space yawns impatiently , demanding more . It is a never-ending ache , one that I continued to fill as long as I was able . <br> The vultures hissed at me and made loud chuffing noises . They spread their mighty wings and danced about . <br> " Get ! " I shouted , half rising and waving my arms . <br> They did not budge . <br> Where was my Abel ? Where had he gone ? Was he wandering somewhere , looking for his mother ? I wondered if he would weep at not finding me . I remembered Elohim 's words to Adam and me , " For you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still , I did not believe it , did not want to believe it . What good were our lives if , in the end , we simply returned to earthly particles ? <br> To make sense of this tragedy , I shall have to go back to the beginning of that hot summer , preceded by the spring harvest and sheep plucking , when our family 's unraveling began . Unfortunately , it is always in hindsight that we see our mistakes , like a wrong color in the loom or a foreign stalk in our fields , but by doing so , I try to account for my life and change that which I can . It provides a bit of solace . <br> Imagine then : The sun hung low and orange on the horizon , and Naava , my eldest daughter at fourteen years , was lighting lamps in the courtyard . There was the usual bustle of the men coming in from the fields  --  Adam , my husband , from the orchards and Cain , our eldest son , from plowing . Adam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms across my shoulders and squeezed . " Wife , " he said , pecking me on the cheek . " How is my woman ? " He said this laughing , as though he had said the most humorous thing , and I grinned back , glad of his presence . <br> " Your woman is exceptional , " I said . <br> On this particular occasion , Abel was absent . Frequently , he claimed that sleeping among his flocks gave him solitude and peace . Even after Jacan 's discovery that morning . <br> Jacan , my youngest son , had been trembling when he returned at dawn from collecting water at the cistern . We could barely make out his words  --  he was gulping in so much air . " Lion tracks , " he said . " This big . " His little arms stretched wide , and his fingers tried to frame a large circle in the air . " Abel , " he said . " You should stay here today . " <br> Abel had laughed and ruffled Jacan 's hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ? " <br> Jacan 's eyes grew as round as onions , and he stared at Abel . " It 's a big one , " he said , doubtful that Abel understood . <br> Our tools and weapons hung on our courtyard wall  --  adzes , sickles , scythes , hoes , throwing spears , daggers , and bows and arrows . It was to this wall that Abel went . He reached up for a slingshot and a bag of clay pellets . He turned to Jacan and said solemnly , " My aim will be true the first time . " And towheaded Jacan went to him and hugged the huge trees of Abel 's legs , Jacan 's arms seeming so frail to me , like vines trying to find purchase . Oh , how I wanted to grab both of my sons and hold them tight ! <br> Now , the long day over , the purple-gray evening skies pressed in from all sides . Inside the waist-high clay walls of the courtyard , moths and flies were drawn to the flames and danced shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ladled meat into wooden bowls and plucked hot and steaming flat bread from the walls of the tinPru . I smiled to watch her kiss each piece of bread before she placed it on a platter . It was something she had always done from the time she was small and just learning to cook . I asked her about it once , and she said , " But , Mother , all things must be blessed . You said so yourself that Elohim blessed each thing He made . " It was true . I had told her that , although I was beginning to doubt there was a personal Elohim who enjoyed my company . That had been a truth for the Garden , something sweetly shared between Adam and me . <br> Dara and Jacan were in their seventh year . As the sun slipped over the plain 's flat edge , Jacan came running in from the river , knees churning , shouting , " Dara , Dara , Dara ! " as though he were mad . He carried a box turtle from the marsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand in his eagerness to show Dara , it was still alive and moving when he gave it to her . She squealed , of course , then grew morose when the turtle refused to poke its head out . " Mama , " she cried . " Do something ! " <br> I told her to be patient . " The turtle is probably frightened , " I said . " Would n't you be too , if someone was throwing you about ? " <br> So they hovered , squatted down on their haunches , and waited for the turtle 's glorious head to emerge in the twilight . Such is the life of small children ! It never failed to delight me , watching them involved with a task so simple , yet they remained so wonderfully curious and happy . <br> I do not recall what my family talked about that night as we filled our bellies , but I do remember what it was that made us all stop talking . There was a sharp cry in the distance , then a thud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scramble up , because Adam , who was deaf in his left ear , had n't heard . I 'm sure we all looked like baby birds , mouths open , food suspended , for a moment , waiting , waiting , for another noise . What could it be ? <br> " Father , " Cain cried , as he rushed to the courtyard wall and disappeared into the edges of night . <br> Adam , accustomed to this disconnection between his inner and outer world , took his cue from Cain . He jumped to his feet , setting down his bowl . He reached for my hand and held it for a moment . " Stay , " he said to us , and then he , too , was through the courtyard gate . <br> I daresay his command was ignored . Naava had a nose for adventure and for everything else out-there , a desire I could never quite understand . It was a compulsion that neither of my other girls seemed to possess . She rose , and though I called sharply , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished . <br> " What is it , Mama ? " said Dara . <br> " The lion ! " said Jacan , yanking on Dara 's arm , then looking at me , fear solid in his eyes . " Abel ! " <br> Aya 's voice was calm and contemptuous . She had no time for silly conjectures . " Abel is in the hills . How could we hear his voice from here ? " <br> Jacan 's face registered confusion for a moment , then he rallied . " Maybe he was on his way home because he was lonely , and the lion attacked him . " He turned to me . " Father will save him , right ? " <br> I waved his worries aside and began collecting the bowls to scour with sand , but Jacan 's words gave me goose skin . What would happen if I lost my son ? <br> I tended a small collection of burial mounds in the garden that Adam had planted for me  --  a son whom I had borne before his time , a daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged , dead , with knots in her cord  --  but this was different . Abel was a grown man , with curls of hair on his chest and a gruff voice and somber moods . He did not belong in the ground , away from his family , silent , covered with dirt and thistle and mesquite . <br> Because I have given life to each of my children , I love each one . Cain  --  for his ingenuity . Abel  --  for his sweet ways . Naava  --  for her feistiness . Aya  --  for her resourcefulness . Jacan  --  for his tender heart . Dara  --  for her compassion . But in times like these , a mother 's mind flashes to  --  oh , think me not cruel !  --  whom of her children she would most like to hold fast , if given the choice . Although I strive to treat each equally , my heart can not be led like Abel 's sheep . It is stubborn and goes where it likes . I do not find any solace in this truth ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love comes in shades of color . There is a bright pulsing red , and there is a weakly washed pink . I do not know why ; I only know that it is so . <br> So , truth be told , it would have been Cain I would have sacrificed , if I had been forced to choose . Cain always grappled for his significance with the universe , his superiority over all of us , even his disgust with us . It was as though he were made in the starry heavens yet housed in a fragile warm shell that was susceptible to injury and ache and decay , and the frustration for him was too much . <br> As a child , Cain tortured and killed frogs , birds , and lizards . He baited the ducks at the river by hooking a bit of bread and waiting for an unfortunate one to pluck at the morsel and swallow it . He sliced open their throats , then cut them apart , determined to find out what made them breathe or walk or fly . <br> Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small thing as splitting a pomegranate between him and Abel . <br> " You 've given him more , " Cain would squeal in fury . <br> " Here 's a bit more then , from mine , " I would say , and give him another section . <br> " I want it from his ! " Cain would say between clenched teeth . <br> " That 's enough , " I would say . <br> From Abel , there was nary an unkind word or threatening look . <br> He was a summer rain . <br> That night , I quelled a gasp in my throat . Not Abel , please not Abel , I prayed . I prayed to the One who had formed us in the Garden , the One whom I had talked with there , and the One whom I did not believe cared for me anymore . <br> The reason I prayed was simple : I prayed to Him because it was the only thing I could do . True , my energy was irrational and ill-founded , but nonetheless I invoked Elohim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give heed to my prayer . I shall shout Your praises to the sky . Let me not be ashamed . <br> And so it came to pass that , as I prayed , the winds of my heart blew no more . It was quiet , and I sat to hear what He would say to me . <br> His words never came . <br> <br> Naava <br> <br> Eve closes her eyes and rests . She 's been holding her head up this whole time , straining to make herself heard . Her hair is white now , splayed out like a sun-bleached starfish upon her pillow . <br> Naava places a cool cloth on her mother 's forehead . " Shhh , " she says . " Lie back . " She stares at Eve 's face , the bear-clawed scars on her right cheek , the irregular brown spots on her hands and arms , the deep lines in the skin around her eyes and lips , and the frown cracks between her eyebrows . Naava wonders why her mother is so dramatic , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can experience the same thing and come away with two different stories ? <br> Naava takes Eve 's hand , knobbed like a piece of gingerroot . She traces the swollen rivers of blood in Eve 's veins , shutting them off , then letting them rush forth under the skin . She remembers : sitting with Aya and the younger children by the pond , under the shade of Eve 's beloved Garden of Eden tree , telling Eve 's stories to one another in the heat of the afternoon , while the asps warmed themselves and the bees buzzed above their heads . They played the parts  --  the serpent , Eve , Adam , even the cherubim and the wavering lights . Once , Aya insisted they all chant to Elohim , asking that they be able to return to the Garden , to see where their mother and father had come from . Elohim answered in a breeze ; His words sounded singsongy and soft . What 's done is done , my children . His swift reply only encouraged Aya in her attempts at further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was petrified . Voices should come out of people , not out of thin air . Really , she was n't even quite sure she 'd heard anything at all . <br> Naava felt this : Eve knew so little of what had happened because she saw only what she wanted to see and loved only what she wanted to love . She herself had said this in so many words , had n't she ? <br> Continues ...
