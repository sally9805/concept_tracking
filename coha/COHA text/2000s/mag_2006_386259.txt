. Update your air-conditioning system the easy way . MARINE AIR MAKES IT SIMPLE TO INSTALL A NEW AIR-CONDITIONING system or replace your present one to get more cooling and more efficiency than your present unit may be delivering . I installed a new Marine Air ( www.marineair.com ) 10,000-BTU Vector Compact self-contained , reverse-cycle unit in my boat in a day , eliminating a bunch of wires in the process . The old unit 's compressor had stopped cycling on . With the new Vector , my tiny 2.5-kW Mase genset provides all the current needed . The Vector Compact was designed to be the smallest water-cooled , self-contained unit available . Models from 10,000 to 16,000 BTUs ( 10K-16K ) have shrunk even further in the last three years . Ideal for small to medium boats , the Vector comes in 5K , 7K , 10K 12K , 16K and 24K capacities . Having run my Vector while plugged into shore power , I can attest to its efficiency . The bills have been minuscule . I was able to utilize the existing pump , water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to the shorter time in which the boat cools down ( from 83 to 78 in under 30 minutes ) , is the control display  --  digital instead of knobs . The Vector Compact 's controls are connected to the unit with a single wire ( photo above )  --  a far cry from the bird 's nest of wires behind my previous panel . Plugging in is as simple as attaching a phone jack . The unit 's dimensions are less than 13 " ( H ) x 20 " ( W ) x 10 " ( D ) , and both left- and right-blowing versions are available . Everything except the pump is self-contained . I had a convenient position for installation  --  beneath a dinette bench in the main cabin . BOX STEP BY STEP A self-contained air conditioner should be installed as low as possible , but never in the bilge or where engine room vapors are present . There must be adequate provision for downward condensate drainage and all connections must be accessible . STEP 1 Position the unit so that mounting brackets can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return air is available . Make sure there is room to hook up supply air ducts . Use the included condensate drain(s) at the lowest point(s) in the condensate pan to drain to sump or directly overboard . STEP 2 An electrical box is on the unit . Follow wiring instructions using ring terminals . Use the proper size breaker . Ground and bond power source according to ABYC standards . Have an electrician perform this step if you 're unfamiliar with marine wiring . STEP 3 Minimum duct specifications are supplied for each unit . I was able to use the supply air box from my old unit by rotating the blower on the Marine Air unit . The box supplies three ducts : two to the main cabin and one to the V-berth . Ducts should be run as straight and taut as possible with a minimum number of sharp turns . They should be insulated in high-heat areas and also protected in open areas . STEP 4 Hook up the inlet ( use scooptype pickup ) and outlet hoses . The system requires a steady upward flow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outlet flow must be downward . Water should flow from the overboard discharge when the pump is running . Author Affiliation <p>
