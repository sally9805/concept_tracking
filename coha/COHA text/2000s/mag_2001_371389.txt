NATURAL-BORN BLAME TAKERS <P> When the nation is confronted by an incomprehensible horror , Tinseltown 's heavies usually throw up their hands and cry , " Not our fault ! " The events of Sept. 11 have proved a strange exception . Last week ROBERT ALTMAN , director of the satires MASH , The Player and Dr. T and the Women , almost offered a mea culpa . " The movies set the pattern , and the terrorists have copied the movies , " he said . " Nobody would have thought to commit an atrocity like that unless they 'd seen it in a movie . " That self-flagellation comes on the heels of remarks by JFK director OLIVER STONE in which he called the attacks a " revolt " against " order " of the sort created by show-biz conglomerates that " have control of the world .

But both performed without material reward Saturday at the Concert for New York City in Madison Square Garden , a benefit for Sept. 11 attack victims that McCartney headlined .

Short films by Woody Allen , Spike Lee , Martin Scorsese and others paid homage to the city 's spirit , and nonmusical performers stormed the stage in droves ( Harrison Ford , Jim Carrey , Reese Witherspoon and many others ) .
