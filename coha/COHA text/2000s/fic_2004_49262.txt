THE AMERICAN BOY LIVED with his parents in a small villa high on a hillside above a cove where young people danced at night , laughing and shouting , their voices rising through the olive trees to him as he fell asleep . Sometimes he did not know which was the real story . The Ligurian Sea below him in the night , where a poet had drowned long ago . The laughter and shouting below him that drowned out the whispers of that sea and the mutterings of that poet . The boyish face he saw in the mirror when he dared to look . The things he made of paint and clay and words that only he knew about . It did n't matter , he told himself - it was all real and yet it was not - but the question was always there as he fell asleep and woke . <p> In the top drawers of his bedroom dresser , with every color of modeling clay , he had made a world and knew its story perfectly . " The Seven Daughters of Satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully the valley , the forest , and the seven villages where the daughters of Satan , who had abandoned them , had grown up . The men of the villages were scared of the daughters , beautiful as they were , because they knew who they were . The daughters showed no dark gifts , no witch 's skills or demonic tendencies , but the men of the villages felt it : The waiting . The waiting for him . The entire valley and the mountains that surrounded it were waiting . If you held your breath and stayed entirely still , you could even hear it : The ticking of God 's great clock . The hour did n't matter . What mattered was that the ticking never stopped . The men heard it as they stared , hearts breaking , at the faces of the seven daughters , and did not take a step toward them . The daughters did not understand . They could not hear the ticking , They did not know how much the men wanted them . <p> The daughters kept more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A child might run up to one of the girls and say something , hand something to her , take something away , even play with her . But the adults never took such a chance . The daughters grew more sullen , their white faces and their red lips once like seven Sleeping Beauties , but now like fading ghosts . He will return , the villagers whispered to themselves . Inside their thatched house , in which the daughters had grown up and in which they slept side to side on mats on a clay floor , they had a deaf nanny to watch over them . The nanny could not hear the ticking either , and was growing blinder each year as well . <p> Each daughter had a dresser built years ago when the daughters were little by men from the villages . In each daughter 's dresser there were seven drawers , and in the top drawer , made of clay and fashioned by the nanny 's son ( who lived with them but slept in a separate room ) was a replica of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The villagers knew that late at night little people of clay , homunculi , were brought to life by supernatural power and moved through the clay village in each drawer to entertain the lonely daughter it belonged to . <p> One day the boy , who was not from this valley but knew its story , found the smallest and prettiest of the daughters and stood before her , big and gangly in his dark suit , his skin on fire from self-consciousness . She was , he saw , as scared as he was . <p> " Are you my father ? " she asked . <p> " No , " he answered . " I am a boy . " <p> She nodded , smiled a little , and let him take her in his arms , dancing her across the cobbles of the village square to music that came not from guitars or other instruments , but from the throats of the villagers as they stood and watched and began to hum , the sound soon filling the valley like the voice of God . <p> Before long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When strains of 1950s songs like " Diana " and " Heavenly Shades of Night " and " Candy Man " and all the others reached the boy from the lido , that outdoor dance floor in the cove far below his bedroom window , he would lie in bed thinking of the boys and girls - a few years older than he and flirting in another language - dancing . He would not get up . he would not turn on a light . He would listen to the songs until he fell asleep . As he slept he dreamed long , adventurous dreams of strange places , heroes and creatures worthy of legends , but also shorter dreams about hills covered with vipers and funerals of his relatives and a little boat in a storm , sinking , and it was these shorter dreams that came true . Why they did , he did n't know . It made no sense , but what did in life anyway ? The longer dreams became stories which he wrote in longhand and kept secret from his parents in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept secret . <p> The ones that came true he never wrote down . It frightened him to do so . When he woke from his dreams , he would go to school with his friends from the village , or go down to the wharf by himself to find seashells among the colorful fish in the nets , or walk along the dirt road that led from his house past the walls with their brave green lizards to the Hotel Byron . One day his parents said it : " That hotel is too new . It could n't be where they lived . " " Who ? " the boy asked . " Mary Shelley and her husband Percy , " they answered . " The woman who wrote that book . The one about the monster . Frankenstein . " Not long after he would learn from someone that Percy , her husband , the poet , had drowned one stormy night in his little boat as he made his way from Viareggio up the coast back to this very village . <p> When the boy was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came true - had stopped , and he no longer wrote stories or made things of clay to put in drawers , he learned that that woman , Mary , had dreamed her dream - the one that had become her sad and terrible book - in that little fishing village , too . <p> Often , years later , when he was a man and had a wife and children , he would try to remember what had happened to the drawer and its mountains , valley , villages and people of clay . " The Seven Daughters of Satan , " he had called it . This he could remember , but he could not remember what had happened to that clay . Did it matter ? Were n't people - your wife , your children - what mattered ? Then one night , as he lay beside his wife , she put her arm over him and whispered in the dark , " Thank you for setting us free , " and he knew which story it was and how there would never be anything as real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> IMG
