Robert Kerley used to keep his money with a big national bank , and every time he visited his branch , he felt like a walking account number . Tellers rarely greeted him by name , as he had come to expect in Winona , Minn. , a town of 27,000 where people tend to know one another . And despite being a longtime customer , he would be fingerprinted with invisible ink when he wanted to make multiple transactions . <P> A supervisor at a small electronics firm , Kerley , 42 , was looking for a homier bank when his teenage son told him about a community credit union called Affinity Plus . Kerley had never heard of it . But he joined , and he now sees no reason to bank elsewhere . " I pay lower fees and get better interest rates , " he says . " And they do n't ask for my fingerprint . " <P> Thanks in good measure to disenchanted bank customers like Kerley , the fortunes of credit unions have turned for the better . Long content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions had emphasized friendly customer service while seeming oblivious to shifting customer needs . Recently they have realized that they must evolve and grow  --  or perish  --  and many are meeting the challenge with services such as online banking and a nationwide ATM network . Federal rules intended to promote the industry 's expansion recently took effect and should enable credit unions to compete even better against banks . <P> With $570 billion in assets , up 29% in the past two years , credit unions have grown at about four times the rate of the $8 trillion commercial-banking industry . And as credit unions have steadily consolidated , membership has risen annually , to 83 million clients today . " Banks take the consumer for granted  --  and for an awful lot of money , " says Dan Mica , president of the Credit Union National Association , the industry 's largest trade group . " They are tacking on fees and have less interest in serving small businesses than they used to . We 're filling the vacuum . " <P> If you 're confused about what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , which date to the mid-1800s , took off during the Great Depression as not-for-profit , tax-exempt organizations through which workers in a company could pool their savings to qualify for loans for cars and other big-ticket items . About 10,000 exist today . The Navy 's is the nation 's largest , with 1.25 million members , while some have fewer than 500 members . Roughly 60% of credit unions are federally chartered ( the rest have state charters ) and supervised by the National Credit Union Administration . Nearly all , including state-chartered credit unions , are federally insured . Most provide the basics ( checking and savings accounts , credit cards and home and car loans ) , and they tend to offer lower fees and loan rates than banks , and higher returns on deposits . <P> Until recently , the trade-off for such goodies was that most credit unions were less convenient in some ways than banks . But many today offer nationwide ATM access through a surcharge-free network formed with other credit unions ( most also offer ATM access through commercial banks ' networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore up profits in a weak economy , credit unions seem to be benefiting from a consumer backlash.
