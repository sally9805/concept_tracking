Why drug companies should be terrified of daytime TV . <p> Princeton , N.J. lawyer John Sakson handles the usual array of personal injury suits . But he has also turned into an expert of sorts on the virtues of daytime television . It 's there that his firm spends up to $80,000 a month soliciting potential plaintiffs . Some of his advertising is aimed at slip-and-fall and medical-malpractice victims . But these days he 's also trawling for much bigger fish  --  plaintiffs for deep-pocket attacks on big corporations , especially pharmaceutical companies . <p> A 1977 Supreme Court decision interpreting the First Amendment opened the door to lawyer advertising . At first the TV ads were for walk-in divorce and estate work . Now , much of the time , the ads are aimed at stirring up litigation against the likes of Novartis , American Home Products and Johnson &; Johnson . Last year in the top 75 TV markets , some 2,000 lawyers ( out of the nation 's 1 million ) spent $230 million advertising their services . <p> Network Affiliates , the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 90 markets and says one-third of its $20 million in legal billings comes from pharmaceutical litigation ads , compared with maybe 1% a decade ago . <p> Why the surge ? Drug recalls have multiplied in recent years and lawyers have taken notice . The TV ads are the starting point in drawing the thousands of clients who later become plaintiffs in mass suits against drug companies . Typically lawyers like Sakson pass on such cases to bigger firms experienced in mass torts who do n't want their hands dirtied by TV advertising . <p> Sakson , 47 , and his firm have the medium down pat . He knows ads running during the day attract the poor , the disabled , the unemployed and others who may not know where or how to look for a lawyer . Real-life judge shows like Judge Mills Lane and Judge Judy are jackpots . Talk shows like Montel Williams are effective , too . Jerry Springer 's audience was a fertile source of clients until , strangely enough , producers toned down the scratching and hair-pulling . And never run ads on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in a litigious mood , he says . <p> " This is how you reach people these days , " shrugs Sakson , whose firm , Stark &; Stark , advertises to the 2.8 million households in the Philadelphia TV market . <p> The path to a mass tort begins when lawyers like Sakson hunt through medical journals and newspaper stories for drugs with potentially dangerous side effects . When he saw last year that companies were recalling over-the-counter drugs ( like Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold and Robitussin-CF ) containing phenylpropanolamine , or PPA , because of the risk of stroke , he called Network Affiliates to get an ad ready . <p> Then Sakson spoke with Martin Rubenstein , a partner at Levy Angstreich , a large Philadelphia firm with experience litigating mass torts . They cut a deal : Sakson 's firm would pay to run the ad , screen callers and then refer potential plaintiffs to Rubenstein , who will handle the actual prosecution of the cases . Sakson 's take ? He wo n't say , but a typical deal in tort work calls for the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award . <p> This is a good deal for Rubenstein , too . By having lots of clients who can blame their strokes on the recalled drug , his firm is in a good position to be appointed by a judge to the potentially lucrative steering committee of lawyers that will oversee all suits on this chemical . Also , by cutting the deal with Sakson , Rubenstein 's firm can distance itself from crass ambulance chasing . Rubenstein says his firm has no ethical problem with advertising ; it 's just that Sakson has more experience doing it . <p> Sakson added a phenylpropanolamine ad to his daytime TV rotation of four different ads , each running four times a day , Monday through Thursday . The ads use scare phrases like " FDA Investigation , " and feature hospital patients hooked to IV units . They conclude with a group shot of the law firm , which the gentle voice of the narrator assures you is " there for you when it matters most . " <p> His advertisements typically generate 8 to 20 calls a day , 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides the $80,000 a month , is for three full-time employees who screen calls . Sakson expects to eventually recover four to six times those costs . <p> Of course , Sakson has some risk here . He ran the phenylpropanolamine ad for four months , collecting a handful of potentially lucrative cases . But it could be three to four years before any of the cases go to trial or settle . And they could be losers . Billions of doses of the drug ( a cousin of amphetamine ) have been consumed since it hit the market 65 years ago . Proving a link between a single dose and a stroke will be tough , considering the number of other potential causes . <p> Until then there are plenty more cases on the way . In the last five years companies have withdrawn 13 drugs after reports and FDA warnings about potentially severe side effects , compared to just 9 drugs in the 24 years before that . Lawyers are on TV advertising for cases arising out of Glaxo Wellcome 's ( now GlaxoSmithKline ) recall last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken off the market , as well as ephedra , an herbal supplement , still on the market , that has been associated with heart attacks and seizures . In August Bayer withdrew anticholesterol drug Baycol after reports it caused potentially fatal muscle damage . Ad agencies worked quickly , and within days the first Baycol litigation spots began appearing nationwide . Several class actions have alread y been filed . <p> The potential payoff is huge . American Home Products has paid out $12 billion in claims involving the fenfluramine-phentermine diet pill combination . In September ten plaintiffs won $100 million in a Mississippi jury trial in which they alleged that Johnson &; Johnson knew its heartburn drug Propulsid could cause severe side effects but failed to warn the public . Since the drug was taken off the market in July 2000 , 145 other plaintiffs have trooped into the same sympathetic court . Throughout the country , lawyers are advertising for still more . Rx for Litigation <p> Drug companies have taken 13 medicines off the market in the last five years , some listed here . Plaintiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can claim an injury . BAYCOL / Bayer <p> Cholesterol drug used by 700,000 Americans brought in $210 million in sales . Taken off the market in August after reports it caused severe muscle damage . At least seven firms announce lawsuits by the end of the month . <p> LOTRONEX / GlaxoSmithKline <p> Approved Feb. 2000 to relieve irritable bowel syndrome . Withdrawn in November after 70 suffered side effects , including three deaths . Suits announced in West Virginia and Pennsylvania . <p> PPA / Several major pharmaceuticals <p> Phenylpropanolamine , a common ingredient in diet pills and over-the-counter cold remedies , withdrawn in November after reports it can cause stroke in women . <p> PROPULSID / Johnson &; Johnson <p> Heartburn drug withdrawn in July 2000 made $660 million in annual sales . Now J &J; fights 155 plaintiffs in a $1.2 billion Mississippi lawsuit , plus 1,500 in a Louisiana federal court . <p> REDUX/PONDIMIN / American Home Products <p> Massive recall began Sept. 1997 after reports diet pill combination fen-phen caused heart-valve damage .
