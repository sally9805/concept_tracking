Me , Me , Me i have a dream I want to be famous . Really famous . I want to be so famous that movie stars hang out with me and talk about what a bummer their lives are . I want to beat up photographers who catch me in hotel lobbies with Winona Ryder . I want to be implicated in vicious rumors about Drew Barrymore 's sex parties . And , finally , I want to be pronounced DOA in a small , tired LA hospital after doing speedballs with Matt Damon . I want it all . I want the American dream . fame I realized a long time ago that the best way to get famous in this country is to become an actor . Unfortunately , I 'm a terrible actor . I 'm not even a mediocre actor , which rules out a second attractive path : marrying an actress ( they inbreed , so you ca n't marry one unless you are one ) . For a while I thought about becoming a rock star , but for that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a studio executive , and somehow I just could n't foresee either of those little scenarios in my immediate future . So that really leaves just one option : to be very young , very cool and very , very rich . The great thing about this particular path to fame , Oprah and line jumping at nightclubs is that it 's open to everyone . They say anyone can make it in this country , and it 's true : you can make it all the way to the top and a vacuous , drink-slurred lunch with Madonna . All you have to do is find something you 're good enough at to make a million dollars , and find it before you'retwenty-five . When I think about how simple it all is , I ca n't understand why kids my age are so pessimistic . why you should be a millionaire I read somewhere that the average adult has three million-dollar ideas per year . Three ideas a year that could make you a millionaire . I guess some people have more of these ideas and some people less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most idiotic of us has to score at least one big idea during our lifetimes . So everybody 's got ideas . Ideas are cheap . What 's unique is the conviction to follow through : to work at it until it pays off . That 's what separates the person who thinks I wonder why they ca n't just make shampoo and conditioner in one ? from the one who thinks Now , should I get the Mercedes , or another BMW ? Three million-dollar ideas per year . For a long time , I could n't get this out of my head . And there was always the chance I could have an above average idea , because they 've got to be out there , too . The ten-million-dollar ideas . The fifty-million-dollar ideas . The billion-dollar ideas . the idea The interesting part of my life starts at ten past two in the morning of January 7th . At ten past two on January 7th , I am twenty-three years and six minutes old . I am just contemplating how similar this feeling is to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it happens : I get an idea . " Oh shit , " I say . " Oh , shit . " I get up and hunt around my room for paper and a pen , ca n't find either , and eventually raid the bedroom of the guy I share my apartment with . I scribble on the paper and get a beer from the fridge , and by the time I 'm twenty-three years and four hours old , I 've worked out how I 'm going to make a million dollars . now hold on there , smart guy Okay . So how do I know this idea is so good ? a little explanation When I was in my senior year of high school , the counselor said , " Now , Michael , about college ... " " Yeah ? " I was distracted at the time by cheerleading practice outside his window . Or maybe I was just inattentive and daydreaming of cheerleaders . Not sure . " I 'm doing pre-law . " This was my plan . I 'd had it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I mean , just having a plan was a big deal . When people ( like my parents ) asked , " And what are you going to do after high school ? " I could say , " Pre-law , " and they 'd smile and raise their eyebrows and nod . It was much better than my previous answer , a shrug , which tended to attract frowns and comments about youth unemployment rates . " Yes , " the counselor said , and cleared his throat . Outside the window , or inside my mind , cute girls twirled red-and-white pom-poms . " I think it 's time we looked at something ... more realistic . " I blinked . " More ... ? " " Let 's be honest , Michael , " he said gently . He did n't have a particularly gentle faceit was kind of bitter and jadedand the effort he made to twist it into something sympathetic was a little scary . " You do n't have the grades for it , do you ? " " Well , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stopped . Because there was no but . I did n't have the grades . My plan , perfect until this moment , was missing this small but crucial step : good grades . " Shit , " I said . backup And were n't the parents pissed . If I 'd been fooling myself , I 'd been fooling them worse . They were already picking me out a dorm at Harvard and talking about Stanford as a " backup . " It was a little difficult for them when I broke the news that I was going to need a backup for my backup . When the only school that would have me was Cal State , they moved to Iowa . I 'm still not sure if that was coincidence . college I majored in marketing because I was late for registration . I mean , suddenly I was in college ; I was in a dorm and I was surrounded by college girls . There was a lot on my mind . Now , sure , there were upperclassmen and faculty advisers dedicated to making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't hard to ditch them in favor of more horizon-broadening pursuits . My biggest mistake was making friends with a guy who had just transferred from Texas and was pre-enrolled : I forgot all about registration . I was scheduled between ten A.M. and eleven , and I turned up at four the following Thursday . I was lucky anyone was still there , because by then enrollments had officially closed . When I tapped on the glass door , my choice of two first-year electives was reduced to three sad little tables : Programming in Visual Basic ; Masculinity in the New Millennium ; and Introductory Marketing . Masculinity in the New Millennium was actually kind of interesting . But Marketing was unbelievable . mktg : a definition Marketing ( or mktg , which is what you write when you 're taking lecture notes at two hundred words per minute ) is the biggest industry in the world , and it 's invisible . It 's the planet 's largest religion , but the billions who worship it do n't know it . It 's vast , insidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like a gorgeous , brainless model in LA . A gorgeous , brainless model on cocaine having sex drinking Perrier in LA . That 's the best way I know how to describe it . mktg case study #1 : mktg perfume TRIPLE YOUR PRICE . THIS GIVES CUSTOMERS THE IMPRESSION OF GREAT QUALITY . HELPS PROFITS , TOO . welcome to reality The first principle of marketing ( okay , it 's not the first , but it does n't sound nearly as cool to say it 's the third ) is this : Perception is reality . You see , a long time ago , some academic came up with the idea that reality does n't actually exist . Or at least , if it does , no one can agree what it is . Because of perception . Perception is the filter through which we view the world , and most of the time it 's a handy thing to have : it generalizes the world so we can deduce that a man who wears an Armani suit is rich , or that a man who wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Armani suit " is a rich asshole . But perception is a faulty mechanism . Perception is unreliable and easily distracted , subject to a thousand miscues and misinformation ... like marketing . If anyone found a way to actually distinguish perception from reality , the entire marketing industry would crumble into the sea overnight . ( Incidentally , this would n't be a good thing . The economy of every Western country would implode . Some of the biggest companies on the planet would never sell another product . The air would be thick with executives leaping out of windows and landing on BMWs. ) graduation I ended up taking as many marketing classes as I could , and actually graduated from Cal State summa cum laude . If I 'd just finished pre-law , I 'd have settled into earnest conversation with the top law firms of the country , bandying about six-figure salaries , ninety-hour weeks and twenty-year career plans . Law seems very structured like that . But marketing hates systems . Which is nice , in an idealistic , free-spirited sort of way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job . To get a good job in marketing , you need to market yourself . hello My name is Scat . I used to be Michael George Holloway , but I had no chance of getting into marketing with a name like that . My potential employers , who had names like Fysh , Siimon and Onion , did n't even think I was making an effort . The least I could do was echo their creative genius by choosing a wacky , zany , top-of-mind name myself . For a while , I seriously toyed with the idea of calling myself Mr. Pretentious . But when sanity prevailed , I chose Scat . It sounded kind of fast-track. career plan So , armed with my new name , I was ready to hit the major corporations for a job . I was ready for the work week , tailored suits , corporate golf days , pension plans , Friday night drinks , frequent flyer programs and conservative values . I 'd take it all . But then I get my idea .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
