At a NASDAQ board meeting in Manhattan last month , a visitor approached a compact , white-haired guy who looks as if he belongs in a college chemistry lab and asked if he was thinking about a top job in the new Administration . " No way , " replied Paul O'Neill , with a smile . " I 'm too old . " O'Neill , 65 , allowed as how he might consider running a task force on something really messy and complicated , such as fixing Social Security . But having spent the past 23 years running Alcoa and International Paper , O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo were looking to step back and enjoy life for a while . <P> That only partly explains why O'Neill had to be coaxed into taking the job of Treasury Secretary . The other reason is that O'Neill did n't know George W. Bush well . So the two men , joined by Vice President-elect Dick Cheney , had lunch in Austin three weeks ago . O'Neill told friends later that Bush and Cheney made him feel like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so candid . <P> They will need to keep that conversation going , because in the 10 years since the fall of the Soviet Empire , the Treasury Secretary has vaulted past the Secretaries at State and Defense in Washington 's pecking order . Our national security is increasingly defined by economics : America now defends currencies more often than it defends borders , and its stability has been threatened as much by Russian hedge funds as rogue Russian nukes . But O'Neill 's immediate task is to translate still nascent Bush economic policies to lawmakers and financial markets at a time when the engine of the world economy is downshifting . " He has been getting ready for this all his life , " said Frank Zarb , chairman of the NASDAQ . " He is honest , straightforward and has a good , hard mind . " <P> Returning to Washington , O'Neill will find himself with new problems but also old friends . O'Neill met Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan back in 1969 , when both men worked as junior aides in the Nixon White House , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whiz at mastering the details of Medicare and Social Security that Gerald Ford 's White House chief of staff , a young guy named Dick Cheney , promoted him to deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget . By 1975 , Cabinet officers like Donald Rumsfeld , the once-and-future Pentagon chief , were trudging hat in hand into O'Neill 's office . <P> O'Neill left government after Ford lost in 1976 and spent 23 years turning cyclical smokestack companies into sturdy profit centers . He first worked his way up the executive ranks of International Paper by boosting the quality of its products , shutting down marginal plants and investing heavily in others . While working at IP in the dark days of the late 1970s , O'Neill made a habit of visiting the plants of competitors overseas that were stealing market share , and then bringing back ways to beat them at their own game . In the late 1980s , he took over as CEO of Alcoa , a company that had just about given up on aluminum as a reliable line of business . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge push for workplace safety , sold its corporate aircraft and hacked away at decades of hierarchy to help encourage ideas from the bottom up . He worked out of a 9-ft. by 9-ft. cubicle on the top floor of the Pittsburgh , Pa. , headquarters . " It 's a pretty nice cubicle , " said a friend , " but it 's still a cubicle .
