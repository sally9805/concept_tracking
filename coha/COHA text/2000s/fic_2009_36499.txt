1 . <br> Once ... <p> The night joggers were out as usual . <p> The young man could see dim figures on the track even in this pale light , slowly pounding round and round the most infinite of footpaths . There would be , he knew , plump , determined-looking women slogging along while fleshy knees quivered . They would occasionally brush damp hair fiercely from their eyes and dream of certain cruel and smiling emcees : bikinis , ribbon-cuttings , and the like . And then , of course , tennis with white-toothed males , wild tangos in the moonlight . <p> And men too of various ages and levels of dilapidation , perhaps also grinding out secret fantasies ( did they picture themselves a Peter Snell held back only by fat or fear as they turned their ninety-second quarters ? ) . <p> The young man stood outside the fence for a few moments while moths attacked the streetlight dustily , leaving him in a dim spotlight of swirling shadows . He loved early fall in Florida 's Panhandle . Leaves would be turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the moist warmth there was a slight edge , though , a faint promise of cooler air hanging in the treetops and close to the Spanish moss . He picked up his small travel bag and went in the gate , walking clockwise on the track toward the white starting post at the head of the first turn . The joggers ignored the stranger in street clothes and he likewise paid them no attention . They would always be there . <p> The high-jump pit had been rearranged , a new section of bleachers added , a water jump installed for the steeplechase . But mostly it looked the same as it did four years ago , the same as a **27;56;TOOLONG oval probably will always look to one who knows a quarter of a mile by the inches . <p> The Games were over for this time around . He knew quite well that for him they were over for good . Four years is a very long time in some circles ; in actual time  --  real-world time , as that of shopkeepers , insurance sellers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps not long at all . But in his own mind Time reposed in peculiar receptacles ; to him the passing of one minute took on all manner of rare meaning . A minute was one fourth of a four-minute mile , a coffee spoon of his days and ways . <p> As with many of the others , he had no idea what he would be doing now that it was all over . It was such a demanding thing , so final , so cathartic , that most of them simply never thought beyond it . They were scattered around the world now , he supposed , doing pretty much what he was doing at this moment : thinking everything over , tallying gains and losses . <p> He was going to have to pick up the thread of a normal life again and although he did not exactly know why , he had to start by coming back here , back to the greenhouse warmth of the Panhandle , back to this very quarter-mile oval that still held his long-dried sweat . Back to September , the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pole-vault pit , looked uptrack to make sure no one was coming , and then walked up to the starting line . God , he thought , one more time on the line . <p> In lane one he stood very still , looking down at his street shoes ( joggers now going around him with curious glances ) and tried to conjure up the feeling . After a moment a trace of it came to him and he knew that was all there would be . You can remember it , he told himself , but you can not experience it again like this . You have to be satisfied with the shadows . Then he thought about how it was in the second and third laps and decided that the shadows were sometimes quite enough . <p> He was twenty-six years , five months , and two days old , and though as he stood there on the starting line he felt quite a bit older than that , the muscles that rippled up and down inside his trouser leg could have only been the result , biologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about all at one time . <p> He tried to focus blurred emotions , a metaphysical photographer zeroing in on hard edges to align in the center square . What was this he was feeling now , nostalgia ? Regret ? His mind double-clutched , asked the musical question : Am ... I ... buhloooo ? <p> He could not tell . He realized again how adept he had become at not being able to tell such things . His emotions had calluses like feet . The starter would tell them to stand tall , so he stood tall for a moment there in the night . There would be the set command and then the gun . He took a deep breath and began walking into the turn in the familiar counterclockwise direction , the way of all races , and thought : the first lap is lost in a flash of adrenaline and pounding hooves ...
