The Secrets of Bats Alice Leung has discovered the secrets of bats : how they see without seeing , how they own darkness , as we own light . She walks the halls with a black headband across her eyes , keening a high C -- cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat -- never once veering off course , as if drawn by an invisible thread . Echolocation , she tells me ; it 's not as difficult as you might think . Now she sees a light around objects when she looks at them , like halos on her retinas from staring at the sun . In her journal she writes , I had a dream that was all in blackness . Tell me how to describe . It is January : my fifth month in Hong Kong . In the margin I write , I wish I knew . After six , when the custodians leave , the school becomes a perfect acoustic chamber ; she wanders from the basement laboratories to the basketball courts like a trapped bird looking for a window . She finds my door completely blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twisting her head from side to side like Stevie Wonder , she announces her progress : another room mapped , a door , a desk , a globe , detected and identified by its aura . You 'll hurt yourself , I tell her . I 've had nightmares : her foot missing the edge of a step , the dry crack of a leg breaking . Try it without the blindfold , I say . That way you can check yourself . Her mouth wrinkles . This not important , she says . This only practice . Practice for what , I want to ask . All the more reason you have to be careful . You keep saying , she says , grabbing a piece of chalk . E-x-p-e-r-i-m-e-n-t , she writes on the blackboard , digging it in until it squeals . That 's right . Sometimesexperiments fail . Sometimes , she repeats . She eyes me suspiciously , as if I invented the word . Go home , I tell her . She turns her pager off and leaves it in her locker ; sometimes police appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems , wants her back . In the doorway she whirls , flipping her hair out of her eyes . Ten days more , she says . You listen . Maybe then you see why . The name of the school is Po Sing Uk : a five-story concrete block , cracked and eroded by dirty rain , shoulder-to-shoulder with the tenements and garment factories of Cheung Sha Wan . No air-conditioning and no heat ; in September I shouted to be heard over a giant fan , and now , in January , I teach in a winter jacket . When it rains , mildew spiderwebs across the ceiling of my classroom . Schoolgirls in white jumpers crowd into the room forty at a time , falling asleep over their textbooks , making furtive calls on mobile phones , scribbling notes to each other on pink Hello Kitty paper . If I call on one who has n't raised her hand , she folds her arms across her chest and stares at the floor , and the room falls silent , as if by a secret signal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the echo of your own voice : who are you ? It answers : what are you doing here ? I 've come to see my life as a radiating circle of improbabilities that grow from each other , like ripples in water around a dropped stone . That I became a high school English teacher , that I work in another country , that I live in Hong Kong . That a city can be a mirage , hovering above the ground : skyscrapers built on mountainsides , islands swallowed in fog for days . That a language can have no tenses or articles , with seven different ways of saying the same syllable . That my best student stares at the blackboard only when I erase it . She stayed behind on the first day of class : a tall girl with a narrow face , pinched around the mouth , her cheeks pitted with acne scars . Like most of my sixteen-year-olds she looked twelve , in a baggy uniform that hung to her knees like a sack . The others streamed past her without looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she stared down at my desk with a fierce vacancy , as if looking itself was an act of will . How do you think about bats ? Bats ? She joined her hands at the wrist and fluttered them at me . People are afraid of them , I said . I think they 're very interesting . Why ? she said . Why very interesting ? Because they live in the dark , I said . We think of them as being blind , but they are n't blind . They have a way of seeing , with sound waves -- just like we see with light . Yes , she said . I know this . Her body swayed slightly , in an imaginary breeze . Are you interested in bats ? I am interest , she said . I want to know how --  She made a face I 'd already come to recognize : I know how to say it in Chinese -- when one bat sees the other . The feeling . You mean how one bat recognizes another ? Yes -- recognize . That 's a good idea , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . Write something in it every day . She nodded vehemently , as if she 'd already thought of that . There are books on bat behavior that will tell you -- Not in books . She covered her eyes with one hand and walked forward until her hip brushed the side of my desk , then turned away , at a right angle . Like this , she said . There is a sound . I want to find the sound . 18 September First hit tuning fork . Sing one octave higher : A B C. This is best way . Drink water or lips get dry . I must have eyes totally closed . No light ! ! ! So some kind of black -- like cloth -- is good . Start singing . First to the closest wall -- sing and listen . Practice ten times , 20 times . IMPORTANT : can not move until I HEAR the wall . Take step back , one time , two time . Listen again . I have to hear DIFFERENCE first , then move . Then take turn , ninety degrees left . Then turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Feet very important -- they are wings ! ! ! I do n't know what this is , I told her the next day , opening the journal and pushing it across the desk . Can you help me ? I tell you already , she said . She hunched her shoulders so that her head seemed to rest on them , spreading her elbows to either side . It is like a test . A test ? In the courtyard rain crackled against the asphalt ; a warm wind lifted scraps of paper from the desk , somersaulting them through the air . The sound , she said impatiently . I told you this . I covered my mouth to hide a smile . Alice , I said , humans ca n't do that . It is n't a learned behavior . It 's something you study . She pushed up the cover of the composition book and let it fall . I think I can help you , I said . Can you tell me why you want to write this ? Why I want ? She stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What is the test for ? Her eyes lifted from my face to the blackboard behind me , moved to the right , then the left , as if measuring the dimensions of the room . Why you want come to Hong Kong ? Many reasons , I said . After college I wanted to go to another country , and there was a special fellowship available here . And maybe someday I will be a teacher . You are teacher . I 'm just learning , I said . I am trying to be one . Then why you have to leave America ? I did n't , I said . The two things --  I took off my glasses and rubbed my eyes . All at once I was exhausted ; the effort seemed useless , a pointless evasion . When I looked up she was nodding slowly , as if I 'd just said something profound . I think I will find the reason for being here only after some time , I said . Do you know what I mean ? There could be a purpose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good . Not sure . You could say that . Hai yat yeung , she said . This same . Maybe if you read you can tell me why . This is what 's so strange about her , I thought , studying her red-rimmed eyes , the tiny veins standing out like wires on a circuitboard . She does n't look down . I am fascinated by her , I thought . Is that fair ? You 're different from the others , I said . You 're not afraid of me . Why is that ? Maybe I have other things be afraid of . At first the fifth-floor bathroom was her echo chamber ; she sat in one corner , on a stool taken from the physics room , and placed an object directly opposite her : a basketball , a glass , a feather . Sound waves triangulate , she told me , corners are best . Passing by , at the end of the day , I stopped , closing my eyes , and listened for the difference . She sang without stopping for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , as if someone had forgotten their mobile phone . Other teachers walked by in groups , talking loudly . If they noticed me , or the sound , I was never aware of it , but always , instinctively , I looked at my watch and followed them down the stairs . As if I too had to rush home to cook for hungry children , or boil medicine for my mother-in-law . I never stayed long enough to see if anything changed . Document everything , I told her , and she did ; now I have two binders of entries , forty-one in all . Hallway . Chair . Notebook . As if we were scientists writing a grant proposal , as if there were something actual to show at the end of it . I do n't keep a journal , or take photographs , and my letters home are factual and sparse . No one in Larchmont would believe me -- not even my parents -- if I told them the truth . It sounds like quite an experience you 're having ! Do n't get run over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever think this way ? these binders would be the record of my days . These and Alice herself , who looks out her window and with her eyes closed sees ships passing in the harbor , men walking silently in the streets . 26 January Sound of lightbulb -- low like bees hum . So hard to listen ! A week ago I dreamed of bodies breaking apart , arms and legs and torsos , fragments of bone , bits of tissue . I woke up flailing in the sheets , and remembered her immediately ; there was too long a moment before I believed I was awake . It has to stop , I thought . You have to say something . Though I know I ca n't . Perhaps there was a time when I might have told her , this is ridiculous , or , You 're sixteen , find some friends . What will people think ? But this is Hong Kong , of course , and I have no friends , no basis to judge . I leave the door open , always , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gates together , late in the afternoon , past the watchman sleeping in his chair . For me she has a kind of professional courtesy , ignoring my whiteness politely , as if I had horns growing from my head . And she returns , at the end of each day , as a bat flies back to its cave at daybreak . All I have is time ; who am I to pack my briefcase and turn away ? There was only once when I slipped up . Pretend I 've forgotten , I told her , one Monday in early October . The journal was open in front of us , the pages covered in red ; she squinted down at it , as if instead of corrections I 'd written hieroglyphics . I 'm an English teacher , I thought , this is what I 'm here for . We should start again at the beginning , I said . Tell me what it is that you want to do here . You do n't have to tell me about the project -- just about the writing . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read them ? She stretched , catlike , curling her fingers like claws . Because I do n't think I understand , I said . I think you might want to find another teacher to help you . There could be something you have in mind in Chinese that does n't come across . Not in Chinese , she said , as if I should have known that already . In Chinese can not say like this . But it is n't really English either . I know this . It is like both . I ca n't teach that way , I said . You have to learn the rules before you can -- You are not teaching me . Then what 's the point ? She strode across the room to the window and leaned out , placing her hands on the sill and bending at the waist . Come here , she said ; look . I stood up and walked over to her . She ducked her head down , like a gymnast on a bar , and tilted forward , her feet lifting off the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stumbled , falling back ; I caught her wrist and she pulled it away , steadying herself . We stood there a moment staring at each other , breathing in short huffs that echoed in the hallway . Maybe I hear something and forget , she said . You catch me then . OK ? 28 January It is like photo negative , all the colors are the opposite . Black sky , white trees , this way . But they are still shapes -- I can see them . I read standing at the window , in a last sliver of sunlight . Alice stands on my desk , already well in shadow , turning around slowly as if trying to dizzy herself for a party game . Her winter uniform cardigan is three sizes too large ; unbuttoned , it falls behind her like a cape . This is beautiful . Quiet , she hisses , eyebrows bunched together above her headband . One second . There -- there . What is it ? A man on the stairs . I go out into the hallway and stand at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very faintly , I hear sandals skidding on the concrete , keys jangling on the janitor 's ring . You heard him open the gate , I say . That 's cheating . She shakes her head . I hear heartbeat . The next Monday Principal Ho comes to see me during the lunch hour . He stands at the opposite end of the classroom , as always : a tall , slightly chubby man , in a tailored shirt , gold-rimmed glasses , and Italian shoes , who blinks as he reads the ESL posters I 've tacked up on the wall . When he asks how my classes are , and I tell him that the girls are unmotivated , disengaged , he nods quickly , as if to save me the embarrassment . How lucky he was , he tells me , to go to boarding school in Australia , and then pronounces it with a flattened A , Austrahlia , so I have to laugh . Principal Ho , I ask , do you know Alice Leung ? He turns his head toward me and blinks more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . You have problem with her ?
