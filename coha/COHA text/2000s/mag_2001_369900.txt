Ask Jacob Underwood of the boy band O-Town what has surprised him most about the music business , and he sighs , " How much of it is business and not music . " It 's an age-old artist 's plaint , but you may wonder how much of a surprise it could have been , given how he came to be here : doing a sound check for a Manhattan party for teen magazine YM . Underwood and his crew found fame through ABC 's reality series Making the Band , which showed boy-band architect Lou Pearlman holding auditions and casting O-Town from scratch . The team behind MTV 's The Real World captured the group 's production , primping , packaging  --  and , of course , fights with girlfriends . A year , several MTV Total Request Live appearances and a platinum album later , the boys are belting out Liquid Dreams ( an almost parodic number about autoerotic fantasies starring celebrities ) , putting touching sincerity into lines like , " And Salma Hayek brings the re-e-est ! " <P> The O-Towners do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . But the obvious comparison of Making the Band ( Fridays , 8:30 p.m . E.T. ; season premiere 8 p.m. , April 13 ) with the ' 60s ' fabricated four The Monkees misses the real difference : Micky Dolenz and his pals relied on an innocent relationship between fans and stars . They were a fantasy the audience gladly bought into : they fought villains and got in slapstick trouble , and no one worried too much about the artifice that created them . <P> In Making the Band , the artifice  --  the sound-enhancing wizardry , the dance drills , the media coaching  --  is the reason for watching . Likewise on the WB 's girl-group incubator Popstars and VH1 's new Bands on the Run , in which real unsigned bands compete to make the most money on an eight-week tour , the entertainment business becomes entertainment . It 's a breed of programming suited to an age when ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY readers and E ! watchers are increasingly attuned to the mercantile biz end of show biz . ( Is action director Michael Bay over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in Hollywood ? ) " Kids today are 10 times more sophisticated about the business than they were even five years ago , " says Making the Band executive producer Ken Mok . " People know more about Puffy as an entrepreneur than as an artist . The Wu-Tang Clan is not just about the music . It 's about Wu Wear . " <P> Of course , ironic detachment alone does n't get teenage girls to buy CDs . Making the Band showed O-Town 's warts , as the group mangled harmonies and struggled to learn discipline , but it was also a priceless showcase for five cute boys . And Popstars ( Fridays , 8:30 p.m . E.T. ) went Making the Band one better by not only creating girl group Eden 's Crush but also giving it a guaranteed contract on a label owned by the WB 's ( and TIME 's ) parent AOL Time Warner . ( O-Town was turned down by several labels before signing with J Records , veteran music exec Clive Davis ' new endeavor . ) Popstars ' treatment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moyers special ; it cheerfully depicts its women as a hungry , hardworking pop juggernaut in leather pants , portraying them with all the hard-nosed pugnaciousness of a Tiger Beat cover . Producers Scott A. Stone and David G. Stanley say there simply has n't been much fighting or failure to show among the final five members , though Stanley also says , " We sold this as a show that would be relentlessly upbeat . "
