Few people know the perils of drug abuse better than a 55-year-old former schoolteacher whose job it used to be to teach that very topic  --  which is why it 's particularly ironic that she 's a cocaine addict today . More than 30 years ago , Gwen  --  who prefers to keep it to one name when discussing her addiction  --  spent her days teaching in the Virginia school system and drafting the schools ' drug-and-alcohol-abuse curriculum . She spent her nights researching the subject firsthand . <P> " I started using alcohol and pot in college , " she says . " Then I turned to sniffing cocaine and freebasing . By the time I began teaching , I was spending big-time money . My body knew that I got out of school at 3:30 every day , and then I 'd have to go out and get my drugs . " <P> Today Gwen spends most of her time far from Virginia , living in New York City and attending regular sobriety meetings in the Odyssey House ElderCare treatment program in East Harlem . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought the drug-abuse classes I taught applied to me , " she says . " But here I am . " <P> She 's hardly alone . Of the more than 75 million baby boomers who came of age in the 1960s and ' 70s , millions experimented with drugs during their impressionable teenage years , and millions went on to enter middle age  --  and are now headed into their senior years  --  with decades-long addictions . Hard numbers are not easy to come by , but older addicts are clearly a growth sector in the drug-recovery industry . There are an estimated 1.7 million Americans over age 50 addicted to drugs , according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) , a division of the Department of Health and Human Services . By 2020 SAMHSA expects the number to reach 4.4 million . Already an ongoing federal study has found that the number of older Americans seeking help for heroin or cocaine abuse roughly quadrupled from 1992 to 2002 . Odyssey House , which was founded to treat younger addicts , now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to deal specifically with older users . <P> What makes the problem especially hard for seniors is that the wages of drug abuse are cumulative . A lifetime of recreational chemistry also means a lifetime of neglect of overall health  --  as a recent morning meeting at Odyssey House illustrated . There were too many canes in evidence for a group so comparatively young  --  the legacy of joints wrecked by years of undertreated diabetes  --  and too many bad hearts and bum livers and vascular systems fighting hypertension . " This is the first generation to have a high incidence of using recreational drugs , " says SAMHSA epidemiologist Joseph Gfroerer . " All this puts them at risk for problems . "
