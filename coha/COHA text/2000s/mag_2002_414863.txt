Stressful conditions may trigger plants and animals to unleash new forms quickly <p> In the late 1970s , a television series based on the popular comic book The Incredible Hulk became a surprise hit . The comic related the adventures of a scientist who studied the effect of radiation on physical strength . After a freak accident in a nuclear reactor , the researcher would temporarily transform into a gigantic , green monster with incredible strength-the Hulk-whenever he experienced stress . The clothes-ripping , skin-coloring transformation of the scrawny scientist into the Hulk was an amusing staple of every episode of the television show . <p> Such a stress-induced makeover is , of course , impossible . Or is it ? Two provocative studies , one published in 1998 on fruit flies and one this year on plants , suggest that organisms developing under stressful conditions can unleash novel mutant forms . In doing so , some biologists speculate , some offspring may quickly adapt to new environmental conditions and improve their species ' odds of survival . <p> This is n't comic book science . The studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein 90 ( Hs ) that 's central to the stress-induced effects . Susan Lindquist of the Whitehead Institute of Biomedical Research in Cambridge , Mass. , who coauthored the two studies , contends that when Hs activity is disrupted during development , genetic variation that 's normally concealed can emerge and generate diverse physical forms of a species . <p> Changes in Hs activity " can act as a mechanism for evolutionary change by covering and uncovering genetic variation , " says Lindquist . <p> Evolutionary plant biologist David Baum of the University of Wisconsin-Madison suspects that Hs does n't stand alone in this surprising story . He says the Hs findings are " profoundly important " because they show that hidden genetic diversity exists within species and can erupt when conditions change . <p> IMPORTANT CLIENTS : In 1962 , scientists studying the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster came across a family of molecules quickly dubbed heat shock proteins . The researchers discovered that when flies are exposed to brief periods of elevated temperatures-a heat shock-their cells activate a group of specific genes . Biologists found that the products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteins fold into their proper shape and become stable . Otherwise , at the higher temperature , many new proteins are unstable or do n't function . <p> The molecular helpers , also called chaperones by some scientists , battle more than heat . Cells make heat shock proteins when flies experience a variety of stresses , such as radiation , starvation , and dehydration . And heat shock proteins are n't limited to flies . Seemingly all plants , animals , and even microbes produce these molecules when cells are stressed . <p> For more than a decade , beginning when she was at the University of Chicago , Lindquist has been studying Hs . Unusual among the heat shock proteins , Hs is abundant in cells all the time , not just during times of stress . Working with yeast cells , Lindquist and her colleagues showed that Hs has a select number of other proteins , its clients , that it stabilizes and folds under normal conditions . Some of these Hsp90-dependent proteins have crucial roles in signaling between cells during an organism 's development . Other clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hs 's role in an organism more complex than a yeast cell , Lindquist and her University of Chicago colleague Suzanne Rutherford turned to fruit flies . In flies , if both copies of a fertilized egg 's Hs gene are defective , the insect does n't develop at all . But if one copy works and the other is mutated , causing Hs activity to be 50 percent of normal , the egg usually develops into a fertile adult . <p> When Rutherford and Lindquist studied flies with such a half-portion of Hs , however , they observed physical abnormalities in about 5 percent of the insects . Misshapen or missing eyes , stubby wings , deformed legs , or antennae growing in the wrong places are just some of the oddities that the researchers documented . Similar developmental defects emerged in the offspring of flies raised on food containing the Hs inhibitor geldanamycin , a compound now attracting the interest of cancer researchers ( see box ) . <p> The two biologists considered several explanations for their observations . In the scenario they ultimately favored , Hs 's role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in genes crucial to an animal 's development . Hs could do this by folding slightly mutated versions of its clients into their normal shapes , for example . <p> By breeding the Hsp90-deficient flies , the researchers showed that individual abnormalities are inherited consistently from generation to generation . That , they said , supports the theory that the defects are caused by mutations freed of some Hs control , rather than by a random mishap triggered by reduced Hs activity at some point during a fly 's development . <p> The role of Hs as a heat shock protein is central to the researchers ' conclusions . They argue that if cells are stressed during development , Hs becomes diverted from its normal protein clientele to stabilize other proteins in cells . As a result , developmental signals normally kept in line by Hs miss that influence , go awry , and change an organism 's body plan . <p> For evolution 's sake , this is n't necessarily a bad thing . With Hs keeping a mutated gene 's protein under control , an organism could accumulate more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then expose that variation in response to environmental stress , permitting natural selection to act upon it , says Lindquist . <p> At the end of their 1998 paper on the fly research , Rutherford and Lindquist offered a provocative conclusion . " We have provided what is , to our knowledge , the first evidence for an explicit molecular mechanism that assists the process of evolutionary change in response to the environment , " they said . <p> The biologists raised eyebrows even more by suggesting that this Hsp90-based evolution mechanism could help explain the rapid bursts of body-plan changes that occasionally punctuate the fossil record . Most evolutionary theory predicts small , gradual changes in a species over long periods and is hard-pressed to explain such morphological explosions . <p> WEIRD WEEDS : Many biologists remained skeptical of Rutherford and Lindquist 's conclusions . To suggest that Hs helps organisms adapt to their environments was a radical notion , especially given that the mutant fruit flies generated by reduced Hs activity had no obvious advantages over normal flies . If anything , their physical defects would make them less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes . <p> In the June 6 Nature , however , Lindquist and two of her University of Chicago colleagues , Christine Queistch and Todd A. Sangster , add another chapter to the story of Hs and evolution . They report that if seeds of the mustard weed Arabidopsis thaliana grow in soil containing the Hs inhibitor geldanamycin , the resulting plants frequently display altered forms , including some that could in theory help a plant adapt to its environment . <p> The researchers found that geldanamycin-exposed plants sometimes grew leaves with an altered shape or color , for example . In other cases , plants had hairier roots than normal , which could improve their uptake of nutrients and water maintenance within the plants . " Having a lot of root hair could be advantageous under some circumstances and not under others , " says Lindquist . <p> As they had in flies , the researchers showed that a trait produced by Hs inhibition could consistently pass from one generation of the mustard plant to the next . This indicated that the trait is encoded in the organism 's genes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after several generations , notes Lindquist , these traits can persist even when a plant 's Hs production returns to normal . This finding is mirrored by fly results , in which an exposed abnormality can persist into later generations that have normal Hs activity . <p> The investigators also demonstrated that , within a line of A. thaliana plants , they could alter the same trait either by growing seeds in geldanamycin-laced soil or by growing them at 27C instead of the typical 22C . The warmer temperature presumably shocks the plant cells , diverting Hs from its normal clients to a generalized stress response . In essence , the researchers say , the change in environmental conditions provided a natural means of inhibiting Hs 's normal role during the plant 's development . <p> Finding that Hs may act similarly in a plant and an insect suggests that its role in enabling organisms to stockpile genetic variation arose early in the history of life , concludes Lindquist . " It shows that this ability to hide genetic variation and reveal it is a very , very ancient thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces plant forms that conceivably have advantages in some environments , the Lindquist team 's new report makes a " considerably stronger case " for Hs 's role in evolution , says developmental biologist Bruce P. Brandhorst of Simon Frasier University in Burnaby , British Columbia . <p> ACCIDENTS HAPPEN : Lindquist and her colleagues are careful to say that they do n't hold that Hs arose to help organisms evolve . Hs 's primary role is to shape crucial cellular proteins , and any influence over evolution is an " accidental " consequence of that function , says Lindquist . <p> Other investigators question the group 's emphasis on Hs . " People are fixated on the heat shock proteins . I 'm not convinced that 's the story , " says Baum . He speculates that changing the activity of other proteins during development may also unleash hidden variation in plants and animals . <p> Evolutionary biologist Gnther P. Wagner of Yale University , who has followed the Hs story closely , says that many issues must be resolved before he and his colleagues accept the idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress . " Is this mechanism at all invoked under natural conditions ? " he asks . <p> Somehow , says Wagner , scientists must find a way to experimentally test whether drops in Hs activity help members of a species adapt to new circumstances . For example , investigators might examine whether a strain of Hsp90-inhibited flies does better in changing environments than a normal strain does . <p> Lindquist is skeptical that such a study would be meaningful . Instead , she and her colleagues intend next to investigate whether they can use geldanamycin to create plant variants that are useful to farmers . Hs inhibition may offer a more natural way to create new plants than the controversial practice of genetic modification does , the researchers suggest . <p> In general , says Lindquist , her group 's work on Hs should persuade evolutionary biologists that they have to focus on more than just genes . " It 's really very important to not just look at DNA but to understand how proteins fold , " she says . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : EYE PROBLEMS  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal frequently develop abnormalities , including missing eyes or a deformed eye . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : MUTANT MUSTARDS  --  In mustard plants with reduced heat shock protein 90 activity , the plant 's normal shape ( center ) can give way to a variety of mutant forms ( surrounding photos ) . <p> By John Travis <p>
