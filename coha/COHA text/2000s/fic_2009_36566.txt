Monday , December 31 <p> TRUE WINTER HIT around eleven a.m. that New Year 's Eve . North winds slanted in , bearing temperatures in the low teens . Iron clouds followed , casting a pale and crystalline-gray glow across the west flank of the Jefferson Range in southwest Montana . <p> Three construction helicopters chugged east toward the remote mountains over a valley cut up into cattle ranches and spliced by a river that ribboned through it . As they closed on the foothills , hail and snow peppered the choppers . Visibility worsened . The pilot in the lead airship grew agitated . <p> " We 're gon na hit big-time snow and crosswinds , " he said into his microphone , glancing at the hard-looking man riding next to him , dressed head to toe in snow camouflage and wearing a climbing harness . " Sure we ca n't postpone , General ? " <p> The general turned his head , revealing the rocky face of a man in his early forties framed with shoulder-length brown hair . " We have a schedule , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The pilot felt the general looking at him and glanced his way again . What he saw in the general 's eyes rattled the pilot , made him feel like he was expendable . <p> " Get ready for one hell of a ride , " the pilot said finally . <p> They gained elevation and entered the clouds . Visibility was less than two hundred feet . Crosswinds buffeted the chopper and it lurched sideways . The pilot fought for control as the helicopter bucked , shuddered , and jolted . Several of the fifteen other snow-camouflaged passengers in the bird 's hold muttered and cursed . <p> " Gon na be worse at ten thousand feet , " the pilot said , gritting his teeth . " I ca n't guarantee you 'll get on the ground alive . " <p> " Abort the first landing zone , " the general said . " Use the secondary . " <p> " It 's a long hike , " the pilot said . <p> " It is what it is , " the general said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other two helicopters . He turned south with the winds . The buffeting ebbed , but visibility remained pea soup . Twice the pilot got too low in the dense clouds and almost clipped the tops of lodgepole pines with his struts . Despite the icy air seeping in the doors of the helicopter , sweat kept beading on his forehead and dripping down his nose . The pilot had flown fifty missions in Iraq and had been twice engulfed in sandstorms in the air , but those experiences were nothing compared to the whiteout conditions he was facing . <p> The general , however , seemed largely unmoved by their predicament . His expression was burned in place , an attitude of calculating , grim determination . He peered back into the chopper 's hold . There was an acidic odor wafting from in there and he recognized it as the scent of soldiers contemplating their mortality . His attention swept over the men and women sitting on benches , strapped to the helicopter 's inner hull . The majority of them wore one version or another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Three of them , however , looked out of place  --  more fearful , more tenuous than the rest of the crew . One man , two women . All of them sitting together , their eyes darting from one to the other . The general caught the eye of the woman closest to him . Early twenties . Cute rather than pretty , short and athletic , her sandy hair was roped up in dreadlocks and a hoop ring pierced her nose . <p> " Are you ready , Mouse ? " the general asked . <p> Mouse gazed at the general as if he were some kind of prophet , saying , " It 's time to make them pay for the hell they 've inflicted on people . " <p> Approval rumbled through the helicopter 's belly . The pale blond man beside Mouse spoke with a thick French accent . " Time to light the fire under their fat asses . " <p> " It is , Cristoph , " the general agreed . " Rose ? Are you not well ? " <p> The miserable-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If this shaking keeps up , I 'm going to puke all over myself . I 'm not used to this kind of crap . I do n't know if I can do the rappel into the second zone . " <p> The general 's features hardened . " You 'll do it or I 'll throw you out the door . " <p> Rose moaned and hung her head between her knees . The general 's attention moved deeper into the cavity of the helicopter to a massive black man with a basketball-like head sitting atop crossbar shoulders . <p> " Truth , get your troops ready , " he said . " Landing zone two . " <p> Truth wiped a boxing mitt of a hand across his muzzle . " Lighten loads ? <p> " We 're already stripped to the essentials . We 're just going to have to suck it up . " <p> The pilot shouted , " Quarter mile , General ! " <p> The general twisted back to look out the windshield . The snow was falling like hundreds of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The footing would be treacherous . <p> " Hundred and seventy-five yards and closing , " the pilot said , watching the readout on his U.S.-military-spec GPS . <p> Truth and two men moved several large rubberized duffel bags toward the side door , which they slid open . Frigid air and swirling snow blasted the inner cabin and brought with them the piney smells of the forest . <p> " There 's your cliff ! " the pilot cried . <p> The general spotted a narrow balcony of rock jutting from the woods , off the side of a gorge two hundred feet deep . He pointed at gnarled old pines growing off the near side of the point . <p> " Come about and keep your nose on those trees , " he told the pilot . " If you 're on your game , you wo n't shear the rear blades and kill us all . " <p> The pilot squinted in fear and eased the stick forward . The chopper hovered forward over the stone balcony . Ever so slowly , trembling like a compass confused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Go ! " the general roared . <p> A pair of climbing ropes were flung out the door . Truth lifted the rappelling rack attached to his chest harness , clipped it to the rope , and went out the open side door . He carried a heavy pack with several grenades strapped to the back . He slid from view . The others followed . <p> The general shouldered his pack last , put on goggles , and leaped out the door , sliding down the rope , swinging wildly in the wind . Truth held the rope at the bottom and helped the general off . <p> The general walked the razorback , holding his hands out from his sides like a tight-wire artist , then reached the main cliff and entered the woods on a game trail , moving toward voices ahead . Behind him , the rubber duffel bags were lowered successfully , the first helicopter lifted away , and a second chopper took its place , disgorging more troops and supplies . <p> The general slipped through the trees toward the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brim of his white wool hat , transforming it into a hood with holes cut for eyes , nose , and mouth . He crept into the embrace of a snow-laden fir tree . In his camouflage , the general was for all intents invisible , listening , gauging the people he was leading , looking for any weakness . <p> In the clearing , a lanky man in his late twenties with dark features and a gold front tooth yanked off a glove and with his free hand tugged up the collar of his coat . " We 're taking this to a whole other level now , " he said in an Oklahoma twang . " This is goddamned throwing down the gauntlet . Declaration of fuckin ' war . " <p> Cristoph removed his round wire-rimmed glasses and wiped the snow off them . " The general is right , Dalton , " he said . " We must act . " <p> A tall , attractive Latina woman in her thirties put her pack down beside them , saying , " If not , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 've heard the speech , Emilia , " Dalton said . " I 'm here , are n't I ? " <p> " Are you , Dalton ? " asked a pit-bullish man with a glare like an axe falling and teardrop tattoos under both eyes . " ' Cause if you are n't , you should get the fuck out before the shit hits the fan . Start hiking . Town 's only , what , forty miles ? " <p> " Cobb , there 's a difference between stepping inside the nut house and thinking about it , " Dalton shot back . " We 'll see who keeps it together when it goes psycho . " <p> " Yeah , we will , " Cobb said , giving Dalton a snake 's half-lidded expression . <p> " This is no time for measuring penises , " Mouse said , her voice rippling with emotion . " We ca n't lose sight of what this is for . " She raised her fist . " Remember Seattle ! Change the world ! " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist . <p> The general smiled . <p> Truth and the men from the third helicopter came into the clearing dragging the rubberized duffel bags behind them . They opened the bags and distributed black 9mm Sterling submachine guns and bandoliers of ammunition . <p> The general stepped into the clearing , took his gun , loaded it , and then said , " Okay . Let 's go teach the world a thing or two about justice , Third-Position-style . " <p> Excerpted from Triple Cross by MARK T. SULLIVAN <br> Copyright 2009 by Mark T.
