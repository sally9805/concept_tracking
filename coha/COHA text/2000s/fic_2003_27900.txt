" You exposed your penis on national television , Max . Whatam I supposed to do ? " " I did n't expose it , Howard , it just sort of peeked out . " " It peeked out ' during the Toys for Tots segment in front oftwenty million viewers , many of whom were , not surprisingly , children . It 's twenty-four hours later and we 're still receivingfaxes . The phone lines were so jammed last night that no onecould get through to place orders . Plus I 've got every mother inthe country threatening child-abuse lawsuits . " Howard Toast , the executive producer of the SellevisionRetail Broadcasting Network , glared at the show host who wassitting in a black leather chair on the opposite side of his largeglass desk . Behind Max and facing Howard , a bank of televisionmonitors silently played live broadcasts of Sellevision , QVC , and the Home Shopping Network as well as broadcasts fromthe other three " B-class " networks .

A vein on his temple pulsed . " Max , the other hostswere n't naked under their bathrobes . It 's justwell , there 's noexcuseseven-year-old children and their mothers justshouldnot know that you 're uncircumcised . " He took four Advil fromthe bottle on his desk and washed them down with cold coffee . " I mean , this could be worse than that Cuban raft-boy thing . " Max wiped his hands on his slacks . " Look , I 'm sorry , it wasan accident . I already told you , Miguel knocked my latte overonto my lap in the dressing room while he was doing mymakeup . What was I supposed to do , wear soaking wet boxers ? C'm on , man , I had less than four minutes before I had to go onair , I had no choice . " Howard straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miguel 's underwear , " he said angrily . " Miguel is Hispanic . He does n't wear underwear . Besides , that 's a disgusting thought , even if he did . " " Not as disgusting as showing your dick to families all acrossAmerica while they 're sitting down to eat dinner . " Max rolled his eyes . " Jesus , Howard , you make it sound likeI did it on purpose . Like I 'm some kind of exhibitionist orsomething . " Howard leaned back in his chair , sighed , and looked up atthe ceiling . There was a silence between them , and Maxglanced over at the executive golf-putting toy in the corner ofthe office . Howard leaned forward and placed both hands onthe desk , palms up , like he had nothing left to offer . " Max , I'mvery sorry this had to happen , but if I put you back on air , I'lllose my job , the station will be boycottedas it is , you 're justlucky your penis did n't make the cover of USA Today . " Max leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? You'resaying , what , that I 'm fired ? Is that what you 're telling me ? " Howard nodded his head solemnly . " Yes , Max , I 'm afraidwe 're going to have to let you go . There 's no way we can let youback on the air after this , just no way . " Max 's hands flew up . " I ca n't believe you 're firing me overthis . " " I 'm sorry , Max , I really am . I 've got a few friends over atQVC and the Home Shopping Network , I could give them acall , see if they 're looking for anybody . But you might have tostart off doing the overnight . And if worse comes to worst , there 's always " he shifted his gaze toward one of the televisionmonitors that was currently displaying an electric egg scrambler " theE-Z Shop Channel .

" " Oh , well , gee , I guess I should take that as a compliment , " Max said sarcastically . " It 's not funny , Maxwell . It 's sad , is what it is . It 's very sadthat you were so careless . You 're a good host . But you crossed aline and , well , there are consequences . " Max left the office , mortified as security personnel accompaniedhim while he collected the possessions in his office , andthen escorted him out of the building like a sex offender . Peggy Jean Smythe sat in her office , reading an E-mail aviewer had sent her . Because of her high-profile time slots asa Sellevision host , she received dozens of E-mails each day . Shenormally responded with a standard forwarded thank-you letter.But if an E-mail was particularly flattering she would sometimesrespond personally with one or two lines . The reason viewers loved Peggy Jean was because theycould relate to her . She often spoke of her three boys , " four ifyou count my hubby . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who often hosted Jewelry of Faith programs , which featured crucifix cufflinks and Star of David money clips , both of which she presented with equal pride . She was attractiveblondhair worn in a short but full style , blue eyes , fairskin . Her roundish face seemed approachable and trustworthy.She was highly polished , yet friendly and accessible . Peggy Jeanknew all of this to be true , because she had seen the consumerresearch . In fact , she had personally attended many of the focusgroups . " Peggy Jean , did you hear ? About Max , I mean ? " Amandaasked , standing in Peggy Jean 's doorway . Peggy Jean turned dramatically in her chair to face theyoung woman . " Of course I heard , and I think it 's exactly theright thing to do . " " You do n't think it 's a little too severe ? I mean , just droppinghim like that ? " asked the associate producer . Peggy Jean smiled the exact smile she often wore for viewerswhile hosting a vacuum-cleaner showcase or one of themonthly Easy Wear 18K Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , of course I 'm sorry for Max , as I would befor any human being facing an adverse situation . But when Godcloses a door , Amanda , He opens a window . " Peggy Jean lookedup at the suspended ceiling . " He must have other plans in storefor our Max . " Then the smile was gone . " And now , Amanda , ifyou do n't mind ... I have an awful lot to do . " Amanda shrugged . " Sure , I understand . I did n't mean to disturbyou . " Peggy Jean returned her attention to the computer screen , listening to make sure Amanda actually had left . Then , almostbiting the tip of her manicure , but stopping herself , Peggy Jeanread the alarming E-mail for the third time : To : **26;119;TOOLONG : **26;147;TOOLONG : Hi There ! ! Hi Peggy Jean ! How exciting to be able to write you ! I am a loyal Sellevision fanand have ordered everything from Crock Pots to jewelry . I am sopleased with the quality of the countless items I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up when I hear your voice onSellevision . You are my favorite host . You are so professional andfriendly , and I just love your hair ! ! Speaking of hair , I just want to tell you this , woman to woman:Peggy Jean , I have noticed many times in close-up pictures howvery hairy your earlobes are . When I first noticed , it was a bit of ashock to see a beautiful earring on your ear , surrounded by all thosehairs , which on my large-screen TV were each almost the size of aVienna sausage ! ! I wonder if you have considered using the Lady Songbird WaxingHair Removal System that I have seen on Sellevision . It seemsa painless , quick and easy way for you to be even more beautifulthan you already are . I bumped into ( really ! ! ) my friend Susan at the supermarket andwe got to talking , you know , just catch-up stuff . Anyway , I mentionedSellevision for some reason , I forget why . And before long , we were talking about the show and our favorite hosts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! Is n't that a hoot ! ( LOL ) She said , " She 's a very hairy lady . " We both had a goodchuckle out of it , but PLEASE understand it was n't a chuckle ATyou personally . Well , I 've talked on and on , so I 'll stop here . May God bless youand your family . And you have my very best wishes . Your friend , Zoe : ) Peggy Jean pulled a small key from the inside pocket of herfuchsia DKNY blazer and unlocked the file cabinet beneath herdesk . The drawer contained emergency nylons , a spare pair ofsimple black pumps , a few sets of earrings that could easilycoordinate with most any outfit , and her purse . She pulled outher purse and removed her compact , peering into the smallmirror , angling her head as much to the side as she could . Shedid n't see any hairs . But then , this was a small mirror , held at adistance . It certainly was n't a macro shot from Camera One . If there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatwere so obvious on camera as to be the subject of a fan 's E-mail , Peggy Jean knew she would have to have them removed beforegoing on air at four P.M. Yet , whom could she ask ? If she did , infact , have the hairs , whomever she asked would surely gossipmentionto somebody else , " Peggy Jean has hairy earlobes " andword could easily spread all the way to her executiveproducer , Howard . The idea of being called into the refined , forty-five-year-old 's office and being verbally confronted aboutthe earlobe hairs , having to explain that the situation had beenremediedwell , it was just unthinkable . Peggy Jean remembered there was a large magnifying mirrorin makeup , and that it was illuminated by a ring of small , round bulbs . Surely makeup would be empty now , between thehosts ' shift change . Instinctively , she reached for the tube ofLancme moisturizer on her desk and squeezed a dime-sizeddollop onto the back of her hand . Then she quickly rubbed herhands together until they were soft and fragrant . Feminine . She placed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andpocketed the key . Leaving her office , she turned left and continueddown the hall , passing Trish Mission along the way . " Peggy Jean , you look wonderful , I love that jacket , " Trishsaid , gently taking the cuff of the blazer between her thumb andforefinger , admiring the softness of the fabric . " Well , thank you , I 'm glad you like it . This is the first timeI 've worn it in public . Took a little field trip to New York lastSaturday with the hubby , and picked this up at Bloomingdale 's . " Trish gave Peggy Jean a friendly nod . " Well , the color is justwonderful on you , it looks great with your eyes . " And with that , Trish wished Peggy Jean good luck on that afternoon 's GemFest and continued down the hall . Was it Peggy Jean 's imagination , or had Trish taken a quicklook at her earlobes ? Trish was one of the " emerging " hosts of Sellevision . Hergrowing popularity was propelling her from the overnight slotwhere new hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she currentlyoccupied that , although varying , included the occasional primetimeappearance , most notably her recent trip to Londonwhere she hosted a British Bonanza . How soon before the aging ( thirty-eightish ) hostess with apossible superfluous hair condition was replaced by the muchyounger , more beautiful , and fully waxed Trish Mission ? Therewas a prized-racehorse quality about Trish that unsettled PeggyJean . Tall , blond , and ambitious , Trish seemed to be growingmore and more successful out of sheer entitlement . Makeup was , thankfully , empty . Peggy Jean walked directlyover to the small round mirror that sat on one of the dressingtables . She pressed a button on the side that caused the bulbs toflicker momentarily , then illuminate . She peered at her reflection , moving her ear as close to the mirror as possible , using thegleaming Frosted Cappuccino-painted nail of her index fingerto move the lobe into the light . There they were : tiny hairs , faint and almost unnoticeable unless one were actively looking for them in an illuminated magnifying mirror , as she was doingat that moment . Amanda , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching Peggy Jean examine her ear . " Peggy Jean ? " she asked , concerned . " Is something the matter with your ear ? " * * * Heading west on I-92 , Max drove mostly in the passing lane , averaging a speed of seventy miles per hour . His favoriteCDthe original cast recording of Rentsat unplayed in hisfive-CD changer . " Stupid , stupid , fuck , fuck , " was the mantrahe repeated aloud to himself as he headed toward the WoodlandsMall to see if he could obtain a certain Beanie Babynamed Peanuts for his almost-seven-year-old niece . As much asthe Woodlands Mall was the exact last place Max wanted to be(Jake 's Joint , a bar , being the first ) , he simply had no choice . Hisniece 's birthday was the day after tomorrow and he had beenunsuccessful locating the elusive plush toy on the Internet.Now he was forced to shop the old-fashioned way : in person . Don , the Good Morning Show host and father of a fourteen-year-oldgirl , had told Max that the Toys R Us at the WoodlandsMall had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he had said to Max , " would be your best betand I 'm sayingthis as the father of a girl who would n't speak to me for a fullweek after I gave her Snort the Bull with that little red tag cutoff . " After wishing Max good luck in his search , Don hadwarned " Oh , and whatever you dodo n't cut that stupid littletag off . It 's all about the tag . " WOODLANDS MALL , NEXT EXIT , read the sign . " To think , unemployed ... me ? " Max said to the windshield . As he crossedover into the far-right lane , he resisted the temptation to aimthe steering wheel into the cement guardrail , causing his top-heavyFord Explorer to careen over the embankment , explodeinto flames , and kill him instantly . Instead , he decelerated downthe exit ramp and wondered , What if I 'm reduced to doing trafficreports ? On radio ? At four in the afternoon on a Wednesday , the Toys R Us wasthankfully empty . Cold , electronic renditions of children'ssongs played over the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Old McDonald Had a Farm , " even , oddly , " Kumbayah . " Every few minutes , the Muzak was replaced with a loud chorusof children singing the haunting Toys R Us advertising jingle , " I do n't want to grow up , I 'm a Toys R Us Kid ... " The store , asvast as a warehouse , was piled to the ceilings with urinatingdolls , bikes , puzzles , Lego sets , action figures , colorful balls , teddy bears implanted with microchips that enabled them toshake hands , Just Like Mommy cell phones , board games , plasticmachine guns , two-pound bags of M &Ms,; and inflatablepool creatures . Max stalked the aisles , looking for the BeanieBabies , never more thankful for his homosexuality and thechild-free life that went along with it . At the rear of the store , Max saw a huge display of BeanieBabies . Hundreds , maybe thousands , maybe millions of BeanieBabies to chose from . And all Max had to go on was a name:Peanut . No description , nothing . To locate Peanut , Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag . Unless he asked the little girl who was standing at theBeanie Baby display along with her mother . Who better to askthan a child ? " Excuse me , " Max said , approaching the little girl and hermother . The little girl spun around to look at the stranger talking to her . " I bet you can help me . I 'm looking for a particularBeanie Baby named " The little girl 's scream could be heard throughout the store , possibly the state . It was the sound of raw terror , as if Max werea ragged , scotch-stained Barney holding a machete . " It 's him , Mommy , it 's him , it 's the pee-pee man from last night , make himgo away , make him go away , " she cried , clinging to her motherand burying her face in the fabric of her mother 's skirt . " It 's okay , sweetie , it 's okay , " the mother reassured . Then toMax , " I 'm terribly sorry , she 's not herself todayMadelinesaw " she whispered " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really upset her . " Max stood dumbfounded , the shrillness of the little girl 's crystabbing his eardrums . The little girl continued to sob into her mother 's skirt . " It'shim , Mommy , it 's him . " The mother examined Max moreclosely and a glint of recognition entered her eyes . She pointedat Max . " Oh my God , that really was you ! You 're Max Andrewsfrom Sellevision ! That was your penis ! " A store detective appeared before the three of them . " Issomething the matter here ? " he asked . " I 'm in charge of security . " The little girl turned to the uniformed authority figure , andasked in awe , " Are you a policeman ? " The detective looked kindly at the girl , " No , honey . Well , sort of , I guess . I 'm the police officer of the store , I suppose youcould say . " The little girl pointed at Max , then burst into tears again . " He 's a bad man , make him go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thingie . " The detective immediately turned to Max and glared . The mother tried to calm her little girl by bending downand stroking her head , repeating , " It 's okay , sweetie , there'snothing to be afraid of , it 's okay . " The detective gripped Max 's elbow firmly . " You are in bigtrouble , mister . " " Hi , and welcome to Sellevision . I 'm your host , Peggy JeanSmythe , and you 're watching Gem Fest . " A small listeningdevice , discreetly tucked into her left ear and hidden by herhair , allowed Peggy Jean 's producer to communicate to herfrom Control Room 2 on the other side of the building . On thefloor in front of Peggy Jean were two large color monitors . Onewas a live-feed , displaying the exact scene that the rest of Americawas watching . The other monitor displayed the next scene , be it a long shot of the set , a close-up of the model who sat in achair off to the side , Peggy Jean herself , or simply a prerecorded " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At alltimes , there was a colored box on the left-hand side of thescreen that contained the name of the item , the item number , and the price , along with the Sellevision telephone number.The color of the box varied and could be coordinated with thetheme of the show . It could be yellow for the Good MorningShow , pink for a Hosiery Showcase , or blue for a Gem Fest.During the JFK Jr . Memorial Collection , the box was black.The Sellevision logo was always on the lower right-hand side ofthe screen , and never left . At that moment , Peggy Jean was looking at the live-feedmonitor , a medium shot of herself sitting behind a glossy , tan-and-blackwooden table . Behind her was what appeared to bethe evening skyline of an anonymous city . The windows of the " buildings " were illuminated and there was even a small , roundmoon in the sky , along with a smattering of stars . Very urbanand upscale . The naked Barbie doll a key-grip had placed in oneof the windows went entirely unnoticed by the viewing public . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kitchen set was like acharming farmhouse kitchen , with a delightful view of treesthat could be seen through the window above the sink . Thetrees looked extraordinarily real , especially in the winter whenthe branches were covered with artificial snow by prop stylists.There was a bedroom set complete with dormer windows andwainscoting . And the living-room set had a working stonefireplace as well as an overstuffed sofa , comfortable chairs , and accent tableseverything a tasteful , upper-middle-classliving room might include , even a bookcase filled with color-coordinatedantique books . Sellevision was far superior to theother home-shopping networks and Peggy Jean felt proud tobe a part of it . " If you love amethyst , or maybe your birthday is in February , amethyst being the February birthstone , or you just lovethe comfort of lever-back earrings and the color purple and youare a woman who appreciates a real stone presence , my first itemjust might be for you . " The producers in the control room cut to a prerecordedbeauty shot of the trillion-cut amethyst lever-back earrings . Then they cut back to Peggy Jean who was smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black velvetstand before her . " This is item number J-0415 and they are ourtrillion-cut amethyst lever-back earrings , priced at a veryaffordable forty-nine ninety-five . I just want to give you ameasurement here , " Peggy Jean said while she continued tosmile broadly , placing the ruler against one of the gemstoneearrings . Cut to a macro shot , Camera One . On the monitor , PeggyJean 's fingers were each larger than a loaf of Wonder Bread asshe positioned the ruler , displaying for the viewers at homethat , " This is gon na measure about , well , a little more thaneight-sixteenths of an inch across , and ... " She measured thevertical. " ... about one inch from top to bottom . " Her manicurewas absolutely flawless . In her ear , Peggy Jean heard her producer saying , " Peggy , these sold out the last time they were presented which wason ... lemme see here , okay , back in October . " Cut to medium shot of Peggy Jean . " Now , I just want to letyou know , these earrings did sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back in October . So it 's taken us agood seven months to get them back in stock . " Peggy Jeanlooked deep into the camera . " Keep in mind , the reason for thisis because people actually have to go out and find the amethystin nature , so that 's something to consider . " Gently tapping thestone with the tip of her nail , she informed the viewers , " Theseare absolutely beautiful earrings and they have a total gemweight of just over three carats , so that 's about one and a halfcarats per ear . And that 's a lot of stone . " " Peggy , the rings are already moving , this could be a sellout , so push hard . " " Let me just tell you , these earrings are extremely populartonight .
