According to city ordinance , the Buena Gente cantina should have been closed an hour ago . But the proprietress , a charitable soul whose life imitated the generosity of the earth , who believed in the rights of the people , and who did n't mind defying a silly law in the name of good business , stayed open late because Santiago de Noriaga Canek was celebrating the birth of his first child . Earlier that day the good Lord had blessed Santiago and his diminutive wife , Florcita , with a healthy baby girl they named Esperanza . Now it 's true that Santiago did not attend the delivery . Squeamish and superstitious , he regarded the whole ordeal of pregnancy and childbirth as a divine , messy marvel and believed a nauseous father would curse the baby 's health . However , once the miracle had taken place , he spent the entire day with his wife and newborn , until the sun set behind Fuego and Acatenango . Then , with his wife 's sincere blessing , he went to meet some friends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that his little girl had been born during Holy Week , on Holy Thursday , when His Savior sat at the table with the Apostles , amounted to nothing less than a heavenly invitation to get together with his friends and drink some beer . <p> It was now nearly eleven o'clock . A marimba played over an old stereo system , and the men were merrily drunk . Some danced , but Santiago de Noriaga Canek sat at a table cluttered with empty bottles of beer . A small , muscular man who worked as a gardener and whose ability to drink and maintain a good nature belied his Mayan ancestry , he appeared the picture of contentment , with glossy eyes and a wide smile that revealed teeth capped with gold . But now the time bad come to go . When he stood to make a final salutation , the dancing men stopped to listen . " Compaeros , " Santiago began , pulling a half-smoked Honduran cigar from his mouth . " I do n't deserve this humble life . And I am grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruit of my seed . Salud ! " He drank down what remained of his beer , dropped the cigar , extinguishing it underfoot , bid his friends goodnight , and set off to walk across town to the public clinic where his wile and daughter waited . <p> Outside the cantinas , Holy Week celebrations were well underway . Santiago stepped into a night of singing , shooting stars , as wondrous as the happiness in his heart . The town was packed with pilgrims and tourists who crowded the narrow sidewalks , gossiping and gawking in the open storefronts . Joyously inebriated , Santiago made his way through the throng until he took an awkward step into the street , where a bus nearly ran over him , blowing its horn as if he were a stray dog . No matter , though . Death and disrespect could n't stilly his soaring spirit , and he jumped back to the sidewalk , smiling like the moon . Nevertheless , he turned right at the intersection and walked down a street that was closed to traffic so that devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of dyed sawdust , flower petals , pine needles , and palm fronds laid down in the cobbled streets . At six o'clock the next morning a procession of Roman soldiers , of purple-robed penitents and a ten-thousand-pound statue of Christ carrying the cross , of sorrowful music and the weeping Virgin , would parade with solemn spectacle through the streets , destroying the carpets , a great honor for those who worked all night creating them . <p> Santiago sauntered past the hardware store , owned by Don Chepe Morales and his seven sons . A frequent employer of his gardening services , Don Chepe recently hired Santiago to procure for him two bundles of bougainvillea , both red and white , a sack of white begonia petals , several large sacks of lavender morning glories , a box of delicate pink orchids from the wet highlands , and a crate of white pine needle clusters , all to be used in Don Chepe 's procession carpet , which adorned thirty feet of street in front of the hardware store and was widely regarded each year as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Chepe and three of his sons worked on their creation , a resplendent Quetzal bird rising out of a flowering Sacred Heart . " Once again , sir , " the young Indian called out , " yours is as beautiful as the garden of God . " <p> Don Chepe kneeled on a plank supported a few inches above a bed of dyed sawdust on which he carefully arranged an assortment of flower petals . He turned his head but remained on his knees . " Well , good evening , Santiago , " he said , looking up . " You 're very kind . But this would n't have been possible without your help . By the way , how 's your wife coming along ? " <p> " She 's a mother now , sir , " Santiago answered . " My seed is a flower . A little girl we named Esperanza . I 'm on my way to the clinic now , as sure as the sun rises . " <p> " Well , congratulations , young man . May you and your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " Santiago said , continuing on his way . He walked slowly , feet light on the cobblestones , head in the sky , thoughts of his lovely wife and little girl circling around him like a wreath of doves . As he neared the end of the block he heard what sounded like a boisterous game taking place inside the Pollo Frito restaurant . A glance through the open windows revealed men guzzling liters of been spilling on their shirts as much as they managed to consume . The sight induced a sudden pressure in Santiago 's bladder , an unmistakable , undeniable sensation well known to those tanked up on volumes of beverage . He had to pee , and what better place to do so , he thought , than the crumbled exterior of San Augustine , a veritable latrine just one block away , permanently damp and smelly , where every man in town had as a matter of rite relieved himself . So Santiago hurried to the end of the next block , unzipped his navy trousers , and made water on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around the corner , a half block away , stuck in detoured traffic , Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro cursed from the back seat of her black BMW sedan . " Ca n't you go any faster , you idiot ! " she shouted at her driver . " Use the horn ! Do n't these people know who I am ! " <p> Wife of Carlos Alvadaro , one of the country 's wealthiest landowners , Doa Regina was a vain and petulant woman . At the moment , she had a headache , having spent the evening at a gathering of haughty , evangelical socialites . But the night had turned tiresome  --  Jesus is worth only so much money  --  and all she wanted now was to get home and soak in her opulent Turkish bath , attended by her staff of servile Indian women who messaged her selfish body with perfumed water and exotic Amazonian oils . But this bothersome traffic ! She hated Holy Week , despised the peas ants and foreigners who besieged the town . And the carpets , papist creations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major inconvenience , making it practically impossible for her to get where she wanted to go . " Oh , this is absolutely intolerable , " she grumbled . " What a mess ! Turn right ! Turn right at the church , you idiot ! " <p> Pissing blissfully , Santiago did n't pay any attention to the approaching luxury car . As the splashing torrent of urine drained from his body , he experienced a warm , rushing feeling of relief , and this pleasure , coupled with the delight of the day 's events , moved him to tears . <p> There were no tears of joy in Doa Regina 's eyes , however , only flames of fury as her car rounded the corner , and she saw through the tinted window what she considered an outrageous and despicable act of public insolence . " Stop the car ! " she barked , then lowered the window and screamed , " You disrespectful rogue . Do n't you know who I am ? " Then Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro ordered her driver , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Arrest him ! " she demanded . " Arrest him right now , you idiot ! " <p> Santiago de Noriaga Canek did n't understand what was happening . He had n't finished his business and did n't have time to zip up his pants before the driver , a burly mestizo of German descent , grabbed him from behind , wrenched his arm high around his back , and forced him into the street . " Why ? Why ? What did I do ? " Santiago wailed . <p> " Quiet him ! " Doa Regina commanded . <p> The driver took a handkerchief from his pocket and shoved it in Santiago 's mouth . " Shut up , you worthless piece of Indian shit , " he said , hitting the poor gardener hard across the side of the head . Then he pushed Santiago , a much smaller man , into the trunk and slammed it shut . <p> Before the BMW came to a complete stop , Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro , five feet three inches and one hundred and thirty-five pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the municipal jail . The cosmetic tan she wore could n't conceal the inflamed veins in her neck , and her heaving breasts nearly popped out of her designer dress . Right behind the seething shrew , the driver hustled Santiago in by the arm , twisted up tight against his back . " Sober up this wretch , " Doa Regina demanded , stomping high heels . <p> The jailer on duty , a young recruit who idly smoked a cigarette , was intimidated by the woman whose reputation preceded her . However , he was about to ask what the man had done when Doa Regina stepped dose to him and , in the soft but assertive voice of a sly courtesan , explained that the prisoner had not only grossly debased her respected name , but that he had practically attacked her with the hose hanging out of his pants and its filthy spray . This was a perverse and seditious act , she insisted , and implored the boyish jailer to detain the dirty lowlife who had offended the decency of the republic . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipples like hard candies pushing out of her tight brassiere . " I saw the man 's penis , " she purred , then added , dramatically , " . and it was a monster . Now put him behind bars until you hear from me . Do you understand , muchacho ? " <p> " Yes , seora . " <p> " Good . Now take me home , " she said to the driver , who obediently followed her out to the car , leaving a bruised and bewildered Santiago slumped against the wall . The jailer , who carried a rifle over his shoulder , swung the gun around and stuck the barrel into Santiago 's back . " Let 's go , " he said , pushing the prisoner down a dimly lit hall to a dark , stone cell . Then he crashed the butt of the gun into Santiago 's knee , causing him to collapse to the cold floor . The jailer locked the cell door , and Santiago de Noriaga Canek crawled to a thin straw mat , curled up , and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until he finally wept himself to sleep . <p> At five-thirty in the morning , the Chief of Police , a renegade among men of authority , arrived at the jail , where he found the guard asleep at his post . Rather than wake the slumbering sentry right then , the Chief made a routine inspection of the cells . At the end of the hall , in cell number 9 , he saw Santiago de Noriaga Canek huddled on the floor like a heap of rags . The Chief returned to the guard 's station and checked the night log , but could n't find any information about the man in cell number 9 . Then he pulled his service revolver from its holster and put the gun to the indolent jailer 's head , which rested on the desk . " Wake up , asshole , before I put a hole in that empty head of yours , " he said . <p> The jailer opened his eyes , wide as a cat in the dark , but did n't move . " Please do n't shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't waste the bullet , " the Chief said , holstering his gun . " Who 's the man in number 9 ? " <p> " A drunk Indian , " the guard answered , lighting a cigarette . <p> " Your father was a drunk Indian , " the Chief retorted . " And my father might have been , but he had pride . That 's the problem with this country . The rich people have taken the poor people 's pride . And then assholes like you go around thinking you 're better than a drunk Indian . Well , you 're not . You just get to carry a gun . Understand ? " <p> " Yes , Jefe . " <p> " What 's he in for ? " the Chief inquired . <p> " Public urination . " <p> " Public urination ? For God 's sake , it 's Holy Week . Which one of you fools brought him in ? " <p> " Not us , Jefe , " the guard replied quickly . " Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief . As tar as he was concerned , Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro was a threat to the nation 's uneasy democracy . He remembered Regina Ortega when she was an ordinary ladina schoolgirl who worked in her mother 's laundry on calle 5 . But now , thirty years later , she epitomized the pretensions of a class of people who cared less about their past  --  or anyone else 's future  --  than securing their arrogant place in the present , regardless of the law or the constitution . And her husband , the Chief knew him as well , since they had attended the same military school together in the capital . Unlike the Chief , however , Carlos Alvadaro , weak and ineffectual , showed no promise as a soldier . Of course , much to the Chief 's indignation , this meant little in regard to their respective class standings . Carlos Alvadaro was a wealthy young man whose place in society was guaranteed , and the Chief resented this the way the working-class typically resents the privileges of the rich . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry . Now , many years later , he was frustrated by the unjust system he had sworn to uphold and protect . <p> " That insufferable whore , " the Chief muttered , turning away from the guard . " I 'll show her who 's the law around here . " Then , with the resolution of a righteous man , he marched down the hall to cell 9 , where Santiago de Noriaga Canek slept on the floor , seemingly dead but alive in his dreams . The Chief entered the cell and gently kicked Santiago with his boot . " Get up , man , " he said . Roused but wary , Santiago cowered on the floor like an abused animal until file Chief prodded him with reassuring words . " Relax , man . Today is your lucky day . Do you know what day it is today ? " <p> Santiago struggled to his feet , uncertain what to think . " Good Friday ? " he offered , looking down . <p> " Ah , a Catholic . I thought so . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that so ? " Then the Chief led Santiago out of the cell . " Tell me , " he began , putting his hand on the gardener 's shoulder . " Have you ever participated in the Good Friday procession ? " <p> The Chief had n't come to the jail at five-thirty in the morning just to check on things . Each year on Good Friday he was entrusted to select an inmate to be released to play the role of Barabbas , the robber , one of the Passion characters featured in the procession . Whoever he chose would carry a cross for six hours , then go free . This year , as far as the Chief was concerned , the only appropriate and just choice was Santiago de Noriaga Canek . Given the contemptuousness of the woman responsible for his unreasonable incarceration , the Chief could n't come to any other conclusion . <p> So he explained to Santiago the conditions of his impending release as he escorted him from the jail to the Escuela de Cristo church , where the procession was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ill-tempered woman who had him detained the night before . " That woman , " the Chief said plainly , " she 's a stuck-up , stubborn , spiteful hen ! " <p> Two hours later , Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro was trying to get out of town . She was on her way to the coast , where she retreated every year during Holy Week to escape the crowds and the Catholicism , but the Good Friday procession was underway , and once again she was stuck in traffic . This time , however , she shared the road with vendors pushing carts , bicyclists , and animals inclined to immodest displays of defecation . " I ca n't believe this , " she fussed in the back seat . " I knew we should have left yesterday . This is ridiculous . Hurry up , you idiot , and get me out of here , " she said to her driver . <p> A block away , the procession , with its hundreds of participants , moved ceremoniously through the narrow street like theater on parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mounted centurions , and Pontius Pilate . An army of self-flagellating sinners led the way for a cast of wooden saints carried high on flowered catafalques . A band played mournful funereal marches . But the pice de rsistance was the ten-thousand-pound statue of Christ carrying the cross . Eighty men in purple robes labored to bear the sixteenth-century float on their shoulders , each staggering under its incredible weight . <p> " Fools , " Doa Regina hissed , looking out the window . Disgusted , she started to turn her head when from the corner of her eye something caught her attention . " Pull over ! " she ordered , lowering the window . It was difficult to see through the hundreds of people who lined the procession route , through the clouds of incense and all the holiday commotion , but she squinted intently and looked closer . Then in a sudden eruption of rage she threw open the car door , jumped out , and stormed across the street , screaming : " Over nay dead body ! Over nay dead body , you disrespectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block away , Santiago de Noriaga Canek , wearing the purple robe of his part , saw the woman coming . He recognized her immediately , flashing back to a bad dream , and thought , Oh Lord , as he instinctively turned to run . However , the heavy cross he carried hindered his escape , so he gave it to a gringo tourist , who did n't know what to think , and fled . Dodging Roman soldiers , sidestepping standard bearers , weaving in and out of a long line of robed brethren , Santiago ran toward the end of the procession . When he reached the ten-thousand-pound statue of Christ , he slipped in at the corner and joined the men shouldering the prodigious load . <p> Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro pursued close behind , pushing her way through townspeople and tourists . " Stop that man , " she shouted . " Stop him ! Do n't you people know who I am ! " Gaining ground quickly , she now plowed through the procession until she was only a few feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless wretch , " she bellowed . " Stop right now ! I demand you to stop right now ! " <p> Santiago heard her , but the Son of God rode on his shoulder , and he was unable to flee . As easily as he had joined the men carrying the great statue , he had assumed equal part of the burden . He was now synchronized with the rhythm of their choreographed steps  --  two forward , one to the side , one back , two more forward  --  intended to mimic Christ 's struggling pace as he went to his crucifixion . So extraordinary was the effort , Santiago walked as if in a trance , matching strides with the men in front and back . <p> Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro , on the other hand , determined to impose her will on the innocents of the world , shoved her way beneath the statue and reached for Santiago 's collar . In doing so , she disrupted the measured marching step , causing some of the men to run into each other and trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous float lurching to the side . Although some of those who stumbled tried to recover , including Santiago de Noriaga Canek , others panicked under the shifting weight and abandoned their positions , scattering , until all hope was lost , and for the first time in five hundred years the ten-thousand-pound statue of Christ crashed to the ground . Miraculously , none of the men were hurt . Nor were any other procession participants or spectators harmed . In fact , the only casualty on that Good Friday was Doa Regina Ortega de Carlos Alvadaro , who is now remembered among townspeople as the woman crushed under the incredible weight of God . <p> <p> By Michael Huffman <p>
