A LITTLE LOVING CARE NOW WILL RESULT IN DOWNED DEER THIS FALL . RIFLE NEGLECT IS NOT LIMITED to the unlettered , the boorish , the sloppy , and the imbecilic . Larry Koller was probably the finest outdoorsman I 've ever known , but when he passed on it took a gunsmith three weeks to clean his firearms to salable condition . John Amber , founder and longtime editor of The Gun Digest , departed leaving many of his guns  --  some of them priceless and irreplaceable  --  rusting away in a barn . No , the tragedy of rifle neglect ( like dandruff or flatulence ) occurs in even the finest people . But that does n't make it right . Your rifle wants to be your friend and will perform faithfully for you . All it needs to succeed at this is some careful but cheap attention , outlined in these 10 steps . And when I say cheap , I mean cheap . The total cost of all the products mentioned here is less than $60. 1 SCRUB THE BARREL . No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  clean it so there 's nothing but bright steel inside . How ? Scrub away with powder solvent , patches , and a phosphor-bronze brush , and then polish all the little grooves and lands with J-B Non-Embedding Bore Compound . When you can no longer see copper streaks from the muzzle end , you 're done . COST : $4 2 FIX THE DINGS . Major dents in a wood-stocked rifle can often be raised by laying a damp cleaning patch over the depression and heating the cloth with the tip of a hot iron . The steam will work its way into the wood fibers , causing them to swell , and the dent will either diminish or vanish . COST : $0 3 HOSE DOWN THE ACTION . Get a can of Birchwood-Casey Gun Scrubber . Next , take your barreled action out of its stock and remove the scope . ( If you have a lever or pump or auto , remove the buttstock . ) Now , working outdoors and wearing safety glasses , spray down the action , and in the case of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing stuff will come out . Do not re-oil . I will say that again : Do not re-oil . COST : $6.80 4 REMOVE THE GOO . While the barreled action is out of the stock , wipe off all the accumulated goo that 's on the underside of the barrel and the receiver . Do this to the corresponding surfaces in the stock as well . Re-oil the metal surfaces you 've just cleaned . Lightly . I like to use Rem Oil , which is sold at just about all gun stores that are worthy of the name . COST : $2.50 5 INSPECT THE BASE . While the scope is off the rifle , make sure the base screws are tight . If you 're really conscientious , remove the bases and check for oil that 's seeped underneath . Wipe it off . Degrease all surfaces , including base screws and screw holes , and replace the bases . COST : $0 6 CLEAN YOUR SCOPE LENSES . Use camera-lens cleaner and lens tissue . You can get this at any photo-supply store . COST : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by scrubbing with 0000 steel wool and a little oil . ( A rusted trigger is more serious ; a gunsmith will have to take it apart and clean it or replace it . ) A package of 0000 steel wool , which you can get at a hardware store , lasts for years . My own dates back to the Truman administration . COST : $8 8 REBLUE WORN AREAS . Some shooters consider bright spots to be the equivalent of campaign ribbons . I do , to an extent . But they are more likely to rust than blued surfaces , so you may want to get rid of them with a bottle of Brownells 44/40 Instant Gun Blue . COST : $10 9 REPLACE BURRED SCREWS . The best way to get new ones is from a gunsmith . They buy spare screws by the bushel and can sell you the exact number and size you need . This includes not only ring and base screws but also bedding screws . COST : $6 10 UPGRADE TO TORX . Even if your slot- or hex-head base and ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screws . These rank among the great inventions of man because you can drive the suckers in tight and they are almost impossible to bugger up , even by the most ham-handed people . Base screws should be tightened until blood seeps from under your fingernails . Ring screws should be tightened firmly , not obsessively , because you may have to take your scope off in the field , where a screw that wo n't budge is the last thing you need . You can buy an assortment of Torx screws and have enough to upgrade several guns . COST : $12 BOX YOU CAN GET MOST OF THESE ITEMS AT GUN STORES , OR YOU CAN DO IT THE EASY WAY BY ORDERING THEM FROM BROWNELLS ( 800-741-0015 ; BROWNELLS.COM ) . YOUR RIFLE WILL THANK YOU .
