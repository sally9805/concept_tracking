Marla Blakney 's fifth-grade classroom is the front line in the nation 's largest experiment in privately run public schools . And on a muggy fall morning in Room 308 at Harrity Elementary School , the troops are doing the Macarena . Arms crossing , hips swiveling , 24 Philadelphia schoolchildren are shouting a mantra  --  " Wisdom ! Justice ! Courage ! ... "  --  that is supposed to create the lively but respectful classroom environment that can elude even good teachers . And to their skeptical teacher 's amusement , it seems to be working . " When Edison taught us this , I thought , ' This is so corny . My kids wo n't go for it , ' " says Blakney , whose building was taken over this fall by the for-profit company Edison Schools . " But it 's a new year . I 'm giving it a try . " <P> Like Blakney , other teachers as well as students and administrators in Philadelphia 's worst-performing elementary and middle schools have been forced to undertake some radical changes this year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city to seven independent operators . The outside contractors include Edison , based in New York City and the largest of the companies that manage public schools as a business ; Victory Schools , a much smaller New York City firm with schools in that city aswell as in Baltimore , Md. ; and the Chancellor Beacon Academies of Coconut Grove , Fla. , which operates charter schools and private day schools around the country . Two nonprofit organizations were also given schools to run , and both Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania will provide extensive services atothers . In addition , the panel hired Paul Vallas , who oversaw major reforms in Chicago 's schools , as its new district CEO . Butmosteyes , in Philadelphia and around the nation , are focused on the for-profit companies that ambitiously , and controversially , aim to improve failing public schools while rewarding private investors . <P> How well Philadelphia 's children fare in these real-life laboratories will ultimately touch public schools in every corner of the U.S. , offering examples to emulate or mistakes to avoid . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct stake in the outcome : fifth-grade teacher Blakney , elementary-school principal Anita Duke andseventh-grade student Shaliah Denmark . All three will experience what happens when private hands buy the books , train the teachers and set the priorities . Each has her own degree of optimism about the promised reforms . TIME will return to them later in the school year for a report card on how those changes  --  and their feelings about them  --  have progressed . <P> THE TEACHER
