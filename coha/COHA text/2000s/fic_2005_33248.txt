Chapter One Harper House July 2005 Tired down through the marrow , Hayley yawned until her jaw cracked . Lily 's head was heavy on her shoulder , but every time she stopped rocking , the baby would squirm and whimper , and those little fingers would clutch at the cotton tank Hayley was sleeping in . Trying to sleep in , Hayley corrected and murmured hushing noises as she sent the rocker creaking again . She knew it was somewhere in the vicinity of four in the morning , and she 'd already been up twice before to rock and soothe her fretful daughter . She 'd tried at about the two a.m. mark to snuggle the baby into bed with her so they 'd both get some sleep . But Lily would have nothing but the rocker . So Hayley rocked and dozed , rocked and yawned , and wondered if she 'd ever get eight straight again in this lifetime . She did n't know how people did it . Especially single mothers . How did they cope ? How did they stand up under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would she have managed it all if she 'd been completely on her own with Lily ? What kind of life would they have had if she had no one to help with the worry , the sheer drudgery , the fun and the foolishness ? It was terrifying to think of it . She 'd been so ridiculously optimistic and confident , and stupid , she thought now . Sailing along , she remembered , nearly six months pregnant , quitting her job , selling most of her things and packing up that rattletrap car to head out . God , if she 'd known then what she knew now , she 'd never have done it . So maybe it was good she had n't known . Because she was n't alone . Closing her eyes , she rested her cheek on Lily 's soft , dark hair . She had friends-no , family-people who cared about her and Lily and were willing to help . They did n't just have a roof over their heads , but the gorgeous roof of Harper House . She had Roz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd offered her a home , a job , a chance . She had Stella , her best friend in the world to talk to , bitch to , learn from . Both Roz and Stella had been single parents-and they 'd coped , she reminded herself . They 'd better than coped , and Stella had had two young boys to raise alone . Roz three . And here she was wondering how she 'd ever manage one , even with all the help only an offer away . There was David , running the house , cooking the meals . And just being wonderfully David . What if she had to cook every night after work ? What if she had to do all the shopping , the cleaning , the hauling , the everything in addition to holding up her end at her job and caring for a fourteen-month-old baby ? Thank God she did n't have to find out . There was Logan , Stella 's gorgeous new husband , who was willing to tinker around with her car when it acted up . And Stella 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to play with Lily but were giving Hayley a hint of the sort of things she had coming in the next few years . There was Mitch , so smart and sweet , who liked to scoop Lily up and cart her around on his shoulders while she laughed . He 'd be officially here all the time now , she thought , once he and Roz got back from their honeymoon . It had been so nice , so much fun , to watch both Stella and Roz fall in love . She 'd felt a part of it all-the excitement , the changes , the expansion of her new family circle . Of course , Roz 's marriage meant Hayley 'd have to stop dragging her feet on finding a place of her own . Newlyweds were entitled to privacy . She wished there was a place close by . Even on the estate . Like the carriage house . Harper 's house . She sighed a little as she rubbed a hand over Lily 's back . Harper Ashby . Rosalind Harper Ashby 's firstborn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think about him that way . Much . He was a friend , a co-worker , and her baby girl 's first crush . From all appearances , that love affair was mutual . She yawned again , lulled like the baby by the rhythm of the rocking and the early-morning quiet . Harper was , well , just flat-out amazing with Lily . Patient and funny , easy and loving . Secretly she thought of him as Lily 's surrogate father-without the benefits of smoochies with Lily 's mother . Sometimes she played pretend-and what was the harm in that ? - and the surrogate part of father did n't apply . The smoochies did . After all , what red-blooded American girl-currently very sex-deprived girl-would n't fantasize now and again about the tall , dark , and ridiculously handsome type , especially when he came with a killer grin , heart-melting brown eyes , and a pinchable butt ? Not that she 'd ever pinched it . But in theory . Plus he was completely smart . He knew everything there was to know about plants and flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house at In the Garden . The way his hands held a knife or tied raffia . He was teaching her , and she appreciated it . Appreciated it too much to indulge herself and take a nice hungry bite out of him . But imagining doing it did n't hurt a thing . She eased the rocker to a stop , held her breath and waited . Lily 's back continued to rise and fall steadily under her hand . Thank God . She got up slowly , moving toward the crib with the stealth and purpose of a woman making a prison break . With her arms aching , her head fuzzy with fatigue , she leaned over the crib and gently , inch by inch laid Lily on the mattress . Even as she draped the blanket over her , Lily began to stir . Her head popped up , and she began wailing . " Oh , Lily , please , come on , baby . " Hayley patted , rubbed , swaying on her feet . " Ssh now , come on . Give your mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as she kept her hand on Lily 's back , the little head stayed down . So Hayley sank to the floor , stuck her arm through the crib slats . And patted . And patted . And drifted off to sleep . * * * It was the singing that woke her . Her arm was asleep , and stayed that way when her eyes opened . The room was cold ; the section of the floor where she sat beside the crib a square of ice . Her arm prickled from shoulder to fingertip as she shifted to keep a protective hand on Lily 's back . The figure in the gray dress sat in the rocker , softly singing the old-fashioned lullaby . Her eyes met Hayley 's , but she continued to sing , continued to rock . The jolt of shock cleared the fuzziness from Hayley 's head , and had her heart taking one hard leap into her throat . Just what did you say to a ghost you had n't seen for several weeks ? she wondered . Hey , how are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially when the ghost in question was totally whacked ? Hayley 's skin was slicked with cold when she pushed slowly to her feet so she could stand between the rocker and the crib . Just in case . Because it felt as if a few thousand needles were lodged in her arm , she cradled it against her body , rubbing it briskly . Note all the details , she reminded herself . Mitch would want all the details . She looked pretty calm for a psychotic ghost , Hayley decided . Calm and sad , the way she had the first time Hayley had seen her . But she 'd also seen her with crazed , bulging eyes . " Um . She had to get some shots today . Inoculations . She 's always fussy the night after she gets them . But I think she 's settled down now . In time to get up again in a couple of hours , so she 'll probably be cranky for the babysitter until she gets her nap . But ... but she should sleep now , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the singing . * * * David fixed her blueberry pancakes for breakfast . She 'd told him not to cook for her or Lily while Roz and Mitch were gone , but he always did . Since he looked so cute fussing in the kitchen , she did n't try very hard to discourage him . Besides , the pancakes were awesome . " You 've been looking a little peaky . " David gave her cheek a pinch ; then repeated the gesture on Lily to make her giggle . " Have n't been sleeping much lately . Had a visitor last night . " She shook her head when his eyebrows rose , and his mouth curved into a leer . " Not a man-too sad for my bad luck . Amelia . " Amusement faded immediately , replaced by concern as he slid into the breakfast nook across from her . " Was there trouble ? Are you all right ? " " She was just sitting in the rocker , singing . And when I told her Lily was fine , that she could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe she 's settled down again . We can hope . Have you been worried about that ? " He took a careful study of her face , noted the smudges under the soft blue eyes , the pallor beneath the carefully applied blush on her cheeks . " Is that why you have n't been sleeping ? " " Some , I guess . Things were pretty wild around here for a few months . Our gooses were constantly getting bumped . Now this lull . It 's almost creepier . " " You 've got Daddy David right down here . " He reached over to pat her hand , his long , concert pianist 's fingers giving it a little extra rub . " And Roz and Mitch will be back today . The house wo n't feel so big and empty . " She let out a long breath , relieved . " You felt that way , too . I did n't want to say , did n't want you to feel like you were n't enough company or something . ' Cause you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we 've gotten spoiled , have n't we ? Had a houseful for a year around here . " He glanced toward the empty seats at the table . " I miss those kids . " " Aw , you softie . We still see them , everybody , all the time , but it 's weird , having everything so quiet . " As if she understood , Lily launched her sip-cup so that it slapped the center island and thudded on the floor . " Atta girl , " David told her . " And you know what else ? " Hayley rose to retrieve the cup . She was tall and lanky , and much to her disappointment , her breasts had reverted to their pre-pregnancy size . She thought of them as an A-minus cup . " I think I 'm getting in some sort of mood . I do n't mean rut , exactly , because I love working at the nursery , and I was just thinking last night-when Lily woke up for the millionth time-how lucky I am to be here , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She spread her arms , let them fall . " But , I do n't know , David , I feel sort of ... blah . " " Need shopping therapy . " She grinned and got a washcloth to wipe Lily 's syrupy face . " It is the number-one cure for almost everything . But I think I want a change . Something bigger than new shoes . " Deliberately , he widened his eyes , let his jaw go slack . " There 's something bigger ? " " I think I 'm going to cut my hair . Do you think I should cut my hair ? " " Hmm . " He cocked his head , studied her with his handsome blue eyes . " It 's gorgeous hair , that glossy mahogany . But I absolutely loved it the way you wore it when you first moved here . " " Really ? " " All those different lengths . Tousled , casual , kicky . Sexy . " " Well ... " She ran her hand down it . She 'd grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length to pull back for work or motherhood . And maybe that was just the problem . She 'd started taking the easy way because she 'd stopped finding the time or making the effort to worry about how she looked . She wiped Lily off , freed her from the high chair so she could wander around the kitchen . " Maybe I will then . Maybe . " " And toss in the new shoes , sweetie . They never fail . " In high summer business slowed at the garden center . It never trickled down too far at In the Garden , but in July , the heady late winter through spring rush was long over . Wet heat smothered west Tennessee , and only the most avid of gardeners would suffer through it to pump new life into their beds . Taking advantage of it , and her mood , Hayley wheedled a salon appointment , and an extra hour off from Stella . When she drove back into work after her extended lunch break , it was with a new do , two new pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David , she decided . She loved In the Garden . Most days , she did n't feel as if she was going to work at all . There could n't be a better quality in a job than that , in her opinion . She enjoyed just looking at the pretty white building that looked more like someone 's well-tended home than a business , with the seasonal beds spreading out from its porch , and the pots full of colorful blooms by its door . She liked the industry across the wide gravel lot-the stacks of peat and mulch , the pavers and landscape timbers . The greenhouses that were full of plants and promises , the storage buildings . When it was busy with customers , winding along the paths , pulling wagons or flatbeds full of plants and pots-everyone full of news or plans-it was more like a small village than a retail space . And she was a part of it all . She stepped in , and did a turn for Ruby , the white-haired clerk who manned the counter . " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sassy . " She ran her fingers through her short shaggy hair , then let it fall again . " I have n't done anything new with my hair in a year . More . I almost forgot what it was like to sit in a beauty parlor and have somebody do me . " " Things do slide with a new baby . How 's our best girl doing ? " " Fussy last night after her shots . But she bounced back this morning . My butt was dragging . Pumped now though . " To prove it , she flexed her arms to show little bumps of biceps . " Good thing . Stella wants everything watered , and I do mean everything . And we 're waiting on a big delivery of new planters . They 'll need to be stickered and shelved once they come in . " " I 'm your girl . " She started outside in the thick , drowsy heat , soaking the bedding plants , the annuals and perennials who 'd yet to find a home . They made her think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the team . As a result , she had a soft spot for them and wished she had a place where she could dig them into the soil , let them bloom , let them find their potential . One day she would have a place . She 'd plant gardens , take what she 'd learned here and put it to use . Make something beautiful , something special . There would have to be lilies , naturally . Red lilies , like the ones Harper brought to her when she was in labor with Lily . A big , splashy pool of red lilies , bold and fragrant that would come back year after year and remind her how lucky she was . Sweat trickled down the back of her neck , and water dampened her canvas skids . The gentle spray annoyed the gang of bees covering the sedum . So , come back when I 'm finished , she thought as they flew off with an annoyed buzz . We 're all after the same thing here . She moved slowly , half dreaming , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she had a garden , and there was Lily playing on the grass . With a puppy , she decided . There should be a puppy , all fat and soft and frisky . If she was able to have all that , could n't she add a man ? Someone who loved her and Lily , someone funny and smart who made her heart beat just a little faster when he looked at her ? He could be handsome . What was the point of a fantasy if the guy was n't great-looking ? Tall , he would be tall , with good shoulders and long legs . Brown eyes , deep delicious brown , and lots of thick dark hair she could get her hands into . Good cheekbones , the kind you just wanted to nibble your way along until you got to that strong , sexy mouth . And then- " Jesus , Hayley , you 're drowning that coreopsis . " She jerked , whipping the sprayer , then on a little yip of distress whipped it back again . But not before the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn between embarrassment and inappropriate giggles . He looked down at his soaked shirt , his jeans with a kind of grim resignation . " Got a license for that thing ? " " I 'm sorry ! I 'm so sorry . But you should n't sneak up behind me that way . " " I did n't sneak anywhere . I walked . " His voice was aggravated , but so Memphian , she thought , where she knew hers hit twang when she was excited or upset . " Well , walk louder next time . I really am sorry though . I guess my mind was wandering . " " This kind of heat , it 's easy for the mind to wander , then lie down to take a nap . " He pulled the wet shirt away from his belly . His eyes crinkled at the corners when he narrowed them . " What did you do to your hair ? " " What ? " Instinctively she reached up , pulled her fingers through it . " I had it cut . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's fine . " Her finger itched on the trigger of the sprayer . " Please , stop . That kind of flattery 'll just go to my head . " He smiled at her . He had such a great smile-sort of slow , so that it shifted the angles of his face and lit up in those deep , dark brown eyes-she nearly forgave him . " I 'm heading home , for a bit anyway . Mama 's back . " ( Continues ... )
