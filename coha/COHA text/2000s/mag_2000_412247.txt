Above : Daniel Fain , Nathan Fleming and Issac Yapuncich ( left to right ) rest after a windy climb to the " Hole in the Wall . // The summer sun blazed down . Northern Montana 's ferocious mosquitoes swarmed and stung . And a group of overheated Boy Scouts from Troops 1 and 7 of Great Falls , Mont , sat sweating in the dirt on a river island , their minds focused on a common question : Was this outing really such a good idea ? The five Scouts ' objective was to retrace part of the wilderness trail carved out nearly 200 years before by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark . Lewis and Clark made their celebrated two-year , 2,000-mile expedition from St. Louis to Oregon 's Pacific coast and back . The Scouts and their leaders were n't nearly so ambitious . They planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over five days . Right now , however , a raft and a cool drink in the backyard pool sounded a lot more inviting . Think This Is Tough ? Trekking west in the summer of 1805 , Lewis and Clark passed within miles of where the Montana Scouts in 1999 sat broiling and itching in the sun . The Scouts at least had insect repellent for protection . The early explorers made do with bear grease . Heading east for home in July 1806 , Captain Lewis and four men again traveled through the area , just south of the Canadian border . Besides the heat and bugs , the explorers contended with hunger , grizzly bears and hostile Indians , two of whom they killed in a skirmish . The Marias River , where the Scouts now sweltered , was named by Capt . Lewis for his cousin Maria . He called his last bivouac ( biv-wacky on the river Camp Disappointment . The Scouts already understood why . which low . After dinner , as everyone roasted marshmallows over a campfire , guide ( and Eagle Scout ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis and Clark 's journals . They learned how the explorers , their 26-man " Corps of Discovery " and their later-tobecome-famous Indian companion , Sacagawea , camped at the mouth of the Marias River for a week in June 1805 while trying to decide which fork of the river to follow upstream . Two centuries later , the only choice the Scouts faced was whether to split the next stretch of river into two easy days of paddling , or to do it all in one . After serious discussion , they agreed to go for it-a 26mile grunt that would bring them to the heart of the Missouri 's beautiful white cliffs region , which remains essentially unchanged from Lewis and Clark 's day . At sunup , they wolfed down breakfast and then loaded the canoes . Lewis and Clark had poled their way upriver in dugouts . The Scouts paddled five , 17-foot aluminum models downstream . Hats and life jackets were pulled on , sunscreen applied liberally . For safety , boats stayed within eyesight of one another . A Killer Paddle By noon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew stopped at the old ferry site of Virgelle , they 'd already covered a dozen miles . Everyone dived for the food bags . Then came 14 more tough miles on the river before making camp that evening . The groaning crew secured their canoes , set up their tents , then collapsed on the river bank for a nap . Matt awoke in time to guide several Scouts on a trip across the river . There , on a cliff hundreds of feet above their heads , was the Eye of the Needle , a natural sandstone arch that , sadly , vandals had broken the year before . Nevertheless , the climb was more than worth it . " his is sweet ! " Life Scout Dan Fain , Matt 's brother , said as he scrambled up a white sandstone gully . The view from the top was breathtaking-possibly the very same view Lewis and Clark had seen when they had camped nearby . But the captains probably had n't paid much attention to the sights . They had wondered if they 'd get across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a northwest passage to the ocean as they hoped . Not to mention the grizzlies . Matt told everyone how several members of the expedition were chased by a wounded grizzly bear . The men had jumped off a 20-foot cliff into the river to escape the bear . " I 'd jump into the river too if a grizzly was chasing me , " Dan said . " Not me , " disagreed Star Scout Nathan Fleming . " I 'd just lie there . " ( Nathan was right . Never try to run from a bear . Bears are faster . ) No Rest for the Weary That night , a breeze picked up . By dawn it had become a chilly , howling wind . The hot spell was over . But not the trip . After the previous day 's exertions , the Scouts had hoped for an easy paddle . No such luck . All day , the wind gusts slammed the canoes back and forth in the water . By evening , the crew was bushed again . Meantime , rain clouds were building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class Scout Issac Yapuncich , both 14 , cooked dinner than the storm struck and raged for 30 minutes .

The clouds vanished and a strong , steady wind came up , making the last full day of paddling , well , a breeze . Jeremy spotted some snaky-looking green matter in the river-filamentous green algae , it turned out-and flung a wet wad of the nasty stuff at 13-year-old First Class Scout David Dolphay in another canoe . Soon all the laughing Scouts slimed one another . Lewis and Clark never had it so good . Or did they ? IN THEIR OWN " WIRDS " Meriwether Lewis and William Clark kept careful diaries , creating a permanent ( if oddly spelled ) record of their extraordinary adventure . Here are some excerpts from " The Essential Lewis and Clark , " Landon Y. Jones , editor .

Above , right Jeremy Long slings soggy algae at David Dolphay. // In the evening we was a brown or grisley beare on a sand beech . I went out killed the bear , which was verry large and a turrible looking animal , which we found verry hard to kill . We shot 10 balls into him before those balls through his lights . This animal is the largest of the carnivorous kind I ever saw . We had nothing that could way him . I think his weight may be stated at 500 pounds . Clark , Dec. 1 , 1805 , on the Oregon coast : The emence seas and waves which breake on the rocks &; coasts to the S.W. &; N.W. roars like an emence fall at a distance , and this roaring has continued ever since our arrival in the neighbourhood of the sea coast which has been 24 days since we arrived in sight of the Great Western ( for I can not say Pacific ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arrival in its vicinity . Lewis July 11 , 1806 , on the Missouri River : Our horses had not been acquainted with the buffaloe , they appeared much allarmed at their appearance and bellowing . When I arrived in sight of the White-bear Islands the Missouri bottoms on both sides of the river were crouded with buffaloe . I sincerely beleif that there were not less than 10 thousand buffaloe within a circle of 2 miles arround that place . <p>
