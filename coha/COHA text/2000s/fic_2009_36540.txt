Beara Peninsula , Southwest Ireland 4:45 p.m. , IST August 25 <p> Lizzie Rush tensed at her table by the fire , watching out of the corner of her eye as a tall , fair-haired man entered the small village pub , shutting the door firmly against the gale-force wind and steady rain that had been lashing the southwest Irish coast for hours . The man wore an expensive trench coat unbuttoned over a dark brown sweater neatly draped across a flat abdomen , dark brown trousers and leather shoes that , although suited to walking the isolated hills of the remote Beara Peninsula , looked to be free of mud and manure . The half-dozen local fishermen and farmers Lizzie had seen arrive over the past hour had hung up wet , worn jackets and scraped off their shoes and wellies or shed them and set them by the door . The men were gathered now over pints of Guinness and mugs of coffee at rickety tables by the front window . They paid no attention to the newcomer , nor did the brown-and-white springer spaniel flopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog belonged to the barman and presumably was accustomed to the comings and goings at the pub . <p> Lizzie drank the last of her strong coffee . The past day had been a whirlwind . A last-minute overnight flight from Boston to Dublin . A few hours to check in to her family 's small hotel in Dublin and try to talk herself into abandoning her trip to the Beara Peninsula . No luck there . Then it was back to the airport for a short flight west across Ireland to the tiny Kerry County airport and , finally , the drive here , to this quiet village on Kenmare Bay , in the rain and wind . <p> She set down her mug and turned a page in the beautifully illustrated book of Irish folktales she was reading while enjoying coffee and warm blackberry crumble by the fire . As tempting as it was , she knew she could n't give in to the lure of the cozy , romantic atmosphere of the pub and let down her guard . As the newcomer walked over to the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun , a knife  --  concealed under his trench coat or tucked next to an ankle . <p> Or he could be an ordinary , if well-dressed , tourist getting out of the gale . <p> The barman , a wiry , sandy-haired Irishman named Eddie O'Shea , filled a pint from the tap . He 'd been eyeing Lizzie with a mix of suspicion and curiosity since she 'd shed her own dripping jacket and hung it on a wooden peg by the door , but he gave the newcomer a warmer reception . <p> " Ah , " he said with a smile and a little hoot of surprise and recognition , " if it is n't Lord Will himself . " <p> Lord Will . <p> Lizzie forced herself to calmly turn another page in her book . <p> " Hello , Eddie , " the newcomer said in an upper-class British accent . <p> Eddie set the pint on a tray on the gleaming , polished five-foot stretch of wood in front of him and sighed . " You would n't be in Ireland for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not today , I 'm afraid . " <p> Lizzie stared at a lush watercolor of a quaint Irish farm , grazing sheep and trooping fairies . Of all the things she 'd anticipated could go wrong on this trip , having William Arthur Davenport turn up in the same Irish village , the same Irish pub she was in , was n't one of them . <p> She let her gaze settle on the details of the captivating water-color  --  the pink-and-lavender sunrise above the green hills , the purple thistle along a country lane , the mischievous smiles of the fairies . The book was the work of Keira Sullivan , a Boston-based illustrator and folklorist with deep Irish roots . Lizzie had yet to meet Keira , but she knew Simon Cahill , the FBI agent with whom Keira was romantically involved . <p> Simon , Lizzie reminded herself , was the reason she was in Ireland . She 'd heard he was here with Keira on the Beara Peninsula while she painted and researched an old Irish story . As much as Lizzie hated to disturb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had to act now , before Norman Estabrook could make good on his threat to kill Simon and his boss , FBI director John March . <p> Norman would kill Lizzie , too , if he discovered the role she 'd played in the FBI investigation into his illegal activities over the past year , culminating in his arrest two months ago on suspicion of money laundering and providing material support to transnational drug traffickers . He was a thrill-seeking billionaire with a long reach . There was no doubt in her mind that he would never go to trial , much less end up in prison . For Norman Estabrook , death was preferable to confinement . He was under arrest now  --  he 'd given up his passport , posted a huge bond and agreed to stay on his Montana ranch under electronic surveillance . But it would n't last . There was talk he was about to cut a deal with federal prosecutors and walk . <p> And when that happened , Lizzie thought , he 'd come after the people he believed had betrayed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Her . <p> When she 'd finally decided to come to Ireland and talk to Simon face-to-face , Lizzie had created a cover story that would explain her presence on the Beara Peninsula without giving herself away . If not the truth , it was n't an outright lie , either . <p> She simply had n't counted on Simon 's handsome , dangerous British friend turning up in Ireland , too . She had no desire to pop onto Will Davenport 's radar . <p> Lizzie decided she would n't mind being a tiny fairy right now . Or a shape-shifter . Then she could turn herself into an ant . <p> An ant could disappear into a crack in the floor and not be noticed by the man at the bar . <p> She 'd done her research . Will Davenport was the younger son of a British peer , the marquess of something  --  she could n't remember his exact title . Peter , Will 's older brother , managed the family 's five-hundred-year-old estate in the north of England , and Arabella , his younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will was the wealthy owner of various properties in England and Scotland , with offices in an ivy-covered London brownstone . <p> That was n't all he did . Two years ago  --  supposedly  --  he had abruptly abandoned his career as an officer with the Special Air Service  --  the SAS  --  to make his fortune . Lizzie , however , strongly suspected he had merely shifted from the SAS to the SIS , the British Secret Intelligence Service , popularly known as MI6 . <p> She did know her spies . <p> Surreptitiously she tucked a few strands of black hair back under her red bandanna . She had n't tried to disguise herself so much as make it less easy for anyone to describe her later on . " Oh , yes , I saw a woman at the pub . She had on a red bandanna and hiking clothes . " <p> If things went wrong for her in Ireland , which they seemed about to do , that was n't much for anyone , including the FBI , the Irish Garda and MI6 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooped up the last of her warm crumble , fat blackberries oozing out from under the simple crust of sugar , flour and butter . She sat with her back to the wall , facing out into the pub . " It 's hard for someone to stab you in the back if you 've got it to the wall , " her father had explained on her thirteenth birthday . " At least you 'll have a chance to defend yourself if someone tries to stab you in the heart . You can see the attack coming . " <p> Harlan Rush did n't look at life through rose-colored glasses , and he 'd taught Lizzie , his only child , to do the same . <p> She wanted rose-colored glasses . She wanted , even for a few minutes , to be someone who could settle into a quaint Irish pub on a windy , rainy afternoon without considering that a killer could walk through the door , looking for her . <p> Across the pub , in their thick West Cork accents , the local men kidded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , Lizzie was struck by their ease with each other  --  one that spoke of a lifetime together . She was on her own , and , by choice , had been for much of the past year , at least when it came to her dealings with Norman Estabrook and the FBI . <p> " I was hoping Keira would be here , " Will Davenport said , with just the slightest edge of concern in his voice . <p> Just Keira ? Why not Simon , too ? <p> Lizzie settled back in her chair and reached down to pat the dog , his fur warm from the fire . <p> Something was wrong . <p> Eddie set another frothy-topped pint on the bar . " Keira 's gone to Allihies for the day to research that old story . The one about the three brothers and the stone angel . It got her in trouble once . It has n't again , has it ? " <p> " I stopped in Allihies before driving up here , " Davenport said . " She was n't there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The grandfather of the woman who told it to Keira heard the story in the Allihies copper mines . The last of them shut down years ago . Keira planned to visit the museum that 's opened in the old Cornish church there . " The Irishman lifted the pints onto a tray and gave Davenport a pointed look . " The mansion the British owners built for themselves has been turned into a luxury hotel . " <p> The Brit did n't rise to the bait . " Things change . " <p> " That they do , and sometimes for the better . Other times , not . " <p> " Did Keira say when she 'd return ? " <p> " You 'd think she 'd be back by now , with the gale . That story of hers has drawn curious tourists all summer . " As he walked out from behind the bar with the tray , Eddie glanced toward Lizzie . " They 're all wanting to find the stone angel themselves . " <p> " Assuming it exists , " Davenport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the beers to his fellow villagers . Lizzie was aware that both he and Will Davenport had played a critical role in uncovering the identity of a serial killer who 'd become obsessed with Keira 's story . She and Simon had , from all Lizzie had heard , encountered true evil . That was two months ago , when Simon was supposed to be laying low ahead of Norman 's arrest . <p> While Eddie delivered the drinks , Davenport walked over to the fire , his gaze settling on Lizzie . She was used to being around men . She worked as director of concierge services and excursions for her family 's fifteen highly individual boutique hotels , and she 'd grown up with her four male Rush cousins , who now ranged in age from twenty-two to thirty-four . They were all striking in appearance , but , even so , she felt herself getting hot under the Brit 's scrutiny . He had the bearing and edgy good looks that could spark even the most independent woman to fantasize about having her own prince charming come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Prince Charming for her . Not now , not ever . <p> He nodded to her book , still open at the mesmerizing illustration of the farm . " Is that the Ireland you 've come here to find ? " His eyes , Lizzie saw , were a rich hazel , with flecks of blue , green and gold that changed with the light . " Fairies , thatched roofs and pretty gardens ? " <p> Lizzie smiled . " Maybe it 's the Ireland I have found . " <p> " Do you believe in the wee folk ? " <p> " I 'm keeping an open mind . Keira Sullivan 's quite the artist , is n't she ? I overheard you and the barman . I gather you know her . " <p> " We met earlier this summer . Did you just purchase her book ? " <p> " Yes . I bought it in Kenmare this afternoon . " That was n't true . Keira 's young cousin in Boston , Fiona O'Reilly , a harp student , had given it to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't need to know . " I heard about the story that brought Keira here . Three brothers tussle with fairies over an ancient Celtic stone angel . The brothers believe the angel will bring them good fortune in one form or another , and the fairies believe it 's one of their own turned to stone . " <p> Davenport studied her with half-closed eyes . <p> " It 's a wonderful story , " Lizzie added . <p> " So it is . " His tone gave away nothing . <p> Lizzie pushed her empty plate to the center of the table . She wanted more coffee , but she 'd already drunk two cups and figured they 'd give her enough of a caffeine jolt to counteract any jetlag . She was accustomed to changing time zones but had slept only fitfully on her flight from Boston . <p> She turned the book over to the full-color , back-cover photograph of Keira Sullivan in a dark green velvet dress . She had pretty cornflower-blue eyes , and her long blond hair was decorated with fresh flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think ? " <p> " She could , indeed . " <p> Lizzie doubted she 'd ever pass for a fairy princess , even if she wore velvet and sprinkled flowers in her hair . <p> Not that she was bad looking , but her eyes , a light green , seemed to have perpetual dark circles under them lately . She 'd had a rough few days . <p> A rough year , really . <p> " Do you know Keira ? " Davenport asked . <p> " No , we 've never met . " <p> " But you 're familiar with the story  --  " <p> " It was in all the papers , " Lizzie said , not letting him finish . " Yes . " <p> He was clearly suspicious now , but she did n't care . His presence and Simon 's absence were unexpected and called for a revision of her plan . Whatever she might have ended up telling Simon , she had no intention of telling his friend Lord Davenport anything . <p> She needed more information about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . <p> " What brings you to the Beara Peninsula ? " Davenport asked . <p> " I 'm hiking the Beara Way . " She was n't , and she did n't like to lie , but it was easier  --  and possibly safer for all concerned  --  than telling the truth . " Not start to finish . It 's almost two hundred kilometers . I do n't have that much time to spare . " <p> " You 're on your own ? " <p> She gave him a bright smile . " Now , that 's a bold question to ask a woman having coffee and crumble by herself . " <p> His eyes darkened slightly . " I trust you 've a room for the night . The weather 's terrible . " He gestured back toward the bar where Eddie had returned with his empty tray . " Perhaps Eddie could direct you to a local B and B. " <p> " It 's decent of you to be concerned . " Lizzie doubted concern for her had anything to do with his motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book out , by being there alone by the fire . If she was staying nearby , he wanted to keep an eye on her . " I have a tent . I can always camp somewhere . " <p> She saw the beginnings of a smile . He had a straight mouth , a strong jaw , a hint of a wave to his dark blond hair . As good-looking and expensively dressed as he was , he was n't in any way pretty or soft . <p> " I would n't have taken you for a woman who likes to sleep in a tent , " he said , with the barest hint of humor . <br> Continues ...
