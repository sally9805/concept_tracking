Prologue // At ten o ? clock in the morning on March 4 , 1873  --  Inauguration Day  --  the president and first lady emerged from the White House and headed for their carriage , a grand four-wheeled barouche pulled by four horses . Washington was draped in red-white-and-blue flags , pennants , and bunting ; bold triumphal arches , fashioned out of intertwined flags from around the world , spanned the streets . Pennsylvania Avenue , swept clean , stretched like a bright ribbon to the Capitol , where , at noon , Ulysses Simpson Grant would take the oath of office for the second time . // A blue sky lifted spirits , but , as one reporter noted , " its sunny promise of Spring was contradicted by a fierce north wind that seemed the very breath of Winter . " The gale roared at forty miles per hour , making four degrees above zero ( the official temperature at dawn ) feel like thirty below . Grant and his wife , Julia Dent Grant , pressed together on the leather bench of the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of them in cloth dress gray uniforms . One of the shivering young men collapsed and had to be rushed indoors . // Thousands had journeyed to Washington from out of town ; the hotels were sold out , even after filling their hallways and lobbies with extra beds . The visitors , not a few of whom employed whiskey against the cold , waited all along the avenue to salute the Civil War hero they had reelected the previous November . No group cheered Grant more heartily than the Negro men and women who lined his route . These members of the audience could point with pride to the Lincoln Zouaves , a colored military unit from Baltimore , resplendent in their tasseled fezzes , baggy red pants , white leggings , and red-trimmed black jackets . Colored spectators sang along when musicians struck up " Marching Through Georgia , " the Civil War ditty celebrating General William Tecumseh Sherman ? s drive from Atlanta to the sea . " Hurrah ! Hurrah ! The jubilee has come , " they chorused . " We ? ll all join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s marching through Georgia . " // Negro support for Grant was an expression of hope  --  the fervent belief that only Grant and his Republican Party , the party of Lincoln , could keep America ? s promise of equal rights for all men . Lincoln had been the first president to invite Negro participation in the inaugural pageant ; Grant was the second . But for Grant , freedom and equal rights were matters of principle , not symbolism . More than even the most progressive-minded white Americans of his time , he rejected prejudice . " I don ? t know why a black skin may not cover a true heart as well as a white one , " he said . He knew his soldiers had sacrificed not only to hold the nation together but also to make men free . He did not want those sacrifices to have been in vain . // The North might not have won the Civil War without Grant , and his contributions to the liberation of four million people of color had continued . But at first , Reconstruction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president in March 1865 , then succeeded Lincoln after his assassination a month later . Johnson had ceded control of Southern state legislatures to former Confederates , who in turn enacted Black Codes that all but reenslaved the freedmen . The codes contradicted the Thirteenth Amendment , which abolished slavery when ratified in December 1865 , and Johnson faced growing resistance from a " Radical " Republican Congress  --  culminating in the Reconstruction Act adopted on March 2 , 1867 , over Johnson ? s veto . The legislation required Southern states to repeal the Black Codes and recognize the political equality of Negroes  --  both by granting them the vote and by ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment , which , for the first time , made Negroes citizens with the same rights as white people . // Grant , too , resisted Johnson ? s version of Reconstruction . As the U.S. Army ? s top-ranking officer , Grant had encouraged his generals in the South to enforce the Reconstruction Act strictly , especially its provisions on voter registration , which barred unrepentant ex-rebel officials from voting . He occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized the military to make arrests for racial offenses where civilian law enforcement had broken down . In 1868 , when Johnson provoked his impeachment and near conviction in the Senate by trying to fire the Radical Republican secretary of war , Edwin Stanton , Grant backed Stanton . After his own successful campaign for president in 1868 , Grant lobbied hard for the Fifteenth Amendment , which required states to let all eligible voters cast a ballot , regardless of race . It was controversial not only in the South but also in the North , where many states still banned or restricted voting by colored men . // Negro voting rights were politically necessary for Grant and his party . Before the Civil War , the Republicans were exclusively a Northern party ; but afterward , they would have to win elections in the South , state and federal , lest the Southern-based Democratic Party retake control of the federal government and reverse the Union victory . And the Republicans could not do that unless Negroes , their natural  --  and most numerous  --  constituency , were free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amendment , though , went beyond expediency . When it won ratification , on February 3 , 1870 , he exulted that the people had completed the eradication of the notorious Dred Scott decision , handed down by the Supreme Court in 1857 , which had decreed that neither slaves nor free men of color could be citizens of the United States . He called the amendment " a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day . " // And President Grant tackled the Ku Klux Klan . // Southern freedmen lived in poverty after the civil war , but so did most of the region ? s whites , for whom economic misery was compounded by the shock and humiliation of defeat . Searching for companionship amid the devastation , some ex-Confederates formed clubs where they could drink , reminisce , and complain . One such group , founded in Pulaski , Tennessee , in late 1865 , grew into a secret society with " dens " across the southeastern United States . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country either belonged to the organization or sympathized with it . " This is an institution of Chivalry , Humanity , Mercy and Patriotism , embodying in its genius and its principles all that is chivalric in conduct , noble in sentiment , generous in manhood and patriotic in purpose , " the Ku Klux Klan declared . Its goals were to " protect the weak , innocent and defenseless , " and " to protect and defend the constitution of the United States . " Actually , the Klan aimed to terrorize all Negroes and the white Republicans who supported them . // In 1868 , the Klan assassinated a Negro Republican congressman in Arkansas and three black Republican members of the South Carolina legislature  --  and in Camilla , Georgia , four hundred Klansmen , led by the sheriff , fired on a black election parade and hunted the countryside for those who fled , eventually killing or wounding more than twenty people . A Klan-led " nigger chase " in Laurens County , South Carolina , claimed thirteen lives in the fall of 1870 . Thanks in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Democrats had returned to power in Alabama , Virginia , Tennessee , North Carolina , and Georgia in the 1870 elections . This only seemed to encourage more Klan terror elsewhere . In January 1871 , five hundred masked men attacked the Union County jail in South Carolina and lynched eight black prisoners . In March 1871 , the Klan killed thirty Negroes in Meridian , Mississippi . // For Grant and the Republican Congress , tolerating the Klan was out of the question , but the Northern public was in no mood for a new war against it , either . The only alternative was to treat white terrorism as a crime  --  to investigate the Klan , identify its murderers , and try them in federal courts . The problem was that fighting crime had always been a state function ; federal law enforcement was still an unfamiliar concept in mid-nineteenth-century America . Even many Republicans doubted its constitutionality. // Nevertheless , the Fourteenth Amendment said Congress had the power to enforce civil rights , and the Fifteenth Amendment said Congress had the power to protect qualified Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invoking the new amendments as authority , Congress passed the Enforcement Act , which made racist terrorism a federal offense . To help put it into effect , Grant and Congress created the Department of Justice , with authority over all federal civil and criminal cases . Its first leader , Attorney General Amos T. Akerman , was a Republican who had been born in New Hampshire but settled in Georgia before the war . He loathed the Klan . " These combinations amount to war , " he said , " and can not be effectually crushed under any other theory . " // When Klan violence persisted , Grant had sought more authority from Congress , personally lobbying for amendments known as the Ku Klux Klan Act . Enacted on April 20 , 1871 , the legislation imposed heavy new penalties and branded the Klan an " insurrection " and a " rebellion " against the United States . For the remainder of his first term , the president would be empowered to suspend the writ of habeas corpus anywhere state and local authorities had fallen under the sway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president could use the army to round up Klansmen and present them for trial in federal court . // In October 1871 , Grant had declared a " state of lawlessness " in nine Klan-dominated counties of South Carolina , dispatching troops who helped arrest hundreds of Klansmen and drive another two thousand out of state . Rank-and-file Klansmen who confessed and quit the organization were let go , but 220 leaders were indicted , of whom 53 pled guilty and 5 were convicted at trial  --  before juries which included colored men . By July 1872 , there were some 65 Klan leaders from across the South incarcerated in the federal prison at Albany , New York , serving sentences of up to five years . " Peace has come to many places as never before , " the black abolitionist Frederick Douglass wrote . " The scourging and slaughter of our people have so far ceased . " // Yet Grant ? s attack on the klan triggered a political backlash which ultimately spread to the Republicans ? own ranks . The reaction was strongest in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle with the Klan simply underscored the fact that Reconstruction , for all its initial promise , had turned into a long , violent slog . As a postwar economic boom accelerated in the North and West , the press in those regions covered the South as if it were some troubled foreign land . Papers vividly described alleged corruption in Republican Southern state governments , which were reportedly controlled by Northern adventurers who owed their offices to the manipulated votes of illiterate Negroes . More and more white Northerners agreed with their Southern brethren that colored men were unfit for citizenship  --  and that , in some sense , they and not the Klan were to blame for the mess the South had become . // In the 1872 election , Grant ? s main opponent had been an apostate Republican : Horace Greeley , the publisher of the New York Tribune . Greeley ? s so-called Liberal Republicans , who included such prominent senators as Carl Schurz of Missouri and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts , walked out of their old party under the banner of " reform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameless activities of railroad lobbyists and Grant ? s distribution of government favors to cronies and party hacks . Greeley ? s other campaign theme was the injustice of Grant ? s policy in the South . Once an ardent abolitionist , Greeley had soured on the freedmen . Their failure to prosper disappointed him . " They are an easy , worthless race , taking no thought for the morrow , " he said . Backed by the Democrats , the party of the white South , Greeley ran on a platform that denounced Grant ? s Klan policy as " arbitrary measures " and called for " local self-government " in the ex-Confederacy. // Grant ultimately defeated Greeley easily . Thanks in part to the president ? s timely crackdown on the Klan , the November 1872 election was the most peaceful of Reconstruction , and a half-million Southern Negroes cast ballots printed with Grant ? s name . In Alabama , Republicans even took back the governorship and legislature . But the Liberal Republican challenge had heightened the contradictions within the Republican Party . It had forced Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klan with concessions . The Republican Congress shelved a civil rights bill , and , in May 1872 , it enacted an amnesty law that restored full political rights to the vast majority of ex-Confederates who had been barred from office under a special provision of the Fourteenth Amendment . Only a few hundred top Confederate officials remained unpardoned . This act energized Southern white politics with a fresh injection of leadership . Perhaps more important , it betrayed a hint of irresolution in Washington . // Grant finished the trip down Pennsylvania Avenue , and , at three minutes before noon , entered the Senate chamber . Awaiting him were the senators , fifty foreign diplomats in colorful dress uniforms , the Supreme Court justices in their black robes  --  and two thousand men and women prominent and lucky enough to have tickets . Impassive in his black suit , Grant sat through some speeches before following the Supreme Court out to the East Portico of the Capitol , where an inauguration platform had been erected and decorated with flags and evergreens . Julia Dent Grant emerged first , escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president ? s arm was his daughter Nellie , seventeen years old . Grant sat briefly in the same mahogany chair George Washington had used at his first inaugural . Little puffs of condensed breath , swirling in the wind , floated among the assembled dignitaries . // Slowly , the chief justice of the United States , Salmon P. Chase , made his way toward the president . Pale and feeble , Chase , sixty-five years old , had coveted the presidency himself for many years , but now he was a dying man , clutching an open Bible supplied by the clerk of the Supreme Court . Grant rose , removed his hat , and placed his left hand on the pages . He raised his right hand and repeated the oath of office after Chase : " I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States  --  so help me God . " // Then , following a tradition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words upon which his hand had lain . As Grant had requested , the Bible was open to Isaiah , chapter 11 , " Christ ? s Peaceable Kingdom . " The passage was a prophecy of wise government and a tribute to his father , Jesse Grant . // And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse // And a branch shall grow out of his roots // And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him // The spirit of wisdom and understanding // The spirit of counsel and might // The spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord // And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord // And he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes // Neither reprove after the hearing of his ears // But with righteousness shall he judge the poor // And reprove with equity for the meek of the earth . // A roar went up from the crowd . The howitzer battery of the Naval School and the Army Light Artillery joined in a twenty-one-gun salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the shivering multitude . He hated public speaking and dreaded it . Yet by his usual standard , Grant ? s second inaugural address was positively expansive . He began with a firm defense of his policy in the South : " The effects of the late civil strife have been to free the slave and make him a citizen . Yet he is not possessed of the civil rights which citizenship should carry with it . This is wrong , and should be corrected . To this correction I stand committed , so far as Executive influence can avail . " Grant assured whites that " social equality is not a subject to be legislated upon . " Yet , in issuing that disclaimer , he supported the freedmen . He would do nothing , he said , to " advance the social status of the colored man except to give him a fair chance to develop what there is good in him , give him access to the schools , and when he travels let him feel assured that his conduct will regulate the treatment and the fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even this moderate agenda  --  an allusion to provisions of the civil rights bill which the Republicans had downplayed during the campaign  --  was anathema to Southern whites , and many Northern ones , too . Still , Grant claimed that the old Confederacy was coming around . Answering those who charged him with despotism for using the military against the Klan , he noted that " the States lately at war with the General Government are now happily rehabilitated , and no Executive control is exercised in any one of them that would not be exercised in any other state in like circumstances . " In any case , Grant continued , the telegraph and steamboat were breaking down barriers to mutual understanding : " Our Great Maker is preparing the world , in His own good time , to become one nation , speaking one language , and when armies and navies will be no longer required , " he declared . // Finally , he took a parting shot at his political enemies . " I did not ask for place or position " before the war " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influence , " Grant said . All he had done since the firing on Fort Sumter was his duty . Yet , " throughout the war , and from my candidacy for the present office in 1868 to the close of the last campaign , I have been the subject of abuse and slander scarcely equaled in political history , which today I feel that I can afford to disregard in view of your verdict , which I gratefully accept as my vindication . " Fortunately for Grant , given the rancor of this peroration , the wind shrieked so loudly that only people next to him could hear what he said . // As the president left the podium , he might have noticed the bright fezzes of the Lincoln Zouaves bobbing among the crowd . He surely spotted a group of Union veterans , standing beneath frayed flags emblazoned with the names of historic battles : Fredericksburg , Roanoke , Atlanta . The tattered banners flapped in the wind , emblems of Grant ? s glory days . That night , technicians illuminated the Capitol dome with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkled . The president and the first lady went off to the Inaugural Ball , which was being held near the Capitol in a hangarlike temporary pavilion made out of pine boards draped with muslin . Dignitaries gamely shuffled across the dance floor in their overcoats , as horn and tuba players squeaked out music through the frozen valves of their instruments . Dozens of birdcages dangled from the ceiling ; the canaries inside were supposed to accompany the orchestra . But the cold was so intense that the birds shivered , tucked their beaks under their wings , and then began to drop dead . // The truth was that Grant had won a battle in November 1872  --  not a war . The victory he interpreted as personal vindication , and which gave his black supporters hope , kept Reconstruction alive . But it hardly extinguished all threats to the political rights of freedmen in the South or to the Republican-led national government that protected  --  and depended upon  --  the exercise of those rights . Rather , the conflicts with the Klan and the Liberal Republicans , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political and racial fissures menacing Reconstruction . // As of Inauguration Day 1873 , only two of the eleven states that had once made up the Confederacy  --  black-majority South Carolina and Mississippi  --  remained under firm Republican control . Georgia , North Carolina , Tennessee , and Virginia had long since been " redeemed , " thanks in part to Klan violence . Republicans governed Alabama , but Democrats had conceded the statehouse only under pressure from U.S. troops sent by Grant . In Texas and Florida , Democrats controlled all or part of the state legislatures and were harassing Republican governors . Arkansas ? s Republican Party had split in two . // And Louisiana was in chaos . //
