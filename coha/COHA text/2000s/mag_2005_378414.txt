A mystery solved is a mystery filed and at least half forgotten . A mystery unsolved , subject to endless speculation , has the power to haunt us as long as memory persists , as long as the human animal retains its power to sip Chardonnay and contemplate life 's enigmas . <P> They are not many , those persistently insoluble puzzles  --  the fates of Judge Crater and Amelia Earhart , Thomas Pynchon 's unlisted phone number  --  but they add a dash of darkness to a world that generally appears to us in flat primary colors . Of them all , the identity of Deep Throat had been , for the past 33 years , the most tantalizing of those questions  --  in part because he placed himself at risk to bring down a corrupt government , in part because of the romantically noirish way he was portrayed in All the President 's Men , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein 's book about how they got their big Watergate story and , more significantly , in the movie retelling of their exploits . <P> " Weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watergate burglars , when he caught a glimpse last week of the former mystery man on TV  --  but only in the eye of that obviously biased beholder . There were , perhaps , more disappointing ( if quite predictable ) realities about W. Mark Felt when he confessed his secret identity . For one thing , he is really old ( 91 ) . For another , he was visibly feeble , clinging to his walker and speaking haltingly . If he had to step out of the shadows , we would have preferred that he did so looking smart and knowing  --  more like a guy in a movie , wherein everyone is forever ageless , than like a senior citizen looking to supplement his Social Security . <P> " Follow the money , " Deep Throat immortally advised Woodward , and the fact that Felt was now himself doing so , trying to parlay his Vanity Fair confession into a book deal , distressed some people . Besides retaining their looks , the spring in their stride , people who do good things are not supposed to cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had other , less than noble motives for his actions  --  he was angry at the Nixon Administration because he was passed over for the directorship of the FBI  --  also counted against him . When altruism is tainted by apparently mean  --  actually entirely human  --  spirits , people tend to become cynical in their responses to that new , more truthful reality . <P> But the real sin of that little old man blinking in the California sunlight was against narrative conventions . If you go back and study the movie version of All the President 's Men , which retains , long after the fact , its itchy power , you see that without Deep Throat , it would be a much less absorbing film . Mostly it is about a pair of reporters wearing out shoe leather , often enough in broad daylight or under the bright lights of the Washington Post newsroom , as they pursue their frustrating leads . That is entertaining , especially because we know how high the stakes in the game are . But it is not electrifying.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
