Section : Culture <p> TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX PRODUCT THAT REVELWOOD Inc. ( #344 ) makes , it 's best to click onto the company 's Web site , where you 'll find a slick demo of its business-planning software . But to understand the company itself , you 're better off dropping into its Manhattan offices any day around lunchtime . <p> Crammed into the conference room  --  or out near the office 's elevator banks if the conference room is actually being used for its intended purpose , which is training  --  most of Revelwood 's 35 New York City employees line up every day to throw palm-size colored balls at the Game Center Jr. , a collapsible mini &shy; basketball court . The manufacturer of the game , Playhut Inc. , claims that the game is designed " for the little ones . " Revelwood players , however , tend to be in their twenties or thirties . Those who are n't shooting jeer from the sidelines . <p> The game  --  which is shaped sort of like a miniature pinball machine with a hoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . There 's a whiteboard on the wall nearby where player rankings are updated daily . A Webcam scans the room , enabling Revelwood comrades who are stationed elsewhere to watch the game online or to nab employees who happen to be taking practice shots  --  an activity that 's expressly verboten , as spelled out in the company 's 10-page rule book . Repeated offenses can lead to " lifetime banishment " from the game . Sound harsh ? " We had to make a bunch of rules based on keeping our business going , " says Robert Gordy , 33 , Revelwood 's chief technology officer . <p> Gordy , who blames his poor shooting percentage on " lack of coordination , " nonetheless plays every day . " Every time you throw the ball , it 's different , " he says . " It 's addictive . " It was Gordy who plunked down $30 for the game a year ago , buying it for his two young daughters but never actually giving it to them . Instead he decided to bring it into the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining up to take eight shots from 10 feet away . ( A full match consists of three rounds of eight shots . ) " By the end of the year it was like a fever , " Gordy says . Because he had purchased the game , Gordy was invited to compete in the first quarterly play-off series . <p> By then employees had formed the American Mini-Basketball Association ( AMBA ) and appointed Jason Maston , Revelwood 's marketing-communications specialist , as " commissioner . " Product manager Joe Paradise , the 1999 AMBA World Champion , whose tiptoe shot has earned him the nickname " the Ballerina , " assembled the rule book . There 's also the lore-laden AMBA Council , which is described in Paradise 's tome as a " closed society whose members are secretly chosen and who are inducted during an ancient and holy ritual . " The regulations are still evolving ; recently the rule book was appended to include a page-long passage regarding balls that exit the court 's discharge hole and roll back to where the player is standing ( known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feat three times in a row ( a Super-Spectacular Ball ) is deemed " possessed by the devil " and disqualified " until an exorcism is successfully performed . " <p> Surely it would take an extraordinary ritual to counteract the sport 's hypnotic effect . Nearly everyone in the office comes around to watch the play-offs and the finals , and trophies are awarded . " The pressure 's really high , " says Maston , a consistently high scorer who has sadly choked at play-off time . <p> Employees think of the game as the Great Equalizer , where the front-desk receptionist might go up against Kenneth Wolf , who is not only the five-year-old company 's president , CEO , and cofounder but also a previous champion . Playing helps relieve the pressure of chasing relentless software-product cycles and otherwise keeping up with the pace at the fast-growing company , where sales soared to nearly $3.5 million last year . " It 's really for people who like to lead the culture and like a challenge , " theorizes Laura Cote , director of human resources and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an observer . Plus , I 'm terrible at it . " <p> Cote uses the game as an opportunity to observe how employees interact  --  and how well a person deals with competition or diffuses an overly intense teasing situation . She felt reassured about her recent decision to hire Melissa Bruno-Torres as a recruiter after watching her play ball . " She was supportive and aggressive , and very competitive , " Cote observes . " That 's just what you need to be a recruiter . " Paradise has suggested having all job applicants shoot some minihoop as part of the interview process  --  an idea Cote has rejected as too extreme , even for Revelwood . <p> Besides , those who already work at Revelwood are sometimes stymied by the company 's fascination with the game . " They have a lot of fun , but they work really hard at it , " says Bruno-Torres , who joined Revelwood in June . " Sometimes it 's taken a bit too seriously . " <p> Things did look serious in the spring when word of Playhut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Gordy , Wolf heard the news from his wife , who called him directly from a toy store . Maston , as commissioner , called the game 's manufacturer . As it turned out , the game was only being renamed . But a Playhut official , upon hearing about the adults ' unusual devotion to it , assured Maston that she would be passing that nugget on to her company 's marketing department . <p> Revelwood 's love of the game has already caught on a bit . Wolf 's brother-in-law , Gary Faber , got hooked after playing , and now regularly indulges in what he calls " extreme AMBA " with about 10 friends . " It 's a hard game , but it 's hilarious because it 's designed for three-year-olds , " says Faber , a publicist for Miramax Films Corp . " It 's nothing like taking a 10-minute break and shooting pool . It 's a state of mind . " <p> That 's about as cogent a description as anyone can  --  or maybe cares to  --  offer of the AMBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about productivity " when Gordy first brought the Game Center Jr . to the company . Now Wolf 's known for his superb come-from-behind clutch shooting in the postseason . " It 's really important , " he says of mini-basketball . But when asked why , he 's at a loss for words . This much he knows , though : so far , no one who has played the game has voluntarily left Revelwood . <p> NET GAIN : Revelwood cofounder Daniel Bernatchez takes his best shot , cheered on by cofounder and CEO Kenneth Wolf  --  among many others . <p> By Samuel Fromartz <p> <p> Samuel Fromartz , who played on his college basketball team , is a freelance writer in Washington , D.C. <p>
