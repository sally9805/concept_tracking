What Does It Mean to Be 13 ? The special report from inside the mysterious and challenging world of the 13-year-old drew mail from young teenagers who were sometimes a bit skeptical but happy to have the attention and from parents who were relieved to learn that they could survive their children 's teenage years after all <P> My daughter just entered her teens , a time I had been dreading . But after reading your articles on " Being 13 " Aug. 8 , I realized I wo n't need to resort to medication to cope with the exciting changes that she will undergo over the next few years . Thanks ! <P> JANE STEELE Winchester , Kentucky <P> TIME 's special report provided great insight into the minds of young teenagers today . As an adult , I 'm aware that many people argue that our teens are more troubled and troublemaking than when we were growing up . That argument is a poor excuse for our failure to meet children 's needs . Kids ' behavior is as much a response to adults ' repugnance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as complex individuals who will live up to the expectations we set for them . Let 's set them high . <P> JESSICA HERRMANN Chicago <P> My heart goes out to the younger generation now , who have to juggle so many different tasks . The future may not be as bright as 13-year-olds deserve , but I am optimistic that they will make it through O.K. Hats off to them ! <P> MOZEENA BANO Fairfax , Va . <P> Being 13 really is not so easy anymore . I am close to 21 , and I remember 13 as an age that was much simpler than it is today . We did n't have iPods , cell phones or other wireless devices . Kids grow up so fast now , and have become a lot more mature in this fast-paced , high-tech world . The first-person essays by the 13-year-olds you published were very impressive . They showed honesty , insight and a high level of writing . Those young authors had a personal story to tell and are trying to find and define themselves , just as we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 13 . <P> JESSICA MAN Boston <P> I appreciated reading young Duresny Nemorin 's personal essay " Poetry Is What I Love . " Thirteen-year-olds are the most exciting students to teach because they are so spontaneous and filled with curiosity about life . Writing a poem on the theme " Who Am I ? " is an assignment I learned about at a convention of English teachers , and I have used it in classes ever since . It routinely produces the finest poetry of any I receive during the school year . <P> SHEILA BOERNER North Platte , Neb . <P> I was 13 only three years ago , and I know that is the age at which children are able to fashion themselves into the teenagers they have been waiting for years to become . Many of today 's 13-year-olds believe they are mature enough for sexual relationships , dating and distancing themselves from their family . Their friends have a significant impact on the metamorphosis that goes on during those transition years . Many of the changes teenagers go through take place behind closed doors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the party . Although teens tend to withdraw from family at that time , it is very important that parents keep connected with them . Allowing young teens just to find their own way can be very dangerous . <P> KRISTIN S. TORRES Fresno , Calif.
