TODAY 'S BEST WALLEYE ANGLERS ARE INVENTING NEW WAYS TO LAND MORE FISH . LEARN THEIR SECRETS OR BE LEFT BEHIND . MAYBE YOU THINK of walleye pros as the minor leaguers of tournament angling , unknown wannabes hunkered over jigs and slip bobbers while the big-league bass boys take all the glory and the six-figure checks . Several years ago , you might have been right . But in 2006 , professional walleye anglers pocketed nearly $5 million , as the two major circuits  --  the Professional Walleye Trail and the FLW Walleye Tour  --  filled every field for the first time . With serious competition comes serious innovation : Pros looking for an edge are inventing new tactics and updating old ones . And just as the explosion in bass tournaments propelled a giant leap forward in techniques and tackle for everyday anglers , the innovations of today 's top walleye pros can help you put more fish in the boat . Here are six of their hottest secrets . 1 Stay Bold in the Cold After a cold front shuts down the bite , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry Good . He goes bold , using bigger lures and erratic retrieves to provoke reaction strikes . " I like to rip a jigging spoon , " Good says , noting that this classic ice-fishing lure can also fire up lethargic open-water walleyes . Choose a - to - ounce model and cast to the edges of weedbeds , timber , or rocky structure . Wait for it to flutter to the bottom , then jerk the rod tip to rip the spoon toward the boat . Let it sink and repeat . If this action does n't trip a fish 's fuse , Good tries the same presentation with a 1/8- to - ounce jig and a 3-inch shiner. 2 Get on Board For eliciting bites from walleyes , the use of planer boards has been , according to Tommy Skarlis , " the biggest advancement in the last 10 years of tournament fishing . " But , he admits , it 's all for nothing if you miss those strikes . When he trolls a crawler harness beneath a board , Skarlis boats more of the subtle biters by adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800-237-4444 ; cabelas.com ) . The flag signals any slight change of the planer 's action . Also , because short-striking walleyes often nip the bait below the terminal hook on a standard harness , Skarlis puts a No. 10 light-wire treble at the very end of the crawler to nab sneaky bait stealers. 3 Do the Slide To increase hookups as he searches for scattered fish suspended in open water , Ted Takasaki adds slider rigs to his trolling setup . These are basically droppers attached to the main trolling line via a sliding snap about halfway between the planer board and the boat . Where legal , sliders let you cover a wider swath of water and try a variety of baits to pinpoint what walleyes want on a given day . Takasaki uses a heavier dropper line ( usually 20-pound ) than his main line to help prevent tangling . The key to the tactic , he says , is to vary the depth ( by adding more weight or longer line ) and spinners and crank-baits until you start getting hit . 4 Lighten Up A Roach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live bait along promising bottom structure . It typically features an 8-pound-test main line and leader and a - ounce sinker . But when the bite turns tough , Mike Gofron tweaks this old standby for a more natural presentation . First , he lightens things up with a 6-pound mono main line , a 3/8-ounce sinker , and a 4- to 8-foot-long 4-pound leader . Second , he anchors directly above marked fish and presents the rig vertically . " With your finger on the line , you 'll feel the minnow start to get livelier , " Gofron says . " It 's acting that way because a walleye is right on its tail . " That 's when you want to open the bail to let the bait swim free  --  the panicked flight will attract a strike from the walleye. 5 Crank a Crawler The crawler harness is n't just for bottom fishing anymore . When walleyes suspend high in the water column ( and where multiple lines are legal ) , Paul Meleen pairs this traditional favorite with a deep-diving crankbait . This enables him to better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crankbait 's diving action keeps the lures separated and contributes movement to the spinner . Here 's how to rig it : A three-way swivel goes on the end of your main line . To the top ring , tie a 5-foot leader and connect a crawler harness with a quick-change clevis . On the remaining ring , tie a 10-foot leader and attach a snap and a crankbait . With the snap and the clevis , you can change baits easily . Switch often until you start nailing fish . 6 Be a Jerk When bass pros complained about catching too many walleyes on his home waters in west-central Wisconsin , Nick Johnson copied their tactics . He started retrieving a suspending jerkbait over shallow structure and discovered that aggressive postspawn walleyes are just as quick as bass to clobber what appears to be a wounded baitfish . Copy Johnson by casting a Berkley Frenzy , Rapala Husky Jerk , or Lucky Craft Pointer SP to shorelines , rock piles , or submerged weeds in 2 to 6 feet of water . Point the rod tip toward the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in slowly to create an erratic , rolling action . Pause several seconds and resume snapping . Be ready for walleyes to strike on the pause .
