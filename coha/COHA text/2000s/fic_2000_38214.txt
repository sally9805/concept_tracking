FOR TWENTY YEARS JOE EARLEY encouraged his mother to divorce his father . They were no good together . Fought blow for blow . Not physically , understand , but sniping , from the bedroom , over the kitchen table , outdoors , in company . And then , just when he 'd given up , his mother left his father after thirty-five years , and Joe discovered , despite his brave urgings , his parents ' divorce hurt , though by that time he was himself married and had two children . Four months after the divorce , his mother married Harold , a wildlife artist-good God-who planned to make his career by winning the annual federal duck-stamp competition . " Certain glory , " Harold said . A pie-in-the-sky thing , just the sort Joe 's mother always fell for . <p> To make matters worse , they all continued to live in the same small central Idaho town , Cordwood , where all the neighbors were the same neighbors and everybody 's business was everybody else 's . And now this-adultery . Especially with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomely threesome that was . Enough to make a son pack his bags , wife and children , and flee the tiny town-two square streets of one- and two-story business buildings , surrounded by blocks of single-family homes-whose only respites from boredom were gossip and the annual sausage feed . The only thing lacking ? A town crier . Just beyond town were dairy farms and wheatfields , interrupted by the occasional legumes , ending in the foothills of the Seven Devils on one side and the Gospel Range on the other . <p> The Devils were out today , their horned peaks white-capped and cheerful . Joe goosed his rig through Cordwood 's three stop signs and one light , past the West One Bank and the Log In Bar , the Lewis-Clark movie house whose owner , Harvey Manners , an ex-logger Christian fundamentalist , was bankrupting himself by limiting features to G and PG . Double bill-Charlie the Lonesome Cougar and The Shaggy Dog . Again . All these years later . <p> Off Main Street he turned on Quackamore , and four houses down pulled into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he cracked the door to the July heat that evaporated the spit in his mouth . The sprinkler was on . His son lay under it , hands crossed over his chest in imitation of the dead . Ted waved a weary hand , lifted his head to peer at his dad and dropped it back down on the brown grass . Always brown . Just another losing battle . <p> He opened the screen door , called " I 'm home " - no answer . He peeked in Maggie 's room and saw her asleep on the bed , shades drawn . She was naked , her small buttocks poking up in the air the way an infant sleeps . Joe was startled and mildly embarrassed . A wanton little thing-shedding clothes in the grocery store , outdoors , at the breakfast table . His wife , Grace , was at the kitchen table with a glass of iced tea , reading the classifieds . <p> " If we bought a dog , there 'd be someone to greet me , " he said . <p> " Um-hum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice to see you home , dear , I missed you , did you have a good day dear , would you like dinner ? Some fathers come home to children grabbing them around the knees . Our son 's playing dead under the sprinkler . Our daughter 's sleeping with her bare butt stuck up in the air for God and everyone to see- " <p> " If we bought a cat , you 'd have something to kick , " she said . <p> " Am I crabby ? " <p> She crossed to him , ran her hand over his forehead , and kissed his cheek . " I 've had a hellish day , " she said . <p> " How about tomorrow I come home , the kids spread rose petals in my path . I walk in the house and find you sleeping with your bare butt in the air ? " <p> " You 're right . " She laughed . " We need a dog . " <p> Stooping , he wrapped his arms around her . This was good , the feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair smelling of strawberries , the way it mussed under his chin . In his own home . With a kitchen the color of slab butter . There might be better things in this world , but he was n't convinced . He wanted to believe that this was all marriage was ever meant to be , that you could live happily ever after in the same pair of arms , but evidence to the contrary was tucked in his pocket-a picture of his mother he 'd discovered while lunching at his father 's house . Left out . Carelessly . Maybe purposefully-his mother in a chair , dressed in a scanty nightgown , a motel-room painting behind her . And on the back , in his father 's scrawling print : Emmaline . Dated three weeks ago . <p> Grace squirmed in his arms . " Woof , " she said . <p> They took the kids to Becky 's Burgers , stuffed their bellies before packing them into bed . Then Grace baked potatoes and grilled steaks ; a bottle of Merlot was airing beside chilled peaches . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she answered . He did n't mention anything to Grace , sneaking off like an adulterer himself to make the calls . <p> Grace had changed into a nightgown , the one with the thin straps that kept shrugging off her shoulders in a way he found ingenious . He loved hooking them back up , letting his thumb graze a moment longer than necessary where the little crease of skin at her armpit turned under neatly as a secret . This time the left strap had slipped . There was candlelight on the table , glass coasters , and a hank of daisies . She 'd cleared the plates before he had a chance to swab up the grease and blood with a slice of bread and detract from the mood . But after the steak , and especially after the wine , he felt compelled to tell her about his parents . Maybe his timing was off . Maybe this was n't quite what Grace had in mind , because after he produced the picture she hiked her own straps up , sat brooding . <p> " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That 's it ? My mother 's running around with my father behind her husband 's back , and you say she looks good in red ? " <p> She looked confused . " Well , she does . The rest is n't my business . " He tipped the bottle of Merlot , and a crimson stream dribbled out . <p> " Tell me that once the word gets out . " <p> " You act like this is a new thing on the face of the earth . It happens all the time . Adultery . " <p> " Not in Idaho . Not with my mother . " <p> " He 's her husband-was-whatever . It 's sort of endearing . They must miss each other . " She patted his hand as if he were a misdirected child . <p> She was so composed , and he knew how he must look , a man whose spreading paunch belied the child he still felt like , embarrassed at the thought of his parents ' sexuality , his mother 's infidelity . Grace had taken it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear she was willing to condone more than he could . He was caught off balance , not just by her reaction , but by his inability to foresee it . He was n't so sure he knew his wife anymore . It was the wine , he decided , that made her more worldly than himself , able to swallow the news like an unfortunate piece of gristle and then go on with the meal , with the rest of her life . " You 're saying you understand this ? " <p> She laughed , and the tip of her tongue wicked out between her lips . " Because it 's not you cheating on me . " She got serious . " Have n't you ever thought about adultery ? " <p> He felt the steak congeal in his stomach . He felt ill . She 'd asked as if it was a familiar question , an idea she tarried with while the kids took naps . " No , " he said , " I do n't . " <p> " Liar , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hick who loved his wife too much to look at others . It had never occurred to him it might not be the same for her . Did she think about other men , maybe an old high-school love  --  Jake Bently at the hardware store-or someone he did n't know , a newcomer to town , or worse yet , some packing boy at the grocer 's ? He 'd believed he knew her so well-the way she sat with her heels hooked beneath her buttocks when her back hurt . The way she ground her teeth to keep from making noise when they made love , or bit the pillow-the children sleeping in the next room , the walls thin as the chambers of a heart . He 'd always believed himself an observant man with a certain acumen for reading women 's needs , a skill his father had refused to develop . <p> " You 're really upset by this , are n't you ? " she asked . <p> " I feel like a fool . All those years I told her to get out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Other women ? " she asked . <p> He shrugged . His father had been a log-truck driver , a rugged , good-looking man who came home with aching kidneys and a well-used look that Joe , in his teen years of wakening sexuality , had come to attribute to something other than long hours behind the wheel . Curly looked used in a new way . <p> Joe laid his soiled napkin on the table . " And if there were other women , what 's it matter now , all these years later ? She 's gone back for more . " <p> " Your father 's not the same person . He 's been depressed . She 's probably worried about him . " She blew out a candle . <p> " Worried , you check a person 's temperature , send flowers , a getwell card . That 's worried . " <p> She ignored him , licked two fingertips and snuffed the smoking wick between them . " But poor Harold . Do you think he knows ? " <p> And there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasters under his drinks , who painted birds , and was willing to live with all the froufrou-doilies , patchwork pillows , wreaths of dried flowers-that Emmaline was so fond of . A gentle man who must have thought he 'd won it all when he snatched her from Curly . No . It would never occur to Harold unless someone trumpeted it in his ears . And in Cordwood , someone would . <p> She blew out the second candle , led him by the hand to their room . When she lifted the gown over her head , she was beautiful , her stomach mildly pooched from childbearing , small stretch marks shining like rain on a windowpane . He thought it utterly wonderful that her body could detail their lives together . And there she was , warm and inviting and his . He felt like crying . He excused himself and went into their bathroom , where he ran the water while looking in the mirror . He had his mother 's gray eyes , full lips , and narrow forehead . He felt betrayed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never found the picture or visited his father that afternoon . He wished his wife were the woman he imagined her to be . He wished his parents were other than who they were . <p> The next morning was Saturday , a day off from his job as loan officer at the bank . He found his brother at Smitty 's Auto Repair on 15th Avenue , where Chuck worked as a grease monkey . Their motto-We 'll fix your heap for a whole heap less . There was an ' 84 Grand Prix on the lift . It belonged to Zack Garner , the prosecuting attorney , an avowed philanthropist without the means , who spent his salary maintaining the arts-a significant need in Cordwood if you counted quilting , whittling , and chainsaw sculpture . Tom Higgin 's boy was manning the pumps . One gas station , full service . They had you by the balls in this town . <p> Chuck was under the rear axle with a trouble light . His coveralls were striped with grease where he wiped his hands . His hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and that , by the end of the day , obeyed under a shellac of motor oil . He wore his work like a lover . Chuck knew tools-ratchet wrench , torque wrench , spark-plug socket , crimper , clamp-like Joe knew spreadsheets and numbers . He envied Chuck 's down-to-earth competence , how he could listen to a motor 's ping , diagnose it , tighten the bolt , replace the part , send it back , humming , to its befuddled owner . Where 'd he gotten that ? The same place he got his looks , his straight black hair-from their father . <p> The boys had long wondered how a man with such hair got the nickname " Curly . " They 'd asked him once , at home , at the picnic table in the yard on a hot summer day when he sat drinking with Erv Hastings , a wanna-be mountain man who lived in the foothills of the Gospel Range , trapping in season , poaching off . Curly said Erv was a man 's man , coming down off the mountain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woodwork . <p> " Got the name from my long black curly eyelashes , " their father teased . <p> Erv leaned into the boys ' hearing . His breath smelled of beer and Frito-Lay 's . " Do n't you know ? Your daddy 's dick 's as curly as a pig 's tail . Drives women crazy . " <p> And then Erv was flopping back off the bench and Curly was on the man , dragging him off their property like a bad dog on a short leash . And of course they 'd believed it , what Erv said , because why else would you thrash someone unless he 'd given away your best secret ? For months after , they 'd marvel at the thought , try to get peeks of their father 's privates , inspect their own for a hint of the miraculous until one day their mother caught them at it , and they confessed . That night she made Curly show them his . " These fool boys will grow up twisting their dicks trying to live up to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced . It was straight and moderately sized . But in that , at least , it was n't his fault he was a disappointment . <p> Chuck took a break , walked with Joe around the back of the building , where Joe sat on upturned soda crates and Chuck perched atop an oil drum . They drank Cokes from cans . When Joe told about their mother and father 's affair , Chuck kicked the drum with his heels , the sound poinging across the lot . " Goddamn , " he said , " I 'm never getting married . " <p> Right now , handsome as he was , Chuck had the pick of girls , but Joe could warn him how in a town this small he 'd someday wake up to find them married away . All he 'd get was older as the girls got younger . He thought about Grace , wished last night had been better . <p> " Gripes , " Chuck said . " Mom 's fifty-five . Two men ? " He belched , sipped the Coke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic ? " He smiled at the thought . <p> " Get a handle , " Joe said . But maybe it was all genetic . Maybe they too were loose cannons knocking about in a small town , just waiting to be damaged . He thought about his father , the handsome younger man hauling logs . How he stayed sober on runs-he had that much restraint  --  but spent his weekends at home soured on beer . And there was some justification for it , after a week driving down mountain roads with twenty-five tons of logs chasing your heels . Joe 's mother treated her husband 's drinking like an occupational hazard . She tiptoed around him ; she collected the checks , bought the groceries , sobered him up , and always kissed him good-bye . Still , they quarreled endlessly . Which brought up the recent picture of them in a motel room-the bullheaded perversity of it all . " She 's got a husband , goddamn it . Whatever Curly used to be to her , it 's different now . She 's married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never could see what she saw . " " Like Dad 's such a catch ? " <p> " I mean , what do they talk about anyway ? " There was a sequence of strangled barks from the Pomeranian chained to the fence in the neighboring yard . Small dust devils chalked funnels across the gravel lot , and the sun spangled the fading chrome of a ' 52 Mercury gutted for parts . <p> " But Harold loves her , do n't you think ? " Joe asked . " And she married him-should n't that count for something ? " <p> " You could say the same for Dad . " Chuck kicked off the oil drum . " He must have loved her once . They had good times , even I remember . " " Barely , " Joe said . <p> " Remember that day Curly packed us all into his logging rig and we highballed it for the mountains ? " <p> " I remember that bench road up into the woods , and Ma whimpering in the cab . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he something ? " Chuck crushed the soda can under his heel and kicked it short of the dumpster . " But since she left him , it 's crazy-he quits drinking and goes to hell . Sits around all day . Sleeps mostly . " Chuck swiped at his hair . " Love 'll do that . Look at you . " He poked a finger in Joe 's stomach . " Put on ten pounds . Goddamn . " He shook his head , turned back toward the garage . " I ai n't never getting married . " <p> Sunday mornings they attended St. Stanislaus . It was n't so much that Joe believed in religion , but he believed in the effects of going to services . A certain moral culpability . Call it guilt . So he was religious about his attendance . Put up or shut up , he believed , and wrangled himself , Grace , and the children out of bed , hustled them in and out of the showers , warmed up the car . But no matter how hard he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely made it , processing up the aisle just ahead of the priest and altar boys , Maggie chirping and waving to her friends in the pews as though in a parade . <p> Today was no different , except the small church was full , so they had to walk the full length and around the front before they could clatter into a pew large enough to accommodate them . Bertha Wagner turned and shushed , flicking her rosary at them , beads like small , bloody hearts . She was a genteel old lady with a body too small for her name , whose husband Albert died setting choker twenty-three years ago in the Selway National Forest . He was forty-three years old-too old , they said after the accident . Setting choker took nerve and reflexes . " Nerves , " the men said , " he had plenty of , but at forty-three- " and their voices would drift off , like it was n't just a matter of when your number came up . <p> The priest faced the people , struck his breast : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been ten when Albert died . At the wake he sat in Albert 's yard with Curly and the other men while the women kept to the house , fixed food , applied cold compresses to Bertha 's neck . In the way of men , his father and friends drank , told jokes and stories about Albert , a man who had two left feet and would have been better born a grocer 's son than a logger 's . " It 's a wonder he made it this far , " someone said . " A blessed miracle , " said another . And they saluted the dead man again , and again , called him friend until the first stars turned from water to fire and crickets dirged in the weeds ; then the house lights grew warm , the windows levitating in the dark , and the men sat entranced , basking in friendship and their unspoken relief to be the ones left alive with whiskey , sooty as damp earth , on their tongues . And then , when they least expected it , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughter floating out into the night , and the men shuffled their feet , rolled their eyes at each other and looked quickly away , as though the laughter of women had exposed them there , huddled in the dark , bolted to the earth with hobnailed work shoes , and they took their leave , one by one melting into the dark , insubstantial as shadows . <p> The priest ascended the pulpit . Joe looked around and thought of the legions of widows , found himself wondering if they lived celibate lives . The old ones surely , surely . But what about Bertha , widowed at forty ? It ca n't have been easy . What did she do ? Hold a pillow to her stomach at night , pretend it was Albert , or did she quash her desire with bridge and the Cordwood Ladies ' Garden Club ? And then , unfortunately , he imagined Bertha wrapped in sheets on a motel bed , waiting , watching the door . Expectant . Her hair straggling over scrawny shoulders . <p> Bertha turned to stare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what he 'd been thinking , had caught him in church with her naked on his mind . But he could not let the picture go , Bertha strapping and lusting at forty , Bertha scrawny and still waiting in the motel at sixty-three . He thought to say something . Apologize . Undo the thing he 'd thought . But his lips stuck together . She shooed at him with her hands , and he realized he was still kneeling , his hands locked over the pew she was trying to sit against . He grunted an apology , slid back next to Grace , who was watching him carefully . <p> After mass he drove home slowly , stopped at the baker-bribery for the kids ' tolerable behavior in church . Schumacher 's Bakery . Emil , the son of German immigrants who 'd brought the Old World craft of brick-oven double-baked rolls , crullers , and kuchen to this Idaho backwater . His shop was manned by his four daughters , each as plump and sugared as the confections they fingered behind the glass-domed cabinets ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Three blocks from home , Grace dipped into the bag . The car smelled of sticky fruit-filling . Joe tugged at his tie , cracked the window . He could n't breathe deeply enough . " If I died , " he asked Grace , " would you remarry ? " <p> She caught a dollop of raspberry from Maggie 's roll in her palm , ran her tongue over the sweet concoction . " I hate this . This is one of those questions I ca n't win with . Next . " <p> " Well , look . You 're young . Beautiful . With two great kids . This is a small town , and pickings are slim . " He wished he and Grace were alone in the car . He wanted to pull her shirt up and spread her breasts with the sweet jam from her palms , now , in daylight , right out of church , say , This is mine , and this . Remind her , and make her forget every other man she 'd known or dreamed of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong way . He should weigh her down with children , sail her into the great unwashed masses of grocery boys with a belly like a schooner that no man , save her husband , would find desirable . " What say , " he whispered , " the kids go to the movies ? " <p> " You 're difficult to follow these days , Joe . What is it you want ? You want to marry me off after you 're dead , or send the kids to a movie ? " <p> Maggie perked up . " Movie , " she said . Ted seconded . <p> " Who 'll take them ? " she asked , then spit in a handkerchief and scrubbed Ted 's face while she had him captive . <p> " We 'll get a babysitter , " he said and winked . " I 'll pay for them all . " He felt generous . " Popcorn , soda , and jujubes . " <p> The kids yelled hooray and would not be calmed . But it was Sunday , and sitters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four stood outside the theater . Joe chafed in the sun while the children pressed their faces against the windows . There 'd be some small comfort in this if he and Grace could snuggle in the dark . But the children would sit between them , as always . She 'd dressed in shorts and a tank top ; the air conditioning in the old movie house had n't worked since the summer of ' 92 . A hot one that was . <p> Joe thought to beg out at the last moment , claim cramps , the onset of a cold , claustrophobia . But Grace would read through that , and he wondered if such insight was inherent in wives and mothers . As a child he 'd believed his mother had eyes in the back of her head . They were more intuitive , women . And as if to prove it , Grace gripped his hand in hers to keep him from bolting . Men , he decided , did n't have a chance . None of them . Not he , Chuck , or Curly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it 's Harold 's birthday Wednesday . We 're invited for cake and coffee . I told your mother we 'd come . " And he thought she smiled too widely . <p> They sat in the stretched shadows of cottonwoods and quaking aspen in Emmaline and Harold 's backyard . The light slanted over the yard , the town , the fields behind , and slipped from the face of the Gospels . Joe wore one of Emmaline 's damnable party hats . They all did , except Chuck , who refused on the ground that he might become the fool he looked . Joe 's hat had crepe-paper streamers spewing from the top that wafted into his drink , tinting the Dickel a violent purple . Harold 's hat had slipped over one eye , and he reclined awkwardly , feet launched off the end of the chaise tongue . He wore black socks and Bermuda shorts . There were blotches of color on his legs and hands : red , indigo , green . Joe wondered what duck he 'd been painting before being yanked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would corner him for an opinion . He hated that . What did he know about art ? Or ducks for that matter ? It never failed ; Joe would see one of the canvases , and something would seem . . . not right . But he could n't say what-a head too square , a wing too forward , the light too planned ? He busied himself tracking down Maggie 's shoes and socks and underwear . Maggie slumped , triumphant and naked yet again in her mother 's lap . <p> It was an embarrassment , being here , that he 'd tried to escape last night . He still flushed to think of it-just before bed , he 'd brought up the party . " Do we have to go ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , " she said . " I think so , do n't you ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said . " They 'd probably like an evening to themselves . " <p> " Coward , " she said . <p> He hated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend himself , which he always did badly . " Hey , " he said , " what am I supposed to think ? Harold 's got some lost ground to make up for . " <p> She 'd turned the light off then , with him standing in the bathroom door so he had to feel his way to bed . He did n't have to see her to know the stony stare fixed on her face . " You did n't used to be so cruel , " she said . She let out a sigh . <p> He knocked his knee on a bedpost , sucked breath between his teeth and muttered , " Shit . " <p> " This way , " she said . He heard a patting on the quilts . " Over here , " and then she was tucking him in like she did the kids , and it was comforting , even though his knee still throbbed . " What 's bothering you , hon ? " she asked . <p> As if she did n't know . " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her side . " If you 're the man I think you are , you 'll go , and you 'll handle it with grace and good sense , because you love your mother and your father and probably even Harold . " <p> And that was how women finally got you , believing you were more than you were . <p> And there was Emmaline , doting on her husband , pressing gifts into his hands : new sable brushes , crocheted slippers , a portable easel , a bottle of Canoe , a potted avocado . It would be amusing , Joe thought , if it were n't so reprehensible . Guilty conscience , no doubt . And then she was bringing out the cake , dazzling with sparklers instead of candles , and Harold oohed and aahed and slapped at the sparks swarming his legs like flaming bees , and then Joe was beating a path to the house while behind him he could hear the first choruses of Happy Birthday . <p> He entered through the kitchen , the most functional room-though the walls were frivolous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on a high shelf that ran the length of one wall was a march of cookie jars Emmaline had painted in ceramics class years ago : a cat , a cow , a rocking horse . And most hideous of all , a clown , whose hand-painted face , tearful even in the best of times , was rickracked with seams and yellowing glue-salvaged after one of Emmaline and Curly 's fights . <p> He turned into the wrong doorway and into Harold and Emmaline 's bedroom . His mother had brought most of their old possessions over-Grandma 's patchwork , the china knickknacks , a piping shepherd boy he 'd bought her when he was thirteen that sat like a junkyard derelict on the bedside table . There were pictures of his children , of him and Grace and Chuck . And over the bed , a framed portrait Harold had painted of Emmaline , which might have been flattering , except something was n't quite right-the jaw ? the ear ? the color ? <p> His mother stepped up behind him . " Are you all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , moving away . " A little too much to drink . I 've lost the bathroom again . " <p> " Yes , " she said , " I should n't worry . You 're all grown up now . " She seated herself on the bed , fiddled with the quilt . " You seen your dad lately ? " she asked . <p> He wondered if Grace had sent her . " Last week . He looked good . Maybe he 's getting over this . " His hands swept around the room . " Maybe he 's got someone of his own now , someone new . " <p> Emmaline settled her chin on her fist , smiled . " That would be nice , " she said . " He needs someone . He needs a good toss in the hay . " <p> That was the last straw . " You should know , " he said . <p> She nodded . " I know more about that man than you 'd ever dream . Spent a lot of years to get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't get me wrong , but the best of it is knowing another person that well . " <p> " I got to go , " Joe said , not wanting to hear the sordid details . <p> " Joe . " She twisted her hands in her lap . <p> And then he had the picture in his hand , and he flashed it in front of her face . " A good likeness , do n't you think ? " he asked , jerking a thumb at the portrait . <p> " It 's not what you think , " she said . <p> " That is so ... trite . " <p> " You 're acting like a wounded husband . " <p> " Which one ? " he asked . <p> She sighed , plumped one of the frilly pillows on the bed . " How did you ever grow up to be so damned self-righteous ? " <p> And he was out the door and down the hall and locked in the bathroom . He waited until he heard the back door swing open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood over the toilet and watched the clean water flush once , twice . He ran the faucet , rumpled the towels , listened to his wife 's footsteps approach and then fade back down the hall . He knew her walk . <p> In the yard again , Joe studied the carnage : wads of wrapping paper , abandoned drinks , cranky children wired on sugar , and the two women reclining on lounge chairs , seeming to float there in the half-light of dusk , patiently biding their time until the children drifted to sleep . He sidestepped a slice of white cake with pink frosting , marooned on the green grass . <p> Harold ambushed him on the back porch . He crooked his arp through Joe 's , whispered , " Come on , I want to show you something , " and so the new duck-stamp effort was about to be unveiled . <p> Joe shrugged off the arm . " Nothing personal . But I got to go . " He backed away . " Touch of flu . " He fled through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sidewalks by cutting through yards , feeling young again , a whip of a kid making his way as the crows did , heedless of fence and arbor , straight as a prayer . It was getting dark , and the last of the twilight eclipsed distances so that the Apostles appeared just a yard away , a darker slash of gray in the blank gray air , and he looked down at his hands , his trousers , and how the color had leached from them in this static time between sun and lamplight , and he could be anything , he thought , to those watching from windows , just another piece of the gray : a shrub , a dog , a quirk in their vision . He hurdled the Rambolts ' shrub , throwing himself at the threefoot hedge on wet grass in dress shoes with slick bottoms so that he landed with a skid , his torso twisting , his ankle bobbling , and he stumbled down to a knee . <p> He stayed that way , listening to the nattering of a squirrel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ricochet from ankle to shin , but there was only the wet , green stain on his bended knee . He walked the remaining half-block to his childhood home , where he let himself in the back gate . He stood in the shadow of the ponderosa pine , a lofty veteran of three failed tree houses , the ground beneath it pillowed with duff and needles . Gnats drifted beneath the canopy , spun willy-nilly with the air currents , and from beneath the tree 's umbrella , Joe watched the house . The curtains were drawn wide , glass glazed with twilight  --  the last hue of sky , slate now , unreadable . The back door opened , and there stood Curly . <p> Any minute now , Joe would call out . Call to his father , call him into account , flash the photo in front of his face , say , " This . This . .. " <p> What ? <p> Should have been enough , years ago ? Some accountability was required for the mess Curly 'd made of their lives , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to be made the fool in the name of love . How much room did a heart have to afford ? As if he heard those thoughts , Joe 's father looked to the dark patch under the pine where Joe stood concealed , and then his attention wandered to the far corner of the yard . Perhaps it was a function of distance , or poor lighting , but his father looked smaller , diminished . Joe felt startled that it should hurt so much . He wished he 'd gone home . Wished he 'd been there to greet Grace , tuck the children into bed . Better to view Harold 's new canvas , some wedge-winged , off-kilter duck . Better to have stayed than to stand here an intruder on familiar grounds . <p> Crickets rustled in the weeds , taking up the first chirps of evening . It felt as if they 'd been standing here , he and his father , forever . Children were called indoors , and dogs rallied to the rising moon ; a clear blue light fell over the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The neighboring yards settled into shadows while bats limbered in the eaves and lights nipped on in kitchens and parlors . It was a grand shuffling indoors . Joe 's favorite time of the day , when chores were done and babies asleep , when his wife invited herself into his lap and talk was given over to the solace of familiar flesh . Joe 's feet felt numb in his shoes , but still he held watch until he thought his blood would silt downward and he would be rooted beneath this tree , to this yard , as all his history had failed to do . He heard his father sigh . He saw his father lean across the porch railing , his face turning upward and then his body following , lifting to his toes , suspended , as if he wished to ascend with the moon . The shank of black hair shone , catching the reflected light , and that all-forgiving moon made his face a young man 's again . Joe felt something in himself become buoyant , as though a space had opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could clamp his heart shut against what intruded , he could not . And then Curly was solid on his feet , and , opening the door , he swung it wide and held it , as if to call in his wife or his lovely sons from the boughs of pines , as if to loose these vast regrets into the night . <p>
