Chapter One December 13 dawned bright and sunny , unseasonably warm according to the morning nurse . Sarah did n't mind . Temperatures in South Carolina could change in an afternoon , and snow was n't out of the question . Even for the week ahead . Snow had been a part of their first December ; it was bound to come sometime in the next twelve days . Beth Baldwin was in charge that morning . Beth was a young caregiver who never spoke more than the essentials . Good morning . How are you ? Nice December we 're having . That sort of thing . Beth was married , or at least Sarah suspected as much since Beth wore a wedding ring . She was a pretty girl , a gentle caregiver , but her eyes were wild and restless . They reminded Sarah of something she could n't quite take hold of . " Beth , dear , do you know what day it is ? " Sarah leaned forward so Beth could ease her into her red Christmas sweater . The young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice was pleasant , but she did n't make eye contact . " Monday , December 13 . " A soft chuckle came from Sarah 's throat . " No , dear . I do n't mean the date , I mean the one hand on her hip . " I give up ; what 's special about today ? " " Why , it 's the First Day of Christmas ! " Beth cocked her head . " You mean like the song ? The partridge in a pear tree and all that Twelve Days of Christmas stuff ? " " Yes . " Sarah tugged on the sides of her sweater , and when it lay smooth around her scant frame , she eased back against the pillow . " Today 's the first day . " " Hmmm . " Beth took hold of the water pitcher sitting on Sarah 's bedside table . " I thought those were the twelve days after Christmas . " " Only in the history books , dear . My twelve days begin today . " " Oh . " Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With purposeful steps , she went to the sink , rinsed the pitcher , filled it , and returned it to its place . " I guess that means one thing . " She stopped and gave Sarah a lopsided smile . " Twelve shopping days until Christmas . " Sarah pursed her lips , the prayer from last night playing over in her mind . Beth was n't the one ; she would n't hold a conversation , never mind listen to a story that stretched over twelve days . " You know the routine . " Beth headed for the door with a glance over her shoulder . " Press the call button if you need anything . " " Thank you , Beth . I 'll be okay for a few- " She was gone . Sarah stared at the closed door and gave a gentle shrug of her shoulders . Just as well . If Beth was n't the one she 'd prayed for , better to be alone for the first day of the ritual . She 'd been waiting for this moment since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelopes lay fanned out on her nightstand in numerical order , the small plastic tree set up a few inches away , pressed against the wall . Sarah shifted to that side of the bed and let her legs hang over the side until her woolly socks rested on the cold linoleum floor . The first envelope called out to her , begging to be opened . She lifted the flap , removed the paper ornament , and studied the word scrawled across both sides . Tomorrow . That 's what she had wanted that cold January day , was n't it ? Everything about tomorrow . Today , what she had in the moment , was never enough . Not Greer or her parents or their faith . Not even Sam . Everything she 'd done back then was focused on tomorrow , that far-off day when she could go after everything country music had to offer . Everything a young woman with her looks and voice and determination deserved . Everything her small town of Greer could n't offer . Every moment of it . Tomorrow . Sarah studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit the piped-in music , the conversations in the hall , the aches and pains of nearly nine decades , all grew dim . She closed her eyes , and in a rush she felt herself going back , pulled into a time that still existed , a time that had never really ended at all . She blinked her eyes open , and she was no longer perched on the edge of her bed at Greer Retirement Village . She was twenty-three , in her parents ' farmhouse across the street from the high school . Her mother was canning in the kitchen and the smell of warm apples and cinnamon filled the air . It was Christmas Eve 1940 , and Sam Lindeman was over . The way Sam always had been back then . Sarah fingered the paper ornament in her hand and blinked . She felt the weathered skin above her eyebrows bunch up and she pulled herself from the memory . She could n't start in 1940 . No , she had to go back to her girlhood days , when she dreamed day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day marrying him . Sam was five years older than her , the brother of Sarah 's best friend , Mary . Though the Lindemans sometimes vacationed with Sarah 's family , Sam never noticed Sarah in the early years . His age stood like an ocean , the span of time too far to consider bridging . But sometime after her twelfth birthday , despite their age difference , Sarah fell hard for him . " He 's so cute , " she would tell Mary whenever the two were visiting . Back then , they spent hours listening to records in Mary 's room , pretending they were famous singers . " Nah , " Mary would wrinkle her nose and turn up the music . " He 's just my bossy brother . " Sam played football for Greer High and Sarah used to dream of aging four years overnight , waking one morning , showing up at the high school , and being Sam Lindeman 's girl . They would graduate high school and head for some foreign land-Spain , maybe , or the South of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers were always talking about . In the dream , Sam would lead tourists on daring excursions and she would gain fame and fortune singing-not in a church choir the way her mother wanted her to sing , but in fancy dance halls and nightclubs , decked in beautiful gowns , with Sam sitting in the front row smiling at her . The dream never panned out . Every morning Sarah woke up still twelve years old , and the next year Sam graduated from high school and went off to college without so much as a good-bye to his kid sister 's little friend . Years passed , and Sarah kept singing . By the time she turned seventeen everyone in Greer knew about her gift . She 'd been born with a voice that could silence a room ; a voice her mama said would make angels cry with envy . Sarah proved it again and again , every Sunday when the church choir featured her as a soloist . Each week Sarah smiled and sang her heart out . But she hated singing in a choir robe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted down the days until she could finish high school and take her singing somewhere exciting-Nashville or New York or Chicago . Anywhere but Greer . One summer Sam returned home for an entire month . Four years had passed since Sam left for college , and he no longer figured into Sarah 's dreams . Sarah would never forget the first time she saw him that July day . That morning at the Lindeman house , she was on her way up the stairs to find Mary when she heard a man 's voice call to her from the dining room . She turned and there he was . Sam Lindeman , twenty-two years old , taller , more filled out and more handsome than she had remembered . Sarah 's breath caught in her throat and she froze near the bottom of the stairs . Visions of Spain and France and the Bahamas flashed in her mind . " Sarah , look at you . " He crossed the parlor to the place where she stood . His voice fell a notch and his eyes seemed to find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl down the street ? " " Uh ... " Heat rushed into Sarah 's cheeks and she remembered to smile . " I grew up . " She batted her eye-lashes , willing herself to exhale . " I guess so . " He leaned against the wall , watching her . " You must be , what , seventeen now ? " " Yes . " She was breathing again , but her racing heart threatened to give her away . " I 'll be a senior in the fall . " " You 're beautiful . I almost did n't recognize you . " " Gosh , " Sarah lowered her chin , suddenly shy . " Thanks . I mean ... I guess we both grew up , huh ? " " Yeah . " He was quiet for a moment , a smile playing at the corners of his lips . " Can I ask you something , little Sarah all grown up ? " She giggled and felt some of her confidence return . " Ask . " " I 'm taking my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true as time , and her knees grew weak again . " Wan na come ? " Sarah did n't have to think about her answer . " Yes " was out of her mouth almost as soon as he finished asking . Her parents would n't mind ; not if Mary was going along . Besides , Sarah chided herself , Sam was n't interested in her . He was only being nice , probably wanting to catch up on the past four years . That night they bowled before dinner and Sam entertained them with hilarious stories about his roommates back at college . Later , halfway through the meal , conversation turned to Sam 's plans after college . Travel , Sarah expected him to say . Exploration and adventure and daring , the sort of life that long ago she had dreamed they 'd share together . Instead , he set his burger down and leaned forward . " I 'm getting my teaching certificate and coming back home . " His eyes held a new sort of knowing as they found hers . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach in Greer . Be the principal one day . " He shifted his attention back to his sister . " That 's all I 've ever wanted . Sooner the better . " Once more he looked at her . " How about you , Sarah ? What are you doing after high school ? " Sarah 's head was still spinning from his answer . " I 'm leaving Greer , getting a recording contract . " " Really ? " His expression held a hint of amusement . " Someone told me you could sing . " " She 's amazing . " Mary ate a French fry and nodded hard . " One day everyone will know Sarah . " " That 's the plan . " Sarah tried to find an appropriate laugh to help keep the conversation light , but none was available . Instead she excused herself . Alone in the restroom she stared at the chipped mirror , her eyes wide . Marrying a local girl right out of college was one thing , but Sam Lindeman living and teaching in Greer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Al 's Drive-In or family night at the library ? She shuddered and fear took a stab at her composure . As a girl she 'd dreamed of following Sam to the ends of the earth , and now that he was home , now that he 'd finally noticed her , those feelings were coming to life again . But she never imagined the dream would take her no farther than the Greer city limit sign . A mix of emotions competed for control inside her . She was in trouble . Not because of the way Sam had looked at her when he talked about his future , but because of the way her heart leapt within her when he did . ( Continues ... )
