No matter how well they pout and grin , there 's one thing all child actors have to be able to do : relax . If you place an ordinary kid opposite Mel Gibson or Susan Sarandon and yell " action , " he 'll get as stiff and shaky as a screen door in a gale . Rory and Kieran Culkin , younger brothers of Home Alone star Macaulay , do n't know from stiff . In this month 's Igby Goes Down , in which they play the same prep-school rebel at different points in his life , they seem as at ease on camera as most people are on their couch . <P> Rory , 13 , who plays Gibson 's son in the sci-fi blockbuster Signs , sits down for lunch at a fancy Manhattan restaurant and promptly chugs a can of Red Bull energy drink . He then asks his mother to leave , sticks the lemon wedge from her Coke in his mouth and assumes an amiable but bored expression . Interviews , he makes clear , are not scary .

" <P> Kieran , 19 , is even less daunted . Over Cokes at the same restaurant , different day , he does n't come off as egotistical or spoiled , just brash . Burr Steers , who directed Igby , in which Kieran stars with Sarandon , likes to recount how he bagged the part : " Kieran comes skipping in and takes one look at me and says , ' You look like s .

" He had rings under his eyes , so yeah , I guess I told him he looked like s , " Kieran says . He shrugs . Business as usual . <P> Kieran and Rory are unusual actors in that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sets of Macaulay 's movies . " I was n't trying to learn from them . I just kind of knew what to do from them , " says Rory . " I grew up on a set , basically . " Kieran , who was old enough to play a small part in 1990 's Home Alone , went through the same immersion . According to Steers , that experience produced a distinctive style . " They do n't realize how technically skilled they are . You do n't see the acting , the seams in their work , " he says . That 's why they 're so good . In their films , they look like real kids shuffling through normal ups and downs : when Kieran , as Igby , gets the news that his inheritance will be small , or when Rory informs Gibson he had to kill the family dog , it 's easy to forget you 're watching drama and not something like real life . <P> Kieran 's childhood had plenty of real drama .
