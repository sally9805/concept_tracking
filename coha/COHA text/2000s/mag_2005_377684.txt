We 're barreling along in Act II of Berlioz 's The Trojans . Troy is in flames . The Greeks are rampaging . As conductor John Eliot Gardiner whips the orchestra to a boil , the prophetess Cassandra ( Anna Caterina Antonacci ) soars into an aria of despair and defiance , urging the other Trojan women to kill themselves . But hold on . Let 's take a moment to hear how director Yannis Kokkos sees this scene . ( Cassandra 's " vision of fatality , " he says , achieves for Troy " a kind of revenge by immolation . " ) Next , let 's cut to Gardiner . ( Conducting this music , he says , is " so deeply moving because Berlioz does everything that the conductor needs for him . " ) O.K. Now back to the battle . <P> That is what it 's like to experience an opera the DVD way  --  in this case , on a three-disc set released by BBC/Opus Arte . And we have n't even mentioned the surround sound , the subtitles in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a click or two away on your remote . No wonder conductor James Levine says that of all recording technologies , " this medium is , up to now , the best . DVD gives a really amazing , thrilling and altogether remarkable result . " <P> Classical-music lovers seem to agree . DVDs are n't yet as big a factor as classical CDs , which themselves represent only 3% of the overall recorded-music market ; but allowing for the fact that they are a fraction of a sliver , DVDs are gaining fast and showing great potential . " They 've put a jump start in the aspect of the business that needed it , " says Christopher Roberts , president of Universal Classics and Jazz International . <P> Precise figures are hard to come by , but Tower Records , the nation 's largest independent music retailer , reports that since September , classical-DVD sales have been running at least 12% ahead of the previous year 's , whereas classical-CD sales in the same period have been more or less flat . With DVD players now in 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-quality speakers or surround sound to their entertainment systems , the appeal of DVDs can only grow . <P> Because they are highly visual , operas and ballets are naturals for DVD , but instrumental music is selling strongly too . " In today 's times , " says Dennis Hedlund , chairman of Kultur International Films , " because of TV , the computer , all the technology , people would rather see their favorite artists perform . " What can be seen has grown more interesting as well . Many of the video releases of 20 or 30 years ago were shot with a single , fixed camera and suffered from grainy images and muddy sound . They were also more expensive than audio recordings . Today 's DVDs  --  often drawn from elaborate television productions and documentaries  --  offer multiple camera angles , crystalline images and superb sound . And they tend to cost $20 to $40 , still somewhat pricier than CDs , but they are getting more competitive all the time . <P> Nor do DVD producers shrink from a whopping price tag if the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerts with the New York Philharmonic , a series that was a milestone of cultural-TV programming between 1958 and 1973 , has been released by Kultur as a nine-disc , 25-hr. - long set .
