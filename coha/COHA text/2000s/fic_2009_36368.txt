1 <p> Come to me . <p> Frightened , Eduardo Leblanc shook his head within the diving helmet , the way a dog would shake water from its fur  --  trying to rid himself of the voice inside his skull . <p> Far below the surface of the Caribbean Sea , he had lost contact with the salvage ship , the Declan . The communication unit on his diving helmet had malfunctioned . He had been listening to an exchange between Krantz  --  the crew 's marine archeologist , the only other diver down on this shift  --  and the ship . Suddenly the comm unit cut out , and Eduardo heard nothing other than the exhaust of bubbles from his helmet and the usual soft noises of his equipment . <p> He looked over at Krantz . Krantz was in charge here , supervising the underwater recovery work they were doing on the Morgan Bray , an American merchant ship that had sunk in 1815 . The light for video equipment on the archeologist 's helmet was on , as was Eduardo 's . As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the faceplate of Krantz 's mask , Eduardo could see he was still speaking to the ship , or at least narrating what his camera was seeing . <p> Come to me , and all will be well . <p> This was the second time Eduardo had heard the voice . The same thing had happened on his first dive in these waters , two days ago . The communications device cut out . He heard the voice . He felt afraid , and then  --  then the fear changed . Now Eduardo 's fear once again began to give way to a sense of anticipation . He looked anxiously between Krantz and a small mound of sand a few feet away , one among many that undoubtedly covered artifacts from the Morgan Bray . <p> He checked the connector for the communications cable hookup on his air hat  --  the model was one of the finest available to commercial divers  --  to ensure that nothing was loose . As he expected , all attachments were secure , although nothing he did brought the transmissions back . He looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readied for this dive , he told himself that he had only imagined the strange sensations he felt two days ago , and that certainly the voice he had heard was not real . He blamed the experience on a lack of sleep , thought of it as a hallucination  --  they were not unknown in this profession . The voice was inside his head , and not being heard over the system , or anywhere outside his own skull . <p> Now he heard it again , and turned back to the mound of sand among the scattered wreckage , feeling quite sure that this was the place the voice wanted him to be . With every passing moment , he felt better about his decision to heed its call . The nearer he came to the mound , the greater his sense of calm contentment . Why had he ever worried about the voice ? <p> The comm unit suddenly came back online , and the archeologist , who had never treated Eduardo as anything but a mule in a diving suit , asked , in a tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was supposed to be working . <p> The voice fed him his lines . <p> Tell him , " My talking apparatus failed again . " <p> Eduardo heard himself effortlessly translate this odd phrase to his own wording . " My comm unit went out again , " he said . <p> Krantz frowned . " That 's dangerous  --  " <p> Tell him , " It seems to be working now . " <p> " It seems to be working now , " he heard himself echo . <p> Keep him happy , do your work . Come back to me when it is one hour before the time to begin your ascent . I am about to make you wealthy and more powerful than you have ever been in your life . <p> This now seemed entirely reasonable to Eduardo . He moved away from the mound and he and the archeologist continued their survey work , Krantz ordering him about as usual , until it was an hour before the time for the next team to take a shift . When the next prompting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walk back to the mound , Eduardo obeyed without hesitation . <p> " Eduardo ! " Krantz said impatiently . <p> Eduardo looked back at him . A blank look came over Krantz 's face , then he turned and went back to work on recovering what appeared to be a ship 's bell . <p> He wo n't bother you now , the voice said . Listen carefully , Eduardo , and I 'll ensure he never bothers you again . <p> Eduardo 's radio went out again . <p> Eduardo decided that the breakdown of the comm unit was n't such a bad thing . It was really great not hearing the ship give him orders . Being bossed around was no more fun underwater than it was on the surface . <p> Later he would wonder why he failed to perceive that the voice in the sea was far more commanding than any of his supervisors ' voices . Right now , it did n't seem so much to be ordering him as coaxing him . <p> Do you want what I offer ? Riches beyond imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visions arose . He suddenly saw himself surrounded by beautiful women , pictured himself driving up to a mansion in a luxury car . He saw himself being treated differently , not as a menial laborer , dismissed as a young fool , but as an important person , someone others made way for , someone they admired . <p> Do you want these things ? Truly want them ? Do you have the courage to take what is before you , or will you live your whole life regretting that you failed to take this opportunity ? I offer you the ability to move in the first circles of society . A life of leisure . The wealth to buy jewels , horses , land  --  to dress in nothing but the finest clothing . Do you want these , and other pleasures you dare not even dream of now ? Say yes , Eduardo . Say yes . <p> Eduardo vaguely noted that the voice 's accent was British . He frowned . Working in the Caribbean , Eduardo had been around plenty of Englishmen , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met before . Even the accent did n't explain how strange his words were , or why it was that when the voice said " horses , " Eduardo thought of race cars . <p> " Who are you ? " Eduardo asked . " Are you the devil ? " <p> Eduardo heard a soft laugh . No , I 'm not the devil . Think of me as someone who was cheated , and needs your help to regain what is rightfully his own . I am willing to reward you handsomely for your help . <p> Eduardo felt a little easier , hearing that . But he asked , " If you 're not the devil , then who are you ? What 's your name ? " <p> If you insist on a name  --  I have most recently been known as Adrian , Lord Varre . <p> Immediately the thought came to Eduardo that he must never call this being Adrian . He must address him as " my lord . " <p> Indeed ! Now say , " Yes , my lord , I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this was all a hallucination , then what harm would it do to follow it through , as one would in a dream ? And if not  --  he suddenly imagined one of the other divers saying yes to the voice , someone else getting all the wealth . His wealth . His race cars . <p> Riches , Eduardo . Think of going back home and showing them how well you 've done for yourself . <p> It did not occur to Eduardo to ask how the voice knew this secret wish of his . <p> " Yes , my lord , I agree to become your servant , " he said . <p> He waited for lightning to strike , even here on the floor of the sea . He braced himself , expecting Satan to appear before him , to tell him that he was going straight to hell . Instead , he heard only the soft sounds of the sea and his own equipment . Gradually , he was filled with a sense of well-being . Everything would be fine . He had nothing to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object . I will help to ensure that no one knows you have taken it . <p> A few hours ago , he would have immediately pointed out all the reasons why it was impossible for him to do such a thing . Now he listened carefully as the voice gave him instructions . Eduardo could no more resist reaching to uncover the object beneath the mound of sand than he could resist his own heartbeat . <p> The object proved to be a small metal chest , crisscrossed with thick , rusty bands of iron and bearing two heavy locks . He felt excitement , sure that whoever had carried the casket aboard the Morgan Bray had stored something extremely valuable within it  --  jewels , most likely . <p> No , I 'm afraid you wo n't find anything but ashes within , so for the time being this chest must remain sealed . Place it in the canvas bag attached to your belt . <p> Eduardo did as he was commanded . A sensation of pure bliss came to him . He felt overwhelmed by it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were drugged . <p> Now , I 'm going to call some of my friends to help us . You must not be afraid  --  whatever slight harm they do to you will not be painful , and will merely ensure that others are distracted . For your part , you must help the other man to ascend to the surface . <p> Eduardo blinked , and the dazed sensation dropped away . He was startled as the comm unit suddenly started working again  --  a shipmate calling frantically , " Do you read me ? " <p> " Yes , " Eduardo answered , " just came back online . I 've been having trouble with my comm unit . " <p> " Krantz told us that , but  --  " <p> " Yes , his is working . " <p> " No , it 's not ! Not for the last few minutes . I 've just been getting static . Are you guys okay ? " <p> " I 'm fine . Let me check on Krantz  --  he 's not facing me . " <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a daze . By now the captain had come online . <p> " Begin your ascent , " he ordered them . " I do n't want you working down there until we get this communications problem straightened out . " <p> So they began their careful rise toward the surface , halting as needed to avoid decompression problems . <p> " Can you hear me ? " the captain asked when they had nearly started their last stage of the ascent . <p> " Yes , sir , " Eduardo answered when there was no response from Krantz . <p> " I guess Krantz 's equipment is out again . We 've lost the cameras , too . " <p> " We 're almost ready to surface , sir , " Eduardo said . <p> " Get Krantz 's attention . " <p> Eduardo reached out to the other diver and saw that although Krantz was breathing and his eyes were open , he seemed unaware of his surroundings . <p> " I think he may be in trouble , sir . " Eduardo described Krantz 's condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain said . " Bring him up as soon as you can safely do so . I 'll have Doc waiting for you . " <p> Do n't be afraid , the voice said . You 're about to have a little company . You must leave my friends unharmed . They 're just going to help us with a distraction . <p> " Company ? " Eduardo said . <p> " Say again ? " the captain said . <p> But now Eduardo had seen large gray and white shapes swimming strongly toward them . <p> " We 've got company , " he managed to say , although his mouth was dry . It took all his will to resist pulling out his speargun . <p> " Say again ? " the captain repeated . <p> " Tiger sharks . Two of them circling us now . " <p> They came close , close enough for Eduardo to see their small eyes , their wide snouts . Both were well over twice his own size . He guessed the largest one to be about fourteen feet in length . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Stay calm . You know they may just be curious . Let go of Krantz if you need to defend yourself  --  we can pull him up . " He heard the captain giving orders to other men . <p> He reached the surface without harm , and was just about to hand Krantz off to the waiting crew when the sharks struck . One bit hard into Krantz 's calf , causing Krantz to come out of his stupor with a scream . A moment later , Eduardo cried out in pain as well , feeling sharp teeth stab into his shoulder . The bite released , and a new wave of agony shot through him as strong hands hauled him up from the water . <p> Chaos reigned on deck . He nearly passed out as the crew worked to remove his equipment . It was soon seen that Krantz 's injury was far worse , and while one crew member held a pressure bandage to Eduardo 's wound , the doctor went to work to help the archeologist . He felt himself go into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his thoughts began to clear , the first of them was directed at the voice : You tricked me . <p> He waited for a response , even wondered if he had indeed hallucinated the whole thing , but then a reply came to him . <p> Tricked you ? Not at all . Your wound will heal . For reasons you will come to understand later , it would not do for you to come out of the attack unscathed . Quickly now , hide the collection bag beneath that bench to your right . Trust me to keep the others occupied  --  and remember , you have pledged your obedience to me . <p> He considered resisting , considered arguing , but he wanted the chest to himself , so he did as he was told . As he started to reach for the bag , Krantz began thrashing about on the deck , and even the man who was holding the bandage against his shoulder abandoned him to help with Krantz . No one saw him stash the bag among the life vests stowed beneath the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice said . Soon we will leave this ship together . I will show you where to find riches , and you will help me to find a man named Tyler Hawthorne . <p> Eduardo lost consciousness . <br> <p> Three days later , as the Declan lay in dock , the captain gave Eduardo Leblanc the pay he had earned , and a substantial bonus as well . He had tried to persuade the young man not to give up diving  --  he believed Eduardo had a talent for the work . But he understood completely . A shark attack was a rare occurrence , but he could hardly expect Eduardo not to fear it . In truth  --  and quite understandably  --  Eduardo had n't been himself since the attack . <p> " Doc said your wound is healing remarkably well , " the captain said , " and that you should n't have any trouble from it in the future . But  --  there 's always more to something like this than the injury itself , of course . If there 's anything more I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eduardo said . " I 'll be fine . I appreciate all you 've done for me , but I need to move on . " <p> The captain fell silent . He had taken Eduardo under his wing , but he was n't the kid 's father , after all . Perhaps he would be fine . " What will you do now ? " <p> " Oh , I 'll keep looking for treasure  --  I 'm just going to look for it on land . " <p> The captain smiled . " I wish you luck . But if you fail to find it , you can always get a job with Declan Salvage . " <p> Eduardo thanked him again . <p> As he watched him go , the captain sighed and shook his head . Young men could be such fools . Copyright 2009 by Jan Burke <br> Continues ...
