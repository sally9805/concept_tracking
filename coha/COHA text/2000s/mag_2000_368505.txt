Back in 1867 , William Whitaker was just one of many well-bred Bostonians building a luxurious town house in a neighborhood straight out of Victorian England . Today , with their mansard roofs , double front doors , bay windows and rear gardens , these South End buildings are preserved by landmark rules . Some have been reclaimed as single-family houses , others are apartments , but the 21st century Whitaker House is a bed-and-breakfast owned by Martin Gottlieb and John Collette . <P> The grandest of the three bedrooms , the Victorian Room , with its 12-ft. ceilings , was once the rear parlor . A king-size four-poster mahogany bed sits in front of a working marble fireplace ; a bay window overlooks a landscaped garden . All the rooms have lush Oriental rugs , original details and antique furnishings . <P> Every morning Gottlieb and Collette provide a breakfast of fruits , cereals and freshly baked scones , which can be enjoyed either in the kitchen or outdoors on the patio . There is also a comfortable parlor in which guests can pour themselves a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more soothing than having Tucker , the golden retriever , nearby ? <P> Outside , Victorian Boston and the 21st century city meet . The Prudential Center and John Hancock Building tower above the town houses . The neighborhood offers plenty of dining options , from French bistro to French Cambodian .
