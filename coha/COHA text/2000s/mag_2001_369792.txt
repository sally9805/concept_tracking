VAUGHN MEADER JOHN F. KENNEDY <P> His Presidential Experience It was more a characterization than an impression . I did n't buffoon it . It was authentic and responding to the news and social events as much as to the President . <P> The White House Response I heard that Arthur Schlesinger heard a press conference I was doing on the radio and thought it was J.F.K. He panicked , and after that the White House was a little cool to what I was doing . But it took off , so J.F.K. portrayed himself as a good-natured , self-deprecating kind of guy . He put up a good front ... But Jackie really did not care for it . <P> RICH LITTLE RICHARD M. NIXON <P> His Presidential Experience Any child of five could do Nixon . He was the most visual of the Presidents ... He had definite arm movements , a definite way of walking , he was very uncoordinated , very flat-footed , walked like he never took the hanger out of the coat ... Nixon , like Clinton , wrote itself from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more controversy  --  the more comedy . <P> The White House Response I once sat next to a gentleman on a plane who knew Nixon well . He swore that Nixon thought my routines were funny , got a kick out of them . Once I did Nixon in front of him and Nixon did n't realize it was him . <P> CHEVY CHASE GERALD R. FORD <P> His Presidential Experience The issue is n't how you look doing the impression ; it 's the writing . It 's easy to get cheap laughs , but I like laughs on the political front that might have an effect . <P> The White House Response Ford was very remarkable in the way he treated me ; he never once complained . I remember thinking , " I ought to be somewhat more gentle . " But I was a liberal Democrat at the time . I cared very much about getting Ford out and Carter in . <P> DANA CARVEY GEORGE BUSH <P> His Presidential Experience The trick is to exaggerate and extend it to a complete acidhead rendition and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Once I convinced the audience that Bush really sounded like that , I knew I could do anything . Most of what I did was completely made up  --  so go figure . <P> The White House Response President Bush was always a big fan . He invited me to the White House after he was defeated . He said , " Why do n't you do that for me , right here , right now . " I was nervous , I said , " Well , it 's really not very good . " He said , " Do it . Do it now . " So I had to do it ; it was kind of humiliating . Every time I saw him , he would say , " Would n't be prudent . " It is hilarious that the President of the United States was doing his impression back to me . <P>  --  Reported by Elizabeth L. Bland and Lina Lofaro
