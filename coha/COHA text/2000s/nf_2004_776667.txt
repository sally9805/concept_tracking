MIGRATION // The sharp cries of gulls wheeling above the East River docks welcomed the handsome young Frenchman to America . Crossing from Nantes in late summer , he had been a month and a half at sea and he was grateful for the solidity of New York cobblestones . That August 1803 he was four months past his eighteenth birthday , barely fledged , but the United States was hardly older : Lewis and Clark were just preparing to depart for the West . His father owned a plantation called Mill Grove on Perkiomen Creek near its junction with the Schuylkill River northwest of Philadelphia , close above Valley Forge , and that was where he was going . His father was a former sea captain and retired French Navy officer who had commanded a corvette in the final battle of the American Revolution . Jean Audubon had sent his cherished only son to America to escape conscription into the forces Napoleon was mustering for his war with England , joined the previous May . // Wherever the young man went he watched the birds . Birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large freedom they lived rich lives in parallel with people and people hardly knew . On his passage from Nantes , at the Grand Banks off Newfoundland where his ancestors had fished for cod , far out at sea , he had scattered ship 's biscuit on the deck and drawn migrating brown titlarks ( American pipits ) * down from the heavens to feed . " They came on board wearied , " he would remember and write thirty years later , " and so hungry that the crumbs of biscuit thrown to them were picked up with the greatest activity . " // He studied birds for the fables they enacted-he carried La Fontaine 's Fables with him as a guide-and beyond fable he studied them to learn their habits , the patterns and systems of their lives . Studying birds was how he mastered the world , and himself . Leaving his friends , his father and his country had disheartened him . The long hours of sailing brought " deep sorrow or melancholy musing . . . . My affections were with those I had left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then the New World rolled across the horizon , a real and physical wilderness beyond its settled rim . He had begun drawing birds in France . Now , " prompted by an innate desire to acquire a thorough knowledge of the birds of this happy country , I formed the resolution , immediately on my landing , to spend , if not all my time in that study , at least all that portion generally called leisure , and to draw each individual of its natural size and coloring . " This is retrospect , of course , but it catches the eighteen-year-old 's excitement and bravado . // His name-his new name , his name as of the day he had boarded ship-was John James Audubon . In France for the previous ten years he had been Jean-Jacques Foug ? re Audubon . ( Foug ? re- " fern " - was an offering to placate the Revolutionary authorities , who scorned the names of saints . ) From his birth on April 26 , 1785 , until 1793 he had been Jean Rabin , his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar plantation on Saint Domingue ( soon to be renamed Haiti ) to a twenty-seven-year-old French chambermaid , Jeanne Rabin , who had died of infection within months of his birth . His father 's wife in France , Anne Moynet , a generous older widow whom Jean Audubon had married long before , had welcomed her husband 's natural son to Nantes and raised him as her own , but his stigmatic birth was a secret John James was sworn to hide : in France bastard children were denied inheritance . // To complicate his identity further , he began using the name LaForest , enlarging on Foug ? re : John James LaForest Audubon. // He was taller than the average of his day , lean and athletic , unself-consciously vain : // I measured five feet , ten and one half inches , was of fair mien , and quite a handsome figure ; large , dark , and rather sunken eyes , light-colored eyebrows , aquiline nose and a fine set of teeth ; hair , fine texture and luxuriant , divided and passing down behind each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Five feet nine is nearer the truth-taller than his father , who was five feet five . His hair was chestnut , his beak of a nose certifiably French . But without question women found him handsome . " He is the handsomest boy in Nantes , " his adoptive mother had written her husband once , " but perhaps not the most studious . " // He could sing , dance , play the flute , the violin and the recorder-like flageolet , fence , hunt , shoot and ride and draw . He was volatile , excitable and vivacious . Young as he was , people already liked to be around him-men and women both . // Before he could learn American birds he had to learn English . His father had asked the captain of his ship of passage , John Smith , to watch over him . Leaving the ship to cash the letter of credit his father had given him , striding along Greenwich Street above the Battery , John James was staggered by the first symptoms of a life-threatening fever . He remembered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jaundicing and frequently deadly infection was a common summer scourge . In 1793 an epidemic that refugees had carried from Saint Domingue had killed nearly five thousand people in Philadelphia , and it had struck again that summer of 1803 in New York as well . Illness made Smith 's mission imperative . The captain saw his charge delivered to a boardinghouse outside Philadelphia operated by two good Quaker women and left him in their care . Nursing him back to health , the women taught him Quaker English . He thee 'd and thou 'd his intimates ever after . // when john james 's nurses thought he was well enough to travel , they sent word to his father 's agent in Philadelphia , and soon a prosperous Quaker lawyer carriaged to their boardinghouse to fetch the young man away . Miers Fisher had negotiated the purchase of Mill Grove for Jean Audubon in 1789 . Twenty-three hundred English pounds in gold and silver-roughly $200,000 today-bought 284 acres of fair Pennsylvania farmland and woods with a two-story dormered fieldstone mansion set high on a steep lawn , stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn beside the broad Perkiomen . The property was meant to be an investment . Jean Audubon had begun his maritime career at twelve as a cabin boy on his father 's merchant ship out of Les Sables-d'Olonne downriver from Nantes on the west coast of France below the Loire . He had advanced to apprentice sailor and eventually captained ships of his own , fishing on the Grand Banks and hauling cargo . Many profitable voyages later , he had acquired a sugar plantation and refinery on Saint Domingue , France 's most prosperous colony , where sugar and indigo worked by half a million African slaves supplied two-thirds of pre-Revolutionary France 's overseas trade . But slave uprisings in Guadeloupe and Martinique and the first stirrings of revolution in France and on Saint Domingue itself had alerted the shrewd n ? gociant to potential disaster . The funds he used to buy Mill Grove came from the hasty sale of a portion of his Les Cayes plantation . Two years later , back in Nantes and an officer in the Republican Guard , he arranged to have his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the daughter of a second , quadroon mistress , delivered to him from Saint Domingue . The ship entered the Loire in June 1791 with Rose listed on the manifest as Jeanne Rabin 's daughter , obscuring her mixed race ; the revolution that eventually established the Republic of Haiti engulfed the island in August . // At Miers Fisher 's country house northwest of Philadelphia young Audubon improved his English further , but by Quaker standards his recreations were shocking . Fisher " was opposed to music of all descriptions , " he complains , " as well as to dancing , could not bear me to carry a gun , or fishing-rod , and , indeed , condemned most of my amusements . " Fisher had impressionable daughters and adolescent sons . As soon as he could decently do so , he delivered his client 's wayward heir on to Mill Grove to board with its less observant Quaker tenant William Thomas and Thomas 's wife and several sons . John James counted Fisher 's departure " a true deliverance " but at least in recollection honored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so different , for he certainly was a good and learned man . " Fisher arranged for Thomas to pay John James a quarterly allowance subtracted from his $400 annual lease , and the young man settled in. // Mill Grove delighted him . " Hunting , fishing , drawing , and music occupied my every moment ; cares I knew not , and cared naught about them . " But since his father had by then lost most of his wealth in the revolutions of France and Saint Domingue , what would be the young man 's occupation ? Jean Audubon had expectations of Mill Grove . The property was known for its mineral deposits , particularly lead . Lead , with its low melting point and high density , was a valuable commodity at a time when hunting with muzzle-loading flintlocks was nearly universal , Quaker lawyers excepted . Hunters ramrodded their weapons with powder , paper and ball each time they fired and routinely carried lead and bullet molds to make their own balls . // In April 1802 Miers Fisher had alerted his Nantes client to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first five years ' lease , or probably before , William Thomas discovered what he thought a very rich lead mine on the premises &amp; communicated the discovery to me , at the same time producing a sample of the ore . Upon inquiry I found that he thought it to exist there in very great quantities &amp; seemed desirous to purchase the land ; I told him I had no authority to sell it . . . but promised to inform thee thereof . . . . In this expectation I have kept him on the place ever since &amp; he has paid his rent with more punctuality than is usual with tenants here . . . . He is the only person who knows where the mine is to be found , &amp; will not disclose it until he has some benefit allotted to him for his discovery . . . . He has a very high opinion of it-I have had a sample of it assayed &amp; am assured it will yield about 60 or 70 percent of lead from the 100 lb. of ore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidential friend to judge for thee in this important affair-it may be sufficient to restore all thy losses . // Letters traveled slowly and uncertainly in the age of sail , and another year passed before Jean Audubon could send someone to represent him , a young Frenchman supposed to be knowledgeable about ores and mining . Francis Dacosta had arrived in Philadelphia in the spring of 1803 , a few months before John James , carrying Jean Audubon 's power of attorney . He was authorized to sell Thomas the Mill Grove acreage that lay across the Perkiomen from the main house in exchange for the location of the lead vein , but Miers Fisher thought such a move unwise-what if the Perkiomen bottomland covered even more valuable veins of ore ? - so Dacosta pried the location of the vein from Thomas by paying $300 of his $400 annual lease that May and promis-ing more . Corresponding with Dacosta about these first negotiations , Jean Audubon revealed his parental program : " Remember , my dear sir , I expect that if your plan succeeds , my son will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for himself , in order to spare me from expenses that I can only with difficulty support . " Dacosta had taken rooms in Philadelphia that fall to wait out the winter before opening up the mine , which meant John James could continue carefree at Mill Grove at least until spring . // To cut a proper figure a young man needed a horse . Thomas had none to spare . An English family had bought the larger plantation up the hill to the south and across the road and was just moving in ; John James might inquire there . On November 11 he did and met William Bakewell , the patriarch , a sturdy , educated squire from Derbyshire by way of New Haven , Connecticut , where he and his brother Benjamin had owned and operated an ale brewery until it burned down the previous winter . The Bakewells had arrived only two days before ; William turned John James over to his guest , General Andrew Porter of nearby Norristown , and went about his business . // William Bakewell was a blunt and skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental chemist , discoverer of oxygen and ammonia and religious reformer who had emigrated to America in 1794 and founded a colony near Northumberland , Pennsylvania , where William had also bought land . ( " A feather-bed to catch a falling Christian , " the Bakewell family physician , Erasmus Darwin , had jokingly called Unitarianism , but dissent was dangerous business-mobs burned down Priestley 's house and other dissenting leaders found themselves transported among common criminals to Botany Bay . ) William had seriously considered buying a farm in the Shenandoah Valley before Porter pointed him to the Greek Revival mansion with its lush estate and wide view of Valley Forge southward across the Schuylkill . He chose it for its fertility and accepted its odd name , Fatland Ford . " It is not improbable , " he wrote a Derbyshire cousin , " that the name of the ford on the Schuylkill below the mansion was taken ( tho ' rather vulgarly expressed ) from the quality of the land as it is very fertile indeed . " // John James pursued his horse buying . William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his card and an invitation to go hunting . Audubon may have been away-he claimed he was out looking for birds-but he had a chip on his shoulder about the English , who had twice jailed his father as a prisoner of war in his maritime years . His father had dismissed the boy 's prejudice magisterially , telling him " thy blood will cool in time . . . . Thou has not been in England ; I have , and it is a fine country . " The young man 's blood cooled early in the new year 1804 when he encountered William Bakewell // and his pointers pursuing grouse in the snow-silenced woods along the Perkiomen . " I was struck with the kind politeness of his manner , and found him an expert marksman . Entering into conversation , I admired the beauty of his well-trained dogs , and , apologizing for my discourtesy , finally promised // to call upon him and his family . " Mrs. Thomas had been encouraging him as well , coaching her boarder that the Bakewells had attractive and interesting daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion house just after the middle of January 1804 : // It happened that William Bakewell was absent from home , and I was shown into a parlor where only one young lady was snugly seated at her work by the fire . She rose on my entrance , offered me a seat , and assured me of the gratification her father would feel on his return , which , she added , would be in a few moments , as she would dispatch a servant for him . //
