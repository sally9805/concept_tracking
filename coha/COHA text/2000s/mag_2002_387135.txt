Mom-tested answers to your toughest questions Photograph The car seat need n't be a lamentation station // My 2-month-old hates to be in a car seat and wails every time we go for a drive . Any suggestions to make driving easier for her-and me ? A. Knowing that your baby 's behavior is common wo n't make the ride any easier , but it may help put things in perspective . Infants who fall asleep minutes after you pull out of the driveway may be in the majority , but there 's a sizable ( and vocal ) minority who apparently did n't read the " What to Do on Car Drives " chapter in the baby manual . Your little bundle of lungpower probably is n't in pain ( although you should check out that possibility with her doctor-she could have motion sickness , which can be worse in certain positions , but that 's rare ) . She may simply need to adjust to the sensation of being a mere speck of cargo in a vast moving machine , in which case all you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . See if these strategies help : Make sure the buckle is n't pinching her and the straps are n't either too tight or too loose . Try wrapping her up in a blanket ( looser around the legs ) before you put her in the seat and using a rolledup receiving blanket alongside her , to stop her head from flopping over . Rig up a shatterproof mirror so she can stare at herself ( and you can see her in your rearview mirror ) and string up a few soft toys where she can see them . Leave a back window open in good weather-the breeze and white noise may help knock her out . Chatter about where you 're going and what you 're doing so she knows you 're still there-and to remind yourself that crying does n't change the fact that you 're late getting to Aunt Margaret 's or that you 're out of everything and you absolutely must get to the store . Do n't take her crying personally , and hold on to your sense of humor . Go out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will feel like a day at the spa . Q. Why does my 4-year-old son ignore me for half an hour after I get home from work , and for even longer after I return from a business trip ? A. There are at least two possibilities . He could be operating on autopilot , going about his business just as he did while you were n't around . Or it 's payback time-he 's giving you the cold shoulder for having had the audacity to leave him . In either case , the fact that your persona non grata status ends proves that your child still loves you ( obviously ) and that you 're back on his radar screen . Kids who act this way about their parents ' homecomings often have trouble making transitions in general . Routines and rituals help . So try to get home around the same time each evening . Preschoolers ca n't tell time , but they know when you usually get home ( after Dragon Tales , before dinner ) . Of course , on work trips you ca n't guarantee exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an ETA . While you 're away , talk to your son on the phone ( if he 'll get on ) or e-mail him . Bring him a little present from your travels-not to buy his affection but because it shows you were thinking about him and because it 's just fun to get stuff from such exotic places as New Jersey . When my girls were smaller , we had a couple of home-from-work rituals that instantly switched us to family time . With Madeline , it was " roly-poly girl , " in which we 'd roll around on the bed , locked in each other 's arms and laughing . Ellie would put her hand out and ask for my earrings , as if to defrock me of my work attire , and then sit on my lap in the rocker and examine them . The parent-child relationship is one in which problems and concerns can , over time , mellow into nice memories . I hope yours will too . Q. My sister and her husband avoid saying the word " no " to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are they right ? A. The judicious use of " no " is n't likely to hurt any more than the prudent use of " yes . " If your sister and her husband are afraid that a few well-deserved " no 's " will crush their children , then they do n't have much faith in the resilience of the human spirit and they have n't seen Rebel Without a Cause lately . Remember James Dean 's dad ? All the kid wanted was his father to say " no " every once in a while . The question may be a matter of semantics as much as anything else . There are many synonyms for the word " no , " and we 're free to use the ones we like best . But " no " should still be the message , and it 's an important one for a child to hear , such as when he 's about to touch a hot stove-or worse . Once , when I was in a clothing-store dressing room , I heard a mother in the stall next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you really want to put all those pins in your mouth ? " Of course he did . He was 2-what did he know about the many hazards of eating tiny , slender steel spears ? Clearly , " no " has its place . But stopping to ponder whether " yes " is possible is also a good idea . " We 're all so busy that " no " can too easily become our default answer , " says Rabbi Susan Silverman , coauthor of Jewish Family &; Life : Traditions , Holidays , and Values for Today 's Parents and Children . To correct this , Silverman , the mother of three , has started taking three seconds to think over a request before saying no to her kids . " Do I really have to say no to a request for toasting marshmallows or for playing in the yard until it 's time to get in the car ? The big ethical no 's we ca n't waver on . These little fun things we can . " Sidebar Do You Need a Reality Check ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family matters ?
