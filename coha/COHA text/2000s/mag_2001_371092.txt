This tour has been a bit of a love fest , " says U2 frontman Bono , sounding genuinely humbled and slightly surprised that a tour by one of the most celebrated bands in the world in support of one of its most acclaimed albums in years would generate any sort of affection at all . " I 've nearly wept reading some of the reviews of the shows , they 've been so effusive . " He pauses and smiles . " It 's just great being in this band at this minute . " <P> There have certainly been other great moments to be in U2 over the course of the past two decades . The band 's previous outing , the Popmart tour  --  when the boys from Dublin appeared in a huge onstage lemon and got pelted by ( metaphorical ) rotten fruit by critics in the U.S.  --  probably was n't one of them . But their latest CD , All That You Ca n't Leave Behind , which was released last October , went to No. 1 in 32 countries , won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold-out tour . Building on the fresh momentum , U2 is gearing up for a new series of U.S. shows this fall . Forget the lemons . This time the band is making lemonade . <P> With the new album and tour , U2 has left behind the techno trappings of 1997 's Pop for straight-on , earthy , lusty rock ' n ' roll .

During the North American leg of the Elevation tour , the band showed footage of Charlton Heston defending his views on firearms followed by stark footage of a small child playing with a gun and violent scenes from Vietnam as a sarcastic introduction to the song Bullet the Blue Sky . The new album , All That You Ca n't Leave Behind , takes its title from a song dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Burmese resistance leader Aung San Suu Kyi , and the liner notes urge fans to remember victims of Sierra Leone rape and war crimes and to support Amnesty International , Greenpeace and the children 's charity War Child . These are n't topics you 'll hear addressed at , say , a Limp Bizkit show .
