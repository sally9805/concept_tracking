It seemed like an extremely clever idea at the time : a stylish two-seater commuter car that would be ideal for city traffic , small enough to fit in the tiniest of parking spots and highly fuel efficient . It seems like an even better idea now . But 11 years after Mercedes dreamed up the idea with Nicholas Hayek , the creator of Swatch watches , the minute Smart car has become an oversize drain on the automaker 's profits . In the first six months of this year , Mercedes plunged into the red because of a massive $1.3 billion restructuring charge it took for its Smart operations . <P> Smart 's woes are typical of the troubles afflicting the entire Mercedes group . The car 's manufacturing costs are far too high , especially given its relatively small scale  --  last year the company sold just 150,000 of them . Smart 's managers were overly ambitious in developing new models too quickly , according to company officials and analysts . Hayek long ago dropped out . But even before the original model he helped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory : the model range was extended to a four-seater , a roadster and a planned SUV . <P> Mercedes and its parent , DaimlerChrysler , have delivered an ultimatum to Smart , which is based near Stuttgart but whose cars are manufactured in France : Break even by 2007 or else . The roadster and the SUV have been axed , as have one-third the employees . Ulrich Walker , Smart 's president , says the firm has reduced fixed costs 26% and is " on the right track toward an economically sound future . " Some financial analysts are urging Daimler not to wait until 2007 , but Dieter Zetsche , the newly appointed chief executive , says that " it 's only fair to give them the time to deliver on their promises . " <P> With its hugely successful Mini , Mercedes ' archrival BMW has shown that there is a market for small commuter cars  --  even in the SUV-happy U.S. If Smart does buck the odds and survive , the next big decision will be whether to launch the car in the States . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will comply with U.S. road requirements , company officials say . In hindsight , " we were naive , " says a senior Smart executive . " We initially said we were n't selling a car but an idea . Now we know that customers want to buy cars , not ideas . "
