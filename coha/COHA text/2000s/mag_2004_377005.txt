The smoothness of Leonardo DiCaprio 's face is deceptive . He can hide behind its boyish affability the way Laurence Olivier hid behind putty noses and funny accents . In Catch Me If You Can , DiCaprio 's face was a blank check on which his character forged a career in duplicity . At other times , as in Gangs of New York , a rage can pop out like a monster in a lake . His face is too soft to be a tabula rasa ; it is a pillow on which DiCaprio can embroider surprising emotions . That 's why he is an actor , a gifted one , even more than he is a movie star . <P> All this suits him to play Howard Hughes , who was an enigma even more than he was a tycoon . A pampered rich kid , Hughes made millions in the aviation and hotel industries . As Hollywood 's longest resident outsider , he directed the terrific aerial epic Hell 's Angels and produced two films that defined their genres for decades : the newspaper comedy The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't flying planes , and crashing them , he was wooing glamour gals Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner . Best of all , Hughes was a full-time eccentric who finally achieved a madness as bizarre as it was picturesque . <P> This is the stuff of pulp fiction ; that 's how the ' 60s novel and film The Carpetbaggers played it . Martin Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan take a statelier approach , retelling two decades of Hughes ' life in chronological order and trying to explain of pestilence . This penny-Freud thesis ca n't support the film 's nearly three ambling hours . We 're happy to take the trip with Hughes but do n't know how he reached Destination Crazy Hermit . <P> While youngsters may wonder who Jean Harlow was ( and whether she was as wan and angular as Gwen Stefani plays her ) , the Turner Classic Movies crowd will enjoy Cate Blanchett 's high-pitched impersonation of Hepburn . If you 're going to do Kate , do her up grand , lovey . Kate Beckinsale does n't have the Gardner glow , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into loopiness . <P> Scorsese movies always have a bounty of great scenes , little miracles of kinesis , and this one is no exception . Any time the film takes place in a plane , it soars ( one thrilling takeoff , two amazing crashes ) . The Aviator has an opulence reminiscent of classic MGM . There 's also an efficient crackle to the postwar duel Hughes wages with a crafty Senator ( Alan Alda ) . But this handsome movie is an oddly well-behaved one to come from the preternaturally energetic Scorsese . <P> DiCaprio is ever plausible and watchable ; he carries this big picture with grace . As for Scorsese , he seems to have taken a cue from the DiCaprio faade , fashioning a portrait of smooth surfaces and trusting DiCaprio to show what 's inside . Well , an actor can reveal meaning , but he should n't be asked to invent it . Despite its star 's heroic efforts , The Aviator is a gorgeous jet , flying on automatic pilot .  --  By Richard Corliss        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
