Section : IRAQ <p> WHO IS THE ENEMY ? U.S. soldiers still do n't really know who they are fighting . Culture clashes , communication gaps and poor preparations have hurt intelligence on the ground . And any way you cut it , the difficulties do n't spell s-u-c-c-e-s-s . <p> It 's hard to know your enemy when you do n't speak his language . In Iraq , when guerrillas place an IED ( improvised explosive device ) by the side of the road , they sometimes write a warning on the street  --  in Arabic . The locals understand to steer clear ; the Americans drive right into the trap . " Everyone knows about it except us , " grouses Lt. Julio Tirado of the 124th Infantry Regiment , Florida National Guard , patrolling warily in the town of Ramadi . <p> The Americans are learning the universal language of insult . They catch on now when Iraqis in the seething Sunni Triangle flash them a backhanded V sign , which conveys roughly the same message as an extended middle finger back in the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locals , they point to the soles of their feet , deeply offensive to Iraqis . <p> What the Americans still do n't know is who , exactly , they 're fighting . Last week , after four suicide-bombing attacks in the heart of Baghdad left more then 30 people dead , Brig . Gen. Mark Hertling , deputy commander of the First Armored Division , told reporters that the attacks were the work of " foreign fighters . " Yet just 24 hours earlier his division commander , Brig . Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , told a news conference that he had not seen " any infusion of foreign fighters in Baghdad . " <p> Foreigners or locals ? Which is it ? U.S. intelligence officials split the difference and suggested that Baathist dead-enders had hired foreign jihadists ( or , possibly , local fanatics ) to drive the suicide vehicles . But they could n't really know for sure . The level of confusion and guesswork was telling and unsettling . How can Americans know whether to support the occupation of Iraq if their own leaders do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out ? <p> President George W. Bush continues to proclaim that the escalating terrorism in Iraq , some 25 to 30 attacks per day , up from 15 to 20 in September , is actually a good sign . " The more successful we are on the ground , the more these killers will react , " the president told reporters . But that smacks more of campaign rhetoric ( or wishful thinking ) than strategic reality . With the economy taking off ( a whopping 7 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter of 2003 ) , Iraq may become the central issue of Bush 's re-election bid . Right now success or failure turns on some basic questions that the U.S. government is woefully unprepared to answer . <p> The intelligence community  --  the CIA , the DIA , the various branches of military intelligence  --  can not decide whether it is fighting a ragtag resistance or a well-organized insurgency . The majority view , particularly at the CIA , holds that the terror campaign is the work of small , probably isolated , largely uncoordinated cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalists . Other intelligence officials suggest that Saddam himself is still running the show and that the persistent and escalating pattern of bombings suggests some kind of broader , coherent strategy to drive out the American " occupiers . " Last week administration officials tried to downplay reports of Saddam 's resurgence , suggesting that he was still too busy hiding to take much of an active role . CIA analysts were more confident that one of his top deputies , Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri , was supervising a surviving network of Fedayeen guerrilla fighters . Yet other reports suggested that al-Duri invalid , dying of cancer . <p> Saddam 's secret police were apparently prepared to run a terror campaign against the American invader from the beginning . U.S. forces in Iraq have discovered stockpiles of as many as 500 " suicide vests , " bomb-laden garments similar to those used by Palestinian terrorists against Israeli targets . Explosives are not hard to come by ; hundreds of Iraqi arms caches have been left unguarded . A month ago an Iraqi citizen approached some U.S. soldiers , offering to sell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to shoot down commercial airliners . When the soldiers offered the man $250 , he drove back with a truckload of missiles and collected a payment of $40,000 . He told the GIs that he would have brought more but he could n't fit them all into his truck . <p> What are the ties , if any , between Saddam 's holdouts and the terrorist jihadis who slip across Iraq 's porous borders ? The intelligence community is left mostly guessing . The CIA had been unable to penetrate Saddam 's police state with its own spies before the war . U.S. intelligence operatives have been stretched thin , many of them devoted to the so-far fruitless search for weapons of mass destruction . An internal Army evaluation , published last month by the Center for Army Lessons Learned in Fort Leavenworth , Kans. , bluntly criticized Army intelligence for poor preparation and highlighted various technological and bureaucratic foul-ups . A communications network that was supposed to link intelligence teams and tap databases worked so poorly that it was " nonexistent . " The " lack of competent interpreters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errands such as going off " to buy chicken and soft drinks , " the report stated . <p> America 's intelligence analysts are hobbled by a deeper misunderstanding . Why would n't Iraqis want to trade in tyranny for freedom , they ask  --  and turn in the remnants of the old regime ? It is true , as Bush administration spokesmen often point out , that Iraqis hardly yearn for Saddam 's return . Indeed , a majority want Americans to stay in the country long enough to provide some degree of stability and security . But American promises of democracy are very threatening to a significant minority . Ever since the days of British colonial rule after World War I , the Sunni Arabs , who make up perhaps only a quarter of the populace but dominate the metropolitan elite and urban middle class , have held power over the more populous but poorer Shiites and Kurds . In an American-created democracy , power would shift to the Shiites . It has hardly gone unnoticed in the Sunni community that 55 percent of the members of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to drive out the Americans and restore not the wicked Saddam and his cronies , but a Sunni-dominated state . Like the Irish Roman Catholic sympathizers who " left their back doors open " to allow IRA fugitives to evade British troops during the Northern Ireland Troubles , the citizens of the Sunni Triangle around Baghdad are apt to at least passively support an insurgency . In some Sunni strongholds like Tikrit , Saddam 's old hometown , the populace is openly defiant . <p> There is no guarantee that the violence will not spread to the Kurdish north or the Shiite south . The Kurds feel very threatened by the 10,000 peacekeepers promised to the United States by Turkey , the Kurds ' ancient oppressors . The older Shiite ayatollahs have counseled patience , but some young extremist clerics are itching to impose an Islamic theocracy on Iraq . The anti-American resistance may have recruited , or hired , suicide bombers from the 1.5 million Shiites living in the slums of Sadr ( formerly Saddam ) City , the ghetto in the heart of Baghdad . <p> Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush administration might be wise to find a way to accommodate the religious and tribal politics of Iraq . At least in the short term , an old-fashioned Chicago-style machine , dispensing patronage in return for favors , is a more viable model than one man , one vote . Indeed , some of the savvier American ground commanders already recognize this reality . Lt. Col. Hector Mirabile of the First Battalion , 124th Infantry Regiment , the Florida National Guard unit patrolling Ramadi , is a major in the Miami police force in civilian life . He appears to instinctively understand colonial policing as the British practiced it a century ago . " This is an ultratribal area , " Mirabile explained to NEWSWEEK . " We understand that there 's no winning this battle without winning the hearts and minds of the people , and you do n't do that without winning the sheiks . " <p> Mirabile described just what that entails : first handshakes , then tea , then 10 minutes of pleasantries . " And from there you talk business . Contracts are our No. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rebuild schools or provide other community services ( with a tidy profit , up to 20 percent , built in for the sheik ) . But if violence breaks out  --  like the mortar attack that occurred just the day before  --  " I 'll be calling on the sheik and asking , ' Why did that happen ? ' " says Mirabile . " If they ca n't deliver , we 'll reduce their contracts . If he does n't help , we 'll go to him and say , ' Your area is not really safe yet  --  people ca n't work here . ' And he 'll say , ' S  --  t , this is affecting the bottom line ' . " <p> A practical way to keep the peace . But for Mirabile 's troopers , the culture gap still yawns in ways that feel not only alien but threatening . In their wrap-around shades and body armor , the soldiers look like creatures from outer space to the Iraqis ( who generally do not wear sunglasses and suspect that the Americans ' Ray-Bans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the mortar attack , " the police chief came over to talk , " says Sgt. William Sanchez , 33 . " He was gon na give me that Arab kiss thing . I said , ' I do n't kiss , buddy . How ya doin ' ? ' " <p> Specialist Jose ( Psycho ) Lopez , 21 , struggles to know how to handle more threatening situations . " You see them standing there and they 're doing this ... " He makes a slashing motion across his throat . " You see them , but what are you going to do ? Kill them ? I 'll grab them by the throat and slap them hard . " Maybe not the best way to make friends and cultivate informants . <p> Iraq 's New resistance : As attacks increase in Iraq , U.S. intelligence scrambles to learn who is behind them . Saddam loyalists , foreign fighters and jihadist groups seem to be everywhere  --  and nowhere . Here is a rundown of what is known about the resistance . <p> 1 . THE OLD REGIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunni Triangle <p> The Threat : Networks operating underground include Baath Party officials . Iraqi intelligence officers and the Saddam Fedayeen militia . May be taking orders from Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri , vice president of the Revolutionary Command Council . <p> <p> 2 . ANSAR AL-ISLAM <p> Ethnicity : Mostly Kurdish <p> Home Base : Northern Iraq , near Iranian border <p> The Threat : Its training camps in Iraq were destroyed by the U.S. , and most members escaped to Iran . Many have since returned  --  some are suspects in the bombings of the Jordanian Embassy and U.N . headquarters . <p> <p> 3 . OTHER SUNNIS <p> Ethnicity : Sunni Arab <p> Home Base : Sunni Triangle <p> The Threat : Groups like Muhammad 's Second Army have claimed responsibility for attacks on Americans , but little is known about these groups . They seem to have tribal interests , but may be working with regime elements . <p> <p> 4 .

FOREIGN FIGHTERS <p> Ethnicity : Various <p> Home Bases : Syria , Saudi Arabia , other <p> The Threat : A recent series of high-profile attacks  --  including a suicide bombing at the Red Cross  --  suggests the work of foreign Islamic radicals , perhaps connected to Al Qaeda .
