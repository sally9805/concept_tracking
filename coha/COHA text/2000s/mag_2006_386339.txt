. POPULAR SCIENCE has just built a house in California equipped with the most advanced materials , gadgets and appliances available today . On these pages , we take a giant leap forward  --  showing how that same house would look and function if it were created a decade or so in the future . JUST EAST of San Francisco , on a hill facing picturesque Mt . Diablo , sits a $5.5-million luxury home that POPULAR SCIENCE helped create . Working with architecture firm the Dahlin Group and Sunset magazine , which builds " Idea Homes " annually to showcase residential trends , we filled the Innovation House depicted here with our favorite technologies  --  cutting-edge hardware and gadgetry that are available now but that also illuminate the trajectories of future home tech . The following pages present a detailed vision of that future , from robotic household help to an entirely new paradigm for home construction . You can visit the Innovation House through November 12 . For directions and more coverage , visit popsci.com/hof . Finally , to see what your future home might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMFORTS " Smart " home surfaces will let you customize your environment with just a touch 1 NEW WINDOW EVERY DAY Do n't like the view ? Change it . Future walls will allow for easy relocation of windows THE SAME technology that will one day create paper-thin televisions and computer displays  --  organic light-emitting diodes , or OLEDs  --  will lead to walls with user-definable window spaces . Large sections of external walls will hold transparent OLEDs , with opaque and clear areas adjusted by simply " dragging " open windows and repositioning them to your liking on the wall . The rest of the wall can be any color or design that you want . It will function much like computer desktops do , and the opaque spaces will even be able to display information , images or artwork . ETA : 2025 2 SELF-CLEANING EVERYTHING Home surfaces stay permanently clean , thanks to materials that kill microbes and eradicate dirt TODAY 'S " SELF-CLEANING " glass uses ultraviolet rays from the sun to energize a coating of titanium dioxide nanoparticles that breaks down dirt , which is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same technology be used to create a self-cleaning bathroom or microbe-clobbering kitchen counter in rooms that get little or no sunlight ? Researchers are working on modifying the nanoparticles so they can absorb light at longer wavelengths ( that is , ordinary room lighting ) to create walls , tabletops and other indoor surfaces that actively kill microbes and clean with a quick swipe of a damp cloth . ETA : 2010 3 REPAINT WALLS ON A WHIM Electricity , sound or light will signal color particles in paint to change their hue FORGET ABOUT SPENDING hours agonizing over paint chips to pick the perfect room color . Future walls will change their hue according to how you 're feeling ( paint that changes color in response to temperature is already available ) . With microscopic particles of three primary colors embedded in the paint surface , each triggered by either mild electrical current , a flash of colored light or a sound frequency , you 'll be able to brighten your mood with yellow walls or tint the room to complement the outfit you 're wearing for a dinner party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated into fabrics , you could just as easily tint the dress to match the walls . ) ETA : 2020 WHAT 'S IN THE POPSCI HOUSE Here are some of the gadgets we put into the living room of POPSCI 's Innovation House in Alamo , California TYPE-FREE It 's tedious to drag cumbersome folding laptops to the living-room sofa to surf the Internet .

Your refrigerator and kitchen cabinets will know what 's inside of them by reading your food 's embedded radio-frequency identification ( RFID ) tags  --  tiny integrated circuits that transmit unique ID codes when scanned . ( Internal sensors will identify spoiled food , eliminating the dreaded sniff test . ) A fridge-mounted screen will offer recommended dishes based on available ingredients , then show videos demonstrating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures automatically , or upload orders for missing items to your favorite store for delivery . Most of these technologies exist in demonstration systems today ; manufacturers are now waiting for RFID tags to become ubiquitous and for mainstream consumers to develop enough of an appetite for high-tech kitchen assistance to buy premium-priced " smart " appliances . ETA : 2015 2 ROBOT CHORES Cleaning up after your kids and fetching your beers  --  that 's all you ask HOUSEHOLD ROBOTS , drawing on research undertaken in defense and space applications , will begin to assist with physical chores and home security . ( It 's no coincidence that iRobot , creator of the Roomba robo-vacuum , also supplies Pack-Bot models for surveillance and bomb-disposal to military and police . ) Our homes will " speak " to these robotic companions using RFID tags that specify handling procedures and storage places for specific objects . Electronic beacons will mark passageways to supplement the robots ' sensors . As robotic balancing and walking capabilities evolve , expect two and four-legged robots to predominate  --  our homes were built to accommodate human- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same gyroscopic system as Segway scooters is due in 2008 from WowWee Ltd . ) . Another robotic technology to come : home manufacturing , using 3-D printing , of everything from custom utensils and dinnerware to toys and sculptures . ETA : 2016 3 NEVER LOSE YOUR KEYS AGAIN Find anything and everything in your house by calling out its name RFID TAGS  --  cheap labels that are quickly becoming widespread  --  are becoming so small and inexpensive , they 'll soon be found in everything you buy . Stores will use them to streamline the checkout process : An entire shopping cart will be scanned and totaled in one pass , and the credit card in your pocket will transfer its encrypted data . Combine these tags with whole-home sensor systems , and you 'll never search for your keys again  --  just ask the house where you left them . And if you 're running low on the essentials , whether pasta or toilet paper , the appropriate closet will alert you to the coming crisis .

As the reliability of biometric identification grows , such systems will become virtually foolproof . Giving your neighbor a spare key to come in and take care of the cat while you 're away soon wo n't be necessary  --  just enter your friend 's biometric data from a card he provides , and your scanners will recognize him when he visits . ETA : 2015 4 HOW TO KEEP YOU ON TRACK Your home will know where you are  --  and act accordingly IF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander through the home of the future , you 're probably right  --  the house will track its occupants through sensors in each room . Initially the information will be used to set lighting and temperature ( dim an unused room , kick up the AC if you 're starting to perspire ) , but this will evolve into a digital reminder system that follows you around . When your schedule  --  automatically extracted from your handheld device or entered in the wall-mounted tablet  --  says it 's time to fetch the kids from soccer practice , the room lights flash and a message appears on the wall . If you forget to take your medication , the house reminds you and notifies relatives if you fall far behind .
