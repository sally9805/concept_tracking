You 're a beautiful woman , sweetheart , " Edwin Friend began . His girlfriend , Bobbie Kaplowitz , paid attention : Edwin rarely spoke up and complimented her . He tipped his chair against her sink and glanced behind him , but the drainboard was n't piled so high that the back of his head would start an avalanche today . He took a decisive drink from his glass of water and continued , " But in that particular dress you look fat . " <p> It was a bright Saturday morning in October 1954 . Edwin often visited Bobbie on Saturday mornings , and she had dressed up a little , anticipating . Now she did n't bother to speak . She reached behind to unfasten the hook and eye at the back of her neck , worked the zipper down without help , stepped out of the dress , and in her underwear took the sharp scissors . She cut a big piece of brown wrapping paper from a roll she kept next to the refrigerator , while Edwin said several times , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was chestnut brown with a rust- and cream-colored arrow-like decoration that crossed her breasts and pointed fetchingly down . She set the folded dress in the middle of the paper , wrapped and taped it , and addressed the package to her slimmer sister in Pittsburgh . Then she went into the bedroom and changed into something seriously gorgeous . <p> " Come , Bradley , " she called , though Edwin would have babysat , but Bradley came quickly . He was a thin six-year-old with dark curls and the habit of resting his hands on his hips , so from the front he looked slightly supervisory and from the back his pointed elbows stuck out like outlines of small wings . They left Edwin looking surprised . At the post office , a considerable walk away , the clerk said the package had to be tied with string , but lent Bobbie a big roll of twine and his scissors . Bobbie was wearing high-heeled shoes , and she braced herself on the counter with one gloved hand . She was short , and the shoes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mouth , grasped it between her teeth , and jerked her head back to pull it tight . It was brown twine , now reddened with her lipstick , and its taste was woody and dry . Fibers separating from the twine might travel across Bobbie 's tongue and make her gag . For all she knew , her poor old teeth might loosen . <p> Much was brown : the twine , the paper around the package ( even the dress inside , if one could see it ) , and the wooden counter with its darkened brass decorations . The counter was old enough to have taken on the permanent sour coloring possessed by wooden and metal objects in Brooklyn that had remained in one place  --  where any hand might close upon them  --  since the century turned . But Bobbie 's lipstick , and the shoes she 'd changed into , and her suit  --  which had a straight skirt with a kick pleat  --  were red . She wore a half-slip because she was a loose woman . Joke . Edwin 's hands always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to enjoy urging the nylon petticoat down , sliding the rubber knobs up and out of the metal loops that attached her stockings to her girdle , even tugging the girdle off . She never let him take off her nylons because he was n't careful . <p> Bobbie tied a firm knot . Then she changed her mind . She poked the roll of twine and the scissors toward the clerk with an apologetic wave , called to Bradley  --  who was hopping from one dark medallion on the tile floor to the next , flapping his arms  --  and went home . As Bobbie walked , one eye on Bradley , the package dangled from her finger on its string like a new purchase . At home she found Edwin taking apart her Sunbeam Mixmaster with her only tool , a rusty screwdriver . <p> " Did n't you say it was n't working ? " Edwin asked . <p> " There 's nothing wrong with it . I did n't say anything . " <p> Edwin was married . He had told Bobbie he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , who was old , silly , and anti-Semitic . But his mother lived in her own apartment and was not silly or anti-Semitic , as far as he knew . Edwin had a wife named Dorothy , a dental hygienist . She 'd stopped working when their first child was born  --  they had two daughters  --  but sometimes she helped out her old boss . Now , fumbling to put Bobbie 's mixer back together , Edwin began to wonder uneasily whether it was n't Dorothy , dressing for work in her uniform , who happened to mention a broken mixer . He had never confused the two women before in the years he 'd been Bobbie 's boyfriend . <p> Edwin 's monkey business had begun by mistake . He was a salesman for a baking supply company , and Bobbie was in charge of the payroll at a large commercial bakery . Though Edwin did n't wear a ring , he believed that everyone in the firms through which he passed assumed he was somebody 's husband . However , a clerk in Bobbie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman , who had distinctive habits , asked him straight out , Edwin misheard the question and said no . He had heard , " Mr. Friend , are you merry ? " <p> Edwin was good-natured but not merry , and the question puzzled him until he found himself having lunch with Bobbie , to whom the young woman from Minneapolis had introduced him . He realized that he was on a date . Bobbie seemed eager and attractive , while Dorothy liked to make love about as often as she liked to order tickets and go to a Broadway show , or invite her whole family for dinner , and with about as much planning . Not knowing exactly what he had in mind , Edwin suggested that Bobbie meet him for a drink after work , nervous that she 'd refuse anything less than dinner and a movie . But she agreed . Drinking a quick whiskey sour in a darkened lounge , she suggested that next time he come to her house . So his visits began : daytime conversations over a glass of water or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobbie was always interested . She only needed to make sure Bradley was sleeping . <p> Bobbie rarely spoke of her marriage . Her husband had been a tense , mumbly man , a printer . He 'd remained aloof from her family . At first he said she was nothing like her crude relatives . " I felt refined , but I did n't like it , " Bobbie told Edwin . Later her husband began to say she was exactly like her family , and at last he moved her and Bradley , an infant , into a dark two-room apartment where nothing worked and there was hardly ever any hot water . He said he slept at his shop , and at first he brought her money , but soon that stopped . " I did n't have enough hot water to bathe the baby , " Bobbie said . " Let alone my whole self . " Edwin imagined it : naked Bobbie clasping a thin baby and splashing warm water on herself from a chipped , shallow basin . She 'd moved back with her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment on Elton Street where Edwin now visited her . When Bradley was two , she had taken him on the train to Reno , lived there for six weeks , and come home divorced , bringing her sisters silver pins and bracelets with Indian designs on them , arrows and stylized birds . <p> Bobbie 's family would n't care much that Edwin was n't Jewish , she assured him , and they 'd understand that he could n't be around often because of his mother . But they did want to know him . So Edwin had consented to an occasional Sunday lunch in Bobbie 's kitchen with her mother or one of her sisters , eating whitefish and kippered salmon and bagels off a tablecloth printed with cherries , and watching the sun move across the table as the afternoon lengthened and he imagined Dorothy wondering . After the bagels they 'd have coffee with marble cake from Bobbie 's bakery . He 'd tip his chair against the porcelain sink and consider how surprised his wife would be if she knew where he was , being polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger and more up-to-date . <p> Dorothy would be even more surprised if she knew , right now , that Edwin was in that same kitchen , less sunny in the morning , fixing a mixer that was n't broken . Edwin would have preferred to be a bigamist , not a deceiver . When he reassembled the mixer , it did n't work . He left the bowls and beaters and took the big contraption home in the trunk of his car . He 'd work on it when Dorothy was out . She had promised Dr. Dressel , her old boss , a few hours in the coming week . <p> The day Edwin carried off the mixer , Bobbie 's sister Sylvia and her kids , Joan and Richard , rang Bobbie 's bell after lunch because they were all going to the Hayden Planetarium . Sylvia , a schoolteacher , had said , " Bradley 's ready , " as if she 'd noticed blanks in his eyes where stars and planets belonged . Her own kids had often been to the planetarium . So the sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stamped on piles of brown sycamore leaves . Climbing the stairs to the elevated train , Bobbie was already tired . She 'd have changed her shoes , but she liked the look of the red heels . They waited on the windy platform , Joan holding Bradley 's hand tightly . She and Richard were tall , capable children who read signs out loud in firm voices : " No Spitting . " " Meet Miss Subways . " They had to change trains , and as the second one approached , Sylvia said , " Does Bradley know what to do in case we 're separated ? " <p> " Why should we get separated ? " said Bobbie . <p> " It can always happen , " she said as the doors opened . The children squeezed into one seat , and Sylvia leaned over them . She had short curly hair that was starting to go gray . " Remember , " she said , " in case we get separated , if you 're on the train , get off at the next stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wait where you are , and we 'll come back for you . Okay ? " <p> Joan and Richard were reaching across Bradley to slap each other 's knees , but Bradley nodded seriously . Bobbie rarely offered directives like that , and he probably needed them , yet she felt irritated . At the planetarium , Bradley tried to read aloud words on the curved ceiling that was covered with stars . The theater darkened . While the stars revolved swiftly , a slightly spooky voice spoke of a time so far back that Bobbie felt disjoined from herself : she in her red suit would surely never happen . Anything at all might be true . <p> Then Bradley whispered something . " Do you have to go to the bathroom ? " Bobbie asked . " I ca n't go in with you . " If Edwin would marry her , he 'd be there to take Bradley to the bathroom ! The size of Bobbie 's yearning , like the age of the stars , was suddenly clear . But Bradley shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do if you get off the train without me . " <p> " I would n't do that , honey , " she said , but of course he continued to worry . She could feel his little worry machines whirring beside her . <p> " You scared him , " she said to Sylvia later as they shuffled toward the exit with the crowd . " About being lost on the subway . " <p> " He needs to know , " Sylvia said , and Bobbie wondered if Sylvia would be as bossy if she did n't have a husband , Louis-an accountant , a good man ; although Sylvia said he was quick in bed . <p> They spent an hour in the natural history museum-where Joan held Bradley 's hand , telling him what Bobbie hoped were non-frightening facts  --  before taking the long subway ride home again . At the stop before theirs , Bradley suddenly stood and ran toward the closing doors , crying out . Richard tackled him , knocking him to the dirty floor , and Bobbie took him on her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , sweetie , " she said , brushing him off and kissing him . She carried him as far as the stairs . <p> " Well , I should n't have said anything , " said Sylvia as they reached the sidewalk and turned toward home . The train 's sound grew faint behind them . <p> Bobbie said nothing . If she agreed , Sylvia would change her mind and defend what she 'd said after all . Bobbie glanced back at the three kids , who were counting something out loud in exultant voices  --  passing cars , maybe . " Seven ! No , nine ! " <p> " I have chopped meat , " said Sylvia at last , when their silence had lasted for more than a block . " I 'll make mashed potatoes . Lou will drive you later , okay ? " <p> " That would be nice , " said Bobbie . They reached the corner of Sylvia 's street and turned that way . <p> " Unless you have a date ? " Sylvia added . <p> But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No such luck . " <p> " That guy has a problem , " said Sylvia . " It 's Saturday night ! " <p> " Edwin says I look fat in that brown dress , " Bobbie said . She never let herself think about Saturday nights . Edwin said his mother cooked corned beef and cabbage then , and minded if he went out . " Remember that dress ? With the design down the front ? " <p> " That gorgeous dress ! " Sylvia said . " To tell the truth , you do look a little hefty in it , but who cares ? " <p> In the dark , Bobbie cried . She hoped her sister would notice and maybe even put an arm around her , but that was n't their way . Maybe Sylvia did notice . " I 'll make a nice salad . You like salad , do n't you ? " she said soothingly . <p> Edwin 's house was empty when he came home on Tuesday . Dorothy was working , and the girls were at a neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed Dorothy 's mixer , the one that had been broken in the first place . It was not badly broken . A wire was loose . Then it occurred to him that the mixers looked alike , with bulbous arms to hold the beaters , and curved white bases on which bowls rotated . He 'd bought Dorothy 's after seeing Bobbie 's . Edwin set aside Dorothy 's bowls and beaters . He carried Dorothy 's fixed mixer out to his car , then returned and put Bobbie 's broken one on the sheet of newspaper . <p> He jumped when he heard Dorothy and the girls arriving , but there was nothing to worry about . Dorothy asked , " Did you fix it ? " and Edwin truthfully said , " Not yet . " She stood behind him watching as he took apart Bobbie 's mixer . By this time it was hard to remember that the broken mixer was the one he had broken himself , not the one Dorothy had reported broken , and he listened attentively while she told him what she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he listened , his back to his wife , he suddenly felt love and pity for her , as if only he knew that she had a sickness . He looked over at Dorothy in her thin white hygienist 's uniform , her green coat folded over her arm . She had short blond hair and glasses . <p> The girls had begun to play with a couple of small round dentist 's mirrors that Dorothy had brought from Dr. Dressel 's office . Mary Ann , the younger one , brought her mirror close to her eye . " I ca n't see anything , " she said . <p> " Wait a minute , " said Eileen . Her light hair was in half-unraveled braids . Eileen turned her back on Edwin and Dorothy , and positioned her mirror just above her head . " I 'm a spy , " she said . " Let 's see . . . oh , Daddy 's putting poison in the mixer . " Eileen would say anything . <p> " I 'm a spy , too , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving her mirror . " Show me . Show me how to be a spy . " <p> Edwin could n't fix Bobbie 's mixer , and it stayed broken , on a shelf in Edwin and Dorothy 's kitchen , for a long time . Meanwhile , Dorothy 's working mixer was in the trunk of Edwin 's car , and it was a natural thing to pretend it was Bobbie 's and take it to her house the next time he visited . <p> On many Thursdays Edwin told Dorothy a story about New Jersey , then arranged a light day and drove to Brooklyn to visit Bobbie . Bobbie prepared a good dinner that tasted Jewish to Edwin , though she said she was n't kosher . Little Bradley sat on a telephone book , and still his face was an inch off the plate , which he stared at , eating mostly mashed potatoes . " They 're better the way Aunt Sylvia makes them , with the mixer , " Bobbie said on this particular Thursday , the Thursday on which Edwin had brought her his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm sorry I could n't bring it sooner , babe . " <p> " Oh , I did n't mean that . I just do n't bother , the way Sylvia does . " <p> Edwin watched Bradley . With the mental agility born of his mixer exchange , Edwin imagined carrying Bradley off in similar fashion and replacing him , just temporarily , with talky Eileen . If her big sister was out of the way , Mary Ann would play with Bradley , while Bobbie would enjoy fussing with a girl . <p> " What are you thinking about ? " said Bobbie . <p> " I wish I could take Bradley home to meet my mother . " <p> " Take both of us . She wo n't be against Jewish girls once she sees me , " said Bobbie . " I do n't mean I 'm so special , but I do n't do anything strange . " <p> She hurried to clean up and put Bradley to bed , while Edwin , who had n't replied , watched television . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same show , with Groucho Marx . Over the noise of Groucho 's voice and the audience 's laughter , Edwin heard Bobbie 's voice now and then as she read aloud . " ' Faster , faster ! ' cried the bird , " Bobbie read . Soon she came in , and Edwin reached for her hand , but she shook her head . She always waited until Bradley was asleep , but that did n't take long . When she checked and returned smiling , Edwin turned off the set and put his hands on her shoulders , then moved them down her back and fumbled with her brassiere through her blouse . Dorothy wore full slips . Edwin pulled Bobbie 's ruffled pink blouse free and reached his hand under it . Even using only one hand , he 'd learned that if he worked from bottom to top , pushing with one finger and pulling with two others , he could undo all three hooks of her brassiere without seeing them . In a moment his hand was on her big round breast , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading him toward her bed . <p> Edwin forgot that Dorothy had promised Dr. Dressel she 'd work Saturday morning . As he dressed in Bobbie 's dark bedroom on Thursday night , she asked , " Will you come Saturday ? " <p> " Sure , babe , " he said . He had fallen asleep , but he could tell from Bobbie 's voice that she 'd remained awake , lying naked next to him . He leaned over to kiss her , then let himself out , rubbing his hand on his lips and checking for lipstick stains . <p> But on Saturday he had to stay with Eileen and Mary Ann , then pick up Dorothy at Dr. Dressel 's office . He was more at ease with the girls in the car than at home . Made restless by his broken promise to Bobbie , he left too early , then had to look after his children in the dentist 's waiting room . He did n't know how to braid Eileen 's hair , and it had not been done that morning ; Edwin noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to eat carrots and apples , that one of yesterday 's rubber bands still dangled off Eileen 's mussed hair . He called to her and tried to remove the band without pulling . " You 're hurting me , " she said , though he did n't think he was . <p> At last Dorothy came out in her coat . " I heard them whooping it up , " she said , but she sounded amused . She took two rubber bands from the receptionist 's desk and swiftly braided Eileen 's hair . Leaving the car where it was , they walked to a nearby luncheonette . Dorothy took Edwin 's hand . Sometimes she spoke to him in baby talk ; it was a kind of game . " I am going to teach you to bwaid hair , " she said . But he did n't know how to answer , so she spoke again , now taking his part , in a gruff voice like the Three Bears . " How on earth do you braid hair ? " He let go of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered with elaborate patience , " Well , first you make a center part . . . " Edwin imagined Bobbie watching them , not jealously . " Squeeze , " the imaginary Bobbie said , and Edwin squeezed his wife 's taut shoulder through the green coat . <p> Bobbie did n't use her mixer often . She was not sufficiently interested in its departure and return to put it away , so she left it on the extra chair next to the kitchen table where Edwin had put it . On Saturday morning she put on makeup and stockings , but he did n't come . Ordinarily , if Edwin did n't appear by a quarter to ten , Bobbie took Bradley out , rather than brooding . This Saturday , though , Bradley had a cold . To distract herself , Bobbie called Sylvia , who asked , " Does he have a temperature ? " Bobbie 's thermometer was broken , so Sylvia brought hers over . Bobbie made coffee . Bradley sat on the floor in his pajamas , wiping his nose on his sleeve while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . <p> Bobbie offered Sylvia a cookie , and she and Bradley said together , " Before lunch ? " but then everyone took a Mallomar , since Bobbie said a cookie might cheer her up . Bradley licked his fingers and then placed Florida in the puzzle correctly . <p> " Edwin did n't come today ? " Sylvia said , playing with her spoon . <p> " Sometimes he 's busy on Saturdays . " <p> " You need more . " <p> " I manage , " Bobbie said . If Sylvia knew all Edwin 's ways , she thought , she would n't object to him . " He 's worth it . " <p> Sylvia laughed , stretching her arm and actually taking a second cookie . " Oh , I know what you mean , " she said . She interrupted herself to supervise Bradley 's placement of California . " I know what you see in your Edwin . I see the way he looks at you . " <p> " When you 've been married a long time , " Bobbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Sylvia laughed . " I know how you feel , " she said again , not scolding . <p> " You mean you felt that way about Lou once . " <p> " Well , I suppose . " <p> " What did you mean ? " Bobbie said . <p> " Oh , I should n't say anything , " Sylvia said . She tipped the bowl of her spoon with one finger , making the handle rise . <p> " He 's not listening , " Bobbie said , tilting her head toward Bradley . " You mean-someone ? " <p> " Someone I met at an in-service course . " <p> " Another teacher ? A man . " <p> " He teaches at Midwood . " <p> " A high school teacher . You-have feelings ? " Bobbie said . <p> " Did this ever happen to you ? " Sylvia said , now glad-it seemed-to talk . " At night , you know , picturing the wrong person ? " <p> Bobbie thought she knew what Sylvia meant . She was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one occasion or several . " How many times have you seen him ? " <p> " Wait a minute , " said Sylvia , but then she crouched on the floor . " Does n't Colorado belong where you put Wyoming , Bradley ? " Wyoming was nice and tight . " Could the map be wrong ? " <p> " Did you have lunch with him ? " <p> " Oh , I 'm exaggerating , it 's nothing , " Sylvia said . She remained on the floor , helping Bradley with a few more states . Then she got up , reaching out a hand to steady herself on the extra chair . She gave the Mixmaster a pat . " Hey , you did n't just buy this , did you ? " <p> " No , I 've had it for a while . " <p> " I might have been able to get you a discount . A client of Lou 's . . . " <p> " I bought it last year . " <p> " Oh , right . " Sylvia seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair , so Bobbie told in full the story Sylvia had heard only in part : the story of the dress , the walk to the post office , and her return to find Edwin fixing a mixer that was n't broken . <p> " He took it home ? Why did he do that ? " Sylvia asked . <p> " At home he has tools . " <p> " Maybe he took it to a repair place . " <p> " Oh , no . I 'm sure he fixed it himself , " said Bobbie . <p> " You 're sure he brought back the same mixer ? " <p> " You mean he bought me a new one ? I hope not ! " Bobbie said . <p> " Or he could have bought a used one , " said Sylvia . <p> " Oh , stop being so suspicious . " She liked the more tremulous Sylvia who had spoken of the teacher from Midwood High School . She was n't ready , yet , for the usual Sylvia . " Of course it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she insisted it was hers , Bobbie suddenly sensed that the mixer on the chair might never have been in her house before , and then , looking hard , she was certain . It was the same , but somehow not the same . It had been cleaned differently , maybe with a sponge , not a dishrag . But that thought was ridiculous . It had been handled in a way that was not Jewish . An even more ridiculous thought . <p> Bradley had abandoned the puzzle and left the room . Maybe Sylvia would say more . " Did you have lunch with him ? " Bobbie asked again . <p> But Sylvia would not be deterred . " Maybe Edwin has another girlfriend , " she said , " and this is her mixer . Hey , maybe he has a wife ! " She gave a short laugh . <p> " He has a mother . . . , " said Bobbie . His mother did n't sound like someone who 'd plug in a mixer and mix anything . She now remembered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipped . She looked , and this one was whole . She looked again . " I trust Edwin , " she said . <p> " I know you do . Boy , that would be something , " Sylvia said . " If it turned out Edwin was married . " <p> But Bobbie was experiencing one of those moments when one discovers the speed of thought by having several in an instant . First she felt ashamed of being stupid . Of course there had been plenty of hints that Edwin was married . Once she allowed herself to consider the possibility , she was sure it was so . Bobbie did n't need to know whose mixer it was to know that Edwin was married . Then , however , Bobbie felt something quite different . It was n't anger at Sylvia , at her sister 's gossipy curiosity . <p> She was not angry at Sylvia . She felt sorry for Sylvia , a little superior to Sylvia . All her life , Bobbie had known that Sylvia was smart , so Bobbie must be smart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth to the post office . Once they knew Edwin was married , Sylvia would imagine there was only one way to behave  --  to laugh bitterly  --  but Bobbie understood that there were two . <p> That there were two different ways to think about Edwin 's marriage  --  like thinking about the stars , which might be spots of light , close together , and might be distant , wild fireworlds  --  struck Bobbie with almost as much force as her sorrow . Sylvia 's way would be to laugh bitterly and tell everyone the story . Edwin 's marriage might be a bad joke on Bobbie , but then Edwin would no longer tip his chair against her sink , or walk her to her bed while his hands grasped all of her body he could reach under her loosened clothes . His marriage might be a bitter joke  --  or it might be something Bobbie just had to put up with . <p> Bobbie would never marry Edwin , but Bobbie had the mixer that worked . She stood and plugged it in , and it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd keep Edwin 's secret , not letting him know she knew  --  because it would scare him away  --  and not letting her sisters know she knew  --  because they 'd scream at her to forget him  --  became real in her mind , as if she could feel all their length , their loneliness , at once . She would be separated from Edwin , despite Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings . Bobbie turned off the mixer and wept . <p> " Oh , of course he 's not married , " Sylvia said , and Bobbie did n't say that was n't why she was crying . " Me and my big mouth , as usual , " Sylvia continued . She stood up and put her arms around Bobbie , and then the sisters were hugging and smiling . " Edwin married , " Sylvia said . " If there 's one man on earth who could n't manage being a two-timer , it 's Edwin . Sorry , baby , I love the guy , but that swift he 's not . " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her baby . Baby ! The unaccustomed sweetness , like the cookie , comforted Bobbie for a while . Maybe she and Sylvia both had secrets , like Edwin . Maybe life required secrets . What an idea . <p> <p> By Alice Mattison <p>
