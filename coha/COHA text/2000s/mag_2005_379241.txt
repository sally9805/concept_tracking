This month new mom Kate Hudson dabbles in folk magic in The Skeleton Key and lives a rocker 's life on tour with her husband 's band , the Black Crowes . <P> Did the movie make a voodoo or hoodoo convert of you ? <P> I knew a little bit about voodoo , mostly love-spell books I got from my girlfriends . I believe our minds are powerful enough to manifest whatever we 'd like . <P> Was a film set on a creepy plantation in New Orleans really the first place you wanted to take your newborn ? <P> It was challenging . You 'd hear a production assistant over the walkie-talkie yelling , " Does somebody have Kate 's breast milk on ice ? " <P> Have you reprised your groupie role from Cameron Crowe 's Almost Famous while on tour with your husband , Chris Robinson ? <P> Living on the road makes me realize how Cameron had it so perfectly : living in a bubble , involved in a family of musicians , roadies . Being in towns that are unbelievably boring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go bowling . <P> You said recently that you think monogamy is unrealistic . Would you mind if your husband had an affair ? <P> Oh , my God . I think I 'd mind . I mean , scientifically and animalistically it 's not realistic . Men look for nice , strong women to have children with , and that 's their instinct . I 'm not gon na put any pressures on my husband to be the perfect husband . If that 's something he had to do and that 's the kind of man he was , which he 's not , I just would n't want to know . <P> What 's a bohemian style do n't ? <P> If you 're not comfortable in it and it 's not your thing . And if you ca n't wear high boots over your jeans  --  if you do n't have the legs for it  --  just do n't do it .
