<p> Education is n't the fastest or easiest way to solve the world 's problems , but members of the All-USA College Academic First Team see it as the most effective one . <p> Collectively , the 20 undergraduates selected this year in USA TODAY 's student recognition program have worked or studied in such far-flung places as Thailand , Bosnia and Tanzania . And in extending their academic skills outside the classroom , many circle back to the importance of educating others , whether bringing Peruvian panpipe flute harmonies to Laramie , Wyo. , or wrestling with the global AIDS epidemic . <p> " This generation of leaders sees education as the most sustainable solution for the improvement of long-term global problems , " says team member Andrew Klaber , a Yale junior . <p> Klaber founded a non-profit corporation to provide scholarships for AIDS orphans in Thailand while spending last summer in the Chiang Mai province . He saw how the disease left so many children vulnerable to the drug and sex trades . The problems are interrelated , he says , but education will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . <p> " The temptations will always be there , " he says . " But educated people , people who know about the consequences of dangerous actions , can make truly informed choices . " <p> Klaber and the other 19 First Team members were selected from among nearly 500 undergraduates nationwide nominated by their schools . Two judging panels considered academics , leadership and activities . As representatives of all outstanding students , they receive trophies and $ 2,500 from USA TODAY . Forty more students are named to the Second and Third teams . <p> " These scholars have all excelled inside and outside the classroom . In furthering their own educations , they also are working on making the world a better place , " USA TODAY editor Karen Jurgensen says . <p> First Team members represent disciplines from literature to biology . Collectively , the 17 seniors and three juniors carry a 3.91 grade-point average . They are pursuing a total of 30 undergraduate majors , and two are earning graduate degrees concurrently . Outside the classroom , they make their marks in wide-ranging ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts Institute of Technology who holds two nanotechnology patents , to Michael Osofsky of Stanford , who interviewed more than 200 people who work on death row in Louisiana for research he presented to the American Psychological Association . <p> Whatever their courses of study , First Team members extend their education beyond the lab and library . And many have come to more fully understand the need to educate others around the world : <p> * Lisa Schwartz of Harvard started Justice For All to increase Bulgarians ' access to the justice system in the fledgling democracy . <p> Working with students , lawyers and academics in Bulgaria , Schwartz trained students to work with citizens and developed information packets to help citizens navigate the justice system . <p> " The best way for them to be able to trust the government is to be aware of what their rights are , knowing the correct way things are supposed to be done . " <p> * Aura Newlin went to Peru in 2001 to help research world flute music for a University of Wyoming book project and was swept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andes . <p> To the players , " their music was their identity . It was n't just that they played music , it was their life . " The music , in which the melody is shared between two parts , encourages community , and because you only play half the notes , it 's relatively easy to learn , she says . <p> Newlin co-founded and directs the 15-member Sikuris de Wyoming , which performs regionally and plans to play in South America 's largest panpipe festival next year . <p> Sharing other cultures is important in areas like Wyoming , where so many of the residents have n't traveled abroad , she says . " It makes foreign cultures more accessible and a little less scary . " <p> * Justin Kidd taught at a camp outside Sarajevo last summer through Project Bosnia , a service-learning program at the University of Denver . Teaching English , art and gym to Croatian and Bosnian kids , Kidd struggled to get them talking to each other until he had them read Romeo and Juliet and perform a simplified version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' a-ha ! ' moment for them , " says Kidd , who found that the feuding families got them talking honestly about their lives . " Seeing the spark go off in those kids made the summer worthwhile . " <p> Kidd had never thought to study abroad before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , but " it was glaringly apparent the tragedy happened because people did n't understand each other . " The only chance for harmony , he says , is planting the seeds of dialogue with youth . <p> " There are easier tasks , but I do n't think there 's a more important task , " he says . " It 's more important than ever after Sept. 11 . " <p> * And Rena Patel of the University of Illinois at Chicago held HIV/AIDS prevention workshops for thousands of young people in India and Tanzania . <p> For Patel , AIDS education goes far beyond clinical discussions . " What we 're really talking about is how to create choices and options . A lot of it is negative sexual activity , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expected to be vocal about their sexuality . How do you do that without becoming a social outcast ? " <p> Going abroad opened Patel 's eyes to issues in Chicago , where she designed culturally sensitive AIDS prevention workshops for Asian immigrants and Asian-American youth . Such efforts , she hopes , will also address some of the underlying social disparities . <p> Patel is n't the only First Team member working to educate others close to home . <p> * Dorothy Fink , a pre-med student at Georgetown , started a hands-on science program for pediatric cancer patients . Originally , Fink saw the program as fitting in with efforts to treat the whole patient rather than just the disease . But she found that experiments like " the science of soda " also teach kids about the science that is helping them get better . <p> " All of them are on different drugs , and each one has a mechanism of action , " she says . " The pH processes are governing how your body responds to things . " <p> * Lisa Hansen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researched and developed ways to teach earth science to visually impaired students . <p> Hansen , blind from birth until a cornea transplant restored partial sight in May , found herself at a great disadvantage while taking geology , with its rock and mineral identifications and maps . <p> Many of the modifications Hansen developed later in her research , such as using Elmer 's glue to raise lines on topographic maps , could work in any discipline , she says . And simply making sure you read aloud text presented on an overhead projector or PowerPoint presentation may help sighted auditory learners too , she says . <p> * Heidi Williams of Dartmouth , Bryan McLaughlin of Oklahoma State and Michelle Gentile of the University of Illinois at Chicago all developed programs to encourage children in math and science . <p> Gentile , working to improve the self-esteem of teens in state custody , hit upon the idea of using art to teach science to girls . " The scientific method in general , trying to look at something rationally and come to a conclusion based on an initial hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . We really push the connection . " <p> Williams , with her Sister to Sister mentoring , and McLaughlin , with Engineering Kids , both try to get kids interested in math before they have to choose between low- and high-level math courses . <p> " A lot of kids do n't know a lot about math and science and never consider it as a potential career because they were never good at it , " says McLaughlin , who performs experiments as " Dr. Snookers . " <p> Sister to Sister , a mentoring program and conference for girls at 10 middle schools , has evolved to encompass issues like body image and self-esteem . For Williams , developing relationships is as important as any knowledge imparted . <p> " Part of it is selfish , " she says . " I really enjoy being an active part of student learning and student development . " <p> Indeed , whether First Team members are educating others in their own communities or around the world , they find that quite often , they benefit most . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' people-making experience , ' " Patel says . " I did n't just want to have the university spit me out as a degree holder . " All-USA College Academic Team
