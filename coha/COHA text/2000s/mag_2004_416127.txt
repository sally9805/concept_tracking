Photograph left : Before , even a large picture window did n't bring enough light into the room . To brighten it , the designer used artwork , fabrics , and accessories to weave warm colors throughout . // While working with the Idea House program for several years , I had the opportunity to meet many talented designers across the South . In 2001,1 hired Grant Ray to design the interiors of the Poplar Grove Idea House . His attention to detail on that project always left me wondering what his own house looked like . So I decided to find out and share it with you . Grant lived a few doors down from this Tudor Revivalstyle house when it came on the market . He was n't looking to move , but from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew it had potential , but the home also needed some serious sprucing up . Its location on a shaded lot did n't do much for brightening the interiors , especially with dark paint colors and stained wood covering the walls . When the price was right , Grant bought the house and quickly set a plan in motion to shed light on the home , starting with the living room . So , how did this interior designer choose to update the largest space in his new house ? Take a look .

The beige and red colors work well with the room 's other furnishings . // 1 Pick the Right Paint The before picture speaks for itself . Even with the centrally located large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark color scheme made the space drab and dated . For an easy , inexpensive fix , Grant chose a soft beige wall color to pair with creamy white trim . The combination instantly updated the space and created a neutral palette to build upon . Prior to the update , the fireplace was n't a focal point . The brick surround blended in with the cranberry-colored walls and stained trim . Now , the lighter walls and mantel make the fireplace stand out as an architectural element in the room . 2 Arrange Furniture for Intimate Seating The generous dimensions of this living room might send a homeowner into a tizzy , wondering , " Where does the furniture go ? " Grant solved the problem by dividing the space . He created cozy seating by the fireplace and a secondary group at the far end of the room . A table placed directly behind the sofa marks the end of one area , while the red-leather French chairs start another . The multiple seating areas create a traffic pattern as well . With this arrangement , there 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and kitchen . 3 Add a Ribbon of Color " Grant made only a few purchases for the new house . A pair of lounge chairs in a festive red , quilted cotton fabric adds a dash of color . The hue creates a rhythm throughout the room and appears in other elements , such as pillows and artwork . The chairs are balanced with a small-scale chenille sofa . Because it 's only a two-seater , Grant chose not to fill the sofa with pillows . Instead , he placed a cashmere throw on the back to add color and pattern . This style trick works best on tight-backed sofas such as this one . Asian garden stools , used as end tables , are just the right size to place a drink , but can also be used as additional seating when entertaining . 4 Be Finicky With Fabrics Furniture placement is key , but so is the fabric that 's used on each piece . Because the walls are neutral-colored , Grant uses textiles to add interest to the room . He blends velvet , chenille , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . Remember : The feel of the fabric is just as important as the color . 5 Learn Bookshelf Basics Do n't let a wall of bookshelves send you into accessory overdrive . Grant suggests using monochromatic items for a strong statement . He combines inexpensive knickknacks , such as rattan trays , with a few jewels , such as the antique leather-bound books . Keeping like tones draws your eye to the entire bookshelf , not to just one item . 6 Select Memorable Art Go ahead and try oversize artwork or architectural elements . In the right place , a big piece will make an even bigger impression . Most designers have a passion for original artwork , and Grant is no exception . His unique collection speaks volumes about his style ; each piece has a personal story or unique history behind it . Whether it simply caught his eye or was purchased on one of his many trips , the artwork gives this room an edge . The combination of traditional and contemporary items keeps the space fresh .
