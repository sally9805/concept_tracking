In his 1939 novel Ask The Dust , John Fante looked at the folks around him in Los Angeles and saw " faces with the blood drained away , tight faces , worried , lost . Faces like flowers torn from their roots and stuffed into a pretty vase , the colors draining fast . " <P> Fante 's novel was a dirge-hymn to L.A. at the time when the first wave of immigrants , teeming west from the plains and north from Mexico , collided in a movie dream gone sour . Published to little note , it slowly found important devotees . Charles Bukowski , L.A. 's signature outlaw author , used to channel the book 's hero , shouting " I am Bandini , Arturo Bandini ! " Screenwriter Robert Towne fell in love with the book when researching his script for Chinatown , also set in the ' 30s . Now , a generation later , he has made an elegiac movie of Ask the Dust . <P> Bandini ( Colin Farrell ) is a writer who knows his subject  --  L.A.  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long : strong-willed women keep showing up unbidden in his room , removing their clothes , tangling him in their sad fates . Vera ( Idina Menzel ) , who loves Bandini 's writing , needs someone to tend her wounds . Camilla ( Salma Hayek ) , a Chicano waitress who ca n't read his words but has great body English , starts to lure Bandini away from his obsession with those beautiful golden-haired California girls . <P> Fante has a kindred spirit in Towne , whose scripts for Shampoo , The Two Jakes , Tequila Sunrise and other films create nearly as dense an overview of Southern California as August Wilson did of Pittsburgh , Pa . And Towne was lucky in his casting of Hayek , who always smolders intelligently , and Farrell . The actor can be roguish , annoying , sexy , loving and lost  --  Bandini to a T. Towne is more trusting of them than he is of the book 's plot ; toward the end he seems to mistake Fante 's Camilla for Garbo 's Camille . But the moments the olive-skinned lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The rest is a fairly stately , sometimes stilted evocation of antique attitudes and older , better movies . The torpid pace and expertly muted cinematography ( by Caleb Deschanel ) inevitably suggest the fading fragrance of those flowers Fante described . Ask the Dust is the ghost of a cult novel ; it ca n't bring itself to life .
