<p> A guitar starts slowly , the strumming building in intensity . A singer emerges , lamenting lost love , pain , death . Suddenly a dancer appears , and another , and amid staccato hand-clapping and shouted lyrics , the stage is a frenzy of whipping skirts and pencil-thin men . This can only be flamenco . <p> The Spanish art form has a rich history in the Bay Area , hitting its peak in popularity during the 1950s and early ' 60s . San Francisco 's North Beach was the hot spot , with venues such as the Old Spaghetti Factory , La Bodega and Casa Madrid cultivating local talents as well as imports from Spain . But the cultural revolution of the late ' 60s changed the city 's landscape . The bohemian center moved from North Beach to the Haight and forged the slow decline of flamenco 's popularity . <p> " The Beat Generation helped it , and flower power killed it , " said Ernesto Hernandez , 66 , a dancer with Los Flamencos de la Bodega company . But flamenco did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Flamenco is experiencing a resurgence in the Bay Area , with a dedicated following filling up dinner shows and theater performances year-round . Much of its success can be attributed to a tight little community that pushes the limits of its art form by working together and learning from each other . <p> " It inspires me , " said dancer Monica , who like many of her peers goes by a singular stage name . " You get to see the different styles . With different people rotating in all the time , it keeps the performances fresh . Everybody brings a different feeling . " <p> Flamenco has been a Sunday night fixture at Timo 's restaurant in San Francisco the past three years . Owner Carlos Corredor says flamenco 's flavor matches that of his Hispanic cuisine 's , and he gives the shows full support although they are not moneymakers . <p> " I like what it 's added to the restaurant , " he said . " When we started , it was an expense , but now it 's paying for itself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> Regular sold-out performances are also held in San Francisco at the new La Bodega and the ODC Theatre ; and Le Petit Trianon Theater in San Jose . In recent weeks , shows have been performed at the Mark Hopkins Hotel , Montero 's Club in Albany and Cafe de la Paz in Berkeley as well as Cal Performances ' Flamenco Festival USA , which featured two of the world 's great flamenco dancers . <p> Flamenco evolved in the 16th century from Gypsys who fled to the Andalusian mountains in Spain to escape religious persecution . They expressed their frustrations and sense of isolation through song . The guitar was added centuries later and the dance  --  the discipline most associated with flamenco  --  even later . <p> According to many Bay Area performers , flamenco 's recent renaissance can be attributed to the popularity of acts such as the Gipsy Kings and Ottmar Liebert in the early 1990s . The Bay Area 's diverse population , which has opened its mind and ears to world music , has embraced the revival . <p> Guitarist Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often sit in with each other to jam . <p> " We show up to work and do n't have to worry who else is playing , " he said . " You 're not stuck in a band-type situation , with the same lineup . You work with the same people , but in different combinations . The rotation makes things interesting for us , and I 'm sure for the audience , too . " <p> Many of the performers also teach their respective art forms at dance schools and their own studios . Enrollment has increased in recent years . Yaelisa , for example , began in 1996 teaching dance once a week to a class of 15 to 20 students . She now teaches eight to 10 classes of up to 25 people . <p> " I have classes at three different levels , " said Yaelisa , who with her husband , McGuire , runs the Yaelisa and Caminos Flamenco company . " They 're all packed . I teach music appreciation , communication with musicians . They want to learn all aspects of the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different collaborations forge something unique and unexpected in each show . <p> At one recent full-house evening at Timo 's , Monica was not on the flamenco bill , but she dropped in to perform her duties as show organizer . She arrived in street clothes , her winter coat draped over her left arm . Her unexpected appearance elicited whispers among the late-dining patrons , many of whom recognized her as a frequent headliner at the restaurant . She stepped out of view and reappeared in the middle of the second set , this time in a fire-red gown with ruffles , her jet-black hair pulled back . She joined two other dancers in clapping out a rhythm as a palmista before taking center stage for a solo . <p> With little verbal communication , Monica , singer Patricia Velasquez and McGuire improvised a number that was met with rousing approval by the crowd . Not a single beat was missed . Everyone , including the audience , was in rhythm . <p> " With flamenco you can really express yourself , " said dancer Carola . " You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perfect at practice , but at the moment ( of performance ) everything changes . . . . It 's never finished . There 's always something new . " <p> A guitar 's jaunty introduction might convey joy , which the singer might then transform through words and tone into melancholy . The dancer 's movements might drop the mood further into depression , before all three conspire to bring it full circle with an exuberant conclusion . <p> " Flamenco in its true essence is about communication , " said Yaelisa , whose flamenco genes are inherited from her mother , Isa Mura , who started with Los Flamencos de la Bodega . <p> Every year during the fall or winter , Yaelisa 's company hosts one of the West Coast 's largest flamenco festivals at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts . It is adding a spring season in April this year . <p> Theatre Flamenco , the oldest company on the West Coast , has presented seasonal performances since 1966 . <p> But the best performances are often held out of the public 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant or theater show might be , it often can not compare with the performances at juergas . The flamencos gather for the private parties after shows or on other special occasions . Without the pressure of having to perform for an audience , they let loose in the relaxed setting . There is more improvisation and experimentation than usual . <p> " They 're huge celebrations , " said singer Velasquez . " You invite one flamenco , and he invites one or two and they invite one or two and it becomes a real juerga . It might last until 6 in the morning . The song never ends , and there 's music , music , music .
