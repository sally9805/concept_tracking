<p> He was the 6-year-old kid who sat on his father 's lap when then Washington Bullets general manager Bob Ferry scouted talent for the team . He was the 8-year-old kid Wes Unseld used to dangle over the Bullets ' practice court . He was the 11-year-old kid who upset his big brother by dressing " Bullets , " the family dog , in a team sweater the night Washington beat Seattle in Game 7 of the NBA Finals in 1978 . <p> And now he is the 39-year-old kid who has followed his father into the family business  --  running a professional basketball team . " I 'm not really surprised , no , " Bob Ferry said by phone when asked about his son 's professional pursuits . " He grew up around the game . " <p> When Cleveland Cavaliers General Manager Danny Ferry was born in 1966 , it 's a wonder his parents did n't take him home in a peach basket . Bob Ferry was general manager of the Bullets for 17 years , so it was nothing for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea how it would later impact his youngest son and help change the face of franchises in Washington and Cleveland , where the Wizards ( 5-1 ) face the Cavaliers ( 5-2 ) tonight at Quicken Loans Arena . <p> Danny Ferry would often rebound shots for Unseld or Mitch Kupchak , eavesdrop on conversations his dad had with other executives or even sit in on lunches his father had with Boston Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach . " At the dinner table , often , players were talked about . Coaches . It was part of our household conversations , " said Bob Ferry , who won NBA executive of the year for the 1978-79 and 1981-82 seasons . " I do n't think I realized how much he was listening . I tried to keep the basketball end out of our family as much as I could , but I just could n't help it . " <p> Growing up in Bowie , Danny Ferry received a basketball education most children would envy , but he does n't believe it made him more qualified or more prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a little different than most other GMs . But it 's part of the equation , " Ferry said . " I was n't going to GM school at the time . I was just growing up . I was being a son , tagging along with my dad just like other kids do . " <p> Ferry was a high school national player of the year at DeMatha , where he learned from the legendary Morgan Wootten , college national player of the year at Duke , where he learned from Mike Krzyzewski , and a solid NBA role-player for 13 years in Cleveland and San Antonio . He said all of his experiences in basketball have added up to his life taking this route , but noted that a career in basketball was the furthest thing from his mind as a child . <p> " I never even thought about it , " Ferry said . " When I was playing as a kid , I never dreamt that I would be an NBA player . I just wanted to play . I did n't really start thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never said , ' Hey I want to be in the front office . ' But toward the end of my career , I thought , ' That might be interesting . ' " <p> San Antonio Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich said he noticed that Ferry had the chops to succeed in the front office during Ferry 's last three seasons in San Antonio . " As a player , he was one of those no-brainers , like Avery Johnson . He understood the game . He knew what was going on . He could make adjustments in the game , just like any of us coaches , " Popovich said . " You could see he was highly intelligent . " <p> While the Spurs were headed toward their second NBA title in 2003 , Popovich and Spurs General Manager R.C. Buford approached Ferry about trying another side of basketball . Ferry said he did n't have to think too hard about staying in San Antonio , given his family 's affinity for the area and his chance to be around the model organization in the NBA . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spurs , the Cavaliers offered Ferry the opportunity to become the NBA 's youngest general manager and build a winning team  --  with the NBA 's would-be king , LeBron James , and $28 million in salary cap space . <p> Ferry labored over the decision until the day after the Spurs ' championship parade . " The opportunity was one that if I did n't take , it would 've been too many ' what ifs , ' " said Ferry , who joined the Cavaliers a day before the draft , a few days before the free agent recruiting period . " I took this job because of the challenge . There is an inherent pressure that this job has , but again , that 's part of the reason I took it . It gets your blood pumping a little bit . " <p> And , whenever he needs help , Ferry does n't have to look far . " My dad 's given me advice . But he 's stepped back . I do n't think he wants to stand over my shoulder , " said Ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some scouting for the Cavaliers . " It 'll be fun doing this with him in some regard , but I 'm not going to have him move to Cleveland . " <p> Bob Ferry , who took over as general manager of the Bullets when he was just 33 , said he can find several parallels with his son . When Bob Ferry was hired , the Bullets already had a coach in K.C. Jones . When Danny Ferry was hired , the Cavaliers already had a coach in Mike Brown . " I would say there were times when I thought , ' What did I get myself into ? ' " said Bob Ferry , who had a 10-year playing career with the St. Louis Hawks , Detroit Pistons and Baltimore Bullets . " But I would say we were similar . I think both of us took a job that we had to do . We both were presented with great opportunity . And had to figure out how to do it . The easy decision for him would 've been to stay in San Antonio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have complained if Danny Ferry had stayed . " To date , we have n't really replaced him yet , " Popovich said . " We have n't found anybody for his slot , because we have n't found his equal . I think the Cavaliers are lucky to get somebody that savvy , that intelligent . He 's going to do a great job . " <p> When Danny Ferry reeled in his first big catch in free agency last summer , he was somewhat conflicted . While thrilled about plucking guard Larry Hughes away from the Washington Wizards and giving James an explosive running mate , Ferry did n't want it to look like he was declaring war on an old family friend ; especially when that old friend  --  81-year-old Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin  --  had recently been hospitalized for heart bypass surgery . So , shortly after he signed Donyell Marshall , another free agent the Wizards pursued , Ferry called his father . " He 's like , ' Dad , I really feel funny about all this . You know how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said by phone recently . Danny " was very worried and concerned that he might be taking something from Mr. Pollin . " <p> To understand why an NBA general manager would be concerned about upsetting the owner of an opposing team , you 'd have to understand that Danny Ferry 's roots with the local 12 run deep . " I felt that maybe Pollin thought I was going out and attacking the Wizards , which was n't the case , " Ferry said . " But no , I did n't feel guilt . It 's part of the sport , part of the game . I think getting Larry is a good thing for our organization , with the focus of winning . Along with that , I think the Wizards have made out well with the moves they made this offseason . Things have worked out well for us . They 've worked out well for the Wizards . "
