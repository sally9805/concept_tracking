Wet . I never felt so wet . I was soaked . Trying to make myself smaller , I hunched my shoulders and leaned to the right . A rivulet of water streamed down from the big limb above my head . The drops hit smack-dab between my shoulder blades . Leaning to the left , I got away from that stream , but more water leaked from a knot on the other side of the limb . It hit right between my ears , trickled down to the tip of my snout , and dripped off my whiskers . Beneath this huge tree was the driest spot I had found . Even so , I was still drenched  --  soaked clear to the skin . Water even dripped from my tummy , adding to the puddle at my feet . I could n't understand . My boy would never leave me out here ... not all night ... not all alone .... We played chase in the backyard . He petted me and hugged me . I licked his face and ears and he laughed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never desert me . Just then a big drop of rain hit right inside my ear . I flinched and shook my head . It was n't my boy . It was the daddy . He was the one who brought me here . The day had started out okay . My boy fed me , petted me , and we 'd had a little romp . When my boy left for school , the daddy put me on my leash and we went for a drive in the car . I should have known then , because there was something different about the way he acted . Something strange and unusual . Besides that , my boy was n't with us . He was always there when we went for a ride . I sat in the backseat and watched the road . Things did n't look familiar when we stopped . The daddy took my collar off and let me run . But when I came back tothe car ... the car was gone . Maybe I romped and played too long . Maybe I did n't come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , I sat and waited and waited and waited . I just knew he would n't leave me . The first night was really bad . When I was little I 'd slept in a big basket with my mother and brothers and sisters . When my boy took me to live with him , I had to sleep outside . I had my own doghouse , though , and there was a big fence to keep all the nighttime scaries from getting too close . Out here , I was all alone with no place to hide . Then it got worse . It started to rain . Two days and one night the rain fell . Still I waited . I just knew they would come for me . Cold , miserable , scared , and lonely , I waited . Now ... I 'd waited long enough . It was time to move on . Someone growled at me . It snapped me from my thoughts and made me jump . The growl came again , but this time I realized that it was n't someone growling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy heart ( not to mention my heavy wet fur ) I knew it was time to go . I could n't wait any longer . As I walked I looked for anything familiar . When the rain finally stopped , I did n't . I kept walking . Never slowing down , I sniffed for those special scents of home . They were n't there . What I did smell was kind of interesting , though . It was like the car and the trash and metal and ... well , it reeked of everything all jumbled together . I followed the aroma to a big chain-link fence . It was like the one in my backyard , only taller . The top had wire wrapped around it . I had never seen anything quite like it . There was stuff piled everywhere . My nose wiggled as I whiffed along the edge of the fence . With all that junk and trash , there had to be something in there to eat . " Get away from here , you mangy mutt ! " a short black dog snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your way . I have work to do . " " Chill , mister , I 'm just looking . Besides I do n't know how to get in there anyway . " I stared at the white teeth that shined back at me . " I 'm serious . You 'd better get away from here . I mean it ! " The dog 's ears flattened against his head and his eyes narrowed . At the same time , though , his tail was wagging . He stuck his nose through one of the chain-link squares . My tail started wagging , too . I leaned down and licked his nose with my pink tongue . " Hey , stop that ! " His light brown eyebrows crooked as he stepped back and growled again . The fur on his neck stood out to make him look bigger . I dropped my head to stare him in the eye . " You need to calm down . You 're going to wear out the fur on your neck . " " Get real ! If I let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got work to do . " The dog stepped back up to the fence and sniffed at me . I licked his face again . " Hey , what 's your name , anyway ? " I asked . " Which name do you want ? " " You have more than one name ? How did that happen ? " " Well , these guys call me Spike . But my first name was April . " My nose twitched and my ears perked up . " April ? That 's a funny name for a boy dog . " " Yeah , maybe , but I kind of like it . This little kid gave me that name . She was pretty sweet to me . She was a bit rough , I guess , but nothing compared to Roy . He is just mean ! " The dog sat down on his haunches and relaxed . " What should I call you ? " I twitched my ears at him . " Better call me Spike . If Tiger hears anyone call me April , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out , crossed his front legs , then dropped his head to rest on his paws . " Who 's Tiger ? " I asked . " Tiger is the Junkyard Dog . He is really mean . Roy has been poking him with a stick and kicking him forever . So he got his attitude adjusted a long time ago . Roy is working on me , but I 'm not mean yet . He says that I 'll get there , though . " Spike scooted on the ground until his nose touched the fence . " By the way , what 's your name ? " " Freddie . Call me Freddie . " I closed my eyes .... The boy had picked me special . I was the third one to leave the litter . He had looked me all over and declared , " You are Fred D. Fluff Dog ! I will love you forever . " That was before the car ride . The ride that got me here ... the junkyard .... " Just call me Freddie . " I sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddie . " My ears drooped . My stomach grumbled . From the back of the yard a big yellow dog came running at us . " Spike , what are you doing ? Run that white pile of fluff away from here . You are n't doing your job . Get busy ! Get rid of that mutt ! " I could see the dog 's huge muscles under his short golden hair . Black stripes stretched across his chest and back . Spike sprang to his feet and spun to face him . " I ... er , I ... ah ... thought that was only people that we had to keep away , " he stammered . " This is just a dog ! " My new friend looked sort of small and helpless as he stood next to the other dog . " What are you thinking ? One more dog around here , and we wo n't get anything to eat . We barely get enough as it is . Get rid of him . Now ! " Tiger snapped his strong jaws at Spike 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluff ball , " Spike growled at me . Then he winked . " Go around the corner and wait , " he whispered softly so Tiger could n't hear . I looked into his narrowed eyes , flipped my tail , and ran out of sight . Hiding behind some wooden boxes , I waited for some kind of signal . It was n't long before I heard a friendly yip . Carefully peeking around the edge of the boxes , I kept my ears low in case Tiger was still there . Spike stood next to the fence . " It 's okay , " he said with a wag of his tail . " Tiger has gone on patrol . I 'm supposed to keep you away . Just make sure that you watch out for him . It takes quite a while for Tiger to get all the way around the whole yard . What are you doing here , anyway ? You look like somebody has been taking care of you . " Spike stretched out and touched his nose against the fence . I shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Spike arched an eyebrow . " What happened ? " " I do n't know . I thought the daddy was taking me for a car ride . I got out for a run , and when I came back ... " My head drooped when I thought about it . " Yeah , you got dumped , all right ! It happens to the best of us . Things are going along just dandy , and the next thing you know ... dumped did n't do anything . My boy and I were happy together . He loved me . I am sure of it . " My heart raced as I remembered the feeling I had when the car did n't come back for me . " You did n't have to do anything ! Stuff just happens . Something went wrong with them . Your boy probably still loves you . It 's his parents with the problem . Who knows . You got ta live for the day . " Spike reached up to scratch his belly with his hind leg . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had minded them better . I got along great with my boy . Maybe I dug too many holes in the yard . Maybe I barked too much . " I sagged to the ground and rested my nose against the fence . " Yeah , maybe , but quit worrying about it . People are just like that . Sometimes there 's no reason at all . You ca n't trust people . At least you are free . Look at the mess I 'm in . You are the first dog that I have had a chance to talk to . Tiger wo n't even play chase with me . Well , he does , but he bites me if he catches me  --  really hard . If you think you have it bad , you need to be in my yard for a while . " " How could it be worse ? " I sighed . " One day I have a warm house in a nice safe yard . A boy and toys to play with . Then ... I get dumped . " Spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like a growl . " You think you got it bad ? Well , just let me tell you about bad .... "
