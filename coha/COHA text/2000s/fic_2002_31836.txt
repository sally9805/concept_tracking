Chapter One : The Catch I 'm Jake , Jake Drake . I 'm in fourth grade , and I 'm ten years old . And I have to tell the truth about something : I 've been crazy about computers all my life . My first computer was an old Mac Classic with a black-and-white screen . I got to play Reader Rabbit and Magic Math . I got to draw pictures on the screen , and I played Battle Tanks . And that was before I could even read . Then our family got a Mac with a big color monitor . And I got to play Tetris and Shanghai and Solitaire and Spectre . Then I got a joystick for Christmas when I was four , and so did my best friend , Willie . Whenever Willie came to my house we played computer games together . It 's not we like played computers all the time , because my mom made a one-hour-a-day rule at my house . But Willie and I filled up that hour almost every day . Then the computers started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drummer , and then SimCity , and SimAnt , and PGA Golf , and about ten other games . And then the Internet arrived at my house , and all of a sudden I could make my computer do some pretty amazing stuff . It was like a magic window . I 'm telling all of this because if I do n't , then the rest of this story makes me look like a real jerk . And I 'm not a jerk , not most of the time . I just really like computers . When I started kindergarten , there was a computer in our room . When the teacher saw I was good on it , I got to use it . I even got to teach other kids how to use it . Except for Kevin and Marsha . They did n't want me to tell them about computers or anything else . Like I said before , I 'm ten now , so I 've had some time to figure out some stuff . And one thing I know for sure is this : There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . I 'm pretty smart , and I like being smart . And almost all the kids I know , they 're pretty smart , too . But some kids , they have to prove they 're smart . Like , all the time . And not just smart . They have to be the smartest . And that 's what Marsha and Kevin are like . Marsha McCall and Kevin Young were nice enough kids back in kindergartenas long as I did n't try to tell them anything about the computer . Because when I tried to show Kevin how to make shapes with the drawing program , he said , " I know that . " But I do n't think he really did . And when I tried to show Marsha how to print out a picture of a kitten , she said , " I can do that myself . " But a lot of the time Kevin and Marsha were pretty nice because kindergarten was mostly playtime . But when we got to first grade , school changed . All of a sudden there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they went nuts about getting the right answers . But it was worse than that . They both wanted to get the right answer first . It was like they thought school was a TV game show . If you get the right answer first , you win the big prize . Anyway , they both turned into know-it-alls . Our first-grade teacher was Miss Grimes . Every time she asked a question , Marsha would start shaking all over and waving her hand around and whispering really loud , like this : " Ooh , ooh ! I know ! I know ! I know ! " And while Marsha was going , " Ooh , ooh , " Kevin looked like his arm was going to pull his whole body right out of his chair and drag it up to the ceiling , like his arm had its own brain or something . It was pretty awful . But Miss Grimes , she liked it when Kevin and Marsha tried to be the best at everything . She liked seeing who could get done first with a math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spelling quiz line up first for lunch or recess . First grade felt like a big contest , and Miss Grimes smiled at the winners and frowned at the losers . When she asked the class a question , most of the time Miss Grimes called on Marsha first . If Marsha was slow or did n't know something , then Kevin got a turn . If Kevin messed up , then she would call on someone else . And I think I know why Miss Grimes always called on Marsha and Kevin . I think it 's because she 's kind of a know-it-all herself . I bet she was just like Marsha back when she was in first grade . Second grade was n't much better . The only good thing was that my second-grade teacher was n't like Miss Grimes . Mrs. Brattle did n't want school to be a big contest . So she hardly ever called on the know-it-alls . All year long , Mrs. Brattle kept saying stuff like , " Kevin and Marsha , please look around at all the other students in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just put your hands down for now . " That did n't stop Kevin and Marsha . The " ooh-oohing " and the arm waving never let up . But last year , when I was in third grade , that 's when things got out of control . And I guess it was partly my fault . And Mrs. Snavin , my third-grade teacher ? She had something to do with it . And so did the principal , Mrs. Karp . And so did this guy named Mr. Lenny Cordo over at Wonky 's Super Computer Store . He had a lot to do with it . Because Mr. Lenny Cordo came to my school one day back when I was in third grade . And Mr. Lenny Cordo told me that he had a present for me . Something really wonderful . Something I had been wishing for . But there was one small catch . Because there 's always at least one small catch . And this was the catch : Before Mr. Lenny Cordo could give me this wonderful thing that I wanted so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn myself into Jake Drake , Know-It-All.
