<p> Treatment for kids , too <p> Re : ' Pioneering center in Denver to treat severe eating disorders , ' March 24 news story . <p> Having had personal experience with an eating disorder for eight years , I was pleased to hear that the Denver Health Medical Center will be opening an intensive care treatment center for those with eating disorders . <p> However , The Post 's story said that doctors claim the ACUTE Medical Center is the only place in the country where patients can get ' round-the-clock treatment and monitoring in an intensive-care setting - in the same place and at the same time they undergo therapy . ' <p> This may be true for adult eating-disorder patients , but the same kind of intensive , eating-disorder-specific treatment exists for adolescents and young adults up to age 22 at The Children 's Hospital in Denver . The eating disorders program , headed by Jennifer Hagman , M.D. , is known around the country . It saved my life and the lives of many other young adults . <p> GABRIELLE DEVENISH <p> Lakewood <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning , ' March 22 editorial . <p> Although it does n't make the headlines in The Denver Post and other newspapers around the country , NASA is working tirelessly to implement the Columbia Accident Investigation Board 's safety recommendations . In concert with our return to flight activities , we also have another group of talented engineers working to develop other options besides a manned shuttle servicing mission to extend the service life of the Hubble Space Telescope . We have not given up on Hubble , contrary to The Post 's assertions . <p> Since there are three or four years until Hubble 's support systems give out , we have the time and the resident engineering talent to examine those other options . Our outstanding Hubble team is now working hard to explore the option of a robotic mission to at least keep the Hubble operating through the end of the decade . <p> At the urging of some members of Congress , we 've enlisted the assistance of the National Academy of Sciences and welcome their input to extend Hubble 's service life . Meanwhile , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service life , the capabilities of the Chandra , Spitzer and upcoming Kepler and James Webb space telescopes combined with an array of ground instruments will keep the astronomy observations flowing for a long time to come . <p> SEAN O'KEEFE , Administrator <p> National Aeronautics and <p> Space Administration <p> Washington , D.C. <p>  --  Story mischaracterized oral , maxillofacial surgeons <p> Re : ' Dentists moving beyond mouths , ' March 23 news story . <p> On behalf of the Colorado Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons , the national association that represents 7,000 oral and maxillofacial surgeons , we protest the gross inaccuracies in your article . <p> Omitted was any reference to the rigorous training required of oral and maxillofacial surgeons ( OMS 's ) , which includes four years of dental school and minimum of four to seven years of surgical training in a hospital residency . A number of <p> OMS 's also obtain M.D. degrees . During their training , OMS residents provide surgical care and services alongside residents in reconstructive and elective cosmetic surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's do not perform full body procedures such as ' tummy tucks and breast augmentation ' unless those procedures are within their education and training , i.e. they have obtained a medical license and additional residency training in plastic surgery and full body procedures . <p> Further , no OMS would perform facial cosmetic procedures or other such procedure unless he or she meets the AAOMS 's cosmetic credentialing standards requiring completion of an accredited residency training program in OMS and hospital privileges to perform facial cosmetic procedures . Significantly , these national credentialing standards meet or exceed those of other specialties who perform these procedures , including plastic surgeons . <p> Your article also implied that the qualifications of OMS 's were somehow suspect because they are not board-certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties . OMS 's are board-certified by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery , which has been in existence for more than 50 years , requires the same high training and residency standards , and is recognized as a bona fide certifying board by most state laws and hospital credentialing committees . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require Level I and II hospital trauma centers to have <p> OMS 's on call to perform reconstructive surgeries of the mouth , face and jaws . <p> Also of concern is The Post 's erroneous interpretation of a bill in the Colorado legislature to reestablish the dental examiners ' board . The article states , ' At issue is the expansion of the scope of practice from ' oral cavity ' to the ' body . " This suggests that passage of the bill would allow OMS 's to perform full body procedures . This is a deliberate attempt to pander to the anti-competitive agenda of plastic surgeons at the expense of OMS 's , who have an exemplary record of providing safe and successful procedures . The actual text of the bill comes directly from the American Dental Association 's definition of dentistry , which has passed in 15 states since 1997 and is pending if 15 others . It reads as follows : <p> ' Dentistry is defined as the evaluation , diagnosis , prevention and/or treatment of diseases , disorders and/or conditions of the oral cavity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on the human body ; provided by a dentist , within the scope of his/her education , training and experience , in accordance with the ethics of the profession and applicable law . ' <p> The Post 's article does a disservice to the entire specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery , to the medical colleagues who count on us , and to our patients . <p> BOYD TOMASETTI , D.M.D. <p> Littleton <p> STEVEN NELSON , D.D.S. <p> Denver <p> ELGAN STAMPER , D.D.S. <p> Glendale , Calif . <p> Dr. Tomasetti is past president of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons ; Dr. Nelson is a practicing oral and maxillofacial surgeon ; and Dr. Stamper is president of the AAOMS . <p> ( Editor 's note : The Post published a correction on Page 2B of today 's editions . ) <p> Finally , an apology <p> Re : ' Warning came a week before 9/11 ; Clarke told Rice al-Qaeda could kill hundreds , ' March 25 news story . <p> Former U.S. counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke said Wednesday before the Sept. 11 commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you failed you and I failed you . ' <p> Finally , after waiting two and a half years , the Sept. 11 victims ' families received an apology for the failure to prevent the attacks . <p> Of the few legitimate functions that the federal government is supposed to perform , national defense ranks near the top . Our federal government officials have not been held to account for the tragedy that occurred on Sept. 11 . <p> Those individuals responsible for this serious dereliction of duty ought to be prosecuted and jailed for these failings . <p> JAMES FRYE <p> Aurora <p> A reasonable approach <p> The congressional hearings related to whether the existing and previous administrations could have prevented Sept. 11 certainly come as no surprise during an election year using the typical reactive approach . However , the United States could really assert its position in the world if such hearings would be not only backward-looking but forward-looking , as well . We have a tendency to only live in the past . Being more proactive in planning our future with respect to homeland security can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . I do n't see any problem with bipartisan efforts to re-engineer our homeland security program from time to time . Homeland security and its makeup were developed under the Republicans ' watch . Not that there is anything wrong with their approach , but we have a lot of really smart people in Washington from both parties who can contribute to the process . However , both political parties ( John Kerry , are you listening ? ) would have to grow up a bit to make this a reasonable approach . <p> KEN KLOSKA <p> Morrison <p> Sense of contradiction <p> The tough talk by Bush administration personnel regarding the elimination of terrorist threats now being bantered before the Sept. 11 commission creates a sense of contradiction when compared to the weak-kneed response to Israel 's thankful elimination of Sheik Ahmed Yassin . Although Yassin easily measures up to the despicable model of Osama bin Laden , whose elimination reflects a great urgency , news of Yassin 's destruction brought the astonishing response from the Bush administration that ' we are deeply disturbed .
