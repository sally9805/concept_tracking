" When I discover who I am , I 'll be free . " - Ralph Ellison // From This Day Forward // It was a beautiful day for a wedding . The church was packed with happy family and friends . The bride was stunning in an ivory satin wedding dress , the groom elegant in a fitted black tuxedo . The wedding party circled them in a color-coordinated cloud of taffeta and tails . As the couple stood before the silver-haired minister , they gazed deeply into each other 's eyes . Then they each spoke the vows they had written themselves : // " You will be my best friend , " she pledged , " except for Marcia , who will always be my very , very best friend . And my German shepherd , Spike , who will sleep at the foot of our bed . " // " I promise to take care of you and want only what 's good for you , " he replied , " as long as it works for me and does n't involve frequent visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for who you are , " she said , " but once we 're married , I 'll expect you to drink less , work harder , start showing an interest in the arts , and shave off that beard . " // " What is mine will be yours , " he responded , " except for the money you do n't know about and the cash I 'll sock away in a private account , just in case things do n't work out . " // " I promise to love you unconditionally , " she said , " until you do something I find intolerable ; to forgive and forget , although you know I come from a family of championship grudge-holders ; and to never go to sleep angry , although I may have to stay awake all night fuming. " // " I 'll adore you forever , in body and soul , " he said , " as long as you keep that gorgeous size-six figure . " // " I promise to cherish you every day for as long as we both shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyous tears . " Or as long as I can stand to put up with you . " // This exchange may sound comical , but often as I am counseling troubled couples , I find that similar thoughts and " but-ifs " were lingering just beneath the surface of their wedding vows . They made promises they could not keep and said flowery words they did not fully understand or believe , hoping that the magical aura of their lavish wedding would carry them through their lives and make everything okay . // What was going on ? They were lying at the altar , lying down on the job of forging true partnerships , making up stories that they hoped would someday come true . They were swept out on the sea of love , carried away on a tide of sentimentality and emotion that would sooner or later return them to life 's rocky shore in a crushing wave of reality . They were bystanders at their own wedding , speaking vows they wrote themselves without ever acknowledging the truth about their relationship and their real lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least half of these marriages would not survive to the tenth anniversary . Many others would stick together , serving their time until death , locked in a prison of their own design , never comprehending how unions that began with such optimism and joy could go so horribly wrong . // How can it be that people who want only to be happy can end up so completely miserable ? What are the lies at the altar ? // NAMING THE LIE // A dear friend of mine recently ended a marriage after fourteen years and three children . The man Cheryl chose as her husband was wrong for her in every way . Harold had problems with addictions , he was unfaithful , he was manipulative and cruel . Now divorced , Cheryl was tormented that she could have made such a terrible choice . " What on earth was I thinking ? " she asked me . " How could I have married this man ? " // " You were just standing there lying at the altar , " I said . " Not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you were saying . " // She was shocked . " Lying " is a harsh word , and Cheryl insisted that she had really believed her wedding vows : " I meant it when I promised to be with him until death . " She added quietly , " And it almost killed me. " // What was Cheryl 's lie ? It was n't conscious or deliberate . It was the result of unconsciousness . Her lie began with the self-deception that Harold was not really who he appeared to be . Cheryl is one of the sweetest , most caring women I 've ever known . She always looks for the good in other people , which is a wonderful quality . But when you trust someone who has proved himself untrustworthy , you 're choosing a dangerous form of blindness . Harold telegraphed his true nature loud and clear before they were married , and Cheryl did n't see it . He was mean and controlling , and he showed little concern for Cheryl 's feelings . Even after they were engaged , he 'd disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and Cheryl had reason to suspect he was with other women . When she tried to ask him about it , he 'd accuse her of suffocating him . Once he said , " We 're not even married yet , and already you 're putting a noose around my neck . " Cheryl always backed down , feeling silly for saying anything , and this is when the self-doubt began to build a home in her mind , spirit , and heart . This is when she made the lie into the truth . The pattern would repeat itself throughout their marriage . Harold did whatever he wanted to do , and Cheryl learned not to challenge him because he always made her feel like a fool when she did . // Cheryl had been raised to believe that a woman had to work hard to be desirable to a man . Her father had made her feel unworthy , with frequent taunts that nobody would want to marry her if she stepped out of line . Harold continued the pattern , blaming Cheryl when he became withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd tell her to explain his absences . " You make me so mad , no wonder I need to drink . " // Cheryl took his words to heart and kept trying to do more and more to please him . Harold could not be pleased . " He constantly made critical little comments about how I kept house or took care of the children , " Cheryl said . " I just never felt as if I was good enough . " // Cheryl cried when she recalled a particularly overwhelming period shortly after she 'd given birth to their third child . " It was Sunday , and I always cooked a big dinner that day . After we ate , Harold went and plopped on the couch in front of the TV . It was getting late , I was exhausted , and there was so much to do . I had a new baby , a toddler , and a four-year-old running around . So I asked Harold if he could help me by bathing the older children . He did n't even look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I do n't feel like it . ' " // Cheryl remembered that day in particular because she so rarely asked Harold for help , and she 'd asked only out of desperation and exhaustion . His indifference cut her deeply . " I went straight into the bathroom and I cried like a baby , " she recalled . " Then I wiped my face and went downstairs and cleaned up the kitchen . After I finished , I gave the kids their baths and put them to bed . " // Cheryl felt real despair that day , but it took her fourteen years of the same treatment to finally leave Harold . Why so long ? Because she had made a sacred vow at the altar , and she refused to break that vow . She did n't understand that a promise made to someone who is n't even there , who can not reciprocate , is an empty promise . // Harold 's lie was more direct . He promised to love , honor , and cherish Cheryl , but only as long as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted . And here 's the real lie : Even when she complied , he gave her nothing in return . He never expressed appreciation . He never told her she was beautiful . He never hugged her or said he loved her . // It took enormous courage for Cheryl to admit the truth and file for divorce . Harold never did get it . " Do you think someone else is actually going to want you ? " he said derisively as she walked out the door . She did n't bother to answer . What was the point ? // TRUTH : THE SECRET INGREDIENT // Let 's agree that it 's time for the truth . From this day forward . // Even if you 've been hiding your real feelings for many years , burying your needs , harboring resentments , and deliberately denying what you know , you can make the choice to change . It does n't matter if you 've had a string of failed relationships , if you 're suffering in a marriage that is n't working , or if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can finally make a conscious effort to lay that heavy burden down . And here 's an amazing fact : Hard as it is to believe , you can find love in the course of facing the truth . It 's the secret ingredient to every great marriage . // Maybe you are planning your wedding as you read this , and have hopes of love everlasting . You want to know how to avoid the constant power struggles and unhappiness you 've seen in the marriages of your friends and family . If you ever hope to live happily , you 'll have to trust in the truth . You 'll have to believe that facing the truth is going to get you a lot closer to living a life full of joy than the lies . In fact , truth is the only way to create lasting love , security , and real passion . // Let me help you . The truth will set you free . // WAKE UP TO YOURSELF // A lot of the time it just feels easier to curl up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do wake up , it 's hard to go back to sleep . And the longer you stay in a state of wakefulness , the better and more natural it feels . // The first step is to begin looking at your relationship-the one you have now or one that failed in the past-and ask yourself some basic questions . This examination may expose painful realities , but try to avoid feelings of shame or blame . Shame ( " I 'm a bad person " ) provides a comfort zone for many people . It becomes an excuse to give up . Blame ( " He or she is a bad person " ) may feel temporarily satisfying , but it does n't get you closer to the truth . Shame and blame are relationship exits . They kill your dreams , your spirit , and your passion . I invite you to stay in the room and stay awake . // As you read the following Top Ten Lies and corresponding truths , learn to recognize the difference between the lie and the truth , and do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIE : If the package is beautifully wrapped , its contents will be fabulous . // TRUTH : The packaging does n't tell you anything about what 's inside . // " She 's not really my type , " my friend Gerald said of Irma , the woman he had been dating for five years . I was surprised to hear it . Gerald and Irma had always seemed very much in sync . They were both committed to community activism , enjoyed working on the old house they 'd bought together , loved children , and had similar senses of humor . Irma got along well with Gerald 's large family , and he was close to her parents . // " You and Irma seem great together , " I said . " Tell me what you mean when you say she 's not your type . " // Gerald shrugged . " I do n't know . I always thought I 'd be with someone different . I prefer petite women , because I 'm not so tall , and Irma is a couple inches taller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an artistic type , not an accountant like Irma. " // " Are you serious ? " I asked , thinking he was kidding . He was n't . When he broke up with Irma a few months later , she was stunned . So were their families and all of their friends . While Irma nursed her broken heart , Gerald began dating a dancer he met at a party . She was petite , artistic , and ten years younger than Irma . Within six months Gerald and the dancer were married . // It was no great shock when Gerald called me a year later , wanting to talk about his marriage . " It 's like living in a war zone , " he said bitterly . " She fights with me about everything . She hates the house , she refuses to spend time with my family , and all she ever wants to do is hang out with her stupid dancer friends . Now she tells me she does n't want children . " // I was sorry to see Gerald in so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy . He 'd chosen his ideal package , but when he opened it up , he did n't like the real woman inside . Sadly , she was n't his type at all . // Most people do n't intend to be shallow about choosing a mate . The facade is important , because it 's what you see in the first moment of attraction . It 's also terribly seductive . When a beautiful woman or a dashing man chooses you , that 's heady . When your partner is wealthy , accomplished , or famous , you feel elevated . These feelings are not wrong . The problem is , many people do n't dig any deeper than that . // A woman I know broke up with a man she 'd been seeing for several years . They had been engaged to be married , but it just had n't worked out . Their parting was amicable , and I asked if they would remain friends . She said , " No . He 's not someone I ever would have chosen as a friend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry someone who was n't even her friend . Their attraction was only skin-deep. // If you fall in love with his dreamy blue eyes or her silken auburn hair , there 's a rude awakening ahead . If you are not marrying the soul of your partner , there will be nothing to hold you together when the facade becomes less appealing . Trust me . It will . I think of the woman who sat in my office , crying her eyes out because her husband of six years had told her he was physically repulsed by her . She 'd been slender when they married , but had gained about twenty pounds during two pregnancies . He took it as a personal affront , saying , " You knew when we got married that being overweight was a deal breaker . " // Life brings hardships , sickness , aging , and stresses that are beyond our ability to predict . Bodies sag and hair thins . People want to put their best face forward when they 're courting , but you need to be able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask yourself : Do you like what you see on the inside as much as what you see on the outside ? // 2 . LIE : The past is over . // TRUTH : The past is driving you to the chapel . // " My real life starts on my wedding day , " Stacey told me firmly , explaining why she was n't going to tell her fianc ? , Frank , about the child she 'd borne out of wedlock and given up for adoption when she was sixteen . She wanted to permanently shut the door on her old mistakes and start life fresh with the man she loved . // " The question is , why are you not telling him ? " I asked . " Do you worry that he 'll think less of you ? Will he consider it shameful , when in actuality it is sacred and meaningful ? What does that say about him ? About you ? Why would you be willing to go underground with your own sacred story ? " // Stacey had hoped that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " without the baggage of her past . Life does n't work that way . When we say , " My life starts here , " we deny the reality that the past is the limousine driving us to the chapel . // After our conversation , Stacey decided to tell Frank about the baby . It was a big risk , because although she trusted him , she felt her secret was so big it could cancel everything out . Later , she called me to tell me what had happened . Her voice was shaking . // " He hugged me , " she exclaimed , and she started crying . " He said , ' That must have been so hard for you . ' " She could n't believe Frank 's response-his capacity for empathy . In an instant , it changed her life and lifted her shame . Stacey had been unaware that her shame was not something he evoked , but what she had carried with her as a result of her own family 's response to her teenage pregnancy and adoption . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to see me on the verge of separation . Amy said she did n't trust her husband , John . When I tried to get to the bottom of what had triggered her lack of trust , it was revealed that John had told a big lie at the beginning of their relationship . Although he had been married and divorced twice , he 'd told Amy he 'd been married only once . He was afraid she would n't be interested in him if she knew the truth . Unfortunately , Amy found out about his second marriage at the worst possible time-when they applied for a marriage license . She was shocked but did n't put on the brakes . She did n't say , " Wait a minute . Who are you , really ? Let 's delay the wedding for a few months while I find out . " // She convinced herself that his lie did n't matter . The wedding proceeded as planned . But from the first day of their marriage , she could n't trust John . He , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to lie , " he said , " but ... I do n't know . " John looked at me helplessly . // " You 're afraid if she knows the real you , she wo n't want you , " I said . //
