PLUMAGE FROM PEGASUS <p> ONE SUNDAY , while reading the Washington Post Book World , I realized that for months now one particular byline had been missing from its pages : that of famous critic Cleverly Taint . <p> Upon realizing this , I began to cast backward through my recent memories of reading other literary journals . In no case could I recall newish reviews or essays by Taint . The New York Review of Books ; the Times Literary Supplement ; New Republic ; the Nation ; the New York Times Book Review ; Atlantic ; Harpers - All of Taint 's usual venues had been barren of his idiosyncratic prose . No tapering off , no explanation : just a sudden drought . <p> This made me sad . I liked Taint 's writing . He was acerbic and witty , erudite and perceptive . And he had been kind to me . A review he had authored of one of my early books had been instrumental in landing me my first agent . Although we had never met , I felt a link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Post and made a resolve . I would track down Taint and learn the cause of his silence . Perhaps he was sick or broke or otherwise down on his luck . There might be some way I could help him . <p> So the very next day I began phoning and e-mailing people in the business . Within a few hours , I had Taint 's contact information . I dashed off a brief message online , explaining that I was a fan of his work , had noted the disappearance of his writing , and would be happy to meet with him to talk about the subject , on a strictly personal and confidential level . <p> The very next hour brought an electronic reply : Good to hear from you . Let 's have a drink . But nothing can possibly help my career now . <p> A fellow New Yorker , Taint nominated a bar that proved to be midway between our apartments , and a time just hours away . Needless to say I was there well in advance , even more intrigued than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his message . <p> A dim vinyl booth in back held the critic , familiar to me from his many appearances on various PBS and cable-channel literary chat shows . Of course , off the screen and in his current condition , Taint looked more disreputable and slovenly than the usually dapper homme de lettres known to the viewing public . And , having beat me here , he had already started drinking . <p> I slipped into the booth , we shook hands , and I ordered a beer . After some inconsequential chitchat about mutual friends , enemies and acquaintances , I broached the crucial topic . <p> " Why the vast silence , Cleverly ? Is it possible you 've abandoned literature ? Has your passion for explicating fiction guttered out ? " <p> The red eyes of the litterateur grew misty . " Not at all . I still love the damn stuff . " <p> " It must be censorship then . You 've been blacklisted . But what could you have possibly done to get on the bad side of so many editors simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waitress for another . <p> " Are you kidding ? I have editors calling me daily , begging me for anything - a blurb , a capsule review , even a ' books received ' notice . But I dare not submit anything . Nor dare I explain why . And of course , that blanket refusal is indeed finally beginning to piss them off . Soon I will be blacklisted . " <p> " I do n't understand then . Those are the only possible explanations - No , wait , is it writer 's block ? " <p> Taint laughed and held up his hands . " Could these fluent fingers ever fail to dance across the keyboard ? No , I 'm not blocked . I am positively overflowing with opinions and apercus , harsh flensings and bountiful encomiums . But I can not commit any of them to print , for fear of the repercussions . " <p> " Oh , come now , I do n't buy that . You 've always called them as you 've seen them , never fearful or beholden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your profession . Who could possibly harm you ? Except yourself , of course , which is what I see you doing now . " <p> " How about a witch ? " <p> I was flabbergasted . " A witch ? " <p> " Yes . One of those New Age Wiccans . Perhaps you recall my review some months ago of a certain ' novel ' - if one can dishonor the beloved term - by one Luna Samhain . Nothing Says Lovin ' Like Something from the Coven . " <p> " That stinker ? You positively eviscerated it . And with what damning effect ! One week it was on all the bestseller lists , and the next week it was on remainder tables across the nation . " <p> Taint smiled wanly . " My final triumph . Would that I had never heard of that woman and her book ! " <p> " Are you telling me she - she cursed you ? " <p> " Yes . I received her malevolent letter shortly after the review ran . It arrived by messenger bat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Every word of her curse was subsequently proven true . And what a curse ! Simple blindness or paralysis would have been merciful . I could still dictate my reviews from inside an iron lung , like that Frenchman and his autobiography . " <p> By now I was nearly dying with curiosity . " Tell me - what did she do to you ? " <p> " Only this . Every book I inveigh against will succeed , and every book I praise will fail . Without exception . " <p> I let out an involuntary gust of breath , as if I had been punched . " But , but - that 's fiendish ! " <p> Taint nodded sadly . " Is n't it though ? I learned the full impact of it with the very next review of mine that followed the bestowal of the curse . Does the title Titanium Skirts mean anything to you ? " <p> " Of course . The debut book of short stories by Esther Pribyl . Everyone predicted great things for it . After all , Pribyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being both a NASCAR driver and a top fashion model . But the book stiffed . " <p> " Right after my extolling of it . " <p> " But surely that 's mere coincidence . " <p> " Is it ? Then how do you explain the success of , gack , Howling Blood , as soon as I sought to bury it ? " <p> " That horror novel by the ten  --  year-old ex-fundamentalist preacher kid ? Well , you know the tastes of the public .... " <p> " Oh , do n't try to convince me everything is just random synchronicity . I went through all these chains of reasoning myself at first , reluctant to believe in anything so foolish as a curse . But the misfirings continued to pile up . Then I began to experiment . I 'd wait until the critical consensus was in on a book , and it was well on its way either up or down the charts . Then I 'd weigh in . And the book would inevitably reverse its direction ! There was no mistaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression and grim certainty forced me to accept his conclusions . " But this is awful ! If you render your true opinion , you bestow upon a book the exact opposite fate it deserves ! " <p> " Correct . And what if I try to get around the curse by lavishing kisses on the stinkers and hurling brickbats at the exemplary books ? Sure , the individual authors will benefit or suffer appropriately . But what about my reputation ? I 'll be seen as an idiot ! All the virtue and respect I 've accumulated will be as nought ! My peers will call me a hack , a tout , a vulgarian , a Philistine ! My name will rank with Rex Reed 's and Walter Kim 's as a laughingstock ! " <p> I thought furiously for fifteen minutes , but came up with no solution other than : " Could n't you apologize to Samhain ? Promise to praise all her books from here on , if she removes the curse ? " <p> Taint erupted . " Never ! That would leave me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good name allied on the side of crap . No , a brooding silence is my only recourse . " <p> I pushed away from the table and slid out of the booth . " Well , Cleverly , I 'm very sorry . If I have any more helpful ideas , I 'll be sure to get in touch with you again . " <p> I left him drowning his sorrows in liquor , fully expecting never to hear from the poor doomed bastard again . <p> Great was my surprise when Taint called me only three weeks later . His voice was filled with glee . <p> " I thought you 'd like to know I 've gotten a new job ! I 'm out of books now , and into television . " <p> I confessed to bafflement . " Doing what ? " <p> " I 'm a producer with one of the networks . I called in a few chits  --  you remember when I gave a smashing review to that novel by the soapopera actor , calling it a ' postmodern shattering of the intermedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in charge of developing new shows . I 'll be making scads more money than I ever could as a lowly critic . " <p> " I assume the curse has been lifted then . " <p> " Not at all ! " <p> " But wo n't your endorsement as producer continue to damn the shows you admire and boost the ones you hate ? " <p> " Exactly ! But that 's just what I need to happen . You see , every time I manage to get a literate , witty , experimental show on the air , just the kind I admire , it will earn immense praise from the critics but garner only low ratings typical of its kind and eventually fail . However , my star will shine brightly in the press as a daring executive willing to take risks for quality programming . ' Here 's one pitch I 've already made . The High Art Tradition with Jonathan Franzen . ' One hundred percent talking heads on a set that looks like every tenured English professor 's living room . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , any commercial dreck I promote yet detest will of course soar in the ratings , earning my network millions , and making me the golden boy . I 've got one such project greenlighted already . It stars Meryl Streep as a transgendered single parent , and it 's called Ex-Why  --  Question Mark . " ' <p> " Did she go from female to male or vice versa ? " <p> " That 's the beauty part ! You never know ! Sometimes she dresses butch , sometimes she 's all Ru Paul . Her sex life is totally open-ended . Lots of hunky and babelicious guest stars , including Ellen Degeneres . The watercooler buzz will be enormous ! " <p> I failed to repress a groan . <p> " No , do n't look at it by your outmoded standards . This is a winwin situation ! " <p> I tried objectively to see a flaw in Taint 's reasoning , but failed . <p> " You do n't suppose that other television producers share your curse , do you ? " <p> " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their secret society ! Would you like to join our screenwriters ' auxiliary ? We have staff witches who can make the necessary adjustments in your talents . " <p> I thought about tossing off lefthandedly potboilers that hit the bestseller lists , and slaving over brilliant masterpieces that met endless rejection . <p> " No thanks , it 's too much like what I 'm already used to . " <p>
