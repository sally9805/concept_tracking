It 's bring your dead wife to work Day on planet Solaris . When reports of disquiet seep from a manned space mission , Chris Kelvin ( George Clooney ) is sent to find out what went wrong . Beautifully wrong , for all the passengers have been infected with a palpable vision of someone they have loved and lost . Waking to find a perfect facsimile of his late wife ( Natascha McElhone ) , Kelvin soon surrenders to what seems like a gift from the grave . Steven Soderbergh 's remake of Andrei Tarkovsky 's science-fiction classic , based on the Stanislaw Lem novel , ca n't touch the 1972 film 's austere poignancy , and McElhone lacks the bewitching beauty of Natalya Bondarchuk in the original Solaris . But the project 's gravity and ambition ca n't be denied . They inform Clooney 's gently grieving demeanor , the ache in his eyes , the hope against hope for a love after death .  --  By Richard Corliss <P> Yuck , preppies . Beloved William Hundert ( Kevin Kline ) teaches classics at snooty St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a brat named Sedgewick Bell ( Emile Hirsch ) , a cheeky cheat in whom he somewhat mysteriously detects good stuff . The conventions of the genre usually dictate that the boy will ultimately reform . The considerable originality of The Emperor 's Club ( directed by Michael Hoffman ) lies in the fact that the kid gets worse , not better , going on to sleazy dotcom millions and , of course , politics . This leaves the prissily played Hundert sadder and wiser . But it still may leave viewers emotionally disconnected from this distinctly unchipper Mr. Chips .  --  By Richard Schickel <P> Disney 's new animated feature , Treasure Planet , is rated PG not so much to scare away little kids ( nothing gamy here ) as to alert teenage boys that there 's enough gaudy action in the classic cartoon format to keep them happy . This space-traveler version of Treasure Island  --  replete with flying galleons and intergalactic pirates  --  splashes lavish special effects on a colorful palette without forfeiting attention to character detail . Example : the movie 's protean robot as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartoon sideman since Robin Williams ' Genie in Aladdin . Directors Ron Clements and John Musker ( The Little Mermaid , Aladdin , Hercules ) take a while to get their vehicle to sail and soar . But when it does , this Planet is a treasure .  --  R.C.
