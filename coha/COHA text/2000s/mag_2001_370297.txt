Should you be taking drugs to lower your cholesterol ? For millions of Americans who never dreamed they had a heart condition , the answer to that question changed abruptly last week . Impressed by mounting evidence that aggressive treatment can significantly reduce death from heart disease , a panel of experts from the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute issued new guidelines for treating high cholesterol . In one stroke , the panel nearly tripled  --  from 13 million to 36 million  --  the number of adults who should be taking daily doses of powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs . They also raised by 25%  --  from 52 million to 65 million  --  the number who should go on a cholesterol-lowering diet . <P> Think of it as a remake of a Hollywood movie starring a cast of familiar characters : the good cholesterol ( HDL ) , the bad ( LDL ) and the ugly ( heart disease ) . The heroes are diet , exercise and a class of drugs called statins that cut cholesterol levels sharply by blocking a liver enzyme involved in cholesterol production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get tested , early and often . Beginning at age 20 and every five years thereafter , all adults  --  even if they do n't show signs of disease  --  should have their blood screened to get a lipoprotein profile ( HDL , LDL , total cholesterol and triglycerides ) . <P> The last time guidelines were issued was eight years ago ; since then we 've learned a great deal about the role of HDL , the " good " cholesterol . A level of 60 or more is still considered to be protective against heart disease , but now we know low levels can also be dangerous . Before , doctors believed we should have a minimum level of 35 . Now the bar has been raised to 40 . <P> LDL has always played the heavy , the bad guy behind the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries . The revised recommendations draw new lines in the sand . The optimal level is 100 . Levels above 190 are off the charts . But even borderline ( 101 to 129 ) , high-borderline ( 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) can benefit from treatment . <P> Triglycerides , free-floating molecules that circulate in our blood transporting fats for storage and metabolism , were given short shrift eight years ago . But recent studies show that elevated triglyceride levels significantly increase risk of heart disease . It 's now recommended that even borderline-high triglyceride levels ( 150 to 199 ) be treated through weight control and physical activity and , in extreme cases , with drugs . <P> How do you find out where you stand ? Once you have your test results , calculating your level of risk is fairly straightforward . The National Institutes of Health has devised a formula that weighs the factors and tells you how likely you are to have a heart attack in the next 10 years . Easy-to-use computerized versions of this formula can be found at various websites , including
