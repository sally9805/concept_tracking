Q Our nephew 's not allowed to watch TV at home . Do we have to enforce the rule when he 's over ? Rules are different from house to house , and kids know it . Most parents know this , too  --  after all , it would be presumptuous to tell other moms how to run their homes or what rules to follow ( unless we 're talking safety violations or , say , feeding hamburgers to little vegetarians ) . But that 's not to say you should plan a morning-TV marathon during the visit . My girls ' friend Sydney is n't allowed to watch much TV at her house ( I know this because it 's come up in conversation , not because her mom demanded she not watch when she 's at our place ) , so when Sydney comes over , I 'm less likely to agree automatically to requests for SpongeBob and more likely to point out fun things they could play instead of sacking out in front of the box . So when your nephew is over , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but consider all the wonderful stuff they can do together . At the same time , do n't hide the fact that your kids watch . Tell his mom up front : " I know you do n't really like Mikey watching TV , and I 've got a bunch of activities planned . But there may be a time when they take a break and enjoy a quick show  --  I hope you do n't mind . " If she does , she wo n't send him over . But something tells me she 'll be okay with it . " This much I know ... When Nick and I married ten years ago , his mom gave me a precious piece of advice : " Remember , " she said , " love changes . " I did n't get it at the time , but now , after two babies , a move , a new career , and a decade of life , I do . How our love has changed : 1 . Nick used to love my hot figure . Now , he loves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and says it often . 2 . He loved cuddling his baby girls . Now , he teaches them to throw like boys and have the confidence of men . 3 . He loved me enough to put a ring on my finger and walk me down the aisle . Now he says he loves me enough to do it all over again . I do , too . Second-baby showers ? Q My sister-in-law wants to throw me a shower for my family 's newest addition , but friends say you should only get one for your firstborn . What 's the rule ? My mom said the same thing : Everyone bought what I needed for my first baby , and it was unfair to pressure them to buy stuff for my second . Honestly , I kind of agreed with her . But my BFF Angelou was n't having it ; babies , she insisted , deserve to be celebrated  --  whether they 're your first , your third , or your tenth . She ended up hosting a low-key get-together , and guests were told not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be something just for me , as my baby already had all she could need . Your friend can do the same for you . But if it still feels greedy , make it a party with a purpose  --  suggest guests give an optional donation to a local charity . That way , people will know the true intent of your shower : to welcome your child into the circle of people who love you . We had a fight  --  can our kids stay pals ? Q A mom and I used to be close , but we recently had a falling-out . Our 3-year-olds still like each other  --  is there any way I can keep them friends ? There are a few ways to look at this . The cold truth is that while your kids may get along swimmingly , they 're too young to get all broken up if they stop seeing each other . At that age , they 're likely to move on pretty quickly . But if the friendship is especially nice for your child and you 're not interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-amiga , then grit your teeth and take one for your baby . Plan the kids ' get-togethers at a neutral spot , like a playground or local pool , where grown-up conversations take a backseat to the kiddie activities you have to monitor . If you 're lucky , you 'll meet another mom and make a new friend . And a new pal  --  for your child and you  --  might not be a bad thing anyway .
