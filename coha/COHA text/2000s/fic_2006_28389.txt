The Greener Shore By Morgan Llywelyn Random House Morgan Llywelyn Chapter I The sun is the symbol of the great fire of life , created by the Source of All Being . I remind myself of this whenever the glare of the sun makes me squint . I , Ainvar , salute the Source of All Being . The Source of All Troubles is Caesar the Reprehensible . I should have recognized that from the beginning . I keep going over and over events as if by tumbling them in my hands like pebbles I can change their shape . I can not . Even a chief druid can not redraw the Pattern . But I can see it . Oh yes . Looking back , I can see it so clearly . At some crucial point the tribes of Gaul must have disrupted the harmony of the Pattern , thus precipitating catastrophe . Which means that at some crucial point the druids failed . I failed . At first the Gauls had welcomed traders from the tribes of Latium as they had welcomed the Hellenes before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , being hard and abrupt rather than musical , but we shared the vocabulary of trade : a nod , a grunt , a slap of hands . In this manner arrangements were concluded and goods exchanged . Gaul offered salt and iron and grain ; the speakers of Latin brought wine and olive oil and luxury goods from the Mid-Earth Sea . Traders from each side were able to provide enough to satisfy the other side . Everyone benefited.For a while . Then one tribe , the Romans , proved they did not understand the concept of Enough ; they wanted More . Their traders brought warriors to stand at their shoulders while they made unreasonable demands . The Gauls swatted the more importunate traders away as one swats a fly . The Romans kept coming . Tendrils of a poisonous weed , they extended their reach until at last we realized their true and deadly intent . Led by someone called Gaius Julius Caesar -- a figure of walking excrement that needs three names to make it feel like a man -- the Romans meant to steal everything from us , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . If I close my eyes I can still see the glorious victories we won ; the desperate battles we lost . And then the final battle . And the subsequent destruction of all we held dear . The destruction of the Great Grove of the Carnutes blew us away like chaff on the wind . I chew on my memories as if they were food , but receive no nourishment from them . When I dream , I dream of the lost skies of Gaul . Free Gaul , which bled to death to fatten Caesar 's purse . my wives refuse to talk about the past . following briga 's lead , the other two keep their faces turned to the west and their eyes on the future . Onuava is a tall , strong woman , with a lion 's mane of fair hair . Her first husband was Vercingetorix , chief of the Arverni . His name meant " King of the World . " Such a man is not born once in ten generations . The tribes of Gaul made him their leader when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they needed him even more . Onuava was carrying his first son in her womb when they dragged Vercingetorix away . After Keryth the prognosticator foresaw the death of Vercingetorix at the hands of his captors , I made Onuava my third wife . Although we were as different as fire and water , Rix and I were , are , and always shall be , soul friends . I was obligated to offer my fullest protection to his family . Since then I have even learned to love Onuava , at least as much as her proud and prickly nature will allow . My second wife is Onuava 's opposite . Lakutu is small and dark , docile by nature and Egyptian by birth . She was already past her prime when I first saw her . Lakutu is old now , yet from time to time a mischievous child peeks out of her black eyes . There are intriguing rumors concerning certain mysterious rites practiced in her homeland . Although Lakutu has learned our language , she conveniently forgets it whenever I question her about those rites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head my second wife holds knowledge to which I can not gain access , and that is her power over me . Druids love a mystery . Briga is the youngest of my three wives in age , but senior to them in rank . The daughter of a prince of the Sequani tribe , she was the first woman with whom I celebrated the marriage ritual . According to our custom Briga had to give permission for me to marry Lakutu , and then she and Lakutu had to give permission for me to marry Onuava . Such permissions usually are granted , because each additional wife serves the wife who is senior to her . In practice , Onuava serves no one , but that was to be expected . My Briga is a small , sturdy person with hair like dark flax . Her most interesting feature is her voice , as soft and hoarse as the purring of a cat . Her speech still bears the musical lilt of her native tribe . The Sequani are Gaulish Celts like ourselves but they speak a different dialect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never left the Blue Mountains . I love the sound of it on Briga 's lips ; the exotic echo of an older time . Many women are more beautiful , yet from the beginning Briga drew me like no other . I did not know the body but I recognized the spirit within . It spoke to me through her blue eyes , as clear as those of a child . Her spirit was a member of the tender network that surrounds me through all my lives . Each of us has such a network , stretching from the distant past into the far future , making us Part of the Whole . Briga knows me better than I know myself . And loves me anyway . The first time I lay with her I knew what the Source of All Being experienced at the moment of creation . Because Celtic law allows a man of high rank to have more than one wife , the Romans called us savages . Yet who is the savage ? A chieftain -- or a druid -- can offer the status and protection of marriage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled in the land of the Romans and seen how they live . The depraved men of Rome have only one wife at a time , but use any number of concubines and prostitutes . These poor creatures must suffer whatever indignities are heaped upon them . When their sexual attraction fades , they are discarded . By purchasing Lakutu I had saved her from such a fate . When Vercingetorix and I came upon her , quite by accident , in a Roman slave market , she was already well-used goods . After another year or two the Romans would have had her cleaning out latrines . They would have thrown away a truly exceptional spirit . All my women are exceptional . While she was married to Vercingetorix , Onuava and I had worked powerful sex magic together . To assure her husband 's election as commander-in-chief of the united armies of Gaul she had opened her body to mine . The power of the ancient ritual pleaded for Rix in the Otherworld and enabled him to fulfill his Pattern . No other man in Gaul could have formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senones , Sequani , Parisii , and Carnutes into a confederacy to defeat Caesar . And he almost succeeded . That knowledge torments my dreams and miseries my days . With the splendid and shining Vercingetorix leading the united tribes of Free Gaul , we defied the despicable Caesar and his army of clanking dwarfs and very nearly won . Clanking dwarfs . A perfect description that illustrates one of the differences between Celts and Romans . Our warriors were taller than the invaders by the length of a man 's forearm . In battle they did not hinder their bodies with armor or imprison their heads in iron . Free and unencumbered , the warriors of Gaul faced whatever the day brought . They were celebrated for their courage , which resulted from the teaching of their druids . No person who understands that an immortal spirit inhabits the mortal body need fear death . In my youth Menua , our chief druid , who had been trained in the greatest of all druid schools , told me , " Dying means only a change of direction in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing but the least thing , a cobweb we brush through . " Death brings us back to the dawn of life so we may start afresh without the burden of memory . Examples of this may be observed in nature , where nothing is wasted . Living spirits , sparks of the Great Fire of Life , move from one existence to another as butterflies burst from the husks of dead caterpillars . The butterfly does not remember its life crawling on the ground . It knows only the freedom of the air . The warped Romans do not study nature ; only the works of men . This leads them to make the incredible assumption that when a human body ceases to breathe , life ceases to exist . What arrogance ! Vercingetorix and I sometimes spoke of these things , when the rest of the camp was asleep and we were lying on our backs staring up into the sky . Rix loved the night sky more than anyone I ever knew . Together we wandered the pathless stars and explored the womb of worlds . Rix contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy -- the word the Greeks use to describe the speculations of druids . But he also possessed a degree of curiosity not often found in fighting men . Warriors need to follow orders without asking questions . Thinking is for druids . Thinking , and curiosity . As a small child I had asked my grandmother , who was the wisest person I knew , " Why do we fall down and not up ? " " No one knows , " she replied . " It 's magic . " That was the first time I heard of magic . When Rix asked questions I did my best to answer them , and prayed to That Which Watches that I might always give him good advice . For the most part , I did . Except , except . . . Briga says I dwell too much on the past . Perhaps she is right , though I shall never tell her so . A man who has three wives learns what not to admit . On the day we stepped off the edge of the world and into this boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not heard it for so long . Not since Alesia . Shortly after that disastrous defeat we had heard rumors that Caesar , not content with waging war for Gaul , also had sent his troops to the land of the Britons , wherever that was . I trembled for them . While the wheel of the seasons turned and winters followed one another in grim succession , my small band of survivors fled into the trackless forest . During what the vile Caesar called " the pacification of Hairy Gaul , " the Romans spent summer after summer scarring our homeland with roads and military fortifications . They did not find us , however . We had buried ourselves so deep in the wilderness we never heard a word of Latin . For us , everything beyond the forest ceased to exist . We knew nothing of Rome and Romans , but lived an inward life whose boundaries were the trees . Still , we did not feel safe . We were as quiet as birds pressing themselves against the earth as the hawk flies over . We never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was raping Gaul . When the land was sufficiently " cleansed " of rebellious natives , settlers began to arrive . They started cutting down the great forest that sheltered us . Then Keryth dreamed a dream in which she spoke with the handful of other druids who still survived . They were able to confirm her prophecy : Vercingetorix had been murdered in Rome . They told her every grisly detail which she then related , with great pain , to me . Druids know the truth when they hear it . As far as I was concerned it signaled the end of the world . Yet now my Briga could laugh . She spread her arms wide as if she would embrace the sea , and laughed aloud with joy . " We will begin a new life , Ainvar ! " My Briga crinkles her nose when she laughs . The Celtic figure of the Two-Faced One possesses one set of features looking in one direction and another set looking the opposite way . It is open to many interpretations : life and death , summer and winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , women look toward life . How wise was the Source to create such balance . It is a pity the Source did not create boats . Boats are not natural , but man-made , so I have misgivings . It is difficult for me to accept that a vessel filled with people can float on top of the water . A stone weighing much less than a boat would sink immediately . Sometimes my head ponders on this . We obtained these boats in the land of Armorica , from a trader who belonged to the tribe of the Veneti . They inhabit the westernmost shores and claim to know what lies beyond the sunset . I hope they do . Our future may depend on it .
