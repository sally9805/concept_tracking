John Street came into office in 2000 with an ambitious agenda to improve Philadelphia 's worst neighborhoods , and even his critics agree he has made considerable progress . But , says Otis White , of the public-policy consulting firm Civic Strategies , " whatever his grand visions have been , he will not be remembered for them . He will be remembered for the corruption around him . " <P> There has been no evidence that Street , 61 , himself is corrupt , but federal prosecutors say the mayor 's close friend and fund raiser , Ron White , partially took control of city contracting and turned the process into a naked shakedown for donations to Street 's 2003 re-election campaign . White died before going to trial , but former city treasurer Cory Kemp , a member of Street 's administration , and four other defendants await a jury 's verdict . The scandals have turned Street into a lame duck a year early . " The city is in a kind of suspended animation as long as the trials go on , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scully/Philadelphia .
