The U.S. has insisted it ca n't comply with demands from Iraq 's top Shi'ite cleric , Grand Ayatullah Ali al-Sistani , that the first post-Saddam government be established via nationwide direct elections . U.S. officials say that would be too difficult to pull off before the June 30 deadline for the transfer of power . Instead , the U.S. wants the new government to be chosen by local caucuses . Ahead of meetings in New York City this week with U.N . Secretary-General Kofi Annan , Paul Bremer , the U.S. civilian chief in Iraq , said , " We have doubts , as does the Secretary-General , that elections can in fact be called in the time frame of sovereignty to the Iraqi people on June 30 .

That not only would stoke the flames of a potential Sunni rebellion but also could prompt Sunni states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to refuse to recognize the new Iraq and pave the way for an anti-American alliance with Iran . <P> An aide to al-Sistani last week said he might issue a fatwa telling his followers not to recognize any government that has not been directly elected . Publicly , the U.S. is sticking to its guns , saying some compromise on the election issue is still possible . But privately , U.S. officials predict Washington will blink first . With time running out to get a handover started in Baghdad , a State Department source says , " they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  By Massimo Calabresi and Hassan Fatah
