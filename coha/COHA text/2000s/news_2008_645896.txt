During the campaign , the Obama team showed how new media tools can be used to win the White House . Now , the president-elect 's advisers and allies are previewing how they intend to use the power of online organizing to govern . <p> The effort gained national visibility when President-elect Barack Obama started posting YouTube videos of his weekly national address , and it accelerated as the transition team and others solicited supporters ideas on what to do next with their " movement . " <p> Analysts say Obama is n't just trying to make government more transparent by posting online videos of himself or his transition team 's doings . He is attempting to organize his campaign supporters into a political force that he can tap in tough times - like when he needs to go around Congress and the mainstream media for direct citizen support . <p> " Just like people had n't used the Internet in campaigning to this extent before , they have n't really used it to govern before , " said Peter Daou , Internet strategist for Sen. Hillary Rodham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how to use something that was used mostly for campaign advocacy - and use it in a way to advance policy . " <p> That 's tricky . A campaign runs on an adrenaline rush fueled by a deadline election day , a person to rally against and the rush of daily polls . Shepherding policy through Washington is not as sexy , and now the candidate is president of all Americans - not just his supporters . <p> So on the grassroots level , the legions of Obama supporters who self-organized on social networking sites are reconvening to figure out what to do . Meanwhile , the incoming administration is trying to figure out how to engage its supporters and solicit their ideas - and continued support . <p> " Where they meet in the middle somewhere is where the energy will come from , " Daou said . <p> Those efforts intensified last week when Obama campaign manager David Plouffe asked the estimated 11 million members of Obama ' s e-mail list what new ideas they had for the administration . Before asking supporters to complete a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this movement . Now it 's up to you to decide how we move forward . " <p> The survey asked supporters " how they would like to be engaged " and to rank the importance of " goals for this movement " such as " Helping Barack 's administration pass legislation through grassroots efforts " and " training volunteers in the organizing techniques we used to elect Barack . " <p> The efforts extend beyond the official Obama organization . <p> On Thursday night , MoveOn.org - whose members supported Obama - held more than 1,200 offline " Fired Up and Ready to Go " parties . The point of the gatherings , according to an invitation from MoveOn : " We 'll launch a new campaign to help Barack win big changes - like health care and clean energy . " The group will follow Thursday 's meetings with a day of personal lobbying on Capitol Hill and in congressional district offices Jan. 21 , the day after Obama is sworn in . <p> The 5 million-member liberal online hub has seen its membership transformed this year . MoveOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 55 percent of them are not white . Membership was 85 percent white before . At least half of the newcomers are under 35 , said executive director Eli Pariser . <p> Unlike past political campaigns , where voters returned home after casting their ballots and waited for politicians to deliver results , many Obama supporters are looking for ways to continue to provide their input and offer help . <p> " It 's clear to MoveOn members that they want to continue to focus on a few core issues , " Pariser said . <p> In addition to posting the president-elect 's weekly addresses on YouTube , the Obama transition team is posting snippets that describe the activities of some of its transition groups . A three-minute video titled " Inside the Transition : Energy and Environment Policy Team " that recently appeared may not sound like scintillating viewing , but it does give viewers a peek into the mind-set of the incoming government . <p> " He does n't have to wait for CBS to use four seconds of one of his speeches as a sound bite in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his supporters - and everyone else , " Pariser said . <p> But Obama ' s early efforts on YouTube have not been in the two-way spirit of new media communication - comments are not accepted , although people can repost the videos or embed them elsewhere and start their own conversation threads . <p> " I 'm not sure of the strategy behind that , " said Steve Grove , YouTube 's head of news and politics . " They 're probably trying to feel out how it will work . " <p> If the Obama administration is anything like the Obama campaign , Grove predicts it will produce a prolific amount of video . He would n't be surprised if Cabinet officials and other top administration leaders began posting videos , too . And , even though " day-in-the-life " videos may be hackneyed , Grove said there would be an audience for such a behind-the-scenes peek at the White House . <p> Obama ' s YouTube channel had more than 1,800 videos during the campaign , and they were viewed 110 million times . Many posted after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a dozen were seen at least 1 million times . <p> " Their user base has come to expect a certain level of accessibility , " Grove said . " But the challenge will be to find that sweet spot now that they 're governing . There has to be a certain imprimatur and gravitas when the president of the United States is involved . " <p> There 's no shortage of other ideas on how to engage people online . During the campaign , Obama officials talked about ways to create a " Craigslist for service " - where people interested in doing some sort of public service or volunteering could be connected with a need in their community . Others have spoken about video streaming all open government meetings . Daou said to expect a lot of " trial and error over the next few months as the White House sees what works . " <p> " What 's most important is that he makes government more transparent , " said Raven Brooks , executive director of Netroots Nation , the annual conference of bloggers and online activists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Brooks idea : He would love to see Obama - or more likely an aide - use the social networking tool Twitter to update citizens on what he is up to throughout the day . " He would n't have to be giving away state secrets or anything , but maybe something like , ' I just met with Paul Volcker and we talked about monetary policy . <p> " Now , the average voter is not a political junkie , and may not be interested in that level of minutiae , but I think a lot of people would appreciate the effort to communicate , " Brooks said . <p> A spokesman for the Obama transition team said of its new media strategy , " Unfortunately , we 're not ready to discuss further details at this time . " <p> Perhaps the details will be posted first on YouTube . <p> " There has to be a certain imprimatur and gravitas when the president of the United States is involved .
