Eating raw fish , avoiding hungry sharks and using skills learned in Scouting . Steven Callahan survives 76 harrowing days adrift in the Atlantic . // // " Get out , get out , the boat 's going down ! " Steven Callahan thinks as he jumps to action in the darkness of the night . Aboard the small sailboat he designed and built , Callahan has just been awakened by a large bang . His boat had been rammed by what he now , years later , believes was a whale . Within seconds , the water in the boat is waist deep and Napoleon Solo is sinking . Eight days out on the Atlantic , Callahan is alone at sea , hundreds of miles from the nearest land . There 's only one person who can possibly save Steven Callahan . Himself . He scrambles , first inflating a five-and-a-half-foot raft . Then he grabs whatever he can : a small bag of food with peanuts , baked beans , corned beef , soaked raisins , eight pints of fresh water , a space blanket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three solar stills for distilling salt water into fresh water and the raft air pump . By the third day , bathed by frigid wave after wave , Callahan is shivering and shore . His wet sleeping bag and space blanket are meager protection against the constant barrage of cold seawater . Hundreds of boils have broken out on his skin , and the saltwater burns each new raw cut . Thus , the voyage began for Callahan atop the raft he would jokingly refer to as Rubber Ducky . Starting on Jan. 29 , 1982 , Callahan would spend a mind-boggling 76 days aboard a vessel the size of an outhouse . He would fend off scorching midday sun , cold ocean temperatures , starvation , dehydration , shark attacks and the disappointment of watching nine ships pass without their occupants having the slightest idea he was there . Deserted at sea , Callahan was finally spotted off the coast of the Caribbean island Guadeloupe by a group of fishermen . His true tale of survival atop the Atlantic would become a best-selling book , " Adrift . " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man fought to survive against insurmountable odds . You Just Never Know " Be Prepared " is the Scout motto we all live by . Sometimes , though , we may take it for granted . Not Steven Callahan . " Things are going well , but you never know what can happen next , " he says . " You might fall down and break your leg . Or your boat can sink in the middle of the ocean . You have to pay attention and be ready for anything . " Growing up in Dover , Mass. , Callahan got his first taste of the wilderness on Scouting trips to Vermont and New Hampshire . He learned to canoe down rivers and backpack up the peaks of the White Mountains . When Callahan was 11 , his Scoutmaster , Arthur Adams , invited him to serve as crew day-sailing on the nearby Atlantic Ocean . Callahan accepted , and was immediately hooked on the oceanic life . " Sailing involves so much , " Callahan says . " From gauging the wind to studying the charts and the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . I was always curious about life , and this tied it all together . " Adams became Callahan 's mentor . He taught him to choose the destination and to take the helm , preparing him to sail on his own . " By the time I reached 16 , " Callahan says , " I would call him up and he 'd tell me to take the boat out myself . " And it was n't long before Callahan was building his own craft and competing with other sailors . Fish or Biscuits ? Competition-in this case , a race across the Atlantic-brings Callahan to that fateful day in 1982 . Aboard Rubber Ducky , his food quickly runs out and his body slowly deteriorates because of lack of nutrients . He catches fish using a spear gun , which he often has to repair , lashing it together and creating makeshift tips with knife blades , then thrusting at game in the water for his sustenance . Only two of the three stills work , but he manages to remove the salt and impurities to make enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he dreams of his family and the smell of fresh biscuits around a fire . " That dream was irritating , because I was living off raw fish and barnacles , " Callahan says . " But it was a good reminder that if I could just hang on , I 'd get to taste biscuits again . " Keep Pushing On Adrift , Callahan knows it would be pure luck if ships were to see his small raft in the vast ocean . Yet he tries desperately to get their attention . He lights flares , but even ships that seem close just slide by him . Worse are the occasional middle-of-the-night wake-up calls from a hungry shark . " Part of me was really scared , saying , ' You 're gon na die , you 're gon na die , ' " Callahan says . " There 's also another voice in your head that yells , ' Stand up , get the spear , aim ! ' When you 're in a survival situation , going through constant crisis , you become very focused on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea , a large fish breaks the spear and rams it against the bottom tube of the raft . Now he has a gaping hole . Callahan does his best to patch the leak and , remarkably , lasts more than a month more on the water . When he finally reaches land on April 21 , 1982 , Callahan has lost 44 pounds and has very little energy . Yet , he is alive . Back to the Sea " The whole world was brand new again , " he says , " from the smells to the colors , everything . " Ten days later , he would be back on a sailboat , gradually making his way home to America . Callahan has since crossed the Atlantic six times and the Pacific once , but never again solo . Now in his 50 's , he lives on the coast of Maine , having spent the past two years sailing coastal Australia with his wife , Kathy . What 's left of Rubber Ducky is at the Peabody Essex Museum at Salem , Mass . His sailboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopy sits over the boat to protect sailors from the sun . More important , a sail can be hoisted so the dinghy can go against the wind and not drift aimlessly . " Using this , I could have reached the Cape Verde Islands off Africa in 14 days , not two and a half months , " he notes . That 's a lot less raw fish to swallow . Sidebar " Part of me was really seared , saying , ' You 're gon na die , you 're gon na die . ' " Callahan says . " There 's also another voice in your head that yells . ' Stand up , get the spear , aim ! ' " // Sidebar Natures Mysteries In many ways , the book " Adrift " is about the magic and mystery of the natural world . This is especially true with regards to the dorado ( also called " mahi-mahi " and " dolphin fish " ) that swam along Callahan for much of his journey . Dorado are known for seeking out objects floating on the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional raft . Within days of Callahan being forced into his raft , the dorado had somehow gauged the range of his spear gun - and kept a safe distance . Once his spear gun broke , however , and the dorado swam closer , Callahan was able to surprise the fish with his makeshift knife - and strike enough of them to eat ... and to survive . " It was like they were giving me their life so I could eat , " says the bewildered sailor . " There 's no easy explanation . " Sidebar Scouting Skills : Lifesavers The skills Steven Callahan learned as a Boy Scout served him well on the water . The ability to read a topographical map while hiking would come in handy when viewing navigational charts . The use of ropes and tying knots is extremely important for the seafaring life . Callahan 's fondest memory of his Scouting years comes from climbing the second largest peak in New England , 5,774-foot Mount Adams , in mid-February . " The ascent was grueling , " says Callahan , adding that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the end , you had these spectacular views . " // <p>
