Section : INNOVATION : PART III Innovation is n't beyond the ability of everyday companies . You just need to know how to go about it <p> THERE 'S a danger for a magazine like Inc in writing about innovation , just as there 's a danger for entrepreneurs who are seeking to make their companies more innovative . It is this : Innovation can often seem well beyond the reach of ordinary businesses . It can seem beyond the reach of ordinary mortals . <p> Just look at everything we 've chronicled in our three-part series on innovation , beginning two months ago and culminating in this issue : Companies  --  many of them in supersophisticated technical fields  --  that hold hundreds of patents . Company builders , creative types all , who seem to crank out one dazzling idea after another . Whole sectors of the economy that are built around research and development and that feed both corporations and the government with a never-ending stream of new products and services . You could get to thinking that there 's another business planet out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming up ( and patenting ) new stuff . And you could get to feeling that it 's too bad you do n't live on that planet , that you 're condemned to labor here on Earth , in the vineyards of the ordinary . <p> If that 's the way you 're feeling , you should meet Jim Throneburg . He makes socks . Innovative socks . <p> In the late 1970s , Throneburg noticed that Americans were n't buying just one pair of sneakers anymore ; when their sport changed , so did their shoes . " If the shoe changed for function , I figured I needed to design a sock that complemented the shoe , " he says . <p> As it happened , Throneburg was able to draw upon his own experience at a weight-loss clinic . There his feet were expected to carry his six-foot-four-inch , 300-pound body over miles of walking trails . " My feet were killing me , " he recalls . " So I called my R &D; guys and said , ' Make me the thickest-soled sock you can possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family 's North Carolina hosiery company , Thorlo Inc. , from a commodity business into what is arguably the most innovative sock manufacturer in the world . Throneburg harnessed Thorlo 's existing capabilities , using technology he had perfected making padded socks for the military , and pumped millions of dollars into developing new yarns and designs . So far the company has created more than 25 varieties of sport-specific socks . " Everything that 's not labor and material is R &D; as far as I 'm concerned , " he says . <p> The " R " in Thorlo 's R &D; happens not so much within its Statesville , N.C. , mill but wherever foot meets sock meets shoe , which is to say in the realm of ordinary people with ordinary problems . A woman golfer once complained to Throneburg that her socks slipped down into her shoes ; he developed a ladies ' rolltop sock for golf and tennis . Recently , Throneburg received a heartfelt letter from a man with a rare condition that caused his feet to blister . Thorlo 's socks helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throneburg make socks for his young daughters , who had inherited the condition ? " I forwarded the letter to product development , " says Throneburg . " I might need to charge him $100 a dozen , and they 'll cost me $1,000 to make . But hell , I might learn something . " <p> Throneburg 's experience illustrates a couple of fundamental truths about innovation . It can happen anywhere , in any industry , and at any time . Throneburg is an innovator in the sock business . Howard Schultz of Starbucks made his fortune by innovating in the coffee-shop business . Really , now , could you look someone straight in the eye and say there 's no room for innovation in your industry ? <p> Truth is , innovation is rarely the product of pure inspiration , that " Eureka ! " moment when some genius comes up with a wholly new idea . Rather , innovation happens when people see things differently  --  and when they arrange their companies to do what Peter Drucker calls the " organized , systematic , rational work " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two aspects of innovation is beyond the ability of conventional companies  --  nor of CEOs with conventional backgrounds . <p> Take the seeing part first . Sure , someone with a Ph.D . in molecular biology will be better equipped than most of us to spot opportunities for innovation in drug delivery . But you do n't need an advanced degree to decipher gaps in most marketplaces . Gary Hamel , chairman of innovation consulting firm Strategos , says that innovators typically view the world through four lenses . They look for deeply held conventions and challenge them ; they look for change in the world and understand the revolutionary potential of the change ; they empathize with customers and anticipate their needs ; and they view their organizations less like businesses and more like skill sets , constantly asking , " How do I creatively recombine what I know to make new things ? " <p> There 's even a shortcut to innovative seeing espoused by Tom Kelley , general manager of Ideo , a design consulting firm . Try observing people as they use a product or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have trouble , " he says , " because where there 's trouble in the status quo , that 's where your opportunity is . " <p> That 's pretty much how Kerry Gilger , now CEO of $12-million Identitech , in Melbourne , Fla. , got started . As a high school graduate laboring at a tedious desk job in Orlando , he watched all day long as the tellers from the credit union on the ground floor of the office building climbed the stairs to find customer-signature cards that were filed on the second floor . He figured there had to be a better way . Gilger had fiddled a bit with computer programming , so on the spur of the moment he called the credit union and asked the people there if they 'd be interested in software that computerized customer signatures . They said no , but they told him about another credit union that was close to purchasing just such a system . " I called them and asked them if they 'd be interested in a signature-verification system , and they told me to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls Gilger , who worked all night to bang out a program , stopped at home to put on a fresh shirt , and did a seat-of-the-pants presentation . The company 's president liked what he saw and then demanded that Gilger draw up a contract immediately . <p> So innovation rarely comes out of the blue . " In almost all cases , you are replacing something that already exists , " says Kelley . But what happens next  --  development of the idea into a product  --  is equally important . But what if you have an idea that 's beyond your own capability to develop ? Well , take the case of Richard Sweat , who worked as a junior dosimetrist planning radiation therapy for cancer patients at Boca Raton Community Hospital , in Florida . The hospital 's radiation-therapy unit " was the first job I had out of high school , " recalls Sweat . " I had very smart , creative people that I worked with who taught me well . " <p> Sweat started his own company , Southeastern Radiation Products ( SRP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was n't until some 10 years later that he hit upon an idea for a product that would establish him as an innovator . During radiation therapy , patients often use a device called a compensator to shield their vital organs ; Sweat had used them day in and day out for years . " I do n't know when the lightbulb went off , " he says , " but about five and a half years ago I decided we could improve upon what already existed . " <p> Although Sweat could clearly envision his product , he lacked the scientific background and the resources to make it . That did n't stop him . As Tom Kelley reminds us , even famously solo inventors like Thomas Edison are often teams in disguise . ( Edison came up with 400 patented ideas in six years , thanks in part to the 14 colleagues working with him . ) So it was with Sweat . He tapped two customers to help him build a prototype out of materials that had not traditionally been used to make similar products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership , a federally funded program that provides consulting services to small companies , to help him set up a lean manufacturing system . Later he forged a marketing partnership with a larger company , which helped refine and sell his product to hospitals . Result : hospitals can E-mail SRP specifications for a patient , and the company can custom-manufacture the product and ship it within 15 hours . <p> As an innovative business matures , it falls to the CEO to find ways of institutionalizing the creativity he or she once brought to the table  --  in effect , building development into the very fabric of the business . Here , too , there 's no need for advanced degrees or high-tech products . Jim Nichols innovated with septic tanks . <p> Nichols is president of Infiltrator Systems , a $100-million manufacturer of septic and storm-water systems in Old Saybrook , Conn . Back in the mid 1980s , Nichols 's own failing septic system inspired him to design a plastic septic chamber that would outperform the standard stone-and-pipe design . The concept gave birth to Infiltrator , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's bigger than his own good ideas . " Other people can leapfrog over you and take the market away from you , " he says . " So we need to be in a process of continued development . If someone is going to put us out of business , it had better be us . " <p> Nichols has put in place a series of practices that he says enable Infiltrator to " know the market so well that we can anticipate what customers need before they need it . " First and foremost among those practices is gathering information  --  from customers , industry reports , and the contractors who install Infiltrator 's systems . Vice-president of engineering Bryan Coppes says that Infiltrator 's marketing team recently made a product presentation to contractors , and their feedback resulted in significant design changes . " We get in front of the customer and throw out an idea before we actually tool things up , " he says . Nichols adds that industry research once inspired him to design a leach field with a more robust sidewall , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started changing their specifications , Infiltrator had a clear market advantage . To systematize that kind of information gathering , the company now pays $4,500 a year for a subscription to Nerac , a database service that enables Infiltrator 's department managers to plug in keywords and get back a constant flow of E-mail with the latest industry trends , patents , and trade-magazine articles . <p> Ideas are just the beginning , of course , and the way Infiltrator assesses them has changed radically over the past three years . It was , products were being developed . Four years ago the company 's new storm-water-management system failed repeatedly , triggering multiple lawsuits from customers and leading Infiltrator to file for Chapter n protection to manage the claims . The company 's core business not only survived but grew , and creditors and claimants were paid in full when the company emerged from bankruptcy , in September 2000 . But the product failure was a wake-up call . <p> Enter Stage Gate , a new product-evaluation tool that involves employees throughout the company . Ideas come from Infiltrator 's salespeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company who know its reputation for bringing new products to market . Every idea is guided through a series of " gates " by a champion  --  either the person who first conceived of the idea or someone in the company who is impassioned enough to develop and refine it . A project team performs R &D,; market research , pilot studies , and financial analyses , then makes a recommendation to an evaluation team consisting of Nichols and other top executives . The first product to come out of Stage Gate was a new storm-water-management system , which replaced the product that so vexed the company four years ago . Introduced in January , after three years and $7 million in R &D,; it is being " enthusiastically received in the marketplace , " says Nichols . <p> In the past three years , two new products and three innovations to existing products have come out of the Stage Gate process ; another seven ideas are now in the system . About half the product ideas that go through Stage Gate come to fruition ; the rest die in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game . " You have to set up a culture where people are allowed to try things and to make mistakes . I say to people , ' If you 're not making any mistakes , you 're fiat out not trying hard enough . ' " Case in point : Bryan Coppes was the project leader for the storm-water system that failed . It was Coppes who championed the new system through Stage Gate . <p> The moral of such stories ? Innovation , so it is said , is the stuff of progress , the engine of the U.S. economy , the generator of profits for business and wealth for society . Here at Inc we take no issue with any such pronouncements ; indeed , we believe them wholeheartedly . But do n't be misled by what you might call the glitz surrounding innovative people and companies . There is a world of Ph.D . ' s and patents , of scientific luminaries , of dazzling and complex new technologies and the well-funded businesses that bring them to market . But that 's only one realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet is made up of companies that are probably much like yours , run by people whose claim to fame is n't scientific genius , only the ability to see things that others overlook and to bring those new ideas to the marketplace . <p> SOLE MAN : " Everything that 's not labor and material is R &D,"; says Jim Throneburg , whose company has created more than 25 varieties of socks . <p> By Donna Fenn and Jonn Case <p> <p> Donna Fenn ( incfenn@aol.com ) is a contributing editor at Inc .
