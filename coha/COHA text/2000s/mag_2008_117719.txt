THE GRIP is golf 's most profound fundamental . All of the game 's contradictions  --  simultaneous demands for control and release , delicacy and power  --  are contained in the hands . Nothing is as vital , as subtle or as kingdom-unlocking . There is Zen in the grip . // There 's also a good chance that there 's something wrong with the way you hold the club . Harvey Penick was a gold mine on the subject . " If you do n't have a good grip , you do n't want to play good golf , " he said . And , " I can go on talking about the grip until it 's too deep for even me to understand . " // Plainly , the simple act of holding a club is an art , and hands that do it well resemble Da Vinci drawings . But there 's bad art too , even among the best players . LPGA Hall of Famer Judy Rankin guaranteed herself a hook with a left hand so strong ( that is , with the thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside down . David Duval and Paul Azinger close the club face with similar strangleholds , while Fred Couples flips it open . Snooping on Tour revealed a few quirks . Todd Hamilton tries to engineer a fade by having his grips turned a bit to the right . J.L. Lewis insists on having his compressed exactly a quarter of an inch , so that they 're 10 1/4 " in length instead of 10 1/2 " . Some players like the thicker rubber of the .580-inch diameter grip ; others prefer the .600s . ( We 're talking about the diameter of the hole at the end of the grip , of course , not the width on the outside , which is the same for either grip . ) They play around with the tape underneath  --  buildups under the right hand , for example , or more wraps to remove the taper . They 're sensitive as surgeons , some of them , so we asked 10 heirs of Harry Vardon for their gripping tales . // JESPER PARNEVIK Yes , I 've heard the quote about holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird would be strangled for sure with my grip . Oh , heck yeah . See , my knuckles go white . Even my putting grip is tight  --  tight enough to wear out the grip in places . I 've putted with a glove forever , but I 've worn putter grips all the way down to the metal . That 's a little weird . // CHARLES HOWELL In 2002 I went from the interlock to the overlap . I practiced overlapping in November , December and January . It 's true that the grip is the most difficult thing in golf to change . I 'm always working on my hand strength with weights or gadgets . My hands are big , so I use the .580 grips built up with five wraps of tape . The .600s feel too thin . // ARRON OBERHOLSER I think Lee Janzen , Fred Couples , Corey Pavin and I are the only guys on Tour without a glove . I use the interlock , and no , my hands are n't small . The club absolutely feels different every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can make your fingers swell . When my fingers thin out and the grip feels smaller , I know I 'm going to have a good week . // K.J. CHOI My grip is always the same . I never had a coach . I learned from Jack Nicklaus 's book Golf My Way , which was published in Korean in 1984 . I started playing in 1985 . A pro from Gwangju would check on me . My grip pressure is 70% . The grip is the most basic fundamental , and I stress getting all the areas of the hands stuck together , but getting a good grip is more difficult than going to the dentist . // ANTHONY KIM My dad Paul was a good player , but did I get my grip from him ? I hope not ! The only similarity is that we put the right hand on the bottom . I learned the grip from magazines . As you can see , there 's separation between each of my fingers . I think about the grip before each shot . My preshot routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my left hand before I lay on the right hand . // BILL HAAS I got my grip from my dad Jay mostly , not from my great-uncle Bob Goalby , but maybe there was a trickle-down effect . I know Bob always fought a hook . I used to be much stronger in the left hand . Then I went much weaker and now neutral . I hold it harder to hit a fade and looser on a draw . But ball position and stance are the way to work the ball , in my opinion , not the grip . // JERRY KELLY There 's only one other grip like this in the world . When I was 12 , my dad Jack said , " O.K. , at the first snow we 're changing that 10-finger grip . " So he showed me how he held it , and I practiced it all winter . It felt natural by spring . Just like my dad , I dig the tip of my left index finger right into the rubber . It really marries my hands . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was always a good putter , but very streaky . I tried everything  --  split grip , long putter , left hand low . When Skip Kendall showed me the Claw , I looked at him like he was crazy . At first I used it from four feet in , then eight feet and then , after a month , from everywhere . My grip 's a little different from Mark Calcavecchia 's  --  I have all four fingers on top instead of two , I think , for Calc. // STEWART CINK I used 10 fingers , like a baseball bat , until I learned to interlock when I was eight . I 've held it the same way ever since . I see this all the time at pro-ams : Someone will have to bend it around trees , or hit a high bunker shot . I 'll say , " You need to close it down , or open it up , " and they simply turn their hands . You should turn the club , then grip it again with your normal grip . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to hit the ball right to left . I weaken my left hand for bunker shots . Palmer 's instructor , Neil Wilkins : " The first time Ryan came to me , I said , ' I want you to stop regripping . ' The instant before he took the club back , he moved his right hand down into a much stronger position  --  it was his swing trigger . No wonder he fought a hook .
