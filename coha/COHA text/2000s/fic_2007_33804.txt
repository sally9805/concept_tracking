Chapter One They were sitting on old buckets , scaling fish beneath an almond tree , when someone pointed to the water and they all began to shout . They were hardy children who 'd been raised in isolation on a crescent beach below a cliff , and had experienced many horrors-drownings , stabbings , births , and storms . But when they saw a one-eyed monster rising from the deep , they dropped their tools and dashed off in a blur of skirts and faded tunics to the clump of shacks in which they lived , raising clouds of sand as white as salt . The eldest girl , Estrella Thompson , would be fifteen soon , and thought herself mature . She 'd recently begun to read , which had created an awareness of a universe beyond San Carlos . So , unlike her friends , she was interested in the war . The war was taking place in Europe , a place she 'd only heard about the year before . Poland . Antwerp . Riga . Spain . The names were sparkling gems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the dreams of all her neighbors in the cove . So on the rare occasions that she 'd had the chance to travel into town , she 'd steal away to loiter in the little shops in Woodley , the district of the artisans adjacent to the port . There , she 'd listen to the intonations of the BBC announcer on the redifusion box and be transported like a person who 'd gone to see a medium for a glimpse of life across the void into the other world . On these nights more than others , as she curled up in the hammock she shared with other girls beneath a shed beside her old grandmother 's hut , Estrella would gaze outside the window as she fingered old newspapers and her cache of stolen books , dreaming of the day when she 'd be rescued from this place where nothing happened . So while the others ran , she hid behind the almond tree and watched in fearful fascination as the creature loomed . It was n't until the mask had been removed that Estrella , who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , understood that what she thought had been a monster was a human being-a scuba diver in a rubber suit . She stepped out from behind the tree and walked toward him in her old blue frock with eyelet lace around the hem , hips moving widely underneath the faded fabric , giving insight to the marvel of her shape . She was tall and bigboned with mannish shoulders and a long face with sharp cheeks . Her eyes were bright and slanted , and although her skin was darker than a Coke , she had a length of wavy hair . " What are you wearing ? " she asked in English , which she rarely had the need to use , since everyone around her spoke Sancoche . " It lets me breathe beneath the water . " They talked for several minutes , during which he explained some of his duties ; then he disappeared below the surf . In Sancoche , her native dialect , Estrella kept repeating as the ripples disappeared , " I never even thought to dream of seeing a thing like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stupidness . " Two days had passed , and Tucker Ross had heard the story many times from many people , but most often from the girl , his granddaughter by the common law . " Big Tuck , " she said , insistently , " is true . " He fanned as if her words were buzzing insects . " A man ca n't breathe underwater no matter what he put on his body or his head , Estrella . I really think is a mermaid you see . It have different kinds , you know . And I heard it have some that look like man , in truth . " They 'd just completed dinner , and Estrella , who 'd replayed her visitation many times , had told the story once again , with every detail in its place-the fellow was a blue-eyed Yankee soldier , and he 'd told her he was part of something called " man hoovers , " which meant he and some other men were practicing a thing they had to do . And the thing they had to practice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waterline and blow them up . The night was hot , and she was sitting on a woven mat beneath the hut in which she lived with Big Tuck and her grandmother , Roselyn-a dark , thick-featured woman with a golden tooth that twinkled when she talked . Roselyn had arrived in San Carlos in the 1920s from Havana , but she was n't Cuban . She was a Trinidadian who 'd gone to work in Cuba as a waistress in the early 1900s , brooding as she served her body to the Yankee soldiers stationed on the island to secure it in the nom de guerre of freedom-whose baptismal name is profit-after the Spanish-American War . If she could , she would 've returned to Trinidad ; but word had traveled to her mother that she was a prostitute ; and her mother , who for years had kept Roselyn 's children , sent a message that she 'd bought a special cricket bat to beat them nasty ways out of her dirty , worthless daughter if she ever came to Trinidad again . When Roselyn moved to San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter born in Havana ... father unknown . Years later , when this daughter died in labor , Roselyn went to Cuba for her newborn child . Almost dead at birth , that child , Estrella Thompson , grew up to be advanced beyond her years . Like the other dwellings in the camp , the hut was roofed in thatch and set at shoulder height on wooden stilts . On the hottest evenings , Estrella and her family would eat below it on the shaded sand , which had been shielded from the heat . " Is not stupidness , " she offered in the rumbling cadence of Sancoche . " It have a lot o ' things going on in this world we ai n't know ' bout up here down this coast . Even in town things going on . Is only we do n't know nothing . All we know is fish . Catch fish . Scale fish . Eat fish . Fry fish . " Big Tuck sat with his belly pressing on his dark brown shirt . He was squat and hairy , with skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bulky still from rowing boats and pulling nets for almost all his eighty years . " I ai n't disbelieve you when you say you see what you say you see , " he told her in a silly voice that made her younger cousins giggle and her old grandmother laugh . " But all I know is that a man ca n't breathe underwater no matter what he put on . I ai n't have to go to no school to know that . " " You know from the other day she start to read she getting different , " Roselyn said with a gentle tease . " She start to know everything-even things that nobody ai n't suppose to know until they dead . Because is only when you dead you can see certain things . I ai n't think it was a mermaid at all . I think she dead in truth and see a ghost . " " When she tell me that she teach herself to read , I frighten , " said Big Tuck with admiration . He tapped Estrella 's leg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tuck , she 's a child , you know . She ai n't suppose to drink no rum . It ai n't have any beer ? " " Rose , you ai n't see she 's a woman ? Leave the blasted child alone . " " Tuck , " implored Estrella , smiling at him warmly , as she smoked and took a swig . " Look how long I tell you send me to school . But you only want keep me here to fish . " " Estrella , " he replied , easing Roselyn from his lap and taking on a more attentive pose , " if you was in town right now , and the boss man come and ask you what kind o ' work you want to do , what you would tell him , in truth ? " " I ai n't know what kind o ' work there is , " Estrella answered promptly . " But I could work in a shop or in the bank . As long as you could count , you could do them kind o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than selling fish ? Things is things . If you could sell one thing you could sell another thing , as long as you know how it measure , and how much a measure is the price . And most things they sell in these shops ai n't have to measure . They just sell off a shelf one by one . All I would have to do is put them in a bag , make sure I give the right change , and do n't insult nobody , which to me might be the hardest part , because in truth it have some people who will agitate you nerves . " " Is where you getting these thoughts ? " her grandmother asked . A tone of slight concern had seeped into her voice . " I have it in my head long time to do something , Grandma . But I just ai n't get the chance to even know what I could do . How I going to know ? Who going tell me ? Them people here ? " She gestured broadly . " I ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I leave here , and he tell me I could do anything if I only put my mind . " " So , " her grandmother said , " you let a stranger tell you what to do with you life ? " " You know it have a lot o ' educated dunces in this world , " Big Tuck pointed out . " Take Rawle boy . They send he away to university in the mother country and I hear he ai n't pass no exam . I hear is bare zero he getting up at the place there ... " He paused to find the word . " Camron or Campton or Cam Ditch or some rass . That and Oxfam is the two biggest school they have in England they say . What kind o ' man get opportunity like that and come back with two long hand and no qualification ... no doctor ... no engineer ... no barrister ? That is why I keep myself right here . Rawle ai n't know the white man school hard like brick or he would n't gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me ? I stick with what I know . The fish in my blood . And Estrella , it in your blood too . If you let that go is death . " " If I stay here and do n't do nothing with myself then that would kill me worse , " she blurted , adding childish frills along her intonation . For although Big Tuck was funny , he was quick to take offense . And when he was upset he could be cruel . They ai n't understanding what I trying to say , Estrella thought . But maybe I should keep it to myself . She 'd not been led to reading by a great ambition-that was something reading had produced . But this was n't easy to explain . A year before , in 1941 , on a market trip to the capital , Seville , she 'd wandered off while running errands , and had taken up a spot across the street from La Sala de Amor to watch the cars arriving with the idle wives of businessmen and English civil servants . La Sala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many mansions on the Queensway to be sold for business use . It was large and white , with thick limestone columns ; and between the columns ran a lacy banister whose loops and swirls in black conferred a lingerie allure to anyone who dined on the veranda , basking in the currents driven by the celebrated fan , an engineering marvel that was bolted to the ceiling and whose giant wings , which had been woven in the previous century from a fiber that grew only in the Yucatn , made slow , gigantic swoops . The Queens , as people called it , was an upward-sloping mile that started at a square beside the harbor and ended at the governor 's imposing gate . In Spanish times it had been known as the Paseo , and was the site of much parading by the rich . In its center was a flowered median lined with rows of royal palms , curving trails with benches made of heavy wood , and gas-illuminated globes that seeped a misty sentimental light . That day , as she watched the wives arriving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who often bought fish from her grandmother , and she tried to make a sale . " Oyi ! " she shouted from a bench beneath a tree . " It have some good jack and parrot today . Nice bonito too . I save up some for you . When you finish you should come . " With his finger quickly brought across his lip , the man , whose job was marked by nothing more official than a visor , tossed his head , inviting her to cross the street . There , he introduced her to another driver as " the smartest little girl you 'll ever meet . " " What kind o ' woman you calling little girl ? " the man replied . He wore a pith helmet and an ivory jacket with a scarlet sash . " She overgrow , " the man she knew remarked . " Overgrow and overripe . " " Is the fish she eating make her bottom juicy so ? " While the drivers talked about her as if she was n't there , Estrella watched the people on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something designed to be unseen . When a husband moved across the veranda to greet a friend who 'd just arrived , a waiter slipped his wife a note that had been scribbled by another man , a quiet diner seated by himself across the aisle . The reaction to the written word was something that the girl had never seen . The lady 's face , which before the note had been as plain and inexpressive as an egg , began to crackle with a smile . It was a smile that was n't triggered by the mouth , that only ended there , that looked as if it had begun somewhere inside the woman 's liquid core . And that was when Estrella knew that writing was an elemental force , like hurricanes and floods , and began to visualize the stream of words she 'd like to share with someone she loved . That very day , she stole the first of many books , a language primer slid beneath the skirt along an aisle in McSweeney 's , followed by a lesson here and there in phonics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eight-year-old girl who worked behind the counter in her father 's Chinese shop . However , in the weeks that followed her encounter with the diver , Estrella 's greatest problem was n't books . It was the Star . Before she 'd begun to read , the daily paper was a thing-a thing a mother used to line the box she turned into a cradle ; a thing a child would fold to make a hat when it would rain ; a thing that everybody used to wipe their bottoms ; a yellow thing you picked out of the garbage when you went to town ; a thing for everyone to use . But in the weeks that followed her encounter , Estrella had begun to keep some papers for herself . Because no one believed her story , she began to read the papers with the single-minded effort of a lawyer on the quest for vindicating proof . And to her family and neighbors , it appeared as if she 'd pulled away . It unsettled them to watch her reading ... smiling to herself ... whispering fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head bowed like she praying to the damn rass thing . If you play you drum or pluck you cuatro when the gal was reading one , she 'd walk away . What kind o ' thing is that ? And when she come back after she done walk away and you ask her what it really have inside that thing , she only want to tell you things ' bout other places-like where we from ai n't place . So although they were amazed that one of them had learned to read , they also felt as if the girl had put them under siege , a sense that if they did n't act , then history would remember them as people who 'd watched and waited while their way of life was slowly laid to waste . As days turned into weeks , Estrella found herself preparing fish beneath the almond tree alone . People whispered . When they had too much to drink sometimes , they 'd lob their blazing words . Is them things you reading in them papers have you head so tie up . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children can be devious ? If is you dead mother telling you things to come and confuse us , well , is a good thing she gone . Intimidated by their parents and confused , the children who 'd been with Estrella when the diver waded from the surf began to doubt what they 'd seen . Pressured by his parents , a boy began to spread the rumor that Estrella had confided that the story was a hoax . Two girls swore on a Bible that they 'd seen a mermaid flopping on the shore , long hair , gold comb , and all . But most of them just shook their heads when asked and mumbled that they did n't know , that yes , they were there , but did n't see , that so much time had passed . Through all of this , Estrella found a way to manage . But when her younger cousins , candid children , told her that it might be better if she went away , she left the hammock where she slept with them and made a bed inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cave , fifty yards beyond the almond tree .
