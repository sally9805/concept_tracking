Chapter 2 : If We Could Talk to Animals // What is the communication style you use with your dog ? Do you implore him to come to you , while he refuses , continuing to run down the street after a neighborhood squirrel ? When your dog steals your favorite slipper , do you talk baby talk to him to try to get it back ? Do you scream at the top of your lungs for your dog to get off the furniture , while he just sits there , staring at you as if you ? re crazy ? If any of these sounds like you , I know you ? re aware that the techniques you ? re using aren ? t working . You understand that you can ? t " reason " with a dog , but you simply don ? t know any other way to communicate with him . I ? m here to tell you that there ? s a much better way . // Remember the story of Dr. Dolittle , the man who was able to speak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? From the Hugh Lofting books to the 1928 silent film , to the thirties radio series , to the 1967 movie musical and seventies cartoons , to the blockbuster Eddie Murphy comedies , this wonderful tale and its main character have appealed to children and adults generation after generation . Just think of the countless worlds that would be unlocked if we saw things as animals see them . Imagine looking down at the earth through the eyes of a soaring bird , moving through life in three dimensions like a whale , or " seeing " the world through sound waves , the way bats do . Who hasn ? t dreamed of such thrilling possibilities ? The attraction of the Dr. Dolittle story is that it brings animals to life , in big-screen living color . // What would you say if I told you that Doctor Dolittle ? s secret was more than just creative fiction ? // Perhaps you ? re imagining this secret from a human perspective . // You ? re wondering if I ? m telling you that there ? s a verbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of a phrase book that translates your language into his . What would his language look like , sound like , you wonder ? Would it include the words sit , stay , come , and heel ? Would you have to shout the translations , or could you whisper them ? Would you have to learn how to whimper and bark ? Sniff your pet ? s behind ? And how would your dog answer you back ? How would you translate what he was saying ? As you can see , creating a dog-to-human phrase book  --  the way , say , an English-to-Spanish phrase book is created  --  would be a very complicated effort indeed . // Wouldn ? t it be simpler if there was a universal language that every species could understand ? " Impossible , " you say . " Even human beings don ? t all speak the same language ! " True , but that hasn ? t kept people from trying to find a common language for centuries . In the ancient world , all the higher-class , educated people learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the most important documents . In the Christian era , anybody who was anybody knew how to read and write Latin . // Today , English is at the top of the language food chain . I learned this the hard way when I first arrived in America fourteen years ago . Believe me , if you ? re not born speaking it , English is a monster of a language to learn from scratch  --  yet everyone from the Chinese to the Russians now accept it as the international language of business . Humans have sought other ways to breach the language barrier . No matter what language you speak , if you ? re blind , you can use Braille . If you ? re deaf , you can understand any other deaf person using International Sign Language . Mathematics and computer languages cross many linguistic borders and allow humans of different tongues to converse easily with one another , thanks to the power of technology . // If humans can succeed in designing these collective languages , can ? t we create a way to converse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a language we can learn that means the same thing to every creature ? // Good news ! I ? m happy to report that the universal language of Doctor Dolittle already exists . And humans didn ? t invent it . It ? s a language all animals speak without even knowing it , including the human animal . What ? s more , all animals are actually born knowing this language instinctually . Even human beings are born fluent in this universal tongue , but we tend to forget it because we are trained from childhood to believe that words are the only way to communicate . The irony is , even though we don ? t think we know the language anymore , we are actually speaking it all the time . Unknowingly , we are broadcasting in this tongue 24-7 ! Other species of animals can still understand us , even though we may not have a clue how to understand them . They read us loud and clear , even when we ? re unaware that we ? re communicating ! // This truly universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wild // How can energy be a language ? Let me give you some examples . In the wild , different animal species intermingle effortlessly . Take the African savannah or a jungle , for instance . At a watering hole in a jungle , you might see monkeys and birds in the trees , or on a savannah , different plant eaters , such as zebras or gazelles , wandering around , happily drinking out of the same crystal-clear pond . All is peaceful , despite the many different species sharing the same space . How do they all get along so smoothly ? // How about a less exotic example ? In your own backyard you may have squirrels , birds , rabbits , even foxes , all happily coexisting . There ? s no trouble until you rev up your lawnmower. // Why ? Because all these animals are communicating with the same relaxed , balanced , non-confrontational energy . Every animal knows that all the other animals are just hanging out , doing their own thing  --  drinking water , foraging for food , relaxing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one ? s attacking anyone else . Unlike us , they don ? t have to ask one another how they ? re feeling . The energy they are projecting tells them everything they need to know . In that sense , they are speaking to one another , all the time . // Now that you ? ve got this peaceful vision in your mind , imagine this : Suddenly , a new animal enters your backyard , or approaches our imaginary jungle waterhole , projecting a completely different energy . This new energy could be something as minor as one squirrel trying to plunder another ? s stash , or a gazelle jockeying another gazelle for a better drinking position at the oasis . It could also be as serious as a hungry predator seeking to subdue its next prey . Ever notice how a whole group of peaceful animals can turn scared or defensive in an instant , sometimes even before a predator has shown itself on the scene ? They probably got a whiff of its scent  --  but it ? s also probable that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s always amazing to me about the animal kingdom is that even if a predator is near , all the other animals can usually tell if it ? s safe to stay around it or not . Imagine being introduced to a man you knew to be a serial killer . Would you be able to relax in his presence ? Of course not ! But if you were another kind of animal on this planet , you would probably be able to sense whether the serial killer was on the prowl or simply kicking back . Animals immediately recognize when a predator is projecting a hunting energy , sometimes even before they spot the predator itself . As humans , we are so often blind to these nuances in animal energy  --  we think a tiger is dangerous at all times , when , really , if he ? s just eaten a three hundred-pound deer , he ? s probably more tired than treacherous . The moment his tummy gets empty , however , he ? s a different animal  --  all instinct , all survival energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . Yet we humans tend to be blind to what , in the animal kingdom , is pretty much a flashing red light . // Here ? s an example of animal energy that folks who live in the American South can probably relate to . On a sunny day in Florida , Louisiana , or the Carolinas , you ? ll see giant alligators sunning their leathery bodies on the banks of swamps  --  all over expensive , exclusive golf courses ! Meanwhile , golfers are teeing off a few feet away . Herons and cranes and turtles are happily sunning themselves right next to these terrifying reptiles . Eightypound old ladies are walking their teacup-size dogs on footpaths just inches from the alligators ? swamp . What ? s going on here ? It ? s simple . The other animals  --  from the turtles to the teacup Chihuahuas  --  are aware , on an instinctual level , that these fearsome predators aren ? t in a hunting mode at the moment . One thing you can be sure of  --  when the same big creature ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode , the rest of the animals will be gone in the blink of an eye . Except maybe the golfers . But they are one of the strangest species in nature , and even modern science hasn ? t figured them out yet . // Energy in Humans // When it comes to energy , we humans have much more in common with animals than we usually like to admit . Imagine one of the most ruthless jungles in the human world  --  the high school cafeteria . Picture it as a watering hole where different species  --  in this case , the cliques of jocks , nerds , and stoners  --  peacefully intermingle . Then a bully " accidentally " bumps into a smaller guy ? s food tray . The energy released by that interaction will ripple right through the entire room . Ask your teenager if this isn ? t true . And exactly as in the animal kingdom , this energy shift doesn ? t even have to be as blatant as a shove . Let ? s say the little guy in the cafeteria is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests in a row and is in a weak state of mind . He happens to look up and accidentally catch the eye of the bully . Maybe the bully was just minding his own business , but as soon as he picks up on the weaker guy ? s diminished energy , the whole dynamic between them changes in a split second . In the animal kingdom , that ? s called survival of the fittest . // Let ? s take this concept beyond the school lunchroom and think about our society as whole . Right or wrong , we in America expect our leaders to project a dominant , powerful energy , like that of a Bill Clinton or a Ronald Reagan . Some powerful leaders project a charismatic energy that infects and energizes everyone around them  --  consider Tony Robbins . Martin Luther King , Jr. , projected an energy that was what I call " calm-assertive "  --  the ideal energy for a leader . Though Gandhi was also a leader , his energy was of a more compassionate nature . // It ? s interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet that will follow a wise , kind , compassionate , or lovable leader . Humans will even follow an unstable leader , but that ? s another book in itself ! As difficult as it may be for us to understand , in the animal kingdom , a Fidel Castro would win out as leader over a Mother Teresa any day . In the animal world , there is no morality , no right and wrong . Conversely , animals never cheat or lie their way to power  --  they can ? t . Other animals would figure them out in a heartbeat . Nature ? s leaders must project the most obvious and uncontestable strength . In the animal kingdom , there are only rules , routines , and rituals  --  based on survival of the strongest , not of the smartest or fairest. // Ever hear of " the smell of fear " ? That ? s not just an expression . Animals sense vibrations of energy , but smell is their next strongest sense  --  and in a dog , energy and scent seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glands when they are afraid , emitting a smell that ? s distinctive not only to other dogs but to most animals ( including us ) . A dog ? s sense of smell is connected to the limbic system , the part of the brain responsible for emotion . In his book The Dog ? s Mind , Dr. Bruce Fogle cites studies from the 1970s that showed that dogs can detect butyric acid  --  one of the components of human perspiration  --  at up to a million times ? lower concentration than we can.1 Think of lie detector sensors that can pick up minute changes in the perspiration on a person ? s hands when she is being deceptive . In essence , your dog is a living , breathing " lie detector " ! // Do dogs actually physically " smell " fear in us ? They certainly can sense it instantly . Countless joggers and mail carriers relate this harrowing experience  --  running or walking past a house and causing the dog there to bark , growl , or even charge the fence or gate . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of protector of the house and takes that role very seriously  --  and too many mail carriers and joggers have the scars to show how powerful , aggressive dogs  --  what I call red-zone dogs  --  get out of control . ( Red-zone dogs are serious business , and I ? ll address them in depth in a later chapter. ) // For the purposes of understanding how dogs sense emotional states , imagine this as you walk by a house with a red-zone dog in it : Perhaps the barking dog has a secret . He may be more afraid of you than you are of him ! Once you freeze up in terror , however , the balance of power instantly changes . Does the dog pick up on your energy shift through his " sixth sense " ? Or does he smell some change in your body or brain chemistry ? Science hasn ? t spelled it all out in layman ? s terms as of yet , but in my opinion , it ? s a combination of both . I can be sure of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff " a dog the way you might be able to bluff a drunken poker buddy . Once you shift into the emotion of fear , that dog instantly knows he has an advantage over you . You are projecting a weak energy . And if the dog gets out , you are much more likely to be rushed or bitten than if you had tuned out the barking and simply gone on with your day . In the natural world , the weak get weeded out quickly . There ? s no right or wrong about it  --  it ? s just the way life on earth has worked for millions of years . // Energy and Emotion // The most important thing to understand about energy is that it ? s a language of emotion . Of course you never have to tell an animal that you ? re sad , or tired , or excited , or relaxed , because that animal already knows exactly how you ? re feeling . Think back on some of the beautiful stories you ? ve read in publications like Reader ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have comforted , even saved , their sick , depressed , or grieving owners . //
