Headnote Energy Star 4.0-rated products can lower your energy bill and reduce the amount of pollutants in the world-but by somewhat less than you might hope . PCW Test Center PCs ADORNED with green-certification logos look and work like their nongrcen counterparts . But do n't expect a single PC to help you rack up huge savings in your energy bill or significantly shrink the size of your computing carbon footprint . Those benefits come from purchasing in bulk . And whether you buy one PC or a thousand , you 'll do more for the environment and your finances by adjusting your system 's settings . We learned this by testing five Energy Star 4.0-rated Vista PCs-three desktops and two notebooks . Dell 's OptiPlex 755 Mini-Tower and HP 's rp5700 Long Lifecycle Desktop are designed for use as business PCs ; Enano Computers ' EX7200 straddles business and consumer lines . ( Enano gained a measure of fame by supplying the PCs that powered the video streaming for the Al Gore-promoted Live Earth concert . ) On the notebook side , we looked at Lenovo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to Energy Star certification , HP 's rp5700 , Dell 's OptiPlex 755 , and Toshiba 's Tecra M9-S5514 earned the stringent Gold certification of the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool ( EPEAT ) . EPEAT rates desktops , laptops , and monitors at Bronze , Silver , and Gold levels , based on the percentage of 23 required and 28 optional criteria the product meets-for example , recycling , reduction in the use of toxic materials , and energy efficiency . While this story focuses on energy issues , all units underwent regular WorldBench 6 Beta 2 performance benchmark testing as well , and you can find standard PCW-rated reviews of them online . See the box , below left , for additional information . Realistic Efficiency Among the new requirements for Energy Star 4.0 , which took effect in July 2007 , are more-stringent maximum power draws during a PC 's idle ( on but not active ) mode . The specific requirements vary by type of PC ( notebook or desktop ) and performance class ( A , B , or C ) , as determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.0 requirements do n't always anticipate day-to-day computer use . When we set out to test power consumption , our goal was not to verify the Energy Star 4.0 certification of these products but to measure their real-world power appetites . Using our own tests , we found that the power that the notebooks drew while in their idle state exceeded the 22 watts specified by Energy Star 4.0 . The reason : Our assumptions about notebook use were less conservation-conscious than the ones in the Energy Star 4.0 testing guidelines . For example , we left the laptops ' LCD screens and Wi-Fi radios turned on , but the EPA 's testing guidelines say to turn off Wi-Fi and to power down a notebook 's screen ( a significant draw on power ) after 1 minute . The bottom line : How you use your PC is just as important for power consumption as the product you buy . For example , we found that if you want to lower your PC 's power consumption further , you can disable overlooked features such as a biometrie security chip and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enano 's EX7200 , which uses a laptop processor , consumed the least power . When idling , it drew only 24 watts . In a working state , the Enano EX7200 also proved more energy-efficient than the other desktops . The EX7200 and the OptiPlex 755 completed the World-Bench 6 Beta 2 multitasking script in about the same time , but the EX7200 used less power to do so . HP 's rp5700 consumed more power across the board compared with the other units . In idle , it consumed 52 watts . But let 's keep things in perspective : When we tested the power consumption of an Alienware Area-51 7500 , a screaming-fast gaming PC that exhibits no discernible regard for energy efficiency , it consumed a whopping 418 watts while idling ( idling , as in not doing anything at all ) . But how much green will a green PC save ? On its own , not much . Using the EPA 's model of computer usage and the U.S. Energy Information Administration 's statistics on the average retail price of residential electricity , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run , while HP 's rp5700 costs $6.16 , and Enano 's PC sets you back $3.47 annually . But multiply such numbers by a hundred or a thousand-to reflect all of the PCs in a large company , say-and the savings can add up to a lot . That might be reason enough to choose energy-efficient business PCs when buying in bulk . That logic also holds true when it comes to a company 's environmental footprint . Using the EPA conversion figures , we calculated that one Alienware Area-51 7500 is responsible for producing 568 pounds of QO , emissions per year , while one Lenovo ThinkPad T61p must answer for just 54 pounds . That means using 20 Area-51 7500 PCs for a year is equivalent to putting one car on the road . You 'd need to use 250 T61p 's to equal that one car . Green , But Quick For mainstream business and consumer users , green PCs perform like other PCs . Dell 's OptiPlex 755 earned a WorldBench score of 84 - tops among the business PCs we 've tested with Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below average , but the PC scored well enough in other areas to rank third on our value business desktops chart . Lenovo 's ThinkPad T61p , which ranked third in our online desktop replacement notebook chart , earned a stellar WorldBench score of 81 , and its battery life of 4 hours , 3 minutes is above average . TheT61p produced solid graphics scores , thanks to its nVidia Quadro FX570M discrete mobile workstation graphics . Toshiba 's Tecra M9 , which we tested for our all-purpose notebook chart , earned a WorldBench score of 73-average for the notebooks we 've tested - and an unimpressive battery life result of 2 hours , 48 minutes . But until we can purchase solar-powered PCs , using an Energy Star-certified computer is the best way to reduce energy use and costs . - Narasu Rebbapragada Sidebar MORE ONLINE Go to find.pcworld.com/562A2 to read detailed reviews of these products and see where they rank on our value desktop PC , desktop-replacement laptop , and all-purpose laptop charts .

A preproduction unit we tested was very efficient-but you do n't add software to it or store most files locally . You essentially rent the Zonbu. paying $99 down plus $13 per month for 25GB of online storage . Fifteen dollars per month gets you 50GB of storage , and $20 gets you 100GB . The only internal storage is a 4GB Compact Flash card . Plus , Zonbu is a closed system . The company , not you , is the administrator of your box . It preloads open-source photo , productivity , music , and other applications , and pushes out all software and OS updates automatically . That 's low-maintenance , but also limiting . While idling , the Zonbu consumed only 9.6 watts of power . It felt slow when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zonbu 's CEO , Grgoire Gentil , says that 's because it uses an energy-optimized Linux kernel and applications designed for it . Zonbu purchases carbon offsets so it can say that its PC is the first " zero-emissions computer . " ( Companies aim to compensate for or " offset " their greenhouse gas emissions by funding environmental projects that reduce them . ) Whether you believe in carbon offsets or not , you can feel good about the Zonbu 's low power consumption . And when you 're done with your unit , the company will recycle it responsibly .
