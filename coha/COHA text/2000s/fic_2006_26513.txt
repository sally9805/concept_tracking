Sexy Chapter One Soon as he turned sixteen , put on weight and began to get attention for his looks , things began to turn weird . Being a swimmer , advanced to the varsity team at the end of his sophomore year at North Falls High , also a promising diver , what Coach called " up-and-coming , " he got more attention . People began to say how good-looking he was . In the street , older girls and even women in their twenties would turn to watch him . Even some teachers , teasing : " Darren Flynn could pass for Brad Pitt 's younger brother . " Oh , sure ! Darren went red in the face , glowered and turned his lower lip inside out to look as ugly as possible . To hide his odd silvery-gold bait , he wore a grungy Red Sox cap reversed on his head . A grungy NFH purple-and-cream sweatshirt frayed at the cuffs Rotted old salt-stained Nikes on his size-eleven feet . In a hot mood , his skin erupted at his hairline . And across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girls liked to say about Darren Flynn that he he was sexy , but shy . Or he was shy , but sexy . Darren was a guy 's guy , basically . Unmistakably a jock . Laughing and relaxed with his friends , but with girls this weird kind of light would come into his face as if his mind were struck blank . Like he could see how girls were drawn to him like those sad little moths drawn to the light , beating their wing and crowding one another desperate for the light , and when it 's switched off , the little moths are like , What ? What happened ? Where is  --  ? Darren Flynn would light you up from inside , just the way he looked at you . Make you feet like you were somebody special . Then suddenly he backs off , blushes and mumbles something and walks away and you 're standing there blinking as if the light has gone  --  where ? Thinking , Next time I wo n't fall for it . Let Darren try ! Next time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting inside girl 's head .
