BOOK 1 Washington , D.C Bad things come in threes . The first bad thing was a voice mail from Cynthia Sunhill , my former partner in the army 's Criminal Investigation Division . Cynthia is still with the CID , and she is also my significant other , though we were having some difficulties with that job description . The message said , " Paul , I need to talk to you . Call me tonight , no matter how late . I just got called on a case , and I have to leave tomorrow morning . We need to talk . " " Okay . " I looked at the mantel clock in my small den . It was just 10 P.M. , or twenty-two hundred hours , as I used to say when I was in the army not so long ago . I live in a stone farmhouse outside Falls Church , Virginia , less than a half-hour drive to CID Headquarters . The commute time is actually irrelevant because I do n't work for the CID any longer . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or maybe fired . In any case , it had been about six months since my separation from the army , and I was getting bored , and I had twenty or thirty years to go . As for Ms. Sunhill , she was stationed at Fort Benning , Georgia , about a fourteen-hour drive from Falls Church , or twelve if I 'm very excited . Her caseload is heavy , and weekends in the army are often normal duty days . The last six months had not been easy on our relatively new relationship , and with her interesting career and my growing addiction to afternoon talk shows , we do n't have a lot to talk about . Anyway , bad thing number two . I checked my e-mail , and there was a message that said simply , 1600 hrs , tomorrow , the Wall . It was signed , K. K is Colonel Karl Hellmann , my former boss at Headquarters , and Cynthia 's present commanding officer . That much was clear . What was n't clear was why Hellmann wanted to meet me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put this under the category of " bad things . " I considered several equally terse replies , none of them very positive . Of course , I did n't have to respond at all ; I was retired . But , in contrast to civilian careers , a military career does not completely end . The expression is , " Once an officer , always an officer . " And I had been a warrant officer by rank , and a criminal investigator by occupation . Fact is , they still have some kind of legal hold on you , though I 'm not really sure what it is . If nothing else , they can screw up your PX privileges for a year . I stared at Karl 's message again and noticed it was addressed to Mr. Brenner . Warrant officers are addressed as Mister , so this salutation was a reminder of my past-or perhaps present-army rank , not a celebration of my civilian status . Karl is not subtle . I held off on my reply . And , last but not least , the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my response to my book club , and in my mail was a Danielle Steel novel . Should I return it ? Or give it to my mother next Christmas ? Maybe she had a birthday coming up . Okay , I could n't postpone the Cynthia call any longer , so I sat at my desk and dialed . I looked out the window as the phone rang at the other end . It was a cold January night in northern Virginia , and a light snow was falling . Cynthia answered , " Hello . " " Hi , " I said . A half-second of silence , then , " Hi , Paul . How are you ? " We were off on the wrong foot already , so I said , " Let 's cut to the chase , Cynthia . " She hesitated , then said , " Well ... Can I first ask you how your day was ? " " I had a great day . An old mess sergeant gave me his recipe for chili-I did n't realize it fed two hundred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziploc bags . I 'll send you some . Then I went to the gym , played a basketball game against a wheelchair team-beat them big time-then off to the local tavern for beer and hamburgers with the boys . How about your day ? " " Well ... I just wrapped up the rape case I told you about . But instead of time off , I have to go to Fort Rucker for a sexual harassment investigation , which looks tricky . I 'll be there until it 's concluded . Maybe a few weeks . I 'll be in Bachelor Officers Quarters if you want to call me . " I did n't reply . She said , " Hey , I still think about Christmas . " " Me , too . " That was a month ago , and I had n't seen her since . " How 's Easter look ? " " You know , Paul ... you could move here . " " But you could be reassigned anytime . Then I 'd wind up following your career moves . Did n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I like it here . You could get stationed here . " " Is that an offer ? " Whoops . I replied , " It would be good for your career . Headquarters . " " Let me worry about my career . And I really do n't want a staff job . I 'm an investigator . Just like you were . I want to go where I can be useful . " I said , " Well , I ca n't be following you around like a puppy dog , or hanging around your apartment when you 're away on assignment . It 's not good for my ego . " " You could get a job here in law enforcement . " " I 'm working on that . Here in Virginia . " And so on . It 's tough when the guy 's not working and the woman has a traveling career . To make matters worse , the army likes to change your permanent duty station as soon as you 're comfortable , which calls into question the army 's definition of permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temporary duty assignments these days-places like Bosnia , Somalia , South America-where you could be gone for up to a year , which pushes the definition of temporary . Bottom line , Cynthia and I were what 's called these days GU-geographically unsuitable . The military , as I 've always said , is tough on relationships ; it 's not a job , it 's a calling , a commitment that makes other commitments really difficult . Sometimes impossible . " Are you there ? " she asked . " I 'm here . " " We ca n't go on like this , Paul . It hurts . " " I know . " " What should we do ? " I think she was willing to resign and forfeit a lot of her pension , in exchange for the M word . Then we 'd decide where to live , find jobs , and live happily ever after . And why not ? We were in love . " Paul ? " " Yeah ... I 'm thinking . " " You should have already thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we should talk about this in person . Face-to-face . " " The only thing we do face-to-face is fuck . " " That 's not ... well , we 'll talk over dinner . In a restaurant . " " Okay . I 'll call you when I get back from Rucker . I 'll come there , or you come here . " " Okay . Hey , how 's your divorce coming ? " " It 's almost final . " " Good . " Regarding her loving husband , I asked , " Do you see much of Major Nut Case ? " " Not much . At the O Club once in a while . Ca n't avoid those situations . " " Does he still want you back ? " " Do n't try to complicate a simple situation . " " I 'm not . I 'm just concerned that he might try to kill me again . " " He never tried to kill you , Paul . " " I must have misinterpreted his reason for pointing a loaded pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure . Hey , do you read Danielle Steel ? " " No , why ? " " I bought her latest book . I 'll send it to you . " " Maybe your mother would like it . It 's her birthday , February 10 . Do n't forget . " " I have it memorized . By the way , I got an e-mail from Karl . He wants to meet me tomorrow . " " Why ? " " I thought maybe you knew . " " No , I do n't , " she said . " Maybe he just wants to have a drink , talk about old times . " " He wants me to meet him at the Vietnam Memorial . " " Really ? That 's odd . " " Yeah . And he never mentioned anything to you ? " " No , " she replied . " Why should he ? " " I do n't know . I ca n't figure out what he 's up to . " " Why do you think he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He likes you . " " No , he does n't , " I said . " He hates me . " " He does not hate you . But you 're a difficult man to work with . Actually , you 're difficult to love . " " My mother loves me . " " You should re-check that . Regarding Karl , he respects you , and he knows just how brilliant you are . He either needs some advice , or he needs some information about an old case . " " Why the Wall ? " " Well ... I do n't know . You 'll find out when you meet him . " " It 's cold here . How 's it there ? " " Sixties . " " It 's snowing here . " " Be careful driving . " " Yeah . " We both stayed silent for a while , during which time I thought of our history . We 'd met at NATO Headquarters in Brussels . She was engaged to Major What's-His-Name , a Special Forces guy , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun on me , I backed off , they got married , and a year later Cynthia and I bumped into each other again . It was in the Officers Club at Fort Hadley , Georgia , and we were both on assignment . I was undercover , investigating the theft and sale of army weapons , she was wrapping up a rape case . That 's her specialty . Sexual crimes . I 'd rather be in combat again than have that job . But someone 's got to do it , and she 's good at it . More important , she can compartmentalize , and she seems to be unaffected by her work , though sometimes I wonder . But back to Fort Hadley , last summer . While we were both there , the post commander 's daughter , Captain Ann Campbell , was found on a rifle range , staked out , naked , strangled , and apparently raped . So , I 'm asked to drop my little arms deal case , and Cynthia is asked to assist me . We solved the murder case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proving more difficult . At least she got rid of Major Nut Job . " Paul , why do n't we put this on hold until we can meet ? Is that okay ? " " Sounds okay . " In fact , it was my suggestion . But why point that out ? " Good idea . " " We both need to think about how much we have to give up and how much we stand to gain . " " Did you rehearse that line ? " " Yes . But it 's true . Look , I love you- " " And I love you . " " I know . That 's why this is difficult . " Neither of us spoke for a while , then she said , " I 'm younger than you --  " " But I 'm more immature . " " Please shut up . And I like what I do , I like my life , my career , my independence . But ... I 'd give it up if I thought ... " " I hear you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not pressuring you , Paul . I 'm not even sure I want what I think I want . " I 'm a bright guy , but I get confused when I talk to women . Rather than ask for a clarification , I said , " I understand . " " Do you ? " " Absolutely . " " Totally clueless . " " Do you miss me ? " " Every day , " I said . " I miss you . I really do . I 'm looking forward to seeing you again . I 'll take some leave time . I promise . " " I 'll take some leave time , too . " " You 're not working . " " Right . But if I was , I 'd take a leave to be with you . I 'll come to you this time . It 's warmer there . " " Okay . That would be nice . " " You like chili ? " " No . " " I thought you liked chili . Okay , good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll be there . " " It 'll be about two weeks . Maybe three . I 'll let you know when I get into the case . " " Okay . " " Say hello to Karl for me . Let me know what he wanted . " " Maybe he wants to tell me about his alien abduction . " She laughed . So , just as we were about to end on a happy note , she said , " You know , Paul , you did n't have to resign . " " Is that a fact ? " The case of the general 's daughter had been trouble from minute one , a political , emotional , and professional minefield , and I stepped right into it . I would have been better off not solving the case because the solution turned out to be about things no one wanted to know . I said to Cynthia , " A letter of reprimand in my file is the army 's way of saying , ' Call your pension officer . ' A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misinterpreted what was happening . You were scolded , you got all huffy , and you acted impulsively because your ego was bruised . " " Is that so ? Well , thank you for informing me that I threw away a thirty-year career because I had a temper tantrum . " " You should come to terms with that . I 'll tell you something else-unless you find something equally important and challenging to do , you 're going to get depressed --  " " I 'm depressed now . You just made me depressed . Thanks . " " Sorry , but I know you . You were not as burned out as you thought you were . The Campbell case just got to you . That 's okay . It got to everyone . Even me . It was the saddest , most depressing case --  " " I do n't want to talk about that . " " Okay . But what you needed was a thirty-day leave , not a permanent vacation . You 're still young- " " You 're younger . " " You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you need to write a second act , Paul . " " Thank you . I 'm exploring my options . " It had gotten noticeably cooler in the room and on the phone . " Are you angry ? " " No . If you were here , you 'd see me smiling . I 'm smiling . " " Well , if I did n't love you , I would n't be saying these things . " " I 'm still smiling . " " See you in a few weeks . " She said , " Take care of yourself . " " You , too . " Silence , then , " Good night . " " ' Bye . " We both hung up . I stood , went to the bar , and made a drink . Scotch , splash of soda , ice . I sat in my den , my feet on the desk , watching the snow outside . The Scotch smelled good . So , there I was with a Danielle Steel novel on my desk , an unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominous message from Karl Hellmann on my computer screen . Sometimes things that seem unconnected are actually part of a larger plan . Not your plan , to be sure , but someone else 's plan . I was supposed to believe that Karl and Cynthia were not talking about me , but Mrs. Brenner did n't raise an idiot . I should be pissed off when people underestimate my intelligence , though in truth , I affect a certain macho idiocy that encourages people to underestimate my brilliance . I 've put a lot of people in jail that way . I looked at the message again . 1600 hrs , tomorrow , the Wall . Not even " please . " Colonel Karl Gustav Hellmann can be a bit arrogant . He 's German-born , as the name suggests , whereas Paul Xavier Brenner is a typical Irish lad , from South Boston , charmingly irresponsible , and delightfully smart-assed . Herr Hellmann is quite the opposite . Yet , on some strange level , we got along . He was a good commander , strict but fair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , I sat up and banged out an e-mail to Karl : See you there and then . I signed it , Paul Brenner , PFC , which , in this case , did not mean Private First Class , but meant , as Karl and I both knew , Private F-ing Civilian .
