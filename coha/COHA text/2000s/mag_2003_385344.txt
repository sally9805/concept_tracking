There 's a secret weapon to help keep your kids slim in a supersize world : YOU <p> MY 6-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER has the appetite of a truck driver on a grapefruit diet . Much to many a mother 's envy , she 's piling round two on her plate while other kids are picking at their chicken and potatoes . I watch . She moves on to dessert and devours a big dish of ice cream . I worry . Although I try not to let the F-word puncture her psyche too prematurely , I ca n't help but fear that if she keeps eating like this , she 'll end up getting F-A-T . <p> And there 's good reason for my fear . The incidence of childhood obesity has tripled in the past 2 decades . Some 15% of school-age children weigh more than they should , leading to a variety of serious health consequences such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension . Even some toddlers ( ages 2 to 5 ) are obese and showing signs of disease . There are emotional consequences too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association reported that obese children and teens suffer so much emotionally and socially that their quality of life compares with that of childhood cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . Overweight kids may also turn into chronic dieters or develop eating disorders . <p> Yet watching a child 's weight can be tricky business , says Leann Birch , PhD , distinguished professor of human development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University . For more than 25 years , Birch has been studying why kids eat the way they do and how they develop weight and eating problems . Here 's one of the things she 's found : Unwittingly , parents  --  through how they act , what they say , and even their own diet struggles  --  can subvert their own good intentions . <p> In ongoing research , Birch has found that overweight girls as young as 5 whose mothers tried hardest to control what and how much their children ate ended up feeling worse about themselves than other children  --  and they tended to be even more overweight . <p> I wondered whether my daughter could detect my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I raise an eyebrow when she takes a third hefty helping of pasta , toss her party bags filled with Gummi Bears and M &M's,; or deny her requests for supersize bags of chips . Memories of teenage crash diets , borderline bulimic and anorexic friends , and struggles with my own body image come hurtling back to me . I worry whether my daughter is destined to become another female beleaguered by food and weight issues . <p> How do you keep your children from falling victim to this fate and help them to stay healthy , confident  --  and slender  --  at the same time ? Give Kids a Chance <p> In today 's environment , where caloric , high-fat foods are often cheaper and easier to get than healthier options , parents need to mediate between the environment and the child " by setting some limits , providing some options , and giving kids lots of opportunities to learn to like those things that are really good for them , " Birch says . <p> An underlying problem is eating when we 're not hungry . We eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiramisu is irresistible , or simply because " it 's time . " Infants and young children , on the other hand , tend to eat only when they 're hungry and stop when they 're full . <p> A 3-year-old , for instance , can be so precise in self-regulating that if she drinks a 100-calorie beverage before dinner , she may actually eat 100 calories less at the next meal . But as early as age 5 , kids become " much more tuned in to the environmental cues that trigger eating , " Birch says . " So if the food is there , or if they see someone else eating , they may be more inclined to eat , even if they 're not particularly hungry . " Before long , a child 's physical feeling of hunger Surrenders to more overpowering forces , and the potential for gaining weight and eating problems begins . <p> All parents  --  but particularly mothers  --  make decisions from very early in their children 's lives about what and how to feed them . They decide whether to use formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , they pressure kids to clean their plates or stop them from eating a bag of cheese puffs before dinner . They set examples for their children about food and eating that they may not even realize . For example , last year a Penn State study found that girls who do n't like to try new foods are likely to have moms who do n't eat a wide variety of foods , especially vegetables . All of this has a profound and potentially lasting impact on what our children eat and how they deal with food  --  and even on how overweight they become . Try It , They 'll Like It <p> One of the earliest and most important jobs parents have is exposing children to a variety of foods . " If children grow up in a family where they 've never been served broccoli , they 're not going to be likely to eat it , " says Birch . The more variety kids have in their diets , the greater the odds that they might choose grilled salmon over macaroni-and-cheese . Children have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are depends heavily on their parents . <p> Most of us have witnessed the yellow squash oozing back out of a child 's mouth after one taste . In general , kids reject unfamiliar or new foods . " If you want your children to accept a variety of foods , you have to offer them , and you have to offer them repeatedly , " Birch says . For vegetables and other foods that are n't sweet , her research has shown that this may require feeding kids the same food 5 , 10 , or as many as 15 times before they like it . Put the broccoli or peas on the plate , but do n't force them to eat it . Pressuring kids to eat certain foods can lead them to avoid and dislike them . Serve Kiddie Portions <p> Research at the University of North Carolina found that Americans are supersizing at home : Between 1977 and 1996 , portion size for some junk foods jumped by about 100 calories or more . So it should come as no surprise that parents often inadvertently serve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than they need . Another study revealed that younger kids eat according to whether they 're hungry or not , regardless of how much food is on their plate . But for kids over age 5 , as the portion size got larger , so did the amount they ate . <p> Another problem with feeding kids oversize portions is that it leads to pressure at the dinner table . This sends the message to the child not to trust her own hunger cues , but to eat because the food is on the plate and her parents  --  not she  --  know how much is enough . <p> A good rule to follow for preschoolers is that they only need 1 tablespoon of any given food for every year of age . Two tablespoons of peas for a 2-year-old does n't sound like a lot , but it 's plenty . One of the best ways to bring down portion size , Birch says , is to serve dinner family style by placing the pasta and vegetables in bowls or platters with serving spoons , and let kids serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking more age-appropriate portions instead of the inflated , oversize ones parents and restaurants pile on . Plus , says Birch , " kids , particularly preschoolers , really like being independent . " Let Them Eat Junk <p> Forget forbidden foods . Kids need to have some control over what they eat . They know that double-fudge cookies exist , and if they have no control over getting them , the sweets will seem as irresistible as the apple in the Garden of Eden . <p> Several of Birch 's studies have revealed that girls whose mothers tried to control their eating or restrict their access to sweets and snacks ate more when they were n't hungry , chose to eat the forbidden foods whenever possible , tended to be heavier , suffered from guilt , felt bad about their body , and saw themselves as being inferior physically and intellectually . " Parents can end up creating the same problems in their children that they 're trying to prevent , " she says . <p> Birch saw it firsthand , right in her own home . When two new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the family snack cupboard  --  which she had always kept accessible and filled with a variety of cookies , chips , and the like  --  was empty within a few days . She soon discovered that the new girls were the culprits . " They were in a home environment that was very , very restricted . And they would come over and either pig out or fill their pockets or both . " <p> Kids need to know how to fit fattening foods into their healthy diets , says Birch . " In a healthy diet , there 's a place for a Ho Ho or a Ding Dong once in a while . " If your child eats too much candy or chips , do n't buy them , or buy smaller quantities . And when they 're gone , they 're gone . Lessons Learned <p> I 've been trying to take all of this common sense and feeding wisdom and apply it to my young hearty eater . At a recent birthday party , I watched my daughter twirl her tongue around a white paper wand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake ) , and I wondered what the now food-wise mother in me should do . I knew that taking it away would backfire , but it took all my effort to prevent my disapproving , diet-conscious eye from glaring at her , grabbing the sticky pink mass , and shoving a dish of baby carrots into her hands . <p> I did none of this . Instead , I turned away and chatted with a friend , feeling a sense of futility about how to effect any real change . <p> And then : " Mom ? " I turned around to find my daughter holding her cotton stick , still full . Then , like a gift , she held it out to me and said something that made me realize that , although making positive changes in eating practices may not transform our attitudes and bodies overnight , it 's a process that for us was well underway . " Will you take the rest of this ? " she said , her candy-filled hand outstretched . " I 'm not hungry anymore .

So the earlier you start , the better . But here are some tips , based on research by Leann Birch , PhD , for raising healthy , slim eaters no matter how old your kids are . <p> Be a good role model Pressuring kids to eat their vegetables is not nearly as effective as eating them yourself . This goes for everything parents do , from eating healthy foods and staying active ( do ) to snacking in front of the TV ( do n't ) . Mothers are especially important models of healthy eating for their daughters . <p> Watch how you watch your weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight issues , along with their body satisfaction . Birch found that mothers who are overly concerned with their body image and weight have daughters who tend to do the same thing , even at the age of 5 . If you 're a mother , it 's best to do any weight watching behind the scenes . <p> Do n't reward with food " Foods that are used as rewards will become more preferred , and typically they 're foods that tend to be high in sugar or salt , " Birch explains . She suggests using inedible rewards instead , such as praise , an outing , or time with parents . <p> Wait on dessert If you must serve something sweet , do so later in the evening , so it 's not part of the meal . This way , getting dessert is n't connected to what a child has eaten for dinner . Instead of being a reward , it becomes a " sometimes " treat . <p> Make the TV room a no-food zone In a Tufts University study , researchers linked overweight children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  although that 's part of it  --  but because of the high-calorie snacks they tend to eat while watching . When watching TV becomes a normal part of meal routines , families consume fewer fruits and vegetables and more pizza , snack foods , and soda . <p>
