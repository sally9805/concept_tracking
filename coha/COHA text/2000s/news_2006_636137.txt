<p> The corporate executives at both the Chicago office and the West Coast headquarters of the country 's largest concert promoter are n't talking , and neither are local employees at one of the city 's best music clubs . But the recent news that Live Nation has purchased the national House of Blues chain for $350 million in cash , including the landmark club just north of the Loop , has left music fans wondering what it means for them . <p> Not surprisingly , one veteran Chicago promoter , Jam Productions co-founder Jerry Mickelson , sees trouble . <p> " I think it 's bad for the consumer and bad for those of us who are in the live entertainment industry , because one more competitor has just been eliminated by Live Nation , " he says . " It 's not a healthy thing : Competition is good , but the way the concert industry is going , pretty soon , they 'll be only one company . " <p> Indeed , the thriving Chicago concert market is unique among most major cities in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as SFX Entertainment ( before being bought by Clear Channel , then recently spinning off as a separate publicly traded company ) , Live Nation set out to create a giant national monopoly , spending billions of dollars buying up regional concert promoters . <p> " Jam is probably the biggest of the local promoters that did n't get bought out , which makes Chicago different than most of the other markets , " says Gary Bongiovanni , editor of the concert trade publication Pollstar . " In Cleveland , Belkin sold ; Bill Graham sold in San Francisco ; Delsener-Slater sold in New York ; the Electric Factory sold in Philadelphia . They all became a part of this larger company , where Jam hung in there as one of the last of the independents . " <p> Last year , Jam won a $90 million verdict against Clear Channel in a highly publicized antitrust suit involving motor sports , after testimony that included Clear Channel executives boasting that they 'd love to " crush , kill and destroy " Jam . The verdict was overturned on appeal , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could bring its case back to court . ( Neither side will comment on the amount . ) <p> Live Nation and Jam now fight a pitched battle over which company gets the biggest piece of the local concert pie . Live Nation owns the First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in Tinley Park and the Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy , Wis. , and it controls the new Charter One Pavilion on Northerly Island . Jam owns and operates the Park West and the Vic Theatre , and it regularly promotes shows at other venues including the Riviera , the Aragon and the Auditorium Theatre . <p> The two rivals duke it out to promote the biggest national tours at venues such as the Allstate Arena and the United Center , with Live Nation often winning the top-dollar superstar packages such as Madonna and Paul McCartney  --  which have seen top ticket prices nearing $400  --  and Jam promoting more independent-minded , less bottom-line obsessed acts such as Pearl Jam , Widespread Panic and the Foo Fighters . <p> It 's fair to say that Live Nation dominates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of 1,000-seat clubs to 4,500-seat theaters . Live Nation has long sought to secure a large club or small theater of its own to compete with Jam at that level  --  the idea is that acts that start out in clubs eventually make it to stadiums , and Live Nation does n't want to cede a single ticket dollar along the way  --  but it was frustrated in its earlier attempts to buy the Vic or turn the Congress Theatre into a viable venue . Now , with the purchase of House of Blues , Live Nation has the club it has long been seeking . <p> Local Live Nation vice president Scott Gelman declined to comment for this story , as did company spokesman John Vlautin , but back in 2002 , when rumors first surfaced that his company was trying to buy the House of Blues , Gelman told me : " If I had a 1,000- or 1,400-seat legitimate city of Chicago venue , I 'd be a happy camper . I need that small venue . Jam 's been in the market for almost 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venues in the marketplace . The House of Blues is their competitor , and they 're beating the crap out of each other at the club level . " <p> Chicago 's House of Blues was one of the chain 's most successful venues , and its secret weapon was local talent buyer Michael Yerke , who cut his teeth as an arch-competitor to Jam at clubs such as the Cubby Bear , back when Jam was the 800-pound gorilla and local monopoly , before the 10,000-pound elephant of Live Nation came along . Seeing parts of the music community that Jam was n't servicing , Yerke turned the House of Blues into the premier local venue for hip-hop , worldbeat and extreme metal , making the club a vital part of the local music scene . <p> For Chicago concert-goers , the first and most obvious impact of the latest mega-deals and corporate machinations involves the future of Yerke and his crack staff at the local House of Blues , who also declined to comment here . <p> " If Live Nation gets rid of Michael Yerke , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the concert industry 's most knowledgeable independent observers . " Live Nation has made the decision that they are going to keep the House of Blues brand name on the clubs , and Chicago is a very successful venue . It really would be foolish for them to get rid of the people who are really good at their jobs . When you buy a company , you do n't want to fire the best people . I 'm sure Michael , like everyone else , is wondering , ' What 's this going to mean for me ? ' But I 'd be hard-pressed to figure that they would get rid of him . " <p> The other impact this deal will have on local music fans is less immediate and harder to gauge , since it involves much bigger questions about whether the consumer ever really benefits when one company  --  be it Starbucks , Microsoft or Live Nation  --  dominates a market at the expense of smaller or local business , whether it 's the mom-and-pop coffee shop , Apple Computers or Jam . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one significant No. 2 "  --  national promoter the Anschutz Entertainment Group , which had been vying with House of Blues for the No. 2 slot , though both shared a fraction of the market enjoyed by Live Nation  --  " and then a pretty big drop-off before you get down to the level of Jam , " Bongiovanni says . The biggest positive of this new Live Nation nation is convenience for superstar acts . " They are a huge , one-stop company , where if you just want to deal with one person , they can put together a tour for you end to end . " But any company that large is inherently conservative . " With bigness comes a loss of street sense . The independents have always seemed to have an advantage in that they are more on top of new trends . " <p> Then there is the matter of ticket prices . After leveling off for a year or so following a sharp downturn in attendance in 2004 , the cost of tickets has once again been rising steadily since the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concert business gets smaller and smaller , the consumer is hurt more and more , " Jam 's Mickelson maintains . " The fewer choices we have , the worse it is in any segment of our lives . It 's true of phones , computers , refuse removal or concerts . The consolidation of almost everything we see today is costing us more . Just tell me when you 've ever seen big business make anything cost less .
