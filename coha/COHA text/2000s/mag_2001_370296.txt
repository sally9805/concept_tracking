As a single woman in my 30s , I 'm naturally terrified of children . I mean , what do I do with them ? How do I get them to do what I say ? Will they even like me ? To help answer these questions and that other great mystery of postmodern life  --  why kids are so mesmerized by video games  --  I arranged a little experiment . First I finagled four of the new Game Boy Advance handhelds ( $100 successors to Game Boy Color with a larger screen , faster processor and better colors and sound ) that Nintendo will release in the U.S. on June 11 . Next I ordered a bunch of new games designed for the Advance . Then I loaded my backpack full of goodies and set out to meet the kids . <P> First up were three first-graders . Unfortunately , their favorite game is Pokemon , and there wo n't be an Advance version until sometime next year . Duh . I did , however , manage to tempt them with Activision 's Pinobee , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest collecting flowers , meeting fairies and dodging funny-looking bad guys . " I 'm good at this ! " yelled Lucas . The seven-year-olds were less impressed with Nintendo 's racer , F-Zero . " This game is impossible , " said Jonathan in disgust . <P> I had tried a little F-Zero myself before I met the boys , so I was more than a bit relieved that I was not the only one who kept crashing and burning . On the basis of Lucas ' big endorsement , however , I gave Pinobee a shot when I got home that night . I was pretty good at it too . It took me hours to psyched myself up to charm a group of five bigger kids , ages 8 to 13 , including one boy who could barely look at me . Uh-oh . What 's more , the badly illuminated room we were sitting in underscored Advance 's biggest flaw : the screen is not lighted . Sure , you can buy an external light ( Nyko 's Worm Light is $10 ) , but you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jokim volunteered that with Advance , " you move quicker and you can jump higher . It looks like a TV . " Rea fell for Ubi Soft 's Rayman , which is similar to Pinobee . " It 's hot ! " she said . " It looks like the sky is moving . " <P> Finally , I tested Advance 's multiplayer features , which let you link as many as four players at once , by encouraging three brothers , ages 8 to 10 , to duke it out . " I like the bigger screen because you can see where you 're going , " said the oldest , Victor . Kyle especially liked Atlus ' Super Dodge Ball Advance . " When you hit the ball , it can go high . " But Andre had some issues with Bam ! Entertainment 's Fire Pro Wrestling . " You ca n't grapple , " he complained , " and the person I 'm playing against always wins . " <P> I can definitely relate . I hate losing too . And it occurred to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And maybe , just maybe , this Game Boy craze is n't so dumb . In Konami 's Krazy Racers , you can race in space or on the beach . You can drop off a cloud and drive in a lake . It 's silly and fun and makes the impossible possible  --  nothing scary about it . <P> For more on Advance and its accessories , visit
