" The tenement is the basic facade in New York , the face of the slums , a slab of tombstone propertions , four to six stories pooded by windows . " 1 Since the mid-nineteenth century successive waves of American immigrants have made their homes in the crowded , dimly lit , and poorly ventilated tenements of New York City 's Lower East Side . The Lower East Side Tenement Museum is housed in one such building , at 97 Orchard Street . In contrast to many historic buildings that commemorate their famous former inhabitants or are noted for exemplary architecture and fine decorations , the museum is in a once ordinary , pre-regulation tenement that now interprets the city 's workingclass mid immigrant history from 1863 to the Great Depression .

It encourages visitors to think critically about the past and present rather than wrap themselves in patriotism . As part of its mission the museum seeks to promote tolerance and provide historical perspective on immigration in New York City . Situated in a rapidly changing neighborhood that is still home to tenements , the museum disproves the myth that upward mobility is the fluid experience often pointed to in tales of immigrant success .

The maintenance of a hygienic household was of the utmost concern to reformers at such institutions as the Educational Alliance and the Henry Street Settlement , where Lillian D. Wald 's ( 1867-1940 ) model tenement , known as the Flat , schooled newly arrived women in proper American decor and cleaning hearth and home.6 Reformers lectured the immigrants against decorating their walls with cheap ethnic calendars , wedding photographs , or knickknacks from home .

( 8 ) The immigrant families were distinguished by their ethnic origins , race , and religion . Visitors to the museum learn about their world mainly through the experience of the women . The histories of working-class women and children differed from those of men and boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history is shaped by a totality of experiences , including work and home , mothering and child-rearing family relations , community activities , shopping , leisure , and recreation-in short , all the details and rhythms of everyday life.9 The lives of the women in these families revolved around the maintenance of daily life . They depended on each other to help with child rearing and household tasks , and they provided a safety net for each other when difficulties arose.10 Hanging wash together and socializing on the rooftops of the tenements as romanticized by John Sloan ( Pl .

Addison Gallery of American Art , Phillips Academy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the museum is to explore New York City 's multiethnic working-class and immigrant past . Beginning in the 1820s , lower Manhattan 's Tenth Ward , which included Orchard Street , 12 was composed of dirt streets and ramshackle buildings in which lived American-born whites , recently arrived Irish , and a small number of free African Americans , some of whom had formerly been Slaves.13 With the arrival of new immigrants in the region in the 1830s , speculators began to put up frame tenements , which were cheap , quickly built , and the first rental buildings in the United States erected specifically to house more than one family.14 During the 1850s these early buildings were razed and replaced by large numbers of brick and stone multilevel tenements . However , in the Tenth Ward frame buildings still outnumbered those of masonry . In 1856 the Tenement House Committee of the New York State legislature condemned housing in the Tenth Ward for " dirty conditions without ventilation and without room sufficient for civilized existence . " 15 Built in 1863 , the tenement at 97 Orchard Street was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick building with modest Italianate decoration that contains twenty three-room apartments.16 Originally , the building housed a tavern in the basement , a store on the ground floor , and , years later , at least three sweatshops , one of which the museum is currently re-creating . Typical of the worst early tenements , 97 Orchard Street was not fireproof , lacked fire escapes , running water , sanitary facilities , fighting , and gas . Only one room per apartment received direct sunlight . It is estimated that between 71 and 110 people lived in the building at any one time with a high turnover of occupancy Between 1863 and 1935 approximately 7,000 people from twenty countries called this building home.17 In 1867 the first Tenement House Act was drafted with the aim of improving the deplorable state of housing in New York City Yet because the document was full of loopholes and not enough money was allotted to enforce it , the act amounted to little more than hopeful suggestions . Moreover , 97 Orchard Street predated the act and so lacked even the minimal amenities that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its first landlord , who owned the building until 1886 , was Lucas Glockner ( 1820-1891 ) , a German immigrant tailor.18 Between 1845 and 1864 German immigrants arrived in New York City in large numbers and transformed the Tenth Ward and the Lower East Side into Kleindeutschland , the first of the giant urban settlements of nonEnglish speakers that typified American cities by the end of the nineteenth century.19 Between 1880 and 1919 more than twenty-three million people immigrated to the United States , representing more than one-third of the nation 's population increase during those years.20 Of these immigrants , seventeen million settled in New York City.21 Two-think of the nation 's imports came through New York harbor and the city was rich in industry and retail trade , depending for its prosperity on cheap labor and an immigrant workforce . Because of its close proximity to work , immigrants settled on the Lower East Side , forming ethnic enclaves . Soon after the successive waves of European immigrants , a great migration of blacks took place from the rural South to the urban North . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than three hundred thousand people to New York City , Detroit , and Chicago , where most settled in tenements.22 Jewish immigrants such as the Confino , Gumpertz , and Rogarshevsky families of 97 Orchard Street , brought with them a greater experience in urban living than some other immigrant groups . They came over as families and were prepared to settle for good in the United States . Many Eastern European Jews were fleeing religious and political persecution , which made permanent settlement necessary However , despite the policy of open immigration for Europeans , 23 which was ended by the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 , immigrants were not warmly welcomed , as illustrated by Woodrow Wilson 's assessment in 1902 : The immigrant newcomers of recent years are men of the lowest class from the South of Italy , and men of the meaner sort out of Hungary and Poland , men out of the ranks where there was neither skill nor energy nor any initiative of quick intelligence.24 The oldest historical re-creation in the museum is that of the German-Jewish Gumpertz family apartment during the late 1870s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pls .

Several objects convey the family 's ethnic identity and occupation . Nathalie would have lit the simple brass candlesticks on the mantel for the Friday night Sabbath , and at the Singer sewing machine she pursued her livelihood as a dressmaker ( see Pl . I ) . The sparsely decorated apartment would originally have contained inexpensive mass-produced furniture of the kind sold in local second-hand shops or through catalogues such as Montgomery Wards . Still , immigrant families did their best to beautify their surroundings . Lace curtains framed the apartment 's only windows , and conservators have discovered multiple layers of floral wallpaper on the walls of this apartment , despite the admonitions of reformers . Steve Long , the curator of the museum , has suggested that perhaps Frederick Linder , a painter and paperhanger who lived at 97 Orchard Street , papered the walls in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Scalamandre as " Orchard Street " papers in their portfolio of historic papers .

On October 7 , 1874 , her husband , Julius , failed to return from work-not the only husband to disappear . In fact , for years the New York Jewish daily Forward published what it called " The Gallery of Missing Husbands , " with photographs of vanished husbands and pleas to return by their deserted wives.26 To support their families , women would bring in piecework from garment factories , make paper flowers to sell , and take in boarders . As many as eighteen people would live in one of these small three-room apartments , often sleeping , eating , and living in shifts . The Rogarshevsky boys , for example , slept four across the family couch , their legs supported by chairs . One elderly man recalled his recurrent childhood fear that he would return from school to discover that his cot in the dining room was once again occupied by a relative just off the boat from Europe.27 In the 1870s , existing and new tenements began to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transoms were cut above the doors of inner rooms to permit a better flow of air in existing buildings , and the new tenements were dumbbell shaped , providing an airshaft at the core of the building ( see Pl . VIII ) for the same reason . Unfortunately , these shafts often became the depository for kitchen and chamber pot waste.28 Greatly increased immigration in the 1880s resulted in the construction of even more substandard tenements . Jacob A. Riis 's expose How the Other Half Lives of 1890 revealed the conditions in downtown tenements , which he also presented in public lectures urging reform ( see Fig. 1 ) . To Riis and other reformers the immigrants and the slums were the antithesis of middle-class morals , stability , and home life . Riis appealed to the Christian conscience of the middle class and elected officials to provide charity and assist the " slum dwellers . " 29 The Tenement House Exhibition held in 1899 and 1900 in New York City led to new building codes and the creation of new building types . The organizer of the exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stated that his goal was to prove to the community the fact that in New York City the working-man is housed worse than in any other city in the civilized world , notwithstanding the fact that he pays more for such accommodation than is paid anywhere else.30 Provisions that Willer promoted , and that were introduced into the 1901 building codes , included mandatory running water on each floor at least one indoor toilet for every two families , and the installation of windows in the interior rooms to provide for airflow.31 In 1905 , the architect Otto Reissmann bought 97 Orchard Street and included these improvements when he brought the building up to code.32 However , the basic premise of tenement living remained constant : to house the greatest number of people while providing the fewest number of amenities .

Actresses and members of the education staff take turns portraying Victoria Confino at the age of fourteen , just after she left school to work in her father 's factory and help provide for the family of ten who lived in their three-room apartment ( see Pls . VII and IX ) . As " Victoria " talks about tenement life , hidden speakers bring sounds from the historic Lower East Side into the apartment-the elevated train that once ran above Allen Street , the clattering of horse-drawn carts , and charter in Judeo-Spanish , or Ladino , the language of the Sephardim . She shows the children the boolemas , or special pan , in which her mother cooked Sephardic Passover treats.33 Visiting children are allowed to handle the manta , the thick , ruby  --  colored goat-fur Turkish rug used for sleeping ( which actually belonged to the Confinos ) . The apartment , where each room served many functions for many people , has only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorations the Confinos made the apartment a home . When meeting " Victoria " and learning about Sephardic culture , today 's schoolchildren discuss conflicting ideas of home , ritual , and tradition . By contrast , when Victoria was alive , teachers would have taught her to memorize facts rather than question or explore them , and to leave traditional ways behind in deference to the American way . The most recent re-creation at the museum is the apartment of the Rogarshevskys , the Eastern European Jewish family with six young children and a boarder who lived in a three-room apartment at 97 Orchard Street beginning in 1910 ( see Pls . X and XI ) . The interpretation concerns the relationship of disease , poverty and poor housing because the time is July 1918 , when Abraham Rogarshevsky the father succumbed to tuberculosis . His widow , Fannie , became the building 's janitor in order to support her family The apartment is arranged to indicate Abraham 's recent death and the family 's observation of shivah , the Jewish period of mourning .

XI ) . In order to discover the details of working-class life , " the decorative arts history that nobody knows , " as the consulting curator Pamela Keech called it , she reviewed photographs of crime scenes . Unlike posed family photographs or those staged by reformers , the crime scenes reveal a truer sense of how tenements were arranged and decorated.34 The Baldizzi family from Palermo , Sicily , lived at 97 Orchard Street during the late 1920s and into the Great Depression , when Josephine Baldizzi was between the ages of two and nine . Between 1860 and 1880 agricultural failures caused more than 65,000 Italians to leave for the United States.35 By 1900 this exodus swelled to 145,000 . In general , the Italian influx was composed less of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of sending money home and of returning to Italy when possible.36 When whole Italian families immigrated , the women were reluctant to leave home to work in the factories , and their husbands forbade them to become domestics . Thus , Italian women supplemented the family income by taking in boarders and doing piecework alongside their daughters.37 Girls like Josephine Baldizzi ( 1924-1998 ) would stay with their mother listening to the radio or reading the newspaper rather than joining their brothers playing games in the streets.38 As an adult , Josephine Bald= Esposito provided the museums staff with rich memories of her life on Orchard Street , where she shared a small folding cot with her brother Johnny in a room measuring eight by six feet ( see Pl . VIII ) and helped her mother with the chores . She and her brother acted out small plays together , sometimes standing on the trunk that was one of the few pieces of ft=ture the Baldizzis owned . Sometimes , she had the honor of turning on the Sabbath lights for her neighbors , the Rogarshevskys , who by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated to the museum many objects that had belonged to her family ranging from tablecloths , table runners , and bedspreads , to a colander and a baking pan . The Baldizzi apartment offers evidence of the family 's religious faith , political convictions , and ties to Italy . On a wooden bureau are the family prayer book brought from Sicily and rosary beads , while nearby is a photograph of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ( see Pl . MI ) . The Baldizzis were hard hit by the Great Depression , but they had great faith in Roosevelt and the New Deal . As is the Rogarshevskys ' , the Baldizzis ' apartment is arranged to narrate a pivotal event in the family 's life . Their modest belongings , including the parents ' bed , are packed and ready for their move , for they were evicted in 1935 ( see Pl . XII ) . Rather than make the necessary improvements and renovations , the landlord evicted all tenants that year , and the building became a storage facility until well into the 1980s , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance conflicting visions and needs of the Lower East Side from the point of view of tourists and residents . Schoolchildren learn about the cultural and immigration history of the Lower East Side . The museum works with cultural groups , immigrant and labor organizations , presents exhibitions of works by contemporary artists , and runs courses in English as a second language using the techniques of oral history . In addition , the museum plans to create more interpretive rooms . Under consideration are the apartments of an Irish-American family and a Puerto Rican family , to introduce the history of the Loisada ( the Puerto Rican section of the Lower East Side ) ; 39 a palmistry studio ; and a saloon , all of which were once housed at 97 Orchard Street . By focusing on the working classes , labor , immigration , and the lives of women , the museum has successfully expanded the historical record to present a more inclusive and truthful picture of life in New York City .
