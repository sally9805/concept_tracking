Meet 10 urban places that do cycling right-population , sprawl and congestion be damned ! // IN A WORLD CLOSER TO PERFECT THAN THIS ONE , we all pedal to work because it 's the easiest thing to do . We share the streets freely and respectfully with cars and enjoy endless , bike  --  specific paths that spread from downtown to backcountry and back a thousand ways . We play , too , of course-romping over high mountain passes , in deep woods , on singletrack , road-race courses , dedicated crit loops . We gather at local festivals , neighborhood rides that attract thousands ( or tens of thousands ) , co-op wrenching stations , wellstocked shops and coffee shops with racks . An army of local officials works tirelessly to make the region even better for bikes . They use our opinions ( and tax money ) to create paths and bridges and racks and more . This is the place in a story like this where we say there is no such place . But guess what ? There is . And others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check back with one of our all-time most-popular features-BICYCLING 's Best Cycling Cities awards . Launched in 1990 , updated in 1995 and again in ' 99 , our designation of the top cities for cycling receives more acclaim , argument and just plain attention than anything else we do . Cyclists care . Governments care . Other media care . We get letters , threats , backslaps and finger-wagging from readers . Winning mayors invite us to their cities ( and losing mayors appoint special commissions to improve their city 's standing ) . TV stations , morning shows , radio talkfests and newspapers such as USA Today and the Wall StreetJournal have covered our rankings in the past . We base ratings on cycling infrastructure ( bike lanes , bike racks , access to bridges and public transportation ) , the advocacy climate ( local non-governmental groups as well as public bicycle coordinators or other officials with bicycle affinities ) , and bike culture . That last is tough to quantify-so we solicited judgments from local cycling experts , non-paid advocates , club leaders , shop owners and everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we broke our rankings into three categories : Population of 200,000 to 500,000 500,000 to 1 million 1 million or more We also selected one city as best overall-our top honor regardless of population . If your city is n't on the list-or if it 's named to our Worst Cycling Cities list-it 's time to get angry . And loud . And organized . Still smarting from being named one of our worst cycling cities in ' 90 , Orlando , Florida , invited us to the ribbon-cutting of its newest bike path last year-part of the city 's commendable push to make local cycling safer , easier and more fun . Other shunned-or designated-worst-cities have hired new bike coordinators , earmarked funds for cycling projects for the first time , and helped local grass-roots groups get organized . #1 PORTLAND , OR Why It 's Our Top Pick : Bike policies hat are years-or even decades-ahead if most other cities Regional antisprawl measures that do n't imprison city cyclists within strip-mall suburbs O Lots of non-cyclists who ride bikes Space for Us : The stats are beyond impressive : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years , bringing its totals to 142 miles of bike lanes , 26 miles of bike boulevards and 53 miles of paths . Another 58 miles is funded and in the works . While other places are trying to get a few stripes painted on roads , Portland is optimizing bike routes . Recent bikeway additions were targeted to provide new access into North Portland ( a large , primarily residential area ) , and into three commercial areas of the city . Each year , $100,000 is spent for " missing links " connecting the bike network in places that were too difficult to implement when a project was installed . Example : a new , 2-mile section that connects existing paths between the central city and the Sellwood neighborhood . Portland now has so many bikeways that it 's starting a signing/mapping project to help riders navigate the system ( based on Vancouver 's system ) . Best Newbie Sightings : Led by bike planners like Roger Geller , the city 's bicycle coordinator , more than 40 traffic engineers , planners and managers have ridden the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-speed bikes that are part of Portland 's vehicle fleet . Then there are the Summer Cycle rides-spandex-free rides that tour the city four times a week and are aimed towards teaching those new to cycling how to get around Portland by bike . Non-Bike Development That We Love : How 's this for progressive transportation policy : Some downtown streets were designated as skating/skateboard routes . " It reflects the city council 's attitude that the streets are for everyone , " says Geller . Police opposed the plan , but enough citizens were using those little , hard wheels to get around to convince the decision makers . Biggest Chunk of Change for Bikes : $34 million for the new Eastside Esplanade . It includes a cantilevered bike/pedestrian path hanging off the lower deck of the Steel Bridge-previously , cyclists had to either elbow cars on the narrow roadway or elbow walkers on the narrow sidewalk . Smart Growth : The area is growing , but the land around the city is n't being turned into suburban strip-mall hell by unbridled real estate developers . There 's an extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities surrounded by open space . Cyclists can slip out of the city and be in quiet farmland in a matter of a few miles . POPULATION : 200,000-500,000 1 DENVER What 's Great About It : Massive network of interlinked paths * World-class riding on the outskirts of the city " Natural " Advocacy : Denver was recently named a Cycling Friendly Community by the League of American Wheelmen  --  one of the largest cities to receive this award . The city 's network of off-road bike paths is mostly the work of Mayor Wellington E. Webb , the city council and the bicycle advisory committee , working from Denver 's soon-to-be  --  updated Bicycle Master Plan . There 's no major advocacy group in Denver , but Bicycle Colorado is working to form one , which should speed enhancements . The Trail System to Envy : You can literally get anywhere in Denver on one of these paths , which is rare for such a large metropolitan area . The two major bike arteries in Denver are the Platte River and Cherry Creek Trails , which trace their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , linking up to other trails along the way The southern end of the Platte now intersects the C470 trail , which allows even further access to the eastern and western portions of the city , and there 's a proposal that will extend the C470 to form a beltline that circles the entire city . And because Denver sits on a prairie , these trails are mostly flat-perfect for commuters avoiding a sweat . Fun Riding : The slopes of Mount Evans are within riding distance of Denver , and at 14,000+ feet above sea level , it 's the highest paved road in the continental U.S. Find out just how good a climber you really are at the annual Mount Evans Hillclimb , but do n't expect to win  --  Credit Agricole pro Jonathan Vaughters is known to show There 's also the Morgul Bismark route , which was popularized in the ' 80s by the Coors Classic and seen ( though not mentioned ) in the movie American Flyers . For mountain biking , the county boasts a whopping 30,000 acres in 17 openspace parks-all less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speed : Colorado Springs is just an hours drive away , and home to the Olympic Training Center , the 7-Eleven Velodrome and USCF and NORBA headquarters , so you never know when America 's top talent might be in town . 2 MADISON , WI What 's Great About It : A longtime bike-friendly starting point for some of the best road riding in the Midwest Institutionalized Advocacy : while many cities are just now requiring new buildings to have bike facilities , Madison has done so for over 15 years . Critical Mass is becoming a regular event , and this year will see a huge windfall for Madison as two key connector paths link its trail network across the city Eighty percent of the bike paths link , so it 's easy to et anywhere . Winter ? Had Scores of commuters ride all year long , no matter how cold and icy it gets . For this reason , the city 's 25 miles of separate bike paths are plowed in the winter . Them 's tough folks . Easier to Ride : The core of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive around . The compact town layout and plenty of paths makes it easier to navigate on two wheels . Riding Ops : Wisconsin 's dairyland is crisscrossed with miles of rolling country roads . But to the northwest there are mile climbs with close to 800-foot elevation gains . Its easy to knock out a few thousand feet of climbing on one ride . The nearest major trail network is Kettle Moraine State Park 's more than 30 miles of singletrack  --  about an hour away Black Hills Mountain Bike Park-one of very few private mountain bike parks-is nearby . Madison 's citizen 's racing series always draws a large turnout . just show up with a bike and a helmet and you 're ready to go . The WORS ( Wisconsin Off  --  Road Racing Series ) draws 1,200-1,500 racers-a huge turnout for a non-NORBA series . Cycling Culture : Madison is home to the University of Wisconsin , and much of the student body gets around on two wheels . Half the employees of Trek bicycles call Madison home , and Andy Hampsten , still the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison bike shop years ago . 3 TUSCON , AZ What 's Great About It : Winter ? Never heard of it-dry air with 300 days of sunshine * Bike-friendly culture that stands out from other sprawling Sunbelt cities Best Thing About Riding There : The advocacy is top-shelf-but it seems more meaningful as you slather on SPF 30 while thinking about your friends up north chipping ice off their windshields . The palm tree climate combined with bike-friendly infrasructure makes this city one of the premier winter destinations for pro cyclists . Women 's all-out racing sensation Genevieve Jeanson fled the snow of her native Montreal for Tucson . Commuting Paths and More : University of Arizona students make bike commuting ubiquitous . Bike lanes and paths fan out from the campus and crisscross the city Policy was recently changed to automatically include bike lanes in any new road construction-in the rare cases where that 's not possible , a wide outside lane is used . Commuters appreciate the flat terrain in the city , while hardcore types opt for the 27-mile climb up 9,000  --  foot Mt . Lemmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and singletrack that snake into the desert right from the edge of town . Coolest Cycling Event : El Tour de Tucson , a November ride that covers 110 miles . The lead group , packed with pros , races the course full-tilt boogie while 4,000 riders behind compare their times to the " winner . " POPULATION : 500,000 TO 1 MILLION 1 SEATTLE What 's Great About It . Bikes have been planned as part of the transportation mix for more than 30 years 0 Hip , progressive culture with many avid cyclists 40-Year Plan ! Much like the U.S. interstate highway plan created in the 1950s , Seattle envisioned a system of urban trails in the early ' 70s . Now , completion of the network is in sight  --  land access deals with railroad and utility companies are complete , and funding for path con , " , fio , is falling into place . Ten years and $20 million dollars from now  --  fait acompli in the transportation biz  --  Seattle 's original vision will be a reality . The long-term scheme was especially important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wiggle room . Seattle is also building bike facilities with the next 100 years in mind . Example : Despite poor cycling access on both sides , the First Avenue South bridge includes a separate bike path . Currently , it sees 20 riders per day , tops-but the bridge wo n't be the missing link when future development ( not yet even planned ) improves adjacent roads for bikes . Bikes Downtown : Unlike some cities with hollowed-out cores , Seattle 's downtown is thriving . - With the dreadful motor vehicle congestion , the more people we have move downtown , the more bikes will be used to get around , " says Peter Lagerwey , Seattle 's bike coordinator . On-the-street traffic counts showed a 67% increase from 1990 to 2000 in the number of cyclists downtown . About 896 of the entire population bikes or walks to work , with a few neighborhoods breaking 20% . Citizens for Bikes : The city designated 35 neighborhoods recently , and each was asked to create a wish list for improvements ; 33 focused on bike and pedestrian issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it passed and netted $5.5 million over the next seven years . And requiring bike parking as part of new development is hardly necessary any more . Bikes are there , so people just put in bike parking regardless of the building code , - says Lagerwey . Cycling Population : Seattle bested all other cities we surveyed for membership in bike organizations , including USA Cycling , Adventure Cycling and the League of American Bicyclists . The city has hosted numerous national championship and Olympics trials races . Recreational riders flock to the Seattle-to  --  Portland ride , a 200-miler completed in one or two days , a promotion of the massive Cascade Cycling Club . 2 AUSTIN What 's Great About It . Broad spectrum of riding from road to mountain Strong pro-bike political climate ID Lance calls it home Advocacy in a Hostile State : Texas is dominated by cars , oil and urban sprawl-the state hates cyclists and recently tried to pass a bill that would essentially eliminate group rides and keep bikes off roads without shoulders . So Austin gets bonus points for being our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to struggle to stay cyclingcentric , but continues to progress . Austin 's population ( including 50,000 students at the University of Texas ) is fitness  --  and outdoor-oriented , so the four fulltime city employees in the Bike Program do n't have a lot of public opposition to spending money for bike facilities . They have some serious funding , too-about $20 million allocated from 1998 to 2006-and that 's not counting future federal grants that could be on the way . Learn From The Best : Officials from the Texas Bicycle Coalition went to the most bike-friendly city on the planet , Amsterdam , The Netherlands , to witness how cycling can drive a city . When they came back , the government contacted them with interest in what they 'd gleaned from their travels . World Class Road Riding : If Lance comes home to Austin to train , you can bet there 's plenty of challenging terrain nearby , like Balcones Ridge , an 800-foot rise into striking wooded hills , water and farmland-not the sand and cactus you see in western films . More than 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the west and flats stretching to the east . Decent Mountain Biking : Unlike most cities of this size , Austin has real mountain biking within city limits . The 8-mile City Park Loop on the edge of town was originally designed as a motorcycle park , so it 's way too aggressive for beginners . Lighter in-town off-road riding : the 7-mile Barton Creek Trail . The Lance Factor : Mayor Kirk Watson is pro-cyclist , and as a survivor of testicular cancer , he 's also friends with Lance Armstrong . Cycling has become even more visible and supported since Lance 's first Tour de France win , and a 6-mile path across town ( built with a $3 million grant ) will be named the Lance Armstrong Bikeway . Lance 's Ride for the Roses starts here , and it 's not uncommon to see a group of U.S. Postal jerseys flying up the hills outside town-and they 're the real thing . 3 SAN FRANCISCO What 's Great About It . Good weather Extremely active cycling community * Adjacent to some of the greatest roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5% of the region 's commuters , but they have a major impact on transportation policy . The San Francisco Bicycle Coalition ( SFBC ) endorsed eight candidates for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors-all were elected . The 11member board is the combined city and county council for San Francisco , and also the transportation authority for the city and county ; its planning places the highest priority on pedestrian and bicycle needs , followed by mass transit-then cars . The SF cycling community 's lobbying power helped persuade the state to chip in at least $50 million to build a bike lane from Treasure Island to Oakland and on the new Eastern span of the Bay Bridge . In ' 98 , pro-bike legislation included increased fines for parking in bike lanes ; requirements for bike facilities in new buildings and new and existing parking garages ; and at all large public events . Real Roads for Bikes : San Francisco is closing lanes to cars and opening them to bikes . The best example : Valencia Street was reduced from four car-going lanes to two car lanes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change , bike traffic jumped 144% to about 25% of the total traffic on the road-and injuries dropped 25% at the same time . SFBC recently secured $200,000 for improving pedestrian and bike conditions , and it was n't an issue . inner-city roads can be a rough and hectic grid of steep uphills and downhills , there are a few short rides around the Presidio , along Ocean Avenue and in Golden Gate park , and plenty of smooth ribbons of pavement not far from the heart of the city . Popular rides head north to ritzy Tiburon , or over the Golden Gate to the rolling hills of the Marin Headlands . Trails within the city are short and limited to Golden Gate Park , but a quick trip over the Golden Gate Bridge lands you in the spectacular trail networks of the Marin Headlands and Mount Tamalpias-the birthplace of modern mountain biking . And thanks to the SFBC , crossing the Golden Gate by bike is still free . POPULATION : 1 MILLION+ 1 MONTREAL What 's Great About It . Home of the biggest cycling events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kind of House : Recreational and commuting cyclists are helped by the private , non-profit le Groupe Velo . The organization of 45 full-time employees includes : Velo Quebec , whose staff of six are dedicated to advocacy and cycling facilities ; le Tour de file , which promotes events and tours ; and several bicyclerelated publications such as Velo Mag . Le Groupe Velo works out of La Maison de Cyclistes-the hot spot for bikies in the heart of the city . It includes a boutique that sells bike books , maps and other goodies , Cafe Bicicletta ( which serves healthy meals ) and a rental shop with 40 bikes and guided tours . Riding Room : Unlike many places , bikes are n't trying to wedge their way into the city New buildings are required to have bike parking , and more than 185 miles of bike lanes and paths are integrated into the city . Plus , there are 350 more miles of bike paths and lanes in the greater Montreal metro area , so cyclists are n't slapped by bike-hostile suburbs when they cross the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de resistance of cycling events is the Tour de file ( Tour of the Island ) -a 40-mile loop through the city closed to autos . With 45,000 participants , it 's billed as the world 's biggest bike ride . Night owls opt for Un Tour la Nuit , a 12-mile , after-hours ride ( punctuated with an outdoor concert ) that promotes safe night-riding practices . Impressive as these are , both probably pale in comparison to Le Tour de Enfants , in which 10,000 cyclists age 6-12 pedal 15 miles through the city , sans parents . The kids ' ride is the culmination of a bike safety campaign that includes BD Velo , a comic book distributed through 200 schools that teaches youngsters two-wheeled safety . Racing Heritage : The grueling loop through Mount Royal Park has seen the world 's top racers do battle at the world championships ( 1974 ) , the Olympics ( 1976 ) , and in more recent years , World Cup road races . Mountain bike world championships have twice been held at nearby ski resorts . Montreal 's many European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Slip out of the city and pedal pancake-flat roads along the St. Lawrence River , including the Route Vert ( Green Route ) , a 1,500-mile network of bike paths , lanes , and marked routes through Quebec paid for with $57 million from the provincial tourism board . The final 1,100 miles of the route are scheduled for completion by 2004. 2 CHICAGO What 's Great About It . The mayor is overtly pro-bike 0 bike lanes , routes , paths and racks are now as common as six-packs of Old Style Rising Star : No city is faster improving its facilities for cycling . In 2001 , the nation 's third-largest city is adding an impressive 40 miles of bike lanes . Chicago leads the nation in bike parking , with more than 6,500 racks installed . After years of effort by advocates , 85 buses were equipped with bike racks eartier in 2001-and bikes now have access to CTA trains as well ( except during weekday rush hours ) . In the past 3 years , the number of full-time employees working on bikes has swelled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while over the same time grants have gone from $3.2 million to nearly $9 million . Cyclists in High Places : " My goal is to make the city of Chicago the most bike-friendly city in the United States , " Mayor Richard Daley stated ( in writing no less ) . Daley is a real-deal cyclist , who 's been planning a coast-to-coast ride , broken into weeklong segments so he can still run the city . He does much more than just glad-hand about cycling . A mayor 's bicycle advisory task force was formed in 1991 ; the Bike 2000 Plan was drawn up and most of its goals implemented ; and this year his Bicycle Ambassadors program began . Minion bureaucrats now have bikes on the brain . " Different commissioners come in and each tries to impress the mayor with their department 's bike accomplishments , " says Ben Gomberg , bicycle program coordinator for the city . Gomberg 's office , by the way , recently received a personal note from Daley asking for more bike racks at City Hall-how cool is that ? Bicycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its kind in the U.S. ( The idea began in Toronto . ) After training in public speaking and bike safety issues , ambassadors go to community meetings , festivals , and other events to talk up bikes . They hand out brochures and maps , explain street-smart riding techniques and go into neighborhoods that have new bike lanes so locals know how to use them . 3 SAN DIEGO What 's Great About It : Perfect riding weather all year long-and plenty of cyclists to share it with Plus Advocacy Efforts : Because of the weather , the whole city is fanatical about fitness , so planning for plenty of recreational space , bike paths and trails happens without a big fight . " When a new road goes in , it 's not an issue of , will there be a bike lane there , but what will the bike lane look like , " says Kathy Keehan of the San Diego Bicycle Coalition . " It 's a city priority to accommodate bikes . It 's just assumed that there will be bicyclists everywhere , so they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Already there are more than 500 miles of paved and unpaved bike lanes and paths , and there 's a big push to connect all the trails with popular tourist destinations ( like the San Diego Zoo ) as well as shopping , recreation areas and working hubs . There 's a 20-year plan that aims at making it possible to ride easily anywhere in the city . The Latest : San Diego is tackling several ambitious projects , including a new trail system from Vulcan Mountain to the ocean , and a bike and pedestrian bridge across Lake Hodges . The problem is n't lack of public or government support , and there 's no shortage of ideas for cycling facilities-it 's just an issue of funding . But cyclists can count on at least $1 million a year from the transportation tax . And the Riding : Head out Highway 1 for a Sunday afternoon amble along the ocean , or bust a leg up Palomar Mountain . The twice-a-year Rosarito Ensenada runs up the coast from Baja California and claims to be the largest organized fun ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiesta goes from noon ' til sunset . Mountain bikers get hilly terrain and plenty of trail access . Pro Culture : The nearby Olympic Training Center draws many of America 's top racers , and several Euro pro teams have training camps here-Domo 's Axel Merckx calls the area home when he 's not in Europe . HONORABLE MENTIONS Philadelphia : Though Philly has some catch-up to do to equal places like Portland or Montreal , conditions are improving rapidly-like the miles of bike lanes that have been added in the last few years . Plus , the city embraces the country 's biggest race , the US Pro Championships , and mountain bikers can snake through singletrack in the 4,167 acre Wissahickon Park-right in the city itself . Ranked #9 in ' 99 . It has n't gotten worse-other cities have done more . Vancouver : Innovations such as a simple but comprehensive signage system for bikes routes through the city-so good other cities like Portland are copying it . Surrounded by tush mountain and some of North America 's best mountain bike traits . Honorable mention twice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , its dense urban core and progressive policies still get big thumbs up . But in 1998 , Toronto and several surrounding cities were amalgamated , increasing population and area sixfold . The auto-dominated landscape of the annex slides Toronto out of our rankings . Minneapolis : Maybe you do n't think cycling when this frigid midwestern city is mentioned , but bikes are on the upswing here . As home to the University of Minnesota , bike travel is natural here , which the city is accommodating with miles of lanes and paths and thousands of bike parking spots . And hey , Greg LeMond lives in the ' hood . Honorable mention in ' 99 . WORST CYCLING CITIES HOUSTON took a big turn for the worse after being named a Bike Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists in 1996 . The city rivals Los Angeles in pollution , urban sprawl and traffic congestion , and construction has been delayed indefinitely on many of the bike route systems its government promised . Really bad : The city recently removed ISTEA-funded bike lanes along West Dallas Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On average , roads are narrow and bike paths are poorly maintained , with potholes , misdirecting signs and no map system . Bike parking facilities and racks on busses are scarce . Unlike in most other major cities , cyclists might soon be prohibited from riding in dedicated bus lanes along the right side of major roads . Issues are so bad that the city is being sued for several of its anti-bike maneuvers . But all is not lost-officials recently hired a new bicycle coordinator . Have fun , pal . ATLANTA has the right ingredients for good cycling conditions : universities , warm weather and a healthy group of cyclists and advocates . And with lousy air quality , it would make sense for the city to get people onto bikes . But no : There are a paltry few miles of bike lanes in the whole city , none where they 're really needed . A shame : 120 bike racks ( $40,000+ worth , procured for the 1996 Olympics ) have been sitting in a warehouse for the last five years . There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation sums up Atlanta 's commitment to bikes-plenty of resources , zero effort . ON THE BUBBLE : BOSTON This progressive , thriving city made our worst list in 1999and was on our list again until a lastminute hiring of Paul Schimek ( who has a Ph.D . in transportation planning ) as the new bicycle program manager . Boston makes noise-within a year after being named a worst city in ' 99 , the mayor signed an executive order creating the Boston Bicycle Advisory Committee ( BBAC ) , and the city began drafting its first-ever bicycle plan . Plus , city council members Paul Scapicchio and Mike Ross are active , concerned cyclists . But all that really happened in three years-until Schimek 's hiring-was the installation of 300 bike racks . We know Boston can make better progress-and get off our worst list for good . Someone send Mayor Tom Menino to Chicago or Portland so he can see how it 's done . <p>
