Ben Rosenbaum 's first story , " The Ant King " ( July 2001 ) was a surreal venture into the realm of the underworld ( or was it the speculation about venture capital and dot-coms that was surreal ? ) . Now he brings us something very different , a far  --  future vision with enough of an erotic element to earn this one an " R " rating from the MPAA . The question of what the Motion Picture Association of America is doing in the far future rates up there with Groucho 's question of how the elephant got in his pajamas , but what can you say ? The future is indeed another country . <p> 1 . TODAY SHAR IS MARILYN Monroe . That 's an erotic goddess from prehistoric cartoon mythology . She has golden curls , blue eyes , big breasts , and skin of a shocking pale pink . She stands with a wind blowing up from Hades beneath her , trying to control her skirt with her hands , forever showing and hiding her white silk underwear . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality . My skin is hard , hairless , glistening black . Faint fractal patterns of darkerblack writhe across my surfaces . I have long claws . It suits my mood . We have just awakened from a little nap of a thousand years , our time , during which the rest of the world aged even more . She goes : " kama : //01-nbX5-# ... " I snap the channel shut . " Talk language if you want to seduce me . " Shar pouts . With those little red lips and those innocent , yet knowing , eyes , it 's almost irresistible . I resist . " Come on , Narra , " she says . " Do we have to fight about this every time we wake up ? " " I just do n't know why we have to keep flying around like this . " " You 're not scared of Warboys again ? " she asks . Her fingertips slide down my black plastic front . The fractals dance around them . " There are n't any more , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 've all killed each other . Or turned themselves off . Warboys do n't last if there 's nothing to fight . " Despite the cushiony-pink Marilyn Monroe skin , Shar is harder than I am . My heart races when I look at her , just as it did a hundred thousand years ago . Her expression is cool . She wants me . But it 's a game to her . She 's searching the surface of me with her hands . " What are you looking for ? " I mean both in the Galaxy and on my skin , though I know the answers . " Anything , " she says , answering the broader question . " Anyone who 's left . People to learn from . To play with . " People to serve , I think nastily . I 'm lonely , too , of course , but I 'm sick of looking . Let them come find us in the Core . " It 's so stupid , " I groan . Her hands are affecting me . " We probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her hands find what they 've been searching for : the hidden opening to Shivol'riargh 's sexual pocket . It 's full of the right kind of nerve endings . Shivol'riargh is hard on the outside , but oh so soft on the inside . Sometimes I wish I had someone to wear that was n't sexy . " We 'll figure it out , " she says in a voice that 's all breath . Her fingers push at the opening of my sexual pocket . I hold it closed . She leans against me and wraps her other arm around me for leverage . She pushes . I resist . Her lips are so red . I want them on my face . She 's cheating . She 's a lot stronger than Marilyn Monroe . " Shar , I do n't want to screw , " I say . " I 'm still angry . " But I 'm lying . " Hush , " she says . Her fist slides into me and I gasp . My claws go around her shoulders and I pull her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and float over Ship 's bottom eye , looking down at the planet Shar had Ship find . It 's blue like Marilyn Monroe 's eyes . " It 's water , " Shar says . Her arms are wrapped around my waist , her breasts pressed against my back . She rests her chin on my shoulder . I grunt . " It 's water all the way down , " she says . " You could swim right through the planet to the other side . " " Did anyone live here ? " " I think so . I do n't remember . But it was a gift from a Sultan to his beloved . " Shar and I have an enormous amount of information stored in our brains . The brain is a sphere the size of a billiard ball somewhere in our bodies , and however much we change our bodies , we ca n't change that . Maka once told me that even if Ship ran into a star going nine-tenths lightspeed , my billiard-ball brain would come tumbling out the other side , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of matter it is or how it works , but there 's plenty of room in my memory for all the stories of all the worlds in the Galaxy , and most of them are probably in there . But we 're terrible at accessing the factual information . A fact will pop up inexplicably at random - the number of Quantegral Lovergirls ever manufactured , for instance , which is 362,476 - and be gone a minute later , swimming away in the murky seas of thought . That 's the way Maka built us , on purpose . He thought it was cute . 3 . An old argument about Maka : " He loved us , " I say . I know he did . Shar rolls her eyes ( she 's a tigress at the moment . " I could feel it , " I say , feeling stupid . " Now there 's a surprise . Maka designed you from scratch , including your feelings , and you feel that he loved you . Amazing . " She yawns , showing her fangs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our minds are almost Interpreter-level . " She snorts . " We were trade goods , Narra . Trade goods . Classy purchasable or rentable items . " I curl up around myself . ( I 'm a python . ) " He set us free , " I say . Shar does n't say anything for a while , because that is , after all , the central holiness of our existence . Our catechism , if you like . Then she says gently : " He did n't need us for anything anymore , when they went into the Core . " " He could have just turned us off . He set us free . He gave us Ship . " She does n't say anything . " He loved us , " I say . I know it 's true . 4 . I do n't tell Shar , but that 's one reason I want us to go back to the Galactic Core : Maka 's there . I know it 's stupid . There 's nothing left of Maka that I would recognize . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could think more and know more and play more complicated games . Eventually the only thing that could satisfy them was to rebuild their brains as a soup of black holes . Black hole brains are very fast . I know what happens when a person does n't have a body anymore , too . For a while they simulate the sensations and logic of a corporeal existence , only with everything perfect and running much faster than in the real world . But their interests drift . The simulation gets more and more abstract and eventually they 're just thoughts , and after a while they give that up , too , and then they 're just numbers . By now Maka is just some very big numbers turning into some even bigger numbers , racing toward infinity . I know because he told me . He knew what he was becoming . I still miss him . 5 . We go down to the surface of the planet , which we decide to call Droplet . The sky is painterly blue with strings of white clouds drifting above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad Shar brought us here . We 're dolphins . We chase each other across the waves . We dive and hold our breaths , and shower each other with bubbles . We kiss with our funny dolphin noses . I 'm relaxing and floating when Shar slides her rubbery body over me and clamps her mouth onto my flesh . It 's such a long time since I 've been a cetacean that I do n't notice that Shar is a boy dolphin until I feel her penis enter me . I buck with surprise , but Shar keeps her jaws clamped and rides me . Rides me and rides me , as I buck and swim , until she ejaculates . She makes it take extra long . Afterward we race , and then I am floating , floating , exhausted and happy as the sunset blooms on the horizon . It 's a very impressive sunset , and I kick up on my tail to get a better look . I change my eyes and nose so I can see the whole spectrum and smell the entire wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudder that takes over my dolphin body , kicks me into the air and then into a racing dive , dodging and weaving . Then it hits me as knowledge , the signature written in the sunset : beryllium-10 , mandelium , large-scale entanglement from moon dispersal . Nuclear and strange-matter weapons fallout . Warboys . Ship dropped us a matter accelerator to get back up with , a series of rings floating in the water . I head for it . Shar catches up and hangs on to me , changing into a human body and riding my back . " Ssh , honey , " she says , stroking me . " It 's okay . There have n't been Warboys here for ten thousand years ...... " I buck her off , and this time I 'm not flirting . Shar changes her body below the waist back into a dolphin tail , and follows . As soon as she is in the first ring I tell Ship to bring us up , and one dolphin , one mermaid , and twelve metric tons of water shoot through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns black and crowded with stars . " Ten thousand years , " says Shar as we hurtle up into the sky . " You picked a planet Warboys had been on ! Ship must have seen the signature . " " Narra , this was n't a Warboy duel - they would n't dick around with nuclear for that . They must have been trying to exterminate a civilian population . " The water has all sprayed away now and we are tumbling through the thin air of the stratosphere . " There 's a chance they failed , Narra . Someone might be here , hidden . That 's why we came . " " Warboys do n't fail ! " We grow cocoons as we exit the atmosphere and hit orbit . After a couple of minutes , I feel Ship 's long retrieval pseudopod slurp me in . I lie in the warm cave of Ship 's retrieval pseudopod . It 's decorated with webs of green and blue . I remember when Shar decorated it . It was a long time ago , when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sit up . Shar is lying nearby , picking at the remnants of her cocoon , silvery strands draped across her breasts . " You want to die , " I say . " Do n't be ridiculous , Narra . " " Shar , seriously . It 's not enough for you - I 'm not enough for you - I 'm not enough for you . You 're looking for Warboys . You 're trying to get killed . " I feel a buzzing in my head , my breathing is constricted , aches shoot through my fist  --  clenched knuckles : clear signs that my emotional registers are full , the excess externalizing into pain . She sighs . " Narra , I 'm not that complicated . If I wanted to die , I 'd just turn myself off . " She grows legs and stands up . " No , I do n't think you can . " What I 'm about to say is unfair , and too horrible . I 'll regret it . I feel the blood pounding in my ears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free us all the way . Maybe he just gave us to each other . Maybe you ca n't leave me . You want to , but you ca n't . " Her eyes are cold . As I watch , the color drains out of them , from black to slate gray to white . She looks like she wants to say a lot of things . Maybe : you stupid sentimental little girl . Maybe : it 's you who wants to leave - to go back to your precious Maka , and if you had the brains to become a Wizard you would . Maybe : I want to live , but not the coward 's life you keep insisting on . She does n't say any of them , though . She turns and walks away . 6 . I keep catching myself thinking it , and I know she 's thinking it too . This person before me is the last other person I can reach , the only one to love me from now on in all the worlds of time . How long until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how long can I stand her if she does n't ? 7 . The last people we met were a religious sect who lived in a beautiful crystal ship the size of a moon . They were Naturals and had old age and death and even children whom they bore themselves , who could n't walk or talk at first or anything . They were sad for some complicated religious reason that Shar and I did n't understand . We cheered them up for a while by having sex with the ones their rules allowed to have sex and telling stories to the rest , but eventually they decided to all kill themselves anyway . We left before it happened . Since then we have n't seen anyone . We do n't know of anywhere that has people left . I told Shar we could be passing people all the time and not know it . People changed in the Dispersal , and we 're not Interpreters . There could be people with bodies made of gas clouds or out of the spins of elementary particles . We could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her sadder . 8 . We go down to Droplet again . I smile and pretend it 's all right . We spent a thousand years , our time , getting here ; we might as well look around . We change ourselves so we can breathe water , and head down into the depths . There are no fish on Droplet , no coral , no plankton . I can taste very simple nanomites , the standard kind every made world has for general upkeep . But all I see , looking down , is green-blue fading to deep blue fading to rich indigo and blackness . Then there 's a tickle on my skin . I stop swimming and look around . Nothing but water . The tickle comes again . I send a sonar pulse to Shar ahead , telling her to wait . I try to swim again but I ca n't . I feel fingers , hands , holding me , where there is only water . Stroking , pressing against my skin . I change into a hard ball , Shivol'riargh without head or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the hands from the gentle current . I fiddle with my perceptions until I remember how to send out a very fine sonar wave , and to enhance and filter the data , discerning patterns in very fine perturbations of the water . I subtract out the general currents and chaotic swirls of the ocean , looking only for the motions of the water that should not be there , and turn it into a three-dimensional image of the space around me . There are people here . Their shapes - made of fine motions of the water - are human shapes , tall , with graceful oblong heads that flatten at the top to a frill . They are running their watery hands over the surface of me , poking and prodding . From below , Shar is returning , approaching me . Some of the water people cluster around her and stop her , holding her arms and legs . She struggles . I can not see her expression through the murk . The name " Nereids " swims up from the hidden labyrinths of my memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Nereids back away , arraying themselves as if formally , three meters away from me on all sides . A sphere of Nereids surrounds me . Shar stops struggling . They let her go , pushing her outside the sphere . One of the Nereids - tall , graceful , broad-shouldered  --  breaks out of the formation and glides toward me . He places his hands on my surface . This , I tell myself to remember , is what we were designed for . Alone among the Quantegral Lovergirls , Shar and I were given the flexibility and intelligence to serve all the possible variations of post-Dispersal humanity . We were designed to discover , at the very least , how to give pleasure ; and perhaps even how to communicate . Still , I am afraid . I let the hard shell of Shivol'riargh grow soft , I sculpt my body back toward basic humanity ; tall , thin , like the Nereids . This close , my sonar sees the face shaped - out of water smile . The Nereid raises his hands , palms out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a slight resistance in the water . I part my lips . The Nereid 's head cautiously inches toward mine . I close my eyes and raise my face , slowly , slowly , to meet the Nereid 's . We kiss . It is a tickle , a pressure , in the water against my lips . Our bodies drift together . When the Nereid 's chest touches my breasts , I register shock : the resistance of the water is denser . It feels like a body is pressing into mine . The kiss goes on . Gets deeper . A tongue of water plays around my tongue . I wonder what Shar is thinking . The Nereid releases my hands ; his hands run slowly from the nape of my neck , across my shoulder blades , down the small of my back , fanning out to hold my buttocks . I open my eyes . I see only water , endless and dark , and Shar silent and still below . I smile down to reassure her . She does not move . My new lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never invisible . It is as if the ocean is making love to me . I like it . The familiar metamorphosis of sex in a human body overtakes me . Hormones course through my blood ; some parts grow wet , others ( my throat ) grow dry . My body is relaxing , opening . My heart thunders . Fear is still there , for what do I know of the Nereid ? Pleasure is overwhelming it , like a torrent eroding granite into silt . A data channel crackles , and I blink with surprise . Through the nanomites that fill the sea , the Nereid is sending . Out of the billions of ancient protocols I know , intuition finds the right one . Spreading my vulva with its hand , the Nereid asks : May I ? A double thrill of surprise and pleasure courses through me : first , to be able to communicate so easily , and second , to be asked . Yes , I say over the same archaic protocol . A burst of water , a swirling cylinder strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that once evolved to fit its prototype , in other bodies on another world . I hold the Nereid tight . I buck and move . Empty blue surrounds me . The ocean fucks me . I raise the bandwidth of my sensations and emotions gradually , and the Nereid changes to match . His skin swirls and dances against mine , electric . There is a small waterspout swirling and thrashing inside me . The body becomes a wave , spinning me , coursing over me , a giant caress . I allow the pleasure to grow until it eclipses rational thought and the sequential , discursive mode of experience . The dance goes on a long time . 9 . I find Shar basking on the surface , transformed into a dark green , bright-eyed Kelpie with a forest of ropy seaweed for hair . " You left me , " I say , appalled . " You looked like you were having fun , " she says . " That 's not the point , Shar . We do n't know those creatures . " The tendrils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It might not have been safe . " " You did n't look worried . " " I thought you were watching . " She shrugs . I look away . There 's no point talking about it . 10 . The Nereids seem content to ignore Shar , and she seems content to be ignored . I descend to them again and again . The same Nereid always comes to me , and we make love . How did you come to this world ? I ask in an interlude . Once there was a Sultan who was the scourge of our people , he tells me . The last of us sought refuge here on his favorite wife 's pleasure world . We were discovered by the Sultan 's terrible warriors . They destroyed all life here , but we escaped to this form . The Warriors seek us still , but they can no longer harm us . If they boil this world to vapor , we will be permutations in the vapor . If they annihilate it to light , we will be there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , I tell him . We gained more . We did not know how much . His hands caress me . This pleasure I share with you is a fraction of what we might have , if you were one of us . I shiver with the pleasure of the caress and with the strangeness of the idea . His hands flicker over me : hands , then waves , then hands . You would lose this body . But you would gain much more , Quantegral Lovergirl Narra . I nestle against him , take his hands in mine to stop their flickering caress . Thinking of Maka , thinking of Shar. 11 . " It 's time to go , Narra , " Shar says . Her seaweed hair is thicker , tangled ; she is mostly seaweed , her Kelpie body a dark green doll hidden in the center . " I do n't want to go , " I say . " We 've seen this world , " she says . " It only makes us fight . " I am silent , drifting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little cold . I 've been under for so long . I grow some green Kelpie tresses myself , so I can soak up energy from the sun . Shar watches me . We both know I 've fallen in love . Before Maka freed us , when the Wizards had bodies , when we were slaves to the pleasure of the Wizards and everyone they wanted to entertain , we fell in love on command . We felt not only lust , but pure aching adoration for any guest or client of the Wizards who held the keys to us for an . hour . It was the worst part of our servitude . When Maka freed us , when he gave us the keys to ourselves , Shar burned the falling-in-love out of herself completely . She never wanted to feel that way again . I kept it . So sometimes I fall , yes , into an involuntary servitude of the heart . I look up into the dappled white and blue of the sky , and then I tune my eyes so I can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Shar , moved on with her into that night . But maybe this is the end of the line . Perhaps , if I abandon the Nereids , there is no falling-in-love left in this empty , haunted Galaxy with anyone but Shar . Who does not fall in love . Not even with me . " I 'm going back to Ship , " Shar says . " I 'll be waiting there . " I say nothing . She does n't say , but not forever . She does n't say , decide . I float , soaking the sun into my green seaweed hair , but I ca n't seem to stop feeling cold . I hear Shar splashing away , the splashes getting fainter . My tears diffuse into the planet sea . After a while I feel the Nereid 's gentle hands pulling me back down . I sink with him , away from the barren sky . 12 . I lie in the Nereid 's arms . Rocked as if by the ocean . I turn off my sense of the passing of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is calling you . I emerge slowly from my own depths , letting time 's relentless march begin again- My eyes open . Above , the blue just barely fades to clearer blue . As I hit the surface I hear Shar 's cry . Ship is directly overhead , and the signal is on a tight beam . It says : Narra ! Too late . Tell your friends to hide you . I shape myself into a disk and suck data from the sky . What ? I yell back at her , confused and terrified . Then dawn slices over the horizon of Droplet , and Shar 's signal abruptly cuts off . The Warboy ship , rising with the sun , is massive and evil , translucent and blazing white , subtle as a nova , gluttonous , like a fanged fist tearing open the sky . They are approaching Droplet from its sun - they must have been hidden in the sun 's photosphere . Otherwise Ship would have seen them before . Run , Shar , I think , desperate . Ship is fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaits the Warboys , silent , perched above Droplet 's atmosphere like a sparrow facing down an eagle . " Let us remake you , " the Nereid 's voice whispers from the waves , surprising me . " And Shar ? " I say . " Too late , " says the liquid , splashing voice . Warboys . The word is too little for the fanged fist in the sky . And I am without Shar , without Ship . I look at my body and I realize I am allowing it to drift between forms . It 's like ugly gray foam , growing now spikes , now frills , now fingers . I try to bring it under control , make it beautiful again , but I ca n't . I do n't feel anything , but I know this is terror . This is how I really am : terrified and ugly . If I send a signal now , the Warboys will know Droplet is not deserted . Perhaps I can force the Nereids to fight them somehow . I make myself into a dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will hide you in the center , " says the liquid voice . Shar , I say , but only to myself . I do not send the signal that would bring death down upon me . I abandon her . The Nereids pull me down , into the deep . I do not struggle . The water grows dark . Above there is a faint shimmering light where Shar faces the Warboys alone . Shar , my sister , my wife . Suddenly the thought of losing her is too big for me to fathom . It drowns out every other pattern in my brain . There are no more reasons , no more explanations , no more Narra at all , no Droplet , no Nereids , no universe . Only the loss of Shar . The glimmer above fades . After a while the water is superdense , jellylike , under the pressure of the planet 's weight ; it thickens into a viscous material as heavy as lead , and here , in the darkness , they bury me. 14 . Here is what happens with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What am I dealing with here ? " " Those , " says Ship , " are some of our brothers , Shar . Definitely Wizard manufacture , about half a million years old in our current inertial frame ; one Celestial Dreadnought 's worth of Transgenerate , Polystatic , Cultural-Death Warboys . I 'm guessing they were the Palace Guard of the Sultanate of Ching-Fuentes-Parador , a cyclic postcommunalist metanostalgist empire/artwork , which - " " Stay with the Warboys , Ship , " Shar says . " What can they do ? " " Their intelligence and tactical abilities are well above yours . But they 're culturally inflexible . As trade goods , they were designed to imprint on the purchaser 's cultural matrix and adhere to it - in typically destructive Warboy style . This batch should n't have outlasted the purchasing civilization , so they must have gone rogue to some degree . " " Do they have emotions ? " " Not at the moment , " Ship says . " They have three major modes : Strategic , Tactical , and Ceremonial . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment and the like - they have a full human emotional/sensorial range . In Ceremonial Mode they 're also multicate , each Warboy pursuing his own agenda . Right now they 're patrolling in Tactical Mode , which means they 're one dumb , integrated weapon - like that , they have the least mimetic drift , which is probably how they 've survived since the destruction of the Sultanate . " " Okay , now shut up and let me think , " Shar says and presses her fingers to her temples , chasing some memories she can just barely taste through the murky labyrinth of her brain . Shar takes the form of a beautiful , demihuman queen . She speaks in a long-dead language , and Ship broadcasts the signal across an ancient protocol . " Jirur Na'alath , Sultana of the Emerald Night , speaks now : I am returned from ray meditations and demand an accounting . Guards , attend me ! " The Warboy ship advances , but a subtle change overtakes it ; rainbows ripple across its white surface , and the emblem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Warboys are in Ceremonial Mode . " So far so good , " says Shar to Ship . " Watch out , " says Ship . " They 're smarter this way . " The Warboys " signal reaches back across the void , and Ship translates it into a face and a voice . The face is golden , fanged , blazing ; the voice deep and full of knives , a dragon 's voice . " Prime Subject of the Celestial Dreadnought Ineffable Violence speaks now : I pray to the Nonpresent that I might indeed have the joy of serving again Sultana Na'alath . " " Your prayers are answered , Prime Subject , " Shar announces . Ineffable Violence is braking , matching Ship 's orbit around Droplet . It swings closer to Ship , slowing down . Only a hundred kilometers separate them . " It would relieve the greatest of burdens from my lack-of-heart , " Prime Subject says , " if I could welcome Sultana Na'alath herself , the kindest and most regal of monarchs . " Ten kilometers . Shar stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt me ? Has my Ship not transmitted to you signatures and seals of great cryptographic complexity that establish who I am ?

But alas , data is only data , and with enough time any forgery is possible . " Fifty meters separate Ship 's protean hull from the shining fangs of the Dreadnought . Shar 's eyes blaze . " Have you no sense of propriety left , that you would challenge me ? Have you so degraded ? " The Warboy 's eyes almost twinkle . " The last Sultan who graced Ineffable Violence with his sacred presence left me this gem . " His ghostly image , projected by Ship , holds up a ruby . " At its core is a plasm of electrons in quantum superposition . Each of the Sultans , Sultanas , and Sultanons retired to meditation has one like it ; and in each gem are particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uh oh , " says Ship . " I prized mine very much , " says Shar . " Alas , it was taken from me by - " " How sad , " says Prime Subject . The fangs of Ineffable Violence plunge into Ship 's body , tearing it apart . Ship screams . Through the exploding membranes of Ship 's body , through the fountains of atmosphere escaping , three Warboys in ceremonial regalia fly toward Shar . They are three times her size , golden and silver armor flashing , weapons both archaic and sophisticated held in their many hands . Shar becomes Shivol'riargh , who does not need air , and spins away from them , toward the void outside . Fibers of some supertough material shoot out and ensnare her ; she tries to tear them with her claws , but can not . One fiber stabs through her skin , injects her with a nanomite which replicates into her central configuration channels ; it is a block , crude but effective , that will keep her from turning herself off . The Warboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violence . Prime Subject floats in a spherical room at the center of the Dreadnought with the remaining two Warboys of the crew . The boarding party tethers Shar to a line in the center of the room . " Most impressive , Your Highness , " Prime Subject says . " Who knew that Sultana Na'alath could turn into an ugly black spider ? " Three of the Warboys laugh ; two others stay silent . One of these , a tall one with red glowing eyes , barks a short , high-pitched communication at Prime Subject . It is encrypted , but Shar guesses the meaning : stop wasting time with theatrics . Prime Subject says : " You see what an egalitarian crew we are here . Vanguard Gaze takes it upon himself to question my methods of interrogation . As well he should , for it is his duty to bring to the attention of his commander any apparent inefficiency his limited understanding leads him to perceive . " Prime Subject floats toward Shar .

" You wo n't survive long except as a mindless weapon . You wo n't last long as people . " He does not react , but Shar notices a stiffening in a few of the others . It is only a matter of a millimeter , but she was built to discern every emotional nuance in her clients . " Oh , we 'll want to linger in this mode a while .

That other Lovergirl half a million years ago did her job well , she thinks , to have planted the seed of lust in this aging , mad Warboy brain . One of the Warboys turns to go , but Prime Subject barks a command , insisting on-the ritual of sharing the booty . Shar takes a soft , vulnerable , human form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys . Let me try . " " The keys , robot ! " She flinches at the ancient insult . " No ! I 'm free now . I wo n't go back . I 'd rather die ! " " That , " says Prime Subject , " is not one of your options . " Shar cries . It 's not an act . He stabs her again . " Wait - " she says . " Wait - listen - one condition , then yes He chuckles . " What is it ? " She leans forward against her bonds , her lips straining toward him . " I was owned-by so many , " she says . " For a night , an hour - I ca n't go back to that . Please , Prime Subject - let me be yours alone - " The fire burns brightly in his eyes . The other Warboys are deadly still . He turns and looks at Vanguard Gaze . " Granted , " he says . Shar gives Prime Subject the keys to her mind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind with desire for him and fear of him . He slams her sensitivity to pain and pleasure to its maximum . He.plunges his great red ceremonial phallus into her . Shar screams . Prime Subject must suspect his crew is plotting mutiny . He must be confident that he can humiliate them , keeping the booty for himself , and yet retain control . But Shar is a much more sophisticated model than the Quantegral Lovergirl he had those half a million years before . So Prime Subject is overtaken with pleasure , distracted for an instant . Vanguard Gaze seizes his chance and acts . But Vanguard Gaze has underestimated his commander 's cunning . Hidden programs are activated and rush to subvert the Dreadnought 's systems . Hidden defenses respond . Locked in a bloody exponential embrace , the programs seize any available means to destroy each other . The escalation takes only a few microseconds. 15 . I am in the darkness near the center of the planet , in the black water thick as lead , knowing Shar was all I ever needed . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The outside edges of me bum . I pull into a dense , hard ball , opaque to everything . Above me , Droplet boils . 16 . It takes a thousand years for all the debris in orbit around Droplet to fall into the sea . I shun the Nereids and eventually they leave me alone . At last I find the sphere , the size of a billiard ball , sinking through the dark water . My body was made to be just one body : protean and polymorphic , but unified . It does n't want to split in two . I have to rewire everything . Slowly , working by trial and error , I connect the new body to Shar 's brain . Finally , I am finished but for the awakening kiss . I pause , holding the silent body made from my flesh . Two bodies floating in the empty , shoreless sea . Maka , I think , you are gone , but help me anyway . Let her be alive and sane in there . Give me Shar again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
