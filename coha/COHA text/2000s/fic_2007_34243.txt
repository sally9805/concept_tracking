Chapter One " I 'm taking you off the fire department beat , " Wayne Lenmore announced . Her newspaper editor 's words hit Sharon MacCabe like a leather palm . Hard . Stinging . Totally unexpected . Announcements like this should n't come on a Friday . Sharon searched the older man 's drooping features . She was too breathless to be hysterical , too numb to be outraged . She leaned back onto the hard , plastic visitor 's seat , seeking support . " Why ? " Wayne shifted in his battered blue office chair . It squeaked under his weight . " The publisher is going to assign someone else to the beat . He thinks you 're better with features . " Sharon flinched at the implication she could n't handle hard news . She 'd been covering the fire department for the Charleston Times for the past six months . The previous beat reporter had left the West Virginia daily for greater fame and fortune . The assignment had taken her one step closer to her dream of becoming an investigative reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , or weekends in the office learning about firefighting and meeting department officials . She 'd worked for years to prove herself capable of handling a hard news beat . She 'd finally been assigned to oneonly to have it snatched away from her . She gripped the chair 's cool , plastic arms . " Are you dissatisfied with my work ? " Wayne 's pale gray gaze slid from hers . " Your work is fine . " His comment was n't resounding praise , but neither was it criticism . Sharon clenched her fists in her lap to isolate her shaking . " Then why am I being demoted ? " " It 's not a demotion . We 're just shuffling personnel . " First , he demotes her , then he lies to her . The ice of shock melted under the heat of temper . " Who else are you shuffling ? " Wayne sat back and his seat screeched again . " At this time , no one . But additional reassignments may come later . " Something was wrong with this picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sprouted some wild hair and stomped her budding career into the ground . What was going on ? " Does Gus have a replacement in mind ? " Wayne finally looked at her . " Lucas Stanton . " Anger thumped in her chest , each pulse reverberating in her throat . " Senator Kurt Stanton 's nephew ? " " He starts Monday . " The state senator from Institute , West Virginia , was up for re-election in November . He faced a tight race over the next seven months against his challenger . What was Gus up to ? Sharon 's voice shook as she spoke . " What newspaper experience does the senator 's nephew have ? " Her boss sat straighter in his chair . " He received a degree in English from West Virginia State College . " " Oh , come on , Wayne . " Sharon 's chuckle held more scorn than humor . " You know there 's a world of difference between a comp paper and a news story . " " Everyone has to start somewhere . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't Stanton 's nephew do the same ? " " Because Aldridge wants him to start with the fire department . " Wayne rested his forearms on the stack of press releases and news clippings on his desk . It was n't quite nine A.M. , but already the sleeves of his white shirt were dusted with newsprint . Sharon swallowed her disappointment . " You told me it was my time to move up after Ernie went to the Baltimore Sun . Now you 're taking that away ? " Shame joined regret in Wayne 's tired eyes . " I 'm sorry , Sharon , but Stanton starts Monday . " He spoke with finality . Sharon took a steadying breath . The musty scent of newsprint filled her lungs . Her gaze wandered her boss 's office . It resembled a storage locker of newspapers . Rival papers . National papers . Small community weeklies . It was a definite fire hazard . Wayne 's room was one in a row of offices along one wall . Dim , dingy plasterboard formed three of its sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant a view of the reporters ' cubicles . Were people watching them now and , if so , what was their interpretation ? She looked again at her editor . " What about the feature interview I scheduled with the new fire station captain today ? And the fire department meeting this evening ? " " Features are your area . You can write up the captain 's interview . And go to the meeting . If anything comes from it , brief Stanton Monday . " Sharon 's temper spiked . She counseled herself not to let her emotions take over . Nothing would be gained by creating a scene . " Do you expect me to train my replacement ? " Her tone was hard but calm . " Do n't forget someone helped you when you first joined this paper , MacCabe . " " No , Wayne . I worked my way up from an intern . I was n't given someone else 's beat to curry political favor . " The flush started in Wayne 's neck and rose to spot the scalp beneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have your assignment , MacCabe . Take it and be glad you still have a job . " Although muttered , the words stung . Sharon pushed herself to her feet and crossed the fraying gray carpet to the door . She clenched her jaw to keep from hurling words she could not take back . She turned with her hand on the knob . " This newspaper is putting Stanton 's political connections above my experience . How does that serve our readers ? " She turned her back on Wayne 's guilty expression . Sharon walked down the aisle , past the newsroom 's gray-and-glass decor , and curious coworkers . Back at her cubicle , she continued to fume as she fired up her computer . A newspaper was no place for political cronyism . Among other things , people depended on the paper for information to actively participate in their democratic society . It should n't be used to advance someone 's agenda , which was obviously Gus 's intent . " What did that keyboard do to you ? " Sharon looked up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the entrance of Sharon 's cubicle , the inevitable mug of coffee cupped in her palms . " I 've been replaced on the fire department beat . " Fresh anger spurted into Sharon 's veins . Allyson 's hazel brown eyes widened in her tan , heart-shaped face . " Why ? " Sharon shrugged . " Gus wants to please his political buddy . Senator Stanton 's nephew starts Monday . " The other woman 's jaw dropped . In one fluid movement , she settled her mug on the corner of Sharon 's desk and displaced the folders from the guest chair to the floor so she could sit . The political reporter was a tall , willowy brunette . Her appearance was so feminine and unthreatening that new people at the capital usually did n't notice her sharp mind until it was too late . Allyson reclaimed her coffee . " How long has this been in the works ? " Sharon glanced at her watch . She did n't want to be late for her interview with the new fire station captain , Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked open her bottom desk drawer and grabbed her stash of pretzel rods . " Is this a temporary assignment or is he going to be permanent staff ? " " I have no idea . I was too upset to think of asking those questions . " Sharon bit into one of the pretzels . Low sodium , low fat , very little taste . Once this bag was finished , her healthier eating habits would die an unlamented death . Allyson leaned forward and touched the back of Sharon 's wrist . " I would have been too . This is just so strange . " " I know . " She offered the pretzels to Allyson , who declined the snack with a shake of her head . " Gus is a registered independent . Why would he cozy up to a particular politician ? " " Money and power . That 's what everyone 's ultimately after . " Sharon pulled her oversized , overstuffed purse from her desk drawer and heaved it onto her shoulder as she stood . " It used to be about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes later , Sharon followed the administrative assistant 's directions to an office at the opposite end of the main floor . The room was devoid of personal effects . If it were n't for the nameplate on the wall beside the door , she would n't have known she 'd found Matthew Payton . Charleston 's newest fire station captain looked over from his computer as Sharon paused in the doorway . With her reporter 's eye for detail , she cataloged his dark brown skin , prominent cheekbones and strong jaw . Full , well-shaped lips softened features so sharply drawn they could have been sculpted from the mountains that made her state famous . When he spun his chair forward , the woman in her caught the full effect of his broad shoulders , gift wrapped in a plain , white cotton shirt . He stood , smoothing his royal-blue-and-yellow tie . His midnight eyes held her gaze for a long moment . Sharon wondered whether he was going to invite her in or if he expected her to conduct the interview from the hallway . She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done much to improve her mood . She was still seething over her demotion . But this meeting would n't go well if she projected that anger on to her interview subject . Sharon found a smile and strode forward , hand extended . The captain met her halfway and wrapped his long , blunt fingers around hers . His touch was firm and warm . She tilted her head to meet his eyes . He was at least seven inches taller than her five-foot-five . " I 'm Sharon MacCabe . Thank you for allowing me to interview you . " " You 're welcome . Have a seat . " Matthew 's deep , dark voice was even more compelling in person than it had been during their brief phone conversation . She watched him return to the large , brown executive seat behind his desk . He waited for her to sit before folding his lean body onto the chair . She was curious about the wariness in his eyes . Sharon crossed her legs , pulling her reporter 's notebook and mini-recorder from her bag . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , go ahead . " She turned on the recorder , then found a blank page for her notes . " Why would someone born and raised in a big city like Pittsburgh decide to move to a much smaller one like Charleston , West Virginia ? " Matthew leaned back in his chair , propping his elbows on its armrests . " I was ready for a change . " It took a moment for Sharon to realize he was n't going to elaborate . " What kind of change ? " Matthew paused as though considering her question-or maybe his answer . " The usual . A new place to call home and the challenges of a new job . " " This is your second week on the job . What challenges have you faced so far ? " Sharon 's hand sped across the page , transcribing his answers even as she " Nothing I ca n't handle . " The captain 's reticence to be interviewed fueled her curiosity . She was writing a harmless feature . To what could he possibly object ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper business-but he refused to relax . She switched her attention from her notepad to her interview subject . " I 'm sure you 're up to these challenges , Captain , but could you give us examples of them ? " Matthew again appeared to weigh his response . " Recreating a fire scene is always challenging . " " In addition to being the station 's captain , you 're also the lead fire investigator . How will the dual roles influence the station 's fire inspection procedures ? " " I wo n't discuss that until we 've completely reviewed those procedures . " The interview was n't going well . Sharon smothered a sigh and went back to the basics : age , rank , and hobbies . How did he like the Mountain State ? What tourist attractions had he seen so far ? What was he looking forward to experiencing next ? With each question , Matthew 's answers became more relaxed . Sharon was pleased with the interview 's improvement as her pen flew across the notepad . " What was your job with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firefighter . " She glanced up . " A lieutenant ? " " No , a firefighter . " " How did you jump from being a firefighter to station captain and lead investigator ? " Indignation flared in Matthew 's midnight eyes . " I had the skills the fire chief and assistant chief were looking for . " " What are those skills ? " Matthew heard the incredulity in the reporter 's voice . He also sensed her anger . He did n't know why she was upset ; he was the one on the hot seat . He had n't wanted to be featured in the Charleston Times . However , his new boss , Assistant Chief of Administration Brad Naismith , and Fire Chief Larry Miller insisted the story would help improve the department 's image in the community . Deciding to save his energy for more worthy battles , Matthew had agreed to the interview . The little reporter appeared harmless with her guileless ebony eyes . But he 'd learned from bitter experience the press was capable of twisting answers to seemingly innocent questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her shoulder . She repeated her question . Her soft , Southern accent reminded him of warm summer nights . " What are those skills ? " " I have twelve years of experience as a firefighter . " She arched a winged eyebrow . " Do you have any experience running a station ? " " Ms. MacCabe , I do n't have to give you my rsum . I 've already earned my job . " " I realize that . But the community has a right to know their fire station captain 's qualifications . " Matthew was n't going to play the public's-right-to-know game . The press had a wicked winning streak compared to both the interview subject and the public whose interest they professed to protect . He stood . " Chief Miller and Assistant Chief Naismith can vouch for my qualifications . Any other questions ? " The pint-sized reporter rose too . The modest cream dress shifted over her slender figure as she stepped closer to his desk . " Just one . Why are you so defensive ? " He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personality story , not an interrogation . " Her eyes sparked with anger and vivid color dusted her cheekbones . " I was n't interrogating you . I was asking simple questions . " " I 'm sure that 's what Woodward and Bernstein said before they brought down Nixon 's presidency . " He crossed his arms . " Not everyone you meet has a criminal intent . " The reporter 's sharp intake of breath let him know he 'd hit his target . " I 'm not out to get you . I 'm just doing my job . " " What is your job , Ms. MacCabe ? I thought reporters were supposed to cover the news , not pass judgment . " She stepped back as though he 'd struck her . He held her wide-eyed gaze , refusing to regret his words . Sharon turned from him to lift her oversized purse from the floor . She pulled the strap over her shoulder . " Thank you for your time . " She turned , back straight and head high . Long strides carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realization he 'd just crossed the media . In a normal situation , he would welcome the attention of an intelligent , attractive woman . But , circumstances as they were , this woman 's interest could burn him . Sharon paused in a corner of the station lobby , shaking with fury . She skimmed her notes . She had pages of inane questions and answers . They were enough for a surface piece that would entertain her readers , but they did n't delve far enough to satisfy her . She glanced down the hall toward the captain 's office . There was a lot more to Matthew Payton , but she would n't find out from him . She stuffed her reporter 's notebook into her bag and wove her way past groups of people entering and exiting the government building . Beyond the glass doors of the side entrance , she saw Li Mai Wong , Brad 's administrative assistant , sharing a smoke break with coworkers . Sharon pushed through the revolving doors and approached the tall , slender woman . She ignored the odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi , Li Mai . Do you have a moment ? " " Sure . " Li Mai drove her cigarette into a standing ashtray . " How 'd the interview go ? " " Fine , thanks . But it needs some background . " Sharon led her companion to a quieter section of the break area . She leaned against the side of the building , trying to appear more casual than she felt . " What can you tell me about your new captain ? " " He 's very nice . He does n't talk much , though . " " Is he a snob ? " " No , just quiet . He does n't talk much about himself . But he does ask a lot of questions . " Sharon pounced . " What kind of questions ? " Questions about how to do his job , maybe ? (
