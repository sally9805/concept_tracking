On her first day at the American school , Glynnis 's class dissects earthworms . At her old school , the fourth graders dissected cow eyes that came delivered in a plastic jug . But here , the worms are n't delivered . After lunch , the class has to find their own worms in the mud outside , then rinse them oft " under the bathroom sinks . Glynnis 's new teacher partners her with Leora Faust , a girl with crooked teeth and patchy brown bruises on her knees . Everyone else already has a partner . <p> That morning , Glynnis 's father drove her to the new school on his way to work . Her mother had refused to come along . " American children bring guns to school , " she said and kissed Glynnis on the top of the head . " So try not to piss anyone off . " Her father grew up in this town , and along the drive he pointed out things he remembered : a tire store that used to be an ice cream shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bank that has always been a bank , but used to have a different name . <p> Glynnis got to sit at her desk while the rest of the class stood to say the Pledge of Allegiance . She told her teacher that it would be treason for her to say it , that if they found out in England , they could have her head chopped off . Miss Glen cocked her head to one side and said , " Well , we would n't want that , would we ? " Until Glynnis was paired with Leora Faust , no one else had spoken to her . <p> Glynnis stands to the side , watching as Leora reads the directions from her science book . At the desk behind hers , a boy uses his knife to lift a sliver of guts from his worm . " Hey , Mary Poppins ! " he says and thrusts his knife towards Glynnis . <p> Two girls with matching Princess Lea buns in their hair laugh as Glynnis darts sideways . " Jer-e-mi-ah ! " they squeal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At her old school , the disturbed children had their own classroom in the basement , and even in there , Glynnis is pretty sure they were n't allowed to hold knives . <p> It 's a mess , this new school , a dirty scab of a place with orange carpet in the hallways and soggy hamburgers at lunch . Because the rain made the playground muddy , the class has to take their shoes off when they come inside and pile them up next to Jhe door . Glynnis has spent the whole day feeling cold and grubby in her socks . In England , they always got to wear their shoes inside . <p> " Check it out , " Jeremiah says to the Princess Lea girls and aims his knife at Leora Faust . As she bends forward over her science book , Jeremiah flicks his knife , springing worm guts onto the back of her head . Leora continues reading , keeping her place with her finger while the guts stick in her hair , dangling like a tiny slick sausage . <p> Miss Glen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to inspect work . When she comes up behind them , Glynnis holds her breath . Someone will have to tell . It is n't like Jeremiah made a nasty face or called Leora a name . There are dead parts hanging in her hair . Glynnis is sure the Princess Lea girls will say something . At her old school , it was always girls against boys . <p> Miss Glen stops just behind Glynnis and touches her crimson fingernails to one of the girls ' perfect braided buns . " Megan R. and Megan C. " she says . " You two always have the prettiest hair . " Glynnis waits . This is the time to tell . Miss Glen is on their side . <p> " My mom does it , " one of the Megans says . " Megan C. comes over before school , and my mom does us both . " <p> The Megans turn back to their work . Miss Glen is walking past . Glynnis stares down at her desk so that she wo n't have to see the worm guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leora 's hair . So this is America , then . Nobody is going to do anything . <p> While Glynnis and her father eat supper that night , her mother sits at the table , smoking cigarettes and drinking red wine from a paper cup . " Are n't you eating ? " her father asks . <p> " I hate the food here , " her mother says and waves her cigarette in front of her . " Everything tastes like cheese or chocolate . " <p> " It 's just soup , " says her father . <p> " It 's easy for you , " her mother says . " You 've been eating so much of this garbage , you stink of it . Both of you . " Glynnis puts her spoon down and sniffs at her shoulder . The new house smells like fresh paint and carpet cleaner . The yard smells like wet dirt . But her shoulder smells regular enough . <p> Glynnis 's father smiles and blinks his eyes quickly . " How about we try to be a little positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell us one thing about your new school . " <p> Glynnis opens her mouth to tell about Jeremiah throwing worm guts into Leora 's hair , but before any sound can come out , her father holds up his hand . " No , " he says . " Something good . " <p> Glynnis stops . Her father is watching , tapping his plastic spoon on the edge of his paper bowl . " I do n't know , " she says finally . <p> " Your teacher 's pretty , " he says , and her mother makes a choking noise in the back of her throat . " Do n't you think ? " <p> Glynnis has n't really thought about it , but she supposes Miss Glen is all right . She is n't old or fat or covered with big hairy moles . " Sure , " Glynnis says . " She 's pretty enough . " <p> She can see the cords in her mother 's neck tightening , the skin around her lips pulling thin . " Well , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <p> " Taxation without representation . What does that even mean ? " her mother asks while Glynnis is in the bathtub . Glynnis is trying to explain about the Social Studies lesson . They love their wars , Americans , love to talk about them and watch filmstrips about them and look at pictures of them in books . Only her first day and already Glynnis knows all about George Washington and the Redcoats and Paul Revere screaming his head off across the countryside . The British are coming ! The British are coming ! <p> " You 'd think they would have gotten over it by now , " her mother says . " A slight overcharge for tea , and we 're still on their list . " <p> " Miss Glen says it was a long time ago , " Glynnis tells her mother . " She says that America saved us in a couple of big wars , and so we 're all great friends again . " <p> " She sounds like a nincompoop , " her mother says and bends over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of her head with a barrette . This is their time together , girl time , her mother calls it . Her father never bothers them , never knocks or calls or tries to come in . But still , her mother locks the door . <p> " Did you make any friends ? " her mother asks and sits down on the lid of the toilet . <p> Glynnis scrubs herself hard with the soap , just in case the food smell is still on her . " There was one girl , " she says . " We cut up a worm together . " <p> Her mother 's face freezes . <p> " It was for Science , " Glynnis says . " Miss Glen made us partners . " <p> Her mother closes her eyes and smiles . " Oh , " she says . " That does n't count , then . You did n't make a friend . " She stands up and peels out of her blue jeans and sweater , dropping them onto the floor . " Scoot up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Glynnis moves forward , pulling her knees to her chest as her mother lowers herself into the water behind her . She rubs Glynnis 's back with the heel of her hand . " Was school terrible ? " she asks , and Glynnis slides back between her mother 's legs , leaning onto her chest . <p> " They never raise their hands , " she says . " Nobody talks to me , and the classroom smells like dirty feet . " <p> " It 's the same way here , " her mother says . She touches her mouth to the top of Glynnis 's head . " I miss home . " <p> " So do I , " says Glynnis . <p> " I was born there , " her mother whispers . <p> " So was I , " says Glynnis . <p> Her mother touches one wet finger to the curve of Glynnis 's ear , tracing the lobe with her fingernail . " What does your teacher look like ? " <p> Glynnis tries to think . " She has black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paints her fingernails red . And she smiles a lot . " <p> Glynnis can feel the rise and fall of her mother 's chest against her shoulder blades . " Can I sleep in your bed tonight ? " her mother asks , and Glynnis nods . Her mother circles her wet arms around Glynnis 's shoulders . " Nobody loves you as much as I do , " she says . <p> " I know , " says Glynnis . <p> Her mother tightens her arms and dips her head forward so that Glynnis can feel her breath on the back of her ear . " Now you say it to me , " her mother whispers . <p> " No one loves you as much as I do . " <p> The cafeteria does n't have enough chocolate milk for everyone in line . Because of this , it is a race to be first . Miss Glen tries to make it fair . " Today , " she says to the class , " people with the letter M in their name may be the first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and run to the door , cramming their feet into matching pink sneakers . Glynnis puts her chin in her hand and waits . Next come people with Bs , then H 's . Most of the class is in line , and Glynnis feels the sadness inside her like a bag of wet sand . She does n't even like chocolate milk . <p> When Miss Glen calls I , Glynnis slides out of her desk and follows Leora Faust to the back of the line . Miss Glen starts to lead the class into the hallway , and Glynnis hurries to get her laces tied . <p> " My shoe 's gone ! " Leora yells , and Miss Glen stops . " Somebody stole my shoe ! " <p> Miss Glen walks to the back of the line , her bright mouth puckered like a prune . " Leora , " she says , and she sounds tired . " No one stole your shoe . Let 's hurry now so that we do n't make everyone late for lunch . " <p> Leora looks like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the absolute wrong thing to do . " I ca n't find my shoe , " Leora says , and her voice is small and squeaky . <p> Miss Glen closes her eyes and rubs her forehead with her fingers . " Let 's all look for Leora 's shoe , " she says and sighs at the ceiling . <p> When Jeremiah pulls the shoe out of the trash can , he swings it at Leora by its laces . " Somebody must have thought it was garbage , " he says . <p> On the way to the lunchroom , the hallway echoes with shouts of " Leora-shoe-germs ! No touch-backs ! " One by one , the shoe germs pass down the line . Glynnis walks behind Leora , who has n't taken the time to put her shoes all the way on and clipclops down the hallway with her heels bunched out over the backs . When the germs pass to Leora , they stop . She does not turn around to pass her own germs to Glynnis . <p> In the cafeteria , Glynnis eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan R. is passing out pink envelopes with stickers on them . " It 's a slumber party , " she tells the girls at her table . " My mom is buying mud masks and cucumbers so we can do facials . " <p> " Your birthday parties are always the best , Megan , " says one of the girls . <p> " I know , " says Megan R. " But it 's going to be expensive , and my mom wo n't let me have as many people this year . We have to keep it a secret . " The rest of the girls smile , and Megan R. lowers her voice . " I do n't want people to have their feelings hurt . " <p> It is simple who is to blame for this . At some point in the early party-planning , parents said how many people got to come , how many friends your life had room for . Sometime , weeks before Glynnis even existed at this school , Megan R. 's mother had said a number . A list was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plain white milk and waiting for the bell to ring so that she can throw her food away and go back to the classroom . <p> After school , Glynnis sits cross-legged on her bed while her mother stands naked in front of the closet . At the new house , all the closet doors are made of mirrors , and this is what her mother does now while her father is at work-look at herself naked . <p> " There 's one girl at school that everybody 's mean to , " Glynnis tells her mother . " Even the teacher . " <p> Her mother is standing sideways in the mirror , pulling the skin on her stomach smooth , then letting it pooch again . " It 's like that sometimes , " she says . " For some people , it 's like that . " This is something that Glynnis appreciates about her mother , the way she does n't pretend like she can fix things . <p> " Why ? " Glynnis asks , and her mother shrugs . <p> " Some people just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They make it too easy for people to be mean . " <p> Glynnis thinks about this . At her old school there was a girl who said loud , screechy prayers before every meal and every exam , always Jesus this and Jesus that . But nobody ever threw her shoes in the garbage can . Nobody ever passed her germs around . " But why does n't she have any friends ? " Glynnis asks , and her mother turns to look at her . <p> " I do n't have any friends , " she says . <p> " At home you do , " Glynnis says . " You have lots . " <p> " No . " Her mother crosses her arms over her breasts , pressing them flat against her body . " I do n't . " <p> Glynnis uses her fingernail to scrape a piece of dried mud off the bottom of her shoe . " What about Judy ? " she asks and flicks the clump of mud off the bedspread . " What about Rachel and Linda and Katie Bell from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Not anymore , " her mother says . " I do n't have any friends anymore . " <p> The girls , that 's what her mother called them . They had grown up together , had gone to the same schools , listened to the same music , told the same stories about the same people . When Glynnis came home in the afternoons she would find them on the back porch , smoking cigarettes and sipping cocktails out of fancy glasses . " Girls , " they whispered to each other when they had something important to say . Glynnis would sit on her mother 's lap and take tiny sips from her frosted glass while they talked about old boyfriends and first kisses , women they 'd known who had gotten fat or poor or divorced . They finished each other 's sentences , her mother 's friends , clipping their stories together , filling in each other 's missing details , telling jokes in unison , screaming with laughter at the mention of a name , a place , a word that meant nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father the American , and when he came home from work they would take turns dancing with him around the kitchen table . " You 're lucky , " they told him while the radio played in the background . " American women are loud and fat . They chew with their mouths open . " He wagged his finger at them while Glynnis and her mother laughed into their hands . " Do n't you ever let him steal you away , " they said to Glynnis 's mother , and she promised that she would n't . <p> " How come they 're not your friends anymore ? " Glynnis asks . " Is it because we moved ? " <p> Her mother is staring at her reflection , tracing the tips of her fingers along her lips , pressing them into the hollows beneath her eyes . " Ask your father , " she says , and Glynnis sits up straight . <p> " Why did we come here ? " she asks . <p> Her mother looks down at the carpeting , pushing the knobs of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He lied , " she says . " He lied to me . " <p> Glynnis thinks about this . One little lie does n't seem like such an important thing . If that 's the only reason , then maybe they do n't have to stay here . They 're not even unpacked yet . " Maybe he 's sorry , " Glynnis says and climbs to her knees . " Really sorry , I mean . Like that time I spilled grape soda on the carpet and blamed it on the lady who used to clean our house ? Maybe it 's like that ! " <p> " It is n't , " her mother says . " It is n't at all like that . " She narrows her eyes at Glynnis in the mirror . " And you can just stop bouncing up and down because we are n't going back . " <p> Glynnis sinks back onto her heels , and her mother lifts her breasts , pinching the nipples between her fingers . " Do you think I 'm ugly ? " she asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother sighs . <p> " You have to say that , " she says . " You look just like me . " <p> For supper , her mother gives them cheese macaroni on paper plates , then sits at the table smoking a cigarette and drinking from her paper cup . Her father takes a big bite of macaroni and then gives them the thumbs-up sign . " Super ! " he says , and her mother makes a hissing noise in the back of her throat . " Not eating ? " he asks , and when her mother does n't answer , he claps his hands and rubs them together . " Well , " he says , smiling . " Let 's hear something good about school , Glynnis . " <p> Glynnis looks at her mother to see if she has to answer , but her mother 's head is tilted backwards , blowing smoke rings at the ceiling . " The coolest girls are Megan R. and Megan C. , " she says . " They wear matching hair and pink shoes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's nice , " her father says . <p> " It 's Megan R. 's birthday on Friday , and she 's having a slumber party . Only the best girls get to go . " <p> Her mother 's head snaps up . " A slumber party ! " she says and shimmies her shoulders over the table . " I loved slumber parties . We used to laugh until we threw up ! " <p> " Charming , " her father says , but her mother ignores him . <p> " We used to put a girl 's fingers in warm water while she was sleeping so that she would wet herself . " Her mother dips her head forward , laughing into her chest . " Then when she woke up , we 'd lock her outside so that she 'd have to ring the doorbell and walk through the house in front of everyone ! " <p> " You did that to your friends ? " Glynnis asks , and her mother cocks her head . <p> " Of course not , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " <p> " Why would you do that to anyone ? " Glynnis asks , and her mother rolls her eyes . <p> " For fun " she says . <p> " It does n't sound like fun , " Glynnis says , and her father coughs into his shoulder . <p> " Maybe not to you , " her mother says . " You 're such a stick . " <p> " I 'm not invited to go , anyway , " Glynnis says , and her father looks up . <p> " Why not ? " he asks . <p> Glynnis blinks at her plate of macaroni . " I 'm new . " <p> Her father reaches across the table and puts his hand on top of hers . " You wo n't be new for long , " he says and squeezes her fingers . Glynnis feels a knot pressing into the back of her throat . She wants to close her eyes and lean her head forward onto the back of her father 's wrist . <p> " You were supposed to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at her . " Up until the very last second . But your father changed his mind . " <p> " What ? " Glynnis asks . <p> " Oh , " he says . " Yeah . It reminded me of breakfast . Eggs and bagels or something . I do n't know . I liked Glynnis . " He smiles at her across the table . " Are n't you lucky to be one of a kind ? " <p> Her mother watches as Glynnis slides her hand away from her father and drops it into her lap . <p> After her bath that night , Glynnis sits on her bed while her mother plays with the radio , turning through static until she finds a station with bright , bouncy music . " Want me to paint your fingernails ? " she asks , and Glynnis shakes her head . Her insides are still jumping at the near miss of her own stupid name . <p> " I 'm really tired , " Glynnis says , but her mother shakes the little bottle in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " It 'll make you pretty . " <p> At lunch the next day , Miss Glen announces that people with pink fingernails can be first in line , then winks one almondshaped eye at Glynnis . There is groaning . Both of the Megans have normal , naked fingernails . <p> While Glynnis is waiting to get her tray , she hears a rustling behind her and turns to see the Megans leaning out of line . " New Girl , " Megan R. whispers and waves to get her attention . " Get us a chocolate milk . " She thrusts her hand forward , and Glynnis looks down at the money . <p> Nothing good can come of this . If Glynnis takes the money , the Megans will think she is weak , willing to give something for nothing . If she does n't , they will hate her forever . The Megans narrow their eyes , and the rest of the class watches . This is the choice : enemy or servant . Glynnis does n't know which is worse . <p> When Leora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious . " It 's against the rules , " she says to Glynnis . " It 's cheating , and it 's against the rules . " <p> " M-Y-O-B , " says Megan C. , and Leora touches Glynnis on the arm . <p> " You 're not supposed to , Glynnis . Miss Glen might call your mom , and then you 'll get in trouble . " Leora 's fingers feel smooth and cold in the crook of Glynnis 's elbow , and for a second , she wants to put her hand on Leora 's bony little shoulder . She wants to tell her not to worry , that everything is going to be fine . <p> But the Megans turn to each other , speaking with the silent language of their eyes . It is something Glynnis has seen her mother do with her friends , a lengthening of the neck , a raised eyebrow , a slow curl at one side of the mouth . In a moment it will be too late . She has to do something . <p> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm away . " / do n't want your stinky germs . " <p> Leora 's breath comes out in one hot gasp . " I 'll tell , " she says , but her voice is small , buried somewhere deep inside her chest . " I 'll tell Miss Glen on all of you . " <p> Megan R. steps forward , resting her hand on one cocked hip . " Then we 'll all say you 're lying , " she says . Leora looks down at her scruffy brown shoes , and Glynnis snatches the money from Megan R. A second , maybe less , and they are all back in line . <p> " I was almost a Megan , " Glynnis says when they sit down at her table . She passes them each a chocolate milk , and Megan C. looks at her doubtfully . <p> " Almost ? " she asks . <p> " It 's my mother 's favorite name in the world , " Glynnis tells them . " But my father changed it at the last second . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan R. asks . " If that 's what she wanted to name you ? " <p> Glynnis thinks about this . " He lied , " she says after a moment . " He changed it without telling her , and she did n't find out till after . " <p> " That sucks , " says Megan R. , but she is looking over the top of Glynnis 's head , waving to get the attention of the girls who usually sit at her table . <p> " She 's still ripped up about it , " Glynnis says . " My mother only calls me Megan . " <p> " We have one too many people , " Megan R. says , counting chairs around the table . " We 'll have to squeeze . " <p> The table fills in around them , and Glynnis sits with her elbows pinched to her sides while the other girls talk about the slumber party . " My dad 's going to make oysters Rockefeller , " Megan R. says . " They 're my favorite . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Have you ever had them ? " she asks , and Glynnis blushes . <p> " My dad does n't cook , " she says , and Megan smiles at the rest of the table . <p> " Well , " she says . " You do n't know what you 're missing . " <p> Glynnis pokes at her lunch . The gravy on her chicken-fried steak is brown and clumpy , and she scrapes it to the edge of her tray while the other girls plan prank phone calls and talk about what movies Megan R. should ask her mother to rent for the party . <p> " At my old school , we used to put a girl 's hand in warm water and make her wet herself at slumber parties , " Glynnis says , and the rest of the girls look at her . <p> " Wet herself ? " Megan C. asks . " Like , pee her pants ? " <p> Glynnis nods . " We waited for someone to fall asleep , and then after we made her wet , er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For one glorious moment , the Megans look at Glynnis , and she can feel the doors of her future swing wide open . She will buy pink tennis shoes . She will wear her hair in fancy braids . She will be the Megan with interesting stories-the Continental Megan . <p> But even as Glynnis is imagining the three-way phone calls and notes passed in class , the Megans turn towards each other . They touch fingers . Glynnis can feel her lungs empty like two shriveled balloons . It does n't matter how many stories she has , how many cafeteria rules she breaks . She could eat lunch at this table every day for the rest of her life , go to every party , share in every conversation . Still , she wo n't ever know them as well as they know each other . <p> " We have to do that , " Megan R. whispers . " Who could we do that to ? " <p> " The water has to be really warm , " Glynnis says . " Or else it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan C. says . " We should do that to Leora . " <p> Glynnis moves her food around on her tray while the rest of the girls discuss the best way to convince Megan 's mom to let her invite an extra person . They will say Leora helped with a Social Studies project . It might work . Megan R. stands up and crosses the cafeteria to the table where Leora is sitting alone . <p> Glynnis can not watch . Leora Faust is small and strange-looking with greasy hair and dirty fingernails . But she has never done anything to Glynnis . Leora ca n't know the way the world has been planning against her . Glynnis 's mother , Megan R. 's mother , they all had a part . Strangers bumped into each other 's lives , moved things around without credit or knowledge or blame . One day , Glynnis and her mother had seen her father sitting in the window of a restaurant , sharing a soda with Katie Bell from across the street . And then they 'd moved . Snip , snip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glynnis was left in this new one . Megan R. was wrong when she said that Glynnis did n't know what she was missing . The whole wide world was just a big pile of strangers , thinking all the time about everything they were missing . <p> Glynnis 's father says that she can not eat Pop-Tarts for dinner . He peels back the bread from his cheese sandwich and shakes the salt and pepper shakers over the square of yellow cheese . " I 've been working all day , " he says to her mother . " You could at least unpack some boxes . You could at least heat something up . " <p> Her mother does n't answer . She holds her paper cup against her chest and sways her hips around the kitchen counter , like she is listening to music . Glynnis sits down at the table and uses her teeth to tear open the foil wrapper of her Pop-Tart . Her father looks up at her . " I said no , " he says . " Not for dinner , Glynnis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told what to do . Her mother glances at the Pop-Tart and then at Glynnis 's father . She yawns and clutches her paper cup in both hands as she twirls around the counter and sways quietly out of the room . When Glynnis looks back at her father , he is watching her hard , his mouth small and tight in the corners . Glynnis keeps her eyes on his as she folds back the foil wrapper . He shakes his head , a warning , and Glynnis stares straight at him . Very slowly , she fills her mouth with Pop-Tart and makes her face big with chewing . <p> When her father stands up , Glynnis is afraid he is going to hit her . He raises his hand , and the Pop-Tart turns to concrete inside her mouth , grit and dirt and gravel . But her father does n't hit her . Instead , he hits the table . He slams the flat of his hand down hard so that the table shakes over Glynnis 's legs and the salt and pepper shakers tip sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he yells . <p> The words stay in the room even when the sound has stopped . The walls hold them there like a cold , creeping fog . Glynnis stares down at all the salt and pepper loose across the table . She sits in her chair long after her father has left the kitchen , using the ridge of her fingernail to separate the salt and pepper into little piles , salts with salts , peppers with peppers , so they will be with their friends . So they wo n't be afraid . <p> " Friday Flip-Up Day ! " Jeremiah screams on the playground before school starts . Leora Faust is wearing a skirt with big cartoon frogs on it , and the boys chase her around the tire swing , catching the hem of her skirt in their fingers and lifting it over her white underpants . <p> " Stop it ! " she screams , spinning in circles and swatting their hands away like bees . " Leave me alone ! " <p> Jeremiah laughs . " You know what Friday is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skirt . " <p> Leora breaks away , sprinting across the muddy grass to the classroom . Glynnis leans back against the brick wall with the Megans , tugging at her corduroy pants and thanking God that all her skirts are still packed in boxes somewhere . <p> " Leora 's mom said she could come to my party , " Megan R. says when the bell rings . " You 're so cool for thinking of that warm water thing . I really wish I could invite you , too . " <p> Glynnis follows them into the classroom . " I 'm sure your party will be really fun , " she says politely . But her head is loose and swimmy on the cord of her neck , her limbs slow and heavy . Glynnis sits through the morning with her head propped on both hands . Her stomach feels like a cold wet rag , and she pushes her fist into it , trying to make it believe she is n't hungry . Glynnis 's mother had been asleep by the time she finished with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath and pressed her body against her mother 's . She had stayed awake all night , listening to the sounds of her stomach sloshing and to the slow , wheezy snorts of her father 's breathing coming from the big bedroom where he slept alone . <p> At recess , Glynnis begins to follow the Megans , but Miss Glen calls her back . " You 're looking a little scruffy today , " she says . Glynnis looks down to make sure that her blouse is clean , that she 's put her shoes on the right feet . " Would you like me to fix your hair for you ? " Miss Glen asks , and Glynnis runs her fingers over the back of her head . Her mother was still asleep when Glynnis left for school , and she had tried to put her own hair in a French braid . She worked until her fingers ached , but it had come out wrong , crooked and lumpy . <p> Glynnis stands perfectly still while Miss Glen uses her fingers to comb out her hair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair into sections . " It must be hard to be so far from home . " <p> " I guess so , " Glynnis says . She does n't want to think about England or her old school or the house she used to live in . What 's the point ? She ca n't go back . <p> " Of course , this is your home , too , " Miss Glen says . <p> Glynnis is quiet . It would be rude to argue with her teacher . <p> " Your father 's American ? " Miss Glen asks . Glynnis can feel Miss Glen 's hands tugging on her hair as she nods . " So you are , too . You have dual citizenship . Do you know what that means ? " When Glynnis does n't answer , Miss Glen sighs . " It means you 're very special , " she says . " You have two countries . Everyone else at this school only has one . I think we can all learn a lot from each other . " <p> Glynnis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a construction-paper version of Betsy Ross 's flag . " What if there 's a war ? " she asks , and the words feel loose and clunky inside her mouth . " Like before ? " <p> Miss Glen snaps the rubber band around the end of Glynnis 's braid . " You do n't have to worry , " she says . " That wo n't ever happen . " She squeezes Glynnis 's shoulders . " All done . " <p> Glynnis 's hair feels smooth and tight around her face , like it is pulling her mouth back and holding her eyes wide open . " Thank you , " she says . But as she leaves the classroom , Glynnis can feel the doubt creeping up the back of her throat . Ever is an awfully long time . <p> Outside , Glynnis looks around for the Megans . They are on the mdnkey bars , but before she can cross to them , she sees Leora Faust , slouched and shaking on the grass . " Are you sick ? " Glynnis asks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on her hands and knees , raking the wet grass with her fingers . When she lifts her head to look at Glynnis , her whole face is red and patchy with crying . " I lost a button , " she says between hiccups . " A button off my shirt . I lost it . " <p> " Do n't be such a bawl-baby , " Glynnis says and glances over her shoulder to make sure the Megans are n't watching . " Get off the ground . " <p> " I 'll get in so much trouble , " she wails . " You have to help me find it . " Leora reaches up and grabs Glynnis 's arm with her wet , muddy hand . " Please , Glynnis . Help me . " <p> This is all she needs . If the Megans look over and see Glynnis with Leora , they 'll think she wants to be here . They 'll think she 's made a choice . " It 's just a button , " Glynnis says , but Leora is crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wet grass sticking to the backs of her hands . " No-no-no-no-no , " she says . " Oh please , please no . " Her face is slick with tears and snot , and she uses the backs of her wrists to wipe her eyes as she crawls through the grass , smearing wet , grimy streaks across her forehead . Glynnis can not walk away . She can not leave her here like this . <p> " My mom will kill me ! " Leora shrieks , and Glynnis winces in the direction of the Megans . She leans forward and pretends to look in the grass . <p> " Maybe it fell off in the classroom , " she says . " It 's probably on the floor by your desk . " <p> Leora shakes her head , spinning on her knees to feel the grass behind her . " The boys were pulling at my shirt , " she says . " When I was over here . It must be over herel " She is yelling now , choking on her own screechy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it . " <p> " Shut up , then , " Glynnis hisses . " People are looking . " <p> Out of the corner of her eye , Glynnis can see the boys on the basketball court glancing in their direction . Her ears prickle with heat , and she feels her way down the front of her blouse until she reaches the last button . It does n't put up much of a fight . One good yank , and it pops right off in her fingers . Glynnis is about to hold it out , about to say , " Here , you big crybaby , just take this and stop wailing , " when Leora leans forward onto her elbows , her bony spine heaving . <p> " I wo n't be able to go to the party now , " Leora says , and Glynnis goes still . " I 've never been invited to a slumber party . " <p> Glynnis strokes the button with her thumb and forefinger . " You have n't ? " she asks . " Not ever ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I already got a present and everything , " she sniffs . Glynnis squeezes the button in her palm , and Leora turns on her back , letting one arm fall loosely across her chest . " I got her a book of different braids she can do with her hair , " she says . " It came with ribbons and sparkly barrettes and things . I thought her mom could use it when she does her and Megan C. 's hair before school . " <p> Leora raises one knee , and her skirt falls up around her white thighs . Glynnis looks away , embarrassed . Ca n't Leora see the way things are ? Did she ever stop to wonder why Megan R. , who , as far as Glynnis can tell , has never said a single nice thing to Leora , would suddenly up and invite her to a birthday party ? No . She just went running out and bought a present . <p> Glynnis feels the button , smooth and silky between her fingers . It is nothing , really-a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet skirt tangled around her muddy legs , the hint of underpants peeking out beneath the bunched-up hem , and suddenly Glynnis hates her . She hates Leora for being so weak , for making it so easy . Glynnis squeezes the button in her fist . " I do n't think we 're going to find it , " she says . <p> When the recess bell rings , Leora stands up , her bare legs streaked with dirt and grass . As they file into the classroom , Miss Glen sighs through her teeth and points at Leora . " You 're a mess , " she says . " Go to the girls ' room and clean yourself up . " <p> Glynnis keeps her head down as she pushes her shoes off in the doorway . On her way to her desk , she opens her hand and lets the button fall into the trash can . <p> Glynnis is waiting for the school bus when her father 's car pulls up in the parking lot . " Why are n't you at work ? " Glynnis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " It 's starting to rain . " <p> Glynnis climbs into the car , and mud flakes off her shoes onto the floor . " I thought we could go get something to eat , " her father says . " Just you and me . We can go to a restaurant and order whatever we want . It 'll be like a date . " Glynnis can feel the grumbling in her stomach , and she thinks of a warm , cozy booth where they will share French fries and get cheesecake for dessert . But then she thinks of her mother , alone and naked in the new house , waiting for her . <p> " I have homework , " she says . <p> " It 's Friday , " her father tells her . " You have the whole weekend . " <p> " I have a lot , " she says . " We start the Civil War next week . " <p> Her father sighs . " Fine , " he says . <p> When they come through the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying her bathrobe around her waist . Her lips are purple with wine . " What are you doing here ? " she asks . <p> Her father stands in the front hallway , looking through the mail . " I took the afternoon off , " he says . " I picked Glynnis up from school . " <p> Her mother nibbles at the rim of her paper cup . " What happened to your hair ? " she asks , and Glynnis reaches back to feel her braid . <p> " Miss Glen did it for me , " she says . <p> " Looks nice , " her father says without lifting his head . <p> " I lost a button , " Glynnis tells her mother and holds out the bottom of her blouse . " At school . It fell off or something . " <p> Her mother glances down at the shirt . " Throw it away , " she says , and Glynnis 's father looks up . Her mother smiles at him . " Daddy 'll buy you a new one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at each other in the front hallway to answer . It 's Megan R. <p> " Glynnis ? " she says . " Leora 's mom just called . Leora ca n't come to my party . " <p> Glynnis can feel her heartbeat in the back of her throat . " I did n't think her mother would really say no just because of a button , " she says , and there is silence on the other end of the phone . <p> " What ? " asks Megan . " She 's sick , that 's what her mom said . " <p> " Sick ? " Glynnis asks . " She seemed fine at school . " <p> " I guess so , " says Megan . " But who cares ? I told my mom all about you , about how you 're new , but you 're super cool , and she said you can come instead of Leora . Is n't that the best news ever ? " <p> Glynnis says that it is . Maybe Leora really is sick . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if she is sick , it would only make things worse to lock her outside after she had wet herself . <p> " I know it 's last minute , " Megan tells her . " But my mom says we can come pick you up , if that makes it easier . " <p> When Glynnis walks back to her parents , they are still in the front hallway . Her mother is stroking the collar of her robe with one hand and balancing her paper cup in the other . " That was Megan R. , " Glynnis says . " Inviting me to her slumber party tonight . " She pulls at her mother 's arm . " We have to hurry , " she tells her . " We need to find a present . " <p> Her mother looks at her blankly . " You 'd spend the night ? " she asks . " The whole night ? " <p> " It 's a slumber party , " Glynnis says again , and her mother bites her lip . <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her forehead . " I do n't think I want you to do that . " Glynnis opens her mouth , but before any words come out , her father interrupts . <p> " Why ? " he asks , and Glynnis and her mother look at him . " Why ca n't she go ? " <p> Her mother shakes her head and turns to walk into the den . Glynnis and her father follow . " I do n't know these people , " she says . " And I wo n't have her going off with strangers . " <p> " You can meet them , " Glynnis tells her . " And then they wo n't be strangers . " <p> Her mother chews her purple lips with her teeth . " I want you here , " she says in a small voice . " With me . " <p> " Do n't do this , " her father says , and his voice is low and serious . " Do it to yourself if you have to , but do n't do it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " her mother asks and turns to face her father . <p> " This is home now , " he says . " We live here . " <p> " Whose fault is that ? ' her mother asks , and her face tightens into something mean and ugly . Glynnis watches her father straighten and broaden across the shoulders , making himself look larger than he is . Her knees begin to wobble . Her hands and feet go cold . <p> " It 's just for one night , " she whispers , but no one is listening . <p> " You , " her father says . " You 're the one who said we had to move . I would have stayed . But you said no . " <p> Glynnis looks at her mother . This ca n't be true . It ca n't be . <p> Her mother 's head snaps up , and her eyes narrow . " You and Katie Bell , " she says . " How could I have stayed after that ? " <p> " We 've talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was over . I made my choice . " <p> Her mother drops her chin to her chest and squeezes her paper cup until it caves in on one side . " You took everything , " she whispers . " You let them laugh at me . " <p> Her father goes still . " No one was laughing at you , " he says , and his voice is softer . " They were your friends . They were never laughing . " <p> Glynnis 's mother begins to cry , and her father reaches for her . But as his hand closes around her arm , she yanks away , and her paper cup tilts sideways , spilling red wine in an arch across the white carpet . Her mother looks down at the spill , then drops the cup to the floor and runs out of the room . <p> Glynnis and her father stand , staring down at the stain . " Go , " he says to Glynnis . " Go see if she 's all right . " <p> Glynnis looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there . She calls down the hallway and peeks around corners . She is about to go back to her father , about to tell him that her mother must have snuck out the back door , but then she passes the bathroom . The door is open a crack , and it is dark inside . As Glynnis edges the door open , a bar of light falls across the tile floor , and on the other side of the bathroom , she can make out the shape of her mother in the darkness , sitting in the bathtub . <p> As Glynnis creeps across the floor , the toe of her shoe catches on the silk of her mother 's bathrobe , which is lying like a dark puddle on the floor . Her mother sits with her knees pulled to her chest , naked in the empty bathtub . <p> " Mom ? " Glynnis whispers , but her mother is shaking , her head lowered over her bare knees . She does n't look up . " Mom , are you okay ? " <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make a sound . Her skin looks blue in the darkness , and her hair spills in messy tangles down the ridge of her spine . Glynnis stands , watching . Those are her mother 's hands , her mother 's ankles , her mother 's narrow shoulder blades . Glynnis has seen her mother 's body so many times that it is as familiar as her own . She knows every curve and angle , every knobby joint . But standing in the bathroom , Glynnis stares at her mother and feels nothing . She is a stranger . Glynnis has never seen her before in her life . She backs out of the room and closes the door , leaving her mother there , alone in the darkness . <p> When Glynnis walks back into the den , her father is on his hands and knees , scrubbing at the stain with a paper towel . The red wine is turning black on the carpet , and the paper towel is shredding into scraps as her father rubs harder and harder . That wo n't work , thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well ? " her father asks without looking up . <p> " She 's fine , " Glynnis says . " She just wants some time to herself . " Her father nods at the stain , and Glynnis kneels beside him . She watches his hand move across the spill , pressing the pieces of paper towel into the carpet , trying to mop up what has already been absorbed , trying to fix what will be there forever . <p> Outside there is the low rumble of a car pulling into the driveway , the slam of a car door . Glynnis leans her shoulder against her father 's and puts her hand over his . " The party , Daddy . Can I go ? " <p> Author Affiliation
