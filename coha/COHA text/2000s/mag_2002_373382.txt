You might think , after seeing the barrage of bad news about the major airlines , that the entire industry is going to be stuck on the tarmac by Thanksgiving . But far from all the chatter about bankruptcies and cutbacks , a few enterprising carriers are quietly soaring . Discount pioneer Southwest is readying its first transcontinental flights , from Baltimore , Md. , to Los Angeles , starting this fall , while New York City-based upstart JetBlue is adding more flights on the West Coast and in Florida . These and other discount carriers today account for 20% of domestic air travel , up from 10% in 1992 . <P> So why have n't American , United , US Airways and the three other full-service carriers , which lost $11 billion last year and stand to lose an additional $5 billion this year , followed the lead of the profitable discounters by cutting costs and fares ? Because that 's not the way their business works . They have made , and lost , their money by providing the frequent departures , quick connections , spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flyers and charging them dearly for that service  --  more than five times the cost of a discount fare . <P> It 's no wonder , then , that since 9/11 , which accelerated the worst downturn in U.S. aviation history , the major carriers have been whistling in the dark , waiting for their business to return to " normal . " But with US Airways ' move last week to seek bankruptcy protection , United 's warning that it was sliding that way and American 's announcement of " fundamental structural changes , " the majors as much as admitted that they ca n't wait any longer for the friendly skies to return . They have to start building a new business model  --  one focused on both leisure travelers and the growing ranks of business travelers who are mimicking their penny-pinching ways . <P> Recent events underscore how much more turbulence lies ahead for the beleaguered carriers as well as the disgruntled traveling public . Fares will drop on some routes and rise on others . More direct flights could open up , even as layovers grow longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , Calif. ) near metropolitan areas could see more traffic while service is reduced to smaller cities like Syracuse , N.Y. , and Greensboro , N.C. And forget those promises of more legroom in coach . Those days are over . <P> Rather than cause brief setbacks to the airline industry 's fortunes , 9/11 and the recession exposed a raft of deeper problems : high fixed costs , a convoluted fare structure , a boom in online bargain hunting by consumers and the growing disaffection of business travelers and their bosses . The full-service airlines ' soak-the-rich business model , which has always prized maximizing revenue over operational efficiency , looks all but busted . <P> Rebuilding it will be wrenching for an industry that collected a record $22.7 billion in profits from 1995 to 2000 . With the country enjoying an unprecedented economic boom , corporate travel managers were willing to pay the $2,000 walk-up fares for New York to Dallas or San Francisco to Miami . So it did n't matter how many vacationers were snapping up $400 deals to fly to Hawaii . From January 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to American Express Corporate Travel .
