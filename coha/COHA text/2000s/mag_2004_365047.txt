When Afghan authorities raided the house of a former Green Beret named Jonathan ( Jack ) Idema in Kabul last week , they were startled to find a makeshift prison . Inside were three Afghan prisoners hanging from their feet . Five more men were locked up and badly beaten . Another example of prison abuse by U.S. forces ? No , this do-it-yourself Abu Ghraib was a private jail being run by Idema and two other Americans who , along with several Afghan helpers , appear to have set themselves up as antiterrorist bounty hunters . " They pretended they were fighting terrorism , " said Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali , after the three Americans were arrested . " But they were outlaws . " <P> Idema , 47 , was well known to reporters in Kabul . Given to explosive bursts of rage and camouflage uniforms , he stalked Kabul 's few bars and foreign TV-news bureaus , punctuating his stories of chasing al-Qaeda with a flourish of his pistol . At least once he came up with the goods : a seven-hour al-Qaeda training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBS 's 60 Minutes . He hinted that he was working undercover for U.S. special forces and as a " special adviser " for Afghan authorities . But he was one of many shadowy , ex  --  special-operations types drawn to Afghanistan out of misguided patriotism or because of the prospect of fat rewards  --  the bounty on Osama bin Laden now exceeds $50 million , and that on Taliban chief Mullah Mohammed Omar $25 million . <P> The discovery of Idema 's prison came at a bad time for U.S. forces , who have faced charges of prison brutality in Afghanistan similar to those widely publicized in Iraq . Three Afghan prisoners have died while in custody , and several others were allegedly subjected to torture and sexual abuse . In Washington a U.S. State Department spokesman swiftly disavowed any official link to Idema 's gang , saying , " The U.S. government does not employ or sponsor these men . " For Idema , who officials say may face kidnapping charges in Afghanistan , the bounty-hunting days appear to be over . <P>  --  By Tim McGirk   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
