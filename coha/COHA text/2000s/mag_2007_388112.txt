. The wise man who said it 's the journey that counts obviously was n't a skier . The destination  --  soft , dry , cold blower , and lots of it  --  is clearly what matters . Few rituals are more important to skiers than the Road Trip . So last March we gave three writers a singular mission : Grab a friend ( or three ) and find the best stashes within a 900-mile radius of your starting point . They hauled an Airstream Basecamp trailer behind a Nissan truck over the Northwest , the Rockies , and the East Coast . They ate tortilla sandwiches , Hormel chili , and pickled eggs . They drank beer from cans and camped under the stars . All told , they logged 2,165 miles and 21 powder days . Take that , wise man . INTERMOUNTAIN WEST : UTAH , IDAHO , WYOMINGBY ROB STORY Dylan , Bill , and T.M. , three buddies from Telluride , met me in Salt Lake City , where we started a seven-day skiing blitz in a tank-sized truck , a never-used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , is the reason to road-trip . Like the mystery surrounding Dylan 's boots , a pair of Atomics with less than three months of wear . Dylan likes to think he made a karmic investment  --  that another size 7 found them in the Grand Targhee parking lot and is making good use of them . The rest of us figure a two-ton snowplow pounded Dylan 's Atomics into a million polyurethane smithereens . We do know the boots vanished because Dylan , 32 , was moon-eyed over Joey , 26 , a nursing student with a nose ring and a bewitching laugh . During an all-day snowcat-skiing session on the western slope of the Tetons , Dylan discovered that he and Joey had spent time at the same Oregon commune . Plus , she rips . Dylan 's infatuation grew with each powder run and flowered over several pitchers at the Trap Bar &; Grille . When it was time to say goodbye in the parking lot , Dylan put his boots down to hug Joey . She kissed him on the cheek . He walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour later . Targhee was the fourth and final stop on our swing through Utah , Idaho , and Wyoming . In Salt Lake City , the trailer dealer had assured us the tow-behind 's generator would be powered by the truck , and I , in a hazy brain cramp , believed him . Then we closed down Whiskey Jacques in Ketchum , Idaho , on a frigid , windy Friday night . Stumbling into the barely insulated metal box , I discovered that the sleeping bag I 'd borrowed was not a down sack rated to minus 15 , but a gossamer summer bag . I was condemned to brief bursts of sleep interrupted by violent shivering . And the vehicle sponsors probably do n't want to know about the Sun Chip crumbs littering the SUV 's floor , collecting in overturned bottle caps from Budweiser longnecks . Or the mess of frozen mud , jumbled skis , and wadded long underwear in the trailer . Nonetheless , our six-wheeled junk show ruled the tawny steppes of the Mountain West . We often gunned the truck 's V-8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plying I-15 . In your face , Winnebago . Between Snowbasin 's back side , the Tetons ' Glory Bowl , and secret stashes in Sun Valley , we skied powder every day .

All told , he reckons he 's driven " a couple hundred thousand miles " in his life . NORTHWEST AND CANADA : IDAHO AND BRITISH COLUMBIA BY TIM NEVILLE Tyson and I are at Whitewater Ski Area , outside of Nelson , BC , and there 's a furious cat driver screaming at us . Our loaded trailer is in the parking lot near the lodge , about a quarter mile from here , and our four-wheel-drive SUV is stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we 're on a green run next to a creek . Our attempts to get water have , well , grounded us . Sheepishly , we ask for a tow . Nelson is the second stop on our weeklong , 1,000-mile tour of the Northwest . And we do n't want to move , even if we could . We 've already laid boot-deep lines off the back side of Schweitzer , Idaho , and crossed the border for some thigh-deep untracked with Valhalla Powdercats near Nelson . Tomorrow we 're supposed to ski Whitewater in the morning , then hit Halcyon Hot Springs . In a few days , we 'll roll over Rogers Pass and snag first chair at Golden 's Kicking Horse before heading home . It 's an ambitious but doable plan that demands a strict schedule , which we would be keeping if it were n't for the French Canadian who persuaded us to stay at Whitewater a few more days before literally sending us up the creek . " We 're only here for a night , " I told Harold earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pouty frown and wrinkled nose . Harold 's been in the Whitewater parking lot for nearly a month , along with about six other squatters . Their makeshift community comprises Subarus and Toyota vans tricked out with plasma TVs , Xbox consoles , and drying racks . Our brand-new tin can and truck seem opulent . " Trop vite . " Harold said we were moving too fast . Then he added something about un joint . We decided to stay another night , kick back on the plywood benches in his bus ( a Greyhound-style two-toned beast with a pirate flag draped in the window ) , partake of the local agricultural staple , and drift into semiconscious bliss . And we freed our truck from the creek . Eventually we would go on to soak in Halcyon 's drowsy hot springwater , ogle massive avalanche paths gouging Rogers Pass , and flirt with a hot bartender in Golden . Her spunky friend would draw us a crude map to the best powder stashes at Kicking Horse , unprompted , and we 'd marvel at her friendliness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But get them out of their igloos and they 're like us : honest folks looking for good times . We learned this on our final morning at Whitewater , when the cat boss came by to scold us about driving on the slopes . " Do n't do that , " he said . Then he noticed the plates on our camper .

NEW ENGLAND : MAINE , NEW HAMPSHIRE , VERMONT BY GEORDIE BRACKIN It was raining when Pete and I picked up the prototype camper ( read : no insulation ) in an industrial suburb of Portland , Maine . It was March , and the snowpack hovered at 150 inches . Most skiers outside of New England would have slapped on storage wax and headed to Atlantic City by now . But I 'm an optimist . I had the road trip in my head , and I sold it to Pete with an undeniable pitch : For a week , we 'd live on wheels , drink hoppy microbrews , ski every day , and sleep wherever we damn well pleased . Wake up , walk to lift , ski till close . Repeat . Or that was the plan . But right now blood pours from my fattening lip , and I 've imprinted the shape of my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Tuckerman Ravine . Let me repeat : The . Run . Out . We did n't even tackle Tuck 's 50-degree , 750-foot glacial cirque off the east side of Mount Washington because of avalanche danger . So we skied to the Lunch Rocks , had a beer , and raced down the hiking path with Hahnenkamm enthusiasm on eggshell-thin slush and pancake ice . Mud flecked our boots , loose granular popped off our pant cuffs , and grass patches crept up everywhere . Jumping a flowing brook , I caught a ski tip and flopped ankles-over-ass into a sopping snowbank . Pete laid down a perfect tele turn and vanished around the bend . Still , our New England road trip is n't all brown , green , and red . Far from it . We were first in line for an eight-inch powder day at Jay and first to schralp fresh corduroy at Sugarloaf . We owned Cannon Mountain midweek . Miles from our desk jobs , we piloted the huge truck and trailer , gaining street cred by the day . Guys with trucker beards gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eyebrows , index finger off the steering wheel .

But we were shattered on St. Patrick 's Day when an earth mother in Vermont challenged us to a Irish car-bomb contest at the Snow Shoe Pub  --  and won . Even my crash in the woods works out . I pick myself up , double-check I 've got all my teeth , and click back into my skis . In the distance the grassy flanks of Wildcat are zebra-striped with man-made snow , and I swear I can see a few skiers . It 's enough to make me spend another night in our camper shell , on the road to another ski day , out of the rain .

If Tramline is torched , dip into Kinsman Glade , a 1,700-foot twist of a run that starts in tight evergreens but quickly opens into a mellower birch glade . APRES : The Lift Pub 's wooden deck , just below Peabody Quad , is your standard beer and acoustic-music venue . You can do better . Head down the block to Truant 's Tavern for 22-ounce Buds ( $2.25 ) , chain-smoking liberals , and shooting stick until last call .
