Two days before the shooting a chartered planeload of Southern Negroes swooped down upon the District of Columbia and attempted to see the Senator . They were all quite elderly : old ladies dressed in little white caps and white uniforms made of surplus nylon parachute material , and men dressed in neat but old-fashioned black suits , wearing wide-brimmed , deep-crowned panama hats which , in the Senator ' s walnut-paneled reception room now , they held with a grave ceremonial air . Solemn , uncommunicative and quietly insistent , they were led by a huge , distinguished-looking old fellow who on the day of the chaotic event was to prove himself , his age notwithstanding , an extraordinarily powerful man . Tall and broad and of an easy dignity , this was the Reverend A. Z. Hickman better known , as one of the old ladies proudly informed the Senator 's secretary , as " God 's Trombone . " This , however , was about all they were willing to explain . Forty-four in number , the women with their fans and satchels and picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags , they listened intently while Reverend Hickman did their talking . " Ma'am , " Hickman said , his voice deep and resonant as he nodded toward the door of the Senator 's private office , " you just tell the Senator that Hickman has arrived . When he hears who 's out here he 'll know that it 's important and want to see us . " " But I 've told you that the Senator is n't available , " the secretary said . " Just what is your business ? Who are you , anyway ? Are you his constituents ? " " Constituents ? " Suddenly the old man smiled . " No , miss , " he said , " the Senator does n't even have anybody like us in his state . We 're from down where we 're among the counted but not among the heard . " " Then why are you coming here ? " she said . " What is your business ? " " He 'll tell you , ma'am , " Hickman said . " He 'll know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him that we have arrived .. " The secretary , a young Mississippian , sighed . Obviously these were Southern Negroes of a type she had known all her life and old ones ; yet instead of being already in herdlike movement toward the door they were calmly waiting , as though she had n't said a word . And now she had a suspicion that , for all their staring eyes , she actually did n't exist for them . They just stood there , now looking oddly like a delegation of Asians who had lost their interpreter along the way , and were trying to tell her something which she had no interest in hearing , through this old man who himself did not know the language . Suddenly they no longer seemed familiar , and a feeling of dreamlike incongruity came over her . They were so many that she could no longer see the large abstract paintings hung along the paneled wall , nor the framed facsimiles of State Documents which hung above a bust of Vice-President Calhoun . Some of the old women were calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the droning air conditioner . Yet she could see no trace of impertinence in their eyes , nor any of the anger which the Senator usually aroused in members of their group . Instead , they seemed resigned , like people embarked upon a difficult journey who were already far beyond the point of no return . Her uneasiness grew ; then she blotted out the others by focusing her eyes narrowly upon their leader . And when she spoke again her voice took on a nervous edge . " I 've told you that the Senator is n't here , " she said , " and you must realize that he is a busy man who can only see people by appointment .. " " We know , ma'am , " Hickman said , " but ... " " You do n't just walk in here and expect to see him on a minute 's notice . " " We understand that , ma'am , " Hickman said , looking mildly into her eyes , his close-cut white head tilted to one side , " but this is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by long distance ? We 'd pay the charges . And I do n't even have to talk , miss ; you can do the talking . All you have to say is that we have arrived . " " I 'm afraid this is impossible , " she said . The very evenness of the old man 's voice made her feel uncomfortably young , and now , deciding that she had exhausted all the tried-and-true techniques her region had worked out ( short of violence ) for getting quickly rid of Negroes , the secretary lost her patience and telephoned for a guard . They left as quietly as they had appeared , the old minister waiting behind until the last had stepped into the hall , then he turned , and she saw his full height , framed by the doorway , as the others arranged themselves beyond him in the hall . " You 're really making a mistake , miss , " he said . " The Senator knows us and " " Knows you , " she said indignantly . " I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy who shines shoes at his golf club . " " Oh ? " Hickman shook his head as the others exchanged knowing glances . " Very well , ma'am . We 're sorry to have caused you this trouble . It 's just that it 's very important that the Senator know we 're on the scene . So I hope you wo n't forget to tell him that we have arrived , because soon it might be too late . " There was no threat in it ; indeed , his voice echoed the odd sadness which she thought she detected in the faces of the others just before the door blotted them from view . In the hall they exchanged no words , moving silently behind the guard who accompanied them down to the lobby . They were about to move into the street when the security-minded chief guard observed their number , stepped up , and ordered them searched . They submitted patiently , amused that anyone should consider them capable of harm , and for the first time an emotion broke the immobility of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the comic aspect of the situation . Here they were , quiet , old , and obviously religious black folk who , because they had attempted to see the man who was considered the most vehement enemy of their people in either house of Congress , were being energetically searched by uniformed security police , and they knew what the absurd outcome would be . They were found to be armed with nothing more dangerous than pieces of fried chicken and ham sandwiches , chocolate cake and sweet-potato fried pies . Some obeyed the guards ' commands with exaggerated sprightliness , the old ladies giving their skirts a whirl as they turned in their flat-heeled shoes . When ordered to remove his wide-brimmed hat , one old man held it for the guard to look inside ; then , flipping out the sweatband , he gave the crown a tap , causing something to fall to the floor , then waited with a callused palm extended as the guard bent to retrieve it . Straightening and unfolding the object , the guard saw a worn but neatly creased fifty-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it were hot . They watched silently as he looked at the old man and gave a dry , harsh laugh ; then as he continued laughing the humor slowly receded behind their eyes . Not until they were allowed to file into the street did they give further voice to their amusement . " These here folks do n't understand nothing , " one of the old ladies said . " If we had been the kind to depend on the sword instead of on the Lord , we 'd been in our graves long ago ai n't that right , Sis ' Arter ? " " You said it , " Sister Arter said . " In the grave and done long finished mold'ing ! " " Let them worry , our conscience is clear on that .... " " Amen ! " On the sidewalk now , they stood around Reverend Hickman , holding a hushed conference ; then in a few minutes they disappeared in a string of taxis and the incident was thought closed . Shortly afterwards , however , they appeared mysteriously at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to see him . How they knew of this secret suite they would not explain . Next they appeared at the editorial offices of the newspaper which was most critical of the Senator 's methods , but here too they were turned away . They were taken for a protest group , just one more lot of disgruntled Negroes crying for justice as though theirs were the only grievances in the world . Indeed , they received less of a hearing here than elsewhere . They were n't even questioned as to why they wished to see the Senator which was poor newspaper work , to say the least ; a failure of technical alertness , and , as events were soon to prove , a gross violation of press responsibility . So once more they moved away . Although the Senator returned to Washington the following day , his secretary failed to report his strange visitors . There were important interviews scheduled and she had understandably classified the old people as just another annoyance . Once the reception room was cleared of their disquieting presence they seemed no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes , liberal and reactionary alike , whenever the Senator made one of his taunting remarks . She forgot them . Then at about eleven a.m . Reverend Hickman reappeared without the others and started into the building . This time , however , he was not to reach the secretary . One of the guards , the same who had picked up the fifty-dollar bill , recognized him and pushed him bodily from the building . Indeed , the old man was handled quite roughly , his sheer weight and bulk and the slow rhythm of his normal movements infuriating the guard to that quick , heated fury which springs up in one when dealing with the unexpected recalcitrance of some inanimate object the huge stone that resists the bulldozer 's power , or the chest of drawers that refuses to budge from its spot on the floor . Nor did the old man 's composure help matters . Nor did his passive resistance hide his distaste at having strange hands placed upon his person . As he was being pushed about , old Hickman looked at the guard with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove his personal emotions to some far , cool place where the guard 's strength could never reach them . He even managed to pick up his hat from the sidewalk where it had been thrown after him with no great show of breath or hurry , and arose to regard the guard with a serene dignity . " Son , " he said , flicking a spot of dirt from the soft old panama with a white handkerchief , " I 'm sorry that this had to happen to you . Here you 've worked up a sweat on this hot morning and not a thing has been changed except that you 've interfered with something that does n't concern you . After all , you 're only a guard , you 're not a mind-reader . Because if you were , you 'd be trying to get me in there as fast as you could instead of trying to keep me out . You 're probably not even a good guard , and I wonder what on earth you 'd do if I came here prepared to make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present for the guard to risk giving the old fellow a demonstration . He was compelled to stand silent , his thumbs hooked over his cartridge belt , while old Hickman strolled or more accurately , floated up the walk and disappeared around the corner . Except for two attempts by telephone , once to the Senator 's office and later to his home , the group made no further effort until that afternoon , when Hickman sent a telegram asking Senator Sunraider to phone him at a T Street hotel . A message which , thanks again to the secretary , the Senator did not see . Following this attempt there was silence . During the late afternoon the group of closed-mouthed old folk were seen praying quietly within the Lincoln Memorial . An amateur photographer , a high-school boy from the Bronx , was there at the time and it was his chance photograph of the group , standing facing the great sculpture with bowed heads beneath old Hickman 's outspread arms , that was flashed over the wires following the shooting . Asked why he had photographed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as a " good composition .... I thought their faces would make a good scale of grays between the whiteness of the marble and the blackness of the shadows . " And for the rest of the day the group appears to have faded into those same peaceful shadows , to remain there until the next morning when they materialized shortly before chaos erupted .
