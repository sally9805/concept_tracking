Fairest By Gail Levine HarperCollins Publishers , Inc . Gail Levine I was born singing . Most babies cry . I sang an aria . Or so I believe . I have no one to tell me the truth of it . I was abandoned when I was a month old , left at the Featherbed Inn in the Ayorthaian village of Amonta . It was January 12th of the year of Thunder Songs . The wench who brought me to the inn paid for our chamber in advance and smuggled me in unseen . The next morning she smuggled herself out , leaving me behind . I know what happened next . Father and Mother -- the innkeeper and his wife -- have retold the tale on the anniversary of my arrival since I grew old enough to understand the words . " You were left in the Lark chamber , " Mother would say . " It was the right room for you , my songbird . " " It was a chill morning , " Father would chime in . " Soon you were howling . " His shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imilli . " We would all smile -- my younger sister Areida , my two older brothers , Mother , and I. Imilli was our cat -- kitten then . Mother would burst in . " I knew straight off you were a babe . I knew you were a singer , too . " She 'd sing , " It was all in your lovely howl . " We 'd laugh at that . She 'd shake her head . " No . Truly . It was lovely . " My favorite part would come next . Mother would throw back her head and imitate my howl , a high pure note . Ayortha is a kingdom of singers . In our family and in Amonta , my voice isthe finest . Mother often said that if I tried , I could sing the sun down from the sky . " I opened the chamber door , " Father would say , continuing the tale , " and there you were . " I was in the center of the bed , crying and kicking the air . " I picked you up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musical gurgle . " My brother Ollo would break in with his favorite part . " Your bottom was wet . " Areida would giggle . Father and Mother would never mention that the blanket I had arrived in was velvet , edged with gold thread . The story would go on . Mother carried me into the Sparrow room , where my brothers slept . Father headed for the attic to find Ollo 's old cradle . When he came down , I was lying on Ollo 's small bed while Ollo , who was two years old then , gently poked my cheek . No one has told me what happened next , but I know . I can imagine the sight I was . Yarry , who was five , would have spoken his mind , as he does to this day . He would have said , in a tone of wonder , " She 's so ugly . " Then -- they have told me this -- he said , " Can we keep her , Father ? " Father and Mother did , and named me Aza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently from their own children , and taught me to read music and songs from our treasured leather songbook , kept on its own high table in the entry parlor . I was an unsightly child . My skin was the weak blue-white of skimmed milk , which would n't have been so bad if my hair had been blond and my lips pale pink . But my lips were as red as a dragon 's tongue and my hair as black as an old frying pan . Mother always denied that I was ugly . She said that looking different was n't the same as looking amiss , and she called me her one-of-a-kind girl . Still , she promised I 'd grow prettier as I grew older . I remember asking her a dozen times a day if I was prettier yet . She would stop whatever she was doing -- cleaning a guest 's chamber or bathing Areida -- and consider me . Then she 'd sing , " I think so . " But soon after , one of the inn 's guests would stare , and I 'd know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I became uglier . I grew large boned and awkward . My chubby cheeks were fine for a babe , but not for an older child . I resembled a snow maid , with a big sphere of a face and round button eyes . I ached to be pretty . I wished my fairy godmother would come and make me so . Mother said we all have fairy godmothers , but they rarely reveal themselves . I wished I could see mine . I was sure fairies were supremely beautiful and glorious in every way . Mother said fairy godmothers only watch from afar and sympathize . I did n't see the good of a hand-wringing fairy godmother . I needed one who 'd fly in and help . With no hope for fairy intervention , I wished for a magic spell to make me pretty . At night I 'd sing nonsense words to myself after Areida had fallen asleep . I thought I might stumble on the right combination of syllables and notes , but I never did . I attempted to make myself more presentable by pinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying a ribbon around my neck . Once , I sneaked into Father 's workshop and smeared wood stain on my face and arms . The results were streaky brown skin and a rash that lasted a month . The inn 's guests were sometimes friendly , but more often they were rude . As bad as the ones who stared were the ones who looked away in embarrassment . Some guests did n't want me to serve their food , and some did n't want me to clean their rooms . We Ayorthaians are sensitive to beauty , more sensitive than the subjects in other kingdoms , I think . We love a fine voice especially , but we also admire a rosy sunset , a sweet scent , a fetching face . And when we 're not pleased , we 're displeased . I developed the habit of holding my hand in front of my face when guests arrived , a foolish practice , because it raised curiosity and concealed little . Mother and Father mostly gave me chores that kept me out of sight , helping the laundress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was common sense , too . I was bad for business .
