LAST JANUARY , MY CHINESE TEACHER , Mr. Wen , told me he was planning to travel to Guangzhou , the southern Chinese city where he 'd lived for most of his life until emigrating to the U.S. Mr. Wen is 74 , and I knew he had not set foot outside of New York for almost eight years . " I love Guangzhou more than any place , " he told me , beaming . I understand how a city can become part of your heart , and I wished him well on his trip . But inside I worried . I had been to Guangzhou just a year ago and knew that in the years since my teacher had lived there , extensive urban development had transformed the centuries-old river port . Today , Guangzhou is a glass-and-concrete boom town of traffic-choked freeways and busy subways . The Guangzhou East station , from which trains packed with businessmen shuttle to and from Hong Kong , had n't existed when Mr. Wen left town . Neither had the surrounding neighborhood of shops and cubelike apartment complexes whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of pink and aqua . I tried to imagine how Mr. Wen would feel , alighting from that train station into a Guangzhou that looks like Houston . Actually , I did n't have to imagine very hard , since I 've been traveling long and far enough to have experienced the shock of reencounter , after years of separation , with a favorite place I thought I knew very well . There was , for instance , my return to the paradisical beach in Tobago where I 'd camped about 20 years ago , for free , in a tent borrowed from one of the small community of surf bums who lived in that spot every season because it has some of the most enjoyable waves in that part of the Caribbean . I remembered swinging out over the ocean on a tire attached to a rope that someone hung from an overhanging palm as the surfers paddled out to the waves . At night we 'd fry kingfish for dinner , and sometimes one of the teenagers from the village , a Rasta kid named Tony , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the campfire . My time at the surfer camp did n't change the facts of my life-when I jumped on my return flight to New York I was still 26 , unemployed , and broke . But when reality started to bite , later at home , I could fight it back with thoughts of the beach and Tony 's " No Woman , No Cry . " It took me more than a decade to make it back to Tobago , by which time the surfers had long moved on . The beach had a new look-raked , manicured , and populated by pink-skinned guests at a resort hotel that had sprung up since my beach camp days . Bummer , I thought , but my depression lifted a little when I ran into Tony in the nearby village and learned that he and many of his formerly unemployed neighbors had good jobs at this hotel . I 'm not foolish or selfish enough to believe that all development is bad , or that a pristine Caribbean beach will remain empty for 20 years simply because I wish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard evidence of the passage of time , to see with your own eyes that something you treasured no longer exists . And-even harder-to see that you 've changed , too . For at that point , ten years later , I would n't have dreamed of trading a hotel bed for beach sand . Choose to go back to a place you 've already traveled , and you run the risk of feeling the ache of loss and change , which is why many travelers think twice and twice again about retracing tracks . Some people make a fetish out of never returning to a place , but I do n't think I could ever keep that game up . The world is too small , and I am too curious . Visiting a country for a week or a month is like reading a chapter in a novel-in-progress , and I always want to dive back in every now and again to see how the story is coming along . Going back to the ancient temple town of Madurai , in India , I painlessly slipped back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked my shoes at the door of the massive stone Hindu temple complex . Had Madurai changed ? Probably , but at a level of detail not visible to an occasional visitor . Another way to blunt the shock of returning is to visit and revisit a place so frequently that you 're always abreast of its changes . I have friends who have this sort of travel relationship with Paris-they always know which bakeries are producing the most perfect croissants on the planet and which have lost their pizzazz . I have a relationship like this with Miami Beach , a city that I 've been passing through three or four times a year since 1988 . I 've watched it evolve from a little strip of faded art deco hotels on an empty beach to a traffic-choked city of highrises . I 'm not entirely happy about all of Miami Beach 's changes , but because I 've been around to watch them slowly take place , at least they do n't freak me out when I go there . There are destinations that become so much a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of encounter , that the act of returning-no matter how soon or how long the absence-simply serves to deepen the relationship , cement an unconditional bond . When Mr. Wen returns from his trip to Guangzhou , I ask him how it went . " Very wonderful , " he says excitedly . But what did he make of all the changes to the city ? " Guangzhou is modern now . Before it was old . It has tall buildings , new rail lines-all very good for Guangzhou . " Did n't all those glass boxes and freeways make you a tiny bit sad ? Maybe the changes are good for Guangzhou , but how do you feel about them ? These questions stall on the tip of my tongue , for at the moment I want to speak them , Mr. Wen suddenly declares : " In another ten years I will visit Guangzhou again . And I will stay .
