<p> Stooped in her wheelchair , the patient grumbles about the pain , the cold , her age , her world . <p> " Some nights I 'm screaming in agony , " she says . " You got ta help me , doc . " <p> Dr. Stanley Wainapel sizes up the problem immediately . Arthritis has eaten away one 71-year-old knee and is gnawing at the other . The prospect of surgery terrifies her . <p> Wainapel checks the movement in the patient 's arms and legs , prods the left knee until it hurts . " You 're made of pretty sturdy stuff , " he tells Myra Edelstein , walking back to his desk . " You should come through the surgery fine . " <p> His voice is reassuring , but he 's looking in the wrong direction . <p> " Hey , doc ! , " Edelstein yells . " I 'm over here , doc . " <p> Wainapel straightens his gaze with a slightly embarrassed smile . As Edelstein is leaving she notices a thin white cane , propped beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind ! " she exclaims . " My doctor is blind . " <p> With his thick silver hair and silver-rimmed glasses , his staff jokes that Wainapel looks like Andy Warhol . He cuts a striking figure as he strides through the hospital , white coat flapping , white cane tapping out a path in front : past cabinets and counters and bewildered onlookers who quickly step out of his way . <p> Sometimes he bumps into patients . Sometimes he bumps into walls . And some days Wainapel , the 54-year-old clinical director of rehabilitation at Montefiore Medical Center , has to reassure himself as much as his patients that he was right to choose medicine as his career . <p> " You need a lot more than eyes , " he says , " to be a good physician . " <p> Montefiore is an overwhelming place , even for those who can see . Cabs and buses loaded with patients stream up Gun Hill Road , disgorging a swirling human mass that can make it seem as if all the broken bones and sick hearts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skillfully negotiating his way through the chaos , is the doctor many have come to see , the blind piano-playing doctor who introduces patients to Mozart and Chopin even as he prods joints and listens to hearts and diagnoses disease . <p> Some patients swear the blind doctor sees their pain better than anyone . <p> " He does n't judge you from the outside , because he ca n't see the outside , " says Maria Asuncion Diaz , a 42-year-old nurse who is being treated for complications related to Lyme disease . " Because of his blindness , I think he really hears what you have to say . " <p> Diaz is wearing a spotted hospital gown and sitting on a bed . In a few moments , Dr. Wainapel , who studied acupuncture in China , will stick 14 needles into her hands , feet and neck . Diaz does n't worry about him finding the right pressure points : It 's the spots of blood she must wipe away on her own that bother her . <p> Wainapel knew from childhood that he would eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the retina and of cells in the back of the eye . <p> He knew he had to fill his " memory library " before his eyes stopped working . So he did . <p> He traveled . He read . He took photographs : His favorite , taken 25 years ago in the Swiss Alps , is blurry and impressionistic and it is proudly hung above his desk . He played chamber music : Other musicians marveled at his ability to sight read . <p> And , although his parents tried to persuade him that life as a blind piano player might be easier than life as a blind physician , he went to Boston University School of Medicine . It seemed an obvious choice for the son of a doctor and nurse , even though Wainapel knew he could never hop in a car and make house calls , as his father had done . <p> " I could n't be a surgeon , " Wainapel says . " But no physician is master of everything . " While in medical school he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started practicing , his peripheral vision was fading . <p> So Wainapel specialized in physiatry , in the healing and rehabilitation of patients with all sorts of ailments : lower back pain , hip replacements , carpal tunnel syndrome , chronic fatigue . He sees up to 200 patients a month . Not once , Wainapel says , has a patient been unnerved enough at his blindness to request another physician . <p> In fact , he says , patients can often be more accepting than peers , who sometimes see only the cane . <p> For years he fought using the cane , and the talking books , and the voice-activated computer that he now relies on to scan reports and write memos and read medical literature . He avoided anything that marked him as a doctor with a disability . After all , doctors are n't supposed to be defective . Patients are . <p> And then he reminds himself , as he reminds anyone who asks , that you do n't need sight to feel the curve of a spine . " And what is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmur ? " he says . " You close your eyes . " <p> But , like any doctor , Wainapel has had emergencies when , despite all his confidence and training , he wondered if he was up to the job . <p> A couple of years ago , when the Heimlich maneuver did n't work on a relative who was choking , Wainapel was sure he would have to perform the first tracheotomy of his life . " It 's just a question of knowing where to cut , " he said . " It would n't have been pretty , but I could have done it . " <p> Fortunately , the operation was not necessary . <p> In the past decade , Wainapel 's central vision has deteriorated to the point that he can no longer read , and patients seem no more than shadows when they sit across his desk . For all his assurance and acceptance , there are days when the loss has seemed unbearably cruel . Wainapel has raged at the fact he can no longer sight-read music . And he knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their quest to adopt a Chinese baby , he will never see the child 's face . <p> Still , these days Wainapel is more at ease talking about his blindness . He does n't care when patients gasp at the huge black sprawl on their prescriptions : most doctors ' prescriptions are illegible anyway , he jokes . And he proudly shows them his Typoscope , a thin plastic wedge that he uses to mark the spot for his signature . <p> But he does n't do injections anymore . His secretary speed-reads his mail aloud . And he ca n't read X-rays . <p> Minor inconveniences , says his longtime friend , Dr. Avital Fast , chairman of the department . " In our society there is a huge stigma to being disabled , " Fast says . " And by voluntarily taking on that stigma every time he uses his cane , Stanley becomes an inspiration to others with disabilities . " <p> Inam Rihan , a 38-year-old mother of six , suffers from lower back pain and a thyroid disorder . After Wainapel has diagnosed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for her to read . <p> " You do n't have to see in order to read , " Wainapel said excitedly , pulling out his latest book-on-tape : " The Shipping News " by E. Annie Proulx . " I read all the time . " <p> By the time she leaves , Rihan is armed with all sorts of information for the visually impaired , including numbers for Wainapel 's own ophthalmologist and the National Library Service for the Blind . She 's also been introduced to violinist Oskar Shumsky , whose music plays softly throughout her visit . <p> Other patients are introduced to Dickens : Wainapel has written about the English author 's penchant for disabled heroes in his novels . Or to Beethoven : Wainapel has written about the effect of the musician 's deafness on his talent . <p> Wainapel rarely gives piano recitals anymore , but that has more to do with a tight schedule than with blindness . <p> And then some days , when there is a lull between patients , he tap-taps his way upstairs to the hospital community room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic flowers on the tables . Most in the audience , a dozen or so elderly patients in wheelchairs , are dozing . <p> Suddenly , a Chopin polonaise fills the room , soft and enchanting and so otherworldly that nurses pause on their rounds to listen and patients take a break from their pain . For fifteen minutes on a busy morning , the blind piano-playing doctor creates a little piece of wonder in Montefiore.
