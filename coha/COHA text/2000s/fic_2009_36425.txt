Tension was high around the table , but then , there were thousands of dollars strewn out across the board , represented by colorful plastic chips . <p> Because this was Vegas , where men and women could rise like meteors to the top of the world , then plummet to the bottom just as quickly . <p> Jessy Sparhawk could feel the pressure , could feel the eyes of the other gamblers on her . <p> Some people were playing big money . <p> Others  --  idiots like herself  --  were taking a desperate , edgy , ridiculous chance , playing to beat the odds . To defy the gods of Vegas , who always proclaimed that the house won . <p> Oh , yes , she was an idiot . Why in God 's name had she taken the last of her savings to the craps table ? She worked in Vegas , she had grown up out here . She 'd seen the down-and-outers . She 'd seen the poor , the pathetic , the alcoholics , the junkies , all trying for a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ten , baby , roll a hard ten " a man called from the end of the table . He was n't one of the down-and-outers . He was a regular all over town . She had seen him over at the Big Easy , and he had a deep Southern accent , but one with a Texas twang . His name was Coot Calhoun . All right , so his real name probably was n't Coot , but that was how he was known . Nice man . He 'd inherited one of the biggest oil fields in Texas . She liked him . He had a wife named Minnie  --  though Jessy was doubtful about that name , too  --  who he genuinely loved , and he tipped well because he was generous , not because he was expecting any favors . <p> " I 'm trying , Coot , I 'm trying , " she assured him , praying for a hard ten not for Coot 's sake but for Tim 's . <p> She was here , gambling at the Vegas Sun , because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which usually did n't bother her , since she was n't a gambler . The Sun was owned by a billionaire who had been in the casino trade a long time . Her own Big Easy was owned by Emil Landon . A rich man , yes . A very rich man . But he had n't been at the casino game long . Even though she was n't a gambler , she knew the games . She 'd been a dealer , a hostess , a waitress , a bartender , a singer , a dancer  --  even an acrobat for a brief period of time . She knew Vegas in and out , backward and forward , and she had learned long , long ago , not to gamble , because the house always won . <p> " Baby , baby , baby , bee-you-ti-ful baby , do it . Hard ten , " another man called . He was young . Drunk . Probably had too much money on the board , and definitely had too much alcohol in his system . <p> She was aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fun at first , but now she felt the tension . Even Darrell Frye , one of the Sun 's pit bosses , was watching her with a measuring stare , as if afraid she was on one of those long rolls that totally outweighed the odds . <p> " Ten , ten , ten , " a nearby woman repeated fervently . She was haggard looking , thin , and her dress had been stylish twenty years ago , back when she had been pretty . Now her features bore the weight of time , but she offered Jessy a smile , and Jessy smiled back . <p> " Get on with it , " someone else insisted . " Just roll . " <p> She did . To her horror , the dice bounced off the table . <p> " Hey , it 's all right , just a game , " said a deep , smooth , masculine voice . <p> She looked up . The man who had spoken was several people away to her left , and she had noticed him earlier . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't typically handsome , and certainly not a pretty boy , but he had what she could only call presence . Tall , with broad shoulders , he managed to be simultaneously casual and elegant , and rugged on top of that . <p> She flashed him a smile . He was n't drunk ; he had been sipping the same drink since she had started watching the table . She was five-ten and wearing heels , but he towered over her by several inches . His eyes were so dark that to call them brown would be an injustice . His hair , too , was almost ebony , and the striking cut of his cheekbones made her think there had to be Native American blood in his background , and maybe not far back . He was simply striking , dressed in a white pin-striped shirt open at the neck , a nicely fitted jacket and black jeans . He had n't been risking big money , but he had played as if he knew something about the game , and he 'd been playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be watching for more than just the roll of the dice . <p> He lifted his glass to her and looked over at the dealer as he tossed out two hundred-dollar chips . " Hard ten for me and for the roller , " he said . <p> " You do n't need to  --  " she began . <p> " Jessy , just roll , sweetie , " Coot called to her , then turned to the croupier as he picked up two chips himself . " My money is on the little lady . Throw this on the hard ten , one for me , one for her , please . " <p> His hundreds went down . <p> More chips were thrown down on the hard ten , plenty of them for her , and she knew that she was blushing . " Thanks , " she murmured , looking at the man who had started it all . The pressure was really on now . A so-called " hard " bet paid really well . <p> But there was a lot of money to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do n't worry . It 's going to be a hard ten . And if it 's not , it 's all right . I never put down what I ca n't afford to lose . " <p> She wished she could say the same thing . But at this point , she was desperate . If she did n't come up with the money , she could n't pay to keep Timothy in the home . She could see Mr. Hoskins ' face now , as he calmly told her , " I 'm sorry , Miss Sparhawk , but there 's nothing we can do . I 've been as patient as I can , but if I do n't have that three thousand dollars by tomorrow morning , you 'll have to find another facility . " <p> She hated Hoskins . He was a thin-lipped , nose-in-the-air jerk , but he only ran the Hawthorne Home ; he was n't the one who spent time with Tim . And Tim loved Jimmy Britin , the orderly , and Liz Freeze , his nurse . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked at the home in order to be able to afford to donate his time at several local shelters . <p> A hard ten . If she rolled a hard ten , two fives , she made not just her own hundred-dollar bet , but ten times that hundred . Plenty of money to keep Timothy where he needed to be . <p> She swallowed hard and rolled the dice . <p> " Hard ten , hard ten ! " It became a chant . <p> She had never seen dice roll for so long on a craps table . A four and a threeand groans went around the table , because a seven meant that she would crap out . But the dice were still rolling . <p> A five and a three . <p> A five and a two . <p> A five and <p> A five . A hard ten . <p> The screaming and shouting was deafening . Hands clapping , high fives all around . She was n't sure who picked her up and swung her around , but she did n't protest that any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , or even Coot 's enthusiastic kiss on her cheek . She was simply too stunned . <p> The one man who did n't grab her or go insane was the tall , dark-haired stranger . He just watched her , pleased , and yet somehow grave . <p> Jessy could n't believe the number of chips coming her way . <p> " I 'm cashing in , " she told the dealer . <p> He gave her an odd look . " You 're still rolling , " he reminded her . " If you leave , these folks will lynch me . Do n't pass the roll . Go until you crap out . " <p> She glanced to the side , looking for the dark-haired stranger . <p> He was gone ; of course . He was n't rolling . Still , she missed him . And she had the oddest feeling that things were n't going to go right , now that he was gone . And she was right , because it was n't long until she crapped out . Still , as she collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three thousand dollars she needed , everyone regaled her as if she were a celebrity . She thanked them , then turned , eager to escape as quickly as possible . <p> That was when the huge man plowed into her . <p> Huge . Bodyguard huge . He was bald and built like a wall of solid rock . His eyes were hazel and streaked with red . <p> " Hey ! " Coot yelled indignantly . <p> It did n't stop the man , who hit her so hard that he knocked her flat onto the craps table , then fell on top of her . <p> She was pinned , and when she tried to budge his weight , she could n't . She started to ask the onlookers for assistance , but her words were cut short by someone 's shrill , hysterical scream . <p> And then she felt the blood trickling down on her as she struggled under the man 's weight . <p> His dead weight <p> His glazed and frozen eyes stared at her , and then his mouth moved . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And then his lips stopped moving and something , some light , went out in his eyes . <p> She tried to twist out from beneath him , and that was when she saw the knife sticking out of his back , saw the blood , and began to scream herself . <p> Dillon Wolf heard the screams just seconds after he had stepped into the special " high-roller " section of the casino . He spun around , returning at a breakneck speed , and arrived back at the craps table just as casino security descended on it . He saw the beautiful redhead he 'd staked earlier , desperately trying to push the weight of the huge man off her , and he saw the man 's face almost as quickly . <p> Tanner Green . Hell . <p> He 'd spent most of the night keeping track of who was coming and going , trying to get a handle on who was frequenting the new casino , and the last damn thing he 'd imagined was Green turning up dead . The man was a pro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoining the world , he 'd worked as a mercenary ; there was no way in hell he should have been taken by surprise by anyone . But a knife in the back ? That pretty much screamed surprise . <p> The fact that the police would want the body left in situ did n't prevent him from diving in to help the redhead free herself as quickly as possible . <p> " Hey , hey ! " one of the security officers said , hurrying forward , but he ignored the man . <p> " Thank you , " the redhead whispered as he shifted her free of the corpse and she managed to get back on her feet . For a moment , though , her eyes were on his . Huge . A deep , radiant blue , like a cloudless sky . Those eyes had first met his just a few minutes earlier as she rolled the dice . Now he also noticed that she smelled good , not to mention that she felt good against him . <p> As soon as he saw that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presenting it to the security officer . <p> " Dillon Wolf , licensed P.I. , " he said . " Have the police been called ? " <p> " The 911 has gone in , they 'll be here momentarily , " the security officer said . Two of the men accompanying him had already begun to form an invisible ring around the craps table ; two more were hurrying over to bar the door . <p> " Oh God , I have to get out of here . I have to get out of here ! " a woman cried hysterically . <p> " Calm down , " Dillon said , his voice taking on a deep authoritative pitch . He had long ago learned that people did n't obey high voices in an emergency ; they only became more hysterical . <p> The redhead was silent , but he saw that she was shivering . Something in her eyes told him that she knew she was going to be there for a long time , the center of a murder investigation . She was stunning , absolutely stunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of gorgeous women , of course  --  showgirls , waitresses , actresses , singers  --  but she seemed different somehow . <p> When he 'd first noticed her , those eyes of hers had been haunted . Not as if she was afraid of losing a dream , certainly not as if she was afraid of simply losing money , but as if she was terrified of losing something far more precious . As if the roll of the dice could cost her her very soul . <p> He gave himself a mental shake . He had other things to think about here . Not only was there a dead man lying on the craps table , but that dead man was Tanner Green . <p> A man came striding onto the scene . A big guy with an attitude . Jerry Cheever , Las Vegas homicide . Dillon was pretty sure that Cheever resented him , but Cheever knew the lay of the land . He might despise Dillon on every level , but he 'd been told by his bosses that Dillon was to be granted free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he obeyed , but he also liked to take credit for things that went well , and he knew Dillon had a talent for seeing an investigation through , and he was n't above taking advantage of that fact . <p> Especially because he simply was n't the sharpest knife in the drawer . <p> " No one move ! " Cheever bellowed . " And I mean no one ! " <p> He took note of the blood seeping into the green felt tabletop and soaking the multicolored chips . <p> " Wolf , " he said curtly , acknowledging Dillon 's presence . His eyes settled on the redhead as he asked Dillon , " What happened ? " <p> " I was n't here . I ran over when I heard the screaming , " Dillon said . <p> Jerry Cheever turned to the redhead . <p> " What happened ? " he demanded curtly . <p> " I was leaving the table . This man came over and and fell on me , " she said . <p> " Do you know him ? " Cheever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> " You 're sure ? " Cheever pressed . <p> " Absolutely sure , " she said with confidence . She was still trembling slightly . Not surprising , Dillon thought , given that she was wearing the dead man 's blood . <p> " Are you hurt ? " he asked her quietly . <p> She shook her head . <p> Cheever took in the corpse . " Christ ! It 's Tanner Green . " He glared at Dillon again . " Are n't you two working for  --  " <p> " Yes , " Dillon said curtly . <p> " But you were n't together ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Lieutenant Cheever , the M.E. is here , " a newly arrived police officer informed him . <p> " Give him room . No one gets out those doors , do you hear ? " Cheever said . <p> A murmur arose from the crowd , but Cheever was n't disturbed . " Give your payouts , close your tables , " he commanded the casino employees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men posted at all the doors . No one leaves here without presenting ID and a valid local address , and not until they 've been questioned . Are we understood ? " <br> Continues ...
