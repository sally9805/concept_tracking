<p> John Cudia and Kathy Voytko celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary together on a recent Thursday night . Both were in the arms of another person . <p> Such is the life for married actors who are in separate shows . <p> " We both celebrated it the Monday before , " Voytko says . " Sometimes , you have to fudge the actual date . " <p> Voytko is currently playing the role of Clara in Stephen Sondheim 's chamber musical " Passion , " which finishes its run today at Chicago Shakespeare Theater . Cudia is portraying the title character in Andrew Lloyd Webber 's " The Phantom of the Opera " at the Cadillac Palace Theatre . <p> Cudia and Voytko first met while they were respectively understudying the roles of Raoul and Christine in a production of " The Phantom of the Opera . " While the opulent and romantic hit music from Andrew Lloyd Webber has no doubt brought many a couple together , Cudia and Voytko say the show was n't the source of the romance , but rather just the circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , " Cudia says . " We could have been cast in a terrible tragedy and if we had been put together in the same room we would have hit it off . " <p> " We were both in rehearsals together for our roles and both kept doing pratfalls to crack the other person up , " Voytko adds . " It was completely contrary to how our characters were supposed to behave and we both recognized some kindred silliness in each other . " <p> Unlike the Phantom character he plays , Cudia resisted the urge to drop a chandelier on the competition and instead behaved as a perfect gentleman . <p> " It was obvious to me that we were hitting it off , but she was involved and I did n't want to get in the way . " <p> The pair dated for four years before their marriage . For most of their married life Voytko and Cudia have found themselves separated due to various touring productions . <p> " The one good thing I will say is that when you do finally see each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cudia says . <p> Now that they 're in the same city for a couple of months , Voytko says she ca n't wait to do the things most couples take for granted . <p> " Just to be able to walk the dog together is going to be great , " Voytko says . <p> " Or go out to dinner , " Cudia adds . " You know , the normal things . " <p> Cudia is starring opposite Sara Jean Ford in the Webber musical . As the Phantom is teacher to Christine , Ford also could learn a thing or two about actors and relationships from Cudio . <p> The actress is dating Drew Gehling , who plays Bob Gaudio in " Jersey Boys . " <p> The pair met at Carnegie Mellon University . Ford counts herself lucky for falling for Gehling . <p> " There were seven students in the musical theater class and Drew was the only straight boy , " she says , laughing . <p> Like her " Phantom " co-star , Ford has spent much time apart from her boyfriend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Disneyland in California while she joined the original Chicago company of " Wicked . " <p> " Though it was kind of cool to tell people I was dating Prince Charming , the distance got to be a bit much , " Ford says . <p> Ford and Gehling 's system is never spending more that four weeks apart . <p> " We 're fortunate that in our business we both have Mondays off , " Gehling says . " At the moment , neither of our shows have Sunday night performances , either . So , we 're able to fly out on Sunday night and stay with each other until Tuesday morning . " <p> " Sometimes , we do n't even wait four weeks , " Ford adds . <p> " Sometimes it 's every other week . We 're lame like that , " Gehling says . <p> Ford figures that most of her salary from " Wicked " was spent on flying out to see Gehling on tour in " Jersey Boys . " <p> " People ca n't believe that I would fly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " To me , it 's worth it . " <p> In addition to being able to spend more time with each other , Ford and Gehling plan on seeing more family and friends , too . <p> " We 're officially known to our family and friends as a ' two-fer , ' " Ford says . " It 's only in Chicago where you can see both Drew and I in our shows . " <p> " When you date or marry another actor , there is an inherent conflict involved , " says Michael Ingersoll , currently seen as Nick Massi in the Chicago production of " Jersey Boys " opposite Gehling . Ingersoll also is married , to actress Angela Ingersoll . " You want your partner to succeed at everything they do , but you know that success will often entail them leaving you for periods of time . " <p> Like Cudia and Voytko , the Ingersolls met on the stage ; they were asked to prepare the marriage proposal scene from " The Importance of Being Earnest " for a regional theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own marriage proposal scene . When Michael took on the role of Massi in the national tour of " Jersey Boys , " it was the first time the couple were apart for a length of time . <p> " We resisted living apart until we had to , " Michael Ingersoll says . " It was such a significant job for me , I could n't pass it up . " <p> " Chicago was the first place that felt like home to both of us , so it was n't a stretch for me to say yes to staying here while he went on the road , " adds Angela Ingersoll , who was nominated for a Jefferson Award for her role as Martha in Porchlight Music Theatre 's 2006 production of " The Secret Garden . " This past spring , she originated the role of Riley in Chicago Shakespeare Theatre 's hit children 's show " How Can You Run With a Shell on Your Back ?

And , beginning Dec. 12 , she will be appearing in the Apple Tree Theatre 's production of the fringe musical favorite " The Mistress Cycle " as the infamous author Anais Nin . <p> Dating someone in the same profession does have its perks . " Being on the road , you might hit springtime and springtime allergies six months in a row , " Voytko says . " When I 'm not talkative , he knows it 's because I 'm trying to save my voice . " <p> " There are times when auditions do n't go the way you want , and having a spouse who 's an actor gives you a support system , " Cudia says . <p> The Ingersolls say it helps to look at both careers jointly . <p> " It is n't a competition . Now that Michael 's life is more normal thanks to the long run , I can take more career risks , " Angela Ingersoll says . <p> " And I 'm here to support her , " Michael Ingersoll adds . <p> Each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than perfect circumstances by keeping a line of communication open . <p> " When you 're talking to an answering machine , you soon start to feel like you 're in a relationship with a machine , " Voytko says . " Make sure to say good morning and good night to each other . " <p> " You have to trust that the other is behaving as if you are there standing next to them , " Cudia says . <p> The Ingersolls put technology to work for them . <p> " Laptops and Webcams are wonderful , " Angela Ingersoll says . " We made it a point to always make and eat dinner with each other even when we were in different cities . " <p> " We also saved our days off and would come see the other person whenever we could , " Michael Ingersoll adds . " But the iChat dinners gave us a sense of normalcy in between those visits .

" But I 'm more glad to have a smack of reality in the middle of it . " <p> As for what the future holds for the couples , Cudia and Voytko just might end up taking a cue from the Ingersolls . <p> " Kathy has spent three years working in local theaters and we both adore the Chicago theater community , " Cudia says . <p> " We still have a home in New Jersey , " Voytko adds . " Everything is just a little friendlier here and we may stick around for a little while longer . " <p> Gehling says he and Ford are considering setting up house in Chicago , too . <p> " In New York , you have to leave town to work , " Gehling says . " But in Chicago , you can actually make a living as an actor and still have a family and be a real person . "
