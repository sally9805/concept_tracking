Here 's what you need to know : I hate lines . That 's the only reason I stopped by Roscoe 's that day . I would explain this to the guys from Robbery-Homicide , not that LAPD ever believes a word I say . But it 's the truth . Any other day , if I had swung by Roscoe 's Chicken N ' Waffles on Gower and Sunset , there would have been customers waiting in the plastic chairs lining the sidewalk , hoping for a table inside , out of the sun 's reach . Me , I would have driven straight by . I love Roscoe 's , but what did I just say ? I hate lines . Lines are an occupational hazard for actors looking for work , so I seriously hate lines on my days off . Maybe it was because it was ten-forty-five on a Monday morning  --  too late for breakfast and too early for lunch  --  but the sidewalk outside Roscoe 's was empty , so I pulled over to grab some food . Chance . Happenstance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accident . As anybody in this town knows , some people give off a magnetic field . A few lucky ones have it naturally ; and some , like me , have worked on it over time . A certain walk , the right clothes , a strategic combination of aloofness and familiarity . When I walk into a room , strangers ' eyes fix on me like a calculus problem they ca n't solve : I know you from somewhere . You must be somebody , what's-his-name on TV , or Whozit , from that movie thatjust came out . Being noticed has always been an important part of my work  --  hell , half the people in L.A. moved here hoping to refine the art of being noticed , with no cost too high . By now , it 's second nature . Customers looked up from their plates and lowered their voices when I walked into Roscoe 's . Later , half a dozen people would describe me down to the shoes I was wearing : white suede Bruno Magli loafers . Bone-colored light ribbed sweater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you ask six people for a description , you get six different stories . Not this time . One seventy-six-year-old grandmother at a table in the back had the nerve to tell the cops , " I do n't think he was wearing anything under those tight white pants . " I 'm not lying . And she was right . They noticed me , down to religious preference . But as I walked through the door of Roscoe 's , I tripped over someone else 's magnetic field . The air in that place was crackling , electrified . It made the hair on my neck and arms stand up . Remember that scene in Pulp Fiction when those two small-timers tried to hold up a diner , not knowing the customers included Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta , stone-cold killers there for a quick breakfast after blowing away three dumb-ass kids ? Well , either somebody was about to hold up Roscoe 's at gunpoint , or someone close to royalty was eating there . Had to be one or the other . " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the cash register . " Everything cool , man ? " " Cool as a Monday 's gon na be . " Gabe looked busy , counting the dollar bills from his cash drawer with meaty fingers . Gabe was a short , fleshy brother with worried eyes and a low BS quotient . He would n't tolerate a holdup without showing something in his face , even if someone had a gun jammed in his back . I tilted my head to scan the tables to see whose magnetic field was trumping mine . I did n't see Serena at first . Although there were only six customers in the place and she was sitting alone at the corner table , she fooled my eyes and I looked right past her . All I 'd seen was a petite , busty brown-skinned girl with a braided crimson weave and a baggy white track suit , like countless ghetto goddesses I pass every day . If someone had asked me at the time , I would n't have recalled her as all that attractive , much less someone I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that raspy , spiced honey that would be unforgettable even if it was n't one of the best-known voices in the world . " Oh , so you ai n't talkin ' today ? " she said , a smile peeling from her lips . There is n't a man alive who could have blinked an eye , taken a breath , or remembered his middle name for at least two seconds after seeing that smile aimed his way . The girl froze me where I stood , my ass hovering six inches above my chair . Serena Johnston . Damn . The girl was a chameleon . Some women need an hour in front of a makeup mirror to make the kind of transformation Serena could make in a blink , just in the slant of her chin and something riveting in her eyes . All of a sudden , she 'd gone from nobody I needed to know to a creature like the ones described in longing song lyrics by the great , dead soul singers  --  all the woman any man could ever need . Her face filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The world might know her as Afrodite  --  the superstar rapper whose first two movies had both scaled the $100 million peak , making her a straight-up movie star , too  --  but she 'd always be Serena to me . Five years ago , the last time I 'd seen her , films were just a dream she was chasing the way a freezing man might fan a glowing ember . I knew she 'd get it going sooner or later , but nobody could have expected her to rise so fast . I could n't even take it personally that she had n't returned either of my phone messages  --  one to congratulate her on her first blockbuster , the second to give my condolences after the rapper Shareef , a friend of hers , was killed the night of his Staples Center concert soon after the last time I saw her . I knew Serena had known Shareef almost all her life , and he 'd started her career , so that must have torn a hole in her heart . She did n't call back either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niceties . Besides , I figured she was too much like me . The past was the past . And now here she was . Here we were . Stupid me . I thought it was my lucky day . I went to Serena 's table and leaned over to kiss her cheek , soft as satin . I caught a whiff of sandalwood and jasmine , last night 's fragrance . So , the fan rags were right : She wore Christian 's Number One . Girlfriend had come a long way . My clothes and watch were worth four hundred dollars more than my bank balance , and this woman could afford damn near two thousand Gs for a bottle of perfume . It 's a wonder I could even see Serena beyond the massive chasm that separated our prospects . Being that close to magic made me ache . " My father raised me not to speak to ladies unless I was spoken to , " I said . A ray of girlishness transformed her smile , and I felt a tug from somewhere new . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where 's your crew , Big-Time ? No assistant ? No entourage ? " " T , I 'm a big girl . I do n't need no babysitter to eat waffles . If you were anybody else , I 'd give you a peck and say hey , and then I 'd tell you I 'm not in the mood for company , so give me a call sometime . But instead , I 'm hoping you 'll shut up and sit down . Damn , you smell good . But that 's not Opium . " " Not anymore , " I said . I 'd given up all my old fragrances five years ago . All I wore now was Aqua di Gio , leaving the exotic Oriental spices behind . I could n't wear Opium , Gucci Envy , any of them . There 's something about cologne : It can make you a different man . Whenever I went back to my old fragrances , I itched for old habits . Serena rested her chin on both fists , studying me like I mattered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted me to say I was doing fine . Great . Never been better . " Fine , darlin ' . Great . Never better . " " Do n't lie to me , T. For real . " Right then , I wanted to tell her about the past month . I could feel the story clawing from my stomach , trying to break free . A bad taste flooded my mouth , and I took the liberty of sipping from her water glass . Serena had never minded sharing . " Everybody goes through changes now and then . You know how it is . You ? " " Fine . Great . Never better . " Two liars , then . Serena 's eyes did n't look like they belonged to a woman who owned her own powerhouse production company and had more brokers on her speed-dial than a girl from the Baldwin Hills " Jungle " had any right to fantasize about . I might as well have been staring into my own problems . If I could have , I would have yanked Serena away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maui spot , an out-of-the-way beach where the sun-crisped tourists do n't treat locals like their personal valets . Just for a few days . We would n't have to say a word . The otherworldly sunsets would have cleansed us beyond anything language could provide . I 'm not the wishing type , but I wish I could have done that for Serena . " I 've got a steady gig , " I told her . " Deodorant commercials . " " I thought that was you . What else you got going on ? " " One gig pays the rent , for now . My agent is n't worth shit . You ever heard this joke ? An actor comes home and his house has burned to the ground . His wife is bruised up , her dress torn . She sobs , ' Your agent came to the house , he raped me , he killed our children , and he burned up everything we own . ' The actor says : ' My agent came to the house ? What did he say ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got a smile and a laugh . " I feel you . That 's harsh , " she said . " If I can get my agent to call me back two weeks later , hey , it 's all good . I must be sentimental , or maybe I 'm just too lazy to shop around . " That was only half the story . Blaming your agent is a citywide pastime in Hollywood . If I had n't scored the Dry Xtreme gig , Len would have given up on me . Before the commercials , I had n't made him any money in eighteen months . Len could have cut me loose in the nineties , but he never had . We had been together for ten years , longer than his marriage . Len used to think I was going places . On rare occasions , he still believed it . " You 're a lot of things , T , but you ai n't lazy . Or sentimental . " A lilac business card materialized on the table in front of me. casanegra productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see was modeled after the script on the Casablanca movie poster . Classy . I also recognized the name on the card : Devon Biggs . He was from Serena 's old neighborhood , a friend she and Shareef had known since elementary school . Apparently , Biggs was the gatekeeper to her empire . " Call him today . Tell him I told you to call , " Serena said . " Nah , girl . I was just playing . I 'm doing fine . " It did n't feel right . Do n't get me wrong : I gave up the luxury of pride long ago . But both times I 'd met Devon Biggs , back when I was hanging with Serena , he 'd looked at me with a combination of pity and scorn that set my teeth on edge . I 'd chew my leg off before I called that smug SOB . " Do n't hurt my feelings , T. I 've got two or three things popping I could use you for . Speaking parts , too . Good parts , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is the short line  --  and I know you hate lines . Talk to Dev . " A snap of her finger , and she could change my life . Maybe it was a combination of my usual insomnia the night before , an empty stomach , and the pile of unpaid bills stuffed in my kitchen drawer , but I wanted to hug Serena like a sister right then . I do n't know why the hell I did n't . There I go , wishing again . I was down to one of my last cards , since I 'd been leaving them all over town . In my hand was the card I was saving for my chance encounter with Steven Spielberg outside of Mel 's Drive-In or Spago , but instead I gave it to Serena . Nothing special  --  just my name , head shot , cell number , and PO box . tennyson hardwick  --  actor at large . Serena smiled when she saw it . If I 'd had more to spare , I would have given her a dozen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got your own stories , Mighty Afrodite . " I knew Serena would never take the bait , but for some reason I gave it a try . Serena lived far behind her eyes , and always had . Sure enough , she only shrugged as if she had n't heard me . I was hungry as hell by the time the waitress came to ask what I wanted , but I noticed that Serena 's plate was empty and her check was already waiting , so I only ordered coffee . I did n't want Serena to think I expected her to sit while I ate my meal , and I did n't want to be sitting alone at the table when she got up and walked back into her life . I did n't have room for any more empty spaces , not that day . " How 's your dad ? " Serena said once the waitress was gone . I felt my face harden into steel . I was n't going to talk about my father , especially on an empty stomach . " Same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I got steel in return . " Same shit , different decade . " Small talk had never been our forte , I remembered . " Do you know how to use those espresso machines , T ? " " Why ? You got some restaurants you 're hiring for , too ? " Serena gave me the finger . The gesture would have been coarse from anyone else , but I appreciated how slender her finger was , how smooth the skin , how delicate the pearl coloring on her nail ; it seemed more like a bawdy promise . Serena took that same finger and dabbed from a pool of syrup on her plate , then gently kissed the pad clean . " Because , T , I was thinking ... somebody I work with gave me one of those machines  --  a housewarming gift . And it 's been sitting up on my kitchen counter for six months because people I came with ca n't even pronounce ' espresso . ' And if you 're not too in love with that cup of coffee you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup at my place . Like a virgin voyage . " It took my mind a second to register that she had just invited me to her place . I expected her to break out into a laugh , to own up to the joke . She did n't . She was waiting for my answer . As if a sane man could utter any answer except one . Gabe could barely contain his smirk as I held the door open for Serena . She walked out into the midmorning sunshine , brightening the day . " You take care , Ten , " Gabe said with a wink . " It 's not what you think , man . " But at that moment , I was n't sure what it was . And I did n't care . Outside , Serena and I almost ran headfirst into a man who looked like he might have been a linebacker in his younger days ; broad from the neck down . Serena 's not an inch more than five-foot-two , and in his shadow , she looked like an acorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallish eyes were locked on Serena 's face . Whether he meant to or not , he was blocking our path . " Hey , " the man said , dumbstruck except for the single word . " I get that a lot , " Serena said . " It 's not me . We just look alike . " The man raised his pointing finger , his head drooping down so low to the side that it almost rested on his shoulder . " Oh , uh-uh , " he said , not fooled . " Afrodite . Hey , it 's Afrodite ! " He was shouting , raising the alarm like it was his civic duty . Back when I knew Serena , she was still dusting off the asphalt of Crenshaw and Jefferson , taking diction and acting classes in a quest for refinement so Hollywood would see her as more than a famous face with a lucrative demographic . In The Jungle , if someone had stepped up on her like this fool , Afrodite would have cussed him out , then kneed his groin if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . I felt Serena shrink against me as if she thought she could vanish inside the crook of my arm . Yeah , something was wrong . " Hey , playa , give us some room , " I said . The man had a good four inches on me , but no one would have known that by my eyes . " My lady says you made a mistake . " The man was ten years my senior , probably in his midforties , but he was still thick and solid . I 'd much rather negotiate with a two-hundred-thirty-pound man than fight . Would n't anybody ? But I 'd already made up my mind that if he did n't take two steps back to let us by , I was going to break his instep . Something about Serena 's trusting weight against me made me feel like taking chances . A light went out in the man 's eyes . I could see that he was a big man who sometimes forgot his size , and he had n't meant anything by it . He backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , though . You got a twin , baby-girl . " I took Serena 's hand as she led me down Sunset , where her downy white Escalade was parked at a meter . I knew it from the rear plate : casaneg . I felt her tiny fingers tremor against mine . " It 's not like the old days , Serena . You need a minder . " " I got one . He 's off today . " " Then you need two . You ca n't be out alone . " As she zapped off her car alarm and the taillights flashed a greeting , Serena looked up at me with irritation and something else that made my stomach queasy . A shadow cut her face in half , and a single brown-green eye , glimmering in the sun , was searching me in a way she never had . " You looking for that job , too ? " " I 'm not working today . " " Who said you were , Tennyson ? " Hearing her voice wrapped around my Christian name made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet . A wall of heat rose with her as she stepped onto her Escalade 's running board to bring us to eye level . There was only one thing to do : Right there on the street in front of ten other witnesses , I kissed Serena Johnston as though I had the right .
