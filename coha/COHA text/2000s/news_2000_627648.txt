<p> CAN the Grinch steal Christmas ? <p> Is Bruce Willis ' box-office winning streak " Unbreakable ? " <p> Will 102 Dalmatians hit the spot(s) ? <p> The holiday film season contains the answers to these multimillion-dollar questions . <p> With an eye to winning Oscar nominations , the studios release their prestige films late in the year , hoping members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences remember them when they vote on the Academy Awards early next year . Of course , kids will be out of school soon , so family films hit screens , too . <p> Whether your idea of a movie star is Mel Gibson or Geoffrey Rush ; whether your movie glands are tickled by special effects or literary adaptations ; whether your passion is romantic comedy or kiddie fare - you can find something aimed your way between now and New Year 's Day . <p> We have an asterisk by the titles of films that appear to have strong Academy Award nomination prospects . Just remember , it 's all speculation based on good buzz or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those films open here in late December or early January . ( Films must open in Los Angeles before year 's end to qualify for Oscars : other cities , including Houston , usually get them a week or more later . ) <p> As always , dates may change . <p> Friday <p> Bounce : For his own selfish reasons , Buddy ( Ben Affleck ) does a favor that costs a stranger his life in a plane crash . Much later , Buddy tracks down the man 's wife ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) , looking to make amends . But he falls for her and does n't ' fess up . Uh-oh . Don Roos , whose The Opposite of Sex was one of 1998 's best surprises , wrote and directed . Miramax . <p> *Dr . Seuss ' How the Grinch Stole Christmas : Did they really have to tell us in the title that Dr. Seuss wrote the book ? And everyone surely knows that Jim Carrey , wearing more makeup than Tammy Faye Bakker Messner , plays the green Grinch who spoils Whoville 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he usually finds a way to make films interesting . Look for this to score makeup , design and/or special effects Oscar nominations . Universal . <p> Rugrats in Paris : In the sequel to the animated tiny tots hit , Chuckie is looking for a new mom , and he , Tommy , Angelika , Phil , Lil , Baby Dil , Didi and others head to romantic Paris to help Chuckie 's dad find a new wife . Paramount . <p> The 6th Day : In the future , cloning humans is illegal , so when Adam Gibson ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) finds he has been cloned , he 's a tad miffed . He 's even less happy to find assassins plan to kill him to cover up the secret . Der Arnold 's last action comeback , End of Days , failed to make back its costs in the United States but did better overseas . He 's hoping this science-fiction effort captures some of his old Terminator/Total Recall magic at the box office here . Columbia . <p> Nov. 22 <p> 102 Dalmatians : The 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil was a big reason . Cruella , now out of prison , is again up to her old evil ways , trying to turn those ink spots with tails into fur coats . Gerard Depardieu co-stars , since this one 's set in Paris . What is it with kid films and Paris this year ? Disney . <p> Unbreakable : Forget the title ; the studio was thinking " unbeatable " when they re-teamed Bruce Willis , The Sixth Sense writer-director M. Night Shyamalan and a story with supernatural overtones . It seems there are humans on Earth who can not be hurt . Willis ' character is one , and Samuel L. Jackson knows about them . Robin Wright Penn co-stars . The Sixth Sense surprised with six Oscar nominations and huge box office . Can lightning strike twice ? Touchstone . <p> Dec. 8 <p> Dungeons and Dragons : In a land ruled by magic , Jeremy Irons is the evil magician trying to prevent Empress Savina ( Thora Birch ) from establishing equality for all . Based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life : Will the tabloid interest in Meg Ryan 's romance with Gladiator Russell Crowe help this romantic drama to box-office success ? Ryan is a wife who hires negotiator Crowe to get her husband ( David Morse ) back from Latin American rebels . David Caruso co-stars . Taylor Hackford ( The Devil 's Advocate ) directed . Warner Bros . <p> *Vertical Limit : Brother and sister mountain climbers ( Chris O'Donnell and Robin Tunney ) with tragedy in their past are again tested in a terrifying high-altitude rescue . The thriller co-stars Bill Paxton and Scott Glenn and was directed by Martin Campbell ( GoldenEye ) . The studio was so excited about this it previewed scenes weeks ago for the press . It 's intense and not recommended for those with a fear of heights . A special effects Oscar nomination seems likely . Columbia . <p> Dec. 15 <p> Dude , Where 's My Car : Ashton Kutcher of That ' 70s Show stars in a film about guys who can handle pot and parking , but not at the same time . Fox . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation songfest features the voices of David Spade and John Goodman in a comedy about a young emperor turned into a llama , who needs the help of a peasant to reclaim his title . Disney . <p> What Women Want : We bet Mel Gibson just wanted to see that title , followed by his name . Who can argue ? As if Mel needs help , here he 's an executive who gets into women 's minds through an accident that allows him to hear their thoughts . Talk about wish fulfillment . At first he uses it to outsmart his new boss ( Helen Hunt ) , but soon , inside information leads to insight and love . Paramount . <p> Dec. 20 <p> *Thirteen Days : One of the most dangerous periods in modern history took place when President Kennedy challenged the Soviet Union for putting nuclear weapons in Cuba . Kevin Costner stars as a presidential aide who witnesses the political infighting in Washington during the crisis . Costner , who has not had a major hit in years , may view opening weekend as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be a strong candidate for Oscar nominations , but Costner is not currently in favor , and director Roger Donaldson ( Species ) has no previous Oscar track record . New Line . <p> Dec. 22 <p> *Cast Away : What happens when an uptight , clock-watching workaholic ( Tom Hanks ) lands on an isolated island , where he struggles to survive ? Helen Hunt is his girlfriend who assumes he 's dead . This was made before TV 's Survivor , which left the studio wondering if their movie would be helped or hurt by that show 's success . It 's a Hanks movie , directed by Robert Zemeckis ( Back to the Future , Forrest Gump , What Lies Beneath ) , with a script by Texan Bill Broyles ( Apollo 13 ) , so they probably need n't worry . Hanks and Zemeckis together again sounds like sure nomination potential . Fox . <p> The Family Man : It reads like a male version of Sliding Doors . A Wall Street trader wakes up to an alternate reality , in which he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tea Leoni star in the romantic fantasy drama . Universal . <p> Miss Congeniality : See if you buy this one : Sandra Bullock is a tough , no-frills FBI agent who has to go undercover as a beauty pageant contestant , something she finds revolting . Michael Caine is the consultant who has to transform her . Benjamin Bratt is her partner . Are you giggling yet ? Warner Bros . <p> Wes Craven Presents Dracula 2000 : Horror maven Craven produced but did n't direct an update of the vampire tale , with the Count in 21st-century America . Keep your neck covered . Christopher Plummer is Van Helsing , with Gerard Butler as the blood-sucker . Jonny Lee Miller also stars . Dimension . <p> Dec. 25 <p> *All the Pretty Horses : The first book of novelist Cormac McCarthy 's " modern " Western series comes to the screen with Matt Damon and Henry Thomas as young Texans in 1949 who ride into Mexico and get into plenty of trouble , some involving Penelope Cruz . It is the kind of dark , novel-based film that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miramax . <p> *Finding Forrester : A famous but reclusive writer ( Sean Connery ) of the J.D. Salinger mold forms an unlikely bond with a talented New York youth ( Rob Brown ) , who must choose between a life in basketball or literature . It is directed by Gus Van Sant , who teamed a street-smart kid with a wise older guide in Good Will Hunting . Connery sounds perfectly cast as a testy but charismatic member of the literati . Connery is popular , there 's good buzz for his performance , and Van Sant was a 1997 Oscar nominee . Columbia . <p> Early January <p> Anti-Trust : Take the title seriously in a thriller about a computer software writer ( Ryan Phillippe ) who gets to work for his idol ( Tim Robbins ) but uncovers dark secrets in the master 's company . MGM . <p> *O Brother , Where Art Thou ? : The latest offbeat comedy-adventure from the Coen brothers , Ethan and Joel , finds George Clooney and John Turturro escaping from a Mississippi chain gang , trying to find a treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely a matter of taste , but since Fargo , even Oscar pays attention to them . Touchstone/Universal . <p> The Pledge : Jack Nicholson stars in the story of an about to retire detective pledged to find the killer of a child . Nicholson pal Sean Penn directed the film , which co-stars his wife , Robin Wright Penn . The three formerly teamed up for The Crossing Guard . With a great cast ( including Vanessa Redgrave , Helen Mirren , Aaron Eckhart and Sam Shepard ) and a story based on a novel by a noted Swiss writer , Friedrich Durrenmatt , this would be considered Oscar bait . But the studio says it will not open in L.A. until after New Year 's Day . If so , it will not qualify . Warner Bros . <p> Save the Last Dance : Like Saturday Night Fever , this is a musical drama . Julia Stiles is a small-town white teen who goes to a Chicago high school and falls for a black youth ( Sean Patrick Thomas ) who shares her interest in dancing .

Paramount . <p> *Traffic : From director Steven Soderbergh comes a thriller with interrelated stories about the drug trade , adapted from a United Kingdom miniseries . Catherine Zeta-Jones is a wife who takes over her husband 's drug business , and Michael Douglas ( now Zeta-Jones ' real-life hubby ) is the new U.S. drug czar . Soderbergh is a great director ( though his only Oscar nomination was for sex , lies and videotape ) , and the studio is high on this movie 's Oscar chances . However , Soderbergh is likely to be nominated this year for Erin Brockovich , which might hurt his chance with Traffic . Dennis Quaid and Don Cheadle co-star .
