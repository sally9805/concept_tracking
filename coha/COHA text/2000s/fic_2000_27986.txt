It 's all true . When the squad car rolled up behind me and the loudspeaker blared , " Hold it , right there ! " I was , in fact , trying to break into George Dishey 's house . But I had an excuse . Really . It 's true that I had chosen to attack a window at the back of the house so I would not be seen , but think about it : If I 'd thought I was doing something wrong , I would have at least waited until dark . I was n't standing there in those shrubberies , hurrying the job , jamming that knife blade into that window sash that recklessly because I was afraid anyone would think I was breaking in , which I of course was ; no , I was hiding in the backyard because I was afraid the neighbors would see me and make unpleasant presumptions about my social life . It was that kind of neighborhood . George had taken pains to let me know that . " They re good Mormons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice as if they could hear him , even with the doors and windows locked , in the so-called privacy of his own living room . " You know how it is , " he had continued , with a dramatic sigh . " Here I am , the eligible bachelor , making a decent living . Those good Mormon mommas watch me like a hawk . " He 'd lifted an index finger to one eye , demonstrating the look with all the dramatic flair for brush , cussed under my breath that it still did n't look quite right , walked up to the front door , and then stopped . What if the neighbors saw me leaving ? What , in fact , would they think ? Was this town still so conservative that having a woman in his house without benefit of wedlock might compromisehis career ? And worse , might I draw an unwelcome opinion-fest from some self-righteous church lady ? In the end , I had waited until I saw the neighbors file out to their minivans in their Sunday finest , gave them ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their prayer books or something , and all but dashed out to my car , slamming the front door behind me . That was silly , I know , but there you have it . I was sprinting down the sidewalk , thinking nothing more clever than , Will some tardy church lady see my slacks and know I 'm not heading to church ? when I realized I had left the keys to my rental car in the house . As I skidded to a halt , that realization collided with the next , which was that I had no key to George Dishey 's house , either . He had not offered me one . Good old George had managed to exert some control over my comings and goings after all . So you see , it was all very innocent , and , in fact , it was with the best intentions that I was breaking into George Dishey 's house . And if I was acting a mite covert , it was because I was worried about his honor , not my albeit felonious-looking activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I about jumped out of my skin . The pocketknife I was using to jimmy the lock on the bedroom window jerked free of my grip and gouged deeply into my left thumb . That left me stunned for a moment , and of course an instant later my thumb began to hurt like fury , but at least that gave me something to squeal about while I tried to organize my thoughts . Imagine the scene . Baritone voice through loudspeaker : " You there ! Drop your weapon ! " I : " Hey , no problem ! " I tossed the knife onto the lawn and clutched the wound shut with my right hand . It was starting to bleed , fast . Voice : " Now back away from the building , slow and easy . " I : " Okay , I'mthis hurts ! " I stumbled out of the bushes and turned gingerly to see what was behind me . The lights on the top of the car were wheeling about . My heart began to race , and sounds seemed to recede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then out of his car and halfway up the lawn , moving toward me with one hand hovering over his now-unlatched holster , eased in toward the window and with one foot kicked my old beat-up two-blade Buck knife farther away from me . " Kneel down and put your hands apart on the ground ! " he ordered . I knelt . " Hands on the ground ! " Blood began to drip from between my fingers . " I ... I ca n't . I 'm , ah , bleeding . " The blood was escaping my grip now , plop , plop , plop . I did n't want to get it on my slacks . They were the only really good pair I owned , and they fit well , and when you do n't really have a waist and you 're a bit thick through the thighs like I am , a fit like that is hard to find . The cop noted the blood as he quickly surveyed the scene . " What are you doing here ? " he asked brusquely . I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good answer . " What are you doing here ? " he repeated . His hand still hovered above his holster . I wondered thickly what all the excitement was . Sure , he had caught me outside a man 's house on a Sunday morning with no church to go to , but was that a capital offense ? What if this were my house ? Was this how Salt Lake City 's finest approached well-dressed home owners who chose to fiddle with their window locks on Sunday mornings ? Or was there an all-points bulletin out for a female cat burglar of medium height , brown hair , sort of forgettable-looking , who liked the challenge of broad-daylight theft ? " I 'm ... um ... " The moment was so unreal that I found myself watching him as if he were a movie . That impression was amplified by the fact that he was movie-star good-looking and very fit . Sharp blue eyes with heavy black lashes . Black hair . A ruddy , healthy pallor , roses and cream , like the best of the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like something in a clothing ad . In an effort to make sense of what was happening , my mind decided that if I were watching a movie , I must be on a date . Yes , that fit , because I was , after all , wearing some of my best clothing , and I 'd just showered and done what I could for my face . I felt embarrassed that my date had caught me kneeling on the lawn , and I hoped he would n't think I was some kind of slob . Here he 'd been so kind to invite me to his movie , and I 'd gone and knelt in the dirt . I did n't want to disappoint him . He seemed so ... authoritative . I shook my head , trying to clear it . My mind was going . For a moment , I wondered if it were loss of blood , but I had n't lost that much , not yet . Then I remembered that with any injury , no matter how slight , there is some measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . Try it sometime , when you 're on your knees in front of a policeman while bleeding from a fresh knife wound . The old pipe can grow tight . Finally , I managed to say , " I 'm a guest of Dr. Dishey 's , " and tipped my head toward the house . " I have to get to this conference I 'm attending , and I got out here to my car and realized that I 'd forgotten my keys . They 're right in there , on the um " I peered up toward the window . My stomach was beginning to flutter . I 'm usually tougher at the sight of blood , having done my share of ranch chores in my day , but I began to feel the need to put my head between my knees . " Can this wait ? " I mumbled . The cop unclipped his microphone and called his station . " Central , this is Raymond . Got a female Caucasian here , medium height , brown hair , gray eyes , early thirties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the hospital . " He needed a backup to take me to the hospital ? What ? " Listen , " I said , " if there 's any problem , you can talk to Dr. Dishey about it . I do n't know where he went , but I 'm sure he 'll be back any time now . We 're supposed to be at the conference by noon , so I mean ... " A wave of nausea swept over me . " Please ? " Another police car pulled up at the curb , siren bawling to a stop . My head was beginning to ping . I looked up into the firm , handsome face of my non-guardian angel , or at least this angel who appeared to be guarding the world from me , and found him studying me with a mixture of detachment and concern . He neither looked away nor met my eyes , but gazed at me steadily , as if watching for signs that would alert him if I was about to attempt flight . I felt a growing need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I stared up into his eyes . They were like a mountain lake at dusk , almost indigo , very deep . " My car keys are inside , " I said softly . " My luggage is inside . George will be back , I swear it . He can explain everything . " Still he did not make eye contact . I looked awayat the ground , at the grass stains on my knees , at the sticky blood that was accumulating between them . Then , as the legs and feet of two more policemen hove into my darkening view , he said , " That 's not hardly likely , is it , ma'am ? Because we found George Dishey an hour ago , and he 's dead . But you already know that , do n't you ? " Chapter Two I had never been handcuffed before , let alone to a hospital gurney . I lay staring at the texture of the ceiling tiles , feeling the constriction of that cold steel bracelet , wondering what could possibly have happened to George Dishey that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask . Murder is an ugly thing however it is done , and all the fight was gone out of me for the time being . I waited only for the anesthetic the intern had injected into my thumb to take effect so that the pain would stop . After that , I did n't care what happened . They could stitch my thumb to the floor as long as they kept it numbed . I shook my head , trying again to clear it . Being welded to a flooror to a murder investigationwould not do at all . I had a job to return to in Denver , where I was working as a petroleum geologist for a boss who had not been amused at the thought of releasing me for three days for an activity that would not directly add to the stuffing in his wallet . " A conference on forensic geology ? " he had snorted , showing me yellowed teeth around the remnants of his spent cigar . His shrewd eyes had danced thoughtfully as he chewed ruminantly on the tattered roll of tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Um , it 's a sideline of mine . You see , I use what I know about geology and geological industries to help solve crimes . I 've acted as a consultant to the police a few times , " I 'd said , as the palms of my hands grew moist . I had waited until the last minute to ask for leave , even though I 'd known about the conference for months . " Crap , " he 'd replied . " You find me some oil . You got ta scratch this itch , fine ; take your vacation time . But I wan na see you back here by Thursday with nuttin on your mind but Drill here . ' " Before I could get another word in edgewise , he 'd plugged a fresh cigar into his mouth and flicked his fingers at me , his way of announcing to his underlings that their audience with the king was over . My heart had fallen . In the tradition of many oil-patch entrepreneurs , my cigar-chewing employer granted two weeks ' leave each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the second week . I had shuffled down to the personnel office to sign away three-fifths of my annual vacation , thoughts of rebellion thoroughly buried under the weight of reality . Petroleum jobs were rare as hen 's teeth . My previous boss , J. C. Menken , had called in a lot of favors to get me this one after his company folded . With recent mergers of the giant companies , Mr. Cigar could have his pick of lackeys like me , and I suspected that he had at length only approved my leave on the basis that he could brag to his buddies in the steam room that one of his slaves had been invited somewhere by the famous George Disheyyou know , da dinosaur guy you see on da TV programs . So as I lay on that gurney , I was less worried about my thumb than the fact that I had to be at my desk by Thursday morning at 8:00 . With George dead , the fizz had all gone out of this whole junket , and it would have suited me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight home and be at work on Monday . Unfortunately , I already had too good an idea what involvement in a murder investigation could do to my chances of getting home on time . Time . The second hand on a large , impersonal clock swept slowly around its smooth white face . I stared at it , trying not to look into the eyes of Officer Raymond . That , I did not want to do . Looking at Officer Raymond made me want to cry , and as long as I did n't understand why I felt that way , I was n't going to let it happen . Presently , the intern slipped back in through the door from some other job she was doing and probed at the fleshy part of my thumb . " Do you feel that ? " she inquired . " No . " " Good . Now just hold still , and I 'll have you sewn up in a jiffy . " " Fine . " Stoic was a role I knew how to play . Clink , clack went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh . She opened a suturing packet and laid out the prethreaded needles on a sterile cloth . She selected a weapon . I turned my head to look away , but there stood Officer Raymond . I looked back . She irrigated the wound , probed for foreign objects , irrigated again . Lifted a needle . At the precise moment she lowered it to my thumb , a new man walked into the emergency room . The intern paused , looking up at him . He smiled at her , at me , at the sceneflashed a big juicy grin that only amplified the unnervingly bright light in his eyesand flipped open a wallet to show me his badge . " Go right on with your work , Grace , " he said to the intern . " I 'm just going to ask your patient a few questions . " Sadist , I thought . " Fine , Bert , " said the intern . " Just keep out of my light . " " Your name is Emily B for Bradstreet Hansen , " the man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guest of the deceased . " " Yes . " I concentrated on his face , which was only a little less daunting than the sight of the intern preparing to suture my thumb . A pressure hit my left thumb . That was all , just pressure , but I knew what it was . I closed my eyes and breathed deeply , remembering the half-dozen other times I 'd had stitches in my life , remembered the horses I 'd fallen off on the way to getting hurt badly enough to need them . Remembered Tug . She fiddled , tying the first knot . " So that 's your story . Okay , " Bert said lightly , as if that was all just fine and settled now . " So we have a homicide on our hands , and maybe you can help us with it , then . " My arm rocked slightly with the intern 's ministrations . " Fine , " I said . " Just ask your questions . I 'm not going anywhere . " Nice , Em . Make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the top ? " Tug . " Certainly . I am a geologist . I am in town for a conference on vertebrate paleontology . Dr. Dishey invited me . I 'm supposed to deliver a short speech this afternoon at one of the symposia , " I said , being somewhat snotty about my Latin plurals for the occasion . " I had never met him before last night , when I drove in from the airport . I had only spoken with him on the phone . My plane was late , delayed by weather coming out of Denver . I 'd give you the flight number , but it 's with my luggage in Dr. Dishey 's house . " Tug . " When I got in , Dr. Dishey offered me a drink , but I said I was tired and just wanted to go to bed . I did just that . Alone . In a separate room from Dr. Dishey . That was at about nine . This morning early , I heard the phone ring . I heard Dr. Dishey answer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , and half a minute later , I heard him go out . He slammed the door . I heard his vehicle start . Big engine . Sounded like a truck . I heard it leave . I went back to sleep . I stayed asleep until about seven . " Pressure . Tug . My stomach was starting to swim again . I swallowed hard and told myself it was the anesthetic . Tried not to think about the fact that I was lying on my back , and that this man was leaning over me . " I got up , showered , ate breakfast , waited around for a while , and then headed for my rental car . Halfway there , I realized I did n't have my keys . I thought about waiting awhile longer for Dr. Dishey to show up , but I did n't like sitting around on his front porch waiting , so I looked at the window , realized what an old-fashioned latch it had , and thought I 'd give it a go . That was when Officer , ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth and last stitch , finishing her embroidery , and began dressing the wound . I dared open my eyes . The man Bert , obviously a police detectivehe was in civvies , after all , and had that kind of cozy " tell me everything " attitude some of them affectsmiled at me , a kind of ghoulish attagirl . I blinked , hoping he was some narcotic-induced dream bubble that would pop and disappear , but he only swayed slightly , further unseating my stomach . He was somewhere in his forties , with thinning hair combed back in strings , and possessed of rather opaque pale greenish eyes , like two cabuchons of Persian turquoise . Abstract thoughts like that occur to geologistscomparisons between animate and inanimate objectsand they throw us off sometimes . With the stress of being questioned and the local anesthetic confusing the million nerve endings in my beleaguered thumb , the thought upset my mental filing system , putting Detective Bert geographically under P for Persia , rather than under U for Utah . " You could not see this telephone . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . It was in another room . I did not see the telephone , Dr. Dishey , or anything else . " " Why ? " " Because it was not yet light out . There were streetlights , but my bedroom was in the back of the house . The blinds are heavy . There was no clock . I did not look at my watch . " " So you do not , in fact , know what time this telephone rang . " His tone was still light , but I could feel the pressure of his choice of words , the subtle assertions that said , You do n't know what you 're talking about , or , You 're lying . Straining to keep my voice level , I said , " No . If I had to guess , I 'd say about five . " " What exactly did Dr. Dishey shout into this telephone you did not see ? " I took a long , deep breath , mentally counted to ten , and reminded myself that I had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer present . Tried to remember if he or Officer Raymond had read me my rights . Wished the anesthesia had been general . " I could n't hear much . He just sounded angry . " " Nothing at all ? " " Well ... okay , I remember a few choice epithets , the kind of thing you 'd know anywhere , just by the rhythm of the words . " I paused , squeezed my eyes shut again . Would Officer Raymond be shocked that I knew the rhythms of four-letter words ? And what in hell did I care for ? " There was something that sounded like You ca n't ! ' and , You 'll bust the thing to pieces , ' but I could be wrong . I was more asleep than awake . " " Ah . So then you went back to sleep . " " Yes . " " And you awoke about seven . " " Yes . " " Do you always sleep ten hours at night , Em ? " He sounded incredulous , like I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the little girly that the Man knew better . The sting of his insinuation landed right on top of the realization that he had guessed my nickname correctly . Em is what my friends call me , and much as I hate being called Emily , it rankled me that he should presume to be so familiar . Had he made a lucky guess , or had I told him ? No , I was certain I had not . I had , in fact , only offered my driver 's license as explanation of who I was , had given it to Officer Raymond before he loaded me up and brought me to the hospital . Which meant he still had it now . Which meant I could n't drive , even if I could retrieve my keys . Rather than feel fear , I chose anger , and it swept through me like fire . I opened my eyes and fixed a glare on the detective . " Listen , Bert . I know you have a job to do here , and I know it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little hard to believe , too , but I have some experience with police investigations . I am a geologist , but I have been involved with four separate homicide investigations as a special witness . I can present my bona fides . Call the Denver PD and ask for Carlos Ortega in Homicide . In fact , I have worked so closely with him that I can give you his direct number . Would you do that for me ? Hmm ? Would you call him ? " The intern , having finished her chore and cleaned up her utensils , hopped up off her stool and left the room . The detective spread his lips and cheeks into a wide smile that left his pale eyes looking like they 'd been painted on as an afterthought . " Sure , " he said . " All in due time . Tell me about this conference you say you are attending . " I tried to shift my mental gears into neutral . Tried to be Em Hansen the professional , the person who had her game face together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology . Up in Snowbird . " " You 're a paleontologist ? " " I am a geologist , like I said . My specialty is in oil and gas . " " But you 're going to a paleontology conference . " " Yes . Dr. Dishey is a vertebrate paleontologist . A dinosaur specialist . " " Dinosaurs , " he echoed . " Carnivorous dinosaurs , in fact , " I said nastily . " He invited me to the conference to speak on my other , ah , specialty . " " Which is ? " " Forensic geology . That 's why I 've been involved with murder investigations , " I asserted levelly . " It is sometimes necessary to understand geology in order to solve a crime . And I 'm supposed to speak there this afternoon , " I added , looking pointedly at the clock . The detective smiled obnoxiously , raising his eyebrows in a mockery of looking impressed . " Ah , a latter-day Sherlock Holmes . You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was down by the quarry . " At first , I did not favor his jest with a reply . Then I said , " That 's just part of it . More often , it 's a matter of having inside knowledge of the profession . Goes to motivation , " I said importantly . With elaborate condescension , the detective said , " And Dr. Dishey thought you should tell his friends all about it . " " I suppose he thought it would add a little spice , " I hissed . Angry as I was , I had hoped I 'd badgered him into offering a heated rejoinder , but instead , the detective said coolly , " You could go on one of those TV shows . Dead Bodies and the Women Who Love Them . ' Now , about that nice long sleep you had . " " That what ? " " You were in the nice carnivorous dinosaur man 's house , and " " Fine . I slept only seven hours . I do n't sleep well in strange places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyebrows in happy interest . " Wonderful . What ya reading ? " " The Refiner 's Fire . " " What ? " I heard Officer Raymond shift suddenly . I rolled my head toward him and looked at him . His lips had parted . He was surprised , and looked into my eyes for the first time , looked deep inside , as if he expected to find someone he knew in there , someone who 'd been missing for years . Recovering himself , he looked away and spoke to the detective . " Refiner 's Fire . By John L. Brooke . " Now it was my turn to gape . The Refiner 's Fire was a thick scholarly tome on the roots of Mormon cosmology . I had found it on the bookshelf in my room . I had selected it expressly because it had looked dry and brainy enough to put me to sleep . What was a rank-and-file cop doing reading it ? Now the detective smiled his geek smile at Officer Raymond . " One of your church books . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read until midnight , woke up when the phone rang at you think five , went back to sleep until seven . Then you took a shower and ate . What did you eat , Em ? " I took another deep breath , closed my eyes . " Burritos . From the freezer . I do n't recommend them ; in fact , I 'd love it if someone could rustle up a decent doughnut for me . But I ate them , and there you have it . I waited for Dr. Dishey to return . He did not . I got restless . I decided to do some sight-seeing . " " And yet you waited until ten-thirty ? " Now I colored , a nice red blush from collarbone to scalp . If Officer Raymond knew about books on Mormon cosmology , he was sure as hell going to have an opinion about my reasons for tarrying another hour before setting out to my car . " I just waited , " I said firmly . " You waited , " the detective said , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's enough ! " I said . " Are you charging me with a crime , or am I free to go ? " I jerked my right hand into a fist , clanging the bracelet of the handcuff as it tightened against the frame of the gurney . " You call Carlos Ortega ! You do it now ! " Interestingly , it was Officer Raymond who moved to bring things to a conclusion . He stepped halfway out into the hall and signaled to a nurse . " We done here ? " he called . The detective looked at him with an expression bordering on disgust . Then he looked back at me and grinned almost maniacally . " Do n't leave town , " he said , like he thought the line funny .
