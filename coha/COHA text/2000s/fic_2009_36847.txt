Northumberland <br> February 1809 <p> Cade Byron tossed back the whiskey in his glass , then reached for the bottle on the side table next to his armchair . Pouring another hefty dram , he downed the second libation as quickly as the first , the alcohol spreading in a burst of fire over his tongue and throat . Leaning back his head , he closed his eyes and waited for the liquor to do its work . With any luck it would ease the ache in his leg . <p> Confounded thing , he cursed silently , trying not to think too much about the badly healed wound in his right thigh . Always acts up when the weather turns wet  --  or in today 's case , icy , since it 's snowing outside . <p> He supposed he could always take a draught of the laudanum the damn quack had left for him , but he hated the stuff and took care to avoid it . He never felt himself when he used laudanum . The opiate clouded his senses to the point where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastical , disjointed dream , leaving him listless , stultified , and confused . Hard liquor might be just as destructive in the long run , he realized , but at least it dulled his pain without erasing who he was ; and even more important , without robbing him of his sense of control . <p> He knew all about how it felt to lose control . To be denied free will while one trembled on the brink , a second shy of breaking , of begging , of agreeing to violate one 's most sacred oaths in order to make the agony stop . <p> His stomach tightened , a faint wave of nausea rising with the memories . Shoving them aside , he reached again for the glass and bottle , hand shaking as he poured a double measure of whiskey and drank it down . Warmth and calm stole through him . The sensations were artificial , no doubt , but right now he would take what he was given . If only he could add peace to the equation . <p> That 's all I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be left the hell alone . <p> Which is exactly what he 'd told Edward last week when his older brother came for a visit , determined to dislodge him from his exile and return him to the bosom of the family  --  and in the case of the Byrons , that was a very big bosom indeed . <p> " You 've buried yourself up here like a bear in hibernation , " Edward had told him as he paced the study with a long-legged stride . " It 's been six months now . Do n't you think it 's time you rejoined the world ? " <p> " From what I can see , the world appears to be spinning along just fine without me , " he replied . <p> Edward frowned , his black brows granting him a fearsome look . " Well , Mama is not fine . She 's worried , especially since you refuse to answer her letters . " <p> Cade raked his fingers through his hair . " I read them . Tell her I 've read them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . More than that , I ca n't offer right now . " <p> " Look , I know what you went through in Portugal  --  " <p> " Do you ? " Cade asked in an almost expressionless voice . <p> Edward had the grace to lower his gaze . " I know enough . And because of it , I 've given you room . Let you have time to yourself to grieve and heal . But all you seem to be doing is grieving with none of the healing . You look like bloody hell , Cade . Come to Braebourne with me . Be with people again , with family . Come home . " <p> For the tiniest moment , Cade had considered the plea , but just as quickly discarded it . " I am home . This estate is mine , or so I was informed in the reading of Uncle George 's will . Now , if that 's all , Your Grace , I suggest we go have our dinner before it grows cold . " <p> Cade had known Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But after three futile days that did nothing to change Cade 's mind , Edward finally conceded defeat , climbed into his coach and drove away . <p> Or been driven away , Cade mused , knowing he 'd forced his brother out  --  out of his house , out of his life . Just as he wanted . <p> And I do , he assured himself . I want solitude . Solitude and peace . <p> Taking up the bottle again , he refilled his glass , the last drops of whiskey draining out in a slow drip-drip-drip . Setting the bottle aside , he lifted the glass to his lips . <p> Just then , the study door opened on a set of well-oiled hinges , a tiny old man with a downy nimbus of white hair slipping into the room . Cade gave him no more than a cursory glance before leaning his head against the high seat back once again and closing his eyes . <p> " Have Harvey carry in some more wood for the fire , would you , Beaks ? " Cade commanded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scotch . This one 's ready for the rubbish bin . " <p> " Aye , my lord . Oh , and ye 've a visitor here to see ye . " With that , the old man shuffled from the room , as silently as if he had never been there at all . <p> Cade scowled . What had Beaks said ? Something about a visitor ? Well , if there is someone fool enough to call on me , they can just take themselves off again . He reached for the whiskey bottle , cursing under his breath when he remembered it was empty . <p> A faint rustling came from the direction of the door . Turning his head toward the sound , he caught a shimmer of gray as a woman came into view . She hovered , her fine-boned face and slender form revealed in the low light of the fire . Her hair was the pale blond hue of moon glow , her eyes the soft , silvery blue of a mist-shrouded lake . Dusted pink as new blush roses , the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her skin . <p> <br> Continues ...
