The Search Begins Ryan heard movement in the hospital hallway and scrunched behind Bruce 's bed . " I got ta go now , " Ryan whispered . Bruce was n't moving anymore . " You get some rest . I 'll tell everybody you said hi . " Ryan squeezed Bruce 's hand . Bruce did n't respond . Ryan tiptoed to the stairwell door without being noticed . He closed it gently and bolted down the stairs . When he came out on the first floor , he ducked into the gift shop and bought licorice and a candy bar . He slipped past the older woman at the desk and calmly walked out the emergency-room doors . Outside , three women were smoking . For a moment , Ryan could n't get his bearings . Had he come from the fight or left ? " Which way to Kirchoff Road ? " Ryan said . A frail woman tried to speak but coughed violently . She pointed to the right . " Thanks , " Ryan said , and he was off . It felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ryan wanted to tell Judd about his visit with Bruce . He knew Judd would be ticked , but he did n't care . Ryan would just laugh and take Phoenix for a run in the park . As he rode toward a hill , he heard a plane overhead . It was flying low . Too low . Ryan looked up in time to see the underside of the fighter jet . The roar was deafening . Ryan was sure it was going to crash . He glanced down just as his front tire hit the curb . Ryan struggled to stay up and swerved into the street . Just as he gained control , an **25;225;TOOLONG behind him threw him to the pavement . His bike skittered ahead . He saw blood on his elbow and a huge hole in his jeans . Tires screeched . A van was sliding toward him ! He stared , frozen , as it demolished his bike and stopped within inches of his face He smelled gasoline . Fire crackled behind him . Screams filled the air . More planes flew overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and tried to get around him , but his bike was caught underneath , Ryan grabbed the front bumper and pulled himself up . The driver was looking back . The man on the passenger side was short with a round face and looked like he needed a shave . Ryan saw something move in the back of the van . The driver mined and yelled . The other man banged on the window and screamed , " Get outta the way , kid ! " Ryan ran to check his bike . The crumpled handlebars were caught between the back wheel and the bumper . With the explosions and noise around him , his first thought was to run . Find shelter . Get to safety . But something drew him to the van . He peered through the tinted window . Nothing . He cupped his hand to block the light and was barely able to make out a kid with heavy gray tape over his mouth . Ryan tapped on the window , and the kid turned . Blindfolded ! " Get away from there ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pry the bike loose . " Stupid kid . " Ryan studied the rear license plate , but the short man yelled , " Help me with this ! " Ryan felt the heat from the explosions , and the smoke made it hard to breathe . He yanked the bike loose and watched the short man throw it aside . " What 's wrong with that kid ? " Ryan said . " What kid ? " " The one with the duct tape . " The man looked at him menacingly . " You did n't see nobody , understand ? " The man jumped into the van , and it sped off . Suddenly it stopped and screeched back right at him . He ran to the hill . The van was right behind him as he neared the top . Flames and smoke rose into the air . Before Ryan could see what was on the other side , the van slid to a stop in the grass , and both men jumped out . " Get him ! " the driver yelled . Before Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They threw him into the back of the van . Ryan banged his head on an armrest and lay on the floor . From there he could see only the kid 's hands . Riding boots . Long fingernails . Weird , Ryan thought . The men held Ryan down and taped his hands and feet . He kicked and screamed with all his might , but they were too strong . They laid him sideways beneath the seat . " Sorry , kid , " the short man said as the van sped away . " Ca n't take no chances . " " You 're king of the double negative , " Ryan said , " you know that ? " The man ignored him and wrapped tape around the back of Ryan 's head and over his mouth . Getting this off is really gon na hurt , Ryan thought . Before the man tied the blindfold , Ryan could see only black smoke out the window . He wondered if he would ever see Bruce or his friends again . * * * The police , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on and said , " Your friend will show up , okay ? " " You do n't understand , " Lionel said . " No , you do n't understand , " the officer interrupted . " World War III just broke out , in case you did n't notice . We got fires , we got people trapped in rabble , looters , more bombs . Now stop buggin ' us . Find him yourself . " Lionel wanted to scream . " Do n't call the police again , " Judd said . " All we need is them snooping around here . " " We should at least try to find Ryan , " Lionel said . " He 'd do that for you . " " I would n't want him to , " Judd said . " That puts everybody in danger . " " Then why 'd you go out this morning ? " Lionel said . " That put us in danger . " " That was before the bombs started , " Judd said . Vicki and Chaya pleaded with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Vicki said . " I do n't even want to survive , " Chaya said . " Going to heaven has to be better than living without my mother or Bruce or Ryan . " Lionel crossed his arms and shook his head . Vicki put a hand on Lionel 's shoulder . " We all want to find him , " she said . " It 's just hard to even think straight . " " He probably went to his stash of Bibles , " Lionel said . " He could be there hidingor the place could have been bombed and he 's trapped . " " Does anybody know where he hides them ? " Judd said . " I was with him when he started picking them up , " Vicki said , " but he never showed me where he put them . " Judd sat on Lionel 's bed and rubbed his face with both hands . " Let 's go through this one more time , " Judd said . " You 're sure Ryan was n't at the hospital ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And they do n't allow kids in intensive care . " " That 's what I told him , " Judd said . " He thought I was trying to shut him out . " " You were ! " Lionel said . " I was trying to take care of him , " Judd said . " Let 's back up . Ryan was mad because we did n't let him in on the meeting about Mark . " " So was I , " Lionel said . " He wanted to go see Bruce , and I told him to forget it . " " Yeah , that 's when he took off , " Lionel said . " When he came back he brought me a card and asked me to give it to Bruce when I saw him . " " And you said you would , if you had the chance , " Lionel said . " If you had n't been so " " This is not helping , " Judd interrupted . " What kind of card ? " Vicki said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a card did Ryan get for Bruce ? " " Why does that matter ? " Judd said . " It was something about heaven , " Lionel interrupted , trying to remember . " That 's it . He found a card that looked like heaven , and he wanted Bruce to see it . " " What did you do with the card ? " Vicki said . " I left it over there . Hey , it 's gone ! " " He was there ! " Vicki shouted . " What are you talking about ? " Judd said . " On the nightstand by Bruce 's bed there was this card , blue sky with cloudslike heaven . That has to be Ryan 's card . He could have gotten someone else to deliver it , but the nurses and the orderly had n't seen him , so it only makes sense that he gave it to Bruce himself . " " But how ? " Judd said . " You sell him short , " Lionel said . " He 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He may have been inside when the bomb hit . " " You guys do n't know him like I do , " Lionel said . " If he saw Bruce , he would have come back here fast . He 'd have wanted to tell you , Judd . He 'd have been juiced about it . " " Then where is he ? " " I do n't know , " Lionel said . " That 's why we have to go back to the hospital . " More explosions rocked the van when they drove away , but then the bombing stopped . The traffic must have been bad . Ryan felt lots of stops and starts . The men did n't say much , and with the tape over his mouth , Ryan could n't talk to the other kid . Every time the van stopped , Ryan slid forward and hit his head on the metal posts under the captain 's chair . The short man laughed at him . Ryan finally managed to roll onto his side and position himself so he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the van felt filthy . Ryan tried to pick up sounds , but mostly he heard the hum of traffic . Someone kept punching buttons on the radio . Finally a news station interviewed an eyewitness to the bombings . A flurry of reports about the damage followed . There were chaos and terror throughout the world . New York City had been hit . " Ah , Who cares about New York ? " the driver said . " Maybe it 'll clear up some traffic . " The short man laughed , and someone turned up the radio . " ... devastating carnage everywhere in the heart of Manhattan , " the reporter said . " Bombed-out buildings , emergency vehicles picking their way through debris , Civil Defense workers pleading with people to stay underground . " Ryan thought of Chloe and Buck . Their apartment was in New York . They had been in Chicago the week before , but could they have gone back before the bombing ? Ryan heard the panic in the reporter 's voice . " I 'm seeking shelter myself now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one knows for certain if the warheads were nuclear , but everyone is being urged to take no risks . Damage estimates will be in the billions of dollars . Loss of life is impossible to determine .... " " You think those bombs we came through were nuc-u-lar ? " the short man said . " Shh , I 'm trying to hear this , " the other man said . " All major transportation centers have been closed or destroyed , " the reporter continued . " Huge traffic jams have snarled the Lincoln Tunnel , the Triborough Bridge , and every major artery out of New York City . What has been known as the capital of the world looks like the set of a disaster movie . " The other kid sniffled throughout the ride . They were speeding when a huge blast shook the earth . The short man cursed . " Look at that mushroom cloud ! " he shouted . A few minutes later the Cable News Network/Global Community Network coverage explained the blast . " Our news base in Chicago has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened O'Hare International Airport . No word yet on whether this was an attack by militia forces or a Global Community retaliatory strike . We have so many reports of warfare , bloodshed , and death in so many major dries around the globe that it will be impossible for us to keep up with all of it . " " What luck , " the driver said . " Can you believe this timing ? Even if the kid 's dad goes to the cops , they 'll be so busy , they wo n't have time to worry about us . " The traffic slowed ; then the van took sharp turns . Finally they stopped . Ryan heard a garage door open , then they drove inside . It sounded as if the two men carried the other kid away . Then they came back for Ryan . They cut the tape over his ankles , and he climbed , still blindfolded , three flights of stairs . The place smelled of wood , and boards creaked under his feet . Ryan heard horns , sirens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew from going to Cubs games with his dad that the elevated train snaked through Chicago , and he guessed it was somewhere along the miles of that track that he 'd been taken . But he could n't be sure . He had been in the van an hour and could even be in Wisconsin or Indiana . Someone pushed him from behind and steered him to a door . He heard a key in a lock and the driver arguing with the other man . The short man said , " You should have just kept going and left him there . " " Too late now , " the other man said . " I could take him to the river or , well , there 's a hundred ways to take care of him . " " Let 's keep ' em both for now , " the driver said . " Stick him in the utility room . " Someone cut the tape from Ryan 's arms and pushed a greasy cheeseburger and some fries into his hands . When the man tipped the tape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his neck , and Ryan yelped . " There 's no easy way to do that , " the man said . " Sorry . " He led Ryan into another room and took off his blindfold . The room was dark . " Keep walking , " the man said . " Mattress is on the floor . And you two keep quiet . " Ryan sat , letting his eyes adjust . A thin strip of light sneaked underneath the door . Heavy curtains blocked light from outside . Ryan held his hand in front of his face but could barely see it . The other kid 's voice startled him . He had n't expected the voice of a girl . Judd , Lionel , and Vicki hurried back to Northwest Community Hospital through massive traffic jams . Smoke still hung in the air . Emergency crews picked through the rubble looking for survivors . Though there were scores of emergency vehicles and hundreds of people , an eerie silence hung over the search . Judd explained their situation to a guard . " Did anyone inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , " the guard said . " Only others I know of were three women on their smoke break outside . They were taken to Lutheran General . " " Maybe one of them saw Ryan , " Lionel said . " Let 's go . "
