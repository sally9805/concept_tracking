A question keeps bugging me . Why have I been rooting for Howard Dean to win the Democratic nomination ? I 'm not a Democrat or even , in contemporary parlance , a liberal . In pure policy terms , I 'm probably closer to John Kerry and John Edwards . What 's more , Dean 's insistence that war against Saddam was wrong strikes me as morally and strategically misguided . His loose accusations of lying in the White House , his airing of notions that George W. Bush had a warning about 9/11 , his bad temper and his occasional nastiness are all reasons to back his opponents . <P> So why do I keep coming back to the fireplug from Vermont ? No , I 'm not cynically trying to engineer a Bush landslide . And , no , it 's not because John Kerry seems such a tired and faded figure ( although that 's part of it ) . I just think that the Democrats ' sudden panic about Dean 's electability is overblown and that the urge to find someone more superficially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help the Democrats in November ( I do n't know any Democrats who are actually excited about Kerry ) , and it will deny all of us a real debate about the future direction of the country . <P> Dean offers , to purloin a phrase , a choice , not an echo . His pugnacity in defense of his liberal instincts is obviously genuine . After eight years of careful Clintonian positioning , it 's refreshing . Compared with Kerry 's packaged , tested , hollow rants against " special interests , " Dean 's straight talk is invigorating . He is n't haunted , as Kerry is , by the specter of Vietnam . Even the famous Iowa scream had more authenticity and fire than Kerry 's labored recitation " Bring it on . " Unlike Kerry , Dean has held a serious executive office  --  balancing budgets , reforming health care , innovating on civil rights . Kerry 's undistinguished , flip-floppy Senate record is far less impressive . <P> Is Dean too extreme ? On the critical matter of national security , Dean has a more defensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Kerry could n't bring himself to do , and the Afghanistan war . His opposition to the Iraq campaign is less a function of knee-jerk isolationism or even left-wing pacifism than a pragmatic judgment about how to fight best . No , alas , he 's no Joe Lieberman in the war on terrorism . But his character suggests far more backbone in foreign affairs than does Kerry 's Hamlet-like anguish and spin . I do n't see Dean as President caving in to Jacques Chirac . And Dean could also save the Democrats from a left-wing split . In 2000 Al Gore lost in part because of the far-left Ralph Nader challenge . Dean has managed to bring these voters back into the fold  --  without making any drastic policy commitments that could come back to haunt him . Kerry in comparison ? Gore redux.
