I 'm superstitious . I admit it . I have a lot of superstitions . Some of them are pretty standard ; others might be all my own . Now and then I get a new one ; I do n't know how this happens . It just shows up one day , like a moth hole in a sweater . But , though new ones come , the old ones never go away . They just accumulate . <p> Most of the time I do n't mind my superstitions . I actually sort of like them ; they 're like tiny warning signs that help me navigate the real and imagined dangers of the day . Sometimes , though , I wish my superstitions were n't there . It would be nice to believe that life and people are more reasonable than that . But life is n't , and people are n't , and that 's just how it is . <p> On the day that set the stage for my association with Robert Maxx , I woke up at an unlucky time . Given my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special in the morning . So I seldom set an alarm clock . But , as the old saying goes , habits are the shackles of the free , and my habits shackle me plenty . Alarm clock or no , I almost always wake up between 7 and 7:30 . That morning , I cracked an eye and the first thing I saw was 7:13 . <p> I slammed my eyes shut quickly , but not so fast that I could kid myself that I had n't seen the dreaded number . I lay in bed until I was sure that at least a full minute had passed , then I knocked wood to counteract the effect of having seen the inauspicious digits , and only then did I get up . <p> Considering the lousy start , the morning went okay . I made coffee , read the paper , pissed around with a little essay about the creative use of boredom . Then the phone rang . Before I answered it , I looked down at the clock in the bottom corner of the computer screen . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call was from my agent , Paul Hannaford . I love Paul . We 've been together for a dozen years , through thick and thin , though most of the thick part was a while ago . What I cherish and admire about Paul is his ability to live and function in a constant and unremitting state of unspoken conflict . At heart , my agent is a profound pessimist , a man of serene dejection whose worldly disillusionment is so thoroughly ingrained as to seem almost French . He knows deep down that most books wo n't sell , that reviewers will generally be invidious and snide , that publishers will often break promises . He accepts these things without umbrage or surprise . At the same time , in his role as a salesman , a peddler of goods , he has no choice but to be cheery , optimistic , upbeat , to do that whole Willy Loman thing complete with the smile and the shoeshine . He 's very good at this , and I have no idea how he does it . His looks probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scattering of yachtsman 's freckles , and while he must be in his early forties , he could pass for twenty-eight . <p> In any case , I looked away from the computer clock , knocked wood again , and said hello . <p> " David , " Paul said , " got a minute ? I just had an interesting call from Marcie Kanin over at Porter . " <p> My ears perked up . I 've known Paul long enough to understand that the word interesting in this context is his code for the possibility of money changing hands . It 's not a usage I 'd heard very often lately . " Talk to me , " I said . <p> " She wanted to know if you 're available . I played it coy , let her think you might be drowning in offers . " <p> I said , " Maybe I would be if I had a better agent . " <p> " You might be drowning . But it would n't be in offers . You know Marcie ? " <p> I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small village , and if you stick around awhile and do n't get fired once too many times , you 'll pretty much meet everybody , generally over lunches that are all the same . They start with rather stilted chitchat before looking at the menu , then move on to a main course of industry gossip and schadenfreude , which leads in due course to that deflating moment over demitasse when editor and writer gaze hopefully at each other and realize more or less simultaneously that the other has not brought a brilliant book idea to the table . <p> " Well , no matter , " Paul said . " You 'll like her . She 's a grown-up and a survivor . And she just got into business with Robert Maxx . " He put an almost salacious breathiness into the mention of the name , then let it hang suspended for a moment . <p> If I was supposed to be instantly impressed , I was n't . " Robert Maxx ? Oh , great . There 's a prestige project . Musings of a fucking egomaniac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . It 's like graffiti at a higher economic level . " <p> " David , " he said , " Robert Maxx 's name recognition is right up there with the president 's . He can get on Oprah with a phone call . Larry King begs him to appear . " <p> " Okay . Big celebrity . But he does schmucky business books . Crap for middle managers and neo-yuppies . I do n't want to do that . Get some hack from BusinessWeek . " <p> " Marcie does n't want just any hack . She wants a hack who can tell a story . " <p> " Is that supposed to be flattering ? " <p> " I 've done some homework . Over the last twenty years , Maxx has published half a dozen books , each one with a different ghost . They 've all been bestsellers , but every one has sold fewer copies than the last . What does that say to you ? " <p> " For starters , " I said , " it tells me he 's either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Probably both , " Paul admitted . " But that 's not the point . The point is that there 's magic in his name . Always has been , always will be . But the straight business-book vein was tapped out years ago . Marcie wants this to be a different kind of book .
