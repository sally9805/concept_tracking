You might not expect much controversy from a strenuously reverent film adaptation of some famous chapters from the all-time best-selling book , one found in most homes , churches and hotel rooms . But with mouthy Mel Gibson as the auteur and the Gospels as his text , The Passion of the Christ has stoked a holy word war of an intensity not seen since Martin Scorsese 's The Last Temptation of Christ in 1988 . <P> Let 's start by saying that this is a movie , and that it has the same right to take the Bible literally as other films have to be comically blasphemous . Faith and piety are so often mocked in modern pop culture that Gibson could seem a radical just for approaching the Gospels with a straight face . The director , who won a Best Picture Oscar for Braveheart , has put his money ( $30 million ) where his faith is . In dramatizing the torment of Jesus ' last 12 hours , he has made a serious , handsome , excruciating film that radiates total commitment . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncompromising a production . Whatever the ultimate verdict on Gibson 's Passion , it 's hard not to admire Gibson 's passion . <P> Or his artistry . The film , photographed by Caleb Deschanel ( The Black Stallion , The Right Stuff , Gibson 's The Patriot ) , is an attractive clash of eerie blues in the outdoor night scenes , burnished umbers in the trial scenes and blistering whites and yellows on the road to Calvary . The cast , led by James Caviezel as a gaunt , haunted Jesus , is well chosen and smartly directed . The screenplay , by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald , begins starkly in the Garden of Olives  --  no loaves and fishes , no wedding feast at Cana  --  but adds nonbiblical flashbacks to Jesus ' idyllic childhood with his beloved mother Mary ( powerfully embodied by Maia Morgenstern ) . It also visualizes Satan ( Rosalinda Celentano ) as an androgynous creature , a Gollum with weird sex appeal , who slithers through the crowd , working infernal mischief . <P> Is the film anti-Jewish ? Well , which Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Jesus guilty of violating temple law and handed him to the Roman authority for summary punishment . The rabbis had their reasons ; they saw the upstart as dangerous , blasphemous , possibly insane for proclaiming himself the Messiah and telling his followers they would live forever if they ate his flesh and drank his blood . The film sees the rabbis as doctrinally pure but politically corrupt . Indeed , it suggests they are a rogue cell calling a midnight caucus for a frame-up . But Gibson also shows many Jews ( and no Romans ) treating Jesus with a kindness and charity one might call Christian . We acknowledge , then , that The Passion is rabidly anti-Sanhedrin  --  opposed , as Jesus and other Jews were , to the Establishment of the time . But to charge the film with being anti-Semitic is like saying those who oppose the Bush Administration 's Iraq policy are anti-American.
