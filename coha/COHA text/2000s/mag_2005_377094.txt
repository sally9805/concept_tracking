There are n't many head-to-head studies of brand-name diet regimens , and now we know why . When scientists assigned 160 overweight or obese adults to one of four diets  --  Atkins , Ornish , Weight Watchers or Zone  --  the results were hardly dramatic . After a year of dieting , the average weight loss for women was about 5 lbs . and for men about 6.5 lbs .  --  and it did n't matter much which diet they were on . Perhaps the most significant finding was how many test subjects dropped out : half of the Atkins and Ornish groups , a third of Weight Watchers and Zone . The best bet , say the researchers , is to pick a diet with food choices you can live with .  --  By David Bjerklie
