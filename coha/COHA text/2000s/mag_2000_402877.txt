Section : My Brush with History <p> One friday , November 22 , 1963 , I was in the fifth month of my cardiology fellowship at Bethesda Naval Hospital on the northern edge of the District of Columbia . As I stepped into the hallway at 1:45 P.M. , I noticed a small group by the mailroom window listening intently to a radio broadcast . We heard the awful news of President Kennedy 's shooting . <p> Around four o'clock we received word that President Johnson was returning immediately to Washington . Since he had suffered a heart attack in 1955 while Senate majority leader , it seemed wise to send a cardiologist in a Navy ambulance down to Andrews Air Force Base to be at the disposal of the President 's physician . Our small cardiology staff gathered about a table . Each of my seniors appeared to have a pressing engagement , and I became aware that all eyes were fixed on me . I volunteered to go . <p> The Beltway would not be finished for months yet , so we made our way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver , a nurse , and I , with my state-of-the-art black bag . Looking back , one can appreciate how optimistically we were prepared . Soon after we parked inside the fence at the base one of Kennedy 's staff came by . He explained that they might not be able to transport the body by helicopter and asked to use our ambulance . By then we knew that President Johnson was in no difficulty , so I promptly agreed . We pulled up to the front of the line of cars just before Air Force One landed . <p> The plane pulled up . A back door opened , and the casket was carried onto the ramp truck . Our ambulance backed up to the truck . I stepped out and looked up at a scene I shall never forget : the bronze casket of the President flanked by his brother and his magnificent wife in her bloodstained dress . <p> Life magazine published a photograph ( seen above ) showing a dazed young naval officer in the front seat of the ambulance peering over his shoulder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Robert just behind her . A staff member explained that she wanted to accompany the body to Bethesda . The nurse and I quickly offered our seats . <p> That raised the practical matter of just how we would get back to the hospital  --  until a thoughtful aide offered us a ride in a White House limousine . Thus occurred a second never-to-be-forgotten image : the solemn , silent groups of people leaning over the railings of the overpasses as our procession made its way to the National Naval Medical Center .  --  C. Charles Welch , M.D. , practices cardiology part-time in Temple , Texas . Cat and Mouse <p> In October 1962 I was a sonarman on board the destroyer USS Waller , home-ported in Norfolk , Virginia . Our duty was antisubmarine warfare training in the Cape Hatteras area , which meant we were out two weeks and in two weeks . Suddenly all leaves and liberties were canceled . There was activity all over the base , and ships began loading stores , ammunition , and fuel around the clock . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Sal tended to be an alarmist , so we paid him little attention . Instead we believed this was a large exercise , as we 'd been told . Within a couple of days we were under way with Task Group Alfa , led by the carrier USS Randolph . <p> The weather was bad as we met several troop transports off Moorehead City , North Carolina . We were steaming " condition III "  --  men at battle stations  --  and were told that submarines and surface ships would try to penetrate our screen during this " exercise . " Sal continued to insist that something was up : too many brass were at sea at one time . <p> At quarters on the main deck next to the forward five-inch mount one morning the weather broke slightly , and Sal spied something on the horizon . It was a task group as large as ours . The division officer explained it as the ships that would be trying to break our screen . Sal did n't buy it . An unusual thing about this " exercise " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conditions  --  which was dangerous . Because of the number of ships involved , it took all night . <p> Contrary to what you see in movies , the skipper never spoke to us over the public-address system on our ship . Then one day the word was passed : " Now hear this . Stand by to hear from the captain . " We were stunned , but more amazing is what he said . " This is the captain speaking . Stand by to hear from the Commander in Chief . " Then we heard President Kennedy make the announcement the whole country was hearing : The Soviets were building missile bases in Cuba capable of launching nuclear strikes against the United States , and we were going to respond by turning back all ships carrying military equipment to the island . During his speech our ship was taking up station on the line . Sal reminded us strongly what he had told us . <p> All combat ships have lists of landing and boarding parties , which are usually just formalities until something serious occurs . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted , and I found myself assigned to the landing party as the machine-gun squad leader . I had replaced an officer in this position , and when I asked the officer how I could stand in for him , he answered , " Who could this ship better afford to lose , a petty officer or a division officer ? " <p> Tension was high as Soviet freighters continued to approach ; scuttlebutt had it that Soviet cruisers and destroyers were escorting them . Then one of our U-2s was shot down , killing the Air Force major Rudolf Anderson , Jr . The situation seemed to be deteriorating . When the USS Joseph P. Kennedy , Jr . intercepted and boarded a freighter , I remember thinking politics were everywhere ; I was sure that this ship had made the first stop because of its name . <p> One night on the mid-watch things got hot . Scanning my sector , I picked up a sonar contact . We were carefully trained in how to decipher different contacts  --  whales , shipwrecks , schools of fish . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure when contact is established is to immediately report loud and clear into the sound-powered phones , regardless of traffic , " Sonar contact , " giving the bearing and range . General quarters was sounded , and the ship began closing on the target . Since my GQ station was the sonar shack , I did n't move but stayed glued to my post . <p> The sub made some initial evasive maneuvers , but we were on him . Then he attempted to fool us by lying still . The captain ordered me to send a message : " India , Delta Kelo Alfa , " international Morse code for " Surface on an easterly course . " After what seemed like an eternity , the captain ordered the gunnery officer , who was right next to me , to send the same message . Still no movement . <p> A gunner 's mate was sent to the main deck with a case of hand grenades and told to drop one . I knew that as soon as it detonated , it would mask the target and I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hear a thing , but I kept the cursor trained to the last-known position and listened as hard as I could . The captain ordered a second grenade dropped . No movement . A third grenade . <p> There must be an unwritten international law of " three strikes and you 're out , " because shortly after the third explosion I detected Doppler : The sub was coming up . The Soviet captain , I thought , had made the right decision : If depth charges followed the grenades , he would never come up . <p> Before long radar had the sub on the surface . Three other destroyers joined us , and we began escorting this threat out of the area . It was daylight now , and the gunnery officer told me to go topside and take a look at what I had got . After playing cat and mouse with this submarine all night , it was very strange to see it a couple of hundred yards away . The four " cans " steamed in circles around it as we all headed east . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we crossed their bow , they would n't give us the satisfaction of looking at us ; they kept their eyes straight ahead . <p> We stayed with that sub for a day or so before returning to our station . A few days later we received word that the Soviet freighters heading for Cuba had stopped and were beginning to turn back . Khrushchev must have realized there was no way the missiles would be allowed to stay in place . <p> Many years afterward I learned that six submarines had been forced to the surface during the crisis . Looking back almost 40 years later , I feel privileged to have been a part of the action . Those weeks were arguably the most dangerous in the history of humankind , and all concerned were cool and professional enough to keep the lid on . After being trained in a particular area of Cold War strategy , I was one of the few able to put the instruction to the test in a real situation . And nobody was hurt . Thank God .  --  Ed Spagnolo lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business for more than 25 years . Holding the Baby <p> Calling it simply Physics spoke volumes . As a freshman on the campus of Iowa State University in 1983 , I always enjoyed that squat brick building . The wooden floors in the foyer creaked as you entered , waking the sullen graduate students slumped over study tables , probably occupying the same chairs since the night before . The foyer led directly to a large lecture hall with tiny desks that never quite accommodated a notebook . It was the essence of the college experience . <p> The poorly lit old building seemed to harbor secrets in every dark corner . Just inside the door was a small poster trumpeting the creation of the first digital computer , the ABC , by Prof. John V. Atanasoff and his graduate student Clifford Berry . <p> Amazing ! I thought , and I set off to find it . I scoured the building from top to bottom , even sneaking through a basement door that should have been locked . I found nothing . A professor I asked about it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no help either . All the reference books listed John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert from the University of Pennsylvania as the inventors of the computer . <p> A few years later , when I myself was a grad student , I came across a book titled Atanasoff , Forgotten Father of the Computer , by Clark Mollenhoff . I bought it on the spot . I learned that Atanasoff had explained his idea for a digital computer to Mauchly at a conference and that the two men had met at Iowa State afterward . Mauchly had been a guest at Atanasoff 's home and studied what would come to be called the ABC computer that he and Berry had built in the Physics Building . <p> The problem was that Atanasoff was denied a patent for his machine . Still , Honeywell began a lengthy legal battle against Mauchly , using Atanasoft as a star witness , and finally won in 1973 . By that time , though , the point was moot . The history books had been written and had passed him by . <p> One wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot between the library and a construction site . Reaching my apartment , I dropped onto the broken-down sofa and flipped on my tiny television . There , live on the screen , was John Atanasoff . The new computing center , the muddy hole I had just passed , was about to be dedicated in his name . I sat up quickly and thought about rushing back , but I did n't . Why ? <p> Because even if I did manage to meet the man , how could it mean anything to me when it would mean nothing to him ? I would be just one of a crowd . Maybe more important , I was annoyed with him . Being an engineer myself , I knew that good ideas should never be left to languish . Atanasoff 's handling of his own patent work had been lackadaisical . The memory drum from his computer had ended up as a footstool ! He had not appreciated what he had created , and the great honor that could have been Iowa State 's was gone . <p> Three people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamer who envisions it , the pragmatist who makes it work , and the salesperson who realizes its potential . Atanasoff may have been the dreamer , but it was Berry ( and later Eckert ) who built it and Mauchly who saw what the idea meant . How sad that they could not find the grace to work together . I did n't want to see Atanasoff . Nor would I have wanted to meet Mauchly , embittered after losing the lawsuit , or Berry , who committed suicide , perhaps upon realizing what he had missed out on . What did I want ? <p> I headed back toward the muddy parking lot , passed it by , and reentered the library . At the archives desk I asked for a listing of papers by J. V. Atanasoff . Amazingly there it was . I was shocked that it was not locked in a glass case , and even more shocked that the archivist simply handed it over to me . Hand-typed paper yellowed by almost 50 years . Hand drawings , black-and-white photographs pasted onto the paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could understand it . The poetry of holding something that had launched the computer revolution washed over me . I took a deep breath , and I had what I wanted : the smell of coffee brewing in the kitchen late at night as Atanasoff and Mauchly excitedly pored over these pages ; the sound of crickets chirping under the stars on a still , sticky summer night ; the birth of an idea that would change the world . I saw it .  --  Kevin J.
