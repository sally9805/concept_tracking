The Patient Shes waiting out a sudden shower of fifty kilo bags of rice , a gathered clutch of angry chickens flapping like their heads are off . Its raining rolls of razor wire and wooden crates of tangerines , a blood-red set of luggage for a couple on their honeymoon . The driver honked through eighteen hours of blindly climbing hairpin turns ; the bus hit every dog that dared to cross the road from Chandigarh . Marys so exhausted she can barely stand among the crowd - shes praying that her bags are there , the one box in particular . At last she sees her canvas duffel sailing through the mountain air ; she waves and yells to get the man to treat her box more carefully . But his ropy muscles flex and stretch across his shirtless arms and back , the sun gleams off the lines of sweat that trickle down his dusty flank . He does n't look or heed her shout before he drops it to the ground - the box lands in the mud and dust : the sparkling sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shes swallowing her rising bile : stupid idiot ! she thinks , though not referring to the man . She feels like everything shes touched has shattered in the past six months ; ca n't even get a goddamn-box of medicines down off a bus . She knows that things are different here , shes not back home in Baltimore , but seven thousand feet above the plains of Northern India . The sun is beaming overhead , the sky the blue of early May ; a soft breeze swings the evergreens , the mountains oh-so-beautiful . But the bus keeps belching diesel smoke and noise so she ca n't concentrate ; three men are shouting in her face , each claiming his hotel is best . She 'd like to turn around and leave , go find someplace to sit and cry - shes desperate for a private place to drop her pants around her knees . She has to shift from foot to foot , she has n't gone since yesterday ; the few times that the driver stopped , there was n't any ladies room . Every muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden shooting , stabbing pains enough to take her breath away . The closest man before her has a cancer growing on his lip ; in all her years of practice she has never seen one half as big . Trying not to stare she shouts , " I 'm staying at the hospital ! " She sees the hope drop from his face , the pearly tumor glistening . The three men turn away as she attempts to gather up her bags ; she thought , perhaps , there 'd be somebody waiting for her when she came . She feels like she ca n't focus , like theres nothing under her control : a nauseating moment when she steps in something soft and dull . A half a dozen porters want to help her with her duffel bag , but all she sees are wasted arms on men who must weigh less than her . She does n't want to feel this way , she thought that she had come prepared : she read the books and travel guides , the passages on culture shock . But shes never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shes following her husbands ghost that led her to this wretched town . She makes herself meet one mans eyes , a porter with a crooked smile , her random choice because his shirts the only one not torn with holes . They are high up in a little town where tourists come to see the snow ; the valley walls with peaks of ice are lined with fruiting apple trees . Her map shows that the road ends here , the last real town before the pass - further north are only arid mountains going on and on . But this towns rimmed by forests filled with evergreen deodar trees that rise up from the duff to try to imitate the mountain peaks . The buildings stand two stories high , their walls are mortared brick and stone ; the town is just a couple blocks of alleyways and market stalls . The alley that they 're walking down is filled with tourists from the plains : long-haired Western travelers and newlyweds with hennaed hands . The hotel signs are lettered in a half a dozen languages : Stay Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Hindi , English , French and several others she ca n't recognize . But Mary does n't have the time or energy to look about for anything except a place to let her aching bladder down . She 'd like a clean , well-lighted place where she could trust them with her bags , a disinfected toilet and a sink to wash her face and hands . Nothing looks too promising , the storefronts are all dark inside , the sidewalk lined with metal plates on stoves of hissing kerosene . These sizzling grills are saucer-shaped and large enough to sled on snow ; she feels the spit of grease from brown samosas fried in smoking oil . She braced herself for beggars , but the impact is still visceral : a woman without legs has propped herself against a crumbling wall . On whats left of her lap she holds a plump and squirming two year old who vigorously sucks beneath a coarsely woven woolen shawl . This woman looks at Mary so their eyes meet for the briefest time - Mary has to look away or risk another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all shouting at her constantly - demand that she must stop and buy their cabbages and tangerines . And she 'd like to pass this holy man , this baba smeared with human ash , whos blocking half the sidewalk as he browses through the marketplace . His begging bowl is pounded brass , his trident staff is tipped with bone ; he has n't got a stitch of clothes but dreadlocks filled with marigolds . She does n't try to pass because she 'd likely bump him with her bag - afraid she 'd have to buy the goat he 'd need for cleansing sacrifice . But then she sees a little cafe up another alleyway , a landmark from the photos that she memorized in Baltimore . It was where her husband took his meals , back a dozen years ago , Himalayan Dhaba painted on the sign above the door . It does n't look much better than the other cafes that shes seen : built from poorly mortared brick , tiny windows thick with grease . She motions to the porter that she wants him to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll stay and guard her box and bags . She drops her backpack on the ground and feels a wave of urgency ; she rushes through the cafe door and almost knocks the waiter down . He s a short and slender walleyed man dressed neatly in a Nehru suit - shes shocked to recognize his face , from another photo Richard kept . The picture shows her husband with his arm around this gentleman : Richard has a goofy smile , the waiters eyes look here and there . The cafe is so dark inside she has to strain to look around : the room is twenty feet across , the tables do n't look very clean . The cafes barely half full with a funny mix of clientele ; suddenly shes thinking that she should have looked around some more . Everyone has turned to stare ; she feels a dozen sets of eyes : a ragged Western traveler , an Indian in suit and tie . She asks this man her husband knew : please , could she use the ladies room ? He bows to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend . " Mr saath aa-i-y , " he says and gently takes her arm , leads her down the center of this darkly paneled restaurant . The room is close and filled with smoke , she smells the faintest hint of dope ; the waiter guides her through the darkness toward the swinging door in back . He points her to a closet that smells like an open septic tank - ripping at her belt she barely gets her pants down fast enough . The only light comes through a tiny window high up over head , and there is n't any toilet but a hole cut in the concrete floor . Shes focusing on balance , trying to keep her pants up off the ground - horrified she 'll tumble over , unsure where shes supposed to aim . At last her bladders letting down , her feet not quite spread wide enough ; her passport safe around her waist now jabbing in her pancreas . She 'd made a promise to herself she would n't cry for two more days ; tears have come so quickly ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down her cheeks , along the crease beside her nose , dripping from her chin into this hole between her hiking boots . Shes worried that the porter wo n't be outside when shes finished here , and worried that shes never going to find the mission hospital . Shes not sure why shes doing this , except her husband loved it here - shes thinking she should turn around for safe and sterile Baltimore . But theres nothing for her there now that shes left her home and quit her job , sold her house and practice in a clinic for the very old . She knows she 'll find the hospital , it ca n't be very far away , and if the porter steals her bags she 'll buy some other clothes to wear . There is n't any paper so she zippers up her wrinkled pants - does n't trust the water in the pail to give her hands a wash . She wipes her eyes off with her sleeves , takes a breath of fetid air . She shakes her head and wonders what-the-hell she thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sunlight bouncing off the dust , and Mary has to squint to see , the restaurant was dark as night . The porter is still waiting with her bags beneath the dhabas sign ; she tells him with her red-rimmed eyes that shes feeling better than before . Now that she has peed and cried and has n't lost all her supplies , this tiny village does n't seem as awful as at first it had . The porter has a friendly face , his eyes are sparkling with life ; she shows him once again the name of Doctor Vikram 's hospital . She knows its likely he ca n't read , especially her English script ; his head moves in a way that Mary ca n't quite tell is no or yes . So she mimes as if she has a cough , walks like someone with a limp , finally rifles through a bag , pulls out her shiny stethoscope . The porter rolls his eyes and laughs , her destination obvious . " Achhaa-ji , " he says , and picks up Doctor Marys dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't very far at all ; he takes her down a winding maze of gravel paths and alleyways . As they walk shes looking round , a half a world away from home ; she watches someone scrub a pot with dirt scraped straight up off the ground . But the sky today is cloudless and shes almost at her journeys end , anxious to meet Doctor Vikram , another one of Richards friends . Shes having a rare moment of her optimism blossoming : maybe she will like it here , this busy little tourist town . Her husband talked about this place , he worked here when he finished school : spent two months in these mountains just before they met in internship . He 'd told her of the hospital , of Doctor Vikram Vargeela , a man from Southern India who runs the place all by himself . Richard called the man a saint , said Vikram had a magic touch - so long as you ignored the surgeons tendency to preach too much . Rich said the place was beautiful with lovely terraced valley walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . But he did n't mention how it smells , the nasty open-sewer stink , the beggars with their pleading palms and exudative skin disease . This is why shes come here , though , so useless since her husbands death : her love cut down in prime of life , a stupid biking accident . She cried herself to sleep for weeks , then made herself go back to work ; just could n't care enough about her aging patients chief complaints . Her partners bought her practice for a price that was quite generous ; she banked it with the million from the life insurance Richard kept . She contemplated suicide , but was n't really serious ; she tried to think what Rich would do if she had been the one to die . Thats when Vikrams card came with his yearly Christmas newsletter which hinted for donations for his hospital in India . A way to keep her husband near , it felt like such a good idea : supplies are low , the wards are full , could use a doctor volunteer . The compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grass - she recognizes everything from Richards color photographs . The buildings have n't changed at all , with roofs of rusty village tin , the windows glazed with wavy glass , the walls in need of plastering . She thought that this would feel familiar , as if she 'd been up here before , but really it was Rich who worked here back a dozen years ago . Like all the buildings in this town , they 're brick and rock and wooden beams - a painted sign in English points the way to the X-ray machine . The wards are both two stories high with wooden stairs and balconies , the courtyard beaten free of grass by years of patients trampling feet . In the center of the yard there is a stunning , ancient walnut tree : massive trunk and spreading limbs , its canopy blocks out the sky . The porter drops her bags beneath it , speaks to her in Kullui ; Mary does n't know the coins so lets the porter keep the change . The man gives her his crooked smile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one step back before he turns to take his leave . The hospital is tiny , with the buildings scattered randomly , dwarfed from east and west by massive Himalayan mountain peaks . She smells the sweet deodar smoke of someone cooking over fire , reminding her of camping in the pines of western Maryland . She wonders where the patients are , the lines that Richard once described - Vikram wrote that there was never time enough to see them all . It is sometime in the afternoon , perhaps the staff has gone to lunch ; she set her watch in Delhi , though she could have turned the dial wrong . But someone should be hanging round , she knows they are expecting her ; she sent a message yesterday : arriving soon as possible . The last time Vikram wrote he said theres always so much work to do - the clinic runs four days a week , with surgery the other two . Sunday is his day of rest , he preaches in the little church ; she sees the tiny , empty building : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day it is , she left the States on Saturday ; spent one night in the Delhi Hiltons musty air conditioning . Shes guessing that its Tuesday and it must be close to three o'clock - unlikely Doctor Vikram would take off to play a round of golf . So she leaves her bags beneath the tree with leaves the green of early spring , and wanders through the courtyard , through the echoing dispensary . The only sound she hears is someones distant whistle off somewhere . She follows it in through a door , a painted sign to Surgery . The hall is almost black inside , the walls are stacked with limp supplies : boxes with their lids cut off , the dust has never been disturbed . Shes thinking its incredible , the storerooms loaded with antiques : surgical contraptions no ones used in half a century . She takes a cloth mask from a bin and holds it to her mouth and nose , then opens up a door thats marked the entrance to the surgery . It should be draped with braided rope , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet and volatile . The table has a dozen cranks , a sheet draped over stainless steel ; above it hangs an ancient lamp : a giant metal buttercup . Nobodys there , but still she hears the funny , tuneless whist ling - and then a ringing echoed laugh , a soft and high-pitched giggle . It comes out from a little room , the next door that she opens up ; she finds a tiny woman , someone Richard once had talked about . " Doctor-ji ! Namast ! " At last someone expecting her ; she sent a photo of herself and Richard the first time she wrote . Padma ca n't be four feet tall , her body nearly bent in half : Rich had said he liked her best of all the people working there . Mary is amazed at how she looks just like her photograph : tiny little angel face and eyes benignly mischievous . Her spine has got a nasty twist , perhaps a childhood accident , but Marys never seen a face as beautiful and radiant . Padma climbs down off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood off rubber gloves so that they can be used again . She wangs her hands before her face : palms together , fingers straight ; a man stands from a wooden bench : he s the source of all the whistling . She wonders if this could be Vikram - pleasant smile and slender hips - but he has n't got the features of a man from Southern India . His face is more Tibetan-shaped , his eyes a little wide apart ; in very broken English he says Tamding is his given name . Mary only knows a couple phrases of the dialect , studied from a worthless book , a numbing set of language tapes . Shes not sure what his job is but he does what Padma tells him to : he helps her with her bags and shows her to the rooms that shes to have . They cross the dusty courtyard past the one-room missionary school ; Tamding might be speaking English , but she does n't know for sure . He s pointing out the landmarks , making jutting gestures with his chin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leads her to a building that could be a mom-and-pop motel : single-story cinderblock with doors all lined up in a row . Shes got the last rooms on the end , the farthest from the hospital ; Tamding opens up the door and shows her where shes going to live . This wo n't do at all , she thinks , her heart drops down another inch : the walls a shade of green like something growing in a swimming pool . She tries to see her husband here , how Richard thought it wonderful ; the bed a musty block of foam , the kitchen does n't have a stove ; she looks into the bathroom : just another hole where shes to go . Tamding brings her bags inside and stacks them neat against the wall , wangs his hands before his face and goes out backwards through the door . Shes glad , at least , to be alone , to have some time to recompose ; her stomach gripped with anxious fear , she thinks this was a bad idea . Richard was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of man who needed to be comfortable . She wants her husband desperately , perhaps she would relax a bit : he 'd take her out exploring , wander through the winding market place . She lies down on the bed but ca n't relax enough to fall asleep ; she wonders if the water in the tap is safe to brush her teeth . The only nice thing in the room is a sunny wooden window seat that overlooks an alley with a glimpse of snowy mountain peak . She pulls the curtains back to let some light into this gloomy space , wanders through the tiny kitchen , sniffs a hint of rat perfume . Then on a table by the bed she finds a letter with her name , held down at one corner with a textbook as a paper weight . She looks first at the massive tome , the English title on the spine : General Practice Guidelines for the Rural District Hospital . She flips through several pages filled with pictures of advanced disease : liver cysts from parasites shes hoping that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much help with everything so different here - Richard was the surgeon , could have operated anywhere . But Mary is an internist , knows medicines and lab reports : a specialist in geriatrics , treating grandpas gout and stroke . She opens up the envelope , her name spelled in a hasty hand ; it takes some time to read the words , decipher Vikrams doctor-scratch . At first she does n't understand , she has to guess some of the words ; but then it all comes clear why there were n't patients at the hospital . And she thought that she hit bottom when she saw where shes supposed to live , but now she knows her heart can sink at least another couple feet . Shes thinking now would be the time to quietly just disappear , leave a note for Vikram on the box of shattered medicines . But then she hears the whistling , the flute of Tamdings puckered lips - he s knocking nonstop on her door until she starts to open it . Breathlessly he s talking in a language she ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quickly follow him . With no idea whats going on , shes led across the hard dirt yard ; shes running through a list of what might be the worst that she could find . Shes thinking its a heart attack , a motorcycle accident - someone with a bleeding cut , an artery thats gushing blood . They cross beneath the walnut tree , the speckled light of twitching leaves ; he leads her to a room that smells of nasty disinfectant spray . But no ones on the table that is centered in the trauma room , just a woman on a bench , a bundle cradled in her arms . The bundles covered with a shawl and Marys trying to catch her breath ; the woman looks up briefly but then turns her eyes away . The womans dressed in local clothes , a pattu made of homespun wool , a scarf ties back her long black hair , silver hoops pierced through her nose . And Tamdings somehow disappeared so Marys not sure where he s gone - does n't even know exactly why he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is n't in her long white coat ; she could n't even start to ask the questions that a doctor must . Shes trying to imagine what required her so urgently ; this woman is n't bleeding , is n't writhing round in agony . Mary tries to guess her age - she could be forty-five years old , she could be half of that but Mary finds it difficult to tell . Right then the woman looks at her , the saddest eyes shes ever seen ; now Mary understands what made them call for her so urgently . Her heart skips several beats at first , a lump forms large inside her throat ; she motions to the mother that she 'd like to take a closer look . The mother pulls the shawl back so that Mary sees the babys face - Mary has to swallow hard to keep her gasp from being heard . The baby looks a hundred years , with sagging skin across the face : sunken eyes and fontanel , breathing at too slow a rate . She has n't got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she takes the baby from the mom as if she holds a hand grenade . With the baby on the table , she unwraps the musty woolen shawl ; the skin hangs down like melted wax : a dying little baby girl . Her eyes are dry and glazed as if she has n't blinked since she was born ; does n't cry or make a fuss , just stares and slowly gasps for air . In Baltimore there 'd be a dozen nurses working frantically : X-ray techs and lab reports and respiratory therapists . All she 'd have to do is give the orders to the nursing staff : stand and watch and make sure that the blood gets sent off fast enough . Mary has n't slept in days , her thinking is n't very clear : this baby is dehydrated , should get some fluids into her . Shes thinking meningitis , maybe H. flu septicemia : spinal tap and blood cultures ; X-ray and a white cell count . She needs an IV right away , she 'd like to put her on a vent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what noise she makes . She wants to know how long its been , how old this ancient baby is ; she needs to get the babys weight to calculate the fluid drip . At last she hears the whistling of Tamding coming back this way ; he steps in through the door and rattles something off in Kullui . She asks him for an IV drip ; he only shrugs and wags his head . Its obvious he does n't understand a word that Doctor Mary says . At last she hears another set of footsteps from across the yard - she sees a floating nurses cap come sailing past the window frame . The nurse who comes in through the door is not a day past seventeen : long black hair done in a braid , a ribbon tied-up in a bow . She says her name is Chidda and she 'll try to help the best she can ; the other nurses are at home , they were n't expecting her so soon . She says shes only worked a month , just graduated nursing school - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be pretty good . But Mary does n't have the time , this baby is about to die ; already diagnosed the nurses tendency to rattle on . " I 'm Doctor Mary Davis , " she says , cutting off the chattering ; starts listing off the things she 'll need : an IV and a catheter . Shes calculating in her head the dosages that she should give ; she needs antibiotics that will cross the blood/brain barrier . This infants running out of time , each breath could be her final gasp , and Mary is n't sure about the doses shes remembering . The nurse just stands in horror when she sees the withered infant girl , so Mary gets the feeling that this nurse wo n't do her any good . She starts into the list again , anxious that the work begin - mimes the way she 'd try to stick a needle in the babys vein . " If you ca n't help , I understand . Just find somebody else who can ! " The nurse then turns around and leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down then backs away , not volunteering for the job . Mary has n't started IVs since she finished Internship ; shes used to having IV techs and nurses with experience . She quickly asks for sterile gloves , a swab or two of Betadine ; she 'll need a couple culture jars , plus red and purple vacuum tubes . Marys nervous she wo n't find a vein before the baby dies ; asks then for a tourniquet to strap around the babys thigh . Shes slapping at the leg to see if she can raise a purple vein - baby so lethargic that the slapping does n't make her cry . She looks up at the nurse to see if she has brought the things she needs ; nurse is still just standing staring at the walnut tree outside . " I 'm sorry , " Chidda says this time , " but everybody else is gone . " The nurse sounds like shes going to cry - she says that she is all alone ; when Doctor Vikram left he said that they should close the hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Chandigarh , off to search for parts to fix the broken autoclave machine . They ca n't do any cultures since they have n't got a micro lab ; she thinks the spinal needles are still waiting to be sterilized . " And we do n't have any bata-deen . I 'm not sure what it is you need . " Marys hands are shaking , thinks this baby ca n't be three weeks old ; the baby does n't have the strength to keep on gasping any more . " I need something to clean the skin , " and Marys also on the verge ; shes slapping at the other leg , still desperate for a decent vein . Chidda brings a cotton ball thats soaked in something horrible ; slowly mops the knee and thigh till Mary knocks her hands away . The baby is so deep in shock her veins have all nearly collapsed ; with fingers trembling Mary blindly sticks the IV needle in . She knows that theres a big vein somewhere near the outside of the shin ; after several tries she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn it ! I need tape ! " she screams , her patience finally wearing out ; she knows this babys going to die and everything will be her fault . Vikrams letter said the staff would help her any way they could ; all she needs to do is ask : the nurses are all excellent . And this was what he 'd written in the letter underneath the book : that he would keep her in his prayers , that Richard would be proud of her . I 'm going home to Kerala . My father 's taken gravely ill . Ill be back in a month or so . The hospital depends on you . She knows that shes not up for this , she has n't got much in reserve - she came this far to find a ghost to hold her hand and comfort her . She looks down at this tiny girl , while Chidda draws the saline push ; this dying babys face holds all the sadness in the universe . She knows that she will have to stay , if only for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep this needle safe inside her vein .
