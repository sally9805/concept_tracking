If one of the greatest gifts is to discover early in life what you are meant to do , then Charles ( Chuck ) Kristensen , 49 , must be counted among the lucky ones . He found his calling in 1973 , at 22 , while working for an entomologist at the University of Minnesota . " I spent a lot of time watching spiders , " he recalls . All that webmaking , spider mating and insect catching resonated with something in his personality  --  he still ca n't say what . " It just nailed me , " he says . " I knew I would be working with spiders for the rest of my life . " <P> The evidence of Kristensen 's arachnophilia sits , silent and menacing , in thousands of plastic cups and modified deli containers in the basement of his unkempt and funky-smelling suburban house in Feasterville , Pa. , just north of Philadelphia . Arrayed on tray-size boards and more than 20 6-ft. - tall racks are some 50,000 living spiders representing dozens of species : sleek , lacquered western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Chile , even a fist-size , cocoa-brown African king baboon tarantula . <P> This is the livestock of Spider Pharm , a mom-and-pop operation that Kristensen began as a hobby in 1980 and that has since grown into the most active purveyor of spider venom in the world . <P> " Spider venom is a gold mine of pharmacological tools , " explains Michael Adams , a venom-using neuroscientist at the University of California at Riverside . The active compounds in venom bind with extreme selectivity to molecules on the surfaces of living cells , a property that can be of invaluable use to researchers developing new medicines with better specificity ( and thus fewer side effects ) or just trying to understand , at the molecular level , the inner workings of living cells . <P> A venom purchased from Kristensen in the 1980s , for example , helped neuroscientist Rodolfo Llinas of New York University School of Medicine discover a new calcium channel involved in the communication between certain neurons , shedding new light on how the mind works . Another toxin extracted from Spider Pharm venom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( named hanatoxin after Swartz 's daughter ) is being used to probe the function of proteins that are located on cellular membranes and have been implicated in diseases ranging from diabetes to epilepsy . <P> How does one extract venom from a tiny , delicate and perhaps deadly spider ? In a word : carefully . Kristensen and his wife Anita start by tranquilizing the specimen with a gentle breeze of carbon-dioxide gas from a cylinder behind the milking desk . Once the spider is groggy , the milker , peering through a low-power stereoscopic microscope , gently picks it up with metal tweezers that are connected to an electrical supply . When a mild shock is administered through the tweezers , the spider promptly spews up pretty much everything liquid inside it  --  including digestive enzymes . That was a problem early on , until Chuck devised a combined " mouthwash " and venom-collecting system that keeps the two fluids separated using a hollow suctioning needle and a miniature glass pipette .                  @ @ @
