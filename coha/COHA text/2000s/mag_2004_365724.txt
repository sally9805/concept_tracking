Howard Dean did n't get it . Al Gore had no clue . The high-tech secret weapon of this election is n't blogging or viral e-mail or any other sexy buzzwords . It 's something mundane and under the radar and totally unsexy : data . Both the Democrats and the Republicans have amassed vast secret databases of information about voters , which they jealously guard on the simple theory that the more you know about people , the easier it is to get their vote . <P> The Republicans began building their database , which they call Voter Vault , back in the mid-1990s . It 's no accident they got a head start : Bush adviser Karl Rove used to run a direct-mail company , so he knows the value of a few good leads . " We do n't say a lot about Voter Vault , " notes Christine Iverson , press secretary for the Republican National Committee . " A lot of the information is strategic , and the less the Democrats know the better . " Secret it may be , but Voter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans had  --  wait for it  --  outsourced some of its construction to a bunch of programmers in Maharashtra , India . <P> By 2001 , the Democrats  --  the party of would-be overnerd Al Gore  --  were staring at a data gap . All they had was a few tens of thousands of e-mail addresses stored on a computer so obsolete its monitor was green . So they hired a small firm called Plus Three to build them a database of their very own , which they named Demzilla . Voter Vault and Demzilla currently hold about 165 million entries each . <P> So what 's in these things ? Any information about you that the parties can legally get their hands on . They start with voter-registration records , which are rich in priceless personal data like phone numbers , home addresses and birthdays . That info gets cross-referenced with census data plus records the parties keep : who worked or volunteered for them , who donated money . Names in Demzilla typically have 200 to 400 pieces of info attached to them . <P> But the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there 's no quicker or cheaper way to get out the vote than by e-communicating directly with supporters . In addition , there may be magazine-subscription records , membership rosters from organizations like the AARP ... who knows ? The parties are n't saying . " We probably have more information about the average voter than they care for us to have , " admits Robert Bennett , chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio . <P> The more data the parties have , and the more ways they search , collate , cross-reference and puree them , using data-mining kung fu perfected by generations of direct marketers , the more precisely they can tailor their pitches to individual voters . Undecided black housewives under 35 will get very different phone calls from the Kerry campaign than Hispanic CEOs over 60 . Data mining also helps the parties find , and sway , those all-important swing voters . " Now we can identify individuals within a neighborhood , in a state , in a market , where we never would have gone and looked before , " says Juan Proao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close eye on your candidate , because you can be sure he 's keeping an eye on you  --  and on the competition . " The Democrats have typically not had a very good database , " the G.O.P. 's Iverson sniffs . " We 're very happy to take all the information they give out about Demzilla and absorb it .
