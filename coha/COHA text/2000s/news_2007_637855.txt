<p> Four starting pitchers reported for work at Yankee Stadium yesterday with a combined career record of 8-22 . As uncertain as the Yankees must have felt before their day-night doubleheader , it probably helped to remember who they were facing . <p> The pitching-poor Tampa Bay Devil Rays had won by 10 runs in the series opener on Friday , but yesterday belonged to the Yankees . Even without a victory by starters Kei Igawa and Matt DeSalvo , the Yankees swept the Devil Rays , taking the day game by 7-3 and the night game by 17-5 . Reliever Luis Vizcaino won both . <p> The Yankees ( 50-46 ) shaved a half-game off the Boston Red Sox ' lead in the American League East , reducing it to Kennard , for Jose Molina of the Los Angeles Angels . Wil Nieves will be designated for assignment when Molina arrives . <p> " He can catch and throw extremely well , and he really shuts down the running game , " Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said of Molina , an eight-year veteran . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's been an everyday guy as well . We feel we 've upgraded , and that 's obviously the name of the game . " <p> Hideki Matsui homered in both games of the doubleheader , driving in five runs for the day . He now has eight home runs in his past 16 games . " So far this season , " Matsui said through an interpreter , " the last two or three weeks have been the best that I 've felt . " <p> None of the four starters worked past the fifth inning . Tampa Bay 's Jason Hammel went four innings in the first game and allowed Matsui 's first homer . In the nightcap , the Yankees blitzed J. P. Howell for 7 runs and 10 hits in five innings . <p> That game became a laugher in the sixth against reliever Jay Witasick , best known in Yankee lore for his 54.00 earned run average in the 2001 World Series . Last night , Witasick threw away a bunt and allowed five runs , including the 497th career homer for Alex Rodriguez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sixth inning of the day game also produced five runs for the Yankees , though the hero then was a lot less experienced . It was Shelley Duncan , who ripped his first career homer on his second day in the majors and also acknowledged the fans . <p> Nearly every Yankees hitter had a chance to make an impact over the two games . Rodriguez drove in four runs in the second game , giving him 96 runs batted in for the season . Johnny Damon blooped two doubles and , playing left field , dashed back for a midair catch to save two runs in the second game . <p> Nieves who had one extra-base hit all season before this weekend , had two doubles in the nightcap . But Nieves also lost his job . In Molina , 32 , the Yankees found a veteran who should be much more of an offensive presence than Nieves , the good-fielding , good-natured backup who has hit only .164 . <p> " It 's hard when you think you 've done everything right , but it 's not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disappointing . You do n't want to go through this . But it 's just baseball . This is what happens . " <p> Molina is part of a family of catchers . His brother Bengie catches for the Giants and another brother , Yadier , catches for the Cardinals . Jose , 32 , was batting .224 ( 28 for 125 ) with the Angels and has hit safely in 25 of his 37 starts . <p> Molina hit .240 in a career-high 78 games last season . He has a career average of .238 and has played in 10 postseason games . <p> With the July 31 trading deadline approaching , Cashman will continue to look for upgrades but said he was not optimistic . <p> " We 're open , and we have been , to any idea that makes sense , " he said . " But making sense for two is the problem . That 's a very difficult thing in today 's environment . That 's why things are moving at a glacial speed . But we 'll see . I like the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torre took no chances in the opening victory , using his four most trusted relievers to secure it after Igawa wobbled his way through five innings . <p> Vizcaino came in with the game tied in the sixth , beginning a bullpen relay that also included Kyle Farnsworth , Scott Proctor and Mariano Rivera in a nonsave situation . Farnsworth struck out two as he tried to refine his slider . <p> Farnsworth said the pitching coach , Ron Guidry , told him he has thrown sliders with only 15 percent of his pitches this season . That surprised Farnsworth , who usually throws 30 percent sliders . He said he would change the ratio . <p> " That 's basically my out pitch , " Farnsworth said . " If you 're throwing nothing but fastballs , hitters are going to look for that on every pitch . " <p> Vizcaino ( 8-2 ) is second on the staff in victories , trailing only starter Chien-Ming Wang , who has 10 . Vizcaino 's E.R.A. is 1.03 since May 28 . He leads all major league relievers in victories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubleheader since Lindy McDaniel on May 27 , 1970 . <p> " He 's one of those magic guys this year , " Torre said of Vizcaino . " There 's always someone on a team who falls into some . We 'll call him Magic Man . " <p> Matsui 's Game 1 homer erased a 2-0 lead Tampa Bay had built on homers by B. J. Upton and Ty Wigginton . The Devil Rays had seven hits and three walks in five innings against Igawa , who threw 94 pitches but avoided major damage . <p> " Five innings and 94 pitches is still not good , " Guidry said . " But over all , one of the good things was how he learned a little bit today about how to pitch out of trouble . That 's something he had n't been doing before . " <p> Torre said Igawa would get another start , with Phil Hughes scheduled for two more rehabilitation starts for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Shelley Duncan hit a home run in the first game , his first homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre .
