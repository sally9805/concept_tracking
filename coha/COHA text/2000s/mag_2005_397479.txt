Section : 2006 Investment Guide Stocks &; Bonds Our bullish and bearish stock pickers excelled in 2005 . They look to repeat with Freddie Mac , Syntroleum and 15 more for the year ahead . <p> SINCE THE EARLY 1980S WE 'VE marked the end of the calendar year by asking each of a group of investment pros to name the one stock they think most likely to either outpace or trail the market over the coming 12 months . Our panel of seers now numbers 17 , with 12 bulls , 5 bears . <p> Both sets performed admirably in the year gone by . Long bets from the Love Only One class of 2005 rose an average 16% over the course of the contest versus 7% for the S &P; 500 . The shorts ended a three-year streak of poor showings . Their picks declined 25% on average . In all , 12 of our 17 contestants earned our customary reward for beating the market , an invitation to return for 2006 . Eleven have accepted . <p> The blue ribbon for 2005 's bulls went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank . A year ago he saw a growth play in Cerner , a medical software company . The stock traded for 28 times trailing earnings then . It closed the contest at 41 times a higher earnings number . <p> For 2006 Bateman puts his chips on Mentor , a maker of medical devices ranging from saline breast implants to catheters for urinary incontinence . Bateman finds the product mix well suited to aging baby boomers , among a gaggle of other positives . " Good market share , strong balance sheet , respect in the medical community and good distribution efforts , " he says . <p> The best bear ? Clarion Group 's Morton Cohen took that honor for the second year in a row . In October 2004 he thought Travelzoo looked overpriced and vulnerable to competition in the online travel business . The stock sank 73% . <p> Unfortunately for us , if not for him , Cohen has retired from the investment business . But his former partner , Brian Chait , agreed to stand in . Chait , now proprietor of the BC Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pan of Novavax . The Malvern , Pa. company sells prescription drugs for women 's health and also develops technology to deliver vaccines against infectious disease . <p> Novavax traded below a dollar in August but jumped in price along with avian flu headlines . Chait points to the company 's quarterly losses , its $36 million in long-term debt and stiff competition in the vaccine business . He says that selling by insiders does n't improve the picture . <p> Overseas Shipholding Group is another candidate for decline , says Charles Hanlon , chief strategist with Delta Global Advisors . Hanlon , the bears ' runner-up last year on Annaly Mortgage Management , thinks oil tanker stocks will take a hit from lower energy prices and slowing global economic growth . Shares of Overseas Shipholding , he notes , have held up lately because many of its ships are relatively new . " If the pricing environment becomes even more challenging , " Hanlon warns , " the age of a company 's fleet will mean little . " <p> The bulls ' runner-up was Stephen Auth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year ago he spotted a bargain in McKesson , which jumped 70% during the last 12 months . He returns with Pfizer , whose shares have lost more than half their value since their high in 1999 . Auth argues that the market has both underappreciated Pfizer 's restructuring efforts and overreacted to the potential loss of the company 's Lipitor patent . He also believes Pfizer 's new cholesterol treatment , a blend of Lipitor and torcetrapib , will be a big seller . <p> In the longevity department we bid farewell to bull Richard E. Cripps , Legg Mason 's chief market strategist . Cripps had six years in the contest and narrowly missed a seventh with his pick of Intel . Taking the mantle from him is Joseph Zock , president and portfolio manager at New York value shop Capital Management Associates . <p> Zock , entering his fourth year of Love One action , speculates on a small cap : Syntroleum . The Tulsa company shows latest-12-month revenue of only $7 million , but Zock sees a winner . He especially admires Syntroleum 's technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for combustion engines and fuel cells . <p> Now for the newbies . We welcome Brooke de Boutray of Zevenbergen Capital Investments , a Seattle growth manager with $1.1 billion under management , as a new bull . De Boutray suggests that Aquantive , which earned $31 million on sales of $282 million in the past 12 months , will ride the tailwind of growth in digital advertising . Its Atlas unit , for example , develops software allowing businesses to track which keywords on which search services yield the most new customers . <p> Robert Doll , chief investment officer of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers , oversees 155 funds and $518 billion in assets . He offers Devon Energy , pointing out that 60% of the reserves of this energy exploration company lie in natural gas . Doll also likes its exploration projects in Africa and the Gulf of Mexico , as well as its management . " They 've cleaned up the balance sheet and are credible , " he says . <p> David Goerz , chief investment officer at San Francisco 's HighMark Capital Management , tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he likes the look of RyderSystem . The truck-leasing concern has a thriving supply-management business , he says , and its shares look cheap , relative to the competition . The company is valued at only half its sales . Another plus : Hurricane rebuilding in the Gulf Coast could boost business . <p> Arvind Sachdeva hails from Victory Capital Management , a Cleveland outfit with $56 billion in assets . Sachdeva , who heads up Victory 's activity in intrinsic value investing , goes long with government-sponsored mortgage lender Freddie Mac . He says negative investor sentiment has pushed Freddie 's stock into bargain territory . Sachdeva also expects the shares , now yielding 2.1% , to get a dividend hike . And politics ? " The regulatory cloud should begin to lift as we go into 2006 , " he says . <p> One other bear debuts . Harriet Baldwin is one of six analysts at Palladian Research , a New York equity research boutique . Baldwin 's specialty is industrial stocks ; she cut her teeth in the area as an analyst with Lehman Brothers and Deutsche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printing business and that a tough ad market will hurt RR Donnelley , which prints periodicals , catalogs and financial documents . Class of 2005 : Jolly Good Show <p> Bulls and bears alike fared well in the year gone by . B. Randolph Bateman and Morton Cohen were the aces .
