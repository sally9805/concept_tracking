Prologue Hungry Ghosts As soon as he walked through the wrought-iron gates and out into the pastoral green expanse of Cricklewood Cemetery , Francis X. Loughlin heard the tranquility of a mid-October afternoon being torn open by the crunk and whine of a hard-working backhoe . He looked around , trying to figure out where they were making the hole . Nothing was where it was supposed to be anymore . Another rude metallic thud sent a flock of geese flying high over a mausoleum down by Cypress Pond . He watched the birds disappear from his line of vision a second before he expected them to , another sign of the natural order being disturbed . Twenty years . He took a left at the first granite angel and followed the sound of the machinery up Hemlock Avenue , passing the tree-shaded urn gardens , catafalques , and overground sarcophaguses , the society matrons not far from the stevedores , the nuns near the baseball stars , the Indian Princesses beside the Hat Check Kings , the Natural Causes next to the Sudden Demises . Would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an hour ? Or would the sheer cacophony just be overwhelming ? What happened ? What do you mean , that 's it ? Tony did it ! 911 is a joke . But I wanted so much more ! He shielded his eyes from a gust of flying specks . Would you even be able to hear one soft high girlish voice saying , " Excuse me , but I do n't belong here . " He lumbered on past a Civil War memorial , a bruiser-weight white guy in a three-quarter length leather coat , with boxing glove shoulders , an Etruscan chest , and more or less the gut he deserved at forty-nine . His hairline had retreated up to the grassy hinterlands , revealing a pair of dark rapscallion 's eyebrows over a debauched cherub 's face . Women still liked him , though , because he could listen attentively without interrupting to talk about the Giants and because he seemed like a man who could take broken things and give them back fixed without a lot of pissing and moaning about how hard it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ground had no give to it when they first buried her . There was frost on the headstones , icicles on the crypts , and the trees ' branches were broken blood vessels against a white sky . Maybe after Thanksgiving . A sharp breeze shivered the red maples and sent a wash of dead leaves past his ankles . He felt something catch in his pant cuff and reached down to find a fifty dollar bill stuck there . He picked it up and examined it , seeing it was not just fake but half-burnt . Another gust of wind carried the odd mingled scents of roast duck and smoldering incense . His eyes searched for an explanation , over the stone crosses and up the hill , before they found a Chinese family in black gathered on a rise , traditional candles and flowers arrayed around a casket covered in netting . " Hey , Francis X , que pasa ? " A voice called out from behind him . " Wake up . We 've been waving to you for like two minutes . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , staring at him like a groom who 'd shown up drunk at his own wedding . His eyes adjusted as he recognized most of them as either being from D.A . ' s office or the Medical Examiner 's office . Behind them , the backhoe kept working , digging up a grave by the headstone , Allison Wallis , 1955-1983 . A steel claw reaching into a shallow hole and emerging with a mouthful of dirt . It pivoted and disgorged its load out on to the plywood boards laid out to protect the grass , the smell of topsoil hitting wood setting off a writhing of worms in his gut . " Hey , hey , Scottie , word up . " Francis put on a game face as he went over to greet the video tech , who 'd set up his camera tripod over the trench . " Not the same old same old , eh , Francis ? " said Scott Ferguson , a big bluff guy with a walrus moustache from the Visual Evidence Unit who was always handing out business cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and christenings . " Usually when you put ' em down , they stay down . " v " Absa-fucking-lutely . " Normally he only ran into Scottie at crime scenes , when there was literally still blood on the walls . " So whassup ? " said Scottie . " I tried to ask Paul , but he said this is your clambake . " " Did he now ? " Francis looked across the grave where Paul Raedo , his erstwhile friend , the prosecutor , was having an animated discussion with a lady from the ME 's office , pointing his way every few seconds , trying to reassign the blame no doubt . Four members of the gravediggers ' union stood by in their green uniforms , leaning on picks and shovels , waiting to do the more exacting work of digging around the coffin . " Well , he told me one thing , " Scottie admitted . " He said it 's the fucking weirdest case he ever heard of . " " Do n't believe the hype . " " Well , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Girl 's dead twenty years and her blood shows up on another body last week . " " Sounds like fucking Paul told you plenty . " Francis glared . The backhoe grunted and rocked on its stabilizers as little brown plumes wafted from the gouge , drizzling dust on the people nearby . Francis took some small measure of satisfaction in seeing Paul cough and try to brush the grit off his lapels . " So what 's up with that ? " asked Scottie . " You got the wrong girl buried ? " " That 's what her mother thinks , " said Francis , remembering how he 'd stood on this very spot with Eillen Wallis , a hand on her arm to keep her from jumping in after her daughter . " I 'm trying to keep an open mind . " " And what about the guy you locked up for it ? Paul said he was in the can twenty years . " " He 's not the happiest horse in the race , but what are you gon na do ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The machine kept digging . Each chooff of metal going into soil another little dig to his solar plexus , another reminder that something had gone wrong on his watch . The doctor brings you into the world , the undertaker signs you out , and if something goes wrong in between , the police are supposed to step up . He might have had his lapses , but if you needed someone to get you from crime scene to the grave , he always figured he was the man for the job . Not necessarily to comfort the bereaved the way a priest or a funeral director would - just to keep the game honest . But now he felt like he 'd let down his people . He was supposed to be their representative , their servant , their envoy ; a politician for the Dead . Who else was going to make sure their needs got met ? Who else was going to twist arms , make phone calls , knock on doors , and filibuster on their behalf ? Who else was supposed to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So do I smell a lawsuit in the wind or is somebody burning incense ? " Scottie sniffed . " Chinese funeral up the hill . " Francis pointed with his half-singed dollar to where a bell was softly chiming , joss sticks were fuming and a monk in saffron robes was leading the family in chanting . " They pay people to come or something ? " " Nah . " Francis folded the bill up and stuck it in his breast pocket . " It 's hell money . " " Say what ? " " Hell money . Spending cash for the afterlife . You let the dead go hungry , they might come back and haunt you . " " Maybe you ought to toss it in there instead . " The tech nodded as one of the gravediggers looked down into the pit and gave a thumbs up . " Somebody 's getting an attitude . " " Might be a little late for that already , " said Francis , Slowly the steel claw retracted and the men climbed into the hole with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dirt .
