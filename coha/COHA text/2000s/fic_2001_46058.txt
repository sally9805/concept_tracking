Harvey Jacobs is the author of several witty novels , including Beautiful Soup , American Goliath , and The Juror . He says he 's working on a new one but wo n't say much about it for fear of side effects . He describes this new tale as " a story with porpoise , in tuna with today 's inquiring minds . " <p> BOB AKER KNEW HE WAS behaving like an idiot but when his goldfish , Midas , passed on , he felt a real sense of loss . The fish was the only possession he insisted on keeping when his wife divorced him besides his clothes , laptop , kitchen utensils , culinary appliances and his collection of cookbooks . He did n't care about anything else and gladly signed away his rights to the myriad of objects he suddenly saw as so much junk . He did insist on keeping their Greenwich Village apartment and wrote his ex a huge check for half its value . She wanted to move to the Hamptons anyhow . When the apartment was emptied out by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to huge space . Bob bought a futon , a pillow , some sheets and a blanket and a small bureau for his clothes . He also bought a wicker stand for the goldfish bowl . With what money he had left after his wife cleaned him out , he indulged himself by remodeling the kitchen . Bob 's only hobbies were cooking and eating . Good food gave him inner peace . To nosh was to meditate . One reason for the divorce was the indisputable fact that his gourmet meditations made him fat . His wife , on the other hand , was obsessed with keeping herself lithe and trim . Half the living room , now liberated , once held her exercise machines . Since Bob quit his job as a financial analyst and became an ardent day trader , doing very well in that belly-wrenching profession , he found strength in patience and solace in the kitchen . She had complained about his expanding girth to the point where taking meals together was an abomination . She called him Cholesterol Man . She criticized every spoonful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked his goldfish , accusing Bob of overfeeding lonely Midas who had doubled in size within a few months . The fish had grown lethargic , hardly moved except to forage for its powdery rations . It floated near the bottom of its bowl like a wounded submarine . In an odd sense , Bob saw Midas as a metaphor for the stock market , animated gold , heavy with success , always threatening to implode or explode , teasing oxygen out of water , producing not much more than its own stringy shit , weirdly smug inside its glass shell . Bob meant to put his fish on a diet and even considered shedding a few dozen pounds himself . But watching Midas watch him indulge in one of his feasts , Bob felt pangs of guilt and always went to shake a few more crumbs into the fish bowl . Besides some casual relationships in Bob 's neighborhood , storekeepers and the like , he was virtually without friends or close family . His departed spouse got custody of the people they 'd met as a couple and Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only confidante and he felt obliged to share the pleasures of good eating with his loyal companion . Midas returned Bob 's largesse with fish affection . Bob felt warmth emanating from Midas 's bowl . If Bob put his face close to the glass , Midas would swim toward his nose and confront him face to face . For the moment , that was bonding enough . Midas required no walking , no trips to the vet , no sour-smelling litter box . He was the perfect pet . When Bob found Midas drifting belly up one awful morning , he whispered a prayer and , thinking Egyptian , offered up a few grains of fish food to sustain Midas on the way to eternity . Since his pet was dead , the food drifted past its mouth and settled among the gravel at the bottom of its world . Bob faced facts and though he felt mournful and deserted , reminded of mortality , he quickly scooped up Midas 's golden remains with a ladle and slipped the rigid corpse into an empty horse radish jar . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffin in a plastic bag and took it to Washington Square Park . There he buried his fish near the great Arch , said another farewell , and went to buy a replacement . Bob realized that excessive grief was as unhealthy as enforced loneliness . He liked his solitude but hated eating alone . The tiny presence of a goldfish made an enormous difference in his sparse domestic environment . While Bob had qualms about finding a substitute for Midas so quickly , he decided to suspend lament and cater to his own urgent need to fill the deserted bowl with something alive and moderately responsive . Bob walked briskly along West 4th Street , then turned south on the Avenue of the Americas to Bleeker Street . His destination was a few buildings in from the corner , an old tenement that once housed a pizza parlor on the ground floor and Berman 's Petropolis a flight upstairs . Bob anticipated a slice of hot pizza thick with cheese and mushrooms to ease his bereavement , but when he found the building he saw that the pizza joint was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white crosses painted across their windows . Like so many buildings in the Village , this one was slated for demolition and gentrification . Petropolis 's large front window was covered with sheet metal , plastered with posters for movies and off-off-Broadway shows . To Bob 's surprise , the pet store was still doing business according to a cardboard sign tacked to the wooden door that read : BERMAN 'S PETROPOLIS FINAL SALE .. 40% OFF ! HURRY ! ( ONE FLIGHT UP TO BIG BAR . GAINS ) Bob let out a long sigh . Everything was in flux . Nothing stayed in place for very long anymore . Nothing and nobody . He climbed the ancient staircase and knocked at Petropolis 's entrance . From previous dealings with Berman - he 'd bought Midas there and went back twice a year for Midas 's provisions - he knew the little man was obviously paranoid . Berman 's metal door was kept locked and bolted . PROTECTED BY labels warned off thieves and thugs . A large black alarm box was riveted to the ceiling above the barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corroded wire as it had for years . Knocking was the only way to catch Berman 's nervous attention . Eventually he would shuffle across his loft , peer through a peephole , trip locks , slide bolts and turn the knob . This time it took five knockings to rouse Berman , who finally appeared , shaking off webs from a nap , rubbing red eyes , coughing and yawning . " You ? Long time no see , " German said . " Do n't stand there . That 's exactly what muggers like . They sneak up behind you and bash in your brains . For what ? A few lousy bucks ? The only thing cheap these days is life . And what I got on sale . " Bob hurried inside while Berman secured the premises . He breathed in the familiar smell of Berman 's menagerie , a hot , musky mix of fur , feathers , scales , drippings and droppings . Actually , the smell was n't unpleasant . Not Chanel #5 , but not terrible - bearable , organic , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kittens , monkeys to puppies , gerbils to turtles , lizards to snakes fused into a turgid wind that carried memories of chirping , growling , mewing , bubbling . " I did n't recognize you . You put on a few tons , heh ? " Berman said . " How 's your fish ? " " Dead , - Bob said . " They do that , " Berman said . " Sorry . How 's your missus ? " " Forget about her . " " Again , sorry . My condolences . " With the front window sealed , the only light came from a few fluorescent wands . Bob looked around through the eerie glow and saw that Petropolis was largely depleted of its usual population . The creatures that were left looked limp and mangy like old produce in a fruit market . There were many empty cages hanging from the ceiling and naked shelves behind vacant counters . Obviously Berman had his walking papers from a greedy landlord . Petropolis was in its sad last hours . Still , there were enough goldfish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic tropicals . Bob considered upgrading to Siamese or Angels but remembered that fancy fishes needed filters , pumps , heaters , plants , elaborate tanks , special foods . He knew from experience that their life span was inversely proportionate to their beauty . No , he 'd stick with a good old dependable goldfish that could take New York tap water in stride . " I see you 're closing shop , " Bob said . " It 's not hard to see . Why else is everything in the store forty percent off ? Because I went crazy ? They 're kicking me out , the bastards . And there 's no place to go . So I got to get rid of the whole works . They 're pushing me out on the sidewalk . I got a court order . I can stay three months . But already they try to intimidate me . They disconnect my electric . They cut off my pipes . I got to shlep water from the Greek luncheonette . They ripped out my telephone lines . Hooray for the millennium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Berman , " Bob said . " I always enjoy coming up here . " " That 's how it goes , " Berman said . " How can I help you ? You want a dozen white mice ? Name it . What ? Everything is a steal . " " I want another goldfish . A healthy one . Not too fat . " " That 's it ? A goldfish ? Why not take them all ? " " One is plenty . " " A few boxes of food ? For what it cost me . " " I have enough left over . " " I like a big spender , " Berman said . " Go over and pick a goldfish . I 'll pull it out for you . " Bob went to the fish wall and browsed the goldfish tank . His choice was easy . One fish among the swirl looked like an especially hearty specimen . It had good color , good spirit , good prospects . " That one . " " Just a minute . I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jar ? I hate carrying around a fish in a bag of water . " " One goldfish forty percent off and you want a jar ? How about a champagne bottle ? Maybe gift wrapping ? " Berman headed for the back of the store . Bob wandered around exploring Petropolis 's remaining inhabitants . He wondered what would become of Berman 's sorry leftovers . There were always bottom fishers who snapped up anything cheap enough . And women who could n't resist a runt of the litter . Berman would probably find customers for most of the pets . Maybe some store would buy the rest of the miserable collection . He poked his finger at a cat sitting on some newspapers in a wire mesh cage . It was n't a kitten , it was n't full grown . " Definitely a hard sell , " Bob said , " but you might get lucky . " The cat rolled over and let Bob scratch its belly . Bob continued his browsing , feeling more and more depressed . He was impatient to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and either fix himself a snack , maybe an avocado stuffed with tuna , or go over to the White Horse Tavern for a cheeseburger and a beer . He caught a look at himself ina wall mirror behind a budgie cage looking pasty and pale in that thin synthetic flicker . Bob watched the one last bird , a faded blue looser with a bent beak , flap riddled wings that reminded him of World War I fighter planes after a tough skirmish . " Mr. Berman ? " he yelled . " I have a busy day . Could we finish our business please ? I do n't mean to rush you , but .... " Bob got no answer . He figured that Berman was taking a piss or finishing off a sandwich . Who could tell with that sullen man ? He was probably half senile , he might have forgotten the whole transaction . Bob navigated past tables , boxes , and vacant cases following Berman 's path to wherever it was he kept his supplies and probably a Mosler Safe with six combination locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his store . He must have gotten himself a bed and a hot plate and holed up there for half a century . " Berman ? Can you hear me ? I ca n't just hang around . " Bob turned an unexpected corner , went down a corridor , and found Berman 's secret nest . His suspicions were correct . There was a desk , a safe , a hot plate , a cabinet stuffed with clothes and a cot with a rusty frame . Berman was lying on the floor holding a calculator . Water spilled from a Petropolis carry bag made a puddle near Berman 's head . Bob knew immediately that Berman was dead . He felt for a pulse and tried CPR but it was no use . No more Midas , no more Berman . A very bad day . Bob found a telephone on Berman 's desk under a pile of catalogs . All it could get was a dismal buzz . He remembered what Berman said about the landlord 's campaign to evict him . Bob could have kicked himself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without it . But coping with his dead fish upset even entrenched habits . Bob took time to cover Berman 's body with a blanket , then went to get help . He got as far as the defended outer door . The locks and bolts were secure . He went back to find Berman 's keys , riffling through a multitude of pockets in his pants , vest , and shirt , but found nothing but a wallet and a Swiss Army knife . Bob felt the clutch of understandable anxiety . " God knows where this nut case hides his keys , " Bob said to Berman 's corpse . " You got me locked in this pig sty . No phone . No water . Sometimes no electric . " What about customers ? Did Berman have any customers left ? After an hour of banging against the metal plates that closed off Petropolis 's front window , after screaming for attention at what seemed like air vents , after looking for some possible exit from his curious predicament , Bob accepted that he had a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs and knock knock knock . But when ? Worst case , no customers would come calling and Berman still had three months to clear out . Three months ? Alone with a dead body and a bunch of comatose creatures dreaming of life in a fantasy forest long since leveled by chain saws . They must have quit hoping for loving masters and happy homes when they picked up Berman 's negative vibrations . Animals and birds know about things . They have their ways . " The good news is that nothing up here is big enough to eat me , " Bob said to a garden snake . " No lions or tigers . No pit bulls roaming around . " The thought reminded Bob of his own appetite . He had n't even had breakfast . Bob quit his search for Berman 's key chain and went foraging for food . He found sacks of litter , a few cans of cat food , a box of Purina Dog Chow , a jar marked BLOOD WORMS , and one bag that held a single serving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a tea bag . At least there was water in the fish tanks . Not Evian but potable . Bob sat on the floor eating the dry corn flakes , considering his situation . Except for split-second decisions about the swing of the market , Bob had a way of taking forever to make his moves . He grinned thinking about his wife 's ballooning rage when he lingered over the tomato bin at the market , choosing his tomatoes like a diamond merchant picking gems . And here he was , facing up to his problems , weighing his options like he weighed a bunch of seedless grapes . The lights flared and went out . Bob was sealed in a black cube . Berman said the landlord was taunting him by playing mind games with the electric . Either that or the bill was ten years past due . Listening to Berman was like listening to Alan Greenspan talk about no inflation . Fact and fiction fused to affliction . Even though he 'd quit smoking after his divorce , largely to spite his wife by adding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunhill lighter he 'd bought when puts and calls on e-Trade made him $32,000 in three hours . It was his talisman , his charm , a reminder of his worth . Bob reached for the lighter and flicked it on . The flame burned bright . He stood up and headed back to Berman 's quarters . There had to be candles someplace . If the plug had been pulled , Berman must have prepared for future blackouts . Sure enough , a box of votive candles waited for emergencies on top of the safe . Soon Petropolis was illuminated with comforting beams , though the candles threw ominous shadows . Bob fell asleep on Berman 's cot . He was wakened when the fluorescents came back on . Berman had been telling the truth , the landlord was a gamesman . Bob rushed around extinguishing the candles , blowing into each glass of waxy hot soup . By then he was ravenous . " There is no other solution , " Bob thought to himself . " None but to endure this indignity with as much grace as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatherer . " He went back into the body of the store and addressed his fellow captives . " I have nothing against any of you , " he said . " Like you , I 'm a prisoner against my will . It is n't my fault that fate formed my atoms into a Homo sapiens instead of a frog . Luck of the draw . And like you I must eat . But there is nothing else to eat but you guys . I will not swallow cat food or worms . Oh , I hear you . No , devouring Mr. Berman is out of the question . I believe in lines of no crossing . This is n't the Donner Pass . I am no Jeffrey Dahmer . So do n't even think it . You 're all doomed anyhow . At least this way you can know that your protein-rich carcasses will be used to good purpose . " I respect you all . My fish gave me solace during very hard times . I am not a malicious man . But you are potentially nutritious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all agree to make the best of things . Whatever he is , Bob Aker is a helluva chef . He 'll bring out your best . And that 's a kind of immortality . " Bob 's inspired oration was met with various sounds of approval . He bowed , laughing to himself to prove he was n't getting as crazy as Berman . It was time for making choices . Bob went to the bank of fish tanks and peered into liquid domains . The fish he 'd selected to buy was the only one with real substance . But that was to be Midas 's heir . He was n't going to broil it unless all else failed . To die in one of Berman 's dirty pans without wine , butter and lemon for an epitaph was unthinkable . Still , the others , taken together , would only make a few mouthfuls . Bob had an epiphany . He cupped his hands and succeeded in isolating his chosen goldfish , lifted it gently from its habitat , and placed it in an otherwise empty tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank . Guppies to tetras , the exotics were mixed with the generic golds . Then Bob stepped back and let nature take its course . His vision was clear . The fish would work things out among themselves . They would swallow one another until only one fish remained triumphant . It would be like those epic wars on cable television . A single survivor would emerge , bloated in victory . A fish that would be chubby enough to make a decent meal was worth the waiting . Appetite increases with anticipation . As a respected gourmet , Bob knew very well that anticipation is the ultimate secret ingredient , the best spice of all . For twenty hours , Bob watched an incredible show . There were no station breaks , no interruptions . The plot was basic enough , without complications or subtleties . There was suspense , horror , even a little humor and beauty . Underwater enemies , some born to kill , others forced to carnage , twisted , dived , hid behind plants that waved in the roiled water , darted suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs came when one fish would indulge in a moment of satisfaction after chewing up a fin or tail . In that time of contentment , another fish would sense an advantage and inflict terrible punishment . Some fish bled red , others just dissolved into death . Bob was hypnotized by the spectacle and never noticed time passing . At long last only one fish was left . Ironically , it was one of the goldfish that had hugged the tank 's glass wall and inherited bits and pieces of former associates as they drifted by its welcoming face . Its first and last joust was with another goldfish surprised when its passive kin turned to a furious cannibal . From attending countless buffet dinners , Bob knew about feeding frenzies . Before taking the next step , Bob went to empty his bladder . But where was Berman 's facility and what good was a toilet without water to flush ? Behind the office , Bob found what passed for a bathroom . A cactus plant rested on the closed toilet seat . Ingenious Berman had built himself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned it out just before Bob came to Petropolis . It looked like a sandbox . Bob had a giddy feeling using it ; whirlwinds of memory brought him back to defunct playgrounds where apartment houses now stood . He zipped up and went back into the store . Bob lifted the winning gladiator goldfish out of the wet coliseum and saw its raw mouth open and close , gasping a series of why mets . It was a pity that goldfish would n't translate into sushi . It had to be changed by fire to be marginally edible . Without butter for the pan Bob accepted that his dinner would shrivel to the size of a sardine . He had another sensible thought . He wished his wife could see his mind work . He put dinner on hold , took the expiring fish and dropped it into the cage where the white mice lived . This time he did n't wait around for the mouse feast . He found an old newspaper and read an article about the plot to get rid of Princess Diana . Was a tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorically and Bob found himself wondering , is every accident a conspiracy ? Berman would say sure , probably . Bob dozed again and dreamed about time . Was it night or day ? His watch gave him the hour and minute but no more information . He woke without a clue to the answer . There was no way to tell . What he did know was that he was hot and thirsty . He went to the fish tank where battle had been done , made a face , took a breath , then dipped his head into rusty brownish water that had to contain some nutrients . It did n't taste all that bad . Then he went to check on the mice . Sure enough , the goldfish was history and the mice fatter and more playful . Bob thought about boiling up the batch of rodents , a revolting prospect . And , like the fish , even twelve mice would be the equivalent of an hors d'oeuvre . He needed a main course , not an appetizer . Bob wrapped the Diana newspaper around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch the last snake in Petropolis . The garter gave him no trouble ; it hung like a spent rubberband . But when he dropped his serpent in with the mice , the snake came alert , began to coil and uncoil , slithered around , then grabbed a mouse by a hind leg . Bob waited until the reptile jaws expanded into a version of the Paris tunnel that folded around the dark-starred princess and sucked in the struggling squeaker . It was not a pleasant sight or a quick death . But Bob could see the snake fatten with prey and calculated that , when all the mice were ingested and digested , he 'd have sixteen inches in length , a half-inch in diameter of prime snake meat that could easily be grilled right on the hot plate 's coils . That is , if the electricity held out . If not , he could finish up the job using candles . While the snake went about its serious business , Bob did some exercises . He stretched his arms and circled them , he did knee bends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropping down , he thought about his wife and who might be exercising on the mat of her muscular body at that very moment . He found himself fighting back tears . When his depression passed , Bob pulled himself off the wooden floor and did his best to feed the few citizens of Petropolis . After a few days , Bob had second thoughts about fattening his snake . It was taking forever . But when he checked he saw fewer and fewer white mice until there were none . And his snake had swelled magnificently . It was as corpulent as a sausage . He fired up the hot plate , readied a paper plate , filled a cardboard coffee cup with another draught from the fish tank , put on his makeshift gloves . This time the snake that had hung like a strand of overdone spaghetti was full of piss and vinegar , hissing and biting on its way to Berman 's table . Bob took Berman 's Swiss Army knife and clipped off the snake 's ugly head . He chopped the snake into inch-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Texas cowboy stewing a rattler . Bob was ready for a hearty feed . He gazed at the diced snake steaks and shook his head . Mice or no mice , there was n't enough meat to fill a fashion model so why kid himself ? Why live in denial ? Bob took his disappointment in stride . He fed part of the snake to the gerbils , a bit of poetic justice considering their rodent ancestry , tossed a few shards to the turtles and served a choice few inches to the spavined kitty/cat that had long since finished the last of the stinking cat food . The feline gobbled its ration and looked up at Bob , mewing a sorrowful plea for more . Bob went to the budgie cage . He had no fruit , lettuce or seeds for the bird which was already beyond fight or flight , so he did the merciful thing and gave it to the furball whose cries grew stronger at the prospect of a feathered dessert . Bob played with the purring pussycat , rounded up the turtles and boiled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had when he was a kid . It had MIAMI BEACH painted on its back . What was his turtle 's fate ? He came home from school one day and it was gone . His mother said it must have been kidnapped and soothed Bob 's misery with a batch of fresh muffins , yes , corn muffins plump and springy . The turtle soup , even with floating bits of meat , was n't the meal he was waiting for . Bob let the brew cool then gave it to the gerbils . Instead of drinking , they spilled the broth onto the floor . Bob saw a roach dash out from behind a counter and head for the warm pool . He stomped the roach and fed it to a salamander , then fed salamander parts to some Easter chicks he discovered in a homemade incubator . Those chicks had definite possibilities . But they were hardly hatched . There was no satisfaction there . Bob knew himself well enough to measure the cavern of his hunger . A nibble of chicken and a few soft bones would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling weak . He moved a flattened pillow to the Petropolis door and camped there , praying for a knock . No wonder Berman died when he did . Business was nonexistent . Bob could hear car horns and truck motors from the street . He knew that hundreds of people must be hurrying past the building . Not one of them was in the market for a really good deal on a loving companion . Bob thought about those people , involved , focused , probably headed home carrying bags of succulents from Balducci 's or maybe the Jefferson or the A &P.; They could be aimed for any one of a hundred restaurants in the area . He dwelt on those thoughts but his own mouth was too dry to salivate . He drifted in and out of sleep , mocked by twilight dreams of a Lasagna Wife or a Rack of Lamb Mistress . Sex with those amalgams took place on beds of mashed or home-fried potatoes . His orgasms produced wan spurts of gravy . Bob knew he had to keep in motion while he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lifeboats bobbing around in undrinkable seas or buried under tons of earth . They 'd be found alive and reasonably well after all hope was abandoned . Always those blessed ones had stories about how they kept their spirits up by using false hope as a paddle to thwart the reaper . Compared to them , Bob was in the catbird seat . He had a food supply and reserves of body fat to get him to the day when some construction workers would come to convert Petropolis into a 4-room condo . Bob dragged himself to the box where he 'd stashed the chirpy chicks . They were still minuscule , not yet a match for a multi-vitamin pill . He worked up enough energy to twist their cute necks and feed them to the gerbils . Those gerbils were doing fine . They were the size of piglets . Seeing them finish off the chicks , Bob could taste paradise . He snapped open Berman 's Swiss Army knife and tested the blade . Bob thrust the blade into one of the gerbil bodies . The gamble paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its needle teeth buzzed greedily through its roommate 's glossy pelt . While the gerbil chomped at a tiny wish bone , Bob went to see how his new goldfish was doing . It was doing fine , as happy as Midas had been . Bob shook some minced worms into the tank and gave it a knowing wink . Bob felt sorry about the pussy but he 'd made up his mind that the gerbil would cook more to his standards . Even a starving mewer would be worth a few more ounces of tender gerbil gut . A merger was definitely in order . Yawning , a bit woozy , he went to dispatch the expendable kitten/ cat and was amazed to see it had transformed to a full blown cat . It was n't cute anymore . That made things easier . But what happened to time ? " How long have I been stuck in here ? " Bob yelled to the dead Berman who lay molding , polluting the otherwise breathable Petropolis 's air . " When that gerbil is done , crusty and juicy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to share with you , Berman . My former wife often accused me of being a human garbage disposal , and this time she 'd be absolutely correct . That gerbil is mine nose to balls , so do n't ask for a place at the table . I 'm the one destined to bear witness . " Bob opened the cat cage . He closed his fingers around the Swiss Army knife while he gave the cat a few strokes . " Nice parting gifts , " Bob said . " Like on Wheel of Fortune . " He jabbed with the knife but the cat nipped at his hand , then leapt through the opening . It landed on the floor with a soft thud and disappeared in the murk . " Here baby , baby , " Bob cooed . " Here pretty pussy . Come back to Uncle Bob . Hurry up . It 's time . " Bob searched for the cat without finding a trace . Sooner or later the cat would emerge looking for some digestible affection . Bob was famous for patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found the tank empty . " So be it , " Bob said . " Let 's be a grownup about this . Cat eats fish . Gerbil gets that much more cat to digest . Bob eats more gerbil . It 's the way of things . " Bob improvised a dance . He was dancing when the electricity quit again . He took his Dunhill and lit a few candle stubs . Bob went to visit the tender , round gerbil . " Hang in there , " he said . " Dinner is practically on the table . The bad news is , the Supreme Court denied your appeal . The good news is that fucking cat will be your last supper . " The lights came back on after a few hours . Bob went to the office , held his nose , frowned at Berman , and clicked on the hot plate 's switch . Its coils glowed like cartoon eyes . " Here , cat , " Bob yelled , " Mr. Gerbil is famished . I can use a few calories myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I promise you a better world , a place where cats are emperors . It beats scrounging for goldfish . All right , then . Let 's consider a deal . How 'd you like a gerbil sandwich ? Sound good ? It could be arranged . I 'm flexible . Cat ? " A month later Petropolis 's landlord had Berman 's door smashed open . What he found gave the city its daily jolt . There were the scraps of two human bodies scattered among assorted rubble . One was the former proprietor , Mr. Berman . The second could not be identified . It was presumed that Berman died resisting a robbery , but not before he got his revenge on the intruder . The only thing moving was the biggest cat the landlord , or the cops he called , ever saw . A cat the size of a Doberman . It was standing on a bone pile playing with a set of keys . The story made the six o'clock news . The landlord told a reporter , " It 's my kind of cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synchronicity . Call it love . Call it what you want . One thing sure , I 'll make sure it gets a good home and that 's a solemn promise . If any of your viewers out there are interested in adoption ..... " Bob 's ex-wife saw the broadcast . She smiled at the landlord 's unusual display of compassion . " People like that make me proud , " she said to her lover , a man who weighed less than half of what was left of Bob Aker 's shrunken behind . " You know what ? I think I just might call the station . "
