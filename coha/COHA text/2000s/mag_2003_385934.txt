Reclaiming the Sabbath <p> RECENTLY , at a used bookstore , I came across Nan Fink 's memoir Stranger in the Midst , the story of her conversion to Judaism . She describes the preparations she and her soon-to-be-husband made for Shabbat : <p> On Friday afternoon , at the very last minute , we 'd rush home , stopping at the grocery to pick up supplies . Flying into the kitchen we 'd cook ahead for the next twenty-four hours . Soup and salad , baked chicken , yams and applesauce for dinner , and vegetable cholent or lasagna for the next day 's lunch . Sometimes I 'd think how strange it was to be in such a frenzy to get ready for a day of rest . <p> Shabbat preparations had their own rhythm , and once the table was set and the house straightened , the pace began to slow . " It 's your turn first in the shower , " I 'd call to Michael . " Okay , but it 's most getting late , " he 'd answer , concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd linger at the mirror , examining myself , stroking the little lines on my face , taking as much time as I could to settle into a mood of quietness . When I joined Michael and his son for the lighting of the candles , the whole house seemed transformed . Papers and books were neatly piled , flowers stood in a vase on the table , and the golden light of the setting sun filled the room ... <p> Shabbat is like nothing else . Time as we know it does not exist for these twenty-four hours , and the worries of the week soon fall away . A feeling of joy appears . The smallest object , a leaf or a spoon , shimmers in a soft light , and the heart opens . Shabbat is a meditation of unbelievable beauty . <p> I was sitting with a cup of hot chai in a red velvet chair at the Mudhouse , a coffee shop in Charlottesville , when I read that passage . It was a Sunday afternoon . I had attended church in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pigs with my friend 's two-year-old twins , and eventually wended my way down to the Mudhouse for chai and a half hour with a good book . It was not an ordinary workday , and I did feel somewhat more relaxed than I would on Monday morning . But it was not Shabbat . Nan Fink nailed it : Shabbat is like nothing else . And Shabbat is , without question , the piece of Judaism I miss the most . <p> It is also the piece I should most easily be able to keep . A yearning to , say , observe the Jewish New-Year , or a desire to hear the Torah chanted in Hebrew : those things might be harder to incorporate into a Christian life . But the Sabbath ! The Sabbath is a basic unit of Christian time , a day the church , too , tries to devote to reverence of God and rest from toil . And yet a Sunday afternoon finds me sitting in a coffee shop , spending money , scribbling in the margins of my book , very much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sure that I have opened my heart in any particular way . <p> God first commands the Sabbath to the Jewish people in Exodus , with the initial revelation of the Ten Commandments , and then again in Deuteronomy . The two iterations are similar , though not identical . In Exodus God says , " Remember the bath day and keep it holy , " whereas in Deuteronomy God enjoins us to " observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy . " where in the Hebrew Bible , God elaborates upon this simple instruction , noting in Exodus 35 , for example , that no fire should be kindled on Shabbat , and in Isaiah 66 that on the Sabbath , the faithful should " come to worship before me . " <p> There are , in Judaism , two types of commandments ( mitzvot ) : the mitzvot asei , or the " Thou shalts , " and the mitzvot lo ta'aseh , or the " Thou shalt nots . " Sabbath observance comprises both . You are commanded , principally , to be joyful and restful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymns , dress in your finest . Married couples even get rabbinical brownie points for having sex on the Sabbath . <p> And there are , of course , the mitzvot lo ta'aseh . The cornerstone of Jewish Sabbath observance is the prohibition of work in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 : " You shall not do any work , you or your son or your daughter , your male or female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you . " Over time , the rabbis teased out of the text just what the prohibition on work meant , first identifying 39 categories of activities to be avoided on Shabbat , and then fleshing out the implications of those 39 ( if one is not to light afire , for example , one also ought not handle matches or kindling ) . <p> It 's easy to look at the Jewish Sabbath as a long list of thou shalt nots : Do n't turn on lights ; do n't drive ; do n't cook ; do n't carry a pair of scissors anywhere at all ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and cutting is also forbidden on Shabbat ) ; it 's OK to carry a stone or a sweater or a scarf , but only inside your own house , not out onto the street and then into the house of another ; do n't plan for the week ahead ; do n't write a sonnet or a sestina or a haiku ; do n't even copy down a recipe ; and while you are allowed to sing , you should n't play a musical instrument , and of course you must n't turn on a radio or a record player . <p> What all this boils down to ( and boiling is another thing you can not do on Shabbat ) is , do not create . Do not create a casserole or a Valentine card or a symphony or a pot of coffee . Do not create anything at all , for one of the things the Sabbath reprises is God 's rest after he finished creating . <p> ONE OF THE FINEST explanations I know of the Orthodox Sabbath comes from Lis Harris 's Holy Days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heights , New York . Harris , a secular Jew , has come to Crown Heights to spend Shabbat with the Konigsbergs . She is perplexed , and a little annoyed , by all the restrictions . Over dinner , she asks her hosts why God cares whether or not she microwaves a frozen dinner on Friday night . <p> " What happens when we stop working and controlling nature ? " Moishe Konigsberg responds . " When we do n't operate machines , or pick flowers , or pluck fish from the sea ? ... When we cease interfering in the world we are acknowledging that it is God 's world . " <p> I remember , from my Jewish days , the language we used to name the Sabbath . We spoke of the day as Shabbat haMalka , the Sabbath Queen , and we sang hymns of praise on Friday night that welcomed the Sabbath as a bride . It is something of this reverence , and this celebration , that is missing from my Sabbaths now . <p> I remember the end of Shabbat , Saturday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you is eager to hop into your car and race to a movie , go out dancing , sip a late-night espresso . But still , even after a full day of Shabbat rest and even Shabbat toe-tapping boredom ( because , let 's face it , occasionally dull ) , even then you are sad to see Shabbat the end of Shabbat with a ceremony call which comes from the Hebrew verb meaning " to separate , " in this case separating Shabbat from the week . Havdalah involves a number of ritual objects  --  wine for tasting a braided candle for lighting , and a box of fragrant spices ( cloves , often , and cinnamon ) , and you pass around the spice box because smelling the sweet spices comforts you a little , you who are sad that Shabbat has ended . One of the reasons you are sad is this : Judaism speaks of a neshamah yeteirah , an extra soul that comes to dwell in you on the Sabbath but departs once the week begins . <p> I remember that , for Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the entire week points , toward Shabbat . The rabbis , who are always interested in the subtleties of Torah prose , puzzled over the two different versions of the Sabbath commandment . Why , in Exodus , does God tell us to remember the Sabbath , whereas in Deuteronomy he instructs observance of the Sabbath ? <p> One story the rabbis tell about the difference between remembrance and observance has to do with ordering time . Sunday , Monday and Tuesday are caught up in remembering the preceding Shabbat , while Wednesday through Friday are devoted to preparing for the next Shabbat . <p> What , really , was wrong with my Mudhouse Sabbath ? After all , I did spend Sunday morning in church . And I was n't working that afternoon , not exactly . A fine few hours , except that my Sunday was more an afternoon off than a Sabbath . It was an add-on to a busy week , not the fundamental unit around which I organized my life . The Hebrew word for holy means , literally , " set apart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I had violated a most basic command : to keep the Sabbath holy . <p> I am not suggesting that Christians embrace the strict regulations of the Orthodox Jewish Sabbath . Indeed , the New Testament unambiguously inaugurates a new understanding of Shabbat . In his epistles , Paul makes clear that the Sabbath , like other external signs of piety , is insufficient for salvation . As he writes in his Letter to the Colossians , " Therefore do not let anyone judge you . .. with regard to a religious festival , a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day . These are a shadow of the things that were to come ; the reality , however , is found in Christ . " And Jesus , when rebuked by the Pharisees for plucking grain from a field on Shabbat , criticizes those who would make a fetish of Sabbath observance , insisting that " the Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath . " <p> But there is something in the Jewish Sabbath that is absent from most Christian Sundays : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time wholly set apart , and , perhaps above all , a sense that the point of Shabbat , the orientation of Shabbat , is toward God . <p> Pick up any glossy women 's magazine from the last few years and you 'll see what I mean . The Sabbath has come back into fashion , even among the most secular Americans , but the Sabbath we now embrace is a curious one . Articles abound extolling the virtues of treating yourself to a day of rest , a relaxing and leisurely visit to the spa , an extra-long bubble bath , and a glass of Chardonnay . Take a day off , the magazines urge their harried readers . Rest . <p> There might be something to celebrate in this revival of Sabbath , but it seems to me that there are at least two flaws in the reasoning . First is what we might call capitalism 's justification for Sabbath rest : resting one day a week makes you more productive during the other six . Or , as my father has often told me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 . And while that may be true , rest for the sake of future productivity is at odds with the spirit of Shabbat . <p> We could call the second problem with the current Sabbath vogue the fallacy of the direct object . Whom is the contemporary Sabbath designed to honor ? Whom does it benefit ? Why , the bubble-bath-taker herself , of course ! The Bible suggests something different . In observing the Sabbath , one is both giving a gift to God and imitating God . Exodus and Deuteronomy make this clear when they say , " Six days shall you labor and do all your work . But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God . " To the Lord your God . <p> CHRISTIANITY HAS a long tradition of Sabbath observance , so a revitalized Sabbath is more a reclaiming of the Christian birthright than the self-conscious adoption of something Jewish . Jesus observed Shabbat , even as he challenged the specifics of Mosaic Sabbath law ; and since at least the year 321 , when Constantine declared Sunday as Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a day for rest , communal worship and celebration . New England Puritans summed up their thoughts about Sunday thus : " Good Sabbaths make good Christians . " <p> For Christians , the Sabbath has an added dimension : it commemorates not only God 's resting from creation , but also God 's resurrection . As 18-century Pietist Johann Friedrich Starck put it , " Under the New Testament , Christians also consecrate one day out of seven , Sunday , to God , that being the day on which Christ rose from the dead , and the Holy Spirit was poured out . " ( Starck encouraged readers even to begin their Sabbath practices on Saturday evening , urging the Christian to " disentangle his mind from worldly cares and troubles ... Prepare himself for the coming Sunday with prayer , ... and retire to rest betimes , " so as to be punctual and sprightly at church the next morning . ) <p> As for me , I am starting small . I have joined a Bible study that meets Sundays at five , a bookend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not enough time between church and Bible study to pull out my laptop and start working , so instead I try to have a leisurely lunch with friends from church . I have forsworn Sunday shopping ( a bigger sacrifice than you may realize ) , and I sometimes join my friend Ginger on her afternoon visits to church shut-ins . Sometimes before Bible study , you will find me with the twins and the can-do pigs , and sometimes you will still find me at the Mudhouse . Not much , when compared to the dramatic cessations of the Orthodox Shabbat ; but still , the first arcs of a return to Sabbath . <p> By Lauren F. Winner <p> <p> Lauren F.
