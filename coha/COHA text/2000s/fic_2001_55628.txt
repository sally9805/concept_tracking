On freezing winter nights , the boys had two chores before going to sleep . They had to tie the blankets down to the bed frames so that they would not toss their covers off in their dreams and get frostbite on their hands and feet . And they had to empty their chamber pot so that what was in it would not freeze and need thawing on the stove in the morning . <p> One night they remembered to tic down the blankets but forgot to empty the pot . When they were all settled in , someone remembered the pot , but it was so cold that night that no one would get out of bed to take it out . Storm windows had already been put on so they could not even cheat by emptying it out the window . <p> They argued for a while about whose turn it was to empty the pot and then argued about who would have to thaw it out in the morning if nobody emptied it that night . <p> If we keep arguing like this , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said one boy . <p> At least arguing is making it nice and warm under the covers , said another . <p> That gave the youngest boy an idea . Let 's keep the pot under the blankets with us tonight  --  then it wo n't freeze , he said . <p> It will have to be in your bed , said the oldest boy . <p> All right , said the youngest , if you will be the one who gets out of bed to get it . <p> The oldest boy jumped out of bed and ran across the cold linoleum floor to get it . <p> The youngest boy had to loosen his blankets a little bit to get the pot in with him . He put it right under his feet so that he would not trip on it . At first , the metal pot felt cold , but soon it warmed up with him and seemed to keep his feet warm . He told the other boys about this , and within a few nights all the boys were willing to take their turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even thought over who could have it in his bed-but not so much that they spilled any of it . <p> <p> By Jim Heynen <p>
