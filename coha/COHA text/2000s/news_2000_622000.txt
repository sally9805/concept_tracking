<p> NEW THREATS TO THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY <p> Editor  --  Thank you for your strong and to-the-point editorial , " Defending Your Privacy . . . , " ( April 10 ) . It is sad that the homily " the business of America is business " is taken so seriously that in this , of all lands , the citizen is obliged to wage an often-uphill battle to assert the privacy of his address , phone number , Social Security number , and other financial and personal data ( including those which Web sites harvest ) . <p> How hard it is to instill the precept , which is lodged in common sense and in common civilities and respect , that when a person discloses his particulars in connection with a specific transaction , that information is being provided only for that particular transaction , and only for the purposes which the client may elect to initiate or maintain with a business or institution . <p> A law which places the well-being of society over the ease and prosperity of businesses should make it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for what purpose or purposes to divulge information about himself or herself . And although the information in public records are public , there also should be laws whereby " me-too , here-I-am , come-let's-go-for-a-ride " businesses are prohibited from pouncing on such information the instant they get into public records . <p> In AB 1707 , SB 1372 , or SB 1337 , California legislators have the opportunity to choose between pandering to the voracity of predatory entrepreneurs or voting to uphold the dignity of each citizen , his right to privacy , and his prerogative to decide whom to invite into his personal domain . <p> JACK ASLANIAN , M.D. <p> Oakland <p> FREEDOM FOR ELIAN <p> Editor  --  Wars and politics have split up and separated many families . It happened in World War II , Iran , Vietnam , Cuba and many more countries around the world . Unless you have lived and experienced these problems , you have no clues of the reality . Elian is not a parental custody case . It is one of granting the young man a life of freedom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba . Elian 's father could be granted a permanent visa to visit his son , but taking his son 's freedom away is a very high price to pay . <p> Most of the immigrants and refugees parted with their families and fled to America for freedom and opportunity . Many parents around the world would give everything they have to send their sons and daughters to America for a better life . It will be a sad day for Elian , his family and America if he is returned to Cuba . <p> GUNTIS OSITIS <p> Orinda <p> COMPETITION INITIATIVE <p> Editor  --  It is now up to California voters if we are going to make the improvements on time and on budget that are called for in Gov . Davis ' new transportation plan . They will be coming face-to-face with the Fair Competition and Taxpayer Savings Initiative on the November ballot . <p> Voter approval could be critical to much-needed projects such as the addition of carpool lanes on Highway 101 through Marin and Sonoma counties , widening of I-880 in San Jose and Highway 101 north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Muni . <p> This straightforward initiative will save taxpayers ' money by encouraging the kind of competition that makes everyone work smarter and more efficiently and it will help speed up the safe delivery of thousands of backlogged projects , such as overpasses , bridges and schools awaiting earthquake retrofits , stalled highway , transit and road improvements and expansions , the building of new classrooms to accommodate more children , flood control improvements and other overdue projects . <p> That 's why it 's supported by the California Chamber of Commerce , California Taxpayers ' Association , Coalition for Adequate School Housing , Californians for Better Transportation , business , labor and 125 school districts , cities , counties , water districts and other agencies . <p> SCOTT MacDONALD <p> Taxpayers for Fair Competition <p> Burlingame <p> LESS BANG FOR THE BUCK <p> Editor  --  I 'm in agreement with Mr. Freeland of Orinda in asking , " Where Are Funds for Transit Projects ? " ( Letters , April 11 ) . Californians are the highest taxed citizens in the country ; all Bay Area bridges tolls went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which went from $2 to $3 . Maybe it 's time to bring The Little Hoover Commission in to " audit " government 's spending of those billions that get spent yearly in California 's state government . Pretty sad with all the taxes confiscated from the citizenry , we ca n't even get potholes repaired , let alone the Bay Bridge replaced . <p> GLEN REID <p> Oakland <p> BLINDED BY THE LIGHT <p> Editor  --  Reference John King 's article , " Neighbor-Friendly Lighting at Stadium . . . " on April 11 : <p> No complaints . . . hah ! Complaints are coming ! Complaints are building ! As president of the " Potrero Boosters Neighborhood Association , " I get them  --  by phone , by mail , by FAX . And I also have complaints ! <p> In fact , at our next neighborhood meeting , 8 p.m. , April 25 , at Jackson Playground , that will be the topic of discussion . We will be inviting , and we hope to have Giants representatives there . <p> I am sure it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of concern ever since their installation , testing , warming , curing , focusing and whatever else they have been doing with them way before the first exhibition game . <p> My personal opinion is that they are too bright , on too long and on too often . . . too many nights and early mornings until 7 a.m . So far they have been off only two days . Is that much use necessary ? Did they forget the light switch ? Are they forgetting to turn them off when they go home ? Why are they on on non-game days ? The lights are abusive of the communities . We have views of the bay , the Bay Bridge and the city , all of which are obliterated by the overpowering lights . <p> RICHARD C. MILLET <p> President <p> Potrero Boosters <p> Neighborhood Association <p> San Francisco <p> IF I 'D ONLY KNOWN . . . <p> Editor  --  Kudos to Kevin Fagan 's articles of April 10 , " Outcasts of the Reservations " and " Big Casino Transforms Life on Rancheria . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " outcasts " of their tribes before voting on Proposition 1A . Had I understood that only 13 percent of the state 's 300,000 American Indians would benefit from the promised gains of Proposition 1A , I would never have voted for it . <p> I wish Mr. Fagan 's articles had been more timely , or I had done more research other than my voting guides . I would love to see everyone boycott the Table Mountain Casino until they start dividing their new-found wealth among their whole tribe . <p> JANET HALEY <p> Larkspur <p> A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN <p> Editor  --  I have worked in a number of countries that feature in the top league of corrupt and feudalistic governments ( Haiti , Angola , Myanmar and Cambodia , to name a few ) and have to say that Willie Brown 's flagrant abuse of power , cronyism and pursuit of personal gain under the guise of mayor of San Francisco give these folks a run for their money ( no pun intended ) . <p> NINA FRANKEL <p> San Francisco <p> CLASS OF ' 45 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many people as possible to attend a 1945 class reunion from Edgemont and Northbrae grammar schools of San Bruno . The reunion will be held sometime during the last two weeks of August . We will notify everyone of the time and place when it is determined . Please contact Jack B. W. Ken at ( 650 ) 343-8037 ; or me at ( 650 ) 365-3477 , 41 Murray Court , Redwood City , 94061 . <p> FRANK LAWRENCE <p> Redwood City <p> ON THE ROAD <p> Editor  --  After most of 30-some-odd years , I am getting ready to be out of here , goin ' back to NYC and around the world . The memoir 's coming out at last and I 'm packing my bags . <p> In parting I 'd like to say , one of the best things we 've got going here is the local press . Almost every day ( except for when I was cold turkey in the monastery ) I 've read cover-to-cover every San Francisco newspaper I could get my hands on  --  a regular newsprint junkie . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as it is in this imperfect democracy , may be our last great hope . I became a writer of letters to reporters and columnists , cartoonists and the editor and got a few things printed . An odd little niche , civic crank . All I wan na say is , please keep the light on for me . . . I 'll be back late . <p> BARRY STEPHEN EISENBERG <p> San Francisco
