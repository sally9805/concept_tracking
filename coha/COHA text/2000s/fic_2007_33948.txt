Prologue In 1985 , in the village of Lolowa'asi , on the island of Pulau Nias , seventy-five kilometers off the western coast of Sumatra , a chieftain lies dying . Or rather , sits dying . It is still the custom on Lolowa'asi for a chief to deliver his obligatory deathbed oration sitting up in his elaborately carved wooden marriage bed , supported from behind , if necessary , by one or more of his wives , with the skull or the right hand of one of his enemies nearby , for him to take with him over the bridge to the next world . Sometimes a deathbed oration , summing up the great man 's life and reign as well as the history of the village , goes on for days . This one started several hours ago . But although all around the chieftain 's house village life continues as usual  --  women boil yams or work the fields ; men chop wood or feed and groom the pigs , which are the primary source and display of wealth in the island economy  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dying chieftain 's two potential successors has yet stirred from his bedside . There is a reason for this fidelity . In Lolowa'asi , both succession and inheritance are still conferred the traditional way : upon whichever of the heirs manages to be close enough to the chieftain at the ultimate moment to inhale his dying breath , which is believed to contain his sofu and fa'atua-tua , authority and wisdom , along with his all-important lakhomi , or spiritual glory . Together these comprise his eheha  --  his spirit , or immortal soul . Get the breath , you get it all : the pigs , the property , the spirit , the Great House . So the two heirs , bare-chested , with ceremonial gilt-threaded sarungs wrapped around their waists , wait and listen while the women come and go , bearing platters of rice and chicken and crackling pork . But there is one woman present who neither cooks nor serves . She is a young white woman , an American , half of a husband-and-wife team of anthropologists . She and her husband are using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional-culture village in the North Sumatra province of Indonesia . He operates the camcorder , while his much younger wife takes notes by hand . The anthropologists , who have heard about the deathbed ritual but never witnessed one , know what is supposed to happen next . According to tradition , after the oration and the deathbed blessings ( everyone in the room including the Americans is eligible for a kind word and a chunk of consecrated pig jawbone ) , the chief will remain sitting , supported by his wives , while his two sons shuffle in a circle at the foot of the bed . When his senior wife senses that the chieftain is dying , she will signal to the other wives . Together they will lay him back down , and the lucky heir who is closest to the bed at that moment will lean over the chieftain , openmouthed , and suck in the expiratory exhalation , sofu , fa'atua-tua , lakhomi , eheha , and all . Timing is everything  --  the Americans are expecting something on the order of a solemn game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak , stops . They 've even joked about it privately . But in the end there is nothing funny about what transpires this summer afternoon . The camera catches it all . Before signaling to the other wives that the time that will come for us all has come for the chieftain , the dying man 's senior wife surreptitiously signals the older son , the son of her own loins , Ama Bene , by putting the back of her hand to her brow as if in grief . He slows his pace and is standing by his father 's head as the old man is laid back down upon the batik-covered mattress . The scrawny bare chest  --  not even the wealthiest man in Lolowa'asi has much fat on him  --  falls , rises , falls again . Just as Ama Bene begins to bend over his father , the tape shows him being pushed violently aside , shoved all the way out of the frame , and as the room explodes into chaos , it is the younger son , Ama Halu , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He inhales deeply , a great , whooping gasp , and throws up his arms in triumph . But a moment later Halu staggers back from the bed , a bloody spearpoint protruding downward from his lower belly at an obscene angle . From behind him , Bene comes into the frame again , grasps the spear , and leans backward , placing his bare foot against his younger brother 's backside for leverage . The spearpoint disappears . Bene falls backward with the gory spear in his hand as Halu reels toward the female anthropologist . She catches him in her arms . Bloody froth bubbles from his mouth . Meanwhile , Bene has regained his feet and is charging toward the two . Clearly his intent is to reclaim the patrimonial breath , one step removed . But Halu has other ideas . He glances over his shoulder at his older brother , flashes him a bloody grin , then turns back to the woman . He clamps both hands around the back of her head and pulls her face to his , opens his mouth wiiide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth smeared with blood . She tries to turn her head , but even with Bene trying to separate the two , Halu 's death grip is unbreakable . Halu falls heavily to his knees ; the woman falls to hers . He breathes his last into her mouth as his brother clubs him repeatedly from behind with the butt of the spear . The woman feels the dull shock of the blows indirectly ; the front tooth that is chipped that day will never be capped . As for the dying breath , it is soft as a sigh , sour and coppery , and there is not , and will never be , a doubt in the woman 's mind that there is more to it than carbon dioxide . The hands clenched around her head relax ; the dead man topples to the floor . Kneeling alone now , she looks up  --  Ama Bene , the fratricide , stands over her , his face distorted with rage , gore-tipped spear drawn back . She gives him a bloody , triumphant grin . The blood and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the grin , however , is very much her own .
