Home-school hero Re : Hero ( December ) . Thank you so much for profiling Angie MeklenschekBlackman . I 'm a home-school mom of four : To find another home-school parent so prominently and positively presented made my day . I have now checked out Angle 's magazine , **25;2486;TOOLONG ! Thank you for your support of all parents - stay-at-home or employed , moms or dads , breast- or bottle-feeders , parents facing the challenges of international adoption or allergies or home-schooling . Whether we choose the mainstream or step outside it , we know that there is someone out there who will attempt to present the facts , tell a bit of our story and give us food for thought as we continue to do the best we can for our children . LARISSA MACDONALD Minnedosa , Man . Natural response RE : " CAN YOU SPOIL A BABY ? " ( Steps &; Stages , December ) . Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! This article almost had me in tears . My first child , Benjamin , was colicky and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timothy , has n't slept in his crib more than three hours , a handful of times . Otherwise he sleeps in our arms or next to us . I was told by nurses , doctors and lactation consultants to feed Timothy on schedule every four hours . I cried , knowing I would n't be able to hold him off , without him screaming for hours . My mother was the only one who told me to feed him when he was hungry and hold him when he cried . Timothy obviously needs that physical contact , which is OK with me . Benjamin is a wonderful boy and more loving and sympathetic than most kids his age , and Timothy will be as well . I am so grateful for this article because I knew my mom was right ; I just needed a second opinion . NATALKA WOODS Windsor , Ont . I LOVE THIS ARTICLE by Teresa Pitman . Far too often , well-meaning family members and health care providers end up undermining a mother 's instinct . Babies need to be close to their mothers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 've forgotten that . What they really need is skin-to-skin contact so they can bond , feed and gain confidence about the new world around them . So to the new moms out there , listen to your heart and what your instincts are telling you . You 'll rarely be wrong . KIMBERLEY FERNANDEZ CERTIFIED LABOUR DOULA Toronto Tutoring debate RE : " TO TUTOR , OR NOT TO ? " ( December ) . As an educator for 16 years and a mother of three - one with diagnosed learning difficulties - I have some concerns about your article on tutoring . I agree that " it 's OK to be OK , " as you put it . But if a child lags behind in those early years , the best approach is early intervention , if it 's available . At our school , if students are not at a specified reading level after completing grade primary ( entrance grade to public school in Nova Scotia ) , they are often referred to reading recovery . The most surprising statement is " If your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curriculum expectations . " This is not the case in our school - a grade of B is meeting expectations , whereas C is meeting some expectations . Getting a C once in a while is one thing , but when C 's are consistent , intervention is needed . This should not stress the child , but ideally give him what he needs , in a developmentally appropriate manner . P. LAW St. Margaret 's Bay , NS Holiday realities RE : " ( NOT so ) HAPPY HOLIDAYS " ( December ) . I just read John Hoffman 's column about the sadness that can come with the holidays . The last paragraph brought tears to my eyes and a lump to my throat . Your words touch on the true spirit of Christmas . SUSAN HACKETT By email Questionable advice RE : " STOP THE PRESSES ( PLEASE ) " ( December ) . Instead of admirably educating the public about questionable research reports , Today 's Parent commits the very faux pas of which you warn - not taking the writing seriously . How else can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why you can ignore it " ? This rather irresponsible choice of heading suggests that parents can simply ignore vital research pertaining to child health and well-being outcomes . A more appropriate subhead might have been " Why not to panic . " A coroner 's report says co-sleeping can be fatal ? Do n't blithely suggest it be ignored , and then try to use it to educate parents about safe choices . JENNIFER TIMER , MSN , RN Vancouver Flipping pages WITH A SMALL BABY , I usually have only one hand to hold your magazine while I 'm reading it . I find the cardboard advertising inserts extremely annoying . I realize advertisers do this intentionally , but for me as a reader , it makes my life more difficult . SHAYNA McKAY London , Ont . Ways to help RE : " BEHIND CLOSED DOORS " ( December ) . After reading this article about women and children in shelters , I want more information on where and how I can donate items in my area . GAIL LEE Uxbridge , Ont . From the editors : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs across the country to help women rebuild their lives after abuse .
