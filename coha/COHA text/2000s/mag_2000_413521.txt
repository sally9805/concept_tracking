This autumn three art galleries in New York City have mounted exhibitions devoted to a well-known American artist : John Marin at Richard York Gallery ( through December 9 ) ; Mary Cassatt at Adelson Galleries ( November 10 through December 29 ) ; and Everett Shinn at Berry-Hill Galleries ( November 28 through January 13 , 2001 ) . All of these artists spent time studying , if only sporadically , at Philadelphia 's Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts , but these exhibitions are visual testimony to the fact that even within the same generation ( in the case of Marin and Shinn ) this highly regarded art school turned out a remarkably diverse group of artists . John Marin is noted for watercolors and paintings that exude tension and energy ; they are like caged lions that roar with emotion . The exhibition at Richard York Gallery is entitled John Marin : The Painted Frame , which refers to the way the artist isolated images within his compositions through the use of framing devices . Later in his career , he took this aesthetic approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work or by extending the painted area beyond the canvas or sheet of paper to the wooden frame . In at least one case , a watercolor entitled Movement , Autumn ( illustrated below ) , he did both . The exhibition is the first to explore this aspect of the artists oeuvre . What gives Marin 's work its explosive appearance is his preoccupation with what he termed " things that clash . " This is particularly apparent in the paintings he executed after his return to New York City following a fiveyear hiatus in Europe , principally in Paris , between 1905 and 1910 . Although he often claimed that he paid no attention to the forerunners of modernism or the avant-garde artists of Paris , we know his works shared exhibition space with those of Cezanne and Matisse and that his Amencan expatriate friends included the modernists Alfred Henry Maurer , Arthur Beecher Caries , and Max Weber . Whatever the influences , Marin distilled them to create remarkably individual works of art . Photograph Momnent Autumn , by John Marm ( 1870-1953 ) , 1923 .

Another expatriate artist whose work Marin presumably encountered in Paris was Mary Cassatt . The cache of 204 works on paper that Cassatt kept in her possession until selling them to the wellknown dealer Ambroise Vollard sometime between 1906 and 1914 is the subject of an exhibition organized by Marc Rosen Fine Air . Entitled From the Artists Studio : Unknown Prints and Drawings by Mary Cassatt , it is on view simultaneously at the Adelson Galleries in New York City and at Meredith Long and Company in Houston . Among the items of particular interest are the color prints , known to connoisseurs and collectors as " the Ten , " which Cassatt worked on in 1890 and 1891 . According to Louisine W Havemeyer , her friend , patron , and champion of Cassatt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " much physical strain for she actually did the manual work " The prints , which went through numerous states , were finally issued in editions of twenty-five , and therefore are quite rare today The prints on view in this exhibition reveal the painstaking revisions Cassatt made before considering a work finished . Her experimentation with both color and composition is laid bare in these works , which are a supreme manifestation of her consuming passion for Japanese prints . These were compelling to Cassatt , and indeed to her French contemporaries , for their reductive compositions and their subject matter of women engaged in the activities of everyday life . The drawings in the exhibition , some of which relate to the Ten , provide additional insight into the artist 's working methods . Photograph The Fitting by Mary Cassatt ( 18441926 ) , 1890-1891 .

Everett Shinn , one of the members of a group known as the Eight ( whose first group exhibition took place in 1908 ) , studied at the Pennsylvania Academy from 1893 until 1897 , when he left to start his career as an illustrator . In that year , he moved to New York City where publishing opportunities in this profession were abundant . In 1899 he exhibited his pastels at the Pennsylvania Academy , but it was not until 1900 , when he traveled to Europe , that he began to paint in oil , and altered his professional goal from that of illustrator to artist . Like Edgar Degas , he painted scenes from the theater and dance , but in Shinn 's case it was popular theater that became his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in New York City , where he found his subject matter on the streets , which he painted with great energy . In 1907 his career underwent a third incarnation when he was commissioned to paint murals , and finally , about 1913 , he largely abandoned painting to become a set designer . Still later he was an artistic director in the film industry . The exhibition at Berry-Hill Galleries entitled Everett Shinn : The Spectacle ofLife comprises fiftyfive works in diverse mediums . It marks the one-hundredth anniversary of Shinn 's first one-man show in New York City and concentrates on the paintings in which he captures the hustle and bustle that has characterized the city to the present day . Among the works on view are several that have not been seen for decades , including Broadway , Late in the Af ten , won , ( illustrated above ) which , although painted before his departure for Europe , presages Shinn 's total immersion in the fast-paced street life of New York .
