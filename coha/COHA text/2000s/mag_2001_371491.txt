Billy Bob Thornton is on a mission to let you know he is n't weird . This is weird in and of itself , since he and his wife Angelina Jolie have spent a lot of time letting you know just how weird they are : wearing lockets with each other 's blood around their necks , getting matching tattoos with secret symbols only they know the meaning of , and wearing each other 's underwear . But now they want you to know all that stuff is n't so strange if you really think about it  --  or better yet if you do n't think about it . Instead , they 'd like you to know they spend most of their time watching the Game Show Network , playing board games and hanging out with their poodles . The Thorntons want to be taken seriously . <P> It should n't be all that hard , since no one could be as strange as they 've been made out to be . Sure , they like attention an awful lot and have a strange kind of self-focused intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe each other as " intense " and " heavy " and " feeling so much "  --  but they 're also surprisingly smart and laid-back and un-Marilyn Mansony . And besides , if Jolie is going to continue to serve as the goodwill ambassador for the U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees and Thornton is really going to have a shot at winning the best-actor Oscar in addition to being a respected indie writer-director who makes moody alt-country albums , they need to make sure people know they do n't have a dungeon in their basement and he does n't eat only orange-colored food and does n't think he 's the reincarnation of Benjamin Franklin . This is going to take him a while . <P> Thornton 's seriousness comes through best in his work , including the three movies he 's starring in this season : in Bandits , which opened last month , he plays a Woody Allenish neurotic bank robber ; in the Coen brothers ' retro film noir The Man Who Was n't There , he 's a poignantly understated 1940s Job ; and in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds a reason for living in a mixed-race relationship with Halle Berry . This guy does all right for himself . <P> It 's his stoic turn as the cuckolded barber in The Man Who Was n't There that 's generating the Oscar talk , despite the fact that the prize usually goes to more flamboyant roles . " The person who cries and screams at everybody wins the awards , " Thornton says . " The hard part is becoming the character so much , you 're not noticed . " <P> Still , it 's hard not to notice Thornton these days . In addition to the three films , he 's all over Tower Records on posters for his first album , Private Radio ( Lost Highway Records ) . He 's been in bands since he was a high school drummer in a ZZ Top-influenced band , but his album is stark and John Prinish , with lyrics that may be hurting his current campaign : he sings about wearing women 's underwear . Not only is Thornton planning to tour , but he 's already writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do after the covers of ' 60s tunes he 's currently recording in the basement studio of his house . If ever there were a need to be taken seriously , making an album with California Dreamin ' on it is it .
