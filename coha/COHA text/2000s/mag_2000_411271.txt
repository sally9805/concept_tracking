THE STEEP , SILENT side of a mountain . I 'm privileged this day , high in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California , to be enjoying some of the best downhill cycling in the country . Few riders know about these trails , which are like bobsled runs through a dense old-growth forest . For a few moments , I relive the confusing blur of my youth , and a pledge deeper than a resolution emerges from this morning ride . I 'm going to stay in good enough shape , maybe not to keep up with the local hammers , but to be able to ride with my children on a few cycling adventures as they grow up-to participate fully in their little blurs of happiness. - Metal Cowboy 4 PLACES YOU 'LL GO VERY , VERY FAST Markham Park , Fort Lauderdale , Fl. 954/389-2000 Wasatch Crest , Solitude Ski Resort Ur 800/748-4754 Mark Twain National Forest , Rolla , MO 5731364-4621 Nelson , British Columbia ( Gerick Cycles , Nelson ; 250/357-4622 ) When I was 11 , I started to collect stamps .

The bottles were worth two cents each at the Key Market . ( " Kid , most people wash the bottles out before they bring them in ! " ) With luck , I could get a block of four stamps at the post office next door . I still have that stamp collection , even though I have n't looked at it in decades . But the memories of those rides on that red J.C . Higgins bike are a prize possession I relive everyday . The bike gave me freedom and a couple of hours in the beautiful open air . Has much changed ? - Mike Kruger , Glenview , IL The group of weekend revelers in rural New Hampshire asked if I wanted to toss my bike and touring gear into the back of their car and come to a party .

The lake was a damn big puddle to circumnavigate , but 1 felt strong and I could almost smell the barbecue and hear the ski boat cranking up . " See you around lunchtime , " I hollered . Cresting the top of another in a series of hills surrounding the lake , I was sucking air . When a cyclist has one expectation-such as rolling roads along a peaceful lake-and reality turns out to be a series of steep climbs , it 's a psychological hammer blow and a great way to induce leg cramps . My map showed another 20 miles , but I did some creative addition and whittled that distance , at least in my mind , to less than 15 . Cyclists will tell themselves anything to keep going . I rubbed out a few cramps and concentrated on how I wanted my burger grilled . Not far from Wolfeboro , a scorching hill forced me to my feet . f felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maine . Pushing my alloyed albatross was bad enough , but the horn-honking from vacationers and half-lit party-goers filled the afternoon breeze . The pain of pushing is n't any worse than pedaling , just different . Exhausted , I arrived at the party well after the festive arc . People were on the mellow downside of the day . The volleyball games were over , the Jet Skis out of gas and a few withering hot dogs huddled on a paper plate like refugees after a bomb blast . But I gazed across the massive , simmering fake . The ride is the thing ... always has been , always will be . -M .

On my local riding turf we bristle a little when the term " expert " rears its pontificating head . If an " expert " does push through our somewhat lax security , we ride ' em hard and hang ' em up wet . I 'm always impressed with how much I do n't know , but then no one can swallow the ocean . My credentials include 12 years as a press journalist , and fm the author of Metal Cowboy : Tales from the Road Less Traveled . Add to that countless miles spent on the bike doing solo rides and pedaling for a touring company . So think of me as a somewhat knowledgeable friend riding just off your rear wheel .

You get the most bang for your weight with grains , beans , pasta and dried meats . The guys in our pack spotted the group first . A streak of female cyclists , all blazing past in a line on the other side of the highway . Normally , this would n't be a remarkable sight but we were in Matanzas , Cuba , and it was startling to see a bunch of professionallooking cyclists in a place where I 'd observed a family of four aboard a Chinese one-speed. // The women were actually girls from the Matanzas high school cycling team . There were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to . A small girl with a terry headband and piercing brown eyes found me . I could converse with her easily enough in Spanish . She was 15 . I was 37 . She grabbed me by the shoulder and pedaled along with me . " Are you tired ? I can help you ; she said with concern . I was n't , but she figured someone my age should be . This little slip of a girl who weighed 85 pounds began pulling me along . I weigh about 105 and was taller . I did n't want to tire her . So I challenged her to a race . She had a beat-up bike with gears that barely worked . I had a borrowed Cannondale hybrid and was pedaling in Tevas . For a while , she was beating me . I pulled ahead , breathing hard . She caught up and passed . I conceded . She drifted back , put her arm-around me again and asked , " Are you tired ? " Nah . Just old . Old and happy under Cuban skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm getting in shape for a big multiday tour . How much slower should I expect to go on a fully loaded touring bike than I do on my training rides ? Even though it 's an election year , I 'm not gon na put some politician 's spin on this one : The bags and gear WILL slow you down . I usually drop 3-4 mph during the first days of a fully loaded tour , but gain some of it back once I find my flow . If I maintain 19 mph during three-times-a-week training rides of 25-30 miles , then I 'd start the tour at 15-16 mph . What 's more important than speed is being able to maintain a solid cadence between 75-95 rpm and doing some training rides with your bike loaded . If on the first hill , your knees burn and pop and your expression looks like you 've been sucking lemons , train harder-or , better yet , train harder and cut back the weight . It 's crucial that you schedule light mileage during the first week of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days rather than crushing a century the first morning out the door . I tend to underprepare for long tours so I 'm a cursing , cramping , huffing and puffing mess the first few days , but hell week passes and I become king of the road  --  a touring legend in my own mind I Can I really hook up on singles tours ?

Having run a touring company , I watched three matches unfold in front of my eyes . ( I did n't see all the details-I did n't even try . ) Look at it this way : similar interests , time to talk and camping or hotels allow for privacy .

How Should I Carry My Bike On Public Transportation ? TAXI // This side of a dead body , most drivers will allow anything you can shove in the back seat or trunk . ( And , property concealed , dead bodies as well . ) Taxis have deep trunks-even boxed , my touring bike and gear easily fit . If the trunk wo n't close , who does n't carry bungee cords on an adventure ? I give away spare bungees to cabbies whose trunk locks no longer work , especially in Mexico . SUBWAY BOSTON : Five dollars buys a 3-year bike pass . CHICAGO : Allows bikes during the summer , except on weekends and July 4th . ATLANTA : Allows bikes any time . NEW YORK ; You can bring anything that fits inside the doors when they close . ( I did not make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free racks and lockers . DALLAS : Allows bikes during non-rush hours and on weekends . PORTLAND : Allows bike permanently with onetime , $5 permit . CITY BUS The latest government statistics on municipalities accommodating bikes on buses claims a 68% compliance rate . ( That sentence sounds so much like a government pamphlet it makes me shudder . ) Simply : More than half the cities with bus service have free bike racks . CHARTER BUS Greyhound charges $15 to transport your bike-and it counts as one of two allowed pieces of baggage . The box must weigh less than 60 pounds , so do n't jam in too much extra gear . If you use a hardshell case and no one asks what 's in it , you can avoid the fee . Watch at every stop to make sure your bike stays on the bus you 're riding .

Just call ahead to reserve a space . It 's excellent In Seattle and Portland , I buy my ticket beforehand and barely brake on my way over the platform and into the car . On the not of Amtrak 's routes , your bike costs $12 . But if you 're going to a smaller town that does n't staff its station , you ca n't check your bike at all . Only bikes going to big cities are allowed . Stupid . When you ride for days under the big trees of the Pacific Northwest , it begins to feel like everything around you is breathing .
