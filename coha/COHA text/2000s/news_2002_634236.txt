<p> Ousted school CEO Paul Vallas was a one-man headline machine from Day One . Duncan has avoided the spotlight in favor of a quiet , thorough , more studied approach to the problems of the nation 's third-largest school system . At times , he has seemed to be flying under the radar . <p> That all ended with a bang last week . <p> A concept that sources say Duncan pitched to win his new job  --  closure of failing schools  --  burst across the city 's front pages and TV screens . On Wednesday , Duncan and School Board President Michael Scott announced plans to shutter three chronically failing schools and reopen two of them in 16 months as new " Chicago Renaissance " schools . They held out the prospect of annual shutdowns and rebirths . <p> The toughest academic sanction since Daley won control of the schools in 1995 , Duncan 's plan drew immediate fire from an angry Chicago Teachers Union president , just months before new contract talks start . At least two targeted schools waged protests . <p> And more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues are being studied . They include reassessing the system 's coveted network of magnet schools , re-evaluating $116 million in busing services , ranking schools from best to worst for parents by this summer , and crafting a long-term plan to jump-start flatlined school performance . <p> These sensitive issues are being tackled against a backdrop of a state budget crunch and a sweeping new federal law that threatens to require the system to offer free busing out of hundreds of Chicago schools this fall if they do n't improve . The No Child Left Behind Act also could require Chicago to upgrade or replace hundreds of teachers by 2006 , despite a growing teacher shortage . <p> All that controversy sits on the doorstep as the city gets used to a new post-Vallas Chicago schools chief , and Duncan , 36 , gets used to his new job , now 10 months old . <p> In Duncan , Daley chose a 6-foot-5 basketball whiz with a lifelong passion for helping needy kids . Duncan has a closer working relationship with Daley than the more independent Vallas did . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A Harvard graduate , Duncan is studious , measured and press-shy  --  and so are many of his top people . Many call him the " anti-Vallas . " <p> " Being such a low-key person , there is such a contrast in styles , " one board member said . " Arne is not a publicity-seeking missile , the way Paul was . But part of the job is selling . He 's growing more comfortable with that now . But he was not comfortable with that as an approach early on . " <p> Closing schools has been such a historically volatile issue that Duncan will have to put on his salesman cap for it , as well as for other charged issues he 's examining . Said Ald. Patrick O'Connor ( 40th ) , chairman of the City Council Education Committee : " He 's got to go out and do a sell job now . " <p> Last week , Duncan and Scott toured the city 's editorial boards to sell their plan to pull the plug on the three troubled elementary schools and breathe new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , but Dodge and Williams will reopen in fall 2003 as new " Renaissance Schools , " with new leadership , new staff and a new vision . <p> Despite $18 million in help over the last six years and a series of expert partners , more than 86 percent of the students at all three schools are reading below national norms . At least 83 percent scored below grade level on a battery of state tests . <p> " These were schools , unfortunately , in which we did n't see any glimmer of hope , " Duncan told the Sun-Times editorial board Friday . " I have one shot at these kids . We can perpetuate social failure , or we can step up . " <p> Julie Woestehoff of Parents United for Responsible Education warned that the road ahead will not be easy . Parents say they are worried that their children will be in danger , crossing gang turf to get to their new , better-performing schools , she said . <p> And furious CTU President Deborah Lynch , who won office arguing that reform should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " teachers , said Duncan had betrayed her after telling her in February that no schools would be closed this fall . <p> Lynch 's anger marked the largest rift with the teachers union since Daley took over the schools . She contends that Duncan chose his plan , which could displace teachers , over her plan to let the union take over a failing school using existing staff . Now , Lynch said , " All bets are off . " <p> Duncan and Scott indicated a sales pitch will soon be heading Lynch 's way , too . " When she calms down , we 're going to pursue it with her , " Scott said . <p> Closing schools , Duncan said , was an idea he had considered since " Day One . " Other sources say he presented the idea to Daley when he interviewed for the CEO post . <p> Though the announcement was the most dramatic news Duncan has made in 10 months , it capped two weeks of whirlwind news conferences announcing the division of three flagging high schools into small schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee new teachers jobs by June 1 , so the best candidates are n't stolen away by the suburbs first . <p> Guaranteeing jobs in June , rather than August , could be " very expensive " because if the board overestimates its needs , " you eat those positions , " said Melissa Roderick , a University of Chicago school researcher who now leads strategic planning for Chicago schools . But Duncan said he thinks that 's what 's needed to attract better teachers . <p> For months , Roderick has been crafting a five-year plan to improve achievement in all schools , and she praises Duncan for letting the system take its time to develop that plan  --  and others now in the works . She said she 's conducting 50 focus groups of 10 people each in schools to " talk about the big issues " and track common themes . <p> That approach is typical of an administration that does not " shoot from the hip , " Roderick said . <p> Other big issues under analysis include the largest study of the city 's desegregation consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate how many magnet schools were desegregated under the plan and will be used to rewrite the decree 's underlying rules about the schools , officials said . A busing task force will use the data to suggest how to trim the system 's busing tab . <p> Duncan also is analyzing whether all magnet schools deserve that status , and whether new magnet schools or programs that base admissions on test scores should be added to the city 's West and South sides . <p> While Duncan unleashed the biggest school accountability hammer to date last week , he also is developing a one-page report card that will put accountability in the hands of parents by summer . It could cause uproar for principals . <p> Accountability chief Phil Hansen said schools will be graded by one number , from 0 to 100 , based on how they stack up on a range of factors , including test scores , test gains , attendance , percent of students promoted to the next grade , graduation rates , dropout rates and , eventually , their percent of temporarily certified teachers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues that are n't " sexy " but should produce long-term payoff and real change . Scott , who won Daley 's confidence over the years with his quiet troubleshooting on other jobs , agreed . <p> " Arne is not trying to run for governor , and I do n't have any political ambitions , " Scott said . <p> " Everybody was used to this oversell  --  ' I 'm going to do this , I promise to do that , I 'm going to build you a school . ' Everybody was used to these good-news stories . The fact is , that 's not how you execute change . "
