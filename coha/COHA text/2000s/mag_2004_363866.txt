You Yankee haters , you do n't understand America . You 've been deluded by the likes of Rocky , the Miracle on Ice and Clay Aiken into believing this myth that we are some sort of scrappy , underdog nation that needs to fight against the privileged bullies . Not me . I 've never rooted for underdogs , or , as I like to call them , losers . I loved the preening arrogance of those great Dallas Cowboys teams . I wish Shaq were a little bit bigger . For me , every Halliburton contract is a tiny victory . <P> And after a century of watching the Yankees club America 's small-market teams like baby seals and tigers and red sox , you have to suffer during the off-season too . In the biggest moral affront yet to your sense of fairness , last week the Yankees  --  already the richest , best team in baseball  --  traded for Alex Rodriguez ( A-Rod )  --  the richest , best player in baseball . The Yankees now have a slightly better lineup than the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the Yankees ' second baseman by the play-offs . <P> The worst part for you is that the rich Yankees got A-Rod at a subsidized price just by being smart . Baseball 's most expensive , egregious contract was given to Rodriguez three years ago by the Texas Rangers : $252 million over 10 years , much of which they will still have to pay to unload him . Imagine how much more they would have given him if President Bush were still the Rangers ' owner . That guy loves giving rich people more money . <P> Consider the A-Rod deal a Dr. Phil-esque opportunity for national self-realization . Americans have n't been underdogs since 1812 . We like to remember the Alamo because we fought long odds and had to give up an entire building ; the Mexicans remember Texas . If ever a country 's character demanded that it root against the underdog , it 's ours . We are the country of crushing , monolithic corporations  --  of McDonald 's , Wal-Mart and companies such as Aramark , Cendant and Sysco that are so powerful we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign dictators for looking at us funny . We are geniuses at supersizing the good stuff and McRibbing the losers . Underdogs are for Canadians . <P> The other 29 teams in Major League Baseball are around just to spur New York to further greatness , but when the Diamondbacks , Angels and Marlins do accidentally win , it 's all the more exciting for them because they felled the rich , advantaged Yankees . I know it seems unfair that New York 's vast television revenue gives the Yankees a permanent advantage . If all the cities had the same amount of money , every year might be as exciting in a roll-of-the-dice way , but there would be no truth in it . America is a nation of vast economic , educational and ethnic disparities . The Yankees are the real America . Where else can whites , blacks , Asians and Hispanics play happily together except on a team worth $180 million ? If I were an Inuit second baseman with a good on-base percentage , I 'd get my resume to the Bronx as soon as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
