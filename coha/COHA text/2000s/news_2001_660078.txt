<p> Ah , to be over 50 and on the dating scene . Again . It may not show up much on television or at the movies , but there is indeed a romantic world out there for unattached people who remember the Eisenhower administration . The swarms of available others do seem to dissipate as one waltzes past 40 and 50 , but mature singles say that even though the search takes a little more effort , the journey back into romance can actually be a lot more relaxed and fun than it was in their 20s . " It 's absolutely liberating , " says Judy , a Connecticut woman in her 50s . " Getting past the pressure of others ' expectations is absolutely fabulous . There is no expectation to have another child , there are no time limitations ... " and marrying in their 20s through 40s , few foresee a second era of singledom . " In life everyone is going to be single at some point . It 's totally natural , " says Margaret Kaplan , a psychologist in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana Halperin , a single woman on the brink of 40 , was feeling adventurous when she heard an announcement that the television show " Blind Date " was coming to town and was looking for participants . Then she heard : " So if you 're looking for a blind date and are between the ages of 22 and 38 ... " Ms. Halperin , discouraged , says she thought to herself , " Great . When did the world decide that 39 was out of commission ? " Most agree that it is more difficult to meet new people once you 're older . Ms. Kaplan gives out a three-page memo in her workshop of where and how to make connections in New York City . A guide like that has become so sought-after that Kaplan says people not in the class have offered to buy it . " It 's harder to meet people as you get older because you know more about what you 're looking for and you 're leading more with your head than with your heart , " says Carol Cooper , who runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners for singles . Older singles do say , however , that they feel liberated from the expectations attached to dating before a first marriage . " It 's a lot more fun at this age , now that there is so much less at stake , " says Christopher Hawes , a 40-something owner of a hair salon in Boston . " You have that confidence that you do n't have at a younger age , and you acquire more of a dimension , and that becomes alluring . " A 59-year-old teacher who lives in Westchester , N.Y. , and was married for 25 years before being widowed a few years ago says she often hears people say that older singles are looking for " companionship , " but that one does not outgrow wanting a deeper romance . " I am looking for a love interest , and not just for companionship , " she says . " I want the passion and excitement of a relationship . " Marcia Lewis was single for nearly 20 years after her divorce before she found another life partner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somebody tosses you a ball , " says the 60-something actress who is now performing in the show " Chicago " on Broadway . She met her new love a few years ago when a friend seated her next to another friend at a party in Venice . She and the slightly older Southern gentleman developed a long-distance friendship between New York and Nashville , getting together for lunch every couple of months . It was n't until he became suddenly ill that she discovered the depth of her feelings for him , and wrote him a heartfelt get-well letter that took their relationship to a new level . He recovered , and last November he proposed . The couple is getting married in June . " We 're going to have a big , beautiful New York wedding , with bridesmaids and all the grandchildren , " Ms. Lewis says with glitter in her voice . " I know it was meant to be . " Having managed some times of sadness over the years , she has advice for women her age : " You have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a go ! " Where to go , though ? Meeting casually becomes more of a challenge later in life , so organized events can be even more useful . Those who feel that attending a singles dance is just too reminiscent of high school , with the girls on one side of the gym and the boys on the other , can meet new people at group dinners for singles , or through an organization like The Language Club in New York , which every Monday seats individuals with others who speak the same second language to practice and socialize . The Bruce Museum in Connecticut holds Friday evening events with music and dancing for anyone who wants to come , although it is popular with singles as an alternative to a bar scene or a singles party proper . Judy in Connecticut belonged to a social group - that was not only for singles - for 10 years before she discovered a man who had been there all along . " We started talking and it was just comfort , " she says . " Immediately I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " even though she says he is not someone she would have been drawn to in her 20s . Women who run singles events say that women are more social than men in general and are more ready to move on after a divorce or being widowed . " Women tend to pick themselves up and get themselves out , " says Susan Kuper , who runs the National Singles Association , a local group in New York . Consequently , there are often more women at singles events and they seem more comfortable when they get there , Kuper and others have noted . And , in fact , there are more available women as a whole : 43 million of them , vs. 36 million single men as of 1998 , according to the US Census Bureau . The older the age group , the more pronounced the imbalance : of those 75 and over , 52 percent of women are single but only 21 percent of men . " When you 're married you think , ' Now I have my partner for life , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Jim Musnicki , a New Yorker in his late 40s who met his wife in high school and was married for more than 20 years before being widowed . " So you have to change your outlook a little and keep reminding yourself that you are single again . " That can be especially true for those who have been ensconced in marriage until they are in their 50s , 60s , or later - ages they never thought of as being a time for dating . Ann , a Westchester resident in her mid-60s who has been divorced for five years , says she has had to overcome a reluctance to get out on the singles scene . " In my mother 's generation , people would n't have thought of going out after 60 , " she says . " But times have changed . " Not for all . Ann describes a friend , also in her 60s , who has been widowed for 10 years and would n't think of going to a singles event . " She has X 'd the whole thing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art class or out with the girls , " Ann says . It used to be much more common for singles events to define the age group they were targeting . But since age is becoming increasingly irrelevant for couples today and many have an age gap between them of two decades or more , specifying who is invited does not happen as much . " Anyone is welcome to come to any event , because it 's not the age that matters but who they 're meeting , " Ms. Kuper says . " You never know who you 'll like . " However , Kuper holds events at various types of venues because they attract a concentration of different age groups . The Marion Smith Professional Singles group in New York states on the invitations to its dances that there are designated areas for those under 26 , those in their late 20s through early 40s , and those in their mid-40s and up , although they say co-mingling is fine . Of course , the last category includes more than double the ages of the other two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age matters . Older men chasing the younger women , however , is a classic scenario that discourages some older women from embracing the dating scene . " If there are younger women in a group , even if a man is pushing 70 or 80 he 'll go for them . It gets you in the gut , " says Ann . Elizabeth Dribben , a radio-arts commentator in New York who describes herself jokingly as " past the age of consent , " equates men picking up women decades younger with the awkwardness of wearing a toupee . " Why bother to do it ? Because it does n't make them look more virile , it makes them look silly , " she says . Ms. Cooper , however , notes that several of the couples who met at one of her singles dinners and eventually " walked off into the sunset together " were women in their 40s who clicked with men in their 60s . " Romance involves chemistry , and that does n't change whether you 're older or younger , but the expectations are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reverse scenario of older women dating younger men is becoming less uncommon , and more socially accepted . Judy knows a couple with nearly 20 years ' age difference . Although at first the woman was concerned that her being older would bother her boyfriend , it never has and their relationship is going fine . Public examples such as actors Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins are helping to break down cultural stereotypes . The man Judy is dating from her social group is a few years younger . She felt self-conscious about telling him that she was over 50 , more because of the notions she had growing up about people over 50 : " They became more matronly . You were done with your major projects in life like raising a family , " she says . " I feel more energetic and have more stamina than I did in my 20s . But I still do n't like the number ! " Those like Lewis who have weathered decades of the single life know that aging is like walking toward the horizon : the farther you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive there . " The stories I love to hear are when a couple went together as younger people and then went their separate ways and then ended up together , " Ms. Dribben says . " They 're older , they 're wrinkled , but there 's a comfort there , and the love in their eyes is so evident . They shine . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
