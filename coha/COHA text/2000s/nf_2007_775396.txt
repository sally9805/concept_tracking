ONE // Illusions on the Right // What Conservatives " Know " About 9/11 , and Why It ? s Wrong // THE REASON AMERICA ? S " war on terrorism " is imperiled is that there is no clear sense of who the enemy is . Is Al Qaeda the problem ? A network of terrorist groups operating through the Al Qaeda " franchise " ? State-sponsored terrorism ? Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of hostile states ? Or is Islamic fundamentalism to blame , since it appears to be the incubator of terrorism ? Or is the West facing a very old enemy , Islam itself ? // Not only is the identity of the enemy obscure ; many Americans also have no idea why these people are so murderously hostile to the United States . Five years after 9/11 , most people still have little sense of what would cause a bunch of men to want to blow themselves up in order to smash the Pentagon and topple the World Trade Center . The 9/11 Commission Report , for all its length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives no coherent explanation for why it occurred . // Americans  --  including the U.S. government  --  also seem confused about what is the overall objective of the enemy . Terror for its own sake ? U.S. troops out of Mecca ? The destruction of the state of Israel ? Islamic control of the Middle East ? World domination ? Moreover , since the enemy ? s goals are unknown , it is virtually impossible to figure out its strategy ; about all that seems known is that terrorism is one of its components . Without reliable knowledge of what the enemy wants and how it intends to achieve its goal , it seems virtually impossible to have an effective counterstrategy , either at home or abroad . In addition , America ? s people and leaders are deeply divided about whether this is a war with an end point , over what would constitute " success , " and over whether success is even possible in this new kind of war . // No nation ever won a war under these conditions . Therefore , the crisis of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understanding . To fight this war better it is necessary to understand it better . Therefore let us return to the beginning , to the cataclysmic attack that launched this new war for a new century . // Approximately five years after 9/11 , we know a great deal about that nightmarish event . Many Americans actually saw it happen . If you were watching television the morning of September 11 , 2001 , you would have had your programming interrupted shortly before 9 a.m . That ? s when the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center . Word spread rapidly , and millions of Americans were riveted to their TV sets when , a few minutes later , a second plane flew directly into the South Tower . The sight of the slow-motion collapse of these two landmarks of the New York skyline , with chaos everywhere and people running for their lives , will long remain etched on the national psyche . One of the most gruesome symbols of 9/11 was the sight of people jumping out of windows , preferring to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery inferno . Soon Americans discovered that a third plane had slammed into the northwest side of the Pentagon , and a fourth , headed for an unknown destination , had crashed in a field in Pennsylvania . As the magnitude of the disaster slowly registered , Americans saw heroic scenes of firefighters trying to rescue survivors , and poignant portraits of desperate New Yorkers trying to locate family members , hanging on to the slender hope that they had made it out of the burning buildings alive . Here is a typical plea , taken from a collection of recordings from the 9/11 archive : " If anyone has any idea , or if they ? ve seen him or know where he is , call us . He ? s got two little babies . Two little babies . " // It was the worst day in American history , worse than Pearl Harbor , worse even than Gettysburg . Those were military catastrophes , one of them off American shores , in which soldiers killed soldiers . By contrast , 9/11 was an attack on the American mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , and it took nearly three thousand lives , the vast majority of them civilians . The Cold War lasted for decades , cost hundreds of billions of dollars , and confronted Americans with the prospect of nuclear annihilation , but fewer Americans were killed over the entire duration of the Cold War than perished on a single day in September 2001 . What made 9/11 even more sobering was the recognition that its perpetrators intended to blow up the White House or the Capitol  --  the apparent destination of the fourth plane  --  and they meant to kill a lot more people . Nearly fifty thousand people worked in the World Trade Center , and the death toll from 9/11 could have been much higher . // Today , with the perspective of hindsight , and thanks to the detailed government investigation that culminated in The 9/11 Commission Report , we have a lot of information about 9/11 . We know a great deal about what happened and how it happened . We know that the original plan , proposed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , called for the hijacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasts . ( 1 ) ( Bin Laden settled for the final plan that was executed on September 11 . ) We can follow the movements of the terrorists in the period leading up to 9/11 . We have a detailed account of what they did that day : where and when they boarded the planes , when they spoke to one another , what they carried with them , and what they left behind in their rooms . The report has a moment-by-moment description of the climactic denouement . We can read heartbreaking transcripts of passengers calling family members to say " I love you , " and , " Good-bye . " We can hear what flight attendant Madeline Sweeney said as she saw American Airlines flight 11 zoom over the Hudson River toward the World Trade Center . " I see water and buildings , " Sweeney told her ground supervisor . " Oh my God , oh my God ! " // What The 9/11 Commission Report does not tell us , however , is why it happened . ( 2 ) On the subject of why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report is largely silent . This failure to comprehend the motives and goals of the enemy greatly limits the value of the report . Moreover , the report ? s discussion of the vital question of whether 9/11 could have been prevented suffers from an air of unreality . The report concludes that 9/11 could have been averted had America done this and that and the other  --  if only America had better control of its borders , if only the agencies of government were restructured to permit better sharing of intelligence , if only there were more systematic checks on airlines and other modes of transportation , and if only America had eliminated the Al Qaeda training camps and their support structures . // This conclusion is a fallacy . Call it the fallacy of retroactive insight . The characteristic feature of 9/11 was that it was a surprise attack designed to take advantage of an existing vulnerability in America 's defenses . After the attack , it is easy to say that we should have taken the measures that would have prevented the attack . But imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air strikes on Afghanistan prior to September 11 . Imagine if someone , prior to 9/11 , proposed restructuring the government at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars , restricting the freedom and convenience of Americans through extensive security checks and measures like the Patriot Act , and ousting the Taliban through military force . Such a person would have been dismissed as a paranoid and a crackpot , akin to someone today who called for America to take drastic measures to stop the Chinese from invading Florida . // In this sense , I do not believe 9/11 could have been prevented . // BUT WHY DID they do it ? The terrorists didn ? t leave an explanatory note , and the question of their motives has haunted America ever since the fateful attacks . At first 9/11 generated a spectacular moment of national unity , in which Americans came together to grieve over the terrible loss of life , acknowledge a new sense of shared vulnerability , and cherish the heroism of the police officers and firefighters . From the far ends of the world came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Le Monde ran a banner headline proclaiming , " We are all Americans . " // At the same time , however , Americans were startled by the reaction to 9/11 from certain quarters of the Muslim world . " Allah has answered our prayers " declared the Palestinian weekly Al-Risala in its September 13 , 2001 , issue . The Egyptian newspaper Al-Maydan noted that when the news broke that the towers were hit , " Millions of us shouted in joy . " There were celebrations in Lebanon , Syria , Pakistan , and Jordan . Even in London , some Muslims rejoiced and Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed preached a sermon in his mosque calling September 11 " a towering day in history " and hailing the " magnificent 19 " for what they did . ( 3 ) In many parts of the Muslim world , Osama bin Laden became an instant sensation for having hit America where it hurt . Americans who hoped that these reactions were grotesquely aberrant , and expected them to be strongly repudiated by the rest of the Muslim world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9/11 , and furious at this bloody assault on civilian life , American leaders and opinion makers responded with instinctive and sputtering contempt toward their attackers . Several TV commentators and talk radio hosts proclaimed the 9/11 attackers " insane . " Columnist Thomas Friedman declared that Osama bin Laden was simply " a psychopath . " Another theory was that 9/11 was pointless , what scholar-activist Edward Said termed " a terror mission without message , senseless destruction . " Historian Stanley Hoffman , not previously known for his expertise in Koranic interpretation , noted that the bin Laden crew were acting " on so peculiar an interpretation of the Koran that there is very little one can do to rebut it . " President Bush took up this theme on September 20 , 2001 , charging that the 9/11 attackers " blaspheme the name of Allah . The terrorists are traitors to their own faith , trying , in effect , to hijack Islam itself . " Columnist Barbara Ehrenreich suggested that 9/11 was an uprising on the part of the wretched of the earth , seeking to remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted . " Writing in The New Yorker , Hendrik Hertzberg and David Remnick announced , " This is a conflict that pits all of civilized society against a comparatively small , essentially stateless band of murderous outlaws. " ( 4 ) // It is easy to sneer , with the benefit of hindsight , at these outlandish theories . But there was a good deal of evidence even at the time they were uttered that they were wrong . Clearly the terrorists were not insane , or they could never have pulled off the most successful terrorist attack in history . By all accounts 9/11 required a degree of imagination , precision , and coordination of which insane people simply are not capable . At the meager cost of $500,000 , and armed only with box cutters , the 9/11 hijackers managed to inflict heavy casualties , cause hundreds of billions of dollars of damage , and transform the way of life of the world ? s most powerful nation . ( 5 ) Since bin Laden was one of the richest men in the world , his deputy Ayman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Egypt , and most of the 9/11 hijackers from educated middle-class backgrounds , 9/11 was hardly a poor man 's uprising ; one might almost call it " terrorism of the rich . " By all accounts bin Laden and Zawahiri are deeply pious Muslims , and the diaries left behind by the 9/11 hijackers show them to be equally sincere and devout . ( 6 ) There are many people in the Muslim world who disagree with bin Laden and the perpetrators of 9/11 , but few Muslim clergy consider them to be apostates or betrayers of Islam . Moreover , it was clear from the beginning that lots of Muslims supported and rejoiced in 9/11 , and that far from being stateless outlaws , bin Laden and his men enjoyed the sponsorship and support of at least one Islamic regime , the Taliban government of Afghanistan . // These errors are not surprising . The mood in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 was disturbed and intemperate . Many Americans expressed the view that they didn ? t care why America was hated ; they just wanted to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to obliterate them . No wonder that many senseless things were said in this truculent frame of mind . What is surprising is that for a time there was moral and ideological unity in America of a kind not seen since World War II . Suddenly the old divisions in America  --  over race , over taxes , over the Clinton legacy , over the 2000 election and the Supreme Court decision that put Bush in office  --  evaporated . The whole nation felt itself under attack by a common enemy . One powerful symbol of this unity was the sight of the entire U.S. Congress , conservative Republicans joined by liberal Democrats , singing " God Bless America " in front of the nation ? s Capitol . Despite their previous disagreements , the Democrats in Congress pledged to support President Bush in a unified national response to 9/11. // Even old ideological adversaries began to speak the same political language . A few days after the attacks , the New York Times declared that bin Laden and the hijackers " acted out of hatred for the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity , religious pluralism , and universal suffrage . " ( 7 ) I am not concerned at this point with the veracity of the Times ? s statement . I am struck , however , that a major newspaper that can be relied on to condemn President Bush here sounded exactly like him . Thus 9/11 produced something that Americans once took for granted but now experienced as a novelty . One America . One America united against its enemies . // But this moment of national unity was brief . It lasted as long as the impact of 9/11 was fresh . But as soon as that emotional wound began to heal , the moral and ideological unity disappeared and a furious debate broke out over the meaning of 9/11 . This debate has only intensified the division in the country , revealing the division to be bigger than 9/11 , bigger even than foreign policy . Ultimately 9/11 has exposed a deep chasm in the American soul over the meaning of America itself . // I WANT TO begin by discussing the mainstream conservative view of 9/11 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against terrorism . This view is sometimes called the " neoconservative " approach , although I believe it is wrongly labeled as such . Some neoconservative strategists may have helped to devise it , but ultimately it is President Bush who adopted it and it is the Bush position that enjoys general support on the right and in the Republican Party . I recognize of course that there are dissident factions on the right , primarily the Buchanan wing of the " old right " and the libertarian critics . I will address their views later . Here I outline the central principles of Bush ? s conservative understanding of 9/11. // Library of Congress subject headings for this publication : // United States  --  Foreign relations  --  2001- // War on Terrorism , 2001-  --  Moral and ethical aspects . // Anti-Americanism  --  Islamic countries . // Liberalism  --  United States . // United States  --  Civilization  --  Foreign public opinion , Muslim . // United States  --  Moral conditions  --  Foreign public opinion , Muslim . // Popular culture  --  Moral and ethical aspects  --  United States . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries  --  Relations  --  United States . //
