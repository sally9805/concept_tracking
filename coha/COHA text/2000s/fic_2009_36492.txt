Judge Rollins drew a handgun from beneath his black robes , pointed the snub-nosed barrel at Jimmy Payne 's chest and said , " Who you pimping for , you low-life shyster ? " <br> Payne gaped at the revolver . <br> This can not be happening . <br> The judge gestured toward the stacks of hundred-dollar bills on his desk . " C'm on , Payne . You 're not smart enough to dream this up on your own . " <br> They faced each other in the judge 's chambers , a tranquil refuge of leatherbound books and walnut wainscoting . Payne felt his knees wobble . " I swear , Judge . I just represent the defendant . Ramon Carollo . " <br> " Not like you to defend human traffickers . I remember the hell you raised when those wetbacks got barbecued in a trailer truck . " <br> " I like to call them ' undocumented aliens . ' ? " <br> " Why ? They from Mars ? " <br> The judge vaulted out of his high-backed chair . Quick for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers on a snow goose . Shoulders as wide as a bookcase . <br> " Take off your clothes , Payne . " <br> " What ? " <br> " You heard me . " <br> " I swear I 'm not wearing a wire . You can pat me down . " <br> " Strip ! " <br> Payne was n't sure he could . His joints seemed rusted shut . <br> " Now ! " <br> With jerky motions , Payne kicked off his shoes , unhooked his belt , and dropped his trousers . <br> " You bring me nine stacks of hundred-dollar bills , fifty to a stack . " Judge Rollins motioned toward the open briefcase on his desk and did the math in his head . " Forty-five thousand dollars . " <br> " That 's the offer , " Payne agreed . <br> " Odd amount . Like it was supposed to be fifty thousand , but some half-assed bag man skimmed five off the top . " <br> " No , sir . " Payne lowered his tie and slipped out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend . " <br> " No sale , shitbird . " <br> " I thought it was worth a shot , Your Honor . But let 's just forget the whole thing . I 'll put my pants on and  --  " <br> " Drop those undershorts , too . " The judge waved the gun like a king with a scepter . <br> Payne pulled down his red-and-white boxers with the Los Angeles Clippers logo . He preferred them to the Lakers purple-and-gold shorts , not for the colors , but because he favored underdogs . <br> " Now turn around and spread your cheeks . " <br> " No way , Judge . " <br> " Do it ! " <br> At thirty-seven , Payne was in good shape . Flat stomach , decent chest , a sinewy runner 's body . He spun around and bent over . " Like I said , Your Honor , no wire . " <br> Judge Rollins gazed off . " I do n't know whether to shoot you or arrest you . " <br> Jimmy straightened and turned around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of good I can do out there . " <br> " Out where ? You 're Jimmy Payne . Royal Payne . You cut corners . You represent undesirables . You piss people off . " <br> " Honestly , Judge . I 'm gon na change my life . " <br> " People do n't change , Payne . They just get old and die . Sometimes , they do n't even get old . " <br> Payne stepped sideways toward a set of shelves decorated with framed vanity photos . Judge Rollins with Mayor Villaraigosa , Senator Boxer , some local bigwigs , and a pretty young woman in a pink sash , the Rose Bowl queen , maybe . Alongside the photos , the scales of justice . Bronze . Heavy . Tilted heavily to one side . One more step and Payne could grab the scales by the blindfolded lady and take a swing at the judge . <br> " Freeze , sleazebag . " Rollins pulled back the hammer of the .38 . As the click echoed in his brain , Payne thought of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cheeseburgers . Surfing . A boy needs his father . <br> Just how the hell did I get into this ? <br> Continues ...
