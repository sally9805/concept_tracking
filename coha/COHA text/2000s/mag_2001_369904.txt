Rethinking the SATs <P> " Instead of creative thinkers , we are producing anxious test takers . Teachers are teaching to the test , it 's clear , and it 's epidemic . " PAUL NOVAK Asheville , N.C. <P> The move by the University Of California and other institutions to reduce the importance placed on the SATS is admirable EDUCATION , March 12 . These schools realize that great students are not necessarily great test takers . Although the SATS are designed to measure verbal and math skills and indicate one 's inherent ability , a number can not truly define a person 's intelligence . Innate ability undoubtedly plays a role in success , but hard work is just as important . For colleges to see what a student has to offer , they must look beyond test scores and into the realm of the unquantifiable . RYAN PENNING Rocky River , Ohio <P> You asked , " Do we want a society that rewards genes ? Are we afraid of what kind of society that may be ? " The U.S. is that society now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artistic talent , and athletic ability with fame , fortune and special treatment . The only genetic gift that we do not reward on its own merits is intelligence . In fact , we try our best to be politically correct by saying intelligence is not genetic . LEE T. MARCH Joplin , Mo . <P> Thirty years ago , when I took the SATS , you showed up on a Saturday morning and took the test . To prep , you made sure you did n't stay out late on Friday night . DAVE HAUGHEY Fort Collins , Colo . <P> It is ironic that we find ourselves questioning the fairness and usefulness of the SATS at a time when state-required competency exams are popping up all over . In these state exams , I see the same test-prep problems , bias , racial gaps , memorization and the same testing mania that we fault the SATS for . State-required competency exams can cause even more pressure and greater consequences , since in many states these tests are a requirement for graduation , the hurdle students must pass before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their SATS . SARAH CHOU Los Altos , Calif . <P> The SATS may not be perfect , but colleges need something besides high school transcripts to evaluate students . Two schools at which I taught were rife with grade inflation . Now I teach in college , and after a couple of weeks it 's obvious to me which students ' high school grades were fudged . They usually receive poor college grades and often end up dropping out because they ca n't handle the work . No , the SATS are n't perfect , but to admit students solely on the basis of grades earned in secondary school would turn into an unqualified disaster . CANDACE MURDOCK Rome , Ga . <P> How can a single test that is n't even based on school curriculums count for so much ? The smartest thing to do would be to give the SATS less value . But some of the " alternatives " to the SATS unhinged my jaws . I believe that knowing mathematical formulas is still more reasonable for a standardized test than constructing Lego robots or writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several sharp-eyed readers questioned the oddly numbered SAT scores of some of the famous folks we listed ( Ben Stein , 1573 ; George W. Bush , 1206 ; Al Gore , 1335 ) , noting that SAT numbers today are rounded off to the nearest 10 . The College Board began to round off test scores only in 1970 . <P> Death on the Farm
