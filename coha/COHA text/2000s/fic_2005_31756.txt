Chapter One There is a beat in this city , like the throbbing of arteries when the heart contracts . New Orleans has its own pulse . I hear it now , getting faster . Steam vents through grills in the street . If they pumped blood from those grates the air would turn red , but the pressure would ease . It 's early , early enough the breeze through jasmine does n't take the edge off last night 's scent of booze , sweat and urine . This waterproof bike suit makes me sweat and the helmet does n't help anything . Concentrate . My timing must be as perfect as it was the first time . I 've already seen her several times . The one . Rich , spoiled , dissatisfied and looking for more treasures to buy , to stuff in the bottomless cavity she thinks is her desire . Boredom is the name of that cavity , and fear . The boredom of a woman who has everything but purpose . She would never confess to fear but it 's there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . One of them has ruined my life by using my talent and ignoring my existence . Concentrate . Antiques , Diamond and Gold Jewelry by Xavier Tilton . Whooee , that is some name to fill up an awning over a shop door . Shops like this one cram Royal Street , but I picked out Xavier Tilton 's place for the diamonds - and thelong-legged woman who comes at the same time on the same morning each week . Tilton carries more diamonds than any other place I 've checked . They shimmer and flash inside glass-fronted display cases lining the walls . No fingerprints on that glass ; Xavier carries a half-mitt in his pocket and moves behind customers discreetly wiping away any evidence of their presence . He 's doing it now , sliding behind her , talking and wiping . It 's time . They 're alone in there and the street is almost empty . Nothing but a few stinking , sleeping no-names covered with piles of rags . Once I 'm in the shop I 'll close the door to keep the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it stops here I 'll have to change plans . Come on , come on . Jeez , a friggin ' turtle . Move . Good , it 's parking over there , the driver 's leaving the engine running . Any distraction is good . Call Xavier to the courtyard behind the shop , to the deliveries gate . Now ! Move your feet . Walk into the alley beside the shop and press the button beside the pretty iron gate . " Xavier Tilton here . " " Mornin ' , Mr. Tilton . Gift delivery from Blossoms . " " Bring it into the shop . " Shit . " It 's a fern of some sort . A tree . ' Bout seven foot . " " I 'll meet you at the delivery gate . Give me a couple of minutes to get through the courtyard . " Do that , Xavier . Take your time getting to your gate . I 'm the one who has to get inside the shop and keep moving until this is finished . It 's raining again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ammonia and stinkin ' candles . Bless you , Xavier , for the classy music . Nothing like a little opera early in the morning . The seconds are ticking away now . How long before Tilton comes back ? The woman has heard me coming into the shop . " Mornin ' , ma'am . " Do n't I sound friendly ? " Good mornin ' to you , " she says . " He 'll be right back . " Pretty face . Smooth blond hair . Much younger than I thought . Too bad . She wants something in the case , ca n't look away from it for more than a second . Her purse is small - no straps . Fate is smiling . Take out the pick and palm it against my thigh . Cram the dark visor down . Stay cool . Two steps ... and strike . Ouch , it goes in easy enough until she falls and her weight hangs on the pick . Damn blood everywhere , running down the visor and blurring everything . Wipe it on your sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance from me she falls forward and through the glass and she does n't say a word , does n't scream . That 's because she 's already dead - or close to it . How many more seconds ? If he catches me it 's over . I can see her in the mirrored back of the case , sliding down , breaking shelves , tipping all the pretty things . She 's not pretty anymore . Pull the pick out . NOW . Grab the purse and stuff inside the suit . Move my feet , back away , put the pick in its thigh pocket , open the door , close it behind me and walk away . Walk fast but not too fast - to the corner , turn , and there 's the bike . I 'm away and heading for that coulee and the ruined shack . It was n't the woman 's fault , not really , she was in the wrong place at the wrong time - for her . This suit does n't keep the wind out , or am I cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck and should turn this oilskin stuff into a sauna . I 'm going where I went before , out past the zoo . Soon the scenery gets lonely , the undergrowth is burned , and rotting trees lean this way and that . The deeper I go , the more deserted it feels . The coulee is n't deep enough but it 'll have to do . The rented bike goes into the barn . My own wheels never looked so good . Off with the suit and wrap the helmet and purse inside , and the gloves , the black tennis shoes , underwear , too . Now I stuff the lot into a double garbage sack but I ca n't load it until I wash . The soap is still where I hid it . Colder , the water should be colder and chafe my skin red and clean . My feet cling to slimy gravel and tree roots . Why do I shiver when I 'm not cold anymore ? Soap coats me and I rub it in hard , dig my fingernails into the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bleed , I want to hurt . A pebble , large and porous like pumice - yes , it will clean me . It tears into my upper arms , into the skin on my belly and buttocks , the backs of my thighs and my elbows . Long red stripes that pop bubbles of blood , then begin to seep in ragged rivulets quickly mixed to a bloody wash by the water . I want to lay the flesh on my face raw but everyone would see it . Sometimes a sacrifice must be made - as an example . I did n't want to do it the first time or this time , but I had to , Sonja made sure of that . Sonja owes me . God help me , one more to go . The Times Online New Orleans Tuesday , October 23 Yesterday morning an as yet unidentified woman died when she fell into a jewelry display case at a Royal Street antique shop . Owner Xavier Tilton , alone with the woman at the time , received a call to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time he returned she appeared close to death and did , in fact , expire before the police and aid units reached the scene . Although Mr. Tilton is sure the victim carried a purse , no purse was located at the Royal Street shop . Mr. Tilton reported that the deceased had been interested in an antique diamond ring in the case . After the incident , no merchandise appeared to be missing . The ring the victim was considering remained on her finger . No official comment has yet been made , but information from a credible source revealed that the crime has been classified as murder . A tentative link has been made to the bizarre murder of Stephanie Gray during Mardi Gras two years ago . At that time a close friend of Miss Gray said the victim had traveled to New Orleans to try out for a place in a band . The friend did not hear from Miss Gray after she boarded a bus in Bismarck , ND . At the autopsy it was discovered the woman had most likely died before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as probably an ice pick had been stabbed beneath the base of her skull , then removed . No purse or other personal possessions were ever found . Our sources tell us yesterday 's Royal Street victim also sustained a mortal wound to the brain , most likely inflicted with an ice pick , and used in part to drive her through a heavy glass door in the display cabinet . Last Friday , Charles Penn , convicted murderer of Stephanie Gray , escaped while being transported between maximum security facilities . He remains at large . ( Continues ... )
