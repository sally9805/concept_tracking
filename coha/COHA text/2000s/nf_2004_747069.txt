Section : Reports : Mexican Immigrants in Florida Mexicans are the second largest group of Latin Americans in Florida , but their presence is often overlooked <p> Florida is in the midst of a dramatic demographic transformation . Over the past several decades , the state has become home to millions of Latin American immigrants . The 1950s to 1980s were characterized by the massive influx of Cuban exiles to South Florida , but recent years have brought waves of immigration from other Latin American countries : Venezuelans fleeing political upheaval , Argentines fleeing financial ruin , Haitians fleeing poverty and oppression , and Colombians fleeing a continuous cycle of violence . Like the Cubans who arrived before them , each diaspora is unique , and each group could potentially wield an enormous political , cultural and economic impact in the state . With the exception of the Haitian and Colombian diasporas , however , Florida 's new immigrants have not been the subject of extensive research . The Miami Cuban community continues to receive the most attention , thanks in no small part to its political clout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida have gone largely unnoticed . <p> In the last decade alone , Florida has witnessed a staggering 125.3% increase in its Mexican population , according to the 2000 Census . Mexicans are now the second largest Hispanic immigrant group in the state . As of 2000 , 363,925 Mexicans were living in Florida , most of them concentrated in the southern part of the state - not counting undocumented immigrants , who may number upwards of 200,000 . Such a large yet largely overlooked population raises several critical questions : Why are so many Mexican immigrants choosing Florida as a destination ? What are the major characteristics of this understudied population ? How are Mexicans adapting to Florida society , and do they retain ties to Mexico ? And , most important , why is this enormous population all but invisible ? <p> The information presented in this article is based on a research project conducted by the Florida-Mexico Linkage Institute and the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University . The study was primarily qualitative in nature , although it also consulted secondary quantitative data sources such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other recent studies of the Mexican immigrant population in Florida were also useful , most notably the work on Clearwater by Maria Crummett and Ella Schmidt at the University of South Florida . The primary data method selected was focus groups , supplemented by individual interviews and entrance surveys in cities and towns throughout the state . Characteristics of Florida 's Mexican Population <p> Traditionally , most Mexican migration to Florida has been temporary or transient , linked to the winter vegetable industry . As the recent census discovered , however , a sizable number of migrants have chosen to make Florida a permanent destination . What the official figures do not make clear is that there are two broad types of Mexican populations in Florida : rural , primarily agricultural laborers confined to small towns in the interior of the state ; and an urban professional class concentrated in the major coastal cities . In metropolitan areas such as Miami , Tampa , Aventura and Clearwater , " transnational " Mexican professionals are strengthening the economic and financial ties between Florida and their home country . <p> Both rural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity . Despite improved economic performance under the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , Mexico 's rural sector continues to struggle with poverty . Extreme poverty - the kind that makes a family incapable of sustaining itself - affects 42% of rural Mexican families , compared with only 12% of urban families . Wage comparisons between the United States and Mexico illustrate the mechanisms of " push-pull " economics : More than 50% of Mexicans earn an average annual wage of $2,500 , while the median income for Mexican households in the United States is $22,400 . Substantial research examining the economic motivations for migration has concluded that many families in Mexico see migration as a way to diversify economic opportunity . Family members sent to work in the United States sustain their relatives in Mexico through remittances , which bring almost $10 billion into the country annually . The " pull " of Florida is apparent : Florida 's economy ranks fifth in the United States , with an annual growth rate of 5.6% , attracting thousands of immigrants from the primarily rural states of Guerrero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estimated 400,000 Mexicans work in Florida 's strawberry , tomato and citrus fields . The majority of rural Mexicans interviewed for the FIU study work in agricultural sectors , picking fruit or vegetables or at other jobs in nurseries or produce packaging plants . Most rural migrants hear about these opportunities through family connections and informal immigrant networks , which serve as an important source of information for recent arrivals . When asked why they chose Florida , the most common refrain among the rural Mexicans interviewed was a simple , straightforward answer : " I was told there was work " by family or friends who were already established in the state . <p> In contrast , Mexican urban professionals choose Florida for its connections with the rest of Latin America . Miami is increasingly the main portal for US trade and financial transactions with the region . The majority of the Mexican business class in Miami is employed in banking , private enterprise or multinational corporations . Increased flights and transportation links between the United States and Latin America have helped facilitate commerce and connections between Florida and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per month to conduct business , and they report that the ease of travel has helped nurture growing business ties . Unlike rural workers , these professionals were not " pushed out " of the Mexican economy ; almost all of those interviewed held similar jobs in Mexico and came to Florida for professional development . Thus , while both rural and urban Mexicans choose Florida for employment reasons , there is one substantial difference : Rural workers migrate because they lack economic opportunities , while urban professionals look to enhance opportunities they already enjoy in Mexico . <p> Crummett and Schmidts study of Mexicans in Clearwater focuses on a special subset of the urban population . Pinellas County is home to some 11,000 Mexicans , almost all of them from the small town of Ixmiquilpan , Hidalgo , a primarily indigenous area . In the past 10 years , more than one-tenth of the town 's residents have immigrated to Clearwater . Located on Florida 's tourist-reliant " Treasure Coast , " Clearwater offers employment opportunities in an urban , service-oriented economy with room for upward mobility . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels and restaurants , but many have moved on to run their own restaurants , small stores and markets . Contributing to this success is a strong migrant network made possible by the common background of the area 's Mexican residents ; while Mexicans in the rest of the state are a diverse group , the majority of the Clearwater community is from the same hometown , culture and economic class . Adaptation and Immigrant Identity <p> The notion of adaptation is crucial in future immigration policy considerations for the state and federal governments . How the Mexican population in all its diverse demographics is incorporated into Florida society depends on several factors , among them social cohesion and political strength . Mexicans are the second-largest immigrant group in Florida , yet they are the most socially and politically invisible . In almost every focus group , respondents unanimously acknowledged the absence of a united Mexican community in Florida , either at the rural or urban level . Most of those interviewed cited specific cultural reasons preventing cohesion , among them a tendency toward individualism , isolation and the varied backgrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , include individuals from different Mexican states and cultural traditions . Many of them are more comfortable communicating in indigenous languages instead of Spanish , let alone English . Urban Mexicans in Florida , although enjoying better networking opportunities and access to organizations such as the Mexican-American Chamber of Commerce , also report a general lack of unity or cohesion that contrasts with the highly visible political and social presence of Mexicans in the Southwest . <p> The Clearwater Mexican community , in contrast , enjoys both social solidarity and ethnic cohesion . These characteristics go a long way toward explaining the relative success of the community . According to Crummett and Schmidt , indigenous migrants from Hidalgo transplanted the strong ethnic networks that characterized their communities in Mexico to Florida . Their experience highlights the importance of ethnic ties in promoting a common identity and establishing an ethnic enclave , factors that facilitate cohesive adaptation to US society and upward social mobility . Transnational Activity <p> The conditions characterizing Mexican immigration to Florida do not , as a rule , facilitate transnational activity . Although the urban professional class has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is generally apathetic with regards to participation in transnational activity . While all interviewees agreed on the importance of maintaining ties with Mexico , few possess the resources or the will to do so . Rural migrants are transnational only inasmuch as they send remittances back to Mexico ; otherwise , they have neither the time nor the resources to establish a viable transnational connection . But perhaps the most important predictor of a transnational migration pattern goes back to one of the basic problems affecting the Mexican population in Florida : the lack of a cohesive social identity either in Florida or in Mexico . Transnationalism explicitly encompasses the importance of retaining cultural , political and economic links to the home country to strengthen and sustain both native and immigrant communities abroad . In a sense , transnationalism represents a symbiotic relationship between home and immigrant communities ; hundreds of small town in Mexico enjoy the financial benefits of remittances , and immigrant communities abroad use such ties to nourish and preserve their ethnic and communal identities . While most transnational activity , such as remittances , is explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the border rests almost exclusively upon the ephemeral notion of a strong " community " identity . <p> The explicit transnational ties exhibited by the only Mexican community in Florida with a firm ethnic identity - the one in Clearwater - support this assertion . The Clearwater residents have a strong and resonant transnational relationship with Ixmiquilpan . Millions of dollars in remittances connect the two cities , and the governor of Hidalgo has become a frequent visitor to Clearwater . Focus group participants described the connection to their hometown as a source of pride and self-worth ; immigrants to Clearwater are expected to become " patrons , " paying for holiday celebrations back home and building large houses in preparation for their eventual return . They also represent virtually the only source of community revitalization in Ixmiquilpan , including construction and maintenance of the town 's infrastructure . In turn , conservation of language and culture in the migrant community is of extreme importance . This strong ethnic identity virtually ensures continued links to the hometown and culture . The Future of the Mexican Population in Florida <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will adapt and integrate into US society in different ways . Migrant farm workers , who represent the majority of the state 's Mexican population , face two of the most difficult challenges for any immigrant group : undocumented status and stalled socioeconomic advancement . Legal status has a profound effect on the level and pattern of integration . Undocumented immigrants lead a clandestine , insecure existence , with integration hampered by the fear of deportation . Although wages are higher in Florida than in Mexico , poverty among farm workers in the United States is endemic and unlikely to improve in the near future . The piece rate for tomato picking in Florida is 45-50 cents per bucket , meaning that workers must fill 13 buckets per hour just to make the minimum wage . The lack of a united community also impedes group activism or the formation of statewide grass-roots organizations to demand higher wages and better living and working conditions . Conversely , although lacking strong communal ties , the urban population is already well integrated socially and economically into the international commercial spheres of Miami and Tampa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , the impact of Mexican immigrants is obvious : Their work is at the heart of Florida 's economy . The ultimate socioeconomic adaptation and upward mobility of Mexicans in Florida , however , may lie in the community strength - or lack there-of - of the Mexican population itself . <p> By Jordan Alexandra McDuff <p>
