SO MANY THINGS AT ONCE , like this- : the woman I live with is white , which , I realize , counts as an accomplishment for some people . For me it suggests that they must have been desperate down there , at the church . Someone must have had a vision . And someone else must have decided they needed a delegation . So you see what I mean . None of this makes sense when you tell it straight . I 'm guessing they prayed for a month before reaching the bottom of their barrel ; and then they sent elders up here to my house , scraping and shuffling like a bunch of plantation darkies , asking me what they 've just been asking , blaming it all on Jesus . Maybe the only truth is this one-that I do n't have any idea of what their jumbled lives are like . Maybe somebody really did have a vision . I mean , how desperate do you have to be before you start seeing things ? <p> That 's not cynicism . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos , images coming at you like flashcards . I 'm just tired . And so I see things too . <p> Like it 's been raining all morning . I can see that . There are puddles and rivulets . I can see that too , though now the sun sharpens every detail along our street . Parked cars are shining like new Lego blocks . And the one tree in my yard , a live oak as big as my house , is shimmering with diamonds . I just do n't see the angel . I suppose I could have said Jesus does n't give a shit about the weather and I do n't believe that an angel sent you either ; but that would have hurt their feelings , asked them to step outside their scope of understanding . And God knows we do n't do that . <p> So here we are , the peculiar couple , standing on the porch watching the delegation waddle down my walk like pachyderms . Karen 's holding on her hip a thin black child named Lamont , who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe you could just give it a try . For a few weeks . Until they 've found a new minister . " <p> While I 'm still burning up inside . Trying to sound calm . <p> " Did you ever notice , " I say , " that church committees-black or white , it does n't make any difference-all look like fat , greasy beggars ? Except there 's not a white woman in town as fat as Hula Cole . Did you ever notice that ? " <p> " Quinn , " she says . <p> " You could have dragged those people straight off the streets of Calcutta , added a few tons , and got exactly the same effect . I mean , Jesus Christ , John Powell Baity looks like that fool who played Uncle Remus in the ... " <p> " Quinn , nobody came here to insult you . " <p> " Do n't be so sure . " <p> " I think you would do a wonderful job . " <p> " I like the church the way it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a minister . " <p> " They need a touch of reality . Far as I 'm concerned , that pulpit can <p> stay vacant till they find somebody from the Ku Klux Klan who 'd be <p> willing to take over for a while . What are we doing about dinner ? " <p> " You were n't very polite while they were here . " <p> " Look , polite to these people means yes . And in case you do n't re <p> member , I already have a job . Which is the only reason they showed up <p> here in the first place . " <p> " I do n't think that 's the only reason . " <p> And on and on and on for the next half-hour until she finally smothers the flames . Like she 's walking through the house turning out lights one by one , that kind of woman , who might one day save your life , or drive you insane . So let me tell you again . I 'm not cynical . I 'm just trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about right now is a woman named Karen . Who lives with me . Wears a silver comb in her hair on most days and takes it out at night in a comforting ritual of gray-black strands shaken loose and brushed long . She does it in a way that suggests we are growing old together . And then , as she plucks off silver rings , turquoise bracelets , whatever jangly thing is around her neck , she places them in some solemn order upon her dresser as if praying for grandchildren . So I tease her . Every night . Because that 's the way we say it , by looking together into the same mirror and searching for a silver comb that seems suddenly , inexplicably lost in perfect camouflage . And the long dresses , I think , simply mean that she owns an art gallery , although they still remind me of the year we met . Back then we were a revolution . Now we are only an oddity . And the sweaters ? I do n't know . I suppose she 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No matter what happens in between . <p> You should know that there are crayons scattered over the floor because the porch of my house , which is really a veranda , seems wide and deep enough to look like an invitation to every untethered child in town . There are crayons and piles of paper , chalk and the remnants of someone 's homework . There are two books fluttering like wounded birds . A pair of pink flip-flops . There 's a basketball . A stack of Monopoly money in green , yellow , pink , and white , but no Monopoly board and no Monopoly tokens . Only a lingering argument over the money , is n't that a surprise ? And one of Karen 's hairbrushes and a knotted hairband . But there 's also a momentary calm , broken soon enough by one of the older boys , maybe eight or nine , with a mouth full of sass and that accusatory tone that they use to disguise hope . <p> He starts in on me , just after the damn committee leaves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come you do n't never tell a story ' bout <p> a black man ? " <p> " I do , " I say . " I 've written stories about . . . " <p> But he looks at me like I 'm the white principal . <p> " Look , I already have . Aesop was a black man . So was Lemuel <p> Hawes . Jackie Robinson . So was Abram White . " <p> " How come you do n't tell no stories ' bout a black man living right <p> now ? That ends happy . I ai n't no turtle . " <p> " Hush now . Hush , " says Karen . Patting the big one 's back . Pulling little Lamont into the comfort of her , his legs dangling on either side of her hip . " Hush now . " Then to Lamont , " You 're not hurt anymore . " And her own hair falling loose in places and the full sway of her breasts as she walks among the other children and the dangling jewelry and the smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no idea what their quarrel was about ; and yet she 's there among them , like the shepherd , and I am here on the edge , like the dog , looking for direction . <p> So I adjust my glasses and tug tight the cardigan she gave me for Christmas , the way I do in class when they ask impossible questions . And I put myself where I can look over the heads of the children and down the street , where another , entirely different crowd is gathering , suddenly and inexplicably . It 's like the echo of the turmoil already around us . And I 'm wondering if you understand yet . Because my stomach , already tightening , realizes that there is another story , a real- and urgent one , unfolding farther down the hill , and that I am being drawn into it ata most inconvenient spot . I 'm being pulled in again because one silly , senseless event is always tied to another , that 's what I 've learned . And this new one at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a Sunday afternoon is far more serious than the commotion on my porch . <p> " How come you do n't just make up a story ? " says the same boy . <p> " Listen , " I say . " There 's something happening . " <p> " Quinn ... " Now she 's trying to sound like my wife . " Do you think you ought to go ? " I give her the same glare that the kid gave me . " I just thought you might go look . I mean , if the police ... Maybe you could talk to someone . " <p> " I 'm not the mayor of Coloredtown , " I tell her . " I just live here , same as you . And besides , whatever it is , they do n't want me in the middle of it . " <p> Which is more than enough to send her inside with little Lamont and two of the girls , saying thin-lipped the way she does , " Come along now , " like she thinks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the weekend . Seventeen years , and she still does n't realize I have a history with these people . That I wear cardigan sweaters , for God 's sake , and steel-rimmed glasses . That I teach literature , Karen , the first black man at Baxter College who does n't push or pull something . And so of course they do n't trust me . I do n't even speak their language . I 've grown used to the money . I sit on committees . How can she live with me for seventeen years and not realize ? <p> But here I am , are n't I , on the damp sidewalk , looking back at my empty porch . The children have scattered like biddies , and here I am looking back at a wide , smiling veranda that makes my house look like a plantation house . Rattan chairs big enough for kings . And ferns on either side of the door set like African headdresses on white stands . And a brick walkway that leads up to gray porch steps . So we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made it , after all these years , into the one untroubled crossroads of our town where once , long ago , I sat jamming with a group of musical men who laughed and played half the night . That 's what I 'm mad about . She can slam the damn door all she wants . <p> Because in Baxter who you are determines where you live . And I mean where you sit and stand . Professors in one part of town , businesspeople in another . Black folks over here on the hill . Which is how I 've come to be walking down toward my neighbors , who are gathering around the echoes of gunshots and the sound of a distant siren and now , suddenly , another . Because something has happened again . At first it does n't seem real without television commercials and the cool , flat , flickering images . But here I am walking down my own street beneath the bare , dripping limbs of willow oaks , wiping my glasses with a handkerchief and muttering to myself like a tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live in a hundred-year-old house . As close to the campus as you can get without crossing tracks . <p> So I walk , and it 's like descending into a dream . The Jamaican lawn ornaments , the painted doorways . Like she sent her voice to follow me into dreamland , only an octave higher ; and I know before I look . It 's that boy who ca n't keep himself from beneath my feet or shut his mouth long enough to breathe . Saying , " How come you do n't be the new preacher ? " Just out of reach and as insistent as a mosquito . " You could preach , could n't you ? Ai n't that what you already do ? " <p> " I try not to . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " Why do n't you tell me what your name is . " <p> " I stay with my aunt sometimes , Lamont 's mama . " The infection rising as if this were a question . " I watch him till suppertime most days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , is it ? " <p> " James Lee Kenrick . What you do for money ? " <p> " I teach at the college , James Lee Kenrick. , And besides ... you do n't just wander in off the street and start preaching . Whether there 's a vacancy or not . " <p> " Sometimes you do . I seen it happen . " <p> But I walk ahead of him , down the hill beneath cathedral-columned oaks and into the ruin of our neighborhood where two streets cross . <p> When we reach the edge of the crowd , we stay there , on the margin of a tragedy that 's been gathering for days . I think I can guess , but it takes Silvia to confirm it . She is Lonell 's mother . More police arrive and then an ambulance , and I 'm taken into the swirl of bodies as the crowd gets jostled to one side and then another while yellow crime-scene tape goes up around the tree . Over the ditch . Across the car . Down to the hedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a white cop are working together to push the crowd back . Nightsticks out and up , like this , pushing the people back into the street . But it 's Silvia , not the building chaos around me , that I see with electric clarity , Silvia with wild hair and frantic , flying hands . Two women are trying to hold her up , and several men have come out of the crowd to help her , but she keeps throwing herself to the ground , tearing at the grass , her clothes , and shrieking louder than sirens . Because it 's Lonell in the ditch , under the blue blanket . While I 'm thinking , God , what have we done now ? But of course I already know . <p> I can see them behind me and to my right , three teenagers in warmups , as dignified as old men . Practicing their nonchalance , but managing nevertheless to lurch like vultures until one of them finally breaks a smile . " They put that mug under a blue blanket , man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gon na bury that mu'fucker in it . Serve him right ! " One of them snickering . One of them staring cold hate . <p> On the ground beside the tactful blanket lies a policeman , and another policeman is straddling his chest , pumping with desperate jolts that shake his jowls . A pistol in the grass . Someone 's shoe . And more sirens in the distance . More flashing lights as paramedics arrive for the wounded cop and lift him into the first ambulance without a glance at the crumpled blanket and then try to drive away . Lonell motionless all this time , the fingers of one hand dug into the dirt as if at the moment of death his greatest fear had been falling away from the earth . Some people in the crowd have begun shouting at the outsiders , blocking the path of the ambulance because official Baxter has left behind another black boy , like garbage . Two state patrol cars now , both troopers grim and gray , moving the people out of the street and into adjoining yards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ! " <p> But of course white people did n't kill Lonell Burns . And when I turn and look for James Lee Kenrick I see that he too is gone , lost somewhere in the crowd . <p> It 's a story that 's over before I arrive . A distant horrifying fantasy . Now someone will have to write about it , explain it , translate it . And it 's at this moment that I go sick and drop myself onto Baity 's white brick wall and pansies , because I know who will take it up and what she will say long before she knows herself . One of those reporters , one of those stick-thin girls graduated from the college , maybe one I 've taught myself , as white as desert sand and as breathless and sincere as Jane Austen , and about as prepared for the cough-cough of a Glock 9 mm . Who , sometime this evening , will begin writing about life among the lowly , death in a ditch , for tomorrow 's newspaper . Poor Jane , she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious amazement that we are human beings . As though we were put on this planet to be discovered . And poor us , who will read and watch the television reports not recognizing anyone , least of all ourselves , as the story trickles out <p> So some will rant like the fat girl . And some will scratch our heads . Because the newspaper will say a normally peaceful neighborhood . The tranquility of early evening shattered by gunfire . A troubled teen . The irony that Lonell 's own family called the police , trying to prevent bloodshed . That Officer McLane would be the first to die . <p> Then , on the day after irony , there will appear a second story , with numbers , this one by a feature writer from the city paper twenty-five miles away , who will not add an ounce of understanding . It will say three sisters , one cousin , five rooms , and three generations in a modest dwelling on Mott Street . Ten years of schooling , eight suspensions , and several incidents . A total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , three gold necklaces , and a 9 mm . And taken from Lonell in retaliation : one girlfriend , one child . Then six days between incidents . Three shots fired at Lonell in the drive-by , but no injuries . Seven minutes before Lonell can get his cousin to safety and return home for the gun . Five people who try to restrain him . Two policemen who respond to the call . One can of Mace . One scuffle on the ground . One gathering crowd . One person to reach out of the crowd and pull McLane 's arm away . And a horrible , ironic twist to the plot : three shots by Lonell striking McLane in the neck and face . Then two point-blank shots by the second cop . For a grand total of ninety-seven . <p> It 's how they see the world . <p> Then I will pass the first one on the street , the girl with the sincere pencil , and she will want some words from me , the symbolic spokesman for the tongue-tied class . Because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will fumble for her notebook as I take down my glasses , draw out a handkerchief , and squint . Holding the lenses up to the sun like a boy burning ants , thinking furiously . How can I hate this girl , who is true to her way of knowing , and not hate myself , who could have told a lie nine years ago and prevented myself from observing , " It 's a tragedy . " As I examine her through the one smudged lens and fit the frames back over deaf ears . And hear myself say , " A painful moment for us all . " <p> Still in the muddle of it , I walk back up the hill thinking of Homer . The Greek poet , yes , in this unlikely place . The Homer who could easily have imagined the grim and gratified young men who provoke death , though they could not have imagined him . I 'm trying to remember details , but I suspect Karen has been on the phone already with that circle of women who manage things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man on the front porch with a flashlight . And she 'll be quietly waiting for whatever words I can put . She 'll ask me what happened , meaning something entirely different from the words . And I will say , All those young men , Karen . All those young men , who stab each other at the ships , will come back tomorrow with different names and precisely the same quarrels-you disrespected me , took my woman , walked upon my turf . You touched my golden chain , struck my child . You prey upon my waking thoughts and steal my sleep . I do n't even think they want the monster dead . They want a poet rapping ancient lines , another someone who will translate for them . But right now , as I walk up the long slope , they step out of the early-evening fog and into the place where I imagine them , the dark , moist dreamland where they are <p> ... churning around that ship , Achaeans and Trojans , <p> hacking each other at close range . No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long flights of spears and arrows <p> they stood there man-to-man and matched their fury , <p> killing each other now with hatchets , battle-axes , <p> big swords , two-edged spears , and many a blade , <p> magnificent , heavy-hilted and thonged in black <p> lay strewn on the ground-some dropped from hands , <p> some fell as the fighters ' shoulder straps were cut <p> and the earth ran black with blood . <p> Something I could have taught them . <p> So finally I sag into a kitchen chair , and she reaches across the table to take my hands in hers before drawing away for coffee . Then slides a steaming cup beneath my face . I inhale . It 's like incense wafting across the face of some hollow idol . <p> " What happened ? " is all she can think to say . <p> " What happened ? They do n't even know themselves . " <p> " A drive-by ? " <p> " It does n't make any difference . Next year it 'll be someone else , " I tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody , trying to become a man . Fast or slow , it does n't make any difference . In fact I believe my friend Lonell might have come out a winner , considering that he never had a chance . " <p> " He had a choice . " <p> " White people have a choice . Lonell had the world he lived in . So why do n't you ask me what the rest of them really want to know-where was the boy 's father ? Where was some thick-muscled man to knock him back from the edge ? Where do they all go ? " <p> She looks at me the way she does when we are strangers ; it happens from time to time , though in seventeen years we 've never fought , not once . Never a hateful word between us . People are amazed . We just draw back . She on her side of the track , me on mine , until one of us figures a way across . It 's where we are now . She 's sipping her own coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair back with her fingers . Twirling the ring on her finger . Until finally- " I 've never seen you this down before . You must have known him , known his family . " Her face a perfect oval of concern . <p> I say , " Did you know I grew up in this town ? Played in this very house when I was a boy , because it belonged to my grandmother , Miss Ginny , who built it before there was a track . Whose money sent me up north to school and brought me back here to ... whatever it is . It 's almost beyond comprehension . Did you know my real name was Quinthony ? Not Quentin , but Quinthony . Quinthony Hodges Deagan . It 's one of those black names , like Lakeesha or Gonorrhea Jones . " <p> " Stop it . " <p> My face falls down into my hands , and some low moaning sound comes forth . " We need to quit pretending , you and I. We need to quit pretending that we 're horrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honest , right ? That 's what we have instead of hope . " <p> Then she is there at my shoulders , the hair and the scent of her . Kneading the muscles the way she takes up clay and reaches into the being of it before throwing it on the wheel . " I 'll see you in hell first , " she whispers in my ear . " I 'll drag you back a hundred times . You have no idea how far I 'll go . Now tell me-what really happened ? " <p> And since there are only two of us in a house fit for a family , and since she is strong , I say , " Let me ask you a question . " <p> Suppose you ca n't sleep because you have the same dream every night-that it 's been raining and that there are puddles and rivulets , diamonds and toys scattered about , and the angel Malachi waiting for you at the end of a long walk . And that he is tall and patient . Thin as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see him . You say to yourself , This is a dream , and I am an educated man , and that is just some old fellow who hands out Bibles . One of those homeless who stand outside the gates of the college thrusting little green testaments at anyone who passes , while cars go hissing past-even though his trenchcoat , shiny wet and chitinous , stretched tight against his wings , glistens with liquid light . His hands hooked over a Bible and eyes , yes , burning like brimstone . <p> Until you have to remind yourself that what you 're seeing is not real . <p> But in this particular dream the angel Malachi will be examining several versions of you , because he has eyes like a dragonfly and because one version of you goes blundering through a maze like a blind man . And so he puts himself at a place where your paths converge and says , " This really is n't very complicated . " <p> Of course you misunderstand . You go stiff asa corpse and say , " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up on a man like that . " The angel closes his eyes . Waits . And you stammer on for a step or two , hoping to leave him behind by saying , " Look , pal , I do n't have anything on me . I left my wallet back at the ... I do n't have a nickel . " <p> And the angel says , " It 's not that kind of hunger . " <p> Which provokes some cheap fear from you like , " What do you <p> want ? Just tell me what you want . " <p> And the angel Malachi says , " What do we always want ? " <p> So that 's what I 'm asking you . <p> If you do n't believe in the Walt Disney of it , Karen , then what does he want ? If you ca n't stomach the fried chicken of it , if you ca n't stand in front of them shouting " Thank you , Jesus " for crabgrass and aluminum siding , then what the hell does he want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not after Lonell and the rest of them . <p> On the patio she finds me after two days with that hanging question , and I 'm feeding the books into the fire because I 've finally made the decision they wanted me to make . I 'll give them three weeks . And they 'll probably take everything I own . I believe that 's the usual deal . <p> The fireplace huffs and bellows when the wind whirls , drawing the ashes up like dark confetti , the end of a long process of decomposition . And I 've noticed this . That first a sheet of paper will crumple in upon itself as if crushed by an invisible hand ; and then it will quiver and fall apart , not like rich pine that sizzles in its own juice and then explodes , but like a mummy under eager examination , though of course sometimes they simply smolder , have to be prodded into flame with the poker ; and then there is a rush of fire , thick runnels of red and orange that lick halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . threeinch floaters that can be caught in the palm and read . It 's unbelievable but true . The words are not gone at all . You can still read them . <p> So I burn Bradbury first , that old standby . Then Light in August . Then Tolstoy . Then Milton and Melville together , pages curling like people in pain . It 's surprising really , how much heat there is in old books . I have to wait a moment until I can add Huckleberry Finn . Mary Shelley . Leaves going red and blue at the margins , yellow-orange at the center like the flames themselves . Some of the steel engravings send up a green , leafy blaze , from the chemicals I suppose . And pale , loose pages fly upward , scattering like quail until they burst into a brilliance I 've never seen in the classroom , then spiral down on wings of fire . There 's no denying it 's beautiful . No matter what you feel , there 's no denying the beauty of it . I 'm seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I feel . That 's tomorrow . But right now- . There 's much more heat than we realize . I have to lift my hand momentarily and back away . Then stir the ashes . Then add a thin one , a bright-blue one by Anne Frank . <p> The weight of it is almost too much to bear . <p> Then I sense her beside me , Karen , looking into my mirrored eyes and crying , " Oh my God ! Oh Jesus , not Quinn , what are you doing ? 1 " <p> I have to calm her , of course . I say , " Do n't worry . It runs in my family . We always destroy the evidence . We 've done it for generations . My great-grandfather . My grandmother Miss Ginny . She once burned an entire house and then built a new one , then married a custodian who worked at the college for over . . . " <p> " Quinn , please do n't , please . " <p> " It 's all right , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imagine it , our neighbors . They ca n't even imagine me . They think we 're burning trash . " <p> With her arms around me now . Trying to squeeze the life back into me , work the same silly miracle they want to work when they lift their sons ' shoulders off the sidewalk and feel the warm blood beneath . Birthfluid seeping into the soil while they become oblivious to every other need of the universe . That kind of woman . Who 'll fight right up to the gates of hell . Telling me , and the world , with all her strength . That love is God . <p> I do n't hate the books . I know them as intimately as I know the angry , frightened woman clutching the shawl , who refuses to be warmed - by abstractions . " Listen to me , " she is saying . " You 're not anything until I love you . I do n't understand this , Quinn . You 're brilliant . You 're successful . You 're kind and generous . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years , - or a hundred . I 'm not going to let that go . " <p> " So why ca n't I just be content ? " <p> " No . Why ca n't you realize you 're not responsible for every broken child ? " <p> It takes a while , but finally I tell her , shove aside the cardboard box and sit cradling Ralph Ellison in my hands . <p> " Because I could have saved him . Once upon a time . " " I do n't believe that . " <p> " I knew his mother , Silvia , before I knew you . He must have been five or six when I first met her , a bit older when we drifted apart . " <p> " You do n't have to do this . " <p> " Anyhow , I remember one night , just after there was you , sitting out on that porch and jamming with some of the folks from down the way . It seemed so natural then , simply spreading out over the porch and busting some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes getting blown back by all that sweet sound , just letting the music take us wherever it would . Must have been six or eight of us with old pawned-up instruments we 'd pulled out of the closet . Maybe one or two fellows with some real talent ; but it did n't make any difference . Just some old men with some old songs . James Teague , you know him , sitting on the edge of a rocker blowing trumpet . Some guy named Perry on bass . Harmonica man on the steps , me with that old Gibson thinking I was B. B. King . They had even rolled the piano into the doorway , and I was thinking , man , this is the way it ought to be . <p> " I do n't want to make it out to be something wild . It was n't .

Dressed in a white shirt and Sunday pants like somebody 'd told him it was a church night . Then walking toward me during the rattle and clang of the train . I knew he was Silvia 's boy . And I knew it must have taken everything he had . Waiting for the train to pass , then whispering into the sudden silence , in that accusatory tone they use when there 's still hope , Somebody said you was my daddy .

I love this house . The books . The woman . I 'm just trying to make room . That 's the only story I have to tell . <p> When he was little , Lonell played basketball in my driveway , a loose-packed gravel ramp to nowhere that made it a pass-and-shoot game . Back then it looked like a sharecropper 's field . Your feet went pounding through ruts , crackle and pop , with the ball taking crazy bounces that made little white boys want to cry . They all said it , over and over and over . No blood , no foul . You had to bump and go . You had to turn and shoot into the sun .
