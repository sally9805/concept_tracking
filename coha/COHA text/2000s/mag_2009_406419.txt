EDITED BY DAVID MASELLO SPRINGTIME WEATHER IN PARIS is as unpredictable as the French themselves . When April showers come in May , nothing raises the spirits like a meal in a good Paris bistro . The food is tasty , the portions are generous , and contrary to one 's expectations , the price can be relatively reasonable ( depending on the state of the euro ) and the welcome is friendly . On the dining scene , there has been a rvolution bistronomique , but not all the hyped-up newcomers or revamped old-timers live up to their reputations . From the nouveaux bistros of adventurous young chefs to a classic , here are four of the best . And remember , bistro servings are hearty . Svelte Parisians often opt for two starters or just a main dish . Another tip : share a first course and/or dessert with your dining partner . Prices are for three courses per person .

Basque-accented 1930s patinaed decor with flea-market kitsch and hanging hams , crammed-in tables ( ask for a banquette when you reserve ) and hustle-bustle define this locale as the Real Thing . Despite the two-week wait for a dinner reservation ( lunch is easier ) , French and international gourmets alike continue to flock here . Chef Stphane Jgo 's $43 prix fixe menu and the day 's blackboard specials offer a galette de St. Jacques , a melting mlange of scallops cooked with pied de veau and rosemary ; and tender suckling pig braised with carrots and turnips , served from an iron casserole with a delectable sauce of pan juices . Wines range from a crisp Sauvignon by the glass ( $8 ) to bottles of rare Bordeaux . Photograph : Lunchtime at Chez Georges . With its sleek contemporary feel , white brick walls and dark-timbered accents , Mon Vieil Ami ( la carte , about $50 plus wine ; 69 Rue St.-Louis en l ' le ; 011-33-1-40-46-01-35 ) , the le St.-Louis outpost of Antoine Westermann ( former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated . But the convivial communal table along one wall and chef Frdric Crochet 's interpretations of classics like pot-au-feu and blanquette de veau as $19 lunchtime specials provide the bistro cred . His hachis Parmentier  --  a kind of Gallic shepherd 's pie with fork-tender pot roast and creamy whipped potatoes  --  simply pushed this dish into another stratosphere. la carte delights include a game terrine with cranberries and a green salad , panfried scallops with chestnut cream and trompette mushrooms , and a luscious chocolate tart with sorbet . All can be accompanied by such wines by the glass ( $7 ) as a fruity Pinot Gris from Alsace or a smooth Curton la Perrire Bordeaux . Photograph : Le Petit Pergolse . Off the Avenue Foch in the 16th Arrondissement , Le Petit Pergolse ( la carte , about $63 plus wine ; 38 Rue Pergolse ; 011-33-1-45-00-23-66 ) offers a delicious menu that reflects the Michelin-starred background of owner Albert Corre , who sold his gourmet restaurant to concentrate on his booming bistro . Favorites of the buzzy young regulars here include a lobster salad with truffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calf 's kidneys with Brive mustard , along with desserts like a hot chocolate mousse with vanilla ice cream or a Grand Marnier souffl , accompanied by wine priced from $29 a bottle . The striking black slate tables and lipstick-red leather banquettes reveal Corre 's other passion , contemporary art . The walls are studded with the work of Frank Stella , David LaChapelle , Niki de Saint Phalle and Andy Warhol . Photograph : Rice pudding at Chez l'Ami Jean . Near the Place des Victoires , Chez Georges ( la carte , about $63 plus wine ; 1 Rue du Mail ; 011-33-1-42-60-07-11 ) would be my nomination for World Heritage status if the French plan succeeds to have Gallic gastronomy added to UNESCO listings . The Brouillet family established its first restaurant around the corner in 1909 ; it moved here in 1964 . From the mirrored walls , red leather banquettes and white tablecloths to the soft lighting and white-apron-clad waitresses , nothing has changed in decades . The quality is intact in such legendary fare as the bowl of Baltic herrings served with crme frache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole meunire , which is what you dream of when you think of bistro food ; and the chocolate profiteroles , the best you 'll know . Despite the financial free fall on the nearby stock exchange , the room is crowded with cheerful faces for lunch and dinner . JEAN BOND RAFFERTY
