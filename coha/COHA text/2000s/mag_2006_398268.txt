The effort to restore the Harsh Arabs ' traditional way of life in southern Iraq  --  virtually eradicated by Saddam Hussein-faces new threats <p> THE BRITISH ROYAL AIR FORCE helicopter sweeps low over a sea of marsh grass , then banks sharply to the left , hurling me off my seat and onto the chopper 's rough metal floor . Fifty feet below , pools of silver water speckled with rust-colored flora and lush reed islands in cookie-cutter shapes extend in every direction . Women swathed in black veils and black robes called abayas punt long boats past water buffalo lolling in the mud . Sparkles of light dance off a lagoon , and snowy herons glide over the wetlands . <p> I 'm traveling with a unit of British soldiers deep into Al Hammar Marsh , a 1,100-square-mile freshwater sea located between the southern Iraqi cities of An Nasiriyah and Basra , the country 's second largest after Baghdad . Saddam Hussein 's engineers and soldiers turned it into a desert after the Persian Gulf war of 1991 , but during the past three years  --  thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's orders in the early 1990s  --  the marshlands have been partially rejuvenated . Now this fragile success is facing new onslaughts  --  from economic deprivations to deadly clashes among rival Shiite militias . <p> The Merlin chopper touches down in a muddy field beside a cluster of mud-brick and reed houses . A young Romanian military officer with a white balaclava around his head rushes up to greet us . He 's part of a " force protection " group dispatched from An Nasiriyah in armored personnel carriers to make sure that this British reconnaissance team  --  scouting villages for an upcoming World Environment Day media tour  --  gets a warm reception from the local population . As we climb out of the muck and onto a dirt road , the Merlin flies off to a nearby military base , leaving us in a silence I 've never before experienced in Iraq . A few moments later , two dozen Iraqi men and boys from a nearby village , all dressed in dishdashas  --  gray traditional robes  --  crowd around us . The first words out of their mouths are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Army 's interpreter , hands out bottles of water , a young man shows me a rash on his neck and asks if I have anything for it . " It comes from drinking the water in the marshes , " he tells me . " It is n't clean . " <p> The villagers tell us they have n't seen a helicopter since the spring of 1991 . That was when Saddam sent his gunships into the wetlands to hunt down Shiite rebels and to strafe and bomb the Marsh Arabs who had supported them . " We came back from An Nasiriyah and Basra after the fall of Saddam , because people said it was better to go back to the marshes , " the village chief , Khathem Hashim Habib , says now . A hollow-cheeked chain smoker , Habib claims to be only 31 years old , but he looks 50 , at least . Three years after the village reconstituted itself , he says , there are still no paved roads , no electricity , no schools and no medicine . Mosquitoes swarm at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nearest market for selling fish and water-buffalo cheese , the economic mainstays , is an hour away by truck ; during the rainy months , the Euphrates River rises , washing out the road , swamping the village and marooning everyone in the muck . <p> " We want help from the government , " Habib says , leading us down the road to his home-four sheets of tightly woven reeds stretched over a metal frame . " The officials in Basra and Nasiriyah know that we 're here , but help is n't coming , " he tells a British officer . <p> " We 're here to see exactly what needs to be done , " the officer , fidgeting , assures the chief . " We 'll work with the Basra provincial council , and we 'll make some improvements . " <p> Habib does n't appear convinced . " We have n't seen anything yet , " he calls after the troops as they head down the road to await the Merlin 's return . " So far it 's been just words . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he would prefer going back to live in the cities . He shakes his head no , and his fellow villagers join in . " Life is difficult now , " he tells me , " but at least we have our marshes back . " <p> A COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM created by the annual flooding of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers , Iraq 's marshes have sustained human civilization for more than 5,000 years . Some of the earliest settlements of Mesopotamia  --  " the land between the rivers "  --  were built on floating reed islands in these very wetlands . This was one of the first places where human beings developed agriculture , invented writing and worshiped a pantheon of deities . In more recent times , the remoteness of the region , the near-absence of roads , the difficult terrain and the indifference of Baghdad 's governing authorities insulated the area from the political and military upheavals that buffeted much of the Arab world . In his 1964 classic , The Marsh Arabs , British travel writer Wilfred Thesiger described a timeless environment of " stars reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming home at evening , peace and continuity , the stillness of a world that never knew an engine . " <p> Saddam Hussein changed all that . Construction projects and oilfield development in the 1980s drained much of the wetlands ; the Iran-Iraq War ( 1980-88 ) forced people to flee from border areas to escape mortar and artillery attacks . By 1990 the population had fallen from 400,000 to 250,000 . Then came the gulf war . After the U.S.-led coalition routed Saddam 's army in March 1991 , President George H.W. Bush encouraged the Kurds and Shiites to rebel against Saddam , then , when they did so , declined to support them . Saddam reconstituted his revolutionary guard , sent in helicopter gunships and slaughtered tens of thousands . Shiite rebels fled to the marshes , where they were pursued by tanks and helicopters . Iraqi ground troops torched villages , set fire to reed beds and killed livestock , destroying most of the region 's economic viability . <p> In 1992 , Saddam began the most insidious phase of his anti-Shiite pogroms . Workers from Fallujah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south to construct canals , dams and dikes that blocked the flow of rivers into the marshes . As the wetlands dried up , an estimated 140,000 Marsh Arabs were driven from their homes and forced to resettle in squalid camps . In 1995 , the United Nations cited " indisputable evidence of widespread destruction and human suffering , " while a report by the United Nations Environmental Program in the late 1990s declared that 90 percent of the marshes had been lost in " one of the world 's greatest environmental disasters . " <p> After the overthrow of Saddam in April 2003 , local people began breaching the dikes and dams and blocking the canals that had drained the wetlands . Ole Stokholm Jepsen , a Danish agronomist and senior adviser to the Iraqi Minister of Agriculture , says that " recovery has happened far faster than we ever imagined " ; at least half of the roughly 4,700 square miles of wetland has been reflooded . But that 's not the end of the story . Fed by the annual snowmelt in the mountains of Anatolia , Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biologically diverse , supporting hundreds of varieties of fish , birds , mammals and plant life , including the ubiquitous Phragmites australis , or ordinary marsh reed , which locals use to make everything from houses to fishing nets . But Saddam 's depredations , combined with ongoing dam projects in Turkey , Syria and northern Iraq , have interfered with the natural " pulsing " of floodwaters , complicating restorative processes . " Nature is healing itself , " said Azzam Alwash , a Marsh Arab who immigrated to the United States , returned to Iraq in 2003 and runs the environmental group Nature Iraq , based in Baghdad . " But many forces are still working against it . " <p> I FIRST VISITED the marshes on a clear February day in 2004 . From Baghdad I followed a stretch of the mighty , 1,100-mile-long Tigris River southeast to the predominantly Shiite town of Al Kut , near the Iran border . At Al Kut , I headed southwest away from the Tigris through the desert to An Nasiriyah , which straddles the banks of the 1,730-mile-long Euphrates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Sumerian king in the 21st century B.C. , lies just a few miles west of An Nasiriyah . To the east , the Euphrates enters the Al Hammar Marsh , reappearing north of Basra , where it joins the Tigris . The Bible suggests that Adam and Eve 's Garden of Eden lay at the confluence of the two rivers . Today the spot is marked by a dusty asphalt park , a shrine to Abraham , and a few scraggly date palm trees . <p> I was joined in An Nasiriyah , a destitute city of 360,000 and the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the ongoing war , by a former Shiite guerrilla who uses the name Abu Mohammed . A handsome , broad-shouldered man with a gray-flecked beard , Abu Mohammed fled An Nasiriyah in 1991 and spent five years hiding in the marshes following the rebels ' defeat . In mid-1996 , he and a small cell of Shiite conspirators plotted the assassination of Uday Hussein , Saddam 's psychopathic son . Four of Abu Mohammed 's comrades gunned down Uday  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Republican Guards pursued the conspirators through the marshes , burning rushes and reeds , knocking down eucalyptus forests and bulldozing and torching the huts of any local villagers who provided shelter to the rebels . Abu Mohammed and his comrades fled across the border to Iran . They did n't begin filtering back to Iraq until U.S. forces routed Saddam in April 2003 . <p> After half an hour 's drive east out of An Nasiriyah , through a bleak , pancake-flat landscape of stagnant water , seas of mud , dull-brown cinder-block houses , and minarets , we came to Gurmat Bani Saeed , a ramshackle village at the edge of the marshes . It is here that the Euphrates River divides into the Al Hammar Marsh , and it was here that Saddam Hussein carried out his ambition to destroy Marsh Arab life . His 100-mile-long canal , called the Mother of All Battles River , cut off the Euphrates and deprived the marshes of their prime water source . After its completion in 1993 , " not a single drop of water was allowed to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The entire marsh became a wasteland . " <p> In April 2003 , Ali Shaheen , director of An Nasiriyah 's irrigation department since the late 1990s , cranked open three metal gates and dismantled an earthen dike that diverted the Euphrates into the canal . Water washed across the arid flats , reflooding dozens of square miles in a few days . Almost simultaneously , local people 15 miles north of Basra tore down dikes along a canal at the south end of the marsh , allowing water to flow from the Shatt-al-Arab , the waterway at the entrance to the Persian Gulf . In all , more than 100 dams and embankments were destroyed in those first exhilarating days when everything seemed possible . <p> Abu Mohammed led me down narrow causeways that ran past newly formed seas dappled by mud flats and clumps of golden reeds . Choruses of frogs warbled from lily pad clusters . " This used to be a dry part of the marsh , " he said . " We used to walk over it , but you see it is filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rudimentary security force : rugged-looking men armed with Kalashnikovs , who were both protecting visitors and trying to enforce fatwas issued by the Grand Ayatollah Ali Al Sistani , the preeminent religious leader of Iraq 's Shiite Muslims . With coalition troops stretched thin and no effective police or judicial system in place , the local guardsmen served as the only law and order in the region . One patrol was combing the marshes for fishermen who violated Sistani 's prohibition against " electroshock fishing " : using cables connected to a car battery to electrocute all the fish in a three-foot radius . The prohibited method was threatening the marsh 's resuscitation just as it was getting under way . <p> WHEN I RETURNED to the marshes in May 2006 , southern Iraq , like the rest of the county had become afar more dangerous place . An epidemic of kidnappings and ambush killings of Westerners had made travel on Iraq 's roads highly risky . When I first announced that I hoped to visit the marshes without military protection , as I had done in February 2004 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were crazy . " All it takes is one wrong person to find out that an American is staying unprotected in the marshes , " one Shiite friend told me . " And you may not come out . " <p> So I hooked up with the 51 Squadron RAF Regiment , a parachute- and infantry-trained unit that provides security for Basra 's International Airport . When I arrived at their headquarters at nine o'clock on a May morning , the temperature was already pushing 100 degrees , and two dozen soldiers  --  wearing shoulder patches displaying a black panther , a Saracen sword and the regimental motto , " Swift to Defend "  --  were working up a sweat packing their armored Land Rovers with bottled water . Flight Lt. Nick Beazly , the patrol commander , told me that attacks on the British in Basra had increased the past six months to " once or twice a week , sometimes with a volley of five rockets . " Just the evening before , Jaish al-Mahdi militiamen loyal to renegade Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr , had blown up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two British soldiers on a bridge on Basra 's northern outskirts . Kelly Goodall , the British interpreter who had joined me several days earlier on the helicopter trip to the marshes , had been called away at the last minute to deal with the attack . Her absence left the team with nobody to translate for them  --  or me . Every last local translator , I was told , had resigned during the past two months after getting death threats from Jaish al-Mahdi . <p> We stopped beside a wire-mesh fence that marks the end of the airfield and the beginning of hostile territory . Grim-faced soldiers locked and loaded their weapons . At a bridge over the Shatt al-Basra Canal , the troops dismounted and checked the span and surrounding area for booby traps . Then , just over a rise , the marshes began . Long boats lay moored in the shallows , and water buffalo stood half hidden in the reeds . As we bounced down a dirt road that bordered the vast green sea , the soldiers relaxed ; some removed their helmets and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to do in relatively safe areas . After a 30-minute drive , we reached Al Huwitha , a collection of mud-and-concrete-block houses strung along the road ; a few homes had satellite dishes on their corrugated tin roofs . Children poured out of the houses , greeting us with thumbs up and cries of " OK . " ( The British battle for hearts and minds has actually paid off in Al Huwitha : after the reflooding , troops dumped thousands of tons of earth on waterlogged terrain to raise land levels for housing construction in certain spots , then improved electrification and water purification . " We 're happy with the British , " said one local man . " We have no problems with them , hamdilullah thanks to God . " ) <p> In the center of Al Huwitha rose a large mudheef , a 30-foot-high communal meetinghouse made entirely of reeds , with an elegant curving roof . Some local men invited me inside  --  I was able to talk to them in rudimentary Arabic  --  and I gazed at the interior , which consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tightly woven from reeds , supporting a curved roof . Oriental carpets blanketed the floor , and at the far end , glowing in the soft natural light that seeped in through a doorway , I could make out richly colorful portraits of Imam Ali , son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad , and his son , Imam Hussein , the two martyred saints of Shiite Islam . " We built the mudheef in 2003 , following the old style , " one of the men told me . " If you go back 4,000 years , you will find exactly the same design . " <p> Al Huwitha 's biggest problem stems from an unresolved tribal feud that goes back 15 years . The people of the village belong to a tribe that sheltered and fed the Shiite rebels just after the gulf war . In the summer of 1991 , some 2,500 members of a rival tribe from Basra and wetlands to the north showed Saddam 's Republican Guards where the Al Huwitha men were hiding . The Guards killed many of them , a British intelligence officer told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two groups ever since . " Al Huwitha 's men ca n't even move down the road toward Basra for fear of the enemy group , " the officer went on . " Their women and children are allowed to pass to sell fish , buffalo cheese , and milk in Basra markets . But the men have been stuck in their village for years . " In 2005 , a furious battle between the two tribes erupted over a love affair  --  " a Romeo and Juliet story , " the officer added . The fighting lasted for days , with both sides firing rocket-propelled grenades , mortars and heavy machine guns at each other . The officer asked the sheik of Al Huwitha " if there was any chance of a truce , and he said , ' This truce will happen only when one side or the other side is dead In June Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki declared a state of emergency and sent several thousand troops to the area to restore order . In August supporters of an assassinated Shiite tribal leader lobbed mortar rounds at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand that he arrest their leader 's killers . <p> DRIVING BACK TOWARD BASRA , we passed a settlement being built on a patch of wasteland within sight of the airport 's control tower . The settlers , Marsh Arabs all , had abandoned their wetlands homes two months earlier and were constructing squat , ugly houses out of concrete blocks and corrugated tin . According to my British escorts , the part of the marshes where they had lived is owned by sayeds , descendants of the prophet Muhammad , who forbade them from building " permanent structures , " only traditional reed houses . This was unacceptable , and several hundred Marsh Arabs had picked up and moved to this bone-dry patch . It is a sign of the times : despite reconstruction of a few mudheefs , and some Marsh Arabs who say they would like to return to the old ways , the halcyon portrait of Marsh Arab life drawn by Wilfred Thesiger half a century ago has probably disappeared forever . The British officer told me he had asked the settlers why they did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They all say they do n't want it , " the officer said . " They want sophistication . They want to join the world . " Ole Stokholm Jepsen , the Danish agronomist advising the Iraqis , agreed . " We will have to accept that the Marsh Arabs want to live with modern facilities and do business . This is the reality . " <p> Another reality is that the marshes will almost certainly never recover completely In earlier times , the Tigris and Euphrates , overflowing with snowmelt from the Turkish mountains , spilled over their banks with seasonal regularity . The floods flushed out the brackish water and rejuvenated the environment . " The timing of the flooding is vital to the health of the marshes , " says Azzam Alwash . " You need fresh water flowing in when the fishes are spawning , the birds are migrating , the reeds are coming out of their winter dormancy . It creates a symphony of biodiversity . " <p> But these days , the symphony has dwindled to a few discordant notes . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 hydroelectric power plants on the Euphrates and Tigris and their tributaries , siphoning off water before it ever crosses Iraq 's northern border . Before 1990 , Iraq got more than three trillion cubic feet of water a year ; today it 's less than two trillion . The Central and Hammar marshes , which are dependent upon the heavily dammed Euphrates , get only 350 billion cubic feet  --  down from 1.4 trillion a generation ago . As a result , only 9 percent of Al Hammar and 18 percent of the Central Marsh have been replenished , says Samira Abed , secretary general of the Center for Restoration of the Iraqi Marshes , a division of Iraq 's Water Resources Ministry . " They are both still in a very poor state . " ( The Al Hawizeh Marsh , which extends to Iran and receives its water from the Tigris , has recovered 90 percent of its pre-1980 area . ) <p> Linda Allen , an American who serves as senior consultant to the Iraqi Ministry of Water , told me that getting more water from Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to strike a deal , " there is no formal agreement about the allocation and use of the Tigris and Euphrates . " Iraq and Turkey stopped meeting in 1992 . They met once earlier this year , but meanwhile the Turks are building more upstream dams . <p> Azzam Alwash believes that intransigence on both sides dooms any negotiations . His group , Nature Iraq , is promoting an alternative that , he claims , could restore the marshes to something like full health with three billion cubic meters of additional water per year . The group calls for constructing movable gates on Euphrates and Tigris tributaries to create an " artificial pulse " of floodwater . In late winter , when Iraq 's reservoirs are allowed to flow into the Persian Gulf in anticipation of the annual snowmelt , gates at the far end of the Central and Al Hammar marshes would slam shut , trapping the water and rejuvenating a wide area . After two months , the gates would reopen . Though the plan would not exactly replicate the natural ebb and flow of floodwaters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alwash says , " we can recover 75 percent of the marshes . " He says that the Iraqi government will need between $75 million and $100 million to build the gates . " We can do this , " he adds . " Bringing back the marshes is hugely symbolic , and the Iraqis recognize that . " <p> For the moment , however , Alwash and other marshlands environmentalists are setting their sights lower . In the past three years , Nature Iraq has spent $12 million in Italian and Canadian government funds to monitor salinity levels of marsh water and to compare " robust recovery " areas with those in which fish and vegetation have not thrived . Jepsen , working with the Iraqi Agriculture Ministry , is running fisheries , water-buffalo breeding programs and water-purification schemes : both agriculture and water quality , he says , have improved since Saddam fell . In addition , he says , the " maximum temperatures during the summer have been significantly reduced " across Basra Province . <p> Sitting in his office in Saddam 's former Basra palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq wistfully . In those days , he says , he could climb into his four-by-four and venture deep into the marshes with only an interpreter , observing the recovery without fear . " During the last six months , the work has grown extremely difficult , " he says . " I travel only with the military or a personal security detail . I am not here to run a risk on my life . " He says discontent among the Marsh Arabs is also rising : " In the days after reflooding , they were so happy . But that euphoria has worn off . They are demanding improvements in their lives ; the government will have to meet that challenge . " <p> In the marshlands , as in so much of this tortured , violent country , liberation proved to be the easy part . <p> MAP : BASRA <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Al Hammar Harsh is a 1,100-square-mile freshwater sea between the southern Iraqi cities of An Nasiriyah and Basra .
