1 <br> ... all you can do is mop up the aftermath , dump it in a giant personal hazmat container and move on . <p> I shoulda known better . But I guess life would be boring if we had all the answers . How about half the answers ? Maybe that would have kept my butt out of the gigantic sling it ended up in . <p> Who am I kidding ? No , it would n't . Anyway , until the day after my daughter 's wedding  --  and all that champagne  --  I really thought I had a handle on my life . Then it broke off . <p> But if you ca n't drink champagne at your daughter 's wedding , when can you ? Amber 's wedding  --  it 's been two years and it still seems impossible she could be married . My little girl looked so beautiful I had to pinch myself to keep from boohooing . That day she and J.J.  --  Baby Son-in-Law I call him , because he still has a face like his fourth-grade picture  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put up with each other 's mess . Then she was n't my little girl anymore . She was J.J. 's wife . My own vows did n't hit me that hard . <p> In the limo after the ceremony I popped the cork on one of those cute little champagne splits to calm my nerves . Not that I was nervous like test-taking nervous , but your only daughter 's wedding does fall into the major life-change category  --  those events that give us gray hair and stress us out , like moving , losing your job , grinning and bearing it while dealing with your ex-husband and his wannabe diva girlfriend for three whole days without slapping either one of them . Besides , I knew the bubbly would help me smile through all the picture taking even though my feet sizzled like raw meat on a hot grill , thanks to those very cute , very high shoes Amber talked me into because they looked so sassy with my lilac dupioni silk suit . And I looked damn good , thank you very much . Better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let 's not even discuss that woman Amber 's father paraded around . I mean , who wears a miniskirt and thigh boots to a wedding ? Do n't take my word . Check out the video . I looked great  --  way too young to be the mother of the bride . Except for that corsage . <p> I hate corsages . They 're for old ladies who wear mink stoles and musty dusting powder . That will not be me . Ever . The last thing I needed was a big , sloppy orchid planted over my double Ds . Why do you think I wear this minimizer harness ? But Amber just about had an ing-bing at the florist 's  --  you know , one of those fits like she used to pitch when she was two and she did n't approve of my day-care wardrobe selection . Ever try explaining to a two-year-old that the pink flowered pants are in the dirty clothes and she should be thankful she has something clean to wear , since Mommy has been featuring the same tired black skirt every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit the Laundromat by the weekend because the check for the used-car-dealer jingle Daddy wrote is still " in the mail " ? And that she needs to get her skinny behind dressed , since Mommy is ready to scream because she does n't want to be late for work again ? You ca n't . So somehow I 'd manage to tease , trick or threaten her into her clothes and I 'd wash out the pink pants that night by hand , which pretty much guaranteed the next day she wanted to wear her jeans with the stars embroidered on the back pockets . We sure came a long way from those days . <p> So I wore the corsage , because Amber has always had first-class taste , thanks in no small part to good home training , because I love her more than anybody in the world , and because arguing with my daughter can be like convincing a pit bull to let go of your leg  --  which is n't a bad quality . Early on I made sure she learned how to stick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , their wedding . <p> It 's just that I was n't ready for anybody 's wedding . Oh , I was used to the two of them hanging around the house , from the time they were in high school , and all through college , listening to the stereo , watching TV , playing games on the computer . By the time they were in tenth grade , he 'd dropped the " Mrs. Hodges , " and since he had sense enough to know not to call me Thomasina , he invented his own name for me . " Yo , Mama Tee , what 's for dinner ? " He 'd ask this while taking inventory in my refrigerator , just as big and bold . " Did you ask your mother ? " I 'd say , but by then he 'd be setting the table  --  placemats , silverware , napkin folded just so . He was always sweet , and I figured he 'd be around until Amber chewed him up and was ready for the next flavor . Shows you what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has n't chewed the sweet out of him yet . <p> Anyway , in the fall after they had both graduated and found their first jobs , I was up early one Saturday , getting ready to go get my hair done , and the doorbell rang . Amber came flying downstairs , wearing the white blouse , tweed skirt and black leather Minnie Mouse pumps she 'd put on when she was trying to look sophisticated . I knew something was brewing , since it was only a little later than the time she usually got home from Friday night . Before I could say anything , she yanked open the door and J.J. strolled in wearing a navy blue suit . A suit ? On a Saturday morning ? It made me dizzy . J.J. kissed her , handed me a box of still-warm doughnuts and a bouquet of red and white carnations wrapped in that shiny green tissue paper . That 's when my knees went to Jell-O and I almost missed the seat of my chair as I sat down . The two of them plopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's wrong ? " I said , which I know is not what you 're supposed to say when somebody gives you flowers and doughnuts , but it 's all I could think of . The next thing I knew , he was down on one knee , holding a black velvet box . " Oh no , " is what came out of my mouth , which was n't exactly what I meant , but really , it was . I dropped the flowers all over the floor . J.J. swiped at a tear on his cheek after he slid the twinkling half-carat diamond on Amber 's finger . " Look at it , Mama ! " Her hand was shaking when she showed it to me . Then she finally remembered to say , " Yes . " And I ate six doughnuts  --  I do n't know what flavors  --  then went to the hairdresser , because what else was there for me to do ? <p> Later , when Amber and I were alone and I could speak in complete sentences , I sat next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I wanted to examine the ring , but I covered it with my other hand . " You two are so young to get married . You just graduated from college . Your whole life is ahead of you . " I must have read that in The Fools ' Guide to Motherhood , because those words never came out of my mother 's mouth . <p> " Not as young as you and Daddy , " she informed me and snatched back her hand . <p> So I pointed out the obvious . " You see how well that worked out . " But the " case closed " look had come over her , like when she just had to have the Chinese symbol for luck tattooed on her left thigh for her eighteenth birthday . I said , " To my knowledge no one in our family is Chinese , " and she informed me she was eighteen , she could vote , so she could decide what to do with her body . I said , " We used to be able to drink at eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ultimately I let it go . Her left thigh was her business , and I guess getting married would have to be too . After all , J.J. had an education and a job . He had a good head on his shoulders and to the best of my knowledge , he was n't a drug addict or a serial killer  --  these days you never know  --  so the rest was on her . One of the great jokes of life is that by the time you 're old enough to recognize how little you know , all you can do is mop up the aftermath , dump it in a giant personal hazmat container and move on . <p> Next thing I knew , I was up to my eyelids in bridal magazines and sample menus . I had no idea there were so many banquet halls and bridal shops within a fifty-mile radius of home . Or that there would be so many decisions to make  --  calligraphied envelopes for the invitations or Mom 's lovely penmanship ? Edible , potable or savable favors ? Tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-town guests ? Rehearsal dinner , breakfast the day after or both ? Or that it could possibly cost that much to get married . But it sure was fun , and it turned out just like Amber and I planned  --  picture perfect . I mean , J.J. 's parents are lovely people , but their idea of decoration was crepe-paper streamers and balloons , and my daughter 's wedding was not going to be that kind of affair . Besides , his father had gotten transferred to Dallas a few years back , so it 's not like they could keep up with all the details . I acquired some shiny new platinum plastic , with a limit high enough to pay for a very nice car , in order to sponsor the occasion . It would be the only bill in my long history of bill paying that would make me smile every month when I wrote the check . Is n't that why I went to work every day ? So I could afford the nicer things in life ? Anyway , whatever it cost to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Except it made me remember how happy her father and I looked that Friday we ran off to city hall , all hope and expectation . <p> I had shed my usual stonewashed Jordache for a green silk dress with bat-wing sleeves and shoulder pads the size of throw pillows and pulled my hair into a Jheri-curl ponytail with a big black clip-on bow . He had hair back then , long as mine , and it was cut in an Afro shag that bobbed when he played keyboard . Folks used to say he looked halfway like O.J. , back when that was cute . He had rolled up the sleeves on his rented tuxedo and wore the ruffled shirt open so you could see his gold chains and the curly hair on his chest . Mercifully , there are no pictures , but we had it all figured out . He was the music man  --  the next Stevie Wonder . And I would be right by his side  --  his fan , his muse , his manager . We were gon na light everybody 's fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love can make you a first-class fool . <p> But none of that mattered on Amber 's wedding day . It was the most perfect October day I ever hope to see . We had made it through corsets , crinolines , upsweeps and the first big crisis of the day when they sent the white stretch limo instead of the white superstretch SUV I paid for . Amber got on the phone , turned into the Bride of Frankenstein , and thirty minutes later we had the right car . <p> By the time we arrived , the church was full . The bridesmaids arranged themselves in their six degrees of purple gowns . Dad , looking very dapper in his first-ever purchased tuxedo , was about to walk Mom , elegant in amethyst , to their seats when she reached up , patted my cheek and said , " You know , Tootsie , you 're getting old . " That 's what I love about my mother . She captures those sentiments you wo n't find on a Hallmark card . After that , I gave Amber a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like I was losing my last friend , which is kind of how it felt . Anyway , I snapped out of it when she took her father 's arm , because that made me mad . Why should he get to give away somebody I raised ? But she wanted it that way , so before I got madder , I let the best man , Baby Son-in-Law 's cousin Ron , escort me down the aisle . I squeezed his arm so tight I probably stopped the poor man 's circulation , but he winked and smiled and whispered , " It 'll be fine . " And for some reason , I believed him . So I vaguely remember grinning as we marched in , but really I could n't feel my face , or my feet touch the floor , because I could n't figure out how twenty-one years had gone by , and my child  --  the one I grunted and pushed to deliver without the benefit of drugs so I remember every blasted , blessed moment  --  could possibly , legally , be getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job just did n't know what to say . I could n't wait for them to spread the word on Monday  --  tell the others how together Tee was . You know , some people think we do n't have anything or know the proper way things are done . I wanted them to see that Thomasina Hodges was  --  and always would be  --  a class act , especially that snake in suede loafers . He sent regrets , but his assistant showed up and fell all over herself telling me how fabulous the wedding was . So I smiled , said my " thank yous " graciously , had another sip of champagne and watched as she took one more California roll from the passing tray . After that , Julie , who had been the receptionist on executive row , and the only other brown face , came up and said , " I do n't know how you can look so calm . " I told her sometimes the commercials get it right . Never let ' em see you sweat . We clinked our glasses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my next post receiving-line meet and greet . <p> My best buds from the neighborhood  --  Diane , Marie , Cecily and Joyce  --  our kids had been in school together  --  nodded their collective approval and congratulated me on throwing a stellar wedding . We called ourselves the " Live Five " and we toasted to my good taste . Twice . <p> Then I had to get through the first dance , and the song Amber 's father wrote especially for her . All that ooohing and aaahing about how sweet it was just pissed me off because he always did know how to upstage me . I pay for the whole soiree , but he gets over with a song . OK , he offered to chip in on the wedding . I just could n't bring myself to accept . I mean , he was n't a deadbeat dad  --  just a deadbeat husband . I never had to hunt him down or get the states of California and New York involved in making him cough up child support . Sure , in the beginning he almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of change away , and his monthly contributions barely kept Amber in juice boxes and sneakers , but it came regular as the IRT , which is to say sometimes it was late , but it always arrived eventually . After he finally started making some money as a musician , he 'd take Amber with him during the summers when he toured  --  Budapest , Sydney , Johannesburg ... And even though food on the table and new school clothes every fall does n't leave quite the same impression as your very own frequent-flyer miles , a visit to the cockpit , getting pinned with your very own wings ( which my darling child wore every day for six months ) or seeing a kangaroo in its native habitat  --  at least the man was present in her life . But tattoo and all , Amber had been a great kid  --  not a nickel 's worth of trouble  --  as long as I do n't count her adoration of her father . So her wedding  --  exactly the way she always dreamed about  --  I wanted to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't you know it ? After his serenade , Dear Old Dad presented the happy couple with a big fat check toward the down payment on a house  --  guess he must 've sold a couple of songs  --  finally . That brought the room to its feet . Terrific . OK . I guess it was n't like we hated each other . But it did n't take long after we parted ways for the reasons we got together in the first place to seem like they had been written in the sand . I guess we both loved each other once upon a time  --  that was a whole ' nuther happily ever after . The only thing we still had in common was that we both loved Amber , so we agreed to be civilized about our daughter and not to bad-mouth each other in front of her , and after I made it clear that as far as I was concerned it was not then , nor would it ever be , OK for him to have put his dreams first and his family somewhere farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince me we could be friends . So the good thing about him singing was that I did n't have to dance with him , because I do n't know if I could have managed to glide across the floor , like when we used to do the Hustle  --  <p>  --  so I sucked down another glass of champagne , kept my mother-of-the-bride smile firmly in place and watched from the sidelines . And even though I thought I was doing a pretty good job , my bad attitude must have been showing just a little , because both my mother and Julie came over to ask if I was OK  --  I assured them I was . <p> The maetre d ' kept my glass full . Frankly , he was supposed to . As much money as I laid out  --  including the coconut shrimp and mini lamb chops during the cocktail hour , beef Wellington and sea bass for dinner and the Viennese table with the chocolate fountain  --  he should have been at the door of my complimentary suite with a rose and a mimosa the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that woulda killed me for sure . <p> Anyway , my problems started the next day when I woke up , and shoulda , coulda and woulda did not stop the train wreck in my head , or keep the elephant from tap dancing across my aching body . I mean , I 'd probably had more to drink in one night than I had consumed in the last decade . My mouth felt like I 'd been sucking vintage sewer water and I wanted to call room service or 911 for an Advil and orange juice IV because I could not remember where the bathroom was or imagine dragging myself to it and trying to find the pill bottle in my toiletry bag . That would have meant I had to open my eyes . I had tried that already . The little bit of light sneaking through the drapes made me want to vomit . <p> Then he coughed . And my heart about exploded out of my chest because I did n't know he was there . Or who he was . <p> I jumped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull , and as I caught sight of those high heels , my suit and new purple lace bra and panties in a heap on the floor , I came to the horrifying realization that my lumpy brown body was bare-butt naked . So I snatched the spongy beige blanket off the king-sized bed , uncovering a king-sized man , and I suddenly realized HE was J.J. 's cousin Ron , the best man . And I thought , Oh my Lord , what else do n't I remember ? <p> " I did n't expect to hear from you before noon . " He rolled up on his elbow and did n't seem the slightest bit surprised to be where he was . Or to be skin-side up . <p> Then he smiled that killer smile , the one I had been avoiding since he showed up at the wedding rehearsal and J.J. introduced him and I thought , That 's cousin Ron ? The one who was like a second father to J.J. ? Second fathers are not supposed to have bulging biceps or voices like hot buttered rum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cheek before depositing me at my designated pew . I sat there , doing my best to look motherly and not think about how good he smelled and how good those lips felt on my cheek . <p> Ron was pretty popular with the ladies at the reception too  --  I saw more than one of the bridesmaids giggle at something he said , then bat her eyelashes as he obligingly twirled them around the dance floor . I swear I even saw my mother grin at him when he stopped by their table to chat  --  not that I was paying attention or anything . And when the time came , he gave such a beautiful toast about how he 'd watched Amber and J.J. learn to love each other , from puppy love to grown-up love . How attending the wedding meant we would all be there to help them love each other for many years to come . And he was right . I had seen it , in my own living room . I glanced over at Mama and Daddy , who had finally left Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so worried when Amber and I set out on our own , but I showed them I could take care of her and I could throw this wedding without anybody 's help , thank you very much . Mom said I was crazy  --  " It 's a wedding , not a coronation "  --  but they sat there just beaming . That filled me up too . I had a little speech planned , except there really was n't anything left to say and I had no voice to say it with . So I clinked my glass , toasted to their future and washed down the disappointments of my past . Because suddenly , in the midst of a sit-down dinner for 220 people , I felt totally alone . I mean , I had my daughter to love , J.J. too , and my family , but who did I have , for me  --  personally ? <p> Could I say I loved Gerald ? <p> Of course , I did . In my way . He was the one and only man in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , not exactly together . You ca n't exactly be together with a man who has a wife and three kids  --  they 're not even kids anymore . Yeah , I know that sounds bad , but I did n't think of it like that . We never talked about Annie ; in fact , the only thing I knew about her was her name . I heard about his children growing up . He heard about Amber . The time flew by . We shared some pretty significant moments along the way . I guess you could say we reached an understanding . We could be together on my birthday , unless there was a recital or a ball game , but not his . Major holidays were out , but that left a whole lot of evenings , the occasional Saturday , whenever our calendars coincided . I was n't staying home waiting by the telephone . He did n't have to lie to me . I did n't have stray socks on my floor , fuzz in my sink , toilet seats left up , anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my money and my time or expectations that would never be fulfilled . <p> Amber and I had also reached a kind of understanding about me and Gerald . Back when she was thirteen , she came home early from a sleepover  --  flew up the stairs , barged into my room to tell me all about the party and found him there . No , she did n't catch us doing anything , but it sure was n't what she expected from dear old Mom . After that , they 'd run into each other from time to time  --  until the day Amber and I saw Gerald in the mall with his family . I tried to act like I did n't see him and dragged Amber into a sporting-goods store , praying she did n't see him either . But before I could even pretend I was seriously interested in the teepee of aluminum baseball bats , she was in my face . " Was n't that your friend ? Who was that with him ? " It was a game of Twenty Questions I 'd rather not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers . Anyway , our discussion progressed into a screaming match in the car that I , not so proudly , ended with " because I 'm grown and as long as you live in my house and I pay your bills , what I say goes . " <p> Gerald was not at the wedding . <p> But Ron was , and now he was pointing in my direction , if you get my drift . And he had to go . " You have to go , " I said . It came out somewhere between a shriek and a question . Then I got this flash that my hair must be smushed to the side of my head , so I kind of ran my fingers through it , casually , and wrapped the blanket around me like a super-sized tortilla . <p> " Do n't cover up . " He patted the bed . " Come on and relax . We can order in some breakfast , take a shower . And later I 'll help you get those presents into your car . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bridal party cavalcade carrying them to the suite . Ron came last  --  carrying a silver-wrapped box that felt like his and hers barbells . I think the others were gone . I hope the others were gone . I prayed the others were gone . I remembered looking at all those beautiful boxes and starting to cry , because the day had been overwhelming  --  the whole week , really . Ron surrounded me in a hug and I remembered that it felt so good . And then I was standing in the middle of the floor , in my tortilla , crying again , which made it worse , because I do not cry . I 'd rather shoot staples under my fingernails than snivel and whine . But there I was , sniveling like a champ , and I could n't stop . " Please do n't tell anybody . " I was begging . " I 'm so embarrassed . " It was pathetic . I was pathetic . A spectacle . I was just grateful there was no mirror where I could see myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me some tissues . " No need to be embarrassed . " <p> That made me snort . " Oh , of course not , " I said . " The mother of the bride traditionally sleeps with the best man . " <p> Which made him laugh . Me too , for a moment . I wiped my face and tried to get my head together . <p> " We 're all single adults here . " Ron folded me in his arms again . Those arms  --  against that strong chest , which , I realized to my horror , now smelled more like my perfume than his aftershave . How much had I rubbed up against him ? Could n't the floor just open up and swallow me ? But I was n't getting off that easy . He kissed my eyelids and said , " Last night was great . And once you get to know me , you 'll realize I would never disrespect you in any way . " <p> Get to know him ? Was he crazy ? And what exactly had made last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yanked myself out of his arms , kind of like a fly coming to its buzzing senses just before the Venus flytrap clamps shut . The fact that I slept with a man I had known for all of two days was already too much for me to process . Now he thought I was ready to exchange vital statistics ? I had n't found myself in bed with anybody but Gerald in twelve years , and I can count on one hand with fingers left over the times we woke up together . And when was the last time he told me it was great ? On top of that , I did n't even know how old Ron was  --  somewhere north of J.J. , but definitely south of me . And he was J.J. 's cousin and godfather . End of story . It was going to be hard enough trying to pretend this never happened when we both showed up at christenings , Thanksgiving dinners and other family get togethers . <p> I guess Ron read the near-hysteria on my face because then he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I babbled something that ended in yes , then headed for the bathroom , dragging my blanket behind me , because at that moment the suite felt very small and I did not want to see whether he was annoyed or relieved . <p> I took a long shower by the red glow of the heat lamp , letting the water rush over me , even my hair . I 'd figure out what to do with my wet naps later . Clearly , I had stepped over some invisible boundary and needed to wash myself back to the other side of the line , where I belonged . I closed my eyes , let the water stream over my head , my neck , my shoulders , my back . I tried to let my mind go blank , but scenes from the day before popped in and out of my head like a slide show  --  Amber and J.J. scouring each other 's faces in wedding cake , me floating down the aisle on Ron 's arm , the Olympian prowess of the single women leaping and diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and J.J. left for their bridal suite at another hotel . She thanked me for being her mom , every day . Not just on special occasions , but during bad dreams , scraped knees , report cards  --  good and bad  --  acne breakouts and tattoos . She said she hoped one day she could be as good a mother to her children . Well , remembering that only prompted more waterworks . Somehow tears feel different from shower water , and the hot drops traced down my face , but enough was enough . I blew my nose in my washcloth and felt around for the soap . <p> When I got down to my feet there was a tender spot on my baby toe and I knew it was a blister from all that dancing . The Hustle , the Electric Slide , the Booty Call  --  ironic , huh ? I had n't grooved like that in years . My dad even took me for a turn around the floor , calling himself waltzing . And I danced with Ron , at least I remembered that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow dance , but it was one of those sneaky ones where the band starts off with some boogie music , then slides into a slow jam before you have a chance to make a graceful exit . Next thing I knew , I was cheek to cheek , smelling that good cologne . It did n't hurt that I caught my ex 's eye . That made me snuggle a little closer , and you can see where that got me . You know as well as I do there 's no fool like an old fool . <p> Then the lightning hit me right between the eyes and I dropped the soap . What did I drum into Amber 's head whenever we talked about sex ? Not the " sperm and egg , is n't it a miracle ? " talk when she was young . But later , when boys ' names started creeping into her conversation and one of her little girlfriends turned up pregnant . Yes , I did everything short of beg and bribe her to wait until she got older , which led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the car , which is where I usually arranged these intimate tOte-a-tOtes so she could n't escape . I also told her that if ever , whenever  --  I could barely say the words , but I made myself clear . She had to promise me to use a condom . " I do n't care where he tells you it has n't been or how much he says he loves you  --  no latex , no sex . " That was n't just for Amber . Even after all these years , Gerald had to live with that rule too . But I had no idea exactly what we did last night , much less what we used , which only compounded my complete mortification . <p> I did n't even dry off . I snatched the terrycloth robe from behind the door , kicked the blanket out of my way and charged out of the bathroom . How in the world was I going to ask him if he had put a sock on it ? <p> But Ron was gone . Damn . Just like he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned on the lights and got on my hands and knees . Crawling around on the carpet like an insane crab , I found an earring back , somebody 's long dried-up contact lens and a three of clubs , but not that little square wrapper . The panic was rising as I tore the sheets off the bed , but still nothing and I could n't tell if I was shower wet or if I 'd worked up a sweat . I wanted to scream , but the last thing I needed was hotel management showing up at the door . " Oh , I 'm sorry . I was just looking for a used rubber . Do you think you could help me ? " There is no tip big enough for that . So I sat on the bed for a second to collect what was left of my wits . That 's when I saw his business card on the night stand . Ron owned an auto body shop . I do n't know what I thought he did , but it was n't that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever seen . Anyway , he had written his cell number on the back , so I could have called him to ask , as casually as I could , if either of us had had the good sense to make at least one smart decision that night , but I was sure he already thought Amber 's mother was crazy . A conversation about whether he 'd used a raincoat was more humiliation than I could handle . So I took one last sweep of the suite  --  felt under sofa cushions , moved the coffee table . I was digging around in the trash can with the hotel ballpoint and bingo ! Securely wrapped in layers of tissue was the evidence I needed . Hallelujah ! <p> Then I was completely through . I called for a pot of coffee and started throwing clothes , lilac suit and all , in my bag because I had to go home . And there was not one doubt in my stressed-out , hungover mind that none of this foolishness would have happened if I had n't lost my job the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant <br> Continues ...
