TALES ABOUT THE HIRING , PROMOTION , and retention of female faculty abound in academia . Most point to individual successes in the wake of affirmative action but also highlight how much remains to be done . The report first published in the March 1999 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Faculty Newsletter has become legendary in this regard . Despite clear attempts over a decade to further the careers of women , the situation of women at the MIT had not significantly improved . <p> Given the tiny number of women faculty and the fact that they are essentially irreplaceable , one would have assumed that all tenured women would be treated exceptionally well-pampered , overpaid , indulged . Instead , they proved to be underpaid , to have unequal access to the resources of MIT , to be excluded from any substantive power within the University. ( n1 ) <p> The MIT report concluded that the campus was slow to recognize other , more subtle forms of discrimination : " it did not look like what we thought discrimination looked like . " ( n2 ) <p> Figuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge , as women in science at the University of Texas at Austin discovered when they asked about sex equity on our campus . Campus leadership had recognized that sex equity in employment had not been achieved ; therefore it sought to identify what might help the situation for female faculty in moving further toward the goal of parity in compensation . <p> In those discussions , a traditional tool , statistics , emerged as crucial in making a forceful case for continuing interrogations of the situation of female faculty . In what follows , we will show how a typical body of statistical data on the salary and rank of female faculty can be displayed to speak more clearly to a general audience , transforming a discussion about status into a considerably more compelling representation of trends in sex equity in faculty employment . The new strategy for data presentation to be addressed below emerged as critical in a series of discussions with deans about the status of women , because it showed in graphic form hitherto unrecognized trends and , equally important , gave previously recognized realities new clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at stake in using such a tool is attention getting : letting those in power ( administrations , legislatures ) see that problems still exist , so that they can be brought to react and to understand the urgency that individual faculty women sense in their careers . " Reanalyzing the data , " " running the numbers , " is a traditional tool ; in this case , regraphing and establishing trend lines for female salaries allowed us to see a new version of what can and can not be ascertained from standard data . The data are not , however , self-evident and need to be made more compelling-regraphing can make an effect . We want to recommend the tactic by showing how it can be used . <p> COMPILING AND ANALYZING THE DATA <p> In the 1999-2000 academic year , Shelley M. Payne ( Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology ) and Linda E. Reichl ( Department of Physics ) , with the support of the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost ( EVPP ) and especially Vice-Provost Lucia A. Gilbert , led an initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty at the University of Texas at Austin . Those data were posted in fall 2000 as an extensive set of graphs , tables , and accompanying commentary analyzing percentages of women faculty , their salaries , and their representation within their academic fields on the campus ) . ( n3 ) <p> The raw salary data collected by the Office of Institutional Studies and available to the Office of the EVPP ( and , in large part , public record ) included the rank , departmental affiliation , and salary of every tenured and tenure-track faculty member . To address the specific question of sex equity , a team headed by Payne calculated the number of faculty members of each rank and sex in each department . It assigned each faculty member to one of five ranks : assistant professor , associate professor , full professor , holder of a named professorship , or holder of a named chair . An average salary was calculated for each sex of each rank in each department . The team also calculated the percentages of female and male graduate students and female and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent to which the representation of women on the faculty reflected the representation of women among students . For example , a low proportion of female graduate students would suggest that the proportion of women on the faculty could be limited by the available pool of applicants to assistant professor positions . <p> All of these variables were presented in graphical form , as well as in tables . In general terms , the results brought few surprises beyond what MIT had alerted us to . As the data were discussed , however , members of the University of Texas Faculty Women 's Organization ( n4 ) sought ways to use it to motivate further attention to the status of women , even in those fields in which parity seemed possible . Despite the large amount of work done by the original team in collecting and presenting the data , it seemed to one of us ( Norma Fowler ) that some changes in the way in which the data were summarized and presented would make it easier to discern trends and to see patterns more clearly . The graphs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the future of female faculty on the campus ; they turned a report on a decade of general progress into a more compelling image of what the future might bring if the campus leadership were simply to continue as it had , satisfied with local success stories . Because these strategies may be useful to others analyzing similar data , they are briefly described here . <p> The first of these strategies was a recalculation of women 's salaries before departments were pooled , from " percentage of average salary of rank x in department y " ( as was done in the original report ) to " percentage of aver age male salary of rank x in department y . " ( See fig. 1 . ) The latter formulation is independent of the relative proportions of women and men of rank x in department y ; the former is not . An example may clarify this : <p> Imagine that in department y at rank x , the average male salary = $50,000 and the average female salary = $45,000 ; the average female salary was 90% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original report : if women were 50% of the faculty , their percentage salary would be 95% ; if women were 20% of the faculty , their percentage salary would be 92% ; and if women were 5% of the faculty , their percentage salary would be 90% ; but the recalculated value would be 90% , regardless of what proportion of the faculty of rank x in department y were women . This recalculation was done department by department , rank by rank , year by year , so that the average female salary was always expressed relative to the most comparable male salaries , that is , those of men of the same rank in the same department in the same year . <p> The second strategy used to reanalyze and present the data was to treat the top two ranks , holders of named chairs and holders of named professorships , as the same rank , to increase sample size ( figs. 1 , 2 , 3 . Fig. 3 is included for reference in the Appendix ) . This was done after the salary recalculation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college-by-college , instead of department-by-department , basis . The primary advantage of pooling departments is the much larger sample sizes . The larger the sample size , the more easily an underlying pattern can be detected . In practice we found that a unit ( one rank or set of ranks , in one college in one year ) had to have at least ten women for a pattern to emerge . A second advantage of using a college-by-college analysis was that it was more useful than a department-by-department analysis in meetings with the deans of the individual colleges . As a matter of tactics , presenting the data on a college-by-college basis helped prevent discussion from getting bogged down in the particulars of individual departments ; the new graphs showed the forests rather than the trees . <p> The fourth strategy was to make a number of changes in the way the results were graphed , so as to increase the clarity of the results . For example , only the proportion of women in the faculty , not the proportion of men , was graphed ( fig. 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each graph , as was done in the original graphs , adds no additional information and clutters the graph . These changes in the visual presentation of the data substantially helped viewers grasp the central conclusions . <p> Because the decision was made to pool departments , it become necessary to make some further choices about how this would be done . First , we chose to add the numbers of faculty of a given sex and rank within a college before calculating the proportion of women at that rank in that college . Therefore each woman counts equally in the reported value for her college and rank in a given year , and each department contributes to the reported value in proportion to its size that year . For example , consider a hypothetical college with only two departments . In year z at rank x , department A has five women and fifteen men : 25% women . In year z at rank x , department B has five women and twenty-five men : 16.7% women . The original report 's two graphs would have shown 25% women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph of the combined data would show ( 5+5 ) / ( 20+30 ) = 10/50 = 20% women , which is technically a weighted average ( weighted by department size ) . This is not exactly equal to the unweighted average of 25% and 16.7% ( 20.8% ) . Whenever the departments differ in size , the unweighted average will probably differ from an average that is weighted by department size . The unweighted average will disproportionately reflect the smaller departments . <p> Second , we chose to compute a weighted average salary for each rank in each college in each year , using the number of women in each department as the weighting factor ( fig. 1 ) . This was done after the salary recalculation described above . A weighted salary was used to give each woman 's salary equal weight in the college average for her rank in a given year . <p> Once the data had been reanalyzed and regraphed , we sought additional ways to make the patterns that emerged in these graphs more obvious . In several instances , inspection of the graphed results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank in a particular college had increased , but it was much less obvious how slow the rate of increase really had been . Therefore linear trend lines were calculated and added to the graphic presentations ( fig. 2 ) . A standard statistical technique ( minimizing the summed squared vertical deviations from the line , as is done in linear regression ) was used to calculate each fitted trend line . At the same time , a decision was made that the data were not sufficient to fit nonlinear trend lines ; sample sizes would not justify the estimation of more than the simplest cross-year trends . Adding trend lines to the graphs also helped to some degree to compensate for the " noise " that arose from small sample sizes . <p> To prevent the trend lines from giving a falsely positive picture , we also computed and reported " time to parity . " The actual rate of progress , or lack of it , was dramatically highlighted by reporting the point at which the trend line would cross the 50:50 line ( the year in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Predicted time to parity was reported as " years from now " and included in the graph legends . Some of these values were extremely large , such as 82 years to reach parity in full professors , 226 years to reach parity in chair holders and holders of named professorships . This proved to be an effective way to convey progress or its absence , even though it was obvious to all involved that linear predictions that far into the future are not reliable . <p> No confidence limits were computed , because there is no independent replication in this data set after departments have been pooled . In particular , the data from different years are not ( and can not be considered ) independent observations , because the same individual faculty members appear in the data set year after year . In statistical terms , the proportion of women ( or their average salary ) at one rank , in one college , over the sequence of years , is a single multivariate observation . <p> THE NEW RESULT : A REPORT ON THE REPORTS <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centerpiece of a spring 2001 meeting with the deans of three colleges-Liberal Arts , Fine Arts , and Communications . These three colleges were chosen because they have similar teaching roles within our university . They also have similar patterns of female faculty representation and pay . <p> In general , the picture seemed positive for this group . By 1999 , average female faculty salaries in these colleges were approximately the same as those of men of the same rank and college , despite previous disparities . The other " good news " was that all three colleges had essentially reached gender parity ( 50:50 ) in their assistant professors , and two of them had reached it in their associate professors . <p> The " bad news , " which had not been evident in the original report but which was clear in the graphs of the reanalyzed data , was that none of these three colleges was on a path to reach parity between women and men at higher ranks . <p> Prior to the reanalysis , it had been rather widely , and erroneously , assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same rate as men in these colleges , which would eventually cause the proportion of women in higher ranks to increase and the problem of the paucity of women in higher ranks to " solve itself . " In other words , it had been assumed that the scarcity of women at higher ranks arose solely from the natural lag caused by the time required to move up through the academic ranks . This proved to be untrue . In Liberal Arts , the numbers of female and male assistant professors reached approximate parity by 1995 and the numbers of female and male associate professors were clearly increasing toward parity during the period , but the representation of women at the ranks above associate professor showed no such progress . <p> Because more than one academic generation would be required to reach parity if present trends continue , the problem of parity at higher ranks can not simply have been due to the natural lag inherent in the system . Instead it must have arisen from some other cause , either differential attrition or , possibly , differential hiring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon is sometimes used to refer to such a natural lag and sometimes used to refer to differential attrition ( i.e. , differential " leakage " ) . Therefore we avoid it here . <p> These results steered discussions in new directions , leading to a new look at the problem of sex equity in the higher faculty ranks . To point out the lack of women in the higher ranks of Liberal Arts and the other two colleges is not to dispute that real , tangible progress has indeed been made on other fronts in these colleges . Nor can one cast aspersions on the good faith of the administration over the survey period . Instead , our present situation poses a new challenge : to discover the reasons why women were , and are , not advancing past associate professor and to discover solutions for the situation . Why , in a college in which women were being tenured ( i.e. promoted from assistant to associate professor ) , was there a " glass ceiling " above associate professor ? <p> Moreover , the paradox seemed to be campuswide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal Arts . The College of Communication was similar , and the College of Fine Arts had a " glass ceiling " between assistant and associate professor . One must therefore look for a more general explanation. ( n5 ) <p> One explanatory hypothesis could be discarded using only the available data . The lack of change in the proportions of women in higher ranks was not due to a static professoriate . As ( mostly male ) older faculty members have retired , they have been replaced , as evidenced by the constant or rising numbers of men at each rank in each college . <p> Other hypotheses can not be tested with the report data . These tests would require information about individual careers . For example , were senior women being hired away more frequently than senior men ? Another hypothesis is that something about the ways in which named positions ( chairs , professorships ) were used to recruit and retain faculty made them less likely to be awarded to women . It has been suggested ( and the suggestion is being pursued ) that the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more open . If differential retention or differential hiring at higher ranks are contributing to the " glass ceiling , " administrative attention to retention packages and to recruitment procedures and packages could be effective in increasing the proportion of women at higher ranks . <p> A third hypothesis suggests that women faculty are promoted less frequently , or promoted more slowly , because they tend to partition their time and energy differently than men do , putting relatively more time and energy into service test this hypothesis . <p> If women are in fact devoting relatively more time and energy to teaching and service than men , it is not clear to what extent this arises from female socialization , to what extent it arises from more service and more teaching being requested of women , and to what extent from the interaction of these two factors . It is also not clear what solutions would be appropriate . Increased mentoring has been suggested , as has encouraging department chairs and deans to restrain their requests for service and extra teaching from women . <p> The hypotheses outlined above are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our discussions at the University of Texas , very parallel to those put forth nationally . However , this set of hypotheses is by no means exhaustive . For example , it does not address the effects , if any , of possible concentrations of women in certain subdisciplines , nor of the effects of any overt bias against women , should such exist . <p> Whatever the causes of the patterns we observed , these more precise questions about them would not have been posed without clear evidence that a problem still existed . Nor would resources have been committed , as they were , to follow-up research aiming at finding out what factors not yet considered differentiate the careers of female and male faculty who , as at MIT , otherwise seem to be peers . The collection , appropriate analysis , and effective presentation of institutional data has thus emerged as an essential first step in addressing the representation of women among university faculty and its evolution in the next generation . New stories can lead to new action . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
