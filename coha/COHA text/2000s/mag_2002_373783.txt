Domestic bliss has fled the household of Seiku Murmu and his wife Monica Besra  --  and it 's all Mother Teresa 's fault . Monica is a celebrity in the small village of Dangram , 460 miles northeast of Calcutta , because she is the beneficiary of what many Catholics believe is the first posthumous miracle of Mother Teresa , founder of the Missionaries of Charity . On Sept. 5 , 1998 , the first anniversary of the nun 's death , Monica was suffering abdominal pain caused , she believed , by a tumor . But the purported tumor vanished when Monica applied a medallion with an image of the late Albanian nun to the site of her pain . In August 2001 , Monica 's miracle was supplied to the Vatican as part of the fast-tracking of Mother Teresa 's canonization . Two weeks ago , the Vatican recognized the 1998 miracle , beginning the process of Mother Teresa 's beatification , a major step toward sainthood . <P> All this irritates Monica 's husband Seiku . " It is much ado about nothing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and not by any miracle . " He is peeved at his wife 's fame , in part because the press is constantly at his doorstep . " I want to stop this jamboree , people coming with cameras every few hours or so . " He concedes that the locket is part of the story of Monica 's ordeal but says no one should suppose there was a cause-and-effect relationship between it and the cure . " My wife did feel less pain one night when she used the locket , but her pain had been coming and going . Then she went to the doctors , and they cured her . " Monica still believes in the miracle but admits that she did go to see doctors at the state-run Balurghat Hospital . " I took the medicines they gave me , but , " she insists , " the locket gave me complete relief from the pain . " <P> Dr. Tarun Kumar Biswas and Dr. Ranjan Mustafi , who treated Monica over several months , say their patient indeed had a lump in her abdomen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded to our treatment steadily , " says Mustafi . Monica 's medical records contain sonograms , prescriptions and physicians ' notes that could conceivably help prove whether science or the icon worked the cure . But the records are missing . Monica says Sister Betta of the Missionaries of Charity took them away two years ago . " It 's all with her , " says Monica . A call to Sister Betta , who has been reassigned to another post of the Charity , produced a " no comment . " Balurghat Hospital officials say the Catholic order has been pressuring them to say Monica 's cure was miraculous . Calls to the office of Sister Nirmala , Mother Teresa 's successor as head of the order , produced no comment as well .
