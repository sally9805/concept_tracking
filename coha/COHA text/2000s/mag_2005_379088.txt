Next month , I 'll have spent exactly half my life in Britain and half in America  --  my first 21 years in Britain and my past 21 Stateside . But last week , I felt strangely as if I have lived in the same country all my life . In peril , the bonds deepen . I have n't forgotten how much I wept when the Queen ordered her guards to play The Star-Spangled Banner after 9/11 ; and last week , in the wake of London 's bombings , New Yorkers were Londoners again . Rudy Giuliani was even on the scene . <P> But there was a difference between London on 7/7 and New York City on 9/11 . The first was sheer scale . Mercifully , the atrocities in London were a fraction of the human cost of 9/11 . And the second was related to that but not entirely explained by it . Americans often react to crises with action and emotion . They see a problem and want to fix it . Brits ' reflexive instinct at such times is often calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate quiet was perhaps the most striking thing  --  followed by an insistence on normality . " Work 's over , but there 's little chance of getting home right now , " one Brit e-mailed me . " Most of us are just going to go to the pub until the traffic has died down . It 's not callousness or indifference to carry on as normal ; it 's quiet defiance . " <P> Another e-mailer conveyed the atmosphere : " The pubs are all packed out , people sipping their pints happily . Nice one , al-Qaeda  --  you profess to be from a teetotal religion , and you 've given the pub trade a massive midweek boost . " My sister in the London suburbs looked after a boy whose mom was unable to get home from work . Her first instinct ? She made him a cup of tea . My father , after I called to check up , wryly described the mass murder as " not nice . " One Brit blogger cited another pub scene where in the middle of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images of carnage , quietly reading about the latest soccer scandal in one of the raunchier tabloids . The broadcast of England 's cricket match against Australia was uninterrupted ( except for a small crawl on the bottom of the TV screen letting people know that London transportation had been paralyzed ) . Oh , yes . England won the game . By nine wickets . <P> When Tolkien wrote his Lord of the Rings trilogy , his hobbits were much like English people , and the " Shire " a rough analogy to an England reluctantly roused to fight evil . After one harrowing adventure , two hobbits , Merry and Pippin , found themselves chitchatting as they went along : " They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river . Behind them the light grew in the East . As they walked they compared notes , talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since their capture . No listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered cruelly , and been in dire peril ... "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
