For fervent nonswimmers like me , Steven Spielberg 's JAWS is a cinematic manifesto . We identify with Roy Scheider 's hydrophobic police chief  --  mocked for his fear of water until that hungry shark shows up . This summer marks Jaws ' 25th anniversary , and as a tribute to the No. 1 nonswimmer 's film of all time , a list follows of the other Top 24 films living up to the motto " Do n't go in the water . " Seeing movie stars drown is especially comforting between June and August , the season of peer pressure , when the swimming class harangues the rest of us with nonsense like " a little water never hurt anybody . " Oh , yeah ? we 'll answer . Ever hear the saying " oceans of regret " ? <P> 2 ) SUNSET BOULEVARD and 3 ) THE GREAT GATSBY Swimming pool as watery grave . In the opening sequence of Sunset Boulevard , the police rush to a murder scene where a corpse floats . The voiceover says , " The poor dope . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got himself a pool , only the price turned out to be a little high . " Ditto Gatsby , which ends as Sunset Boulevard began , with police and photographers peering into the bloody water at a man , full of bullet holes , who had wanted a pool to impress the girl whose voice was full of money . <P> 4 ) THE GODFATHER , PART II Hey , Fredo , ix-nay on the oat-bay . <P> 5 ) SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY Nonswimming , battered wife Julia Roberts fakes her own death by drowning to escape her sadistic husband . Months later , the widower runs into a woman from Roberts ' ( secret ) swimming lessons . He understands the ruse , tracks her down in her lovely , landlocked new life and tries to kill her . The moral ? Swimming lessons = death . <P> 6 ) CADDYSHACK So it was only a candy bar in the pool . This time . <P> 7 ) THE RIVER 'S EDGE and 8 ) ON THE WATERFRONT Nearby water as corrupting influence . <P> 9 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daughter ! Desert ! Water ! Hydrating parched Los Angeles requires incest , murder and slicing up Jack Nicholson 's nose . <P> 10 ) THE GRADUATE and 11 ) RUSHMORE Swimming pools symbolize the gaping hole of family life . In The Graduate , Dustin Hoffman 's Ben tries out his snorkel-gear present ; underwater , he can see his parents talking but ca n't hear a word they say . Rushmore transfers the loneliness to the father ( Bill Murray ) . Polishing off his whiskey on the diving board , he jumps into the pool feet first , his wife and children staring at him with confused contempt . <P> 12 ) LAKE PLACID Proclaims the back of this monster movie 's video box : " This year 's Anaconda ! " <P> 13 ) BEACHES Owning a beach house gives you a fatal heart disease , thereby requiring your orphaned daughter to be raised by saucy Bette Midler . <P> 14 ) SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and 15 ) PAULINE AT THE BEACH If there 's anything worse than a beach , it 's a French beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they de-boat on D-day in a rain of enemy fire . In Pauline a la plage , Eric Rohmer 's protagonist probably wishes for shrapnel to off her , if only to spare her the pointless banter of her tacky , divorce cousin .
