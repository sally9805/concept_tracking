Neecey 's Lullaby By Cris Burks Random House Cris Burks The Family Song In June of 1956 , the South Towne Movie Theater sat on Sixty-third and Emerald like an old terra-cotta southwestern fort-the Alamo or Fort Worth . On Saturday afternoons , kids flocked to the theater while adults flocked to Sears Roebuck , F. W. Woolworth 's , Wiebolt 's , and other stores on Halsted Street . The blare of traffic and the chatter of voices fused with the clickety-clack of the Englewood-Howard el . Whites and blacks mingled and went about their weekly shopping and business transactions as if they had co-inhabited Englewood for generations . In 1956 , seven-year-old Neecey 's universe converged on Sixty-third and Halsted . After the Chicago winter curled itself into sleep , she and her daddy , Jesse , walked the five blocks from Sixtieth and Peoria to the bustling business district . They stopped at Fannie May 's and purchased a box of fruit fudge for her mama , Ruby . They stopped at F. W. Woolworth 's for a hot dog , french fries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pile of purchases : aspirin , a bag of steel wool , a bottle of Griffin White Shoe Polish , and finally the doughnuts . The sweet greasy aroma slithered from the shop underneath the el tracks , looped around Jesse and Neecey , and tugged them into the long narrow room . The doughnut shop , always packedto capacity , pulsated with voices that competed with the rumbling el . Rows and rows of glazed , powdered , and coconut doughnuts , chocolate eclairs , and Bavarian creams sat in the glass cases that separated the blue-haired white women from the onslaught of customers . The women rushed up and down their tiny aisle from the large silver coffee urns , to the milk case , to the doughnut racks , and to the cash register . They grabbed money from the drooling men , women , and children while passing bags of greasy doughnuts to them . Once Jesse and Neecey purchased the doughnuts they left the shop and headed for home . " Watch that hole , Daddy , the ground 'll swallow you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk . Her cork brown knees and legs glistened with Vaseline petroleum jelly . Two of her three thick braids bounced against her shoulders . Her front braid brushed against her face and wiped the glaze from the corner of her mouth . Jesse laughed as she leaped across grates and manholes . He was a short , muscular man with tiny feet . His caramel eyes sparkled beneath eyebrows as thick and black as electrical tape . His round nose sloped over a pencil thin mustache and small lips . His mouth turned down in a crooked smile . His brown skin reminded Neecey of golden brown corn bread . When Neecey held his hand , she felt his callused fingertips against her skin . But always , when he touched her face , his hands were gentle . The stores disappeared behind them as they made their way home , jumping across manholes , skipping over cracks in the sidewalks , laughing , running , waving at bus drivers , and oohing over fancy cars-Buicks , Chevrolets , or Cadillacs that soared down the street like big birds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , women working in their gardens exclaimed , " What a pretty little girl ! " Neecey giggled and clasped Jesse 's hands . Yes , she was her daddy 's pretty girl-a thin girl with a long oval face . Her hazel eyes questioned everything . Her nose commanded the center of her face , while her lips , thick and full , spread in a continuous smile . Jesse called her his li'l cutie pie . Because she was happy to be so cute and her daddy 's little girl , Neecey skipped ahead of him , singing Skip , skip , skip to my Lou . Her small squeaky voice rose and disturbed the quietness of that Saturday morning . Jesse , knowing the child could not carry a tune and would never be able to sing a decent note , lifted his bushy eyebrows and grimaced at the women . When they approached their gray stone building , Neecey spied her Uncle Pete leaning against the wide gray column and puffing on his pipe . She ran the last few yards , yelling " Uncle Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip , honey bun ? " He laughed . His narrow eyes sparkled under a thicket of eyebrows . Pete and Jesse 's eyes and lips announced to the world that they were brothers , but the resemblance ended with the thick eyebrows , caramel eyes , and small lips . Pete had a pointy head like a football and a parrot nose that hooked over his tiny lips . Jesse 's was compact and round . Pete was tall and angular . Jesse had small feet . Pete had large feet that always appeared to be moving in different directions . " What kinda doughnuts you get today ? " Pete asked . " Glazed ! Glazed , Uncle Pete ! " She laughed and widened her big round eyes . " Glazed . " Pete laughed and scooped her up . He spun her around . Her legs flew out like kite tails . " Aaah , ha , ha , ha , ha ! " She laughed . " Put me down , Uncle Pete . Ha , ha , ha . Put me down . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he walked up the steps . " Glaze doughnuts coming in for a landing , " Pete said as he lowered her to the porch . He stooped and pulled a big white handkerchief from his back pocket . " You better wipe that glaze from yo ' mouth before yo ' Auntie Della sees it and has a hissie-fit . " " Laud , Jesse , " Pete imitated Della 's voice . " You ai n't got good sense , giving this child sweets before lunch . " Neecey laughed and grabbed his cheeks . She watched his mustache stretch into a thin black line across his face . " Auntie Della , " she said . " Whada big mustache you got . " " Honeybun , yo ' hands are sticky , too ! " Pete said in his own voice . Jesse laughed . " I thought we could sneak past Della today . " " She 's sitting at the dining room table with her Bible opened , " Pete warned as he rubbed his handkerchief across Neecey 's hands . " You ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na catch the Sox game with me or what ? " " Be ready before you can say Jackie Robinson . " Jesse laughed . " Let me get the kids taken care of . " Neecey and Jesse stepped into a jungle of **25;457;TOOLONG , rubber tree plants , and mother-in-law tongues . The jungle separated the dining room from the living room with its furniture sheathed in plastic . A door off the living room led into Pete and Della 's bedroom . Pete 's wife , Della , sat at the dining room table with her eyeglasses perched on the tip of her nose and an open Bible on the table . Behind her was a door leading into the bedroom that Jesse shared with his wife and three children . The center of the plants rustled . Neecey spied the bright red shirt of her four-year-old brother , Jack . " Ssssshhh ! " Jesse said . " Aaargh , " a tiny voice came from the plants . " Daddy , Daddy . " Neecey clutched Jesse 's leg . " Itsa monster ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plants with his arms held high above his head and his hands bent like claws . He resembled Jesse , from his thick , wavy hair to the small frame of his body . " Get ' im , Daddy ! " Neecey cried and hid behind Jesse . " Take the bag , sweetie , " he said and shoved the package at Neecey . She wrapped her skinny arms around the large bag and placed her chin upon the box of doughnuts . Jesse dashed forward and scooped up Jack . " I got the monster ! " he shouted . " I swear , Jesse , " Della said as she looked up from the Bible . Her bat eyes peered over her glasses . " You 're worse than a child . " " You 're worse than an old snot , Della . " He laughed . Like Pete , Della was all bones and angles . While Pete was a soft playful brown , Della was a dark , hard brown . Her shirtwaist dresses lay against her chest like linen on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold much promise of pleasure . Her arms and legs were as skinny as new saplings . Neecey noticed that , as usual , Della was rubbing her left toes around the ankle of her right foot . Her pencil-thin eyebrows narrowed into a V. Her small eyes seemed to disappear in their sockets . " How many doughnuts you let this child eat ? " she asked Jesse . " About six , " he lied and set Jack on the floor . He took the packages from Neecey and started past Della , but twenty-two-month-old Odessa wandered out of the bedroom with a bottle dangling from her mouth . She saw Jesse , and her eyes widened . She popped the bottle from her mouth and ran to him . Jesse swept her up with his free arm and imitated W. C. Fields . " My Li'l Chickadee . " He walked past Della with Jack on his heels . " Come here , Neecey , " Della beckoned as Neecey passed her . She turned the Sunday school book over onto the Bible and drew Neecey to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of Neecey 's face . Her fingers were rough and hard like Jesse 's . " Got glaze all in this child 's hair ! " Della called to Jesse . Della rubbed the braid between her forefinger and thumb as she stared into the child 's almond-shaped eyes . " Honey , you got ta learn to say no thank you or you gon na be Auntie 's fat dumpling . " Neecey looked into Della 's little eyes , " I only ate two , Auntie . " " Two is too much sugar for a li'l girl . I ' spect you wo n't eat a bite of lunch . " Della pushed her glasses up on her face . " Ai n't hungry , " Neecey said . " Jesse ! " Della shouted down the hall . " You hear this ? She ai n't hungry . You filled her with all that sugar and ruined her lunch . " " Della , she had a hot dog . " Jesse returned from the kitchen . " Hmph , and a Coca-Cola and french fries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted and rose from the table . " Only ate one Pay Day , Auntie . " Neecey stepped back and looked up at the tall tree of a woman . " That 's too much sugar ! " Della exclaimed . " You 're gon na drink a glass of milk right now . " Milk was Della 's cure-all . Della grabbed Neecey 's hand and pulled her down the hall . As they passed the bedroom , Neecey saw her mother lying with her back to the door . Her arm rested upon her large beach ball belly . Perspiration ran down Ruby 's face . She felt the sweat attacking each of her red pin curls . Nevertheless , she refused to get up and open the window , refused to let them know she was awake . Children everywhere , she thought and rubbed her belly . She hummed a few bars of " God Bless the Child , " then stopped . She closed her eyes and listened to the family scurrying around the kitchen table . The kitchen was a wide room with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room could have easily held all the members of the family , it was in this kitchen that everyone gathered for meals , news of the day , a game of Spades , or Candyland with the children . Neecey scrambled into the chair next to Jack . Jesse , with a dish towel slung across his shoulder , strained to open a jar of sandwich spread . A loaf of bread and a pack of bologna lay on the table next to a small tray with a sugar bowl , creamer , and condiments . " Why do n't you go on to the game ? " Della said . " I can fix these kids some lunch . " " You 're sure , Della ? " He looked at her as he twisted off the top . " Go on , " she said . She leaned across the table and took the jar from him . " Thanks , " he said and shoved the sandwich fixings across the table . A bedroom door swung open , and Louise stormed out . She was a tall dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders . She threw her hands out as if directing a choir . The hanging flab of her upper arms flapped like flags in a breeze . " Thanks ? " she barked . " Thanks ? You need to get that lazy wife of yours up ! " " Ma'Dear , do n't start on Ruby , " Jesse said as he removed the towel from his shoulder . " She got ta take it easy . Losing this baby would be hard on her . " " Hard ? " Louise sneered as she stormed across the room to the sink . " She do n't want none of . . . " " Louise ! " Della interjected . She looked pointedly at the children . " Why you wan na talk about folks in front of kids , I 'll never know . " " Soon she wo n't be able to , " Jesse said and flung the towel over Louise 's head to the sink . " Do n't think I 'm gon na sweat tears because y'all move out , " Louise said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink . She turned to the stove and poured lukewarm coffee into her cup . " Go on , Jesse , " Della said as she slapped the sandwich spread on a slice of bread . " I 'll take care of the kids ' til you get back . " " Thanks again , Della , " Jesse said . " And you , Ma'Dear , do n't start no bull in front of my children . " " You coulda done so much . . . " " I said no bull , Ma'Dear , " he warned . " Promise me . " " Yeah , yeah , " Louise said and took three gulps of coffee . " Be good , " Jesse said to the children . " Okay , Daddy , " Neecey said and set her long face on her hands . Louise grimaced as he kissed the top of Neecey 's head . She downed the rest of her coffee as he ruffled Jack 's head and then kissed Odessa . He looked in her face as he moved around the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Be a good girl , Louise , " he said and chucked her double chin . She lifted her head and tried to fake a frown . He dropped a kiss on her forehead . " Go on , " she said . " Go on before you miss the first ball . " " Thanks again , Della , " he said and left the room . Della set saucers with sandwiches before Jack and Odessa while keeping an eye on Louise . Louise pulled a face cloth from the pocket of her housedress , turned to the sink , and wet her towel under the running water . " Why ca n't you just go to the bathroom and wash yo ' face like everybody else ? " Della asked as she twisted the top on the jar of sandwich spread . " Why I got ta be a second-class citizen in my own home ? " Louise asked . " I should be able to do any damn thing I want to . " Della 's small bat eyes widened . " Louise ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towel across her face and in the corner of her eyes . " You do n't shock that easily . . . " " Naw , but you got grandchildren at the table , " Della said . " And I do n't want you talking like that around them . " Louise looked at her and nodded . Della 's eyes had narrowed to slits . Louise did not want to upset this daughter-in-law who itched to give her a God-don't-like-ugly sermon . Continues ...
