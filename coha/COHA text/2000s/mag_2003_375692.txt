Can someone please tell me which country I 'm living in ? Last week I sat down and watched a popular new television phenomenon . Queer Eye for the Straight Guy turned out to be a hilarious reality show in which five New York City homosexuals fix a hapless straight guy 's home , hair , clothes and culture in order to win the heart of his female love interest . Here was a wonderful example of straight men and gay men communicating , laughing and getting along . And the gay guys were all about affirming the straight guy 's relationship . At one point , the straight guy actually choked up in gratitude . It was poignant and affirming  --  for both gays and straights . <P> The same day the Republican leadership of the Senate put out a report decrying the terrible possibility that gay people might actually one day have the right to marry the person they love . So alarmed were the Senators that some states might grant marriage rights to gays that they proposed amending the very Constitution of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) anywhere , anytime , anyhow . The next day , in a press conference , President Bush came close to endorsing the move . If the high courts in Massachusetts or New Jersey decide that their state constitutions demand equality in marriage ( something that most observers believe could happen very soon ) , the reactionary movement for an anti-gay constitutional amendment could acquire an awful momentum . <P> How to describe this emotional whiplash ? Every day , if you 're a gay person , you see amazing advances and terrifying setbacks . Wal-Mart set rules last month to protect its gay employees from discrimination  --  about as mainstream an endorsement as you can get . Canada just legalized gay marriage , and the U.S. Supreme Court just struck down sodomy laws across the land , legitimizing the fact that homosexual is something you are , not something you do . Polls in Massachusetts and New Jersey show majorities in favor of equal marriage rights . <P> And now the Vatican comes out and announces that granting legal recognition to gay spouses will destroy the family and society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely analogous " to heterosexual love . The Anglican Church asks a celibate , newly elected bishop in England to give up his post simply because he is gay . Even the leading Democratic candidates refuse to support equality in marriage . Senator John Kerry , who has no biological children with his current ( second ) wife , says marriage should be reserved for procreation , and , with few exceptions , the others toe that line too . And a new poll shows a drop in support for gay rights in the wake of the Supreme Court 's decision against sodomy laws . Another cyclical backlash against gays  --  with echoes of the Anita Bryant campaign in the 1970s  --  looks quite possible .
