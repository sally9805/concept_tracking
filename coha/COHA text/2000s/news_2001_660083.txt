<p> For 94 years , the Orient Express carried princes and tourists , petty crooks and great spies . Its gossips became legends that fed fiction . It has been used to set the scene in mystery novels and films . For example , a trivia question : Who had fistfights aboard the Orient Express in two different films ? Answer : Sean Connery and Robert Shaw demolished a compartment in " From Russia With Love , " then did it again - older and slower - in " Murder On the Orient Express . " You do n't need to be a rail fan to recognize it . If you go to the movies or you read Agatha Christie or Graham Greene , then you know the Orient Express , even if you ca n't name another single train . No other has become a living legend . " Living ? " Nearly a quarter-century after it stopped running ? Sort of . A sad , squalid train by the same name still shuttles between Paris and Bucharest , but the legend is kept alive by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venice . The legend began on Oct. 4 , 1883 , when the Train Express d'Orient , as it was called then , left Paris . Three days , nine hours , and 40 minutes later , its passengers arrived at Istanbul . The journey was a masterpiece of organization : The world 's first transcontinental train rolled across a then-fragmented Europe that had n't even agreed on a coordinated time system then . The enterprise was the work of one man , Georges Nagelmackers , who begged and bullied kings and bureaucrats to let his passengers travel smoothly through seven countries without changing trains , in undisturbed comfort . Marshallers jumped at every border to change engines , dispatchers assured the right-of-way , stations were ready to supply coal and water for the engine , food and drinks for the passengers . The luxurious first-class cars , sleepers , and diners were owned by Nagelmackers 's Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits . The company paid fees for the services of the national railways that owned the tracks on which the train rolled and the engines that pulled it . For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to provide the ultimate in service . This was not just a night train with a diner , but a grand hotel on wheels . Stewards served breakfast in plush bedrooms . A busy kitchen supplied the restaurant with regional delicacies from pheasant to sturgeon . In its first years , there was nothing to rival it . It was called the train of kings - and not only for the occasional royal passenger . Ferdinand I of Bulgaria had helped build the train 's route through his country and took a proprietary attitude , which he expressed by occasionally driving it himself . The Wagons-Lits Co. was relieved when Ferdinand abdicated after World War I , but then his son , Czar Boris , took control , literally . Clad in a custom-tailored white coverall , he would climb on the locomotive and highball the express into Sofia with the pressure gauge past the red line most of the way . The passengers , falling about in the rocking carriages , were not amused . The regulars included Leopold II of Belgium ( a patron and shareholder ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred Wagons-Lits Co. service to private royal trains . King Carol II of Romania found many reasons to travel , reportedly in order to conduct a long , clandestine affair aboard . There were elegant ladies , diplomats , king 's messengers ( chained by their wrists to dispatch cases ) , the super-rich like oil billionaire Calouste " 5 percent " Gulbenkian and Basil Zaharoff ( the arms merchant who traveled in Compartment 7 for decades ) , and Margaretha Zelle , who danced under the name of Mata Hari and was executed for spying . What all these passengers looked for - and found - aboard the Orient Express was impeccable service , deference , and discretion . The Orient Express ran for 94 years ( could a ship or plane match that ? ) . It was already 36 years old when commercial plane flights started with passengers seated in open cockpits ; it still ran when jumbo jets flew daily . It survived World War I and its aftermath , when the Allies routed it outside defeated Germany and Austria , via Switzerland and the Simplon Tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or were permitted , to cross politically opposed territories , and the Wagons-Lits Co. was reluctant to send expensive first-class cars to the Balkans , where they tended to get lost . The great express ran with ever-fewer cars and poorer service - and had ever-fewer and poorer passengers . I took this train a few times . On the socialist frontier , the smiles and salutes of stationmasters had been replaced by the frowns and grunts of gray-clad police . Border guards peeked under the seats and lifted ceiling panels . They kicked their way around large cartons in the corridors , TV sets , and washing machines ferried home by Romanian guest workers . The train still followed its old route , but with cars detached and attached at major stops , one had to be nimble to stay on it . Finally , the bickering railways killed it in 1977 . On May 20 that year , the last direct train from Paris to Istanbul took off - 20 minutes late . The rattling skeleton that is left of the old express still reaches Bucharest , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On other days it stops in Budapest . There is now talk of stopping even this shortened service . But that was n't the end of the luxurious Orient Express . The Wagons-Lits Co. gave up on its eastern route , but two entrepreneurs believed that there was a market for nostalgia and splurging . The first to revive the glamour was Albert Glatt , a Swiss businessman who bought and restored 1920s vintage sleepers and dining cars to be used in private trains . Starting in 1976 , these plied the route around Reims and ventured on long excursions to Russia and China . The flagship of the enterprise is the Nostalgic Orient Express , a luxurious land cruise between Zurich and Istanbul a few times a year . Since 1982 , another Orient Express has been running between London and Venice . Like the original , this is not an occasional trip but a scheduled service . But , scheduled though it may be , the Venice Simplon-Orient Express ( VSOE ) is not an ordinary train . Its code , OEX , may appear on railway station monitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ornate , blue ticket envelopes . This is an exclusive private train . The VSOE is the baby of James Sherwood , boss of Sea Containers Ltd. , who also liked old rail cars and bought some . He restored their original beauty - the inlaid wood paneling , brass , and Lalique glass fixtures . He had them brought up to current safety standards - new flame-proof upholstery was woven to original patterns . My journey on this train was exquisite . As soon as I boarded , nostalgia for times before my birth washed over me . My sleeping car was built by hand in 1926 , and its condition met the standards of that vintage . In the nickel-plated fixtures , the slots of all the screws lined up vertically , a tiny detail to delight those of us who recognize and admire craftsmanship from a prouder time . I had a drink in the bar car where a live pianist enlivened the 1920s art deco opulence . A couple sat on the other side , the man in black tie , the woman in a flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I saw the last light of the day glint pink on a snowy peak . Back in my compartment , I found my bed made and slippers laid out . The coal-fired furnace , stoked by the steward , heated as well as any 21st-century system . I slept the sleep of the rich , and in the morning someone brought breakfast and the day 's International Herald Tribune . Then , I was in Paris . Was it like that in the good old days ? Neither I , nor the operators were there in 1926 , so we could n't compare it . But the dream worked . European trains just keep getting faster and faster Europeans are determined to have in their future unclogged airports , unjammed highways , and unpolluted air - so they keep on making their trains better and faster , and therefore more popular . This year the French Railways celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first high-speed Train a grande vitesse . When the TGV started service in 1981 between Paris and Lyon , it cut travel time from four to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their passengers between the two cities to trains , and car traffic dropped by a third . Why fight on the highway when you can get there in half the time while having lunch - at 172 m.p.h. ? For its 20th birthday the " old " TGV Southwest will see its speed raised to 186 m.p.h. when the new TGV Mediterranee opens this summer . The line has been extended to Marseille to bring it and the whole Cote d'Azur closer to Paris by 1 hour and 20 minutes . The high-speed track now stops at Marseille , but in 2005 will continue through a tunnel under the Pyrennes to Barcelona - 186 m.p.h. all the way on a 710-mile stretch . The TGV Med will add to the ever-increasing high-speed network for the continent 's premier trains , such as Spain 's Alaris , AVE , Euromed and Talgo 2000 , the ICE in Germany , TAV in Italy , X2000 in Sweden , the French-Italian Artesia , the Swiss-Italian Cisalpino , the five-country Thalys , and the undersea Eurostar , which connects London , Brussels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125 m.p.h. in Europe . But the best things in life often cost more , and train fares are no exception . The affordable way for overseas visitors has been with go-as-you-please passes that offer considerable savings over point-to-point tickets . They are valid for unlimited use - as often and as far as you like - on all trains , on many ferries , lake ships , and some buses . You pay only for seat and couchette reservations . However , some premier trains are not covered by passes , but pass-holders are offered fare reductions . Choose a pass according to the length and breadth of your trip . The classic Eurailpass covers 17 countries . The latest addition , the Eurail Selectpass , lets you tailor your region by choosing any three adjacent countries . Europass covers the five most-visited core countries . Other international passes , such as ScanRail or East Europe , let you roam four or five adjacent countries . Use a national pass ( like BritRail or Italy Rail Card ) if you visit just one country .
