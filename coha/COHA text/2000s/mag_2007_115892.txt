EARLY THIS PAST March , on the eve of a men 's Masters Series tennis tournament at Indian Wells , Calif. , the phone rang in Dmitry Tursunov 's hotel room . " Would you like to make some money ? " the caller asked . It was n't the first time the 27th-ranked Russian had been asked that question in that particular way . In the fall of 2006 , Tursunov was contacted by an unknown voice offering cash for match fixing . " It happened to a lot of players , " he said . " I do n't know if it 's the same person , but I think everybody gets contacted . And whether you act on it or not , it 's a problem . " // And you thought tennis 's biggest headaches were sagging TV ratings and goofy outfits . Still reeling from suspicious betting patterns surrounding an Aug. 2 match involving its No. 4 player , Nikolay Davydenko , the sport has found its American showcase , the U.S. Open , dominated by a scandal in the making . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy against betting ; personnel from a hurriedly hired security firm monitor the players lounge . American player Paul Goldstein told USA Today that he 'd been contacted by gambling interests . Lleyton Hewitt said France 's Michael Llodra had also , and the French newspaper L'Equipe reported that two unnamed players admitted the same . Last week , No. 56 Janko Tipsarevic told SI that he , too , has fended off gamblers seeking an edge , leaving the impression of a tour under quiet and slimy siege . " Gambling was the elephant in the room , " said ATP president Etienne de Villiers . " So the elephant has finally come out . " // Tipsarevic says he was approached by strangers " maybe a couple of times , but before they even say the price , how much , I say , ' Please , please , please , ' and then they leave me alone . Normally it 's a guy you 've seen for the first time in your life . He says , ' Hi , how are you ? ' And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In a sense this should come as no shock : Especially outside the U.S. , gambling on tennis is a booming business . At Betfair , the largest online bookmaker in England , tennis is the third-most-popular sport ( behind horse racing and soccer ) and the fastest growing . Betfair expects to take in $1 billion in bets on this year 's U.S. Open  --  up 50% from last year . Last month Betfair canceled all bets on a match between Davydenko and Argentine Martn Vassallo Argello in Sopot , Poland , after seeing a tenfold spike in betting  --  with most bets going against Davydenko after he won the first set . Davydenko retired from the match in the third set due to a foot injury . A week later he was playing in Montreal . ( He proclaimed his innocence and is expected to talk to tour investigators later this month. ) // But long before l'affaire Davydenko , tennis was ripe for a betting scandal . Players operate independently , beyond the prying eyes of teammates or team staff . A five-set match can easily turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramps . The Australian Open has betting windows on-site , bookmakers work a short walk from Wimbledon 's grounds , and one of the sport 's most storied matches  --  the 1973 Battle of the Sexes between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs  --  is still dogged by rumors that Riggs , a longtime hustler , made a bundle by betting on King . // Ever since the rise in Internet betting threw the result of a 2003 match between future pro poker player Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Fernando Vicente into question , tennis has tried to build what ATP officials call " a wall " around the game . Yet every player represents a potential entry point . Both Tursunov and Tipsarevic said that they did n't report their suspicious conversations to ATP officials . Their attitude is n't rare . Odd as it seems , the same players who complain about thieves in the Wimbledon locker room have n't been nearly as panicked about their integrity . " I can say , ' Somebody called me , ' " Tursunov said , " but what are they going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ATP board would push for a rule stipulating that players must report even the slightest whiff of attempted tampering or face penalties . The organization had better do more than push , though . Anytime you have billions being bet on human beings , corruption is a given . Without the players ' full commitment here , tennis does n't stand a chance . // ONLY AT SI.COM Your one stop for offbeat humor and the wackiest sports stories and links , including Hot Clicks and the Daily List , is SI.com/extramustard.
