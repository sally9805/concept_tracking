You know the car you are driving is something special when the parking valet compliments you on it . After all , this guy sees and drives everything . So even though the Manhattan garage where I parked for an hour last Thursday afternoon was packed with Lexuses , BMWs and other luxury vehicles , I knew the attendant was right on when he commented that the $30,000 Ford Escape Hybrid I was driving was a " nice car . " <P> It 's much more than nice , though . The first hybrid SUV sold in the U.S. and the first American hybrid car , it is also a technological breakthrough at a fair price . The model TIME tested has a sticker price of $30,750 thanks to extras like a navigation system and leather seats , but the basic model starts at $26,380 . Several other hybrid SUVs are on the way , including a Toyota Highlander in 2005 and a Saturn Vue in 2006 , but so far only Ford has delivered . <P> The Escape Hybrid 's gas engine is a modest four-cylinder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice for a combined 155 hp . The motor is powered by a 250-lb. battery pack that lies flat beneath the cargo area , where the spare tire would normally go . The battery is automatically recharged during driving and braking . <P> In TIME 's 200-mile test drive of one of the first production models , which is identical to the models consumers are getting , the Escape Hybrid 's fuel economy matched or beat its EPA ratings of 36 m.p.g. in the city and 31 m.p.g. on the highway . TIME got 36 m.p.g. in the city and 34 m.p.g. on the highway , according to the dashboard display . <P> What I have always liked best about hybrids is the complete silence you enjoy when they 're running on the electric motor . So it was all the more jarring to hear the gas engine rumble on at unexpected moments . The Escape Hybrid can run solely on electric power when idling and at speeds of up to 25 m.p.h . But unless you accelerate gently , the engine will come on at lower speeds . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freeway . <P> You pay a premium for a hybrid , in this case $3,500 more than for a regular Escape , which looks nearly identical . In exchange , you get gas mileage that is nearly twice as good in the city ( 36 m.p.g. vs. 20 m.p.g. ) and 6 m.p.g. better on the highway . And for now , you get a $1,500 tax write-off from Uncle Sam . Do the math , and you quickly realize that you still wo n't save money overall with a hybrid . But you will spend less time at the pump and drive the most fuel-efficient SUV in America .
