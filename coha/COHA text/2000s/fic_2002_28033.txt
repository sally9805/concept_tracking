Blackwater Sound By James W. Hall Minotaur Books Prologue The marlin was the color of the ocean at twenty fathoms , an iridescent blue , with eerie light smoldering within its silky flesh as if its electrons had become unstable by the cold friction of the sea . A ghostly phosphorescence , a gleaming flash , its large eyes unblinking as it slipped into a seam in the current , then rose toward the luminous surface where a school of tuna was pecking at the tiny larvae and crustaceans snagged on a weed line . The marlin attacked from the rear of the school . An ambush . It accelerated from thirty knots to double that in only a few yards . A fusion of grace , efficiency , and blinding power . For a creature with the bulk of a bull , the marlin was as sleek as any missile and blazed through the water at a speed not even the most powerful torpedo could attain . When it crashed into the school , it stunned each fish with a blow from its three-foot bill , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the curved arc of its tail . She saw its shadow just below the surface . Maybe it was simply the angle of the sun , but the fish looked twice the size of an ordinary marlin . Before she could utter a word , the marlin hit the trolled lure and the outrigger popped . Fish on ! Johnny yelled . In the fighting chair Morgan lifted the rod and settled it into the leather holder that was belted around her waist . At the same moment the rod tip jerked and the hundred-pound monofilament began to scream off her reel . Nothing she could do for now except hold on and watch . They were twenty-two miles south of Key West , a marlin highway that ran along a drop-off in the ocean floor , an east-to-west ridge that plummeted from nine hundred feet to two thousand in less than a mile . Wood 's Wall was its name , the beginning of the Straits of Florida . Andy and Johnny stood beside her . Her two brothers . Andy was the older , curly blond hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science whiz , chemistry , electronics . He spent long hours in the MicroDyne lab , tinkering with new materials , new fibers , new everything . He was movie-star handsome , funny . A gifted athlete , president of his high school class , perfect scores on his college boards , courted by Stanford , M.I.T. A golden boy . Everyone in awe of him , most of all Johnny . Johnny was the quiet kid who tracked his big brother 's every move , stood in his shadow , said little . Morgan was the second child , a year younger than Andy , with electric blue eyes , a sinuous figure , glossy black hair that she wore as short as Andy 's . She was well aware of the effect she had on boys , but did n't give a damn about trading on her looks , scoring points in the Palm Beach social scene . She 'd rather hang with Andy . The two of them endlessly tinkering in A.J. 's workshop or at the company lab . Metallurgy , ceramics , carbides . Morgan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creative one , spontaneous and intuitive , a genius . She was the yin to his yang . The controlled left brain to his exuberant right . A neatly nestled fit . Up on the flybridge , Darlene Braswell stood beside her husband , watching her daughter closely . A tall , black-haired woman with shadowy Italian eyes . A violinist with the Miami Symphony till she 'd met and married A.J. Braswell . Now a vigilant mom . Too vigilant . She and Morgan had n't spoken for days . A bitter standoff . Last week , coming into Morgan 's room , staring at her for a full minute in prickly silence . Morgan knew what it was about , but did n't think her mother had the nerve . She held Morgan 's eyes and finally spoke , voice neutral , asking if anything was going on she should know about . Going on ? Morgan playing dumb . You know what I mean , Morgan . Is something happening between you and Andy ? Morgan said nothing , glaring into her mother 's dark eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss this , then I 'll talk to Andy . One way or the other , I 'm going to find out . You go ahead , Mom , talk to Andy , but if you do , I 'll never speak to you again . Never . Now get out of my room . Morgan pointed at her door , kept pointing till her mother turned and walked to the door and stood there a moment waiting for Morgan to open up . But she did n't . She was n't about to . Her mother would n't understand . Never . Not in a million years . From up on the flybridge her father yelled at her to pay attention . A little more before you hit him . Ease off on your drag , this is a big girl . She picked her moment , then yanked back on the rod , sunk the hook , and in the next instant the fish showed itself . Forty yards behind them , its long bill broke through , then its silver head , holding there for several seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her measure . The fish shook its head furiously and flopped on its side and was gone . Sounding , diving down and down and down , the reel shrieking , the rod jumping in her hands as if she 'd hooked a stallion at full gallop . On the bridge , A.J. was silenced by the sight . Johnny stood at the transom transfixed , staring out at the blue water where the fish had disappeared . His blond hair hung limply down his back . A pudgy baby , a pudgy kid , and now a pudgy teenager . Smiling at the wrong times , always fidgeting , gnawing his fingernails to the quick . Her dad stood with his butt to the console , reaching behind him to run the controls , doing it by feel , backing the thirty-one-foot Bertram toward the spot where the fish had disappeared . The Braswells worked as a unit . It required first-rate teamwork to catch these fish . No one could do it alone , not the big ones . Someone to handle the boat , keep it positioned ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to grab the leader when the fish was finally brought close to the boat . Then a gaffer who nailed the fish in its bony jaw and helped haul it through the transom door . The five of them circulating the jobs . You okay , Morgan ? You want some water ? Andy asked . She was pumping the rod , then cranking on the downstroke . For every yard of line she won back the fish was taking out two . The reel was more than half-empty and Morgan had begun to sweat , her fingers throbbing already , back muscles aching . In only twenty minutes the fish was making her pant . Water , yes , Morgan said . He held the water bottle to her lips , tipped it up . With a towel he mopped her forehead . He gave her shoulders a rub , stayed with it for a while , a good massage , working his fingers in deep . The line went out in screaming bursts and with grim focus she reeled it back in , inch by grueling inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps . A.J. cheering her on , giving her small instructions , though Morgan knew the drill as well as he did . She could hear it in his voice , a trace of envy . It should be him in the chair . It was his passion more than hers . He went to the tournaments . Mexico , Bahamas , Virgin Islands . He hung out with marlin men . Went fishing on the bigger boats of his rich friends . Boats with full-time crews . Two million , three million dollars purchase price , a few hundred thousand a year to maintain and staff them . He lusted for one of those boats , a sixty-footer with four thousand horsepower rumbling belowdecks . At the rate MicroDyne was growing , it would n't be long before he could afford one . Her dad should be the one in the chair hauling this fish to the surface . But that was n't how it worked . The Braswells rotated the angling on a set routine . Morgan first thing in the morning , Andy next . After lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot , and finally in the last hours of the day , it was Johnny 's turn . Johnny , who would rather work the wire , the close-in stuff . He did n't want the spotlight for hours at a time , did n't have the patience for that kind of labor . He liked the big , dramatic moments . Slipping on the heavy glove and taking a couple of quick wraps and then arm-wrestling that fish to the edge of the boat , gaffing it . An hour passed . Andy gave her water , her father rooted her on . As Morgan pumped the reel , her mother watched silently . Morgan was dizzy . Despite the fluids , she felt dehydrated . They 'd not seen any sign of the fish again . It was down about nine hundred feet and was heading east out to deeper water . Her dad was quiet now , handling the boat . Wanting to be in the chair so much , but not a whiner , trying to be encouraging to his daughter . You want me to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him no , she wanted to see this to the end . Her hands were numb . Her back muscles in spasm . She struggled to breathe . The fish was down there cruising east , towing them toward the horizon . She held on because that 's what you did in this family . She held on because to give up would change things . She would lose something she could n't name . Some part of her identity . Who she was , who she wanted to be . It was what her father would do , and what Andy would do . So she hung on . She pumped and cranked on the downstroke . She fought that goddamn fish . Then it was two hours . A little after ten in the morning . She 'd refilled the reel more than halfway . Bringing the fish up , winning the battle . She lifted the rod , then lowered it and pumped the reel . Lifted it , lowered it and pumped . The world was now a narrow slit through which she saw only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue was swollen . Her hands were knotted with pain , arm muscles quivering , but she cranked the reel . It was almost noon when she felt the slack . A belly in the line . No pressure when she reeled . She realized what was happening and was about to call out to the others when the marlin rocketed the last few yards to the surface . In a great geyser it exploded , silver and blue , its entire electric length , shimmering like polished chrome and the bluest blue , a scream erupting on the boat , from her mother , from the entire Braswell clan , a chilling collective roar , as the marlin launched itself high into the air and hung in all its colossal radiance , a terrible angel against the clouds and sun and sky , like some divine appearance , the embodiment of all fish , of all life in the sea , a giant long-billed , scythe-tailed deity , a monster , dreadful and magnificent . Broken loose from gravity , hanging there for longer than was possible . Finally it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water as high as the flybridge . Morgan reeled and reeled , cranking as fast as her muscles allowed . It was the largest fish she 'd ever seen . Larger than the blue marlin on the wall of her father 's study . His was eight hundred pounds , caught in the Virgin Islands when he was twenty-eight . The fish that had started his obsession . But this one was half again as large . A giant . Bigger than anything in the magazines , anything on the endless videos A.J. 's friends brought back from the Great Barrier Reef or Kona . This was the mothership . Her father was silent . Everyone was silent . Johnny turned to look at his older brother , and whatever he saw on Andy 's face made Johnny 's mouth go slack . This was not just a big fish . This was the fish that lurked in their dreams . Jesus , Andy said quietly . Jesus . He came behind her and once again he massaged her shoulders while she cranked the last few yards of line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's given up , her dad said . You beat it . It 's given up , Morgan . But she did n't think so . Until just before the leap , the marlin 's power seemed undiminished . The fish was still green . Still strong and alive . Unfazed by the fight . But the leader was only a few feet away , the fish lying slack a few feet below the surface . So maybe she was wrong . Maybe it had caved in after just one spectacular jump . Andy let go of her shoulders , turned , and flung open a drawer in the supply case and grabbed a stainless steel cylinder a little larger than a cigar . It was one of Andy 's inventions . A float on one end , a stubby aerial on the other . It was designed to be hooked beneath the marlin 's second dorsal fin with a small surgical steel anchor , and was programmed to come alive for one week each year . On the appointed date , the electronic sending unit would begin to transmit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-by-day report on GPS locations , depth , water temperature , speed , distance traveled . By activating it only during that one-week window , Morgan estimated the unit would last for eight to ten years . Sometime during the crucial week when the transmitter came live , they had to get lucky and the marlin had to break the surface , either to sun itself or to attack schools of baitfish . Just a few seconds was all . When the antennae broke through , data would stream up to a satellite and a few seconds later the blue ping would pulse on the Braswells ' receiving unit . The ping would mark the fish 's present location and would continue to ping until the fish was submerged again or the week was over and the unit shut off . Much better than conventional tagging methods . If it worked , it could revolutionize everything . You could track a fish 's migration , begin to understand its life cycle , its mating habits . Steal a look into the secret life of that mysterious fish . But she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed and assembled it from salvaged computer parts . The pod was a gift to their dad , their attempt to take part in his consuming obsession . Andy used a tiny ice pick to activate the unit , then clamped it just behind the sharp point of a customized harpoon . Morgan hauled the fish closer and could see its blue shadow rising through the water . Listless , on its side . Either defeated or playing possum . It was impossible to tell . Andy leaned over the transom , cocked the harpoon back , picking his spot . Her mother called down to Andy . In her tense voice , telling him to be careful . Very careful . Andy leaned another inch or two , then stood back up . It 's too far , Dad ! I 'm going to have to wire it , bring it up closer . Morgan , A.J. called . Keep the line tight . Keep it close so Andy can work . Andy grabbed his glove from the back pocket of his shorts and pulled it on . Another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick cowhide pad stitched across the palm and sides . Even a medium-sized fish could badly bruise a hand , or sometimes crush bones . Johnny seized the biggest gaff from the holder . We 're not gaffing it , Johnny , A.J. called . We 're just attaching the pod . But this is a world record , Dad . This is the all-time big mother . All of them laughed and from that moment , Big Mother was her name . Tag and release , Johnny , that 's what we 're doing . Stubbornly , Johnny held on to the gaff , planting himself at the starboard side of the transom while Andy stood to port , the harpoon in his right hand . He was touching the metal leader wire with his left , stroking it lightly as if wanting to establish some connection with the giant . Morgan had handled the wire on small sails and yellowfin tuna . It was dangerous , but thrilling . The saying went , One wrap , you lose the fish , three wraps you lose a finger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader wire around the gloved hand , no more , no less . Andy took three . Morgan was n't sure if she 'd seen right . Her mind so foggy . Her tongue so swollen , she could barely speak . Maybe he took one more wrap for extra measure , because the fish was huge , maybe he made a mistake , or she was simply wrong about what she thought she 'd seen . A.J. backed the boat slowly . Okay , Andy . Pick your spot , jab it in hard and true . Johnny edged closer to his brother , gaff at the ready . Slowly the bill appeared as Andy hauled it up . Jeez , it 's way over a thousand pounds . Maybe fifteen hundred . Andy had the fish at the transom . Its bill was longer than any she 'd ever seen in photographs , on walls , anywhere . Johnny leaned over the edge to touch the fish . No , Johnny . Let Andy do his work . The fish must have seen their shadows because it shied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned back , using all his weight to drag the fish back into place . Morgan could see the muscles straining in his back , in his arms and shoulders . A wiry boy , narrow-waisted , wide shoulders and rawhide-tough . But the fish was strong , very strong . Andy cocked his arm , held it for a second , then plunged the point of the harpoon into the second dorsal . It 's set , Dad ! I felt it lock on . He should n't have done it . Should n't have turned his back on the fish to beam up at their father . With a fish that big , it was reckless . But he was so proud , so hungry for a morsel of their dad 's approval . In that half second his back was turned , the fish swung back and made a slow pirouette , disappearing into the transparent blue . Andy was jerked backwards , his hip banging against the transom . Johnny reached out for him but it was too late . Andy lurched overboard , his hand trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stifled as he was dragged under , saw him moving quickly through two feet of water , three , four , five , saw him turning back toward the light , trying to swim one-handed toward the surface , a useless stroke against the horrific power of that fish . She saw his face , his blond hair pulsing like a jellyfish around his head , she saw his white flesh turning blue , blue as the water , blue as the fish . Reel , Morgan ! Reel , goddamn it ! A.J. was screaming . A second later he was beside her . He tore the rod from her hands , cranked the fish back up , cranked . But the line continued to unspool , the sharp ratchet of the reel clicking faster than she 'd ever heard it . A.J. heaved back on the rod , tightening the drag as he did , pulling with all his weight , all his life and breath and muscle . Morgan could n't scream , could n't breathe . A dull paralysis had taken hold of her . Shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting chair , watched the water , saw a flash of white . Andy 's face , his shorts , something . Down in all that blue , his body dragged deeper and deeper into the airless depths . A bear hug crushed her chest , a pressure greater than bones and flesh could possibly withstand . Her father was groaning as he reeled against the power of that fish , winning back a few feet , a few more . Johnny dropped to his knees , holding to the transom as if he were seasick , peering out at the water . From the flybridge Darlene screamed . Her boy , her precious son . Her wail ripped apart the air . And then the crack of a rifle shot as the heavy monofilament snapped . Her father crashed against the side of the chair and crumpled to the deck . Without a thought , Morgan kicked off her boat shoes , climbed onto the transom and dove into the water and clawed her way down into the blue . She swam deeper and deeper until the light was flickering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unbearable , then swam deeper still , squinting into the blurry distance , into the blackwater depths where the sounding fish had disappeared , but she could make out nothing in the darkness of the cold currents . Then out of those murky depths a trail of bubbles rose toward her , a ghostly silver cloud climbing fast , spreading out , surrounding her , tickling across her bare arms , her belly . Andy Braswell 's last breath . Her brother . Her love .
