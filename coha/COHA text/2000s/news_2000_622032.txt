<p> Ask a government official or nearly anyone on the street what they think about the U.S. debate over giving trade benefits to China and you 'll get the same response : a proud , injured stare . <p> They 'll tell you about how the economic boom is transforming their country and how sinister forces in the United States are trying to keep China from taking its proper place on the world stage . <p> Ask about Beijing 's military saber-rattling over Taiwan , its jailing of dissidents and human rights activists , or its tolerance of labor rights abuses , and the answer is the same : <p> Why us ? Why do you pick on China ? Why do you demand things from us that you do n't demand of other nations ? <p> They have a point . The United States tolerates anti-democratic practices in many other nations that it does business with . <p> But the Chinese also seem blind to the multidimensional aspects of the debate in Congress . <p> The fight over so-called permanent normal trade relations has , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . <p> Unlike the debate in 1993 over the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico , the central issue this year is not jobs , but rather the future ground rules of the fast-expanding global economy . <p> Like the riot-scarred Seattle summit of the World Trade Organization in December , the debate in Washington is about rights  --  human rights , labor rights , environmental rights , corporate rights . <p> On the streets of China , these are strange and foreign words . <p> The tangible , gleaming , in-your-face reality of today 's China  --  its new prosperity , its success as a world trader  --  all carry enormous weight . For many Chinese people , it is a kind of sweat equity . <p> " We have earned the right to be taken seriously , " said one Beijing man who approached a Chronicle reporter on the capital 's subway . " We are hard workers . Write that down ! Look at us ! " <p> Then he turned away and quickly disappeared into the crowd . <p> While the man 's sincerity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime 's propaganda . <p> The nation 's media , which are tightly under the thumb of government censors , have given the public a daily drumbeat of news chronicling President Clinton 's campaign to back the trade bill . <p> The lockstep coverage , as unquestioningly favorable as if it were written by the White House press office or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , has generally ignored U.S. opposition to the bill . When mentioned , the foes are portrayed as protectionists , racists , fools or worse . <p> Objective information is scarce on the Internet , too , because the Chinese government controls the content on local Web sites  --  and blocks access to many U.S. media sites , including SF Gate . <p> Indeed , some of the U.S. talk on rights is hypocrisy . After all , the United States gives permanent trade benefits to such undemocratic nations as Saudi Arabia and Vietnam . <p> Some democratic U.S. trading partners also have scarred records . For example , Malaysia , Bangladesh and Pakistan all ban unions in large parts of their export industries . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer is an innocent , underdeveloped country . It is an economic colossus , a major player on the stage of world capitalism . <p> What the skeptics in Seattle and Washington really fear is that communist-run China may act like too much of a capitalist , riding roughshod over its 21st century workers in 19th century sweatshop fashion . If China is granted free access to world markets , they say , it will cause a race to the bottom in wages , working conditions and bargaining power for workers from Southeast Asia to California . <p> The Chinese government bitterly opposes the U.S. proposals for labor and environmental standards to be included in the WTO , saying U.S. industries will use them to shut out products from poor nations . The Seattle summit broke down in part because many developing nations had similar views . <p> If China joins the WTO , it might not react with any sense of gratitude , but instead rally opposition to the U.S. line . <p> " If China joins the WTO , the WTO will become unreformable , given China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken on these issues , " said Mark Levinson , an AFL-CIO lobbyist . " It may forestall the possibility of progress on worker rights for decades . " <p> Levinson 's talk about rights sounds strangely theoretical for an American union leader . In part , this is because the United States is in boom times , with low unemployment and little fear of layoffs . <p> But it shows how each side of the U.S. debate has been forced to back off some of its claims . <p> Although pro-labor economists have estimated that 890,000 jobs would be lost nationwide by 2010 as a result of granting permanent benefits to China , this is such a tiny fraction of the U.S. economy  --  1.7 million jobs were added to the workforce in 1999 alone  --  that unions have downplayed the problem . <p> For its part , the Clinton administration has talked only vaguely about jobs . Early in the debate , U.S. officials grudgingly admitted that the trade bill would have little if any impact on U.S. exports to China . <p> Because of the terms of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States all WTO-mandated cuts in tariffs once China joins the WTO even if this year 's trade bill is rejected . U.S. firms would be ineligible for China 's concessions only on services and investment  --  that is , on rules for U.S. firms that want to set up shop in China , not America . <p> Other critics of the U.S.-China deal over Beijing 's WTO membership last November complain that it ignores social issues while making provisions for obscure U.S. products such as golf carts and weasel hair . <p> Even many experts who support free trade say the Clinton administration has bungled the opportunity to advance broader U.S. goals . <p> " The United States has missed its chance to develop a linkage between trade , the environment and a broader foreign-policy agenda , " said Daniel Esty , director of Yale University 's Center for Environmental Law and Policy . <p> In February , Esty was named co-chair of an environmental advisory panel for U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky , who signed the November deal . <p> Esty said American diplomats should have used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over issues such as reducing greenhouse gases , destruction of the ozone layer and endangered species protection . <p> But to many Chinese , that kind of talk is unreal . <p> " Talk to anyone anywhere in China , and no one will understand the U.S. position , " said Apo Leung , director of Asia Monitor Resource Center , a Hong Kong think tank . <p> " Whatever the results of this vote , I think we are in for a long period of time in which China and the United States are intimately connected economically , but disagree completely over what that means . <p> " Who runs the world economy , how should it be reformed ? I 'm not sure I know myself . " <p> CHINA 'S INTERNET BLACKLIST <p> The Chinese government likes foreign investors , but it has a decidedly mixed view of the foreign media . To prevent unfavorable news from being spread on the Internet , the Communist authorities have blocked access to many U.S. media Web sites . When Chinese Web surfers try to call up the vetoed address , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This censorship is shrouded with an official veil of silence ; for example , a Chinese Embassy spokesman said he was " not aware " that any U.S. media sites are blocked , although he noted that U.S. government Web sites , including those of congressional critics of China , are not . <p> Here are examples of media sites that are on the blacklist  --  and some that are not . <p> BLOCKED : <p> San Francisco Chronicle ( The Gate ) <p> New York Times <p> Washington Post <p> Los Angeles Times <p> San Jose Mercury News <p> CNN <p> UNBLOCKED : <p> Wall Street Journal <p> USA Today <p> Sacramento Bee <p> San Francisco Examiner
