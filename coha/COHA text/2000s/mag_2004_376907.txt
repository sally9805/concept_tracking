Paul Rusesabagina ( Don Cheadle ) is a smooth and accommodating guy . Neat and trim in his habitual jacket and tie , he 's a black man managing a luxury hotel in Kigali , Rwanda , a decade ago , making friends and doing favors across racial and national boundaries . He knows when an obsequious word or a proffered bottle of single-malt Scotch will do him the most good with corrupt local officialdom . And he is doing his best to ignore the rising tensions between his country 's ruling Hutu tribe ( of which he is a member ) and the rebellious Tutsi . <P> Then , however , tension turns into genocide . And Rusesabagina turns from glorified houseboy into antiheroic hero . His hotel can offer hundreds of terrified Tutsi food , beds and the protection of a thin , blue-helmeted line of U.N . peacekeepers , commanded by Colonel Oliver ( Nick Nolte ) . The big question is , Can the volatile local militia , eager to stamp out " cockroaches " ( its name for the Tutsi ) , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story with admirable objectivity , possibly because the real-life character said he would n't have had it any other way . He turned down several offers to participate in documentaries and cable movies because he felt they would n't find a large enough audience . ( This year being the 10th anniversary of the massacre , there are already several documentaries on the subject on the festival circuit . ) The genial hotel manager of the past is no more . Now owner of a trucking concern and living in Belgium , Rusesabagina says the horrors he witnessed in Rwanda " made me a different man . I used to be friendly , to trust people , to trust in my friends , but that has changed . " <P> One thing about him , however , has not varied : his fierce love for his wife , who is a Tutsi , and their children . It is , the film makes clear , the model for the protective passion he extended to the 1,268 " guests " who crammed into his Belgian-owned hotel , the Mille Collines .

He takes the crises as they come , handles them as best he can and moves on to the next . <P> He is , in short , a very busy fellow , and that may be his salvation . Guns are placed at his head . And sometimes his suppressed outrage bursts forth in angry confrontations . But mostly he is desperately trying to keep his cool and does n't have time to grasp the enormity of a situation in which , finally , close to a million people are slaughtered . It is only toward the end of the film that he realizes the full horror of his situation . As he returns through a dense fog with a truckload of food , his vehicle suddenly starts to bounce alarmingly . He thinks perhaps he has gone off the road . But , in fact , the truck is running over bodies  --  hundreds of murdered men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
