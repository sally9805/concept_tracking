<p> DO N'T expect to hear much from the Democrats in Congress this year about rolling back President Bush 's tax cuts . <p> Do expect to hear a lot about narrowing the " tax gap , " which essentially means cracking down on tax cheats , and about cracking down on exotic tax-evasion schemes . And expect more attacks on the big oil companies . <p> But make no mistake : Democrats want to generate substantially more tax revenue , and much of that is likely to come from closer to home than a tax haven in the Caymans . <p> Hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes are owed to the government each year but are not being collected , said Representative Charles B. Rangel , Democrat of New York and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee . " It 's like somebody saying , you 're in the will , but you 're not going to get the money anyway , " he said . " We 're still going to go after it . " <p> The Democrats in control of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first is their own decision to reimpose " pay-go " budgeting rules . Aimed at instilling fiscal discipline in lawmakers , the pay-go rules require Congress to pay for any new spending programs or new tax breaks with savings elsewhere in the budget . <p> The second reason , in some ways , is more startling : the Democrats ' own tax-cutting agenda . Lawmakers want to reduce or repeal the alternative minimum tax , a nightmarish parallel tax that was originally aimed at the very rich but is now engulfing millions of moderate-income families . <p> Freezing the A.M.T. at last year 's levels would cost $40 billion , just for 2007 . Repealing it would cost $70 billion this year and well over $1 trillion over the next decade . <p> Where might all the money come from ? <p> The most alluring idea right now is to narrow the " tax gap , " a euphemism for cracking down on tax cheats . Based on an analysis of 46,000 audited tax returns from 2001 , the Internal Revenue Service estimates that the government loses about $300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underpay taxes . Of that , I.R.S. officials have said , as much as $100 billion a year could be fairly easy to recover . <p> Who could be against going after tax cheats ? Millions of people , if I.R.S. research offers any indication . <p> The vast bulk of the missing $300 billion , officials estimate , is lost through garden-variety cheating by people who simply do not report everything they earn : self-employed painters and plumbers , small family businesses ( from local florists and dry-cleaners to restaurants ) and the growing legions who sell things over eBay and other Internet auction sites . <p> Another big part of the " tax gap " comes from millions of people who cash in stocks each year but fudge on their capital gains . <p> And while no lobbyist would ever defend tax cheats , proposals to track down the missing money have already met resistance from small-business lobbying groups . <p> In December , before Democrats had formally taken control of Congress , the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business started the Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fend off proposals about the tax gap that might overly burden small-business owners . <p> " Honest small-business taxpayers are especially at risk of being subjected to needless and unwarranted regulatory burdens in an attempt to capture the few ' bad actors , ' " said John S. Satagaj , the Small Business Legislative Council president , at a Senate Budget Committee hearing in January . <p> But the tax gap is about far more than a few bad actors . Rather , the data suggest that most of those who can cheat , do cheat . And that means millions of people . In its analysis of audited 2001 returns , the I.R.S. estimated that the government lost $109 billion from individual taxpayers who underreported business income . <p> Little of this money had been hidden in exotic tax-shelter schemes , and none of it stemmed from corporate machinations . This was income from sole proprietors  --  mom-and-pop businesses  --  and family farmers . Indeed , the overarching theme of the I.R.S. research is that the most pervasive underreporting occurs among people whose revenues are hardest to verify . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate for people whose employers withhold taxes and report their earnings to the government . <p> The accuracy rate is almost as high  --  96 percent  --  for people whose taxes are not withheld but whose income is reported to the I.R.S. by third parties , like businesses that file Form 1099s for payments to other companies . <p> Compliance is similarly high for income from bank interest and dividends , which is reported to the I.R.S. by banks and investment firms . <p> By contrast , the compliance rate plunges to just 43 percent for people whose income is not reported by either an employer or a third party . <p> In practice , that means cheating is most pervasive among self-employed people who earn money from retail customers . Unlike businesses , retail customers do not inform the I.R.S. about payments to people they hire  --  electricians , plumbers , lawn-mowing services  --  or payments to stores and restaurants . <p> That means the government has no independent information on such revenue for family-owned businesses . A full audit can often uncover that income , but the I.R.S. conducts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family farmers appear to be even bigger cheats : an estimated 72 percent underreported some of their income , according to the I.R.S. <p> The Treasury Department has proposed a move to get such information . Under a Treasury proposal last year , credit card companies would have to send the government information about the total volume of credit card payments to individual businesses . If the payments to a restaurant or auto repair shop were higher than what the company reported as revenue , the discrepancy would be a red flag for an audit . <p> Small-business groups have begun to fight that idea , arguing that lawmakers simply do not know enough about the problem and that further reporting requirements might cause unneeded turmoil for businesses without raising much money . <p> Some outside critics of the Bush administration contend that the focus on mom-and-pop businesses misses the point . <p> Robert S. McIntyre , director of Citizens for Tax Justice and a longtime analyst of tax policy , noted that the I.R.S. 's definition of the tax gap is limited to money that people undisputedly owe under existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars through dubious but legal tax breaks , like the indefinite deferral of taxes on foreign profits kept outside the United States , or the use of offshore tax havens by corporations and very wealthy individuals . <p> " If you want to put I.R.S. resources to the best use , you should go after the big guys , " Mr. McIntyre said . " You have estimates of $11 trillion in offshore accounts around the world . If half of that is from the United States , that could be $50 billion in evaded taxes . " <p> Even by the I.R.S. 's narrow definition of the tax gap , President Bush 's budget proposal for 2008 ( sent to Congress on Monday ) envisioned recovering only $29 billion over 10 years . That would be less than 1 percent of the estimated missing money , a goal that Democrats quickly said was inadequate . <p> " We 're not asking for the moon here , " said Senator Max Baucus of Montana , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee . " We 're asking for more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major crackdown on cheating and abusive tax shelters could be overshadowed by the cost of overhauling the alternative minimum tax  --  a cost that Mr. Bush did not include in his budget proposal . <p> Originally created in the 1960s as a parallel tax aimed at millionaires , the A.M.T. is set to ensnare tens of millions of moderate-income families because it is not adjusted for inflation and because it has a perverse interaction with Mr. Bush 's tax cuts . <p> As the tax cuts reduced obligations under the normal income tax calculation , more people faced a higher tax bill as calculated under the alternative minimum tax . About four million people already pay the A.M.T. , but the number would jump to more than 20 million next year if the law remained unchanged . <p> Preventing that increase is expected to cost $40 billion in 2007 and more in every subsequent year . A full repeal of the A.M.T. , without touching Mr. Bush 's tax cuts , would cost $1.5 trillion over the next decade , according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center , a research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brookings Institution . <p> DEMOCRATIC leaders are especially eager to tame the A.M.T. , because it has a disproportionately large impact on the high-income , high-tax , Democratic-leaning states of the East and West Coasts . One reason is that under the A.M.T. , people can not take deductions for state and property taxes . Those taxes are steep in many coastal states , where high real estate prices drive up property taxes . <p> Representative Rangel has made this issue one of his top priorities . <p> But under the " pay-go " rules , any reduction of the A.M.T. has to be offset with spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere . Mr. Rangel has publicly speculated about paying the bill out of proceeds from the tax gap , but even that might not be enough : by 2017 , according to the Tax Policy Center , a repeal of the alternative minimum tax would cost $248 billion . <p> A more likely strategy is that Democrats will pay for reducing the A.M.T. by raising other tax rates . Simply eliminating the tax deduction for state and local taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that , like the A.M.T. , would hit people in many Democratic-leaning " blue " states . <p> As with a Rubik 's cube , the number of possible permutations is almost infinite . But the underlying math is quite limited . <p> According to the Tax Policy Center , paying for a full repeal of the alternative minimum tax would cost the equivalent of a 6 percent tax increase for people in every tax bracket . Another option would be to put the burden entirely on people in the top three tax brackets , those with taxable incomes today above $123,700 ; that shift would be equal to raising their normal income tax rates by 15 percent . For a married couple with taxable income of $150,000 , the tax rate would jump to 32.3 percent from 28 percent . For families in the top bracket , with incomes above $336,550 , the rate would jump to 40.4 percent from 35 percent . <p> In the end , with or without a crackdown on tax cheats , the cost is likely to fall somewhere between those two options. @
