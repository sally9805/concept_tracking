Chapter One THE FAIRIES ' LAMENTaTION The children huddled in the meager protection of the doorway on the Lower East Side across from the homeless shelter . They passed around hoarded cigarettes and drank from bottles of Coca Cola swaddled in brown paper bags in imitation of their elders . None of them was older than eight or ten , but their faces were already hard and set , the legacy of a life spent on the street . Monday was just another day if you did n't have anywhere else to be . School was something to be avoided . Too many awkward questions , too many meddling adults wanting you to get with the program-or into a program . Only a few of them were enrolled anyway . Enrollment required a home address , or a fixed address , and none of them had homes to go to . Not really . In the wake of the unfathomable disaster that had struck New York a year ago , the city 's social services had been stressed even further than before . People who had been marginally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage , and those who had fallen through the cracks were being buried beneath the avalanche of lives falling through what were no longer mere cracks , but canyons in the system . New York these days , as many social commentators had said , was one large enclave of post traumatic stress disorder , and , as always , it was the children who were the invisible and largely-unnoticed victims . For these kids as for many others , home was an single room occupancy or a bed in a shelter , if they still had a family . If not , it was whatever refuge they could find out of the chill November wind . And every one of them already knew that refuge came at a price . Most of them were dressed in hand-me-downs and cast-offs , worn , dirty , nothing quite the right size , nothing quite warm enough for the cold November day . When clothes were so hard to come by , it was better to get something you could keep as long as possible , and not have to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was wearing a new well-fitting leather jacket over a hoodie . The jacket was shiny and cheap , the thin leather already starting to craze and crack , but even so , it marked him out as someone with more resources than his peers . All of them kept a wary eye out for adults , ready to run if they were challenged , but the few pedestrians paid no particular attention to the cluster of young street kids . * * * " Where you been , Elio ? " a very small child piped up-impossible to tell if it was a girl or a boy . " Yeah-you got girlfriend ? " Definitely a boy , this one , elbowing the kid in the jacket with a sly look . Another about the same age , with an even more knowing look . " Nah-Elio 's got a boyfriend ! " " He give you that mad jacket ? " asked a third , with great interest , perhaps wondering if it was worth going that way himself . " Cut it out , guys ! " Elio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and leaning against the side of the building . He stared down at the ground . " I seen her . " " Seen her ? Seen who ? " the little kid asked , not getting the hint . " I seen her . " Elio 's dark face was pinched and pale , and so terrified that it was utterly blank . " La Llorona . " There was a moment of confused silence , as if his listeners wanted to ridicule him , but did n't quite dare . Finally another boy-darker-skinned than Elio-stepped forward . " Yo , dog , you ca n't be just saying her name out like that . " " I seen her , " Elio repeated , looking up into the other boy 's face , sharply , his eyes dull and hopeless . " She 's real . " " Then you got ta say , " the other boy said . " That 's the rule . " Elio took a deep breath . His face twisted , as if he wanted to cry , but when he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my uncle Esai 's place . He had his crew there , and there was like a dozen pizzas , and everything , and he said I could eat as much as I wanted , and he let me watch ' toons on his big-ass television , and gave me a beer and everything . " Murmurs of derision and veiled disbelief greeted this part of the narrative , but nobody challenged it openly . They wanted to hear the rest , the part about La Llorona . " And he had to go out on , you know , his business , but he said I could stay , on account of Mama was working late , and everybody was still being nice to me ' cause Julio got whacked last month . So I fell asleep on the couch , but in the middle of the night I woke up , on account of beer makes you pee , and I went into the bathroom , and ... there she was , in the mirror . " Elio 's voice dropped to a whisper and his listeners drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older boy around the corner of the building . He 'd been loitering , waiting for them to leave before going into the homeless shelter across the street , not wanting to be noticed-the oldest of them might be a good six or seven years younger than he was , but there were at least eight of them , and he knew several of them carried knives . Not good odds if they decided to mug him , and with that many of them , they could swarm him and cut anything off him that they wanted . And besides , the story interested him .... Elio 's voice , thin and shaky , just carried to where he was skulking . " She was all blue , and wearing this floaty stuff , like curtains , and it was all blowing around her , like in the movies when there 's a ghost . And she was crying , only it was all black , like blood , and she did n't have any eyes . " The other children backed away now , as if suddenly afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . There was a moment of frozen silence , and then they all started talking at once , their voices low and urgent , creating a babble out of which a few shrill phrases emerged . " Why 'd you look ? " " Why 'd you tell us ? " " You should n't have looked in the mirror . " " If you did n't see her , you 'd be okay . " Then the oldest boy , demanding . " If you seen her , how come you still alive , Elio ? Everybody know if you see the Crying Woman , you going to die . " No one laughed . " I guess it too soon , " Elio said , shaking his head , in a voice utterly without hope . " I guess I am going to die , just like Julio . She just waitin ' . " " Maybe ... maybe she did n't see you , dog . " The oldest boy smacked the other across the back of the head , and now his voice shook with fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she see him ! She in the mirror , is n't she ? And once Bloody Mary see your face , you gon na die , you know that . She gon na find E. wherever he go , track him down an ' drag him down to hell . She a demon . She got powers . Once she seen you , ai n't no escape . " * * * From his hiding place around the corner of the building , Magnus watched as the boy Elio tried to put a brave face on things , and failed . He hugged himself tightly , his heart beating in fear , watching the other boy . Bloody Mary-La Llorona-the Crying Woman . Now he had a name for the woman he 'd seen . It should have been easy to make fun of what he 'd overheard . Just little kids telling each other ghost stories . Just urban legends , after all . Schoolyard tales . But it was n't quite so funny when you 'd seen her yourself . And if what the rest of what they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting out angrily at his friends . They followed at a little distance , still subdued , and watching him the way that cats watched one of their number that was dying-wary , and frightened , and a little in awe . It was easy to see what was uppermost in their minds . It was n't me . Thank God , it was n't me . Magnus moved cautiously away from the building in the opposite direction , his intention to visit the shelter forgotten . Bloody Mary . He winced . It was like that story he remembered from when he was a little kid , that if you went into the school bathroom alone on a Friday and stood with your back to the mirror and chanted " Bloody Mary " three times and turned around really quick , you 'd see a horrible demon face in the mirror . And ... something ... would happen . He forgot what it was supposed to have been . Something terrible . Maybe there was a movie about it , too . Only this was real , because he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week he 'd gone out walking alone . Ace hated it when he did that , but he did n't care . He did n't have any money , and who was going to bother him except to mug him ? And except for the raggedy kids that did n't have enough clothes to keep warm , nobody wanted what he had . She always worried that he was going to get dragged into a big black car for a " date , " but with his chestnut hair , green eyes , and choirboy looks , Magnus had learned how to deal with that sort of thing a long time ago . Besides , people looking for rentboys cruised under the West Side Highway or down on the Strip , not up in the Bowery , so he figured his virtue was pretty safe . And it was n't like Ace needed help to watch Jaycie . Jaycie slept most of the time , anyway . It 'd been late , maybe two or three in the morning . He 'd done gone out just to do it , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days telling him to do this , do that , be good , behave . Besides , he 'd wanted to be alone . It was pretty noisy back at The Place at night . Most of the kids were up and out , but if they were there , they wanted to party , whether or not they had anything to party with . And he 'd seen her-the woman Elio had talked about . He 'd been all alone on the street-or he 'd thought he 'd been . Then all of a sudden she stepped out from between two parked cars , right in front of him . Tall . Fashion-model tall . And somehow he could see her clearly , even though it was dark and there were n't any lights on the side street . She had n't been glowing or anything ; it was just that somehow she was bright enough to see even in the dark . Pale blue draperies flowing around her , rising and settling , constantly in motion , even though there had n't been much wind . Black tears flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been , and he 'd been so freaked , because she 'd just appeared , out of nowhere , that he 'd barely had time to start getting really frightened when she vanished again . He had n't stayed to look around . He might have been in New York for only about three weeks , but he was n't an idiot . He 'd beat feet back to The Place , and by the time he 'd gotten there , the snapshot image of what he 'd seen-kind of like the Blue Fairy on crack-had fully developed in his head : tall , willowy , eyeless , weeping tears of black blood . He did n't know where she 'd come from , or where she 'd gone , and he did n't care , just as long as he never saw her again . And to tell the truth , even now he did n't want to admit , even to himself , how scary she was . In seventeen years of disappointing experiences , Magnus had learned that the best way to handle things he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things you did n't like , you could pretend they had n't happened , and sooner or later , it was almost like they never had . So he had n't said anything to anyone about what he 'd seen , not even Ace . And he had n't gone out alone again late at night , either . But now these kids said one of them had seen her too , and they 'd all seemed to know about her . Right . He had to think about this , right now , real hard , before he scared himself into holing up in the Place and never coming out . Did that really mean what he 'd seen had been no-shit real ? Or had the whole thing been a goof staged for his benefit ? Magnus considered the idea carefully . No . They had n't known he was there , so they had n't been putting it on for his benefit-and how could they possibly have known what he 'd seen ? Besides , they 'd been little kids , half his age-and kids that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway . The oldest of them could n't have been more than ten . And he did n't even know them . Okay . They had n't seen him and even if they 'd seen him , they did n't know him . Why should they bother to ring his chimes ? That only left the other explanation . The worse one . She was something real . And-if the rest of what those runt losers said was true , too-she was going to find him and kill him , because he 'd seen her and she 'd seen him . Bloody Mary . Magnus shivered , heading for home-or what passed for home these days . Even at its worst , it was still better than the one he 'd left . Even if it was going to kill him . At least when it did , it would kill him on his own terms . * * * The Jacob Riis Shelter in Lower Manhattan occupied what had been-a century before-an upper-middle-class home in what had then been a well-to-do residential district . Times had changed . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoestrings-the aging brownstone did the best it could with what it had to provide : beds , hot meals , and counseling to an ever-shifting population of the city 's poor and homeless . These days , that was a precarious interlocking web of grant money , city stipends , and private donations , less every year , though sometimes there was still a little money for " extras " - the things that shelter director Serafina Macunado knew were n't extras , but necessities , if they were to bring any light and hope into the lives of their youngest clients . Color , creative play , laughter , music . * * * Hosea Songmaker shrugged Jeanette 's strap higher on his shoulder and smiled down at the circle of children who surrounded him . Some of them-those who had been here longest-smiled shyly back . The others regarded him with expressions ranging from shocked blankness to outright suspicion . For the last six months , Hosea had been spending four days a week here , providing " music therapy " to the shelter 's children , a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required no more credential than his New York City busker 's license and a willingness to help . The director insisted on paying him - he made sure that it was a pittance , the minimum he could get away with and still be taken seriously . He enjoyed working with the children , and-since the previous autumn-had found his skills especially needed . Paul and Toni were handling most of his training as a Guardian , and Hosea had been frankly surprised to find out how little there was : becoming a Guardian seemed to be pretty much a matter of " sink or swim .
