<p> If it were n't for Peapod , Shelley Davis , a resident of Bronze- ville on the South Side , would have to drive two miles to a grocery store . <p> " It is not the perfect solution because if we have a craving or need an ingredient outside of the Peapod delivery schedule , we still have to pick up an item here or there , " she said . <p> Davis ' husband , Omar McRoberts , puts in the Peapod order each weekend so the family can avoid spending precious weekend time driving in traffic . <p> Davis is not alone in suffering the inconvenience of not having a nearby grocer , but for 500,000 lower-income Chicagoans the situation is worse . <p> These Chicagoans live in neighborhoods that are part of what 's called the " food desert , " areas with no mainstream grocery stores or supermarkets . And for many of them , the source of food closest to home might well be one of 44 liquor stores certified as either a grocery store or convenience store by the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic is West Englewood , according to a study conducted exclusively for the Sun-Times by Mari Gallagher Research &; Consulting Group . <p> Even neighborhoods that are seeing mixed-income housing and gentrification  --  such as Grand Boulevard and Washington Park  --  are hurt by the **34;1760;TOOLONG dilemma , the study found . <p> In Davis ' case , her family 's dilemma was made more dramatic by the closing of the Hyde Park Co-op Markets store at 1400 E. 47th St. three years ago . <p> The family maintains a membership in the Hyde Park Co-op store at 55th and Lake Park Avenue , but Davis said she considers the prices high and says items are frequently out of stock . Davis also avoids a Jewel-Osco grocery store at 35th and King Drive because she said it is old , dirty and " does n't smell good . " A spokesman for Jewel-Osco said the retailer " constantly evaluates " its stores to make sure they satisfy customers , but declined to say whether the store is scheduled for remodeling . Ald. Pat Dowell ( 3rd ) said she is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood . " <p> Compared with many Chicagoans , Davis and her family are lucky to have Peapod and other grocery options . The Web-based grocery service has no delivery in city neighborhoods where residents have limited high-speed Internet access , and where there is a lack of density , a Peapod spokeswoman said . <p> FOOD STAMPS , GROCERS AND LIQUOR STORES  --  THE LINK <p> The food stamp program  --  which is administered by the U.S. Agriculture Department  --  is considered the federal government 's first line of defense against hunger and malnutrition for the needy . But for the program to be effective , retailers that accept food stamps must be near families that receive them . To create these " distribution channels " for its food stamp services , the USDA certifies retailers . <p> Liquor stores are eligible to accept food stamps ( known as Illinois Link cards or EBT cards ) if they meet the USDA 's requirements . The requirements allow for a bit of wiggle room because they include stores where more than half the revenues come from certain " staple " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four food groups  --  dairy products , bread or cereal , vegetables or fruits and meat , poultry or fish . <p> Yet liquor stores carry a limited assortment of packaged and canned foods , many of which are high in fat , salt and sugar , Gallagher said . <p> The fact that liquor stores are considered food sources by the food stamp program should be addressed by Congress , Gallagher said , " if not for better economic development , then for public health . " <p> REVIEW OF DATA <p> Gallagher 's group conducted a record-by-record review of each food stamp establishment 's official government data and did site inspections of a select sample to determine the type of retailer . In her research , she recoded 120 food stamp retailers as liquor stores . <p> Of Chicago 's 325 food stamp retailers in the food desert , 44 are liquor stores , 97 are a mixture of gas stations , bakeries , convenience stores , dollar stores , pharmacies , big-box stores such as Kmart and Target and other stores not considered supermarkets , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers are classified as mainstream grocers . For the full report , go to MariGallagher.com . <p> Lawrence Rudmann , spokesman for the Midwest region of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service , said the Agriculture Department must follow the law as Congress wrote it , and the USDA does not track or classify stores as " liquor stores . " <p> " People have to have access to a store that sells food if they have food stamps . Unfortunately , sometimes that 's it , " Rudmann said of the liquor stores . <p> Rudmann said the USDA authorizes farmers ' markets as food-stamp eligible , and has done so in Chicago 's Austin and Logan Square neighborhoods . Food-stamp recipients can buy fresh fruits and vegetables with their LINK cards at the farmers ' markets during the summer and fall . <p> SOLUTIONS IN THE MAKING <p> Pennsylvania lawmakers sought to alleviate their food deserts when they created the Fresh Foods Financing Initiative nearly three years ago . The program provides financing to supermarkets in communities where infrastructure 's costs and credit needs are not met by conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leverages capital and encourages public policy to help grocers to move into underserved areas . <p> The program is managed through a partnership among the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development and three nonprofit organizations , the Food Trust , the Reinvestment Fund and the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition . <p> COULD CHICAGO OR ILLINOIS CREATE SUCH A PROGRAM ? <p> Gallagher is starting a program she believes will move the city in the right direction . She is forming a nonprofit sister organization , the National Center for Public Research , to respond to requests for suitable grocery store sites . <p> On the radar is a citywide market analysis that identifies opportunities for mainstream grocers , and pinpoints other areas where grocers are needed to improve public health but wo n't enter the market without incentives .
