Triptych By Karin Slaughter Random House Karin Slaughter February 5 , 2006 Detective Michael Ormewood listened to the football game on the radio as he drove down DeKalb Avenue toward Grady Homes . The closer he got to the projects , the more tension he felt , his body almost vibrating from the strain by the time he took a right into what most cops considered a war zone . As the Atlanta Housing Authority slowly devoured itself , subsidized communities like Grady were becoming a thing of the past . The in-town real estate was too valuable , the potential for kickback too high . Right up the road was the city of Decatur , with its trendy restaurants and million-dollar houses . Less than a mile in the other direction was Georgia 's gold-encrusted capitol dome . Grady was like a worse-case scenario sitting between them , a living reminder that the city too busy to hate was also too busy to take care of its own . With the game on , the streets were fairly empty . The drug dealers and pimps were taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Atlanta Falcons playing in the Super Bowl . This being a Sunday night , the prostitutes were still out making a living , trying to give the churchgoers something to confess next week . Some of the girls waved at Michael as he drove past , and he returned the greeting , wondering how many unmarked cars stopped here during the middle of the night , copstelling Dispatch they were taking a ten-minute break , then motioning over one of the girls to help blow off some steam . Building nine was in the back of the development , the crumbling red brick edifice tagged by the Ratz , one of the new gangs that had moved into the Homes . Four cruisers and another unmarked car were in front of the building , lights rolling , radios squawking . Parked in the residents ' spaces were a black BMW and a pimped out Lincoln Navigator , its ten-thousand-dollar razor rims glittering gold in the streetlights . Michael fought the urge to jerk the steering wheel , take some paint off the seventy-thousand-dollar SUV . It pissed him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last month , Michael 's kid had shot up about four inches , outgrowing all his jeans , but new clothes would have to wait for Michael 's next paycheck . Tim looked like he was waiting for a high tide while Daddy 's tax dollars went to help these thugs pay their rent . Instead of getting out of his car , Michael waited , listening to another few seconds of the game , enjoying a moment 's peace before his world turned upside down . He had been on the force for almost fifteen years now , going straight from the army to the police , realizing too late that other than the haircut , there was n't that much difference between the two . He knew that as soon as he got out of his car it would all start up like a clock that was wound too tight . The sleepless nights , the endless leads that never panned out , the bosses breathing down his neck . The press would probably catch on to it , too . Then he 'd have cameras stuck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him why the case was n't solved , his son seeing it on the news and asking Daddy why people were so mad at him . Collier , a young beat cop with biceps so thick with muscle he could n't put his arms down flat against his sides , tapped on the glass , gesturing for Michael to roll down his window . Collier had made a circling motion with his meaty hand , even though the kid had probably never been in a car with crank windows . Michael pressed the button on the console , saying , " Yeah ? " as the glass slid down . " Who 's winning ? " " Not Atlanta , " Michael told him , and Collier nodded as if he had expected the news . Atlanta 's previous trip to the Super Bowl was several years back . Denver had thumped them 34-19 . Collier asked , " How 's Ken ? " " He 's Ken , " Michael answered , not offering an elaboration on his partner 's health . " Could use him on this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's pretty nasty . " Michael kept his own counsel . The kid was in his early twenties , probably living in his mother 's basement , thinking he was a man because he strapped on a gun every day . Michael had met several Colliers in the Iraqi desert when the first Bush had decided to go in . They were all eager pups with that glint in their eye that told you they had joined up for more than three squares and a free education . They were obsessed with duty and honor , all that shit they 'd seen on TV and been fed by the recruiters who plucked them out of high school like ripe cherries . They had been promised technical training and home-side base assignments , anything that would get them to sign on the dotted line . Most of them ended up being shipped off on the first transport plane to the desert , where they got shot before they could put their helmets on . Ted Greer came out of the building , tugging at his tie like he needed air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending most of his time behind his desk basking in the fluorescent lights as he waited for his retirement to kick in . He saw Michael still sitting in the car and scowled . " You working tonight or just out for a drive ? " Michael took his time getting out , sliding the key out of the ignition just as the halftime commentary started on the radio . The evening was warm for February , and the air-conditioning units people had stuck in their windows buzzed like bees around a hive . Greer barked at Collier , " You got something to do ? " Collier had the sense to leave , tucking his chin to his chest like he 'd been popped on the nose . " Fucking mess , " Greer told Michael . He took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat off his forehead . " Some kind of sick perv got ahold of her . " Michael had heard as much when he 'd gotten the call that pulled him off his living-room couch . " Where is she ? " " Six flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square and tucked it into his pocket . " We traced the nine-one-one call to that phone . " He pointed across the street . Michael stared at the phone booth , a relic of the past . Everybody had cell phones now , especially dealers and bangers . " Woman 's voice , " Greer told him . " We 'll have the tape sometime tomorrow . " " How long did it take to get somebody out here ? " " Thirty-two minutes , " Greer told him , and Michael 's only surprise was that it had n't taken longer . According to a local news team investigation , response times to emergency calls from Grady averaged around forty-five minutes . An ambulance took even longer . Greer turned back to the building as if it could absolve him . " We 're gon na have to call in some help on this one . " Michael bristled at the suggestion . Statistically , Atlanta was one of the most violent cities in America . A dead hooker was hardly an earth-shattering development , especially considering where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I need is more assholes telling me how to do my job . " " This asshole thinks it 's exactly what you need , " the lieutenant countered . Michael knew better than to argue -- not because Greer would n't tolerate insubordination , but because he 'd agree with Michael just to shut him up , then turn around and do whatever the hell he wanted to anyway . Greer added , " This one 's bad . " " They 're all bad , " Michael reminded him , opening the back door to his car and taking out his suit jacket . " Girl did n't have a chance , " Greer continued . " Beat , cut , fucked six ways to Sunday . We got a real sick fuck on our hands . " Michael put on his jacket , thinking Greer sounded like he was auditioning for HBO . " Ken 's out of the hospital . Said come by and see him anytime . " Greer made some noises about being real busy lately before trotting off toward his car , looking back over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michael waited until his boss was in his car and pulling out of the lot before he headed toward the building . Collier stood at the doorway , hand resting on the butt of his gun . He probably thought he was keeping watch , but Michael knew that the person who had committed this crime was n't going to come back for more . He was finished with the woman . There was nothing else he wanted to do . Collier said , " The boss left fast . " " Thanks for the news flash . " Michael braced himself as he opened the door , letting the damp , dark building slowly draw him in . Whoever had designed the Homes had n't been thinking about happy kids coming home from school to warm cookies and milk . They had focused on security , keeping open spaces to a minimum and covering all the light fixtures in steel mesh to protect the bulbs . The walls were exposed concrete with narrow windows tucked into tight little corners , the safety wire embedded in the glass looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted white once upon a time . Gang tags , warnings and various pieces of information covered them now . To the right of the front door , someone had scrawled , Kim is a ho ! Kim is a ho ! Kim is a ho ! Michael was looking up the winding staircase , counting the six flights , when a door creaked open . He turned to find an ancient black woman staring at him , her coal dark eyes peering out around the edge of the steel door . " Police , " he said , holding up his badge . " Do n't be afraid . " The door opened wider . She was wearing a floral apron over a stained white T-shirt and jeans . " I ai n't afraid'a you , bitch . " Clustered behind her were four old women , all but one of them African-American . Michael knew they were n't here to help . Grady , like any small community , thrived on gossip and these were the mouths that fed the supply line . Still , he had to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook their heads in unison , bobbleheads on the Grady dashboard . " That 's great , " Michael said , tucking his badge back into his pocket as he headed toward the stairs . " Thanks for helping keep your community safe . " She snapped , " That 's your job , cocksucker . " He stopped , his foot still on the bottom stair as he turned back toward her , looking her straight in the eye . She returned the glare , rheumy eyes shifting back and forth like she was reading the book of his life . The woman was younger than the others , probably in her early seventies , but somehow grayer and smaller than her companions . Spidery lines crinkled the skin around her lips , wrinkles etched from years of sucking on cigarettes . A shock of gray streaked through the hair on the top of her head as well as the ones corkscrewing out of her chin like dreadlocks . She wore the most startling shade of orange lipstick he had ever seen on a woman . He asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defiance , but she told him , " Nora . " " Somebody made a nine-one-one call from that phone booth outside . " " I hope they wash they hands after . " Michael allowed a smile . " Did you know her ? " " We all knowed her . " Her tone indicated there was a lot more to be told but she was n't the one who was going to tell it to some dumb-ass white cop . Obviously , Nora did n't exactly have a college degree under her belt , but Michael had never set much store by that kind of thing . He could tell from her eyes that the woman was sharp . She obviously had street smarts . You did n't live to be that old in a place like Grady by being stupid . Michael took his foot off the step , walking back toward the cluster of women . " She working ? " Nora kept her eye on him , still wary . " Most nights . " The white woman behind her provided , " She an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a young little thing . " There was a hint of challenge in her voice when she said , " No kind of life for her , but what else could she do ? " Michael nodded like he understood . " Did she have any regulars ? " They all shook their heads , and Nora provided , " She never brought her work home with her . " Michael waited , wondering if they would add anything else . He counted the seconds off in his head , thinking he 'd let it go to twenty . A helicopter flew over the building and car wheels squealed against asphalt a couple of streets over , but no one paid attention . This was the sort of neighborhood where people got nervous if they did n't hear gunshots at least a couple of times a week . There was a natural order to their lives , and violence -- or the threat of it -- was as much a part of it as fast food and cheap liquor . " All right , " Michael said , having counted the seconds to twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing it to Nora as he told her , " Something to wipe your ass on . " She grunted in disgust , holding the card between her thumb and forefinger . " My ass is bigger than that . " He gave her a suggestive wink , made his voice a growl . " Do n't think I had n't noticed , darlin ' . " She barked a laugh as she slammed the door in his face . She had kept the card , though . He had to take that as a positive sign . Michael walked back to the stairs , taking the first flight two at a time . All of the buildings at Grady had elevators , but even the ones that worked were dangerous . As a first-year patrolman , Michael had been called out to the Homes on a domestic disturbance and gotten caught in one of the creaky contraptions with a busted radio . He had spent about two hours trying not to add to the overwhelming smell of piss and vomit before his sergeant realized he had n't reported in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at his stupidity for another half hour before helping get him out . Welcome to the brotherhood . As Michael started on the second flight of stairs , he felt a change in the air . Continues ...
