" How many times do I have to tell you ? Take your foot off the gas ! " It 's 9:30 a.m. on the first day of racing school , and my instructor and co-pilot , Paul Mazzacane , looks as if he 's about to blow a fuse . We 're on a skid pad , a circular track slicked down with water , and I 'm speeding around it so fast that the rear tires lose traction and the car goes into a fishtail . For most folks , this would be the time to let go of the wheel and pray ( which is my instinct ) , but the idea here is to practice the spin so many times that you regain control of the vehicle  --  by steering in the direction of the skid , waiting for the tires to regain traction , then turning the wheel back in the direction you want to travel . At least that 's the concept . After the fifth attempt , my goal is simply to hold down my breakfast and get Mazzacane , normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> So it goes at BMW 's M School , a two-day fantasy camp where amateurs can indulge their inner Jeff Gordon . Driving schools , offered by Audi , Jeep , Porsche and independent operators like Skip Barber , have grown popular in recent years . For automakers , it 's all about branding , creating a vacation-like " experience " around a car . Last summer Chrysler extended its Camp Jeep event to California , luring 3,000 folks for two days of off-roading , and Porsche has started a similar program for fans of its Cayenne SUV . BMW runs several programs at its Performance Center in Spartanburg , S.C . At M School , students race high-performance M3 coupes ( 333 h.p. ) and M5 sedans ( 400 h.p. ) , loaned by BMW as part of the deal ( which includes room and board at a Marriott ) . The requirements : $3,650 , proficiency with a stick shift and an iron stomach . <P> Since all the students think they 're better drivers than they really are , school starts with a lesson in braking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all experts at flooring the accelerator , " says Matt Mullins , one of the instructors , " but how many of you are used to flooring the brake pedal ? " No hands go up , and Mullins proceeds to illustrate how to recover from a spinout , slide through a curve , aim for the apex in a corner and accelerate out . Geared up with helmets , we head out to the skid pad , then move on to a lesson in heel-toe technique : gunning the throttle while braking and downshifting ( do n't try this at home ) . After lunch , it 's on to a slalom course , racing around cones placed in a tight configuration , then an exercise called " rat race , " high-speed driving in hourglass formations . <P> By the end of the first day , I feel as if I 've ridden a roller coaster for six hours . The second day brings no respite . At Michelin 's Laurens Proving Grounds , we take turns on a larger track . The skid pad here is a half-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and you wind up in the weeds , which is where I find myself a couple of times . For the course 's finale , we split into teams and , racing against the clock , tear through a slalom . When my turn arrives , my adrenaline is pumping so hard that I put the car in reverse ( a common mistake , I 'm assured ) . Suffice it to say , my team loses .
