I 'm homer , the blind brother , I did n't lose my sight all at once , it was like the movies , a slow fade-out . When I was told what was happening I was interested to measure it , I was in my late teens then , keen on everything . What I did this particular winter was to stand back from the lake in Central Park where they did all their ice skating and see what I could see and could n't see as a day-by-day thing . The houses over to Central Park West went first , they got darker as if dissolving into the dark sky until I could n't make them out , and then the trees began to lose their shape , and then finally , this was toward the end of the season , maybe it was late February of that very cold winter , and all I could see were these phantom shapes of the ice skaters floating past me on a field of ice , and then the white ice , that last light , went gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone though I could hear clearly the scoot scut of the blades on the ice , a very satisfying sound , a soft sound though full of intention , a deeper tone than you 'd expect made by the skate blades , perhaps for having sounded the resonant basso of the water under the ice , scoot scut , scoot scut . I would hear someone going someplace fast , and then the twirl into that long scurratch as the skater spun to a stop , and then I laughed too for the joy of that ability of the skater to come to a dead stop all at once , going along scoot scut and then scurratch . <br> Of course I was sad too , but it was lucky this happened to me when I was so young with no idea of being disabled , moving on in my mind to my other capacities like my exceptional hearing , which I trained to a degree of alertness that was almost visual . Langley said I had ears like a bat and he tested that proposition , as he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with our house , all four storeys of it , and could navigate every room and up and down the stairs without hesitation , knowing where everything was by memory . I knew the drawing room , our father 's study , our mother 's sitting room , the dining room with its eighteen chairs and the walnut long table , the butler 's pantry and the kitchens , the parlor , the bedrooms , I remembered how many of the carpeted steps there were between the floors , I did n't even have to hold on to the railing , you could watch me and if you did n't know me you would n't know my eyes were dead . But Langley said the true test of my hearing capacity would come when no memory was involved , so he shifted things around a bit , taking me into the music room , where he had earlier rolled the grand piano around to a different corner and had put the Japanese folding screen with the herons in water in the middle of the room , and for good measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of direction was obliterated , and I had to laugh because do n't you know I walked right around that folding screen and sat down at the piano exactly as if I knew where he had put it , as I did , I could hear surfaces , and I said to Langley , A blind bat whistles , that 's the way he does it , but I did n't have to whistle , did I ? He was truly amazed , Langley is the older of us by two years , and I have always liked to impress him in whatever way I could . At this time he was already a college student in his first year at Columbia . How do you do it ? he said . This is of scientific interest . I said : I feel shapes as they push the air away , or I feel heat from things , you can turn me around till I 'm dizzy , but I can still tell where the air is filled in with something solid . <br> And there were other compensations as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , I was comfortably enrolled in the West End Conservatory of Music , where I had been a student since my sighted years . My skill as a pianist rendered my blindness acceptable in the social world . As I grew older , people spoke of my gallantry , and the girls certainly liked me . In our New York society of those days , one parental means of ensuring a daughter 's marriage to a suitable husband was to warn her , from birth it seemed , to watch out for men and to not quite trust them . This was well before the Great War , when the days of the flapper and women smoking cigarettes and drinking martinis were in the unimaginable future . So a handsome young blind man of reputable family was particularly attractive insofar as he could not , even in secret , do anything untoward . His helplessness was very alluring to a woman trained since birth , herself , to be helpless . It made her feel strong , in command , it could bring out her sense of pity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could express herself , give herself to her pent-up feelings , as she could not safely do with a normal fellow . I dressed very well , I could shave myself with my straight razor and never nick the skin , and at my instructions the barber kept my hair a bit longer than it was being worn in that day , so that when at some gathering I sat at the piano and played the Appassionata , for instance , or the Revolutionary +tude , my hair would fly about  --  I had a lot of it then , a good thick mop of brown hair parted in the middle and coming down each side of my head . Franz Lisztian hair is what it was . And if we were sitting on a sofa and no one was about , a young lady friend might kiss me , touch my face and kiss me , and I , being blind , could put my hand on her thigh without seeming to have that intention , and so she might gasp , but would leave it there for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who never married I have been particularly sensitive to women , very appreciative in fact , and let me admit right off that I had a sexual experience or two in this time I am describing , this time of my blind city life as a handsome young fellow not yet twenty , when our parents were still alive and had many soirees , and entertained the very best people of the city in our home , a monumental tribute to late Victorian design that would be bypassed by modernity  --  as for instance the interior fashions of our family friend Elsie de Wolfe , who , after my father would n't allow her to revamp the entire place , never again set foot in our manse  --  and which I always found comfortable , solid , dependable , with its big upholstered pieces , or tufted Empire side chairs , or heavy drapes over the curtains on the ceiling-to-floor windows , or medieval tapestries hung from gilt poles , and bow-windowed bookcases , thick Persian rugs , and standing lamps with tasseled shades and matching chinois amphora that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? it was all very eclectic , being a record of sorts of our parents ' travels , and cluttered it might have seemed to outsiders , but it seemed normal and right to us and it was our legacy , Langley 's and mine , this sense of living with things assertively inanimate , and having to walk around them . <br> Our parents went abroad for a month every year , sailing away on one ocean liner or another , waving from the railing of some great three- or four-stacker  --  the Carmania ? the Mauretania ? the Neuresthania ?  --  as she pulled away from the dock . They looked so small up there , as small as I felt with my hand in the tight hand of my nurse , and the ship 's horn sounding in my feet and the gulls flying about as if in celebration , as if something really fine was going on . I used to wonder what would happen to my father 's patients while he was away , for he was a prominent women 's doctor and I worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to return . <br> Even as my parents were running around England , or Italy , or Greece or Egypt , or wherever they were , their return was presaged by things in crates delivered to the back door by the Railway Express Company : ancient Islamic tiles , or rare books , or a marble water fountain , or busts of Romans with no noses or missing ears , or antique armoires with their fecal smell . <br> And then , finally , with great huzzahs , there , after I 'd almost forgotten all about them , would be Mother and Father themselves stepping out of the cab in front of our house , and carrying in their arms such treasures as had n't preceded them . They were not entirely thoughtless parents for there were always presents for Langley and me , things to really excite a boy , like an antique toy train that was too delicate to play with , or a gold-plated hairbrush. <br> we did some traveling as well , my brother and I , being habitual summer campers in our youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woods and fields , a good place to appreciate Nature . The more our country lay under blankets of factory smoke , the more the coal came rattling up from the mines , the more our massive locomotives thundered through the night and big harvesting machines sliced their way through the crops and black cars filled the streets , blowing their horns and crashing into one another , the more the American people worshipped Nature . Most often this devotion was relegated to the children . So there we were living in primitive cabins in Maine , boys and girls in adjoining camps . <br> I was in the fullness of my senses , then . My legs were limber and my arms strong and sinewy and I could see the world with all the unconscious happiness of a fourteen-year-old . Not far from the camps , on a bluff overlooking the ocean , was a meadow profuse with wild blackberry bushes , and one afternoon numbers of us were there plucking the ripe blackberries and biting into their wet warm pericarped pulp , competing with flights of bumblebees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed the berries into our mouths till the juice dripped down our chins . The air was thickened with floating communities of gnats that rose and fell , expanding and contracting , like astronomical events . And the sun shone on our heads , and behind us at the foot of the cliff were the black and silver rocks patiently taking and breaking apart the waves and , beyond that , the glittering sea radiant with shards of sun , and all of it in my clear eyes as I turned in triumph to this one girl with whom I had bonded , Eleanor was her name , and stretched my arms wide and bowed as the magician who had made it for her . And somehow when the others moved on we lingered conspiratorially behind a thicket of blackberry bushes until the sound of them was gone and we were there unattended , having broken camp rules , and so self-defined as more grown-up than anyone believed , though we grew reflective walking back , holding hands without even realizing it . <br> Is there any love purer than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She had a moist warm hand , and dark eyes and hair , this Eleanor . Neither of us was embarrassed by the fact that she was a good head taller than me . I remember her lisp , the way her tongue tip was caught between her teeth when she pronounced her S 's . She was not one of the socially self-assured ones who abounded in the girls ' side of the camp . She wore the uniform green shirt and gray bloomers they all wore but she was something of a loner , and in my eyes she seemed distinguished , fetching , thoughtful , and in some state of longing analogous to my own  --  for what , neither of us could have said . This was my first declared affection and so serious that even Langley , who lived in another cabin with his age group , did not tease me . I wove a lanyard for Eleanor and cut and stitched a model birch bark canoe for her . <br> Oh , but this is a sad tale I have wandered into . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand of woods through the length of which was a tall wire fence of the kind to keep animals out and so it was a major escapade at night for the older boys to climb over or dig under this fence and challenge authority by running through the girls ' camp shouting and dodging pursuing counselors , and banging on cabin doors so as to elicit delighted shrieks . But Eleanor and I breached the fence to meet after everyone was asleep and to wander about under the stars and talk philosophically about life . And that 's how it happened that on one warm August night we found ourselves down the road a mile or so at a lodge dedicated like our camp to getting back to nature . But it was for adults , for parents . Attracted by a flickering light in the otherwise dark manse we tiptoed up on the porch and through the window saw a shocking thing , what in later time would be called a blue movie . Its licentious demonstration was taking place on a portable screen something like a large window shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience of attentive adults leaning forward in their chairs and sofas . I remember the sound of the projector not that far from the open window , the whirring sound it made , like a field of cicadas . The woman on the screen , naked but for a pair of high-heeled shoes , lay on her back on a table and the man , also naked , stood holding her legs under the knees so that she was proffered to receive his organ , of which he made sure first to exhibit its enormity to his audience . He was an ugly bald skinny man with just that one disproportionate feature to distinguish him . As he shoved himself again and again into the woman she was given to pulling her hair while her legs kicked up convulsively , each shoe tip jabbing the air in rapid succession , as if she 'd been jolted with an electric current . I was rapt  --  horrified , but also thrilled to a level of unnatural feeling that was akin to nausea . I do not wonder now that with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . <br> Did my friend gasp , did she tug at my hand to pull me away ? If she did I would not have noticed . But when I was sufficiently recovered in my senses I turned and she was nowhere to be seen . I ran back the way we had come , and on this moonlit night , a night as black and white as the film , I could see no one on the road ahead of me . The summer had some weeks to go but my friend Eleanor never spoke to me again , or even looked my way , a decision I accepted as an accomplice , by gender , of the male performer . She was right to run from me , for on that night romance was unseated in my mind and in its place was enthroned the idea that sex was something you did to them , to all of them including poor shy tall Eleanor . It is a puerile illusion , hardly worthy of a fourteen-year-old mind , yet it persists among grown men even as they meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
