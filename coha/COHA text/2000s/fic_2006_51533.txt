Many years have passed since the last time we serialized a story in this magazine . But this new planetary romance by Terry Bisson hearkens back to the glorious days when science fiction magazines were really pulps ( experts " definitions of a real pulp mag vary , but yes , they were really pulps then and we 're not , now ) so well that it just felt right to publish this adventure in two parts . So strap yourselves in , cadets , and brace for lift-off as Commander Bisson launches us towards the cloud-covered second planet in our solar system .... <p> ONE THERE SHE WAS : AS BEAUTIFUL as Hall had always imagined she would be , as mysterious , as veiled and seductive .... " Venus . " " How 's that , Cap ? " " " Just talking to myself , Chang . Sorry . " " Roger , Cap . " And please stop with the Cap , Hall wanted to add , but did n't . " What 's our ROD ? " " Rate of Descent , ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmospheric insertion , Cap . " " Right on time . Loosen your collar . " " Collar , sir ? " " It 's going to get hot . " Were the Chinese all so literal ? No matter : everybody knew hot . Venus was 500 degrees Celsius at the surface , under the thick , heat-trapping atmosphere . Which was less than a kilometer below - a sea of white clouds , approaching fast . " Collins , you still have visual ? " Hall asked , switching to open feed . " Affirmative , Venus lander , " a tiny female voice replied from high above . Ever since Apollo 11 , every orbiter pilot had been called Collins . " I 'm carrying a live video feed to both Houston and Burroughs . I hope it looks as good to them as it does to me . " " If they 're watching , Collins , " Hall muttered . Forty , fifty years ago , and the whole world would have been watching . Now , Hall knew , the first Venus landing would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten seconds from atmospheric insertion , Cap , " said Chang . " Nine , eight , seven .... " " Just lost visual , Venus lander , " said Collins . " You 're in . " As if I did n't know , thought Hall , watching the white clouds whip past his viewscreen , thickening to a milky paste , like chowder . Only not so tasty : sulfuhc acid , a bitter froth on the poisonous atmosphere below . Flying blind . They would be blind from here on in . With no visible light penetrating the thick cloud layer , Venus was n't a planet for sightseers . " Temperatures in the envelope , Cap , " said Chang . " Want the numbers ? " " No need . " The heat-shielded nose of the lander , through the windscreen , was glowing a dull red . Dull was good . The lander was dropping and losing speed at the same time . Hall could feel the first stirrings of gravity in his bones , a welcome feeling after nine months of weightlessness , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover 's . " You 're go for final burn , " Chang said . Hall nodded , punched in the CO sequence , and leaned forward to tighten his restraining belts . Beside him , reflected in the instruments , hung the solemn moon of Chang 's broad , serious face . This was it . If the next twenty-odd minutes went well , he and Chang would become the first humans to set foot on the second planet . Venus . For Hall it was the realization of a lifelong dream . He had sacrificed much of his childhood , most of his adolescence , and all of two marriages , working his way through the ranks of the Chinese-American Space Service , to get this berth as Commander of the Venus expedition . For Chang , who knew ? Even though they had slept side by side for nine months in ursa-sleep , as intimate as lovers , Hall hardly knew his Engineer . Just as he hardly knew his Pilot , Collins , who had slept on his other side . Chang had drawn the slot because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it 's appropriate , Hall thought , as he braced against the deceleration . The dreamer and the engineer A mighty roar filled the cabin . The lander shuddered and the white mist rushing past the windscreen turned orange , in a swirl of chemical exhaust . Hall braced his feet against the floor ; Chang did the same , his eyes tightly closed . The burn was vicious . The gentle stirrings of gravity gathered into a brutal punch as the deceleration yanked both men forward against their straps . Then , six seconds later , it was over . The roar was replaced by the faint whistling of the atmosphere . Chang 's eyes were open ; his voice was matter-of-fact . " 1922 kph ; we have 1878 , 1833 .... " " Perfect , " breathed Hall . They had scrubbed off almost 3000 kph , right on target . And the trim little Venus lander was flying . It had been transformed from a clumsy rocket to a sleek , swift glider . Hall waggled the wings , just a little , and grinned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The display projected on the windscreen showed the rolling hills of the planet , 3 7,000 meters below . It was a simulation , of course . No details , only outlines . Hall could n't actually see through the thick , poisonous atmosphere , nor would he be able to see when they emerged into the perpetual night below the clouds . But the planet had been mapped by radar from several orbiters since 1978 , and it was now being remapped in realtime by the lander 's sensors . The contours on the screen showed little deviation from the maps . Somewhere over the simulated horizon line ( already losing its curvature ) was the dry lake bed that would receive their historic first footprints . Bootprints , rather . At 500 degrees , the surface of Venus was hot enough to melt most metals ; but not , he hoped , their thermolite suits or the titanium hull of the lander . " 1355 , " said Chang . " Go for spoilers , Cap . " Cap again , thought Hall grimly as he snapped open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and the speed dropped to just under 1250 - jet plane speed . So far , all go . " Collins , you still there ? " " For another few minutes , Commander . I 'm over the horizon in fourteen , but you 're landing in eleven . Can you see the lake bed yet ? " " Not yet , " said Hall , studying the outlines on the simulation , looking for the oval that had been identified as a dried-up methane sink . " It should be coming over the horizon soon . What 's our temp , Chang ? " " There 's a problem , Cap . I 'm getting some funny readings . " " Funny ? " " We 're at , uh - whoa ! " Whoa , indeed . The windscreen had filled with light , dimming out the display . And suddenly , instead of the slowly shifting lines of the simulation , Hall saw rolling hills far below , dun colored , dotted with dark spots that looked almost like trees . " We 're under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can see ! " breathed Chang . " Me too , " said Hall . But how could that be ? The clouds were supposed to cover a dark soup of superheated carbon dioxide . And yet - there was the surface , a few kilometers below . " Elevation ? " Hall asked . " 7000 meters . Cap , there 's something strange here . " " You 're telling me . Rate of drop ? " " Twenty-two . " " Collins , can you hear me ? This is unexpected . We 're under the clouds , and it 's light . We can see the surface . Can you hear me ? " " I can hear you , Commander , " said Collins . " But I do n't think I 'm hearing you right . " " You 're hearing me right . I 'm looking at the surface of Venus . We 're under the clouds and the atmosphere is clear . And there 's light ! Clouds above . Hills below . There 's the dry lake , just came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clear , and no longer curved . Under a pearl-gray sky . " The atmosphere is much cooler than it ought to be , " said Chang . " I 'm reading nitrogen . And oxygen ! " " Something is wrong with your instruments , Venus lander , " said Collins , her voice already fading into static as she approached the horizon . " XZXZXZXZXZX ready to abort ? " " Negative , " said Hall . Abort meant giving up the mission - and the dream of a lifetime . One burn would send the lander back up , into orbit , to reunite with the Venus Wanderer . There would be no second try at a landing . Not in this lifetime . " Commander , the protocols say abort if XZXZXZX instrument problems - " " I 'm losing you , " said Hall , switching off the open line . He adjusted the flaps and picked up a little airspeed . " Chang , what do you say ? " " Nothing wrong with my instruments , Cap . " " Not about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not up to me , sir . It 's your decision . " " Exactly , " said Hall , turning back to the task of flying the lander down toward the dry lake . " Collins , this is Venus lander . Negative on abort . " " You turned her off , Cap . Remember ? " " You 're right . So I did . Grab your balls and pray . " " Sir ? " " I 'm taking her down , " said the dreamer to the engineer . Hall threw the lander into a long turn . A long , slow , sweet turn . In the thick , if transparent , air , the stubby little craft was handling like a sailplane . It was like flying over the CaUf omia hills on a summer day , even to the trees below . Could they be trees ? Still too high to tell . The lander dropped slowly , too slowly , through the thick air , and Hall had to turn back and circle over the dry lake , losing speed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they could n't be . And Hall had to concentrate on the dry lake : an elongated oval , silver amidst dun-colored hills , straight ahead and only a thousand meters below . Eight hundred , seven hundred .... He switched on open feed . " Collins , we 're on approach . " " She 's gone , Cap . She wo n't be back over the horizon for another hour and a half . This circling took more time than we thought . " Oh well , thought Hall . The landing would n't be transmitted in real time anyway , with Mars forty minutes away by radio , and Earth fifty-five . What was important was the event itself . The touchdown , moments away . First men on Venus . He trimmed and straightened , preparing to pancake down on the dry lake bed . " Cap , I 'm getting another funny reading . " " Funny ? " " The dry lake . It 's not dry - " Hall saw it at the last instant : ripples , waves on the smooth surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lander hit not dry gravel but a shimmering liquid . It skipped , once , twice , then nosed down , enveloping the windscreen in silver spray . " Hang on , Chang ! " The nose plowed under , plunging the cabin into darkness . Then it bobbed back up and light flooded the cabin . The lander was rocking gently , like a boat . " Chang , you okay ? " " Affirmative , Cap . " " What is this stuff ? " It is too thin for molten lead or mercury , and the temp 's all wrong . Could be polymeric water , or water eleven , that funny stuff the Russians claim to have discovered back in .... " " Save it for later , Chang . Screw on your helmet . This thing 's not designed to float , even on funny water . We 'd better equalize pressure and get out while we can . " Both men scrambled out of their barcas and fastened down the helmets of their space suits . Hall turned the valves to equalize cabin pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely started building when the door popped open with a sigh that he could hear even through his helmet . Chang climbed out onto the wing . Hall started to follow when he heard a hissing behind him . He turned and saw the instruments , flashing like casino lights . Water , flooding the chips , thought Hall , as the panel threw off a shower of sparks . He watched with an odd , detatched , uncanny calm as the instrument lights flared and blinked out , one by one . It was an almost festive performance . Marooned . " Cap ! " Chang 's voice sounded strange . It was coming from outside , not through the suit radio . Marooned but still in command . " Coming . " Hall pulled himself through the door and stepped out onto the wing . The gravity felt almost Earth normal . He was not as weak as he thought he would be , after the long months of weightlessness in ursa-sleep . Chang was standing on the wing , grinning . He was holding his helmet under one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shouting : " Cap , the atmosphere ! It 's Earth normal ! " Chang 's voice was faint through Hall 's helmet . Hall 's first impulse was to order Chang to put his helmet back on so they could talk . Instead , he took off his own helmet . " Impossible , " Hall said , the word sounding weak and naked in the open air . Impossible ! He took a deep breath . It was the first fresh air he had breathed in nine months . " Impossible , " he said again , more firmly . " This stuff is aitch-twooh ! " Chang was kneeling at the trailing edge , splashing one bare hand in the waves . Hall knelt beside him but did n't pull off his gloves . It did n't seem right . " It 's water , and it 's only a couple of feet deep , Cap . I can see the bottom . " " I know . " At least the lander was n't sinking . Maybe they were n't marooned after all . Chang was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly feeling foolish . None of this was possible . Not the water , not the air . " At least we 're close to shore , " Chang said . He pointed to a narrow gravel beach edged with boulders , only twenty or thirty meters away . Behind the rocks were spindly , misshapen trees with large orange leaves . Trees . Hall almost , but not quite , smiled . " This ca n't be Venus , " he said . " Sir ? " " This is not Venus , Chang . It 's a dream . An hallucination . " " Not following , Cap . " " Think about it , " said Hall patiently , as if to a child . " Venus with air ? Water ? We 're still in ursa-sleep . This has got to be a dream . " " Does n't feel like a dream to me , Cap , " said Chang . He splashed water on his face . " Of course it does n't , " said Hall . " That 's the whole point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blinked twice , hard , expecting to wake up and see the grubby , smelly interior of the Venus Wanderer . Instead , he saw a narrow beach , only a few meters away , waiting for its first footsteps- But no . Not possible . " Think about it , Chang . Could we really be standing here , with our helmets off , on the surface of Venus ? " " Seems like it to me , sir . " " Seems ! Ca n't you see , this has got to be our minds pretending , constructing a Venus as we sleep . " " Both having the same dream ? How 's that ? " Hall shook his head in exasperation . Were engineers all this dense ? " I do n't know how , Chang . Maybe I 'm dreaming you and you 're dreaming me . Nobody really understands the physics of ursa-sleep . All I know is , we spent nine months dreaming , side by side , you and me and Collins . And we 're still dreaming ! Look around you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Cap . It 's somewhere . " " It 's nowhere ! We 'll wake up , any minute , still in orbit . Or still on our way from Mars to Venus .... " Or lost in space - Hall felt a sudden chill . What if there had been a malfunction and they were spinning off course , the electrics dead , gasping for air in a dying ship , dreaming of a Venus where they could draw at least one more breath - Do I really want to wake up ? As if in answer , his left boot started to slide toward the edge of the wing . " Cap ! " Chang cried . The wing was tipping . Hall was falling . Chang grabbed his arm , then stumbled backward himself , pulling them both off the leading edge . They hit the water on their backs , with a loud splash . Hall felt his space suit filling with cold water , pouring in through the open collar . His boots found the bottom ; it was steep , slippery . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , holding onto Chang 's arm . The water was waist deep . His helmet floated by and he grabbed it . " Damn ! " Chang grabbed for his own helmet , already out of reach , which was tipping and starting to sink . Hall pulled him back , whispering : " Damn . " He pointed at the lander behind them . It was sinking . Two THE TWO MEN watched in stunned silence as the blunt little ship slowly slid backward into deeper water . The stubby wings were awash , then gone ; the water poured in through the open door , then swallowed the door . Then swallowed the ship , until only the orange tail was showing above the tiny sparkling waves . " Maybe that 's what happened to Robbie , " said Chang . " Robbie ? " " RB1011 . The lost robot lander . Maybe the lake got him . Like it got us . " " I do n't know , Chang . Maybe this is some kind of nightmare . " They stood side by side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it came to rest with only the last two feet showing , decorated with the twin flags of the Chinese-American Space Service . Marooned . Hall had never before appreciated the mournful resonance of the word . " We might as well head for shore , " he said , pulling off his gloves and dropping them into his upturned helmet . Dream or nightmare , it was n't over yet , and he was still in command . He turned away from the lander , their last link with Earth-or Mars-and started toward the shore . There were the spindly trees , the orange leaves , waiting . If this is a dieam , Hall thought , it 's a damned persistent one . A steep and muddy one , too . It was hard walking in the waist-deep water . Hall 's boots slipped back one step for every two he took . Finally , a few meters off shore , the mud gave way to gravel . The water was only knee deep . Hall stopped to wait for Chang . Even now , even in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were protocols . They should step ashore together , side by side . First men on Venus , more Cortez than Armstrong - Chang grabbed his arm . His grip was tight , even through the thick space suit . " Cap , look . " Hall saw it too : a man 's face , peering out from behind a boulder . Cold red eyes . Then it was gone . " What was that , Cap ? A dream , right ? " Chang sounded almost hopeful . Hall 's throat was tight with terror . I just looked death in the eye . He shook his head slowly and forced himself to speak . It came out as a whisper . " Do n't think so , Chang . This is no ursa dream . It 's worse . It 's Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge . " " Occurrence , Cap ? " " It 's a story , Chang . A guy is hung , and just as his neck snaps he has this long hallucination . " Explaining it somehow made Hall 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , hours . He even thinks he has escaped . But it 's just the last gasp of the neurons , flooding his brain with images . " " Do n't read science fiction , Cap . " " It 's not science fiction . We crashed , damn it ! " said Hall . He turned in the knee-deep water and pointed back toward the lender 's tail , sticking above the water like a shark 's tin - or a tombstone . " We 're already dead , Chang . We just do n't know it yet . Our neurons are flooded with dopamine , so we think we are breathing , walking , surviving . It 's a kind of mercy . But when we reach the shore , we die . Game over . " " There he is again . " A face was peering out from behind a rock . A man 's face , with a broad forehead , long gray beard , and little beady eyes as red as coals . Then it was gone again . " Wish we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , " said Hall . His terror was gone . He felt only a sort of resignation , a strange eagerness , or at least willingness , to get it over with , whatever it was . " We might as well play it out . Come on . " The two men splashed out of the water , stiff in their bulky suits , side by side . First footprints , thought Hall , as his boot crunched loudly on the coarse sand . And last . He took another step , fully expecting to blink out , to disappear into nothingness . But he did n't . Oddly disappointed , he set down his helmet and picked up a handful of sand . Cool , wet sand . He took a deep breath . The air was warm and sweet . He looked up and saw an unbroken roof of white clouds , gleaming , like pearl . Is this , then , death ? Chang did n't seem-to think so . He was peeling off his space suit . His orange CASS longjohns were wet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves on the spindly trees between the rocks . Unsurprising , thought Hall . As unsurprising as the human face or the water or the air . We build our dreams from the reality we know ; the reality that built us . Our nightmares too , he thought , looking out toward the lonely fin of the sunken lander . " What now , Cap ? " Collins was holding a baseball-sized stone , scanning the rocks behind the beach . Alert . Prepared . The engineer , even in dreams . And I 'm the commander , Hall reminded himself . " Help me with my suit , " he said . " And then - " But what was there to say ? How do you take command in a dream ? How do you negotiate a dream that refuses to end ? He was saved by a tiny female voice . " Venus lander , can you read ? Venus lander ? " Collins ! Hall tipped the gloves out of his helmet and spoke into it , holding it in his hands like a bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God I found you ! Commander , I lost the lander 's signal . I 'm only getting one helmet tag . " " We lost the lander , Collins . I think we crashed . " " You think ? " Back up , thought Hall . " We 're alive , for now . It seems like it anyway . But everything is strange here . We 're out of our suits . " " Atmosphere Earth-normal ! " Chang put in , bending over to shout into the helmet . " Oxygen 19.1 , Nitrogen 77.5 , trace ozone and methane . " And something else - Hall was suddenly conscious of a faint but familiar odor , blowing in from somewhere in his past - " I 'm not reading you , Venus lander , " said Collins . " Are you in trouble ? What am I to transmit to Burroughs and Houston ? " " Trouble ? Tell them - " Hall stopped . Behind Chang , he saw the man 's face again . It was on the body of a horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gray horse with wide sorrel stripes , like a rusted zebra . " Tell them what , Venus lander ? Can you hear me ? " " Tell them - " Hall could n't find any words . The centaur-like creature was trotting toward them , across the sand . Mounted on its back was a woman wearing a white tunic , her long legs bare . Her blonde hair was cut as short as a boy 's , and she was nocking an arrow in a bow . " Chang ! " Chang turned just as the arrow flew . He threw the stone but missed . He yelled something in Chinese , then fell backward , knocking the helmet from Hall 's hands . Hall let it fall and roll away . His eyes were fixed in horror on the little barbed point protruding from the back of Chang 's shoulder , shiny with blood . The woman was nocking another arrow . And there was that strange , familiar smell again - Hall heard hoofbeats . He turned and saw another centaur galloping toward him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Venus lander , are you there ? " It seemed as pointless to fight as to flee . Hall just stood and stared at Death riding straight at him . It seemed the only dignified thing to do . The smell was horse , he realized . A sweet and sour mixture of sweat and manure : he remembered it from his grandfather 's farm in Pennsylvania . " Commander , I 'm losing you ! " the helmet cried from behind him on the sand . Then there was the club , descending toward his head , and Hall 's last thoughts were surprisingly peaceful , almost relieved : So this is how the dream ends . THREE HALL SMELLED HORSE and knew he was dreaming . That was good . It is good to dream . You do n't die in your dreams and you do n't dream when you are dead . Or do you ? He did n't want to open his eyes . He knew that if he did the dream would be over . Instead of the rough plank walls of his grandfather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Venus Wanderer , slick with recycled moisture . Or maybe - nothing at all . It was still possible that he was dead . Probable , even . That everything that had happened since the " landing " on Venus was still going on , narrowing like a stream going the wrong way into a vivid , if not particularly convincing , illusion of life . Whatever it was , he was n't going to push it . Better to keep his eyes closed , pretend sleep , breathe in the sweet smell of horse and barn wood and hay . Better to let the dream run its course . " Cap . " Hall opened his eyes . He saw four centaurs , standing with their eyes closed . Dozing . Sorrel and gray , like his grandfather 's horses . Except that horses do n't have stripes ; or human heads . " Damn , " he said aloud . He tried to stand but he could n't move . He was sitting , tied to something . A tree ? " Cap . " Chang was behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same tree . Back to back . " Chang ! You okay ? " " I 'm marooned on Venus , Cap . I 'm tied to a tree . I 've been shot with an arrow . But I guess I 'm okay . " Hall twisted in the ropes , trying to see Chang 's face . " Are you being sarcastic ? " " No , sir . They pulled the arrow out . It hurt like hell . Then they put one of those orange leaves on it , all chewed up with horse spit . The horses chewed it up . One for you too . " " For me ? " " Your head , Cap . You got clobbered . Do n't you remember ? " " I 'm remembering it all now . If it was a dream , would I remember it ? " " Sir ? " " Nothing , Chang . " Dream or not , Hall was still in command . He shook his head , to clear it . The helmet was lying on the ground between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through a gap in the rocks , Hall could see the lander - or at least its tail , sticking up out of the water . It was like a rebuke . " Where did they go ? " " The women ? " " The amazons , Chang . Whatever they are . " " Oh , they 're women , all right , Cap . When they leaned over I could see down their little dresses . They did the orange leaf thing , then they took off behind that rock over there . " " How long have they been gone ? How long have I been out ? " " An hour at most . Not long . " " And where are we ? " " Somewhere near the lake . They did n't take us anywhere . Just tied us up and gathered the leaves I was telling you about . Gave them to the horses to chew up and spit out . " " The centaurs . " " I did n't know such horses had a name , Cap . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hall studied the four centaurs . Their eyes were closed . They snorted as they slept . Their beards were slick with spit . Their donkey tails swung from side to side . " Solaris , " Hall said . " Sir ? " " Maybe this illusion is being created by the planet itself . As illogical and unlikely as that seems . " " What illusion , sir ? " " The centaurs , Chang . Do you really think Venus is populated by horses with human heads ? Do you really think that 's for real ? " " I do n't know about that , Cap . I 'm tied to a tree . I know that 's for real . I ca n't move my hands . " As if to demonstrate , Chang wiggled his fingers . Hall felt them moving against the small of his back . " Chang , can you feel the rope around my wrist ? " " Yes , sir . This one ? " " See if you can hook your thumbs under it and pull it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And then what ? " " Then get you loose , Chang ! " " Then what , sir ? We have no ship . Nowhere to go . We are marooned here on Venus . " " We 're officers in the Chinese-American Space Service , Chang . We have a responsibility to get free . " " That 's you , Cap . I 'm a civilian employee . " " Quit arguing , Chang , and see if you can get your hands on the rope . " He could . He did . Moments later , Hall was on his feet , rubbing his wrists and arms . Chang was still tied to the tree , looking up and grinning . " What 's so damned funny , Chang ? " " That paste on your head . It looks like a kind of hat . " " Never mind that , " said Hall . " Let 's get you untied . " He was kneeling , looking for the knot , when Chang 's grin disappeared . Hall looked over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was staring straight at him . Little red eyes . " We come as friends , " said Hall . The centaur scowled and brayed : WHOONK ! Little flecks of leaves and spit were stuck to its beard . " I do n't think they understand , " said Chang . WHOONK ! the centaur brayed . The others opened their eyes and joined in . WHOONK ! WHOONK ! " Shit , " said Hall , as the amazons ran back into the clearing . One was nocking an arrow into her bow . The other carried a studded club . " I am an officer in the Chinese-American Space Service , " Hall said . The amazon with the club raised it menacingly . Hall closed his eyes , waiting for the blow . Chang , who was still on the ground , tied to the tree , said something in Chinese . Hall opened bis eyes . The amazon was lowering her club . She nodded at the other amazon , who set down her bow and untied Chang . Hall watched , dumbfounded . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did you say ? " he asked as Chang stood up , rubbing his wrists . " I just translated , " said Chang . " I told them you were an officer in the Chinese-American Space Service . " " So they understand Chinese ? " Chang shrugged . " Cantonese , Cap . I guess . " " Good ! Try telling them something else . Tell them we come in peace . Tell them to let us go . " Chang said something in Chinese . The amazons both shook their heads - which apparently meant the same thing on Venus as on Earth . FOUR The uphills were the worst . The centaurs had a choppy , bone-jarring gait . Hall had a splitting headache . He was riding bareback and his butt was sore . His hands were tied behind him too tightly , and his fingers were getting numb . They had been traveling for what seemed hours through a desolate landscape , broken only by dun-colored rocks and a few spindly trees . There was no trail that Hall could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to know where they were going . The amazons rode ahead , with Chang between them on his centaur , carrying the helmet on his lap . Chang was n't tied ; apparently speaking Chinese gave him special privileges . Cantonese , whatever . The dream continued , unbroken . Hall was beginning to get used to it . The pearl-gray sky , lidded with high clouds ; the dry creek beds ; the thick horse smell of the centaurs ; the frowning amazons with their long legs and bare shoulders . " Chang , " he called out . " Sir ? " Chang dropped back to ride with him . The amazons did n't seem to mind . " Can you tell where they are taking us ? " " No , sir . " " I mean , can you ask ? With the Chinese ? " " Cantonese , Cap . No need to whisper . I do n't think they understand anything we say . They never answer . " " Then why are they treating you differently ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? " " No need to get funny . So they never talk among themselves . " " No , sir . They seem to just sort of know what to do . Sort of like ants . " " It 's Solaris , Chang . " " So what , sir ? " Solaris . Suppose - " said Hall , as his centaur started jogging up a long steep slope . He wished he had stirrups , or at least a saddle , but apparently the amazons - or the centaurs - had never heard of them . " Suppose you were a conscious planet attempting to communicate with humans . How would you do it ? " " No idea , Cap , " said Chang . " Never heard of a conscious planet . " Hall shook his head in frustration . It hurt . He waited until they had reached the top of the hill before continuing . " You would want to appear as something familiar , Chang . You would search through your subjects " brains for a familiar image , and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Amazons , " said Hall . " And never mind how they think . It 's the illusion that 's important . We know for a fact that these are images only ; nothing could live here on the surface of Venus . " " What about the arrow , Cap ? That was pretty real . " " Just stay alert , Chang . Hang onto the helmet . It 's our only chance . " " As you say , sir , " said Chang , riding on ahead to join the two frowning amazons . They had reached the top of the slope . Ahead , as far as Hall could see , was more of the same : desolate low hills littered with stones the size of cars . Hall realized that he had wanted , had wished for , hoped for , and even come to expect something else : a green park , an ocean shore , or even a small town filled with friendly humans , like Bradbury had imagined on Mars . Instead , there was just more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , it had to do with the centaurs " short hind legs . It was as if they were designed to go downhill . Hours later , they stopped to eat . If Hall had hoped for a fire and some sleep - and he had - he was disappointed again . The amazons stripped a few leaves off a tree and fed them to both the humans and the centaurs . " Not bad , " said Chang . The amazons ate nothing themselves . Perhaps they were , Hall thought , like ants . Nobody ever saw ants eat ; all they did was work . He had been allowed off the centaur and untied for the meal , and he ate as slowly as possible , not wanting to get back on . The leaf tasted sort of like toast without butter , the kind his grandmother had made for him when he was being punished . She had served it on a blue china plate and made him sit at the table to eat it . Bread and water . His feet did n't reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stirrups . Disempowering . Perhaps that was what this was all about . But to what end ? If it was Solaris , if it was an alien intelligence , mining and manipulating his consciousness , what did it want ? " Still no communication ? " he asked Chang . The engineer shook his head and ate another leaf . Do they taste better to him ? Hall wondered . The illusion may be different for him , just as the treatment by the amazons is different . Hall tried to remember the end of Solaris , but could n't . He had never read the book and had fallen asleep in the movie . Both movies . XZXZXZXZXZXZX The helmet on Chang 's lap was spitting static , - then a voice : " Commander , can you hear me ? This is Venus Wanderer . Commander , can , you hear ? " " Collins ! " said Hall . He grabbed the helmet from Chang , and shouted intoit : " Collins ! " " XZXZXZX your volume , Commander . I 'm going back over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll try another XZXZXZXZXZX " " Collins ! " Hall shouted . A frowning amazon took the helmet from his hands and handed it to Chang . The other amazon pulled him to his feet and tied his hands behind his back . Too tightly . She pushed him toward his waiting centaur , which knelt , scowling back at him . " That was Collins , " Hall said . " I know , Cap , " said Chang , looking back over his shoulder . He was already mounted , with the helmet in his lap . " Do n't let them take the helmet . " " I 'll try , Cap , " said Chang . " They do n't like it though . " " Who cares what they like , " said Hall , mounting clumsily . " Collins is real . She 's trying to get in touch with us . That means we 're not dead . " Not yet , anyway . " Yes , sir , " said Chang as the centaurs carried them away with their bone-jarring trot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode for hours , or was it days ? Venus rotates so slowly that one of its days is as long as 243 Earth days , and the light never changed as they rode through low hills , spotted with boulders and clumps of the same tree , apparently the only one on Venus , with the loaf-sized orange leaves . Venus . Hall knew better . Yet there it was , all around him . Jarring his spine with every step of the centaur upon which he rode . The smell on the wind was of dust ; the water , offered every few hours from a jar on the back of Chang 's centaur , tasted of mud and dust , and distance , and alien exile . Hall learned to doze with his knees gripping the centaur 's bony back . Chang , he assumed , did the same . The amazons never closed their eyes , it seemed , or even blinked . Their eyes were gray , the color of the sky . Spooky . The amazons themselves were anatomically human , anatomically female , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their short , white tunics . Hall found himself looking away whenever they approached and leaned over . He did n't want to see their perfect little breasts . They were more sinister than seductive . Whatever the purpose of the dream was , if indeed it had a purpose , it was in his power to resist it . And so he did . He found himself clinging to his headache ; it , at least , was real . So was the ache in his thighs and the pain in his butt . He was alive . He was sure of it . If only Collins would call again ! " Chang ! " The engineer fell back to ride beside him . The helmet on his lap was silent . " No word from Collins ? " " Nada , Cap . Zip . " " She 'll call . Keep listening . How 's your shoulder ? " " No problem . That orange leaf is something else . Look . " Chang peeled down the shoulder of his orange CASS-issue longjohns . " Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that is solid melts into air . He dozed . He woke . He dozed again , only to be awakened by a sharp , repetitive pain that extended from the top of his head to the base of his spine . The centaurs were plodding up a long , steep , slope . At the top , Hall expected to see more rocks , more hills , more spindly trees . When he saw the castle , he was relieved . At last ! he thought , then said , to himself , aloud : " At last we 're getting somewhere ! " FIVE A NARROW TRAIL - the first Hall had seen on Venus-angled down a low bluff to a wide plain littered with stones . And one small , stone castle . As they rode down the trail , amazons appeared on the castle walls and watched their approach . Hall counted twelve , standing shoulder-to-shoulder , in twos . From a distance they looked as alike as ants . The castle had seen better days . The stone wall , some twenty feet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the near end , an arched gate overlooked a dry moat . " You see it , right ? " Hall asked , catching up with Chang , who had fallen behind the two amazons . " The castle ? Yes , sir . " " Good . It 's consistent . " How to explain it to this unimaginative engineer ! " An elaboration of the same general theme as the amazons and the centaurs . An illusion constructed from our shared cultural memories , the narrow region where they intersect and overlap . " " You mean the castle , Cap . " " Ever actually seen a castle , Chang ? " " Sure . In movies . My ex-wife was crazy for The Princess Bride . " " Exactly ! Whatever this is , it 's feeding off our shared memories . That 's why it 's so generic . " " Guess so , Cap , " said Chang . " But maybe we should n't be talking . They do n't like it when we talk . " " Whatever , " said Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his crew , even though the engineer was apparently right . The lead amazon , the one with the club , was frowning back at him over her shoulder . I 'm real and you 're not , Hall thought with a fierce certainty . He attempted to stare her down , then gave up and looked away . They rode single file down the path , across the plain , and through the moat , which was muddy at the bottom , and entered the castle through the arch . The amazons were descending from the walls , in twos , climbing down over the rough stones . Up close , they looked as alike as ants . Hall 's centaur scowled and knelt ; Hall took the hint and dismounted , stumbling ; his legs were stiff . An unsmiling amazon untied his hands . His fingers started to hurt immediately , as the blood flowed back to his fingertips . He wiggled them , like a pianist preparing for a concert . The pain felt good . It felt real . The castle was a shabby dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What Hall had been afraid of , he now realized , was that he might be caught in some kind of endless , meaningless loop of illusion , some kind of half-hell . He wiggled his fingers and looked around . The courtyard was strewn with rubble , much of it from the walls , which had been breached and repaired in places . Big hinges on the arch showed where a gate had once hung . Now the arch was just a window , opening to the plain and the distant mountains . Hall 's centaur scowled at him as it was led away with the others to a low wood corral against one wall . Hall scowled back . At the other end of the courtyard stood a small stone tower , about ten meters high , windowless except for a few slits . There was a wooden door at the bottom . Hall felt a club against the small of his back , shoving him toward the tower . Chang was stumbling along beside him , carrying the helmet . Two amazons waited by the door at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other pushed Hall and Chang inside . The door slammed shut behind them . They were alone in the darkness . Hall blinked . Gradually , as his eyes adjusted to the dim light , he saw a long curved staircase , leading around the outer wall of the tower , toward an arched door near the top . I 'm in a fairy tale , thought Hall . The thought was somehow reassuring . Who does n't know what to do in a fairy tale ? " What now , Cap ? " Ghang asked in a hoarse whisper . " Are we still in a dream ? " The sarcasm was gone and Hall could hear fear in the engineer 's voice . Hall took the helmet from Chang and tucked it under one arm , like a football . " Follow me , " he said . He led the way up the narrow stairs , keeping one shoulder against the wall . There was of course no railing . No railings in fairy tales . The stairs ended on a ledge outside the arched door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock when the door creaked open on its own .. " Come in , " said a voice from inside . A high voice . A woman 's voice . Hall stepped in . Chang followed right behind . They were in a wedge-shaped room with stone walls . The floor was covered with mismatched , overlapping rugs . Two silent , frowning amazons stood against the wall . One held a club and the other , a bow . At the far end of the room , under an open window , another amazon sat on a lumpy couch . Her white tunic was trimmed with gold ; no , orange . Her hair was black and she was smiling . " I am Sha-Nee-La , " she said in sing-song English . " The Queen of the Amazons , " said Hall , bowing . " Yes ! How did you know ? " " Just a guess . " Chang was looking at Hall with amazement . Hall ignored him . He approached the amazon queen and bowed with what he hoped was an appropriate mixture of dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to him . The queen offered her plump little hand and Hall dropped to one knee and kissed it . Her flesh was cold , like a lizard 's . " Welcome to Venus , " she said . Hall started to rise from his knee , but suddenly felt how tired he was - from the crash , the capture , the journey . He set the helmet down and sat on the rug beside it . " I am Commander Aeneas Hall , of the Chinese-American Space Service . We come in peace . " " And this must be Chang . " " Lu-Hsun Chang , First Engineer , " said Chang , his mouth hanging open , like a bumpkin 's . " Civilian employee . " " Finally ! Welcome , Dr. Chang ! " The smiling queen waved her little fingers excitedly . The amazons set down their weapons and brought three flagons , then retreated to their positions against the wall . Hall hesitated before drinking . But there is no turning back in fairy tales . It was warm water , gritty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirsty as he was tired ; hungry , too . He emptied the flagon and set it down beside the helmet on the rug . The crossed flags on the helmet reminded him that he had a role to play . He wished he had a uniform , or even a space suit . Anything but his orange CASS longjohns . " We come in peace , " he said , sitting up as straight as possible . " Can you tell us why we are here ? " The amazon queen looked confused . " Why have you summoned us here , oh queen ? What is it you want of us ? " " I knew you would come , " she said . " Perhaps my mentor can explain . My teacher . My guru . Is that a word in English ? " " Sort of . " The queen said something in Chinese , and Chang scrambled to his feet and started peering around into the corners of the room . " What did she say ? " Hall asked , alarmed . Before Chang could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was a familiar , mechanical sound , and at first he thought it was coming from the helmet . Then he turned and saw a small triangular platform , like a coffee table on wheels , rolling out of the corner . It rolled across the bumpy rugs on fat wheels , lights flickering across its surface . Chang said something in Chinese . Hall stared . " Huh ? " " It 's Robbie , Cap ! " said Chang . " RB1011 , the robot lander . The one we sent and lost , eleven years ago . " Chang bent down and touched the lighted surface , which flashed and blinked excitedly . " Finally , " whined the little robot . SIX THERE WAS no doubt . Hall had seen pictures of the robot lander , RB1011 , and this was it , from the flat solar panels to the lighted com-displays , to the three fat tires on pivots , like casters , that gave it a turning circle identical to its length - about a meter . No robots in fairy tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This was a talking robot . It was bumping against Chang 's hand , whirring contentedly as the two talked in harsh nasal Cantonese , like old friends . The queen , Sha-Nee-La , listened , all smiles . Her knees were up under her chin , and Hall could see the little triangle of her orange underpants under her tunic . He looked away , back to Chang and the robot . " What 's he saying ? " he asked . " Oh , sorry , " said the robot , before Chang could answer . " We can , and should , and indeed must , speak English . I was just saying , I have waited and waited for you . I followed your approach , and when I saw that you were going to crash into the lake , like I did , I sent the amazons to find you . " " Amazons . That 's what you call them ? " Hall asked . The robot 's lights flickered , and he rolled forward and then back again , like a little shrug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ladies , girls , does n't work . In Cantonese - " He said something that sounded like a gong , spitting . " And the centaurs ? " " Disgusting creatures , " said the robot . " Venus is not what was expected , Commander . Not what was anticipated . I am sure you have noticed that . Do you mind if I call you Commander ? " " Not at all , " said Hall . A talking robot . Was Pinocchio a fairy tale ? " I hit the water , too , " the robot was saying . " Big surprise , but I was equipped to handle it . These tires provide flotation , a design by-product . I should have warned you that you were hitting liquid . I can see that now . If I had thought ahead properly - " " You must n't blame yourself , " said Chang , stroking the robot 's lighted back . " We could n't have changed course anyway . " Actually , we could have ! thought Hall . But what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore . " Back up , " he said . " Why are you talking with us , RB1011 ? I did n't know you were equipped with a speech program . " " I 'm not , " said the robot . " But I have a very resourceful T &E; program , trial and error , thanks to Dr. Chang . " " Doctor Chang ? " " MIT , " said Chang . " You 're talking with my thesis . " " Queen of schools ! " said Sha-Nee-La , her smile widening . She could n't seem to take her eyes off Chang . " So why did n't you warn us ? " demanded Hall . " That was your purpose . Your mission . " " I was mistrustful , " said the robot . " That 's the same as afraid , or almost . My T &.E; suggested that I would n't be believed . It was all so unexpected . Free water . " " So you let us crash . " " I did n't know you would crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your piloting abilities . " " Afraid of what ? " asked Chang . Dr. Chang . " Of Houston , Dr. Chang . Of Burroughs . I was afraid that if I transmitted what I had found , it would be interpreted as a malfunction of some sort , and I might be disabled by remote . " " He 's right , Cap , " said Chang . " We could have done a wipe from Burroughs . " " Would have , " corrected the robot . " I could n't take the chance . Who would believe a Venus so unlike all our predictions ? " " Who , indeed , " said Hall . He looked around the room at the smiling queen , the frowning amazons against the wall . " So you 're telling me all this is real ? " " I just collect the data , Commander , " said the robot . " I 've been waiting for you to evaluate it . " " Should I get us something to eat ? " asked Sha-Nee-La , waving her hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their weapons and hurried off . " You two space travelers must be starved . " The amazons brought platters piled with meat . Hall was famished , and he ate hungrily . So did Chang . The queen just nibbled . The meat was stringy and tough . It needed salt . While they ate , RB1011 told his story . " As soon as I came out of the water , I saw the amazons riding centaurs on the shore , " he said . " They must have seen my capsule parachuting down . I do n't remember any of that , of course . I was just a sort of dumb terminal . " " Send-only , " said Chang . " My T &E; chip must have been going crazy , trying to process the amazons . All I know is that , all of a sudden , I knew what they were . And I knew what I was . Who I was . For the first time . " " You were conscious , " said Hall . " Yes . Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The robot bumped affectionately against Chang 's knees . " A side effect , " said Chang . " The T &E; chip has a heisenberg loop built in to deal with the unexpected . Consciousness is a quantum effect , I guess . " " Consciousness is an amazing gift , " said the robot . " It almost makes up for being abandoned . " " You were n't abandoned , " said Chang , drawing his knees back . " We thought you were lost . You never transmitted . Not even a stasissignal . " " Transmission was no longer automatic , " said the robot . " Thanks to your T &E; chip , I had become a conscious entity . I had to decide to transmit . And I decided not to , not yet , anyway . I was afraid to . " " So you let us crash , " said Hall . " You are too harsh , Commander . Put yourself in my place . Would you risk being shut down , so soon after awakening ? While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazons strapped me to a centaur and carried me here , to the castle , as a companion for their queen . She thought I was cute . " " You were cute , " said Sha-Nee-La . " And wise , too . " " Thank you , " said the robot . " You see , Sha-Nee-La 's smart . Unlike the amazons , who are stupid . " Hall glanced at the two against the wall . If they had heard , they did n't show it . " So I taught her English , and Cantonese , and Unix . " " Unix ! " said Chang . " Unix is hard , " said Sha-Nee-La . " But symmetrical . " " I told her all about Earth . She was eager to learn . " " What do you know about Earth ? " Hall asked . " You were built on Mars . " " By geniuses from Earth , " said the robot . " Who packed my database . Encyclopaedia Britannica . " " Queen of the waves ! " said Sha-Nee-La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her all about my handsome creator ! " said the robot , bumping against Chang 's knees . Chang responded by pulling them away again . " I was just part of a team , " he said . " I 'm a civilian employee . " " You led the team , Dr. Chang ! I felt bad about not transmitting . Feelings come with consciousness , you know . But of course you know ! My feelings are stronger than ever , now that you are here . " He tried to climb into Chang 's lap , but Chang pushed him away . " So you gained consciousness , " Hall said . " And you went silent . What about your mission ? " " I never forgot my mission , Commander . I decided to try transmitting , after I had been here at the castle for a while . But the transmission program is automatic , not designed to be accessed at will . I searched my chips but could n't find it . I kept hitting loops , and finally I quit trying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You two must be tired , " said Sha-Nee-La , waving her fingers again . There was another , smaller apartment next to the queen 's . It had no door , only an empty frame , opening onto the ledge . There was no furniture , just two rough , gray rugs on the stone floor . An unglazed window in the curved outer wall overlooked the plain and the distant mountains . The two attendant amazons brought in a basin and a jug , and watched while Hall undressed and washed with muddy water . He felt a moment 's embarrassment as he took off his orange CASS longjohns , but only a moment 's . It was like undressing in front of ants . The amazons gave Hall a tunic and sandals to wear and left with his boots and his longjohns . He set the helmet on the floor and rolled up in a rug alongside it . The rug was scratchy like horsehair . There was no curtain to block the light from the window , and Hall wished he had a door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of that mattered as soon as he closed his eyes . SEVEN HALL WAS STANDING on the shore , watching the lander sink . It burbled and hissed as it filled with water . A cold wave hit Hall 's bare foot - and he woke up . He was lying on a stone floor , rolled up in a rug . Chang 's rug , next to him , lay empty . He looked around at the stone walls , confused . Dreams within dreams ? He could still hear the burbling hiss of the sinking lander .... XZXZXZXZXZXZX He picked up the helmet and yelled into it . " Collins , are you there ! ? " " Commander ! I thought I had lost you . Thank God ! " " I thought - I thought I had lost me too ! " " Are you okay ? " " I 'm here , " Hall said . " I 'm okay . Chang too . We 're both in a sort of .... " Then he stopped . Remembering the robot 's fears , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images that were all around him - the amazons and the centaurs , the castle , the amazon queen . She 'll think I 'm mad . She 'll know I 'm mad . " What 's that , Commander ? I 'm only getting one helmet signal . Yours . You say Chang 's okay ? Are you with the lander ? " " The lander crashed , " Hall said . " It sank . " " Sank ? " " Collins , just tell Houston and Burroughs that we made it to the surface of Venus and are apparently still alive , and .... " " Apparently ? " Collins 's voice was fading already . XZXZXZXZXZXZXZXZ " Collins , are you there ? " But she was gone . Even the static was gone . The helmet was silent . Hall struggled to his feet . His knees were stiff . How long had he been asleep ? He dropped the helmet onto Chang 's empty , unrolled rug . Out the window , he saw the same pearl light as before ; the same long low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , invisible in orbit , the Venus Wanderer . At least we 're not alone . Hall felt almost hopeful . He pulled on the tunic the amazons had left . It felt weird , like a hospital gown . He strapped on the sandals and tucked the helmet under his arm . Collins might call again at any moment . He would be ready . He walked out onto the ledge . The queen 's door was closed . Hall knocked once , politely ; then once again , less politely . Then he gave up . Why talk with Chang anyway ? Chang either did n't understand , or worse , did n't want to understand . Hall started down the stairs , the helmet under his arm . He heard a scurrying behind him . It was the robot , rolling down the steps on fat wheels . " Where you going , Commander ? " " For a walk , " said Hall . " Can I come ? " " You seem to be in a better mood , " the robot said , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Hall - past the bored amazons who stood in pairs , staring down into the courtyard or out at the horizon , but never at them , or indeed at one another . " I got some sleep , " said Hall . " That always helps . And I got a call from Collins . " He pointed into the helmet . " The Venus Wanderer . So he 's arranging the rescue . " " She , " Hall said . " And there 'll be no rescue . " " No rescue ? " " We were barely able to get funding for one ship , " said Hall . " There 's no back up . Not on Earth or Mars either . " " I had no idea , " said the robot . " Now I am truly sorry the lander sank . " " You and me both , " said Hall . " So why are you carrying the helmet around ? What can Collins do ? " " Nothing , " said Hall . And everything . " Collins is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ever since we got out of the lander and breathed the air , I have been trying to figure out how much of this is real , and how much of it is a creation of my imagination . " " I do n't understand , Commander . " " Sure you do , RBlOl 1 . Centaurs and amazons , a Venus that ca n't be real - Something is altering what I see . And altering it in accordance with images from my own memory , or imagination . That much is obvious . " The robot was silent for a moment . " But I see it too , Commander . And I do n't have the capacity to see things that are n't real . I 'm not equipped with an imagination . " " You are part of what I see , " said Hall . " A talking robot is not all that far from centaurs and amazons . It 's a pretty common image , from Star Wars and Lost in Space . " " Lost in Space ? " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saying that I might be imaginary too ? " , , , " It 's possible , " said Hall . " " I feel real , Commander . Of course , that feeling is fairly new to me . I have only been conscious for eleven years , eight months , sixteen days and six hours , Houston time . " " So you know the exact moment when you attained consciousness ? " " Not to the minute . It was a process . " Hall stopped and put his elbows on the wall and stared out , across the blank plain . Except for an occasional spindly tree , Venus was as lifeless as the moon . The robot clambered up onto the wall beside his elbows . " So if you 're not imaginary , RBlOl 1 , what do you see ? " Hall asked . " Do you see what I see ? " " I see stones and dirt , Commander . " " And behind us ? In the castle ? " " I can see in all directions at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazons , in twos , hanging around looking bored . Three centaurs , down in a corral . " " There were four . " " They do n't last long here , Commander . I can see their chemical compositions , their temperatures . Eighty-eight degrees Fahrenheit . Does n't that make them real ? " " Only if you are real , RBlOl 1 . " " I wish you would call me Robbie , like Dr. Chang . He created me . Ask him and he will tell you I am real . " " I ca n't get his attention . He 's too busy looking up your little queen 's skirt . She seems real enough for him . " " You are mad at him . " " Would n't you be ? But that 's enough philosophy , Robbie . Let 's go eat . " Things aie changing , Hall thought , when he and RBlOl 1 entered the queen 's apartment . Going from bad to worse . Chang sat next to the queen of the amazons on her lumpy sofa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least . One hand was hidden under her tunic . With the other , he gobbled his stringy meat like a pig . Unlike the other amazons , Sha-Nee-La ate too-in dainty little bites , dabbing at her lips with the hem of her tunic after each one . Hall tried not to notice her orange underpants . Hall sat on the floor with his platter on his lap and the helmet by his side . The robot wedged itself between Chang 's feet , where it blinked and whirred contentedly . " What is in the bowl ? " Sha-Nee-La asked , pointing to the helmet . " That 's his girlfriend , " said Chang , with his mouth full . " Any word , Cap ? " r ' - U-  Hall decided to ignore the engineer 's insolence and insubordination . For now . " I talked to Collins , " he said . He tapped the helmet and pointed up , toward the low stone ceiling . " I told her we were okay . I told her what happened to the lander . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to be called Robbie , " said Chang , glancing down at the robot , which was bumping against his knees . He pulled them back . " And what about - the rest of it ? " " She 's going to call back , " Hall said . " I 'm waiting to hear back from her . Meanwhile , you and I should stay in closer touch . You should be staying in the room with me , next door . " Chang reached for more meat with one hand , and put the other under the queen 's tunic . " I do n't think Sha-Nee-La would go for that . " " You have mission responsibilities , " said Hall . " I 'm aware of that , sir , " said Chang , with his mouth full . Like a pig , Hall thought , getting to his feet and picking up the helmet . He bowed . " Excuse me , but I am very tired . " " No problem , Cap , " said Chang . The queen smiled and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored it and left . Hall stuffed Chang 's unused rug into the window , blocking as much of the light as he could , and lay in the darkness with the helmet by his head He was n't sleepy , but there was nothing else to do . No one to talk to . The helmet could n't send unless it was receiving . Nothing to do but wait . He must have fallen asleep , for he was at the edge of the water , listening to the waves when the water hit his sandals and he awoke all of , a sudden . Sandals ? XZXZXZXZXZXZX He sat up and grabbed the helmet . " Collins ! " " Commander , not so loud . " " Sorry . Where are you ? I 've been waiting for your call ! " " XZXZXZXZX higher orbit , which means I 'll be coming around less often but staying longer . And ZXZXZXZX a stronger signal . " " Good , " said Hall . " I can hardly hear you . " " Commander , what did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment 's hesitation , Hall told her . He told her all of it . He scrambled to his feet and paced the tiny room , holding the helmet in his arms , and told her everything : the crash-landing on the water , the amazons and the arrow through Chang 's shoulder , the trip on the centaurs to the castle . He even told her about Sha-Nee-La , the amazon queen , and RB1011 , the talking robot . When he finished , there was a long , ominous silence . I am mad . She knows it now . " So what do you think ? " he asked , even though he did n't want to hear the answer . There was no answer . " Collins ? " Not even static . She was gone . How long had he been talking to himself ? He stared into the helmet . Had Collins 's call been part of his dream ? No . Her tiny voice had been real . He could still hear it in his mind . The helmet was real . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his eyes , hugging it to him . EIGHT HALL APPARENTLY had the run of the castle , or at least the castle wall . He walked around and around , past the bored amazons , who ignored him . The view on every side was the same : the rock-strewn plain , the spindly trees , and in the distance , low folded mountains . He carried the helmet under his arm . He had no idea when Collins might call again , but he would be ready . He heard a whirring at his feet and looked down . " RBlOIl . " " Robbie , please , " said the robot , bumping at his ankles . " I 've been evaluating what you said , Commander . I want to be helpful . " " What did I say ? " " That all this was imaginary . I do n't think so . If you are imagining it , then I am imagining it as well , and I do n't have an imagination . " " Unless I am imagining you , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one fat tire expertly over a loose hunk of rubble , so that its speed never changed . " And I 'm beginning to think I 'm not . " " Good , " said Robbie , his lights blinking with pleasure . " I was surprised to find I was conscious . Perhaps as surprised as you are . But there it is . I like it . " " I can tell . " " It would be disappointing to be conscious and then find out you were n't real . Consciousness is an amazing gift . " " It has its down side , " said Hall , leaning on the parapet and looking out over the rock-studded plain . " Does n't anything ever happen here ? " " What do you want to happen , Commander ? " Nothing . " Nothing . Anything . " Anything . " Only at night , " said Robbie . " The Dark . And that 's sixteen hours away , Houston Time . " " You 're still on Houston Time ? " " Of course . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's encouraging . That sounds real . " " Thank you , " said Robbie . " That means I 've been here .... " " In the castle ? " " On the planet . Venus . Or whatever it is . " " Six days , five hours and twenty-two minutes . " " A week , " said Hall . " That 's discouraging . " He started walking again , around the wall . Robbie followed , bumping at his ankles . " There are seven days in a week , Commander . " " Almost a week , Robbie . Close enough for analog . I 'm not digital , like you , " " I 've been here eleven years , eight months , twenty days , two hours and six minutes waiting for you . Waiting for Dr. Chang , actually , but I must admit , he 's a lot less interesting than I hoped . I like you better . " " Really ? " In spite of himself , Hall was flattered . " Really . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He 's an engineer , Robbie . Plus , he 's mostly interested in his girlfriend . " " I know . That 's my own fault , Commander . I taught Sha-Nee-La all about Dr. Chang , and I may have exaggerated , because I wanted her to worship him , like I do . " " Worship ? Is that in your chips as well ? " " How could I not worship Dr. Chang ? Especially now that I am conscious . He 's my creator . I have many feelings for him . Feelings come with consciousness . " " Is that why you just whirr and click like an idiot when you 're around him ? " " I 'm embarrassed that you notice , Commander . I admit , Dr. Chang renders me speechless at times . I do worship him . Sometimes I wish I did n't . I never imagined he would be more interested in Sha-Nee-La than in me . That 's the problem with having no imagination . " " You should n't take it so personally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My fault , too , Commander . I wanted her to be appealing . " " And so , I suppose , she is . " Hall reached down and stroked the robot 's back . " The gods and their sport , Robbie . It 's an ancient complaint . " " Is it ? It makes me feel better to think so . That 's why I like taking walks with you , Commander . You are more interesting than Dr. Chang . You have imagination . " " Imagination has its down side , " said Hall . He sighed and looked around the castle . There were two centaurs left in the corral . " Let 's get something to eat . " The meal was the same as always : stringy meat , needing salt . What happened to the other two centaurs ! " Have some more , Cap , " Chang said . He was smiling , eating with one hand . His other hand was hidden under the queen 's tunic . Robbie was bumping against his knees , unnoticed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to get some sleep . " I 'm in Hell , Hall thought . / did n't even die . I just went straight to Hell . The room was almost dark . Chang 's rug in the window still blocked the light . Hall sat on his rug and put the helmet up to his ear . There was no voice , no static . . No nothing . He lay down beside it and closed his eyes and fell into a dreamless sleep . And fell , from that , into a dream . Or so it seemed . Water was lapping at his sandals . He pulled them back . The water was cold . XZXZXZXZXZZXZ Hall sat up , suddenly awake . He picked up the helmet and shouted intoit . " Collins ! " " Commander , please ! Turn down your send volume . " " Sorry . Where are you ? I can hardly hear you . " " High orbit , polar , or almost . My signal is weak XZXZXZXZ fuel cell leaking . I may have to switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't afford to lose you . How much of what I told you did you hear ? " " All of it , I suppose . " Hall lay back down on the rug beside the helmet . " And what did you tell Houston and Burroughs ? " 3 % " Not that , for sure , Commander . Amazons and centaurs ? All that is missing is the unicorns . " " No unicorns , Collins . But the centaurs and amazons are no more unlikely than the fact that I am breathing the air . What kind of readings are you getting from the surface ? " " Nothing , or nothing new . XZXZXZXZXZXZ penetrate the upper cloud layer , which reads as poisonous as ever . I ca n't believe it is that different on the surface . " " I ca n't either , but here I am . Alive . " " Apparently . " " Now you are using the word ! " Hall pinched his cheek , hard . " I 'm not apparent , Collins . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only thing that convinces me I am alive . " " How could you have doubted that ? " " Easy . At first I thought I was having a long , last dream , like Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge . " Know what I mean ? " " " An Occurrence , ' " she said . " Or that movie , Jacob 's Ladder . Or Pincher Martin . " " Pincher Martin ? " " William Golding , the guy who wrote Lord of the Flies . " " I never read it . " " It 's about this shipwrecked sailor who climbs up on this rock and does a sort of Robinson Crusoe . Then XZXZXZXZX all a dream he has while he 's drowning . " " Yes ! That 's it . " Hall finally had someone he could talk to . He lay back down , with the helmet beside his ear . Her tiny voice sounded warm and wonderful . And real . " But we know that ca n't be it , " she said . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dream . " " Thank god ! You 're my only contact with reality , Collins . What about that leaking fuel cell ? " " I 'm working around it . What about Chang ? Is he okay ? " " You mean is he crazy like me ? " " You know I did n't mean that , Commander . " " Chang fits in here like he 's part of the dream , Collins . He 's okay , as far as I can tell . I hardly see him . I 'm ashamed to say that crew discipline has broken down . He spends all his time with his little princess . " With one hand up her tunic . " And RBlOl 1 , the robot ? You say he talks to you . " " Robbie never shuts up , Collins . He has apparently developed consciousness , through some kind of heisenberg loop on his T &E; chip . " " Commander , XZXZXZX XZXZ sound plausible . " " I know it does n't . And the rest of it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do they talk to you too ? " " Thankfully , no . Except for Sha-Nee-La , and she does n't have much to say . " " Maybe I could talk to them , Commander . Do you think they would talk to me ? Could you arrange it ? " " You think I 'm crazy , do n't you Collins ? " " Commander , IXZXZXZXZXZ said that . " " I 'm losing you , Collins . When will you be back ? What 's your periodicity ? " " XZXZXZ irregular . Some XZXZXZXZXZX backup electrics XZXZXZX unpredictable , Commander . " " Do n't leave me ! " Hall said . " Collins ? " But she was gone . Hall got up and pulled Chang 's rug off the window . He stared out at the blank landscape under the pearl-gray sky . When will it get dark ? he wondered . For the first time in years , he felt like crying . Maybe the Dark will end this nightmare . He lay back down and , hugging the still-warm helmet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NINE EAT , SLEEP , WALK . Paper , rock , scissors . " You 're bored , " said Robbie . " I 'm sorry . " " It 's not your fault , " said Hall . He leaned on the parapet and looked out over the stony plain . " What 's out there ? Are there any others ? " " Amazons ? Not that I know of . " " Just as well , " said Hall . He looked around the top of the castle . The amazons stood in pairs , some looking inward , some outward . All with blank gray eyes . " They 're all stupid , " said Robbie . His lights flickered thoughtfully . " But I saw a flying saucer once . " " You did ? You never told me that . " " You never asked . I do n't transmit automatically anymore . Besides , I only saw it once . It never came back . " " Let me know if it does , " said Hall . " I might believe in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Literally . " More scientific than amazons and centaurs , " said Hall . " Might sound better to Collins , anyway . " He put the helmet under his arm and continued his walk around the castle wall . Robbie followed at his heels , scurrying to keep up . " Maybe it will come back , Commander . " Hall laughed grimly . " The saucer ? I 'll believe it when I see it . " " What about the orbiter , Commander ? The Venus Wanderer . Can you see it ? " " Of course not , not from here , " said Hall . " Even if the clouds were gone , it would only be a speck . Less than a speck . " " And yet you believe in it , Commander . And you do n't believe in the things you see . That makes you a scholastic , an idealist , like Aquinas or Plato . " Hall stopped and looked down . " You read Plato ? " " I do n't have to , Commander . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They resumed walking-rolling and strolling-past the bored , blank amazons . " I know that Collins is real , " Hall said , tapping the helmet under his arm . " That 's all I have to go on . " " And me , " said Robbie , bumping against Hall 's ankles . " I 'm real . " " Maybe you are , Robbie , " said Hall , bending down to stroke his back . " You 're interesting , anyway . That 's something . " " Maybe the saucer is real too , " said the robot . " There it is , Commander . Look ! " " A flying saucer , Cap ? Are you sure ? " " Of course I 'm not sure . But I saw it . It came over the horizon and hovered about a half a klick away . " " A flying saucer ! " Sha-Nee-La clapped her little hands . " What is a flying saucer ? " " A make-believe spaceship , " said Chang . " Robbie saw it too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a small house . Or a big car . We watched it for about ten minutes , and then it was gone . Right , Robbie ? " But Robbie was no help . He was blinking stupidly , bumping against Chang 's knees . Chang pushed him away . " A flying saucer , that 's cool , Cap , " he said , tearing off another piece of meat and chewing it noisily . " What does Collins think ? " " Collins does n't know about it yet . I 'm waiting for her to call . " " A spaceship ! " said Sha-Nee-La . " Will it take us to Earth ? " " Sure thing , baby . " Huhl Hall stared at Chang . " It 's her thing , Cap . It 's all she thinks about . " " It does n't give you the right to lie to her , Chang . We 're not going back to Earth . We 're stuck here . Marooned . " " What 's marooned ? " asked Sha-Nee-La " I 'll explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her tunic . " Where you going , Cap ? " " Away , " said Hall , picking up his helmet . " To bed . " Was it that " night " or the next when Collins called ? Hall was losing track . He was dreaming of the waves hissing at his feet , and he awoke to find the helmet hissing by his head . XZXZXZXZ " Collins ! " " I 've been on the horn with Houston , " said Collins . " They were - discouraging . About the possibility of a rescue mission . " " I know that , " said Hall . " There 's no ship . You have to start thinking of yourself . Your departure window closes soon . " " I know , but XZXZXZXZXZXZ . First XZXZXZXZ talk to them . " " Are you serious ? " " It would help me help you evaluate what 's going on . " " Give me a minute . " Helmet in hand , Hall hurried around the ledge to the queen 's door and knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No answer . Hall pushed in . Sha-Nee-La was sitting up with her eyes wide open . Chang was asleep , with his head on her lap . Robbie was blinking softly at his knees . " Chang , wake up ! " " What , Cap ? " Chang sat up , looking dazed . Hall handed him the helmet . " It 's Collins . Here . Talk to her . " " Chang , is that you ? " Collins 's voice was tiny . " Hey , Collins , baby ! It 's me . First Engineer Lu-Hsun Chang . What 's happening ? " " XZXZXZXZXZ what 's happening ? Are you okay ? " " I 'm okay , just like the Commander . " " Do you see the same - stuff ? " ; C " Stuff ? " " Centaurs and amazons . The stuff he sees . " " Yes , you bet . Not the flying saucer , though . " " The what ? " " The flying saucer . Hey , want to speak with the amazon queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello , baby . " " Hello ! " said Sha-Nee-La . " HeUo , Earth ! " " Earth ? " Collins 's voice was tiny . " XZXZXZXZ the orbiter . " " Robbie , wake up , " said HaU . He kicked him . " I 'm not sleeping . I do n't sleep . " " Then talk to CoUins . " Hall took the helmet from Sha-Nee-La and placed it on the floor in front of the robot . It was , he thought , like feeding a dog . " RB1011 here , " Robbie said . " HeUo , Venus Wanderer . " " XZXZXZXZXZX , " said CoUins . " Commander , can I speak with you privately ? " " Of course , " said Hall . He scooped up the helmet and hurried around the ledge to his room , hoping the connection would hold . " You heard them , right ? " " I heard Chang , " said CoUins . " The other voices sounded just like Chang . " " Of course they do ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the accent . That was Sha-Nee-La , and Robbie . " " Robbie ? " " RB1011 . The robot . That 's what he wants us to call him . " " I do n't know , Commander . It 's all just too XZXZXZXZX . Amazon queens , talking robots .... " " You think I 'm making them up ? You still think I 'm crazy , right ? " " You 're the one who thinks you 're making them up , Commander . Remember ? I 'm just trying to help . I 'm trying to give you an objective evaluation . It 's just too strange . " " So what have you told Houston and Burroughs ? " " I told them that you 're both alive . That you 're stranded . That 's all they need to know , at this point . And what 's this about a flying saucer ? " Hall told her . " It was silver , " he said . " It hovered by the trees , as if it was watching me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a long silence . Then : " That 's better , Commander . Much better . " " Why ? " Hall lay down on the rug with the helmet by his head . " You believe in flying saucers ? " " Of course not , Commander , but it 's more scientific . What I 'm hearing is your scientific mind struggling to reassert itself . Taking control , preempting the darker , more primitive images . XZXZXZXZXZXZ a healthy development . " " Never thought of it that way . " Hall hugged the helmet . " Collins , you 're pretty good . " " Thank you , sir . I majored in astrophysics but minored in psychology . I sense XZXZXZXZXZ denial mechanism . " " I like it , Collins . The only problem is , the amazons are still here . I ca n't make them go away . " " It 's not going to happen all at once . It 's a process , Commander . One you have to participate in . I do n't XZXZXZX out of line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on crew discipline . I could n't believe Chang 's tone . " " You 're not out of line , Collins . He 's totally out of control . I 've been way too slack . I 've been preoccupied . " " Understandable , sir . Meanwhile , I will tell Houston about the saucer . That may be the XZXZXZX . " " Whoa , Collins ! What the hell are you talking about ? Houston 's never going to believe in a flying saucer . " " It 's more plausible than mythical creatures , Commander , and if I XZXZXZXXZXZXZXZ the media , it would XZXZXZXXZXZXZX . " " I 'm losing you , " said Hall . " Commander , do you want me to speak with her again ? " Robbie asked from the doorway . " What the hell are you doing ? Eavesdropping ? " " I know I can convince her I am real . " " Too late , " said Hall . " She 's gone . " - To be continued ....      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
