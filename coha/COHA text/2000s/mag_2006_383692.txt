The triple threat is a true fashion icon who can easily go from sexy to demure in the blink of a dress . Jennifer Lopez takes a twirl in the season 's most exquisite couture looks and proves that she , too , is one of a kind // I 'm bleeding ! " Jennifer Lopez announces gleefully to stylists , a world-famous photographer , assistants , her producing partner , her personal publicist-and her husband , Marc Anthony . " I 'm bleeding for fashion ! " If any actress could-or would-shed blood over a dress , it would be Jennifer . Shimmying into a mega Dior couture gown with French Revolution slogans splashed on its Scarlett O'Hara-hooplike skirts , she does n't even bat an eyelash . " You know me-I love all fashion , " she gushes . " But this red Galliano dress makes me feel like I want to run through fire . " Says John Galliano : " The romance and rebellion of this gown is perfect for Jennifer , as she is such a strong yet seductive icon . This dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with real passion could carry it off . She is such an inspiring woman of our times . She is unstoppable ! " Unstoppable-except by a stylist 's pin in the bodice of the dress ( there to cinch it close to her fab figure ) , which nearly slices her arm open . " Couture is dangerous ! " she laughs , ever the good sport despite whatever diva reputation has been placed on her press-pummeled persona . " But it 's worth it . I do n't mind getting battle wounds for this dress . " The gown is a wonder of intricate workmanship-something Jennifer , the designer of her own lines , appreciates . ( Her latest , Sweetface , is full of Lopez-like looks : ladylike lace and velvet mixed with street elements and touches of fur . ) " Now that I do my own collections , I look at the work . There are dresses , and then there are dresses . These have beading on top of paillettes on top of major construction . They 're incredible , elaborate creations , " says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antoinette 's " Let them eat cake , " Jennifer makes this oversize dress even larger than life . Not surprising , really . Whether she 's wearing hip-hop gear , slink , giant sunglasses , or ball gowns , the magic of Jennifer is that she wears clothes with strength and boldness . " Jennifer is a chameleon of style who can capture the street or the red carpet with equal panache , " notes Giorgio Armani , in whose black Armani Priv dress Jennifer looks polished to perfection today . Asked for celebrity fashion inspirations , Jennifer instantly volleys back her icons . " Anybody who 's fearless , " says Jennifer , who 's been singing along to tracks from her first Spanish-language CD , the upcoming Como Ama . Una Mujer ( How A Woman Loves ) , and her next project , a ska-tinged pop album . " Women who 've started their own trends , who do n't care what other people are thinking . I admire Gwen Stefani 's style and Madonna 's . Those two have blazed their own trails . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unique woman who can infuse the sweetest confection with steaminess ( that gray Chanel at the Oscars in 2001 ) and turn the sexiest dress into an almost-demure one ( a near-backless orange Michael Kors at the Golden Globes in 2004 ) . Today , slipping into a violet body-hugging Versace Atelier , Jennifer remembers the hoopla of the infamous green Versace number she wore to the Grammys in 2001 , which never , in her opinion , crossed the line of good taste . " If you recall , " she says , " the chest area was the only sliver of skin showing . If it had no sleeves , it would have been too much . But the response ! Those fashion moments happen by mistake-you ca n't plan things like that . " She goes on to coo over the way Versace celebrates women 's bodies . " What Donatella 's great at is how the fabric fits the body . There 's a fine line between sexy and trashy , " she laughs . " You have to be careful on that . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . They make you feel both special and safe , and that 's a hard combination . " Likewise , Donatella Versace credits Jennifer for carrying off a dress to perfection : " Jennifer has a dramatic personality and a charismatic presence . She animates these dramatic dresses , making them move , dance , express themselves . The combination of this actress and these clothes is electric . She is a very sensual woman . " Valentine heaps similar praise on her . " Jennifer , whom I 've dressed for red carpets and also for her second wedding , has the most perfect aura . She has a profound knowledge of her own body , and she moves with such self-confidence that even if she 's not a tiny size O , she looks fresh , romantic , and irresistible . She gives to couture the personality we all crave-a sexy , ironic approach . I adore her . " As for those size-0 girls , Jennifer , age 36 , is philosophical-and empathetic : " I 've always marched to the beat of my own drum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there , in that " I must be skinny " head-you never know what somebody 's going through . I was much more fanatical about working out in my 20s . I used to get up in the morning at four and work out , but I ca n't make myself crazy anymore . If I eat carelessly and do n't work out for a while , I 'll just call my trainer , Gunnar Peterson , and say , " Let 's work out every day . ' ' " When Jennifer and I speak again a few days after the couture shoot , I ask how she got to this new , shall we say , relative calm-this place where she finally seems secure , happy , even mellow . Husband Marc Anthony , whom she wed in June 2004 in a surprise ceremony , gets much of the credit . " He makes me slow down and eat lunch , which I used to not do , " she laughs . " We have different philosophies . I 've been so disciplined . His process is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a martyr thing because I was raised Catholic . But with him I feel like I should relax and slow down . That 's a first for me . " Ever since the Bronx , New York-born beauty landed her big break as a Fly Girl dancer on the TV show In Living Color at age 21 , her pace has indeed been breakneck . There have been , among other things , nearly 20 movies , 5 albums , a restaurant ( Madre 's in Pasadena ) , 5 best-selling perfumes , and a Louis Vuitton ad campaign . Not to mention two brief marriages ( a year-long one to restaurateur Ojani Noa , which ended in 1998 , and another to choreographer Cris Judd , which ended in 2003 ) , plus two very public liaisons ( one with Diddy , then Puff Daddy ; the other with Ben Affleck ) . These days Jennifer does seem intent on flying at a slightly less harried pace-and under the radar-with Anthony . With the exception of a jaunt to Milan for the Fall 2006 Dolce &; Gabbana show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscars , they have made few public outings as a pair . Privately , however , they seem inseparable , traveling together between homes in Long Island , Los Angeles , and Miami . Even work does n't keep them apart . The duo recently wrapped filming on El Gantante , the story of the late salsa singer Hector Lavoe and his wife Puchi , and Anthony was highly involved in Jennifer 's Spanish-language album . " He 's such a good guy , the kind of person everyone loves , " Jennifer says adoringly of Anrhony . " He lets his talent speak for him ; he does n't feel the need to broadcast . For him it 's all about the music . " So does Anthony have any influence on her current fashion incarnation in the way that Diddy did ( low-rise pants and head scarves ) , or Ben Affleck ( Valentine goddess gowns ) ? " I know the press likes to write that I dress for men , " she laughs . " They can pick the one or two pictures to make their story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . I really dress for me . " Yet , she admits that while Anthony 's not a fashion guy per se , " he has a good eye . He 'll even indulge me and go shopping-occasionally . Then after about an hour he starts saying , " Let 's go to lunch . " Actually , I prefer that . Men who like to shop too much are suspect-not for being gay but for being vain and self-involved . " We 're left to assume , then , that Jennifer is completely responsible for her own everchanging , often daring style , right ? " I just do n't have fashion fear , " she confirms . " I 've always been able to see how many different styles can work . I find beauty in so many things . Being an actress is about being fearless , vulnerable , not afraid to make a fool of yourself . I guess that 's why I 've been able to take so much criticism and not jump off the roof . I 've gone through crazy times , doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me through . Even when it feels like the world 's against you , you have your creativity . " There is , however , at least one instance of fashion fear that Jennifer can recall : being backstage at her debut New York runway show , for Sweetface , in February 2005 . " It was the most nerve-racking thing I 've ever done , " she laughs . " I 'm a performer . I can sing in front of huge crowds . But I was so nervous about my own fashion show . " Will there be a big follow-up to that runway show ? " It was amazing seeing the Dolce show in Milan , " she reflects . " The staging was incredible . But that takes so much work-and money . I have a small company , and we do n't need to do shows every season . Fashion is in my blood whether I 'm on the runway or not . " We could n't have said it better .
