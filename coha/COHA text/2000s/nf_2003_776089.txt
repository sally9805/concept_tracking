THE EVOLUTION OF A MARXIST HOLY-ROLLER // TO THIS DAY , MY MOTHER SWEARS MY father tricked her into marrying him . Laurette Mathieu was a medical student in Li ? ge , Belgium , during the waning days of World War II when she first met Sgt. James B. Henley of the U.S. Army . He was riding up and down the streets of Li ? ge on his army-issue motorcycle , looking confused and lost . The local newspaper had run story the day before asking the citizens of Li ? ge to please assist the Americans in any way possible and Laurette saw this as opportunity to help an American in trouble . // With the encouragement of her best friend , she yelled out , " Do you need directions ? " Sergeant Henley took one look at the attractive young woman calling to him and immediately pulled over to the curb . // My mother recalls that she repeatedly explained the directions while my father feigned confusion , after which he said , " Just come with me and show me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was grateful to the American forces and wanted to help them in any way she could . So she hopped on the back of the motorcycle and pointed him in the direction of the base . // Once he 'd gotten her on the motorcycle , Sergeant Henley had no intention of simply driving this pretty young Belgian woman to the base . He insisted on taking her home-which not only made him look chivalrous , but gave him the benefit of finding out where she lived . From that point on , he became a regular visitor in the Mathieu house , much to the delight of my grandmother , who worshiped the Americans . She was certainly not opposed to having her daughter entertain a Yankee , especially one as handsome and charming as Sergeant Henley . // For the next few weeks , Sergeant Henley came to see Laurette nearly every day , sometimes going AWOL from the base to do it . He told her all about his hometown of Camden , Arkansas , painting it as a perfect little town in the most picturesque part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty and glamour of America , most of which he 'd stolen from the movies : before joining the army , he 'd never been outside of small-town Arkansas . // Although she will admit to having been intrigued by my father 's stories , my mother insists that she had no intention of marrying anyone . She was dating a fellow Belgian medical student at the time and had decided to wait until the war ended before deciding where her future might lie . But my father had already decided his future would include her . // " Laurette , " he told her , " I 've been told that I am being shipped out to the front any day now . " His voice breaking , he told her how he 'd gladly fight and give up his own life if it meant she could have a brighter future . In return , he just wanted one thing : the privilege of being her husband for a brief , shining moment . // Moved by his courage , Laurette was plunged into uncertainty . She told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both promise to leave her alone for a week while she tried to sort it all out . Her Belgian boyfriend honored her request and left her alone . My father also agreed to honor her wishes-and then proceeded to show up at her house for seven days in a row . On the eighth day he showed up at the house to find the Belgian boyfriend sitting in the dining room having dinner with the family . My father stormed out of the house and headed back to the army barracks . // To everyone 's surprise-including my mother's-she jumped up from the dinner table and went straight to the base to find him . Until that moment , she had n't realized the depths of her feelings for him-and now he 'd stormed out , perhaps for good . When she caught up with him , my father did not mince words . " I 'm about to be transferred to the front , " he told her . " I do n't have time to waste . " She could either marry him , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unsure of what to do , but knowing that she did n't want to lose him forever , she agreed to marry him . A few weeks later , after she 'd already become Mrs. James B. Henley , she learned the truth-the mission my father was being sent on was actually a routine exercise with a degree of danger only slightly greater than an army barracks inspection . By the time she discovered the truth , however , she was safely ensconced in the local army housing for young married couples and scared out of her mind . // Sergeant Henley has a different version of the story . To hear him tell it , my mother was immediately taken with the debonair American serviceman who bore a striking resemblance to Robert Mitchum . She fell hard for him and was just waiting to come to the promised land , America . If given the opportunity , she would gladly serve as his dutiful wife and bear him many children , all the while never removing her transfixed , adoring gaze . The way he tells it , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could not wait to get married . // As I grew older and began to realize that my father 's stories were often more fiction than fact , I began to suspect that my mother 's version was the more accurate one . However , one thing still confused me : how could a woman , especially a strong-willed , intelligent one like my mother , be pressured into marrying before she was ready . I remember promising myself that when my time came , I would hold out for true love on my own terms . God would later punish me for this bit of hubris . // My parents were married on October 11 , 1945 , and suddenly my mother found herself thrust into the role of American military wife . Over the next fourteen years , she packed up and moved with him every couple of years-from Brussels to Munich to Heidelberg , Germany ( where I was born in 1955 ) , to Fort Riley , Kansas . Then , in 1959 , my father retired from the army and took his Belgian bride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up . // Camden , Arkansas , was a far cry from the place my father had described when courting my mother . It was and still is like many southern Arkansas towns : quiet , friendly , devout , and mostly conservative , but with an underlying live-and-let-live attitude . When we moved there for good in the late fifties , the chief industry was timber and , thanks to the paper mills , you could smell Camden long before you could see it . // My father had had many years of distinguished army service in both Europe and Korea , but he never did advance past the rank of sergeant for one simple reason : he could not follow orders . Every time his career seemed to be on the rise , he would violate a curfew or go AWOL and soon find himself busted down a pay grade or two . Now that he was retired , his attempts at breaking into the private sector were not much better . Unable to follow directions from his bosses , he found himself wandering from job to job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last-chance domain of the headstrong : he decided to become an entrepreneur . In the early sixties , he bought a gas station near downtown Camden and promptly became a part of the burgeoning American middle class . // My mother was keeping busy as well . My father might have had trouble sticking to one job , but there was another area in which he proved to have remarkable consistency : over the course of twenty years , my parents produced seven children-four boys and three girls . The three oldest , Danielle , Jim , and Bill , were all at least seven years older than the three younger children , Paula , David , and John . I was right in the middle , and my relationship with each of the two groups was very different . With the older set I was the kid sister , always trying to measure up . I never could quite succeed , as Danielle was a beauty queen , Jim was the brain , and Bill was the most popular teenager in town . // But my relationship with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David , and John were still very young , my mother took a job as a nurse to help provide for our family of nine . When that happened , I found myself responsible for getting the younger kids out of bed , making their breakfasts , and getting them dressed for school . Each night , I looked over their homework and made sure they brushed their teeth before bed . I seemed to fall naturally into the role of surrogate grown-up-and I took it very seriously . // I became aware early on that I was not like other kids . Instead of playing outside or watching television , I found comfort in reading about the world beyond Camden and imagining lives different from my own . In the third grade , we had a class project where all the kids were supposed to dress up as their favorite historical figures . Kids came to school that day dressed as Davy Crockett , Abraham Lincoln , and even Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz . I , on the other hand , asked my mom for a white lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first time I began to get the weird looks that would be the hallmark of my youth . // The rest of my brothers and sisters were relatively normal , which made my quirks stand out even more . My younger sister Paula , with whom I shared a bedroom and whose biggest concern was showing off her blond hair to its full advantage , used to bemoan what an oddball I 'd become . " Susan ! " she 'd shriek . " Why ca n't you just be normal ? " I would just laugh because I knew she was right . The evidence was everywhere , like the time in the fourth grade when I went to donate my used books at the school book fair . As my fellow ten-year-olds piled their Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books on the table , I dropped off The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich . // I was always a daydreamer , and reading fed my imagination . On summer days , instead of going to play ball or hang around with other kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the library . I loved the library so much that we 'd walk the two miles there even if it was 100 degrees outside-but then , when we got there , we had to do battle with the librarian . She was a cranky woman , and she would never let me look around anywhere but the children 's section . // As soon as she 'd turn her back , I 'd sneak over to the history and biography shelves and conduct a hurried search for books about World War II . The most fascinating tales I 'd ever heard were my parents ' stories of wartime Europe , so I was forever trying to get my hands on as many books about Hitler , concentration camps , and the Russian front as I could . Not surprisingly , this alarmed the librarian , who once even called my father to complain when she caught me sneaking out of the children 's section . Instead of getting me in trouble , she succeeded only in confusing my father , who could n't figure out what the fuss was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve their worrying for times when someone was in danger of losing a limb , not when they were trying to read history books . // In the fifth grade I managed to sneak a copy of Karl Marx 's writings out of the library . To an idealistic eleven-year-old , the concept of sharing the wealth among all people sounded wonderful . Excited at this new idea , I brought it up with my teacher , Mrs. Booker . " Under communism , " I informed her , " everybody would be equal . There 'd be no rich people , and no poor people . " A look of bug-eyed horror crossed her face . " I work hard for my money , " she said . " I 'm not going to give it away to anyone . " I argued with Mrs. Booker for a few minutes , trying to convince her that she would probably end up with even more money under a communist system , but inexplicably she remained unswayed. // My conversation with Mrs. Booker created something of a ripple in the community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers about our discussion , and the frightful prospect of possibly losing one of its young people to the lure of communism was too much for Camden to take . Some of the mothers notified the church leaders , and the following weekend , the whole Sunday school was asked to pray for my soul . // This would be a common thread throughout my early life : reading would usually get me into trouble . Having never traveled anywhere-save for a seemingly endless two-week , flu-ridden station-wagon trip to Jacksonville , Florida-reading took me out of Camden and into the world . I had always been a daydreamer , and reading took me a step further . The more I read , the more I became convinced that I was somehow being deprived of seeing the magnificent and fascinating places in my books . I 'd had very little contact with the world outside Camden , but my love of reading convinced me of one thing : I decided early on that the quality I wanted most in a man was that he be able to " speak like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven shots at it , my parents failed to produce even one shy wallflower of a child . I used to fantasize that our family was an Arkansas version of the Kennedys , conveniently overlooking the fact that we had no money , political clout , or Ivy League educations . Though we were a big , loving family , we were hardly the Kennedys-in truth , we were more like the Brady Bunch on amphetamines . We spent our evenings crowded around the dinner table , with each of the seven children vying to be heard over the shouting and each willing to offer opinions without the slightest provocation . // But one voice always rose above the tumult-that of my father . During the last ten years of his army service he 'd served as a drill sergeant , shaping up young recruits with a two-step program of yelling and yelling louder . At home , he saw no reason not to raise his children in the same manner . Strict discipline was required in everything we did , from waking up at 05:30 every morning to making up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly home after school and , if there was a need to go out , we were given a rigid , nonnegotiable deadline as to when we were to return . Being late meant a whipping , which was accompanied by the inevitable lecture in which my father insisted he had to whip us because he loved us so much . During these times , he introduced us to the unique army vocabulary-words that might seem inappropriate at a dinner party but later came in handy for me during discussions about Kenneth Starr. // For my sisters and me , dating was pretty much out of the question . Even if we did happen to get a date with a local boy , the thought of having him meet Sergeant Henley was enough to dampen any romantic desire . But when she was seventeen , my oldest sister , Danielle , began seeing Bobby Jo Dickinson , a James Dean wannabe complete with ducktail , tight white T-shirt , and a souped-up ' 57 Chevy. // Because my father forbade any of us from going out on weeknights , Bobby Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horn , and call Danielle at all hours of the night-all of which drove my father crazy . //
