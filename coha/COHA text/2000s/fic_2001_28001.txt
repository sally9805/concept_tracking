USE OF FORCE Shane was in deep REM black . Way down there , but still he heard the telephone 's electronic urgency . The sound hung over him , a vague shimmer , way above , up on the surface . Slowly he made his way to it , breaking consciousness , washed in confusion and anger . His bedroom was dark . The digital clock stung his eyeballs with a neon greeting : 2:16 A.M. He found the receiver and pressed it against his ear . " Yeah , " he said , his voice a croak and a whisper . " Shane , he 's trying to kill me , " a woman hissed urgently . " What ... who is this ? " " It 's Barbara . " She was whispering , but he could also hear a loud banging coming over the receiver on her end , as if somebody was trying to break down a door . " He 's trying to kill you ? " he repeated , buying time so his mind could focus . Barbara Molar . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then just for a moment at a police department ceremony , last year 's Medal of Valor Awards . Her husband , Ray , had been one of three recipients . A crash , then : " Jesus , get over here , Shane . Please . He 'll listen to you . He 's nuts , worse than ever . " Shane heard another crash . Barbara started screaming . He could n't make out her next words , then : " Do n't , please ... " She was whimpering , the phone was dropped on a hard floor , clattering , bouncing , getting kicked in some desperate struggle . " Barbara ? Barbara ? " She did n't answer . He heard a distant , guttural grunting like a man sometimes makes during sex , or a fight . Shane got out of bed and started gathering up clothes . He slipped into his pants and grabbed his faded LAPD sweatshirt . He snapped up his ankle gun , hesitated for a moment , then pulled it out , chambered it , and strapped it on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even looking for his shoes . He was already behind the wheel when he realized he had forgotten that Chooch Sandoval was asleep in the other bedroom . He was n't used to having fifteen-year-old houseguests . He knew he should n't leave Chooch alone . The garage door was going up as he backed out his black Acura . Grabbing for his cell phone , he dialed a number from memory . He streaked down the back alley away from his Venice , California , canal house , as cold beach air slipstreamed past the side window onto his face . Brian " Longboard " Kelly , his boned-out next-door neighbor , picked up the phone . " Whoever this is , fuck you " was the way he came on the line . " Sorry , Brian , it 's Shane . I got called out , and Chooch is still asleep in the guest bedroom . " " Chooch ? Who the hell ... " " The kid I told you I was taking for the month . Sandy 's kid . He came yesterday . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just go over and sleep on my couch . The key is in the pot by the back door . " " Good place , dickbrain . Who would ever think to look there ? " " Just do it , will ya ? I 'll owe ya . " " Fuckin ' A. " Longboard slammed the phone down in Shane 's ear . Shane was now at Washington Boulevard . He hung a left and headed the short distance to the Molar house . When they 'd still been partners , he 'd made this trip at least once a day to pick up Ray , heading across Washington to South Venice Boulevard , through Gangbang Circle , where , once it got dark , the V-Thirteens and Shoreside Crips staged their useless , life-ending street actions , occasionally killing or wounding a tourist from Minnesota by mistake . He shot across Abbot Kinney Boulevard and turned right onto California , finally coming to Shell Avenue . All the way there , he wondered why Barbara would call him . Why not dial 911 ? Of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even though she was scared spitless , she still did n't want another domestic-violence beef in Ray 's LAPD Internal Affairs jacket . He was a thirty-year veteran with a big pension , which another DV complaint would jeopardize . That pension was an asset that was half hers . Still , Shane Scully was the last guy Ray Molar would want to see coming through his door , quoting departmental spousal-abuse regulations at two A.M. So why Shane ? Why not Ray 's current partner ? He guessed he knew that answer , too . She called him because she thought she could control him , use him for protection , then keep him from talking . Also he was handy , only five miles away .... Just like before , he had turned up as the double zero on her slow-turning roulette wheel . When he got to Ray 's small , wood-sided house , he pulled into the driveway behind Ray 's car and jumped out . The hood was warm on the dark blue Cadillac Brougham ; the lights were on in the house . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " he mumbled softly , feeling the cold grass on his bare feet . He moved toward the house , tried the front door and , to his surprise , found it was open . Reluctantly , he stepped into his ex-partner 's living room . Ray 's house always seemed delicate and overdecorated . Too much French fleur-de-lis upholstery , too many knickknacks and hanging lamps . It was Barbara 's doing and definitely did n't seem like the lair of a street monster like Ray Molar . Ray should live in a cave , cooking over an open fire , throwing the gnawed bones over his shoulder . Shane could hear Barbara 's screams coming from the back of the house , so he moved in that direction . He came through the bedroom door just in time to see Ray Molar hit his slender , blond wife in the solar plexus with the butt end of his black metal street baton . Then , as she doubled over , he expertly swung the night-stick sideways , catching her in the side of the head with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baton-fighting tactic taught to every recruit at the Police Academy . Shane stood frozen , as Barbara , her head bleeding badly , slumped to the floor , almost unconscious . " Ray ... " Shane 's voice , a raspy whisper , cut the temporary silence like a sickle slashing dry wheat . " What 's the story here , buddy ? " Ray Molar swung around . He was at least six-four and weighed over two-forty , with huge shoulders and long arms . He had bristly blond hair and a corded , muscled neck . Adding to these Blutoesque dimensions was a huge jutting jaw and almost total lack of a forehead . " Get the fuck outta here , Scully . We do n't need the Boy Scouts , " Molar growled , his pupils round points of focused hatred . Shane had seen that look in the street many times before and had come to fear it . " Let 's just back off , slow down , and give it a rest , Ray . " Shane was moving slowly toward him , not wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ex-partner , but feeling compelled to get close enough to protect Barbara if he swung on her again . When Ray lost control , he could turn instantly murderous . He spewed white rage without thought , violence without reason . " You got anything to eat ? " Shane said , trying to refocus the energy in the room . " I 'm starved . Missed dinner . How bout I get us a beer and a sandwich , something .... We chill out a little ... Cool out ... Talk it down ... Get solid ... " " You wan na eat somethin ' ? Eat shit , Scully ! " He was halfway between Shane and Barbara , still brandishing the black metal police baton . " Ray , I do n't want trouble , but you ca n't go hitting Barbara with the nightstick , man . You 're gon na fuck her up bad . " Then Ray started toward Shane , swinging the metal stick in a lose arc in front of him . " Yeah ? Who 's gon na stop me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosty here , Ray . Let 's ... let 's " And he stopped talking because he had to duck . Ray swung the nightstick . It zipped through the air an inch from Shane 's ear . As he was coming back up , Ray swung a fist , hitting him with a left hook that landed on Shane 's right temple , exploding like a pipe bomb , sending him to the floor , ears ringing . Then Ray yanked a small-caliber snubby out of his waistband . It looked to Shane like an off-brand piece , a European handgun of some kind , maybe a Titan Tiger or an Arminus .38 , definitely not standard police issue . Ray always kept a " throw-down gun " on him to drop by a body if some street character got funky and had to take a seat on the sky bus . " Put it away , Ray . " " You fucking this bitch , too ? You fucking her ? ' Cause if you ai n't , you should get in lineeverybody else is . " " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched your wife ; nobody 's messin ' with Barb , and you know it . Why 're you doin ' this ? " " She 's been getting snaked by half the fuckin ' department . " He turned back and glowered at her . " Am I right , baby ? Tell him ' bout all the wall jobs you been doin ' in the division garage . " Barbara groaned . Ray , turning now , aimed the gun at Shane , pulling the hammer back . Shane watched the cylinder begin to rotate on the center post as Ray applied pressure on the trigger . He was strangely mesmerized by the hole in the barrel ; a dark eye of damnation , freezing his stomach , dulling his reactions . He was seconds from death .... Almost without realizing it , his right hand slipped down to his ankle , fingers encircling the wood-checked grip of his 9mm automatic . He slid the weapon free . Shane dove sideways just as Ray fired . The bullet thunked into the wooden doorframe behind him . Shane was operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , going with it , not questioning , rolling , coming up prone , his Beretta Mini-Cougar gripped in both hands . As Ray turned to fire again , Shane squeezed the trigger . The bullet hit Ray Molar in the middle of his simian brow . Huge head jerking back violently . Brainpan exploding , catching the 9mm slug . Then Ray looked directly at Shane as the gun slipped from his meaty paw and thumped onto the carpet . Ray 's pig eyes , bright in that instant , registered hatred and surprise , or maybe Shane was just looking for something human in all that animal ferocity . Ray Molar took one uncertain step backward and sat on the edge of the bed . Even though his heart was probably still beating , Shane knew that his ex-partner was already dead . But the street monster sat down anyway , almost as if he needed a moment to consider what he should do next or where he should go , momentum and gravity making the decision for him , toppling him forward , thudding him hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Barbara , who was staring at her dead husband , her mouth agape , her puffed lip split and bleeding . " Whatta we do now , Shane ? " she finally asked .
