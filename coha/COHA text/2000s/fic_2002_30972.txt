WEEK ONE : GIRL MEETS BOY Chapter 1 : THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM They 're probably going to announce who got what part . " Mikey spoke against background cafeteria sounds of talk and laughter , clattering dishes , and scraping chairs . " In assembly , " she said . " In ... " she looked at her watch , compared it with the clock on the wall , " twenty minutes , or maybe fifteen . Are you nervous ? " Mikey Elsinger and Margalo Epps claimed to have been best friends since the first day of fifth grade , which was n't exactly true . It could have been if they had been willing to modify their claim with an almost  --  best friends since almost the first day  --  but neither one of them wanted to be modified , or to be a modifier , either . " Why did you try out for the play , anyway ? " Mikey asked . Margalo was n't the kind of person who tried to get people to notice her by putting herself up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What had gotten into her ? Margalo said , " It 's Jennet Jourdemayne , " which explained nothing to anybody other than herself , but Margalo did n't intend anybody to learn her secret reason , not even Mikey . Especially since Mikey was the last person who 'd sympathize . " It 's because I told you last year you were a good actress . " Margalo welcomed the wrong guess . It was bad enough having this horrible hopeless crush on a teacher , but it would be ten times worse if anybody found out about it . And what if he found out about how she felt ? Margalo 's whole body blushed hot at that thought . It was n't as if she did n't know that no healthy-minded grown-up man would want a fourteen-year-old girlfriend , even if he wasn'talready married . She knew that . But she still hoped , and she could n't believe how stupid that was . But as long as nobody knew  --  absolutely nobody , not even Aurora  --  and Margalo trusted her mother , but she still was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was the only one who knew , she was safe . So Margalo did n't tell Mikey that her guess was way off . But neither did she say it was right on . Instead , she looked mysterious , with a little smile that almost admitted it matched by eyebrows that absolutely denied it . In fact , Margalo was enjoying herself . Even if the secret you know is about yourself  --  and mostly just makes you miserable  --  still , knowing something nobody else even suspects will increase your self-confidence . Secrets are like that . Besides , it is n't every day you can use the same facial expression to irritate somebody twice . Mikey knew this trick of Margalo 's . She took a gloppy spoonful of chocolate pudding into her mouth , closed her lips firmly , and stared back at her friend while she pushed pudding out between her teeth , then sucked it back onto her tongue , then swallowed it . Margalo counterpunched . She peeled back the skin on her banana , peeling it down carefully , strip by strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way down at each peeling , carefully rotating the banana as she carefully , methodically , peeled it . They played out their two-man scene to their audience of two until Mikey got bored , and broke eye contact , and groused , " Next thing , you 'll be going to the dance . With a date . " Margalo knew better . " I 'm not even invited to parties . " " Yeah , but neither am I , and I 'm a good athlete . " Then Mikey wondered , " We do n't want to be invited to their parties , do we ? Do you ? I do n't . The stuff that goes on  --  " " Definitely squalid , " Margalo agreed . Mikey and Margalo tended to agree about things . Their quarrels were mostly for style , not substance . They had them because otherwise life would be too tedious , and discouraging . From the start junior high had been bad , and this year it had only gotten worse . In eighth grade school seemed to be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered a lot of territory . There were crushes , for one , or a girl would have a thing about a boy . Boys liked girls . Boys and girls really liked one another , or really cared for , really cared about one another . But was it love ? Mikey and Margalo had discussed it  --  of course . Their level of accomplishment in **38;617;TOOLONG was the same : Never been on a date , never been kissed . It was their attitudes that differed . Mikey was mostly outraged  --  What 's the big deal ? Who cares ? Whereas Margalo projected scientific detachment  --  Are n't human beings bizarre creatures ? They had their different attitudes and they each liked having the differing attitudes they had , while at the same time they both agreed that nobody understood either sex or love . But was n't it curious , as Margalo pointed out , that there was a sex-ed unit in gym , but no love-ed unit in any other class ? They also agreed that they did n't plan to be kept ignorant . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not knowing something . Not knowing something always put you at a disadvantage , in Mikey 's opinion , and that was not where she cared to be . But it was n't easy to find out anything about sex , or love , or everything-in-between , especially if you were n't invited to parties . That meant you had to get your field information from secondary sources , and it was Margalo 's opinion that people often avoided telling the truth , especially the whole truth and nothing but , about those subjects . As far as they could tell , the parties seemed to be about slow dancing , close dancing , and long bouts of kissing in darkened rooms . They were about almost getting caught by parents . At the parties maybe there was beer , maybe pot , probably cigarettes , so you could learn how to drink stuff and smoke stuff , things you needed to know for high school . Maybe you 'd get fallen in love with at a party  --  and everybody wanted a chance to get fallen in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikey and Margalo collected stories about the parties , and rumors , and reports , and they considered them . " I do n't believe her , do you ? " Margalo would ask , while Mikey fulminated , " Catch me . " Another useful source of information was Mikey 's mother , the ex-Mrs . Elsinger , once again Ms. Barcley . Margalo had elevated Ms. Barcley to an educational experience , so she kept herself current with what Mikey 's mother was getting up to , at work , at play . " Did you talk to your mother this weekend ? " she asked . " I was watching the Australian Open . " This did not interest Margalo . She 'd already heard her fill on that topic from Mikey . Also , it did not answer her question . " But did you talk to her ? " " She 's still crazy about this new boyfriend . " " She 's always crazy about them , is n't she ? " " It 's just my father she could n't be in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these boyfriends have been rich and ambitious and already successful , which your dad just is n't . If you think about them , they drive late-model cars , dress in suits and polish their shoes . They take her to four-star restaurants , they take her away for fancy weekends  --  your dad did n't do any of those things . " " I just wish she did n't make me meet them . " " Mudpies , Mikey . You 're always talking about the places you eat at . " " Besides , this one 's much older than she is . " Margalo stared at her friend , who was being the same person she had always been , irritable and impatient and self-confident . Who cares ? about summed up Mikey , in a plaid flannel men 's shirt ( a new fashion low for Mikey ) and her baggy cargo pants ( a long-gone style , but Mikey either had n't noticed that or  --  more likely  --  did n't care ) . Not noticing things was a big part of Mikey , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her friend , and sometimes she was really grateful for it . Like now , in the matter of this ... thing that was such a big secret part of Margalo 's life , ruining it and making it wonderful . After a minute of staring she told Mikey , " People can love people who are older than them , " adding for safety , " or younger . " " What do you know about it ? " Mikey demanded . " More than you think , " Margalo answered . " And what 's that supposed to mean ? " Mikey demanded . Margalo was n't about to answer that question . Instead , she said , " Your mother keeps having serious relationships . Do you think she 's having sex with all of them ? Do you think she 's in love with all of them ? " " Dad has n't had even one girlfriend , " Mikey said . " I do n't think you can fall in love that often , " Margalo decided . " He 's been fixed up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a party to meet . But he has n't been on a date he asked someone out on , " Mikey said . " Not a date of his own . " " Not really in love , " Margalo said . " Do you think there 's something wrong with him ? " Mikey asked . " I think there 's something wrong with her , " Margalo said . " You know , you probably wo n't get the part , " Mikey said . " Jennet Whoever . " " Thank you for your kind wishes . " " Get real , Margalo . Do you expect me to want you to ? You know that if you 're in the play , you 'll be rehearsing all the time , from now until the performance . Which is n't until May . " " But you 're in basketball anyway , or tennis , so why should you care ? " " Because if you 're rehearsing , who 'll sell our Chez ME cookies ? " Last year , after the success of Mikey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had continued baking and selling cookies . They liked being in business . Margalo welcomed the income and Mikey welcomed the work . It did n't suit Mikey 's plans to have Margalo be unavailable for the spring cookie business . " And you wo n't be able to see my tennis matches , " she added . " After I make the team . Again . " That again made them pause to smile at each other . After brief and unspoken mutual congratulations and admirations , they got back to their quarrel . Margalo said , " I can do more than one thing at a time , you know . " " And baby-sitting jobs too ? That 's three things . " " I can count , " Margalo said . " I guess you 're pretty confident , " Mikey grumbled . " You 're the one who keeps telling me to think like a winner . " " I never said you , " Mikey objected . " I meant me . " Margalo gathered up her lunch wrappers and put them into the brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tray . But neither one of them made a move to get up . They were in no hurry to get to an all-school assembly . " So if you do get this part , do you have to kiss someone ? " " What is this sudden interest in kissing ? " Margalo asked . " What makes you so sure you 'll be picked ? " Mikey asked . " I 'm not . " The only thing Margalo was sure of was that she could hear Jennet Jourdemayne 's voice in her head , speaking the lines in a cool-headed , intelligent , courageous way . She had n't even thought of trying out until Mr. Schramm told her she reminded him of Jennet Jourdemayne . Mr. Schramm had been in a production of The Lady 's Not for Burning out in Oregon , he 'd said ; he 'd played Thomas Mendip ; this was before he became a family man and turned in his actor 's equity card for a teaching certificate . He was glad to see that they were still reading it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a class to get to ? He would n't want to make Margalo late for class , he 'd said , and asked , why did n't she try out for Jennet ? " What if you do n't get it ? " Mikey asked . " What if Ms. Larch picks someone else ? Like , Rhonda , " she suggested , naming one of their long-time favorite people to dislike . Margalo had the answer . " Then I 'll have more time to sell cookies , which means I 'll have more money in the bank . " " Although you 'll still have to do something for the play . All eighth graders do . I 'm going to be an usher . " " Usherette . " " Usheress . " " In a little short , swishy skirt , " Margalo said , grinning . " I 'll swish you , " Mikey said . " You 'll need to style your hair , like , curl it for an updo . I 'll help , " Margalo offered . Mikey 's hand went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to long enough , almost halfway down her back . " No way . " " You 'll be adorable , " Margalo promised  --  and they both started laughing . Mikey and adorable were vocabulary words from two different languages . Two different languages spoken on two different planets . " You should usher too , " Mikey suggested . " Ush , " Margalo corrected . " When you do n't get the part . It 's a minimum-stress assignment , and minimum time commitment . Unless  --  would they give you one of the other parts ? Is there another part for someone tall and skinny ? " " Jennet is the only part I want . " " You could play a man , " Mikey suggested . This was not meant to be flattering . " It 's too bad you did n't have the nerve to try out , " Margalo said . " I thought about maybe that little priest , the one with his lute , the spacey one . " Margalo believed that the best revenge was a quick one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be so short and round , you thought you 'd look right . " " Also besides , I do n't have time to learn lines . I 'd have to miss a lot of practices and also I do n't want to let the team down by not playing in a basketball game because of some rehearsal . Also , tennis begins in March , and I 'm not about to miss that . So it 's not that I did n't have the nerve , " Mikey said , with her I-guess-I-win smile . Margalo 's attention had moved on to the new problem : If she did n't get the part , she was going to have to do something else for the play . Every student in each grade  --  and every teacher , too  --  had to do something for the West Junior High School annual class projects , the dance given by the seventh grade for eighth graders , and the play given by eighth graders for everyone . She was about to ask Mikey about the ushering committee , when Tanisha Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many to choose among near Mikey and Margalo  --  and sat down in it . Tan was the only girl as serious about sports as Mikey . In grade school , when they first met her , she was serious about volleyball , but since last year she 'd been serious about basketball instead . Tan had a good chance at an athletic scholarship for college , since she was a really good athlete , and smart enough , and African American . She looked at Margalo with dark , measuring eyes and said , " I 've got bad news . Do you want to hear it ? " " How bad ? " Margalo wondered . " Not bad like your dog died . This is like  --  a dead-goldfish level of badness , " Tan said . She had always run closer to their wavelength than other people . " It 's like a you'll-hate-dinner  --  it 's on a liver-for-dinner level . " " I do n't mind liver , " Mikey objected . " OK , " Margalo decided . " Tell . " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that today in assembly they 're announcing who got parts in the play ? " Tan asked . Margalo nodded . " Sauted , with onions and red wine , " Mikey said . " I know who 's going to be Jennet Jourdemayne . Sorry , but it 's not you . " " Hah ! " Mikey crowed . All victories welcome , that was her motto . " Hunnh , " said Margalo . She was cool , nothing surprised her , nothing got her excited , nothing could upset her or disappoint her . " I told you so , " Mikey said . " Mikey , " Tan protested . " Well I did , " Mikey maintained . Tan grinned . " You 're so bad , you 're perfect . " Mikey smiled right back at her , a So-what ? smile . " How 'd you find out ? " Margalo wanted to know . " The way they 're announcing it , they 're calling the people up onto the stage . I guess they think that 'll make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aimi told me . She 's going to be Jennet . Ms. Larch told her yesterday so she 'd be ready to be called up on stage , and Aimi was too excited not to tell someone . " Tan continued , " I thought you were just as good as Aimi in tryouts . You 're a good liar , so it makes sense that you 'd be a good actress . " " Aimi must have been better , " Mikey pointed out . " Otherwise , why would she get the part ? " " She 's black . " Tan made a point of not adding dummy , made such a big point that she might as well have said it out loud , which was exactly her point . " Except for that , Aimi and Margalo are built a lot alike , tall and slim , and they 're both pretty enough . The only real difference I can see is Aimi 's not white . So , I figure , Ms. Larch wanted someone who looked different from everybody else for Jennet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believe she might be a witch because she looked different  --  when they were looking for someone to blame , for a scapegoat when things went wrong . " " That 's smart casting , " Margalo agreed . " Did she tell Aimi all that ? " Mikey asked . Tan just looked at her , eye sarcasm . " Yeah , but then how do you know ? " Mikey insisted . Then she said , " Wait . OK . I do get it . " In case they did n't believe her , she explained . " The play 's set in the Middle Ages , and the Middle Ages are a lot like junior high . The Middle Ages are the junior high of history . In both places , if you look different , or act different , people are nervous , scared of you . Get people scared of you and they 'll start doing things to make themselves feel un-scared , like  --  burning you at the stake . It 's as simple as math : Different is scary , new is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn . " Each time she said burn , Mikey pointed at Margalo or Tan , as if she was sentencing somebody to be tied to a stake and roasted alive . " I 'll tell you what scares me , " she said , as if either Margalo or Tanisha had asked . " People . " " The Salem witch trials were n't during the Middle Ages , " Margalo pointed out . Mikey ignored her . " By ' they ' I mean mostly men , " she said . " Because women could n't do much of anything back then . Well , they could , and some of them did . Joan of Arc , for example , and look what happened to her because she acted different from other people , and looked different , especially dressed different . Things have n't really changed at all since then , have they ? " Margalo considered deflating this R &R,; which was what her mother called it when Mikey got going on some topic , because it was the opposite of Rest and Recreation . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rave . Margalo was about to advise Mikey to put a lid on it , when Frannie Arenberg , who 'd stopped on her way out of the cafeteria to listen , did it for her . " I think the human race has made some good progress since the Middle Ages , " Frannie said . " Yeah , but you also think Louis Caselli is n't so bad , " Mikey pointed out . " That 's because Louis has a giant crush on her , " Tan said . Frannie never minded being teased , not about her plain , Quaker style of dressing , not about her reputation as the nicest person in school , not even about Louis Caselli 's crush . She said , " I feel sorry for Louis . " " Louis has the brains of a mushroom , " Mikey agreed . " We have to forgive him . At least , " she added , " the rest of you have to . I do n't think I will . " " Besides , as we all know , Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence before she uttered the name in a breathless , sighing voice , " Gregory Peck . " Frannie 's crush on Gregory Peck had begun when they 'd been shown the movie of To Kill a Mockingbird last year . She did n't care if he was old enough to be her grandfather  --  or great-grandfather by now ; and Margalo did agree that he was incredibly handsome . But there was old , and there was way old , and Gregory Peck was definitely in the second category . As soon as Margalo mentioned the one , Mikey leaned toward Tanisha to murmur the name of the other : " Tiger Woods . " In eighth grade you wanted to be half of a couple , so if they did n't have a personal boyfriend , girls could get crushes on celebrities . The important thing was to have a name linked to yours . Almost all eighth graders were linked to someone . Not Mikey , and not Margalo , and there were a few others , too , although not many . Casey Wolsowski was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hero of some book , which most people did n't . This far into the year everybody knew about Frannie 's crush and Tanisha 's ideal man , so they got teased a lot . Frannie and Tan looked at each other . " Their time will come , " Tanisha promised . " In your dreams , " Mikey answered , and Margalo let Mikey speak for her in this , as if she and Mikey were in exactly the same position , untouched , and untouchable . " Anyway , I 'm not about to waste time and erasers on a notebook , " Mikey declared . Eighth-grade girls erased their boyfriends ' initials onto the fronts of their spiral notebooks . It was practically an eighth-grade art form , initialing anything you could get an eraser on . " Have n't you seen Ronnie 's notebooks , with Doug 's name all over them ? And Rhonda  --  it 's pitiful . She 's pitiful . She always was , but this year she 's reached new levels of pitifulness . Or Heather McGinty , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , whoever everybody 's talking about . Acting like she 's some movie-star irresistible sex goddess , hinting about how hot she is . " Mikey concluded this R &R,; " The whole thing 's  --  it 's really embarrassing , and Heather 's not even embarrassed . " Then she grinned . " I 'm enjoying eighth grade . " Then she glared at Frannie . " What 's so funny ? " Frannie stood up , shaking her head . " I have to get an aisle seat for the assembly , " she apologized , " because I got a part . " " Which one ? " Margalo asked , making a silent guess , The mother . " The mother , " Frannie said . " Typecasting , " Mikey announced . " No it is n't , " Margalo said . " The mother is n't  --  " Mikey held up both hands , palms out like a policeman facing traffic , Stop . " Leave me something to be surprised at , why do n't you ? Who else got parts ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised . Anyway , we 're not supposed to tell , " she added , leaving . " Are you trying to get rid of the few friends you have ? " Tan asked Mikey . " What did I do to you ? I just said his name , just Tiger . Ti-ger , Ti-ger . " Mikey ducked out of Tanisha 's reach . " I did n't say anything about , That 's a weird name , or , How dumb is it to think you 're in love with some sports hero who never even heard of you and never will . " " No different from a movie star or a rock star , " Tanisha maintained . But Margalo disagreed . " Tiger Woods is a whole different story from Tyrese . " Then she was diverted . " Denzel Washington . I could go for Denzel Washington . " " Or Will Smith , " Tanisha agreed . Mikey groaned . They ignored her . Margalo did n't remember when it had become fun to make lists of handsome guys , fun just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she did n't deny that she enjoyed it . It was more interesting than listing all the boys in your class , ranked in order of who you 'd like to kiss , or go on a date with , or marry , which one you 'd most want to be marooned on a desert island with , or  --  this was the currently popular list  --  dance with , or slow dance with or super slow dance with , which were all the same unspoken question : Who do you want to go to the dance with ? If every boy was going to ask you , who would you choose ? As some art-room kids passed by , Cassie Davis  --  front-runner for the title of eighth grader with the worst attitude  --  stopped to ask Mikey , " You coming to assembly ? Or what ? " " Is there an or what choice ? " Mikey asked , then " I 'm not joking , " she protested . " I know , " Cassie said . " That 's what makes you so funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " I 'll save you a seat , " Cassie said , passing on by . " Why does she think because we 're in the same homeroom , she should save me a seat ? " Mikey demanded . " She does n't mean it , " Margalo explained . " She wo n't do it . " " Then why does she say she 's going to ? People , " Mikey said , disgusted . Being disgusted with people reminded her of something else . " What committee are you going to be on for the play ? " she asked Tan . Tan was rising , and it really was time to start over to the auditorium . She said , " Promotion  --  you know , getting advertisers for the programs , finding stores that 'll let us put up posters . The committee only meets during lunches , and we can sign up the advertisers and ask at stores during the weekends . It 's Mrs. Sanabria 's committee so you know it 's not going to interfere with the basketball schedule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others from the team . Watching the cafeteria get empty , Mikey looked at Margalo and smiled , a grim **28;657;TOOLONG smile . " The sooner it starts , the sooner it 'll be over . " Like someone about to step into the dentist 's office , Margalo tucked her straight , chin-length hair behind her ears and squared her shoulders . " If you say so . " She rose from her seat . Slowly , reluctantly , they got going , drifting out of the cafeteria , drifting down the hallways , drifting into the auditorium , just two jellyfish riding along on tidal waters .
