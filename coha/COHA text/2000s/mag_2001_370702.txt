For a guy who is helping to revolutionize the face of television advertising , Brown Williams is n't much of a channel surfer . Maybe it 's because he spent 23 years tinkering with TVs as a leading scientist at RCA Labs . But Williams , 60 , has watched enough TV to see its future . More channels are competing for viewers ' short attention spans , and the 30-second spot is losing its grip  --  so advertisers need a new way to get their messages across . <P> That 's why Princeton Video Image , the company Williams co-founded a decade ago , is suddenly exploding on the Madison Avenue scene . After plowing through $50 million , PVI has fine-tuned a patented computer system that digitally inserts virtual billboards and ads into sporting events and other broadcasts . " We make advertisers immune to what people do during the breaks , " says Williams , a native Californian with a Ph.D . in physics . <P> On ESPN 's Sunday Night Baseball broadcasts , viewers see a rotating array of corporate pitches on the backstop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands . In Mexico logos for Pepsi and Tecate magically appear on the field during soccer games . Virtual ads , though , are just the beginning of a world in which advertising will be far more pervasive . If Williams gets his way , PVI will soon be digitally inserting products , not just brand names , into syndicated and prime-time programming . PVI is already negotiating with TNT ( owned by TIME 's parent , AOL Time Warner ) and Studios USA to do virtual product placements on reruns of Law and Order this fall . A Coke machine could appear in the precinct background , or a Saltines box could sit on the D.A . ' s desk . <P> Williams believes that PVI 's high-tech hocus-pocus , already the target of some media watchdogs , could easily triple the ad dollars each program generates . With iPoint , the system Williams has been developing , digital set-top boxes could tailor virtual ads to individual viewers , based on their demographics and buying habits . Pizza Hut could go after Domino 's customers , enticing them to click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can literally target individual TV sets , " says Williams . He just has to hope that most people , unlike him , are still busy watching them . <P>  --  By Daniel Eisenberg
