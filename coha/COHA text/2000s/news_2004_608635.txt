<p> Google Inc. ' s founders relish describing the firm they 've built as unconventional and anti-establishment . But the search engine juggernaut 's carefully crafted roster of early-stage investors reads like a Who 's Who of Silicon Valley , placing the company squarely in the mainstream of technology start-ups . <p> Initial investors in the company included Jeffrey P. Bezos , chief executive of Amazon.com Inc. ; Andy Bechtolsheim , co-founder of Sun Microsystems Inc. ; and Wilson Sonsini , the prestigious Silicon Valley law firm that is advising Google on its upcoming initial public offering , according to company filings . <p> In addition , Google has strong financial ties to Stanford University , which has hatched many start-ups , and where the co-founders met before dropping out of a PhD program to launch the firm . The university 's president , John Hennessy , sits on Google 's board of directors and is a shareholder , as are David Cheriton , a Stanford computer science professor , and the university 's Office of Technology Licensing , which has taken ownership stakes in more than 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financing done by the company , as Google attracted big-name venture capitalist John Doerr of the investment firm Kleiner Perkins , and Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital . The two serve as Google board members , and each of the firms they represent invested about $12.5 million for 9.4 percent of the company . Analysts estimate those stakes could be worth more than $1 billion after the IPO . <p> " It is a traditional Silicon Valley old boys network , " said Alan Meckler , chief executive of Jupitermedia Corp . " It is very similar to what happened in the 1990s when there were a group of 20 or 30 venture capital firms and key people . There is a lot of history repeating itself here . " <p> Tom Taulli , a principal of Bridgewater Capital Corp . who has written a book on initial public offerings , said that by having Wilson Sonsini as the company 's lead outside counsel , Kleiner Perkins as a major investor and Stanford as its progenitor , Google is following a time-tested path . <p> " Wilson Sonsini is blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPOs , " Taulli said . " They are it . Call it whatever you want , but the facts are the facts . This is a very traditional Silicon Valley company . It does n't look very unconventional to me . This is a model of how it is done . " <p> Meckler said Bezos has been an early investor in a number of start-ups . The Amazon chief is often sought after because he can ensure access to high-quality software development , the right venture capital funding , and a cadre of insiders who know how to guide a start-up through early-stage growth and the difficult transition from private to public ownership . <p> Both venture capital firms encouraged Google 's young co-founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , to recruit a seasoned chief executive who would have credibility with investors and others . Google then retained Heidrick &; Struggles , one of the nation 's most highly regarded executive search firms , and in 2001 the firm recruited Eric Schmidt , the former chief technologist of Sun , who was then running Novell Inc. , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay day for its head-hunting services , both Heidrick &; Struggles and the firm 's Silicon Valley-based lead recruiter , John Thompson , became Google stockholders . Analysts estimate the value of their holdings could be tens of millions of dollars . <p> Google also cut deals on the corporate side that led to early investments by Yahoo Inc. , which is now its chief competitor , and by Dulles-based America Online Inc . Google provided search services for users of both Yahoo and AOL , putting its brand name in front of millions of computer users . <p> In fairness to Page and Brin , when they describe Google as iconoclastic , they are referring to the way it has transformed searching the Internet and the firm 's culture , rather than its financial backers . Google officials declined to comment . <p> Googlers , which is what the company calls its employees , work in a headquarters site the company refers to as the Googleplex and have on-site massage , medical care and more . With a high concentration of PhDs , Googlers spend one day a week on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flops and successful innovations , including Google news alerts delivered via e-mail . <p> The company is also taking an unorthodox approach by conducting an electronic auction for its estimated $2.7 billion public offering , and inviting individuals to participate , rather than allowing Wall Street investment firms to decide how to allocate and price shares . Given Google 's strong brand name and heavy use by millions of Web searchers around the world , the auction strategy is designed to create a more stable base of long-term investors by setting a high price for shares before they begin trading , often a deterrent to speculators looking to buy and sell for a quick profit . <p> Google 's immense profitability has given it far more clout with early investors and partners than is typical for new , successful firms . The company relies on advertising for 95 percent of its revenue and is growing rapidly , posting sales of nearly $1 billion last year , and profit of more than $100 million . In the first quarter of this year , the company had $389.6 million in sales and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount in the same quarter a year ago . <p> Google 's early financial success has meant that it has not had to seek multiple rounds of funding  --  and therefore has not had to yield as much control as other start-ups . Brin and Page each own more than 15 percent of the company . The founders intend to maintain control , even after the public offering , by having two classes of stock with unequal voting rights . <p> As Google has grown , it has parted ways with some early investors . For instance , Google and Yahoo were once partners , with Google powering the searches on Yahoo 's Web site . Through that relationship , Yahoo acquired Google stock that its chief financial officer recently estimated could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the IPO . Now the companies are fierce competitors , and Yahoo stands to gain from the past relationship . <p> Likewise , America Online cut a multiyear deal with Google in May 2002 that kept the search engine on the nation 's biggest Internet service , and gave AOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Analysts estimate the holding , which is now 7.4 million shares after stock splits , could be worth several hundred million dollars after the public offering . <p> " It is very much an insiders ' company , " said John Tinker , a managing director with ThinkEquity Partners LLC . " Yahoo came out of Stanford with some venture capital backing . This is the production line that Silicon Valley has put together . This is how they have created companies . Even though Google has revolutionized how we look at the Internet , it has been birthed in a very traditional manner . " <p> Tinker doubts that the proposed auction method , and outreach to individual investors , will succeed and take the IPO process in a different direction . Notwithstanding the auction , Google does retain the right , according to public filings , to set the offering price , and make allocation decisions , in consultation with its investment advisers . <p> " In the end , I wonder if they may not be traditional in how they bring this company public , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shove , if they wo n't be looking at big investors getting a large piece of the pie .
