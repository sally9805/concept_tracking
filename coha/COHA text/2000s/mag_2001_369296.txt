PERSON OF THE YEAR <P> " George W. Bush is the person of the moment , but he did not have the influence over events in the year 2000 to merit your choice . " JIM BOYD Emporia , Kans . <P> I commend TIME for its choice of George W. Bush PERSON OF THE YEAR , Dec. 25-Jan. 1 . The media tended to be biased toward Bush during the whole campaign and its aftermath , but through it all , Bush showed how much grace , class and strength he possesses . I agree that he deserves such an honor . AMY VEACH White Lake , Mich . <P> In 2000 Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia ; the Serbian people overthrew Slobodan Milosevic ; South Korean President Kim Dae Jung put his country and North Korea on their best footing in 50 years ; Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat failed to reach an Israeli-Palestinian agreement ; and Vicente Fox ended 70 years of P.R.I . rule in Mexico through the ballot . To people outside the U.S. , the presidential election was hardly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for better or worse , in 2000 . JOAO LUIS HAMBURGER Sao Paulo <P> I really appreciated your Person of the Year . You made an excellent choice . I am happy for President-elect Bush . CECILIA JENKINS Chicago <P> TIME 's argument for naming Bush is that this was a historic election , one that will be cited in the century to come , and that whoever was the survivor would be a " symbol of a historic showdown . " True , but Bush was not the sole cause of the great drama , simply its beneficiary . He was a part of the action , but so were Vice President Al Gore , Ralph Nader , the designers of the Florida ballot and the Founding Fathers , who created the Electoral College . Bush has not done one thing to effect change on anyone so far . I congratulate him on winning the election , but wait until he does something before singing his praises . You lowered your standards this year . KEVIN GANNON New York City <P> TIME chose a man who has not yet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is important because he was selected to be President by a partisan court , not by the people . DANIEL R. KUEHN Arden Hills , Minn . <P> Bush is the President-elect . Let the naysayers take a break from second-guessing and give the new Administration an opportunity to present its agenda . Both Democrats and Republicans could end up being pleased with the accomplishments of a Bush Administration . WALTER W. SCHOENHOLZ Barrington , Ill . <P> A much better selection would have been Gore and Bush as People of the Year . Both men made their mark on our country 's history in 2000 , but you chose the man who ascended to the presidency by keeping votes from being counted . Extremely disappointing . GINA MAXWELL ULBERT San Antonio , Texas <P> THE CONSTITUTION SURVIVES <P> Thank you so much for the encouraging words " Yes , We 'll Survive " on your cover with the U.S. Constitution Dec. 18 . That simple message of hope and optimism , once commonplace in American culture , helped me walk a little more upright . Enough Chicken Littles can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you for using your voice to build us all up a bit . You were heard . MARK ARNOLD St. Louis , Mo .
