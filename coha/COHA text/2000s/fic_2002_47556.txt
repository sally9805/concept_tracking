HALFBABY 'S ALWAYS BEEN HALFBABY like she came with the name . Maybe the island midwife gave her the name , she does n't recollect clearly , fully , but she 's Halfbaby just like Rockmother is Rockmother . But Rockmother did n't come with her name . The midwife named her Rockmother when Halfbaby was born . Halfbaby thinks it 's because she stands up to things like the rocks do on the shore on the weather side of the island . Rockmother 's birth name was Ruth . The island people call her Rockmother , though , the name as tight to her as a barnacle . It 's a funny name because Rockmother is all lap . She has a lap even when she walks . She has a lap until she sits down ; then her flesh settles , and her flowered dresses tent down to her ankles , ankles thick and white as birch trees . <p> Halfbaby was born here in the house . Some island people go to the mainland to be birthed , but Halfbaby 's never been there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where babies float while they wait to be born . More women go over on the ferry now that the midwife 's dead , but not Halfbaby ; she stays put . <p> She lives with Rockmother at the three corners near the back cove , next to the marsh farm where the three sisters live : Poppy , Rose , and Lily . They did n't come with their names ; their mother gave them to them a long time ago , before the midwife , before Halfbaby . The sisters ' mother loved flowers , and the flowers tumble all around the farmhouse in unruly beds now that the sisters forget to weed . <p> Halfbaby loves the three sisters . They are as old as the umbrella tree on the sandy hook , all in their eighties at least , and they forget things , daily things like weather and eating and where they are and who 's dead and alive , but they never forget that they are ladies . They all dress before leaving the house , always hats and gloves , and black button-up coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the attic to cure the leather , to make it last . Halfbaby bets those shoes are in their eighties , too . One of the sisters , Halfbaby 's not sure which , married a Cole boy at the east end of the island , but she got homesick-even though it 's only five miles one tip of the island to the other-and moved back to the farm . <p> Before she moved back , she dropped a son on the Cole boy , and the boy moved in for a while , not too long ago , in Halfbaby 's time . Halfbaby is n't sure how old she is ; she thinks she might be twenty , might be thirty , in there somewhere ; all the years feel the same , time moving like light and shadow , like tide , like snow , here , then gone . But the Cole boy moved in with the sisters in Halfbaby 's time , and he built gates on the doors with latches on the outside to keep the three sisters from wandering , to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . He was trying to protect the sisters , keep them from wandering to places that were n't there any longer . Keep them from that baffled look they got when they arrived at some place that was n't there with that straggle-haired bewilderment : Where is the store ? The farm ? Where is the place that I am standing in ? Where is the world ? What was I about to do , here in this place that is n't here ? <p> He tried to keep them from that . He tried to keep them in place , in time , and out of his tools . He was an electrician . <p> But you might as well try to keep lightning out of the sky . The sisters kept getting out , getting tangled in the coils of wire , banging into the spools . And he gave up . He was a good boy for coming home , but he just gave up . He moved to the mainland , and disappeared as far as Halfbaby knew , disappeared among all the impatient unborn across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Rockmother does n't have much use for men anyhow . She says she 's more comfortable around the women . When Halfbaby asks about her father , Rockmother just snorts . She says her father was a rooster , and that makes Halfbaby laugh , because then Halfbaby would be half rock , half rooster . She can feel the rock in her when she crosses the salt marsh and stands on the shore , feeling the outcrop beneath her feet as she watches the wind whip the whitecaps up like egg whites . But she feels no rooster in her ; she 's got nothing to crow about . Rockmother tells her that . <p> The sisters used to keep roosters , hens too , there in the yard . There 'd be piles of eggs in the juniper bush , at the base of the elm , surprising places , and the ones the raccoons did n't get would cook in the sun , smell awful if they cracked . But the chickens roamed off , and the sisters did n't miss the eggs . No chickens now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks she can still make them out , scratching in the driveway , walking that comical walk like their two ends are headed different ways only to have them bump back in the middle . It makes her laugh as she cracks an egg against the rim of the yellow-ware bowl , the one with the blue stripe , and Rockmother startles , stares needles at her . " What you laughing at ? You gone simple again ? People who laugh at nothing , they got places for them . " <p> Limbo . Mainland . A place for people like that . Halfbaby does n't turn around . She feels the needles in the back of her neck , but they do n't hurt . They stitch time . She thinks she can hear Rockmother 's laps settling comfortably down onto her thighs . unfolding like dough over where her bedrock lap should be . That 's what morning sounds like , quiet enough to hear what you can not see , Rockmother 's fat oozing , the yolk dripping out of the shell , the long-gone chickens scratching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of time in her ; she has a gift . She 's not simple , but she sees beyond sometimes . <p> Rockmother wants corn fritters this morning , fritters with maple syrup , and Halfbaby 's reaching for the whisk when she sees the twin yolks nestling in the bowl . " Double yolk , " she says . " That 's good luck . Rose told me double yolks bring double good . It 's an omen . " <p> Rockmother grumbles . " I do n't know about omens , but we can use the luck . " <p> And Halfbaby cracks the second egg , and that one 's double too . Double double . Never seen a triple , no yolks like the three sisters . She does n't tell Rockmother about the second egg , but she 's happy . She whistles as she scoops flour in her hands , lets it sift through her fingers onto the yolks , cozy in the bowl . She heats the fat on the cookstove and listens to Rockmother creak on the rocker with the stubby legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch her weight , and the legs are short . She can tilt in and out , wait for her body to catch up when she raises or lowers herself . She grunts a little as she rocks . Halfbaby drops some water onto the fat to test if it 's hot enough . The water spits . She scrapes corn off last night 's ears into the bowl , then spoons the batter into the fat and listens to it hiss as it plumps up , watches it rise as it fries . Rockmother loves breakfast . Halfbaby is always careful with breakfast because she knows that it readies Rockmother for the day . She can be sloppy with lunch , serve leftovers or sandwiches , but breakfast matters . When the fritters are just as gold as August corn , Halfbaby dips the slotted spoon , rescues them . " There , " she says , setting the plate , the pretty morning plate , blue Depression glass , on the daisy-sprinkled oilcloth of the table . She waits for Rockmother 's body to shift . " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat as star points around the centered fritters , pooling amber in the syrup . Mornings are good . <p> Halfbaby does n't eat breakfast , just juice and coffee . Morning food makes her sloggy , like bees are droning in her head . She likes her head clear and light so she can see time . She 's as thin as Rockmother is fat , looks more kin to the three sisters , who are spindle-thin like cob dolls , than she does to Rockmother . <p> After she cleans the dishes , she likes to sit in the attic . Used to be mornings she had home school with Rockmother , doing figures and letters . Rockmother liked reading the horsehide Bible , where there 's a book named for her-not the Book of Rockmother , the Book of Ruth , her name before she hardened . Ruthmother . <p> Halfbaby liked the reading better than the figures . She never had a knack with numbers . She thinks some people think numbers , some think words , or maybe scenes . The Cole boy used to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting like he used to do here : I been to the mainland twenty-two times this year . That spool 's got a good four yards yet . Takes twenty minutes to walk to the pier , twenty-four in snow . <p> He knew degrees Fahrenheit , the weight and ages of people he talked about , their shoe sizes , how many lampposts and mailboxes lined the back-cove road . He must have spent his whole life counting . When he talked to Halfbaby , his numbers made her dizzy . They cluttered her up . <p> The attic clutter did n't make her dizzy . She knew everything there even if she did n't count it up . From the high window she could see the bay , and the light from the window raised swirls of sequiny dust . Rockmother 's brace was there . The doctor made her wear it , her back bad , he said , because she was carrying two people in weight . Halfbaby can remember her wearing it like a skeleton on the outside of her body . But Rockmother outgrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halfbaby ca n't believe it ever snapped around her like a slatted coat . Sometimes she crawls into it and lies on her back , imagining her stomach pouching out , her breasts swelling and swelling until she fills the brace like her own rib cage . But Rockmother even then was twice the woman she is . <p> She sits in the attic now , thinking about chickens in the poppies run red riot around the marsh farm , and she laughs again thinking how they walk in two directions at once . Did the tail lead the head or the head the tail ? <p> She can smell the varnish cracking on the high chair , feel the decal of the puddle duck curling from the wood . Someday she 'd be sitting in the attic , and the decal would be gone , finally crackled into paper , into dust . Then it could spangle the window light , settle in the floor crevices . <p> There 's a pile of guano by the chimney , where the bats hang , and a neat little pile of delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they puttied glass back into the window-frame . She does n't disturb the pile . Bones at rest . Pyramids of bones as delicate as ivory straws . <p> Hornets ' nests whisper , papery cones hanging like bells on the framing ribs . A few water-stains near the chimney . Some mortar unchinked and gravelly on the floor . <p> There 's an old immigrant 's trunk , its top mounded to shed water , and stuffed with Rockmother 's important papers , old silvery photographs , some papers inked with letters that look like they were written with spiderwebs . Brown ink on papers as yellow as cream or old tea gloves . Another trunk of linens Rockmother says she does n't need but wo n't throw away . Nobody throws away anything on an island . Somebody took too many pains getting them there in the first place . So the linens wait , staining themselves with patience . Time itself could leave watermarks , Halfbaby knew . <p> A neat row of shoes , leather curing in the attic heat , wrapped , almost wrapped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Leather is cured now , but Rockmother 's plump feet outgrew the shoes some time ago . Time cures leather and people , Halfbaby knows , hardens them rather than heals them . Cures , cures . The word means twice at once . <p> Time cures the soaps too , drilled and strung on a rope to dry because it makes the soap last longer , Rockmother says . Enough soap that it will be living here long after she and Rockmother are gone ; it gets that hard-like trying to wash with granite . <p> She rocks the cradle of the back brace with her hand . When it is time for lunch , the window light will cross the first wooden rib of the linen trunk and Halfbaby will bump down the ladder-steep steps . And then it 's time . <p> Lunch is cheese sandwiches , but first she has to trim the rind like the heel calluses on Rockmother 's feet . Beneath the crust , the flesh of the cheddar is still fresh . Rockmother 's feet harden under her weight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facedown on the quilt while Halfbaby pares with her sharpest knife . Sometimes Rockmother complains , but Halfbaby knows she feels it about as much as a mussel shell feels the shucking knife , not at all . Rockmother 's flesh is dead and crumbles in her fingers . <p> Halfbaby watches the chopping blade ease through the firm cheddar . But then she 's gone . Watching something else . A boat , prow up , just the bow poking up like a shrine in the Phragmites stalks that are rustling , gossipy , over the tip . Clam flats . She can whiff the secret rich muck of it . <p> " Halfbaby , how you coming with that sandwich ? " Rockmother is trying to call her back to herself . The rocker creaks ; it 's called a grandmother because it crouches close to the floor . When Rockmother sits in it , Halfbaby ca n't see the stencil on the black top slat , but she knows it 's there . Its feathery , faded-gold , twin-daisy eyes like the egg yolks , petals spoking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat until they stop . <p> Halfbaby 's rehearsing the stencil . The slab of cheese stands against the blade . <p> " I said , Halfbaby , how you coming with that lunch ? " <p> And then the slice of cheese is in her hand , and her hand is laying the cheese out nicely on a bed of white bread , and Rockmother is grunting and creaking again . <p> " I found his boat , " she says . <p> " How about you find yourself some butter and grill me up that sandwich , " Rockmother says . <p> Rockmother 's voice is mad , but she is n't . Not really . More like the warning growl from a fear-biting dog ; they do n't mean it . Rockmother 's voice knows that Halfbaby is having one of her spells . That 's what Rockmother calls them . But they are n't spells . More like side trips . Like time took a side trip and landed at Halfbaby 's door , asking for directions . Problem is that Halfbaby never knows where they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> Rockmother tolerates the spells , because people come to Halfbaby for her second sight . That 's what they call it , second sight , though Halfbaby is n't sure if she is seeing first or second , forward or backward . She just sees . And people pay her for seeing . <p> After lunch , people come to the parlor and want Halfbaby to see . Sometimes she sees ; sometimes she does n't . But Rockmother makes them pay her whichever way . Butter money . <p> There 's an expression makes Halfbaby laugh-when the minister 's wife said , " Why , I have half a mind to tell her what I think . " Halfbaby knew that was n't what she meant . She laughed because she knew all about half a mind . She lives in the half-mind , half here , half somewhere else , another place or time . Above-stairs , below-stairs . Attic and parlor . Here and there . But she does n't know if , like the yolks , they split or join . But she thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something extra or she is something missing . Phantom pain , the way she thinks an amputated leg must feel , or the amputee . But it is n't pain . It ca n't be pain because it makes her laugh . She is laughing now as she butters the bread , laughing at the minister 's wife who does n't know she is being funny when she speaks with half her mind . <p> Rockmother says , " There 's places for people who laugh at nothing . " And her voice still burrs like a fear-biter 's . But she does n't mean it . She likes the butter money . And Halfbaby slaps the bread onto the hot skillet , and it sizzles , and Rockmother rocks , and the afternoon pours honey thick into the room . <p> Later , Cap Dobbins will knock on the door , and Halfbaby will help him find his boat . <p> Halfbaby sits on the cracked leather of the mahogany chair in the parlor , waiting for Cap . Rockmother is letting herself smother the red settee , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself very still like a cup of tea on a tray . She is waiting to see . <p> " You having a spell ? " Rockmother asks . <p> But it never happens like that . She does n't have spells ; more like the spells have her . It 's like opening a door in your own house and finding a corridor you did n't know was there . Like you scale the ladder steps and open the attic door , only it 's the cellar , and not your cellar but somebody 's , because you can smell the use-the sweet rot of forgotten onions , coal dust , rust on the lids of the canning jars . Somebody 's been here . Somebody besides you . Somebody is beside you , although you are there , too . Like a hand slipped into someone else 's glove , a second skin seamed taut over your own . <p> Halfbaby has a trick to ready herself . She tries to remember backward . Sometimes it helps when her mother rocks , the grunt and creak and rock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parlor , so Halfbaby has to play her trick on herself . She tries to remember backward , all the way back to the midwife giving Rockmother her name when her name still was Ruth . But she ca n't get that far . She can only get as far back as when the words stop . Or before they begin . She is staring at the ceiling , only she does n't know the word . She is just staring . Light plays over the ceiling , and neither light nor ceiling has a name . They are just what they are . But the light tumbles , and Halfbaby hears herself laugh . Then a face blocks the light . The face is very close . Her hands are before the face . The face is Rockmother 's only not hard yet , Ruth 's . The light seems to be sparking from her hair , which is yellow , not white . And the lips , the mouth , mean something . But she does n't have the language for what they mean . Then the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? " <p> But she is n't . You ca n't force it . It 'd be like opening the attic door at night . She never goes into the attic at night . No light . She waits for the light , or the lightness . Her stomach feels hollow . She never eats until after the parlor . Supper she eats . But not breakfast , not lunch . But she likes to cook for Rockmother . She is laughing now at the cheese rind . <p> Rockmother says , " Do n't go simple on me . " <p> But she 's not . She 's not simple . She 's just waiting for time to stop scratching around , to figure out like a chicken which way it 's headed . <p> When Cap knocks on the door , she feels a little thrill trill up her spine . She always feels like this when Rockmother brings people into the parlor , because she tries to see what they see , what she and Rockmother look like from outside . She tries to see their squat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the widow 's walk all rotten and askew , leaning like rummies against each other in the wind . She tries to see herself with her eyes closed , sitting straight-backed in the chair at the table . The globe of the hurricane lamp unlit . Rockmother humping herself onto the settee . But she can not see herself from the outside ; it all feels inside to Halfbaby . <p> She opens her eyes , and Cap is there . He wears a Buffalo plaid jacket , a matching cap bunched in his hand . He has a lazy smile . She smiles back . He likes her . Halfbaby is pretty , she knows , because the Cole boy told her so when he was building the gates to keep the sisters in the house . Rockmother came and got her and told him to build himself a gate , but Rockmother did n't need to worry . The Cole boy was old even then , before he went to the mainland . Halfbaby did n't care about any old man like the Cole boy . But she likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no hurry-up about them . <p> Rockmother 's all hurry-up . She says , " Sit down and get on with it . We have n't got all day . " <p> But he moves slow into the matching chair at the table like he knows otherwise , like he knows all day is exactly what they 've got . <p> " I 've seen your boat , " Halfbaby says . " Least I think it 's yours . " <p> " Have you now , " he says and slaps his hat on the table , and it seems <p> like too much gesture for Rockmother , because Halfbaby hears her flap and re-form under her dress like startled jello . <p> " I think so . " <p> " Do n't that beat all ? Where you see it ? " <p> Halfbaby shakes her head , just half a shake . " In the reeds . Clam flats . I can smell some pogies rotting . " <p> " Jeezum , " Cap says . " That 's not much help . Could be anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " Rockmother says . " It 's not on the ocean . " <p> Cap twists away from Halfbaby , and she can feel the cords tighten in his neck . " That 's like saying it 's not on the moon . " <p> She feels his cords tighten on her neck now . Then she 's there and not there . But it 's not the boat . Not mud . She sees . Sees some other darkness . But it 's muck , too . Smells blood . But not clean like blood-salt and metal-sharp and used-up like ammonia , like cellars . She ca n't breathe . Choking on blood and that smell and the one who lies beside her , choking her , choking with her ? <p> Cap says , " Mud . Mud is everywhere . Reeds everywhere too . How do I know that it 's even my boat ? " <p> Halfbaby 's trying hard to breathe , sees red , tastes red , her mouth gaping . She feels like a fish from the inside . Hooked . Hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " See what you 're doing , " Rockmother says . " See what you 're doing to the girl . " <p> " Girl , shit . She 's older than I am . " <p> The room bulges . Halfbaby feels like a jellied eye centering the room , which curves away from her everywhere . Rockmother is grunting , but it is taking her a long time to get up . Then she 's up and pulling Halfbaby 's hands away from her neck , where she 's clawing herself . Rockmother 's trying to unbend her hands , saying " See what you done ? " <p> Cap is still smiling lazily at her when she comes back . He 's shaking his head . " Quite a show you put on . " <p> Halfbaby feels the sucking , squooshy sound the mud makes when it releases your boot , and then she can see the umbrella tree and she knows where she is . " The hook , " she says . Her breath comes hard . " Your boat 's free . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue boat , " she says . " Blue boat . " <p> " I 'll be damned . " Cap is standing . His hat is on his head , one earflap jutting out . He 's unfolding money into Rockmother 's hand . Her hand looks yeasty , unbaked , next to his . His hand is chap-hard , and the nails are rimmed with grease . Dark crescent moons . <p> Halfbaby thinks that , flap down , he looks like a half-basset , but he is gone before she can say so . Gone hunting , half-hunting like half-basset . Then Rockmother is stroking her neck and saying , " I thought you were going to strangle yourself the way you went at your throat . " <p> Halfbaby swallows the half-basset howl . Halfbaby is tired and hungry . Long trail . Too long . " I went too far , " she says . " I went too far back . " <p> And Rockmother is trying to shush her , stroking her hands . Her hands feel wet and sweet on Halfbaby 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm not sure about the boat , " Halfbaby says . " I 'm half-sure , but I 'm not sure . " <p> " It does n't matter , " Rockmother says . " He only gave me three dollars . You get what you pay for . " <p> Then Halfbaby hears Rockmother clattering in the kitchen . Rockmother will fix her supper-maybe beans , she 's very handy with beans  --  and brown bread , always brown bread with beans . A double yolk , lucky dinner . And then one of the sisters will stray by as they sometimes do , and that will be today . <p> Then Halfbaby can dream like she does when she 's awake , only no one will pay her . And she wo n't need to worry about whose dreams they are and where they come from because she 'll be asleep . Maybe she 'll dream the blue boat . Blue boat . Maybe she wo n't . Wherever the blue boat is , that 's where it is . <p> The sisters do not stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans , grilled ham . Rockmother counts the butter money while Halfbaby washes the dishes . In bed Halfbaby waits for sleep . She runs her finger down the seam on her side . She can not see it because she can not see herself from the outside , but she knows it is there because she can feel it with her finger , a seam like a seam in a glove running up and down . She thinks that it must be how the dreams sneak in while she sleeps . The way a tide noses a blue boat out or in . The way a stain weaves mto linen , ink into paper . A seam in time . Yolks in a bowl staring crosseyed at the flour sifting down . <p> It snows . Halfbaby wakes up to snow . That can not be right . There are still flowers snaggling the gardens at the marsh farm , but there they are , heads poking up through the snow . So it snows . <p> Rockmother is already downstairs . She is n't waiting for Halfbaby . Halfbaby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says when she enters . " Means hard winter . I 'm going on the ferry to get a few things . Be gone all day . You stay inside till I get back . " <p> Halfbaby nods . She wants to be cooking the bacon . She does n't want to go outside . Rockmother 's boots flap around her ankles , where she ca n't close the zippers . An egg plops onto the skillet beside the bacon , shrivels . A single yolk . <p> " No luck , " Halfbaby says . <p> But Rockmother hears " No lock . " " No lock , " she says , " but you do n't have to let anyone in . No one will be out in the snow anyway . " <p> But Halfbaby knows that is n't true , because Rockmother is going out . Then she does . <p> Halfbaby watches Rockmother 's tracks in the snow fill up till she can no longer see tracks . Then the sun cracks out . Cracks like an egg . Rainbows sparkle everywhere on the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just the tracks , little mounds of footed snow , mashed , leading away from the house . The world is wet and shiny . <p> Halfbaby watches the world from the attic window . Snow , then puddles . Some of the flowers shake themselves in the marsh-farm gardens , unbending , standing up straight again . Slowly . The air is damp , sunny , and cool . It is fall , but it smells like spring . One of the sisters tilts outside , her black triangle of a coat sharp against the white clapboard of the farm . First she looks like a wet leaf on a stick , then closer , larger , like a scarecrow but with a hat like a crow , trim and black , feathered . Then , close up , she is Lily . Then gone . Halfbaby can not see her , but she hears a knock on the door . When she opens the door , Lily is in the parlor . <p> Lily has a look like Halfbaby knows from the inside , like she 's happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . She has a can in her hands in her coated lap . The sisters always bring gifts when they call , but they forget that they have them . <p> " Now what is this ? " Lily asks . She stares at the can of evaporated milk in her hands . " Did you give me this ? " <p> " No , " Halfbaby says , " you brought it . " <p> " Then , " Lily says , and she sets the can on the table . <p> Halfbaby smiles and says , " Thank you . " <p> Halfbaby does not know how much time elapses before Lily starts visiting . When she does , it 's as if she 's wound like a clock , a story that must tick out . She is talking about Rose and the Cole boy . " So many babies then . That spring . Strange weather , like the weather itself gone shack-wacky , wanted to break out-hail and sun . Omens like Ruth 's baby , born about the same time as Rose 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cut it down to size herself , tried to . Blood everywhere . But it was n't murder . No sin . She was trying to clean it up . " <p> Lily is rocking although she is n't in a rocking chair . Memory swings her pendulum . " Cold , though , to cut your own child . The midwife said she was like a rock . " <p> Rock . Halfbaby is listening and not listening , the way snow is there and melting at the same time . She shivers . She is cold or frightened . <p> " But the mainland doctor , he cleaned it up . Throwed half the baby away . The other half growed up fine . They say so . Who knows anything at all . I saw a two-headed cow once until one of the cows moved . I know a boy raised , whose sister was actually his mother , which made him uncle to himself . Who knows the truth ? " She nods ; her pale blue eyes clot with pearls . <p> Halfbaby is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see through the pearls . She is very still : Rockbaby now . But Halfbaby knows the truth . She wants to ask about names , but she knows you do n't name what you throw away , just what you keep : Halfbaby . But no matter how she cut it , they were two with the same name : Halfbaby . Halfbabies . <p> Lily is staring at the can of evaporated milk , her eyes wide , the pupils round and large like black-eyed Susans ; the black-blues rolling with the pearls . Her breath is coming in shallow pants . Her eyes are spooked like a horse 's , roll white and wary like she 's waiting for that can of condensed milk to do something any second , unlatch the gates and let time come stampeding in or out . She is lost again , and Halfbaby will have to help her get her bearings , map out the walk home to the farm next door . <p> Halfbaby says her name several times : Lily , Lily , Lily . Lily stares at Halfbaby like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they got there . She does n't know what they will do next . <p> But Halfbaby knows : The can will be a can . Halfbaby will be Halfbaby . Halfbaby knows : WHERE is the place that I am standing in . WHERE is always the place . Not a question . <p> When Lily is gone , Halfbaby is happy because she can rock in the rocker and know what she knows . Not the Cole boy way of knowing , the other way-knowing what you already know-if you can just get still enough to listen . Rocking and drifting in a bright-blue boat . Rockmother , savage with pain . Savage with killing and birthing . <p> Which half , mother , do you keep as you make your correction ? Rock . Mother . Which half do you love , Halfbaby ? Which half hate ? Until the doctor crosses from the mainland to fix it , but too late to heal . He saves half . <p> Halfbaby divides time . Not like numbers . Time divides . Time divides itself . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another word that means twice at once . <p> She does n't feel that something is missing , more that she is what is missed , that out there her sister-self looks for her . Halfbaby understands now that what she sees is what her sister-self sees for her while she is looking , looking for her-restless in some place she can not imagine , mainland , some vast place , foggy with souls impatient for bodies . Mainland . There . <p> Here is island and rock and Halfbaby waiting to be found by her self-sister who is n't dead because she was only half always and half rocks here . A thought waiting to occur . A blue boat in the reeds . A boot mucked deep in the mud . <p> What does it mean to have half your sight adrift ? But Halfbaby somehow has bone-knowledge , blood-sureness that we all have shadowselves , slipping moorings . She just is n't sure , is n't absolutely sure which half is she . The half who 's gone or half who 's here . Everywhere we grope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill corners with chewed wedding dresses . Chimney sparrows nest in eaves of time , nests woven from other nests , something old , something new . And Halfbaby knows , too , why her world is manless . She was born married . Like Rockmother read in her book of Ruth : Intreat me not to leave thee , or to return from following after thee : for whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge .... Where thou diest , will I die , and there will I be buried . <p> Ruth a twice-word , too-a name and a name for sorrow and mourning and pity . Ruth . Ruthless . Rockmother . <p> And Halfbaby knows that she is already dead and already alive . Buried aboveground with one eye cocked here , one there , time collapsing like a telescope between them . Halfbaby knows what she has always half-known , that half of her is out there waiting in a blue boat on the sea , the limbo sea of the unborn , for Halfbaby to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knows where she is now , time running a seam between her and her . And when Rockmother comes home with her packages and parcels , tinned goods and flour bags and dried fruit , she will find Halfbaby rocking backward before Rockmother became rock , before the midwife named her ; before the doctor slit Wholebaby 's world ; before blood ; before time , rocking-Halfbaby but holy , her cockeyed eyes ; and Halfbaby wholly there . A twin reflection sliding wavery over the water , dappling time . To find . To be found . <p> Blue boat . Blue boat . <p> Author Affiliation
