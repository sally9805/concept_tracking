Chapter One A Military Affair by Merline Lovelace " Raven One , this is Raven Three . " The call came through Tess 's earpiece , soft and staticy in the stillness of the hot , steamy afternoon . Reaching for the radio clipped to the shoulder of her green Nomex flight suit , she keyed her mike . " This is Raven One . Go ahead Raven Three . " " Unidentified nape at nine o'clock . " Nape . Her team 's slang for naked ape , or human . She spun around , her boot heels crunching on the crushed shells that constituted the only runway on this tiny atoll in the South Pacific . Blinking salty perspiration from her eyes , she searched the jungle edging the airfield . " I make him at fifty meters , " her team member radioed . Seconds later , Tess spotted the figure moving through the dappled shadows . He was on the dirt track that led from town , if you could call the dozen or so thatched huts perched on stilts a town . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she brought her weapon to her shoulder . The high-powered scope fixed on the distant image and magnified it seventy times over . She did n't particularly like what she saw . The nape was tall . Lean . Scruffy as hell . His cheeks and chin sported several days of dark , bristly growth . His tropical-flowered shirt flapped open above wrinkled tan shorts . He wore decent-looking boots , but appeared to be missing one sock . What knotted Tess 's stomach muscles , though , was the camera looped around his neck . The camera appeared ordinary enough . One of those digital jobbies that stored hundreds of images on one chip and downloaded directly to a computer . The kind every tourist seemed to have invested in these days . But the man who carried this one did n't look like your average tourist , which made Tess wonder just why the heck he was heading to the tiny airstrip and what he wanted pictures of . The area threat briefing she and her team had received before departing Hawaii had stressed that relations between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved considerably since its bloody , ten-year-long civil war had ended in 1998 . But here , at the northern tip of the island chain , anti-American sentiment still ran high . Understandable , Tess supposed , given the U.S.-backed covert operation involving South African mercenaries that had failed so miserably and cost so many lives . The handful of residents on this tiny atoll had been less than welcoming when a plane bearing United States Air Force markings had swooped down yesterday . Tess flicked a quick look over her shoulder at the C-130 Hercules she and her team were charged with protecting . The four-engine transport was parked at the far end of the runway , poised for a fast takeoff . Its crew waited in the shade of the wing . Edgy and anxious , they were sweating out the return of the recovery team that had climbed up the island 's jagged volcanic peak to the crash site of the World War II-era Corsair . The team should be starting back down the mountain any time now . They 'd hacked their way up to the mangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio report indicated little had survived the crash and subsequent detonation of the plane 's ordnance , not to mention six decades of scavenging by wild creatures . All they 'd recovered from the site were a few bits of human bone . Still , those fragments represented a fallen warrior who 'd served his country during a time of great crisis . It was Tess 's job to make sure no one - including the small cadre of al-Qaeda-trained terrorists believed to be operating out of base camps in neighboring Indonesia - messed with the people or the plane sent to transport this fallen warrior home for long-overdue honors and burial . Her glance cut back to the nape . He looked harmless , but she 'd long ago learned never to trust appearances . Anyone in her line of work who did was asking for a bullet . " I 'm moving up for an intercept , " she told her team . " Raven Two and Four , maintain your positions . Raven Three , back me up . " " Roger , chief . " Danny Boyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got you covered . " Tess lowered her weapon and tucked it into the crook of her arm . The M249 SAW - Squad Automatic Weapon - was outfitted with a Special Ops package , yet was still light enough to be carried easily and fired from the hip , even when loaded with a 200-round ammunition box . After six years as a military cop , Tess could take the SAW apart and clean it in six minutes flat . After three additional years as one of the air force 's elite Phoenix Ravens , she could reassemble it again in her sleep . The butt of the weapon rested lightly on her hip as she crossed the clearing toward the nape . The brutal training program every Phoenix Raven went through was designed to provide a working knowledge of everything from international law to unconventional and highly effective close-combat techniques . In what was touted as the equivalent of graduate program for supercops , instructors took law enforcement and security to the next level . In the field , however , the basic operational principle of every security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force continuum and escalate only as necessary . In this case , Tess decided , she 'd start with a simple command . " That 's far enough ! " she shouted . " Stop where you are . " ( Continues ... )
