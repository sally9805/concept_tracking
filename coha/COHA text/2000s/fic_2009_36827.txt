Sunoya , is n't it time ? " <p> She could n't tell him . Could n't tell him about the dream , could n't tell him what was basically wrong . <p> Sunoya looked into the warm , acorn-colored eyes of her Uncle Kanu . The two of them sat across the center fire of the home they shared with the rest of their family . She knew he loved her . She loved him . But he did n't understand . She 'd been hiding the dream from him , uncertain of its meaning  --  terrified of its meaning . And she 'd been dishonest with him . No doubt about that , and no choice . <p> Now he thought it was time to honor her , to lift her up to replace himself as the village 's Medicine Chief . <p> Impossible . <p> She puffed breath out . She had to say something . " Uncle . . . ? <p> " Sunoya ? " <p> For weeks she 'd been seeing something . It came to her at night , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she woke up early and lay in her elk blankets , looking at the small disc of sky through the smoke hole in the hut . It came to her in the afternoon , when she bent down to the river to fill her gourd with water for the family . She could n't stop seeing it . Dream , vision , it did n't matter what she called it . She 'd seen the Cape of Eagle Feathers bloodied , corrupted , fouled , stinking . It haunted her . <p> She had to do something . Except that she was flawed . Might be flawed . <p> For now all the tribe praised her . They pointed to the webbed fourth and fifth fingers of her left hand , an omen that came among women of her family every few generations and always marked a shaman . She had gone to the Emerald Cavern and been initiated in the tradition of the most powerful tribal shamans . Kanu said she had prodigious gifts , and told everyone that even at such a young age  --  she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entire village was ready to honor her with position and power . <p> " Sunoya , is something wrong ? " <p> Suddenly the hut felt oppressive . The faint light from the smoke hole at the top . The strong smells of burned wood and tobacco , the scents of the herbs hung over the door to keep out disease , odors of a dozen human beings living in close quarters . " Let 's go for a walk . " <p> At least she had gotten some words out . <p> She gave the old man a helping hand up and led him , ducking , through the door flap . <p> She looked around at this village of the Galayi people as they strolled . Though their name meant People of the Caves , they now lived in dome-shaped , wattle and daub huts circled around a village green . On the east side of the circle stood an opening , and the two largest huts in the village faced each other across the space . On the north side mounded the hut of the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted in white , symbolizing peace . On the other side was the hut of the Red Chief , with a door outlined in a red design , symbolizing war . The Medicine Chief , Kanu , and his family lived in an ordinary hut in the circle of ordinary villagers . Medicine power , in the common view , did n't rank with politics or war . <p> Smoke wafted out of the holes in the tops of all of the huts . <p> Inside some women were cooking evening meals , and the fires warmed the huts against the night . Outside other women were grinding corn from the harvest . Still others were making moccasins for their men for the coming fall hunt , which would supply meat for the winter . Men were flaking points for the spears , or lashing points to shafts with buffalo sinew . A few skilled men were making darts for their atlatls , long rods that acted as levers to hurl spears with great speed . <p> Several families lived in each hut , grandparents , two or three daughters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched some boys throwing balls for their dogs in the middle of the green . <p> These were her people , and this was their life , ordinary human lives painted in red and blue , the tribal colors representing success and failure . The men wore palm-sized discs of rawhide inside their shirts indicating the state of their endeavors , red paint for victory on one side , blue on the other side for loss . These emblems were called zadayis . When a war party defeated the enemy , it came back wearing the red sides outward . If it lost , the men wore the blue sides showing . The same held for hunting parties . All the tribe 's life was written in red and blue . <p> Any Medicine Chief 's duty was to help these people lead red lives . Sunoya especially was bound by that calling . She knew that she could justify her existence only by taking care of the people . Otherwise , by the augury of her birth , she should have been killed at first breath . <p> Her people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , berries , acorns , chestnuts , and seeds , meat from the deer , elk , and sometimes buffalo . Clothes cut from tanned deer skins , blankets of elk robes with the hair left on , and every sort of implement that could be made from wood , stone , and the bones , hoofs , horns , and even stomachs of animals . In practical matters the tribe was strong . Their weakness was that they did not realize , not fully , that these blessings were gifts of the Immortals , earned by walking the red path of goodness and not the blue path of ignorance . <p> Did she have the courage to act ? Did she have the right to act ? She was lost , and no one knew it . <p> She had to tell her uncle . She turned to face him . " First I want to go to the Emerald Cavern again . " <p> There , it was said . <p> Kanu waited . It was the way of the Galayi people to be patient , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ask a question . They had met other peoples who talked in a criss-cross way , comments and challenges flying like dogs barked , and they thought this behavior very rude . <p> Sunoya could n't tell Kanu her vision of the Cape . If it was real , it was given as a responsibility to her , not to him . <p> " I know you think I 'm stalling . I know you want me to be elected and given your duties . " <p> She also knew why . Since his wife died , he felt older than his sixty winters . He was afraid he could n't keep up with what the people asked of him . A few wanted spiritual counsel , or healing of illnesses of the spirit . Parents wanted a name for a newborn child . Barren women wanted charms that would give them babies . Would-be lovers wanted songs to mesmerize the girls they pined for . Elderly people , as they approached the time of crossing to the Darkening Lands , wanted interpretations of their dreams . And much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I came here to do what you 're asking . " She fingered the webbed fourth and fifth fingers of her left hand . Her mind drifted back over the seven winters she 'd been here , ever since her mother died . She 'd been sent to this village precisely to learn from Kanu . She thought with plea sure of her own growing mastery , and his delight in her flair for learning . He had no doubt she was a true shaman . <p> She looked into her uncle 's eyes and felt awful for not being able to tell him everything he wanted to hear . So simple to say , ' I accept this responsibility now . It is my path in life . ' But if she was a true shaman , and her birth had not corrupted her spiritual eyes , then what she had seen was true . That meant she was obligated first to do something about her dream . <p> She twisted her mouth . All she could do was repeat lamely , " Right now I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what the devil was bothering his niece . Did she doubt herself ? With her preparation and talent ? Madness . Or was it something else ? <p> Galayi manners did n't let him pry into her mind . When she wanted to tell him , she would . If she wanted to tell him . <p> She said , " Maybe you will get your sons to take me . " <p> " Of course , " Kanu said . He pivoted away and looked at the setting sun . That was that . His family 's effort would be considerable . She 'd have to be escorted , even though all the territory was Galayi . His two sons-in-law ( Galayi men always married into the woman 's family , not the other way ) would have to pack food , moccasins , blankets , and winter coats on the dogs , take their wives , and walk with Sunoya for five days across several mountain ridges to the Soco River , up the river to the Cheowa village , and up Emerald Creek to the Cavern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Sunoya did something he did n't understand . <p> He turned to her and caught a flicker of fear on her face . She controlled it instantly . <p> " Do you want to leave tomorrow morning ? " Kanu asked . You who frighten yourself . You who hold yourself to standards no one else meets . <p> " Yes . " <p> " I 'll speak to my daughters ' husbands now . " He walked away , his step uncertain . <p> As Sunoya followed him , she shivered again . If I am flawed , how can I help anyone ? <p> By birth she had been bounteously blessed or hideously cursed , she did n't know which . It was a secret she had to keep . If the people knew how she was born , they would kill her . <p> Excerpted from ZADAYI RED by Caleb Fox <br> Copyright 2009 by Winifired Blevins and Meredith Blevin <br> Published in July 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates                   @ @
