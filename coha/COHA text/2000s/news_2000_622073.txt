<p> OUT IN the left-field bleachers of Wrigley Field , where the beer and the hard-core knowledge go hand in hand , they have to be asking : Why Sammy Sosa ? Why not Don Baylor ? <p> In a matter of months , Sosa has gone from the pinnacle of baseball status  --  Hall of Fame-style slugger  --  to a pesky gnat in the Cubs ' salad . It 's now a given that he has to leave . Hey , Baylor does n't like him . What , like that 's the final word ? <p> Every team should be so lucky to have a player like Sosa . He goes up there with only one thing in mind : To come right out of his shoes with a vicious swing that will either deliver a 440-foot home run or an awe-inspiring whiff . He 's Rocky Colavito , Frank Howard or Harmon Killebrew , except with even more production and more flair . He 's the worthy foil to Mark McGwire . He 's the very essence of new-century baseball  --  go deep now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this club , except to inherit a reeling , second-division outfit and keep it there ? Not that he does n't have some legitimate concerns . Sosa 's defense is in decline , he 's no longer much of a threat on the bases , and he bulked up into a cartoon-like figure for no good reason over the past two offseasons . Maybe Baylor thinks Sosa opted for steroids , like so many of his brethren ( whether Sosa likes it or not , that 's his reputation within the game ) . But only a no-class manager rips his best player in public . Just as a reminder , that player 's home-run totals were 66 and 63 the last two years . <p> A couple of Chicago sources say this is all nonsense , that Sosa wo n't go anywhere . Others say Baylor has nothing to do with it , that the Cubs ' ownership ( the Tribune Co. ) has decided it does n't want to pay Sosa after Alex Rodriguez gets his $219 trillion next year . But that has n't stopped the madness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal will go down . <p> How it looks from there , and elsewhere : <p> Yankees : Forget the " chemistry " issue or whether Sosa would disrupt the salary structure . The Yankees can work those angles . But the deal does n't make much sense , especially if the Yanks have to give up pitcher Ramiro Mendoza . They need pitching , with Roger Clemens on the disabled list and David Cone throwing old shoes up to the plate . They also need a new second baseman , because Chuck Knoblauch 's throwing phobia has become so acute , manager Joe Torre simply sent him home the other night  --  right after his third error . <p> Red Sox : Do n't forget that Juan Gonzalez , bitter and spent in Detroit , is also available . He 's not real thrilled about big-city , big-pressure environments , which definitely rules out the Yankees . Boston is hardly the lonesome prairie , but he might warm to the idea of playing with Pedro Martinez in a ballpark where the left-field wall looks to be about 200 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sox need to pull the trigger . The Yankees look vulnerable , and this is a chance to steal the pennant . <p> Mets : They have the resources and the desire , but they might be hanging around for A-Rod . With the luxury of including spectacular ( if petulant ) shortstop Rey Ordonez in the deal , they 'll have the inside track in negotiations with Seattle . <p> OUTRIGHT LIES <p> The thing about trade rumors is that they all turn out wrong . Then the blockbuster comes along and it 's a package you never heard about . But there 's an interesting one in Detroit : Gonzalez to the Yankees ( if he 'd agree to it ) in a trade including Drew Henson , a local hero as the University of Michigan quarterback and a sparkling prospect at third base . . . Meanwhile , Dusty Baker 's name is starting to surface elsewhere . The Cleveland Plain Dealer speculated yesterday on GM John Hart 's keen interest in Baker if he ca n't work out a deal with the Giants . . . Flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to play right field in Three Rivers Stadium , once the home of his Puerto Rican hero , Roberto Clemente . Gonzalez was in tears as he ran out to his position . . . In a very big game against the Yankees , Martinez did n't come out for the seventh inning . Seems he 'd reached his " pitch count " of 100 . Weak . That wins you a Cy Young but no respect . . . When it comes to pulled groins , Clemens is the latest in a cast of thousands to go down . How come Early Wynn , Warren Spahn or Jim Bunning never had groin injuries ? How come nobody did ? Did they even have groins back then ? . . . Great line from John Conrad , a member of the Richmond ( Va. ) city council , when the demoted John Rocker showed up : " We have enough loudmouth racists in Richmond already . We do n't need any more . " . . . Check out this blather from Kansas City Royals president Mike Herman : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just organize by regions . Traditional leagues are just a historical thing . By keeping us in these artificial leagues , you make us play games that do n't draw well . " That makes him the official Idiot of the Week . . . Great move by Reggie Miller , blowing off the inevitable hand-touch with a teammate ( Jalen Rose ) before shooting a free throw . If only that became a trend . Ditch the ludicrous high-fives after a guy just shanked one off the front rim . Get the hell out of there and let the man concentrate . . . There was no remorse in Toronto or anywhere else when coach Butch Carter was fired . He hung himself when he sued the Knicks ' Marcus Camby instead of confronting him in person ( or ignoring him altogether ) . . . Got our first look at the L.A. Staples Center last week , and it 's roughly the size of Nevada . It 's all about extravagance and excess and places like The Room , an exclusive bar where floor-seat holders like Dustin Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at halftime . Then you get to the visitors ' locker room and it 's about six inches wide . Twiggy could n't get dressed in there . That used to be cool , in the old nutty barns like Chicago Stadium and Boston Garden . These days , it 's a pitiful oversight . . . If Vince Carter decides he 's fit enough to play the Olympics and Kobe Bryant gets added to the team , then the U.S. team will be watchable . Anything less and it 's straight to the synchronized swimming . . . One of the best things about Steve Young Week : The memorable calls by Lon Simmons , who joins the likes of Bill King ( and damn few others , come to think of it ) as Hall of Fame announcers in two sports . . . Did anyone follow a legend better than Young ? You might have to go back to the early ' 50s , when Mickey Mantle replaced Joe DiMaggio . . . Why the U.S. will never be a legitimate soccer country beyond the kids ' leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of Americans with European connections , gets about eight words in the paper each day . We do n't get it , and we never will . . . So refreshing to hear the measured British voices on Euro 2000 's satellite coverage . Enough of the " Goooooaaaaaal " nonsense . That 's so tired . And it spawned a flock of hideous imitators . . . Golfer David Duval is becoming frighteningly reminiscent of the young Stefan Edberg , in tennis . Edberg used to write off some truly gut-wrenching losses with a shrug and a bland , mindless comment like , " There 's another tournament next week . " Edberg eventually found some fire , and he became a great champion . Maybe it 's not too late for Duval . . . And finally , a lonesome howl in the Pac Bell Park hysteria , from reader Steve Wall : " I 'd rather drink a watered-down Old Milwaukee while watching the A 's hammer the ball and paint the corners than stand in line for a double-latte , low-foam soy milk listening to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of the next inning because I 'm stuck behind some guy with a Web site for a brain .
