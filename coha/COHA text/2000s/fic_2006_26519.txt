The Hero with a Thousand Extra Lives Johnny bit his lip and concentrated . Right .

Fighter No. 4 ! It always came in last , but if you went after it first , the others would have time to turn and you 'd end up in the sights of three of them . He 'd died six times already . And it was only five o'clock . His hands flew over the keyboard . Stars roared past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave him short of fuel , but by the time they caught up , the shields would be back and he 'd be ready , and two of them would already have taken damage , and . . . here they come . . . missiles away , wow , lucky hit on the first one , die die die ! , red fireball  --  swsssh  --  take shield loss while concentrating fire on the next one  --  swsssh  - -  and now the last one was running , but he could outrun it , hit the accelerator  --  ggrrRRRSSHHH  --  and just keep it in his sights while he poured shot after shot into  --  swssh . Ah ! The huge bulk of their capital ship was in the corner of the screen . Level 10 , here we come . . . careful , careful . . . there were no more ships now , so all he had to do was keep out of its range and then sweep in and We wish to talk . Johnny blinked at the message on the screen . We wish to talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the throttle key and slowed himself down , and then turned and got the big red shape in his sights again . We wish to talk . His finger hovered on the Fire button . Then , without really looking , he moved it over to the keyboard and pressed Pause . Then he read the manual . Only You Can Save Mankind , it said on the cover . " Full Sound and Graphics . The Ultimate Game . " A ScreeWee heavy cruiser , it said on page seventeen , could be taken out with seventy-six laser shots . Once you 'd cleared the fighter escort and found a handy spot where the ScreeWee 's guns could n't get you , it was just a matter of time . We wish to talk . Even with the Pause on , the message still flashed on the screen . There was nothing in the manual about messages . Johnny riffled through the pages . It must be one of the New Features the game was Packed With . He put down the book , put his hands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scum/No ! We do not wish to die ! We wish to talk ! It was n't supposed to be like this , was it ? Wobbler Johnson , who 'd given him the disk and photocopied the manual on his dad 's copier , had said that once you 'd completed level 10 , you got given an extra 10,000 points and the Scroll of Valor and moved on to the Arcturus Sector , where there were different ships and more of them . Johnny wanted the Scroll of Valor . Johnny fired the laser one more time . Swsssh . He did n't really know why . It was just because you had the joystick and there was the Fire button and that was what it was for . After all , there was n't a Do n't Fire button . We Surrender ! PLEASE ! He reached over and , very carefully , pressed the Save Game button . The computer whirred and clicked , and then was silent . He did n't play again the whole evening . He did his homework . It was Geography . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dot on the map of the world where you thought it was . The ScreeWee Captain thumped her desk with one of her forelegs . " What ? " The First Officer swallowed and tried to keep her tail held at a respectful angle . " He just vanished again , ma'am , " she said . " But did he accept ? " " No , ma'am . " The Captain drummed the fingers of three hands on the table . She looked slightly like a newt but mainly like an alligator . " But we did n't fire on him ! " " No , ma'am . " " And you sent my message ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " And every time we 've killed him , he comes back . . . . " He caught up with Wobbler in break . Wobbler was the kind of boy who was always picked last when you had to pick teams , although that was all right at the moment as the PE teacher did n't believe in teams because they encouraged competition . He wobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when he ran . Bits of Wobbler headed in various directions ; it was only on average that he was running in any particular direction . But he was good at games . They just were n't the ones that people thought you ought to be good at . If ever there was an Interschool **72;0;TOOLONG , Wobbler would n't just be on the team , he 'd be picking the team . " Yo , Wobbler , " said Johnny . " It 's not cool to say yo anymore , " said Wobbler . " Is it rad to say cool ? " said Johnny . " Cool 's always cool . And no one says rad anymore , either . " Wobbler looked around conspiratorially and then fished a package from his bag . " This is cool . Have a shot at this . " " What is it ? " said Johnny . " I cracked Fighter Star TeraBomber , " said Wobbler . " Only do n't tell anyone , all right ? Just type FSB . It 's not much good , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . well . . . just press the keys , you 'll see what they do . . . . " " Listen . . . you know Only You Can Save Mankind ? " " Still playing that , are you ? " " You did n't , you know , do anything to it , did you ? Um ? Before you gave me a copy ? " Continues ...
