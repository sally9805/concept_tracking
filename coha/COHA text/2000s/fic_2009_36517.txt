1 The Homecoming <p> Amelia Declose settled into her rocking chair on the front porch of the farmhouse she shared with Hannah Parrish and Grace Singleton . Gathering her shawl about her , she knotted the ends across her chest . It was early morning . A glorious sunrise wove its magic across the mountains , slashing the sky with flaming orange . The celery green of new leaves on shrubs and trees and the chirp of a baby bird in a nest artfully camouflaged in a shrub near the porch filled her heart with pure joy . There are days when one feels glad to be alive , and today is one of those days . <p> Amelia 's mind drifted back years ago to when she , Hannah , and Grace had met in a dreary boardinghouse in Pennsylvania where the owner , the dour Olive Pruitt , restricted the use of the kitchen and refused to allow a wonderful cook like Grace to bake a cake or make a pot of soup . <p> They had taken a risk , trusted one another , pooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run-down farmhouse in rural North Carolina that Amelia had unexpectedly inherited , and in so doing had revitalized their lives . Here , Amelia had discovered a talent for photography . Hannah 's skills and love for gardening had resurfaced , and Grace 's kindness and wisdom found their outlet in volunteer work with children and in creating a community of friends and family . <p> Amelia 's finger traced the rim of the delicate china teacup . The human spirit takes comfort and solace from quite ordinary things : cows milling about in a pasture , a comfortable chair like this , the tinkle of wind chimes . <p> A cup of tea with her friends on this porch and Sunday dinners with their ever-increasing surrogate family were now among the happy routines in her life . Even winter , her least favorite season , had become more bearable , with its hot cocoa topped with tiny marshmallows , long hot baths , and snuggling beneath her down comforter . And best of all , Miriam and Sadie were a part of her life  --  her unexpected family . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road , slowed , turned into Max 's driveway across the street , and pulled up to his farmhouse . The short , heavy woman and bearded man who disembarked and plodded up onto the front porch reminded Amelia of Russian immigrants in a movie she had seen recently on late-night television . Several large suitcases were deposited on Max 's front porch , then the taxi rolled away . <p> The man helped the woman to a porch chair , then walked briskly to the front door . Something about him seemed vaguely familiar . She watched as the man carried the luggage into Max and Hannah 's house , then assisted the woman from the chair , and Amelia realized that the woman was very pregnant , not fat . The front door closed behind them and light flooded the downstairs windows . <p> Max 's son and his wife ? <p> Could it be Max 's son and his wife ? No , they live in India . Hannah would have said something , would have been there to greet them . After all , she is Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me most of the time . <p> Shadows moved across Max 's downstairs windows . Who were they ? It was Saturday , Hannah and Max 's private day . Max would never invite anyone to visit on Saturday . <p> Hannah usually stayed at Max 's on Friday nights , but she had been here last night . Grace 's companion , Bob , and Max had come for dinner , and they had all played Trivial Pursuit and talked about getting a dog . Grace had wandered into a shop in Asheville and seen a puppy she 'd fallen in love with and been sorely tempted to bring home . <p> " Why would you want the mess of raising a puppy ? Get an older , house-trained dog from a shelter , " Hannah had said . <p> " Oh , do n't do that . Get a dog from the Compassionate Animal Network . Their members raise the dogs from puppies , " Bob said . " I think you 'd find they 're well socialized , too . When you get a dog from a shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> There had been much talk , but nothing had been decided . <p> Now Amelia 's mind returned to Max 's guests . Max and Hannah 's Saturdays were sacrosanct . Either they drove into Asheville for brunch and to the farmers ' market for fresh fruit and vegetables for both their households , or they sequestered themselves at Max 's house . <p> " What do you do all day ? " Grace had once asked Hannah . <p> " We turn off the phones and just hang out . " Hannah had given Grace a shy smile . " We eat leftovers and ice cream , read , watch old movies , things like that . Once , we sat all day and sorted through old photos that we 'd been meaning to put into an album . One thing we do not do is discuss our work at Bella 's Park . " <br> <p> Across the road , the lights in Max 's downstairs rooms switched off . Amelia went inside , placed her teacup in the kitchen sink , then climbed the stairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hannah ? " <p> " Come in , Amelia . " <p> Hannah sat on the edge of her bed , one foot shoved into her bedroom slipper , the other foot twisted , wiggling under the bed in search of the other slipper . Amelia bent and retrieved it for her . <p> " Ever notice how shoes , especially slippers , are never where you put them when you go to bed ? I think they walk about while we sleep , " Hannah said . " It 's odd . " <p> " What 's odd is that there 's a strange man and a very pregnant woman at Max 's . I was on the porch when a cab deposited them at his front steps . The man opened the front door and walked right in . " <p> Hannah hastened to the window , which overlooked Cove Road . " I do n't see anything or anyone , and there 's no light in Max 's bedroom . " She reached for the buttons on her pajama top . " I 'll go right over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amelia said . " Meet you downstairs . " <p> At the front door , Amelia handed Hannah a mug of black coffee without sugar , and they started across Cove Road . Hannah unlocked the front door , then flipped on the foyer light . There sat three large suitcases . <p> Max 's heavy footsteps sounded on the stairs , and seeing Hannah , he smiled . " I was just about to phone you . Guess who 's here ? " <p> Hannah shook her head . " Who ? " <p> " My son , Zachary , and his wife , Sarina , have come home from India , and she 's about to have a baby . " <p> Hannah was uncertain that she had heard him correctly , but there he stood , beaming and happy . " Zachary , here ? But ... I thought ... ? " <p> " Yes , I know . He said he hated Covington and would never come back , but life is unpredictable . " Taking Hannah 's arm , Max urged her toward the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran his fingers through his hair . " Sometimes things do n't work out as planned . They 've been through hell , from what they 've been telling me . " <p> " What kind of hell ? What 's happened to them ? " Hannah slid into the chair across from Max . Amelia leaned against the wall and waited for his reply . <p> " You know her people are Hindus . Well , it seems there was an issue about a mosque being built on what was considered a Hindu holy site , and this triggered hostilities on both sides . The mayor , a Hindu , was ambushed and killed by God knows who , which led to the looting and burning of a prominent Muslim businessman 's home . After that , it degenerated into a free-for-all . <p> " Sarina 's brother-in-law , the accountant , was shot and wounded in the leg on the way to his office . They think it was a random shooting , but it 's crazy over there , Zachary says , and everyone suddenly has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fled to their home in the south . Just as well , it seems , for after they left , one of their stores was torched . Sarina 's baby is due next month , and they felt they 'd be safer here until the turmoil gets straightened out  --  if it ever does . " <p> " How frightening to live in a world like that , " Amelia said . " People shooting other people , burning property . " <p> " After the Twin Towers going down , I wonder if we 're much safer , or if safety is just an illusion . " Hannah shook her head . <p> " I think of India as a peaceful country , and Hindus as tolerant of all religions , " Amelia said . <p> " This Muslim/Hindu hatred has taken root in many parts of India , " Max said . " No one knows where it will lead . Zachary did the right thing . Sarina will have the baby here . " Satisfaction showed in his eyes . <p> Hannah knew Zachary had been hardheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel and had rejected his father and his father 's business , and had hurt Max deeply . Max had buried the hurt , and despaired of ever seeing any grandchildren . Had Max told Zachary that she and Max were married ? If he had , what had been his son 's reaction ? Hannah did not trust or like Zachary , and she was certain that if his reaction had been positive , it was not sincere . <p> An uneasy feeling settled over her . Their pleasant lives were about to be cast into confusion . <p> Hannah looked at Max . " Have you told Zachary that we 're married ? " <p> Max shook his head . " There 's been no time . Sarina was exhausted , traveling this late in her pregnancy . She collapsed when we got her upstairs . The fright and the stress of it all , leaving her family and home , the trip  --  it was too much for her . We got her into bed , and Zachary took her up some chicken soup . If she relaxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine . " <p> Max reached across the table and lay his large hands over Hannah 's . " You 're trembling . Now , do n't you worry , sweetheart . We 'll tell him about us as soon as he comes down . How can their being here affect us ? We 'll go on with our lives just as we have been . " <p> " Do you really think so ? " Hannah asked . <p> " I 'm sure of it . They 'll stay until the baby comes , then in a few months they 'll move on to a city . " <p> " Do n't be too sure of that . Things change . " The knot in Hannah 's stomach began to hurt.Copyright 2009 by Joan Medlicott <br> Continues ...
