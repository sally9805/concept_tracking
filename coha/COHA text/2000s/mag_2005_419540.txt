In this age of apathy , archaic voting laws , and widespread disenfranchisement , can our Republic ever function as envisioned 225 years ago by the Founding Fathers ? // IN A DEMOCRACY , history is the people 's responsibility . In order for that responsibility to be exercised properly , the electorate must know the issues and understand how the system works . Moreover , citizens have be able to work together to be effective politically ; they have to care enough to vote and to convince others to do the same . These and other issues were discussed at length during the conference , " Making Democracy Work , " at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia . What emerged was a set of prescriptions that , if followed , could increase and enlighten the nation 's electorate , as well as help fulfill the promise of democracy which the Founding Fathers wrote about so eloquently some 225 years ago . So , how can democracy be made to work better ? Halting the disenfranchisement of voters is a good place to start , maintains Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Demos , an organization dedicated to increasing political participation . " The preregistration requirements that every state imposes have no valid basis anymore , " he argues . " Why on Earth does it take state election officials 30 days to figure out whether you are eligible to vote or not ? We have computerized voting processes , and we have the ability to have identification procedures that can work . If you listened to the second of the presidential debates and really got turned on , in 36 states you were already too late . So , we have milu lions of people . . . who would have liked to have voted in the election but were refused purely because of the registration deadline . " There are six states in the country-Maine , New Hampshire , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Idaho , and Wyoming-that have election day registration . In the 2000 election , their voter turnout was 12 points higher than the national average . This is clearly one of the reforms we could do easily that would make a huge difference in the turnout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voting age population is eligible to vote , " which includes 18,000,000 noncitizens and 5,000,000 convicted felons . The latter figure is so high , Rapoport notes , due to " the explosion of the drug wars in the 1980s and 1990s . " Concerning " the felony disenfranchisement issue , every state has different laws , " Rapoport explains . " In Maine and Vermont and Puerto Rico , you never lose your right to vote . In a number of states , you lose your vote in prison , but when you get out you can vote . In eight states , you lose your vote permanently . Just to pick a state at random-in Florida , there are over 600,000 people , according to a lawsuit , who are prohibited from voting . In 2000 , the presidential election was decided in Florida by 537 votes . " Felony disenfranchisement has become a huge exclusion from our democratic process that needs to be changed . Many of these laws , if you look at them very carefully , particularly the ones in the South , have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first passed in 1868 and it was deliberately designed to prevent African-Americans from voting . In the North , it was to prevent blacks and immigrants from voting . " One part of the National Voter Registration Act , passed by Congress in 1993 , requires social service departments to offer people the right to register and vote . The Federal Election Commission keeps the statistics and they are abysmal . Only three to four percent of those who apply for food stamps are being registered . If that figure were even 15 to 20% per year , we 'd have millions of additional people registered . " A major long-term issue then is how do we lower the barriers ? How do we make our system one that encourages people to vote ? I never use the term apathy in regard to voters because , generally , I do n't think it 's the voters fault . I think those of us in the system have the first responsibility to make the system one that welcomes people . If you exclude people because of a felony conviction or put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't then turn around and . . . say , " Gee , is n't it terrible that people do n't vote . ' " Young people are a perfect example . Young people are constantly moving . They are a very transient population , whether they are going to college or leaving home and going elsewhere . That 30-day wait is a tremendous barrier to young people voting , as are the felony convictions . Who are the people who are in jail ? They are not , by and large , older people . They are young people . They are disproportionately male , about nine-to-one male to female ; disproportionately African-American and Latino . " Another solution , asserts Rapoport , " is to make the system one where people have real choices and real things at stake . " He estimates that , because of partisan redistricting , " There were only approximately 30 congressional seats in 2004 that were up for grabs out of 435 . In California , in 2002 , not one seat was seriously contested . The partisan districting had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans and the Democrats entirely based on incumbent protection . So , if you are a rational political theorist in 2002 and there were n't any candidates for governor that you liked , and there were no contested elections for Congress , would it be a rational decision to vote ? " Rapoport also advocates " easier ballot access to third parties . One way to encourage voter participation is a system called instant run-off voting . If you wanted to vote for Ralph Nader because you thought he stood for something important but you knew that by voting for him you were , in fact , helping George Bush , you would be required in effect to cast a vote for someone who is your second choice . In instant run-off voting , which they did in San Francisco in 2004 , you cast a number of ballots and rank them . You vote for your first candidate first , your second choice second , your third , and on and on . The lowest vote-getter is eliminated and then your vote automatically gets transferred to your second choice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you actually have choices that you can make-and this is a reform that can be passed everywhere . " Lastly , " concludes Rapoport , " we desperately need to change our campaign finance system . I can tell you as a former candidate who ran 11 times , it is the single most debilitating part of the political process . People who leave office leave more often than not because they ca n't stand one more round of high-stakes fundraising . It tilts the whole political process toward the concerns of rich people . I ran for Congress in 1988 and the way you raise money is somebody gives you a list of people to call and you sit in a back room somewhere and you spend all night calling strangers . In my case , I was calling the $500 contributors to another Democratic congressman . I made probably 100 calls that night . " Who is it that has the discretionary income to write a $500 check to a political candidate ? I was n't talking to any single mothers who are having trouble with child care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who were making the minimum wage and wanted it raised . I was talking to business people who made money who thought their taxes were too high . I was talking to people who ran car agencies who thought the environmental restrictions were too tough . I was talking to people who thought welfare mothers were getting too much money . Of course , my job in that situation was not to persuade the person that they were wrong , my job was to get the check . " This process , he insists , skews a candidate 's perspective . " If every night you talk to rich people , then the concerns that you think are the concerns of the political process are the concerns of rich people . Why . . . is there no political discussion whatsoever about payroll taxes , which is the largest tax that most working people pay , and yet the issue of the inheritance tax , which is paid by 55,000 families , is at the top of the nation 's political agenda ? It 's because all the political candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need a system where there are both more people voting so that the concerns of those people are heard and a lessened influence of money so that those people with less money are heard . " One such group is African-Americans , who pose an interesting dilemma to elected officials . " If we look around , there is constant rhetoric that is antigovernment . And the thing that 's very odd about it is . . . who needs government more , the rich or the poor ? " asks Lewis R. Gordon , Laura H. Cornell University professor of philosophy and the director of the newly founded Institute for Race and Social Thought at Temple University . " If you 're rich , and there 's no government , what happens to you ? Well , for one thing , you 're not rich anymore . You 'll have money that you can not spend . You 'll have property that 's not recognized . You 'll be completely at the mercy of a world that might be antipathetic to you . Now , suppose you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you are ? Poor . Your circumstance has not really changed . If you 're homeless and there 's no government , you know how to survive under the condition of being homeless . So , we have an ironic situation whereby those who need government most often present themselves as antigovernment . " Gordon also charges that there is a " decline of reason in public life . When Pres. George W. Bush came into office , he had a surplus of nearly three trillion dollars . He spent five trillion dollars and yet presented himself as fiscally conservative , which boggles the mind . Another example : We 've gone through the past four years with policies which reach profound levels of cruelty , yet we hear the word compassion used in public life . When we look at these things all together , anybody who listens to this develops a kind of cynicism , a sense that what is said is something you need to close your ears off from and not listen to it . " Gordon further worries that society at large has closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is the " tendency to look at black Americans as the problem of the society rather than as people who face problems within the society . " If we take the position that our political system is perfect , when we look at the injustices around us , we account for them by making them extraneous to the political system . We call them external factors . Blacks are seen as external to the system . That means , then , there 's nothing wrong with the system ; there 's something wrong with those people . " When we take that position , we create problem people . This leads to a nihilistic situation because , if each time that they try to get their issues addressed , their issues are explained as outside of the system , as always illegitimate , then this creates an environment of political nihilism . This leads to the conclusion that the system is n't for them , so why bother . . . . " I would suggest that we 've constructed a political system that actually depends on making sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system works by having only a small percentage of people participate in it . " How could we address that problem ? What if voting was mandatory ? What if . . . your voter 's registration was filing your income tax ? In that case , we would be saying , " No taxation without representation . ' We 'd be saying if you are contributing to the life of this country , if revenue from your labor is supporting the government of this country , then you should vote . If there were voters on that scale , it would create a de-linking of voting from things like property and a linking of voting to something that everybody has , which is the ability to produce something that can generate revenue . " It 's pretty clear right now that if we have a situation of that kind of access , it would require changing radically the way we understand civil society in the United States . It would mean also having a radically egalitarian conception of participation . For African-Americans , this would say to them that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if blacks are the barometer of what it is to have a people-based politics , and if what democracy is about is a people-based politics , then such a creative response is something we may wish to consider . " Women , too , feel slighted by the system , insists Barbara Di Tullio , director of Women Vote Pennsylvania . " Politicians today are not talking about the issues that women are concerned about , " she says . " They 're not speaking to the issues that concern women every single day . So , why should they vote ? " Nationally , in the 2000 election , 68% of married women voted , but only 52% of single women voted . If single women voted in the same percentage married women voted , there would have been 6,000,000 more votes cast in . . . an election that hinged on less than half a million votes . . . . " When I look at the status of women , and I look at our poor voting rates , to me there can be no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting , politicians can ignore women . If young people are n't voting , politicians can ignore young people . They can ignore people who are economically disadvantaged because , you know , they are just throwaways . " How do we start reversing some of these trends with women ? Women do vote on issues , and do not stay affiliated with a particular party . If a candidate speaks to those issues , women will split their ticket . They 'll vote for the candidate who is addressing their issues . " Recently , " Di Tullio continues , " I got into a discussion with an upper-middle class woman on health care . She said to me , " Well , I do n't care about health care ; I have it . ' It really shook me . I was thinking it was a very self-centered comment , butI did n't want to start lecturing her because this was a young woman whose political participation I wanted to encourage . Yet , from this discussion , I learned that , for each group , we must discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same can be said of young voters ? Chanel Dennis , a senior majoring in American Studies at Temple University , suggests that a deficient education system is to blame for students ' civic apathy . " This is a system where the textbooks are screamingly dull , and where students do not engage in the kinds of activities in school which then lead to involvement later in political life , " she indicates . " The idea that we received from John Dewey and the early educational reformers of learning by doing , learning by engagement , learning by commitment , is no longer characteristic of a school system which is totally preoccupied not with educating students to be good citizens in society , but with a program like No Child Left Behind , simply with passing a set of national exams . " When you think about political participation , you come to realize that students learn by seeing . They learn to care by seeing people teaching them who care about what they are saying . When you go into a school system where the teachers are constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly in a state of inefficacy , it rubs off . Students are looking to someone to be their guiding light , and they are faced with a faculty member or a classroom situation that really limits their opportunities for advancement-not just professionally or academically , but socially and politically as well . " One of the things that steered me into activism at Temple University . . . was having mandatory civics classes in my high school in Delaware . United States and World History were also mandatory courses , and these courses dealt not only with the past , but its effective application in the future . " Dennis continues : " If students do n't get what they need politically in high school , they need to get it in college . . . . On campus , students do talk about issues , many of which are global , such as women 's rights around the world , and Iraq , which was protested for months on end . But despite widespread protest , nothing was changed , and we went to war , a result which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to further apathy . " When one is looking at students who are ready to get out there and make a difference , such students do n't see an opportunity to do that in the United States political system . Where are they going to go when they are concerned about international rights of women ? Or about what will happen to them in their old age ? Which congressman is talking about such things ? Until they start to address the issues that are interesting and important and meaningful to students , then we 're not going to have a politically active student citizenry . " Of course , until you become politically active , nobody pays attention . Until you vote , no one pays attention . How do we keep students engaged who have clearly seen that when they go out and they try and protest and they do what they think is really making the top notch effort to get attention to an issue , and it still does nothing ? That 's where the education comes in . That 's when you go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back to your Introduction to Political Philosophy , or Introduction to American Politics class and say , " Yeah , maybe it does n't work right now , but the system is what we 've got , and the system will work for you if you work it . ' " So what are students to do ? We as students and we as citizens are to use the resources given to us , whether we agree with them or not , " Dennis concludes . " Voting is power . Becoming a group of students , becoming a group of women , becoming a group of citizens , actively participating in elections , actively participating in the political process as it stands now , is the only way to make any change .
