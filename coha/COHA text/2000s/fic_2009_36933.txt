August 1776 <br> Proctor Brown urged his horse into the shallows , fording the Potomac River an hour before sunset . Water splashed up and soaked his shoes ; after ten days in the saddle , with his stockings almost as stiff as his legs , he hardly noticed wet shoes . If he found the Walker farm tonight , he 'd have a chance to dry off and clean up . Assuming he was welcome . <br> The jarring lunge up the far bank reminded him that he was more accustomed to being behind a horse , hitched to a cart or plow , than on top of one . He grunted , shifting weight from his sorest parts to those parts almost as sore . A day of rest could be a good thing . It might take that long to convince Alexandra Walker to return with him to The Farm outside Salem , Massachusetts . It depended on how vividly she remembered the assassins sent to kill them during her last visit . <br> Proctor wanted her help , in case the killers came again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandra was stronger and more experienced than any of the other witches he 'd been able to find this past year . <br> When they reached the road , Proctor 's sturdy little bay mare turned toward the smoke and rooftops a mile away . " No , Singer , the other way , " he said . <br> With a weary toss of her head , Singer circled onto the cart road that led south into the Shenandoah Valley . Even this late in the day , the August air lay on them like a damp wool blanket , one that had been warmed by a fire and filled with biting insects . Land stretched out around them , lush and green , all the way to the mountains . <br> So this was Virginia , the home of General Washington and half the leaders of the Revolution . Last night about this time , Proctor had arrived in McAllister 's Town , Pennsylvania , where the innkeeper at The Sign of the Horse bragged about Thomas Jefferson 's visit the previous April . Jefferson had praised the inn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sausages were good , but Proctor doubted that he 'd slept in the very same room as Jefferson , no matter what the innkeeper claimed . Still , it had been worth the extra half a shilling to get that close to the author of the Declaration of Independence . <br> Proctor pushed back his hat and wiped the sweat from his forehead as he scanned the landscape . He was a bit twitchy , wary even . This was the farthest he had ever been from home . The crickets chuckled at him from the safety of the tall grass that lined the trail . <br> Something rustled through that grass , startling him from his thoughts . Proctor reached for his musket , but by the time he sighted down the barrel , whatever had been there was gone . <br> He tried to convince himself that it was only a stray dog , or maybe a pig loose from some nearby farm . He knew that he 'd been jumpy ever since the battles with the Covenant last year . Being this far from home only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons to be jumpy . As a young man in Massachusetts , he 'd been forced to conceal his talent for magic lest his neighbors turn on him . But ever since the battle at Lexington , he 'd needed that magic to spoil the plots of the Covenant , a mysterious group of European witches who wanted to crush the American rebellion . The Covenant 's ultimate purpose remained hidden , but the stakes were so high that they 'd murdered other American witches and had tried several times to kill Proctor . Not just kill him , but turn the magic in his blood into a curse against American soldiers . <br> He rolled down his sleeves to cover the pink scars on his forearms , a memento from that particular encounter . Thanks to Deborah , he 'd survived and they 'd reversed the Covenant 's spell before the battle at Bunker Hill . <br> Deborah Walcott . Prior to the war , Proctor had been engaged to Emily Rucke , the beautiful daughter of a West Indies merchant , the kind of young woman everyone noticed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept herself plain as a Quaker and tried , like every witch he knew , to go unobserved . <br> What Deborah could n't hide was the spark inside her . When the Congress signed the Declaration of Independence , she perceived the new danger . <br> " The Covenant will strike back hard , " she told Proctor . " Only a third of Americans support the rebellion . If the Covenant can make a mockery of independence and break our will to fight , people will go running back to Mother England like chastened children . " <br> Which was why they needed every witch who could detect or break a spell , including Alexandra Walker  --  who , when they 'd seen her last , wanted nothing to do with magic ever again . <br> One of the farms ahead , rooftops silhouetted against the sky , must be hers . The sudden return of his thoughts to the present caused him to tense . Something was wrong . <br> The crickets had fallen silent . <br> A figure loomed suddenly beside the road , and Proctor raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarecrow , made real by the twilight . <br> As he relaxed , a small flash of light revealed the creature 's distorted face , with intense , malevolent eyes and a sneering mouth . <br> Proctor started in the saddle , jerking on the bridle , and Singer flared her nostrils and came to a stop . The figure that he 'd taken for a scarecrow emerged from the shadows as a man , his face lit red by the hot coal of his pipe . <br> " Good day , " the stranger said , lifting his pipe stem . He wore a pair of calfskin gloves , even in this miserable heat . <br> " Good night is more like it , " Proctor said . It was no wonder he had mistaken the man for a scarecrow . The stranger 's jacket was of foreign cut , plum-colored with relics of silver embroidery on the cuffs and pocket-flaps . A golden velvet waistcoat was mismatched to a red silk scarf tied about his throat . His tattered wig was topped by a ragged bicorn hat sporting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of the motley ensemble . <br> " It 's good to see a young man heading away from the war , instead of rushing off to join the rebels , " the stranger said . His voice was hollow , his accent as odd as his clothes . <br> Proctor bristled . He 'd risked his life in the war , and he had been cut off by his mother for using magic to fight it . He believed it was the right thing for the country and was glad the Declaration of Independence had been issued , even if it meant renewed fighting . <br> " I 've served as a minuteman and would rather be thought a patriot than a rebel , " Proctor said . " Do you have something against independence ? " <br> " No , just against  --  " He puffed out a cloud of tobacco smoke , pausing as he searched for the right word . "  --  pointless bloodshed . No offense intended , young man . " <br> " None taken , " Proctor said , though the young man irritated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did when strange dogs came too close . It would be best to move on . " I 'm looking for the Walker farm . You would n't happen to know where it is ? " <br> " The Walker farm ? " A smile spread slowly across the stranger 's face . " That 's a coincidence . I 've just come from the Walker farm . Follow the trail up to the big oak with the blaze on it . Then turn to the left and climb over the hill . That 's where you 'll find it . " <br> " Is it far ? " Proctor asked . He wondered how the stranger knew the Walkers . The way Alexandra talked , her parents and brothers were all ardent patriots . <br> " It 's a mile , maybe a bit more , " the stranger said . " Be careful or you 'll miss it in the dark . " <br> " May I have your name ? " Proctor asked . " So that I may remember your kindness to me to the Walkers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew out another small cloud of smoke . " Bootzamon , " he said finally . He chuckled , as if at some private joke . " Folks around here call me Bootzamon . " <br> " Thank you , Mister Bootzamon , " Proctor said . With a tip of his hat , and more than a bit of relief , he kicked Singer 's sides and headed up the trail . <br> A hundred feet on , he stole a glance over his shoulder . For a second Bootzamon once again appeared to be a scarecrow standing at the edge of the road . Then the coal flared in his pipe , destroying the fancy , and Proctor turned away from the strange man . <br> He followed the ruts of the road to the blazed oak standing on the little knoll just where Bootzamon said it would be . Proctor tried to stand in the saddle to look through the trees for some sign of a house , but soreness constrained him to craning his neck . The wind shifted and brought to his nose the scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger had probably refilled his tobacco pouch at the Walkers . <br> He rode down the trail until the dark shape of a primitive house emerged from the trees . Rough-hewn logs , chinked with mud and stones , supported a roof with a single chimney . The plank door stood wide open , but no light shone within . <br> The hairs tingled on the back of Proctor 's neck . He reached into his pocket for a handful of salt , in case he needed to cast a quick protective spell . <br> " Hello , " Proctor shouted . " Alexandra . Mister Walker , Missus Walker . " His voice carried past the house , bringing back no reply but the chirping of the crickets . <br> Nothing appeared wrong . The garden looked well tended , as much as he could see of it in the twilight beyond the split-rail fence . So did the field of corn just past the house . <br> He dismounted slowly , grunting as he hit the ground . After tying Singer to a narrow stump that seemed meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from a dugout log  --  he limped over to the house . <br> " Hello , " he cried again , leaning into the open door . <br> Something smelled wrong , sharp and metallic , but the smoke-stench from the hearth overwhelmed it . It was too dark to see anything without a light . He suddenly wished that he 'd done a scrying before continuing his journey today , but he had n't seen a need and he hated to risk doing magic where he might be caught . <br> He stepped cautiously inside . <br> " Hello ! Is anyone home ? " <br> Nothing . <br> His nose wrinkled again at the smell . The shadows within marked out two rooms . He stepped into the one on his left and slipped in something on the floor . His shoulder banged the wall , but he caught himself before falling . <br> He rubbed his sore shoulder . A few coals glowed red in the hearth , enough to start a fire for some light . He still had that wary itch at the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bootzamon fellow had just been here , and he 'd mentioned nothing wrong . <br> Proctor shuffled forward , moving his feet carefully to keep from slipping again or tripping over some stray piece of furniture . When he reached the hearth , he groped in the dark until he found the iron poker . He repeated the effort until he located the basket of tinder and wood . Using the poker to stir the coals , he blew on them and fed them dried twigs and branches until they leapt into flames . <br> Outside , Singer whinnied . Proctor knew he needed to go out and remove the mare 's saddle and rub her down . Or maybe it was the Walkers returning . <br> " Hello , in here ! " Proctor called . He added wood to the fire and prodded the coals until the room glowed orange and red . <br> Singer whinnied again . Proctor turned his head toward the door , conscious that the crickets had fallen silent . <br> His gaze shifted from the door to the room . <br> Not all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The iron clattered off the stone hearth as he dropped it . Blood was smeared everywhere . He checked the bottom of his shoe  --  he 'd slipped in a pool of wet blood on his way in . It was fresh . A woman 's body lay under the table . The top of her head was missing . A man 's broken body , cut to bloody ribbons , was folded against the wall . <br> " Jesus , " Proctor whispered . <br> " Funny , that 's who they called on too , " said a voice that made Proctor jump again . <br> Bootzamon stood framed in the doorway . For just a second he looked like a scarecrow . Then his pipe flared , and he blew out a stream of smoke . <br> " Mister Bootzamon , " Proctor said , trying hard to keep his voice steady . " What happened here ? " <br> Bootzamon shook his head sadly . " It appears to be an Indian attack . Exactly how old are you , young man ? " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflex . He looked for a way past Bootzamon , remembering that the Covenant 's assassins had come to The Farm dressed as Indians last year . " What makes you say it 's Indians ? " <br> " See , that 's too bad , " Bootzamon said . " My master wants young witches only . ' Catch the young ones , kill the old . ' I could n't find the Walker girl , but I got to thinking you might be young enough to take her place . " <br> His cockfeather brushed the lintel as he stepped through the door . One arm hung at his side , the gloved hand casually dangling a bloody tomahawk . <br> Proctor saw the weapon , but he felt magic tickle the back of his neck . Worse than murder had been done here already . He reached into his pocket for his bag of salt while his thoughts raced for the right protective spell . Keeping his eye on Bootzamon , he sprinkled salt in a quick circle around himself . " The Lord is my rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enemy  --  " <br> " Bosh , " Bootzamon said around the pipe stem in his lips . He removed the pipe and blew smoke toward Proctor . A wind slammed through the house , banging open the window shutters and scattering Proctor 's circle of salt . <br> The wind died , and Bootzamon stood there , tapping the tomahawk against his palm . <br> " You 're a witch , " Proctor whispered , and then felt foolish for saying it . His own use of magic was too slow , too useless for this kind of fight . He bent down quickly and snatched up the iron . <br> " Not precisely a witch , " Bootzamon said . " But I may be a ghost  --  boo ! " <br> Proctor twitched . <br> Bootzamon chuckled and danced closer to Proctor . " Or I may be an Indian . " The last word came out with a sneer as he swung the tomahawk at Proctor 's head . <br> Proctor banged the tomahawk aside with the iron , then reversed his swing and slammed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bag of sticks and straw . The tomahawk flew one way and Bootzamon the other . He hit the far wall , crumpled to the floor , and then popped up again , pipe in mouth . He reached up and recocked his hat , then licked his gloved finger and ran it along the edge of the feather . <br> " What are you ? " Proctor asked . <br> " What are you ? " Bootzamon retorted . " I 'll tell you what you are  --  you 're nothing but a miserable bag of snot and bones , piss and Scheie . And , sadly , too old to be of use to me . " <br> Bootzamon stretched his hand toward the tomahawk . The weapon slid toward him across the floor , the blade scratching a line through the blood , and flew up into his hand . The flickering light from the fire cast a sinister glare over his features , distending and exaggerating them . <br> He blocked the only path to the door . <br> Fear shot through Proctor like fire through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open window . He slammed into the ground , and the air crashed out of him , but somehow he held on to the poker . <br> Singer snorted . <br> Bootzamon flew through the window and landed nimbly on his feet next to Proctor . <br> Proctor rolled away , rising , swinging the poker as he stumbled upright . Bootzamon was either a witch , doing magic , or he was a creature made from magic , like the animated corpses that had attacked Proctor and Deborah on The Farm that dark night the year before . Either way , the magic had a focus . Break the focus , break the spell . <br> He retreated around the corner of the house , watching Bootzamon follow him with an almost casual step . The coal from the pipe cast a thread of light along the cockfeather in his hat . Roosters were the focus of all sorts of black magic . The cockfeather must be the focus  --  it made perfect sense . <br> " I smell you , " Bootzamon said . " Even a corncob nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death on you . " He pulled the pipe from his mouth and held it down at his side . " I smell you  --  " <br> Proctor lunged and knocked the hat off Bootzamon 's head , dodging the tomahawk as it swung at him . Holding the iron bar in front of him like a shield , Proctor snatched up the hat and yanked out the feather , crushing it in his fist . <br> Bootzamon stood there , unfazed . <br> " If you think my hat looks better than your own , you 're welcome to it , " he said , jamming the pipe in his mouth . " It can cover your naked skull once I peel off your scalp . " <br> " The feather 's not the focus ? " Proctor said , stunned . But then what was  --  ? <br> Bootzamon laughed . He made a quick lunge toward Proctor . It would have been deadly but the creature froze mid-step . The dark light in his eyes began to fade , and his body suddenly grew more lumpy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was extinguished . <br> " Dickon ! " Bootzamon cried . <br> A horned , man-shaped shadow the size of a cat swirled up out of the earth . Its left fist was closed around a burning coal that illuminated a webwork of veins in the back of its hand . With a screech of anguish , it smashed the coal into the pipe . Then it disappeared in an upward spiral of smoke , leaving behind the stink of saltpeter and brimstone . Proctor suppressed a shudder of revulsion  --  it was one thing to believe in imps and demons , but another thing entirely to see one summoned by name . <br> Bootzamon drew deep on the relit pipe and puffed out another noxious cloud of cheap tobacco . <br> The pipe . Of course . Proctor should have guessed that first . He could try to smash it , but he did n't think he 'd get a second chance to hit Bootzamon in the head . He backed away , slowly , measuring his step , making sure of his footing . If he went around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Singer . <br> Bootzamon chuckled at him , then coiled and made a leap that carried him over Proctor 's head . Proctor ducked , swinging the iron wildly . When Bootzamon landed , Proctor charged him . <br> The creature leapt back again , another fifteen feet , and held out his arm , the tomahawk hanging limp in his hand . <br> " What are you going to do ? " Bootzamon taunted . " If you break me , my master can put me back together . If you destroy my limbs , I can find replacements . " The tomahawk snapped upright in his fist . " You , on the other hand , are neither so durable nor so easily repaired . " <br> His arm snapped back , and he threw the tomahawk at Proctor , who twisted aside , dodging it easily . Now was his chance  --  he charged at Bootzamon . <br> Something in the glitter of the dark eyes warned him . <br> He ducked as the tomahawk returned , passing through the space his head had just occupied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " Ah , that worked on the woman , " Bootzamon said , sounding either pleased or disappointed . <br> Proctor circled to the right . <br> " You would n't know where I could find the girl , would you ? " Bootzamon said , dancing jauntily from side to side , holding the tomahawk ready to strike . " I could promise to make it quicker for you if you tell me  --  " <br> Proctor attacked in the middle of Bootzamon 's sentence , and the creature reacted by leaping backward again . <br> " It 's not polite to interrupt  --  " Bootzamon said as he landed next to Singer . <br> He was interrupted by the mare , who lashed out with her rear hooves the instant he landed . The blow sent Bootzamon flying off in several directions  --  an arm one way , body another , pipe a third . <br> Proctor dropped the poker and dived for the pipe . <br> Bootzamon popped up to his feet and swung an empty shoulder socket toward his life spark . His other hand still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he growled . <br> " You did n't say please , " Proctor said . He snapped the pipe in half . <br> " You stinking peasant farmer  --  " <br> The words died on the creature 's lips . His head shrank to a dried gourd with a corncob nose , his remaining arm flopped loose like a broken flail , and his legs turned stiff , not bending at the knees . He ran straight-legged for Proctor , raising the tomahawk above his head in a wordless scream . <br> Proctor plunged his hand into the trough . Steam boiled up around his fist as the pipe was extinguished , and Proctor jerked his hand out with a yelp . <br> Gourd , scarf , clothes , and straw fell in a jumble at Proctor 's feet . The tomahawk slid across the ground to the edge of his bloody-soled shoe . <br> In the grasses nearby , a cricket ventured a chirp . <br> Proctor shook his hand . His knuckles hurt , as if he 'd punched someone in the jaw . After retrieving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broomstick , an old thresher 's flail , and pieces of chair legs knotted together formed Bootzamon 's scarecrow bones . Only when Proctor had knocked them apart did he dare breathe easily . <br> The sound of the crickets rose in grateful chorus . <br> He went over to Singer . She had froth around her mouth , but her eyes were calm again . Proctor stroked her neck and fetched a handful of oats from his saddlebag . As she nibbled from his palm , Proctor said , " Thanks . " <br> Singer rubbed her head against Proctor 's shoulder and pulled at her tether . He gave her another handful of oats . <br> Unfortunately , he was n't done here just yet . He took a long look at the pieces of the scarecrow scattered on the ground . It was so dark now , he was n't sure he could see them all . Was n't sure they had n't moved or collected themselves . <br> The fire in the cabin had faded , leaving no more than a dim glow through the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull and backbone  --  Proctor carried the pieces inside and shoved them one by one into the flames until the creature was completely destroyed . If he concentrated on the work and watched where he put his feet , he did n't have to look too closely at the dead bodies . <br> Still , by the time he fed the last bits of straw into the fire , he had seen enough . The woman had auburn hair , the same color as Alexandra 's ; the man was lean and broad- shouldered , just the way she 'd described her father . Though he turned out Bootzamon 's pockets before burning the clothes , he had not discovered the missing scalps and could not give the bodies the final dignity of being complete . With the stink of burned wool and silk strong in his nose , he searched the second room and the sleeping loft , but he found no sign of Alexandra or her several brothers . <br> He stood in the doorway and leaned his head against the jamb , breathing fresh air and staring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be devastated , just as Deborah had been when the Covenant killed her parents . <br> Deborah ! What was the phrase that Bootzamon had used ? Catch the young witches and kill the old . The Cove ? nant knew the location of The Farm . If Bootzamon had been sent after Alexandra , then The Farm was n't safe . He had to get back home now . <br> He retrieved a purse full of salt from one of his saddlebags , brought with him to create a protective circle around him as he slept . He used nearly all he had left around the perimeter of the small house , saying , " Let there be no remembrance of former things , neither let there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those who shall come after . " <br> The words trickled out of his mouth like the salt from his fist , starting over again each time he dipped his hand in for more . Anyone who came here now would turn away , forgetting why they came . The house would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . <br> When he finished , he stood at the door and whispered a silent prayer to God , begging His forgiveness and asking Him to consecrate the bodies inside in place of a proper burial . All his aches and soreness , forgotten during the fight with Bootzamon , came rushing back , amplified by his new bruises . Night was no time to travel , but he could n't stay here . <br> He walked toward Singer and found her at the end of her tether , well away from the trough . <br> A red light glowed in the bottom of the water . The pipe . <br> Proctor plunged his hand into the water , still teakettle-warm . He fished out the broken bowl-end of the pipe and took it to the splitting stump . Using the heaviest piece of firewood he could find , he smashed the pipe into pieces . Then he took the butt-end of the log and ground even the pieces into dust until there was no flame left . <br> " Good night , Mister Bootzamon , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and did n't see it . He knew better , but it was still unsettling . Deborah had done a good job teaching him after all . <br> Proctor walked over to Singer and climbed back into the saddle . She seemed as eager to leave the farm as he was . They had to push through the thick , oppressive air and the dark to find the cart road and turn north again . About an hour later , they came to the ford on the Potomac . <br> " Did n't think we 'd be back again so soon , " Proctor said . <br> Singer plunged down the bank and splashed into the water . Proctor rubbed his eyes to stay awake as they crossed . Five hundred miles away , Deborah and the other witches were in danger already . And they did n't know what was coming . <br> Continues ...
