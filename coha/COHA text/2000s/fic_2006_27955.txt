The Kept Woman By Donovan , Susan St. Martin 's Paperbacks Donovan , Susan The low hum of music and laughter droned in Samantha Monroe 's ears , and she began to feel woozy . Maybe it was the two margaritas . Maybe it was the hellish week she 'd just put in at the salon . Maybe it was the latest threatening letter from Wee Ones Academy beginning with the ominous sentence : " Due to your child 's unresolved toileting issues , we must ask you to find other daycare arrangements within two weeks . " " . . . and then , you 're not going to believe this ! " Sam 's best friend , Mont , continued entertaining the table with her blow-by-blow of last Saturday 's date with the Mad Unzipper . Since Sam was quite familiar with the tale , she let her eyes wander through the happy-hour crowd at the Lizard Lounge , noticing the group of young , carefree women at the bar , enjoying life , and she had to wonder . . . had she ever looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy as those girls clearly did ? Did she ever wear spike heels that high ? Was she ever that young ? Should she call Lily again to make sure Dakota ate his fish sticks and that Greg did n't indulge in more than an hour of PlayStation ? " . . . and the man just stands his ass up from the couch , unzips , and says , ' Mont baby , I got your python right here ! ' " The explosion of laughter made Sam smile to herself , and she returned herattention to her friends . She loved each woman at that table , even if their behavior was bordering on obnoxious . That was the whole point of their Drinks &; Depression Nights , anyway . The last Friday of every month , they 'd have a couple drinks , bitch about work , life , love ( or the lack thereof ) , and laugh a lot . Then make plans for the next time . Sam looked past the zebra-striped upholstered lounge chairs and out the picture window . It was a wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first snow was spitting down on the streets of Indianapolis . It was nearly pitch-dark by six o'clock these days . The holidays were just around the corner . No wonder tonight 's group consisted of only the most hard-core D &; D Night attendees . Sam glanced to her right to watch Mont McQueen tell her story , her black braids swinging with the rhythm of her words . Mont had been her coworker for thirteen long years at Le Cirque . She was a damn fine stylist and the most steadfast friend Sam had ever had . When Mitchell left three years ago , Mont had held Sam 's hand and advised her that a woman with kids did n't have the luxury of giving up . Mont certainly knew of what she spoke . To Sam 's left was Kara DeMarinis , one of her most loyal clients , looking fabulous and powerful in her usual fabulous power suit yet managing to be one of the most down-to-earth people around . Also at the table were Le Cirque owner and general business goddess Marcia Fishbacher and veteran salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly divergent lifestyles . And every one of these women was howling with laughter and smacking her palms on the tabletop at Mont 's story . Every one but Sam . She knew she should force herself to be more cheerful tonight , because these get-togethers were her therapy . Unfortunately , she was too damn tired for cheerful . She was too tired for therapy . In fact , Sam knew that if the most gorgeous man-babe in the world were to saunter through the front door of the Lizard Lounge at that very instant , partially clothed and completely raring to go , she 'd be too tired for him , too . With a sigh , Sam managed to use her last bit of energy to order an unheard-of third margarita , and when it arrived , she ran the tip of her numb tongue along the freezing cold glass , scooping up a few coarse grains of salt . As she swallowed what would be her only solid food of the evening , a variety of concerns wafted through her weary , tequila-soaked brain . Rent was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed the garbage disposal as promised -- so would she face eviction if she refused to pay ? Lily was still gunning to go to France with her class next year , but where the hell was Sam going to get an extra three thousand dollars to send her there ? And Greg refused to get back into speech therapy , deciding the stutter itself was less painful than the teasing his classmates gave him for going to a " special " class . Sam took another sip -- a gulp , really -- and felt her insides wash with the heat of the alcohol . Her mouth began to move . " I never did understand what is so wrong with being a kept woman , " she muttered . " If I could find a way to do it without damaging the kids , I 'd gladly live in a penthouse with a chauffeur and a maid and a chef in exchange for giving some old geezer a little nooky every once in a while . I mean , where 's the harm in that ? " Dead quiet settled over the table , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kara gripped Sam 's upper arm and stared at her with big , brown eyes . " If he 's not too old or geezery , of course , " Sam added as clarification . " Well , sure . " Marcia rolled her eyes . " A girl 's got ta have her standards . " " Tell me if the old coot has a brother , " Denny said . " I could use a sugar daddy myself , and it certainly would n't hurt if he was partial to lesbians . " " I do n't think lesbians have sugar daddies , " Wanda told her sister . " I 'm cuttin ' you off , Sam . " Mont pried the stem of the margarita glass from Sam 's tingling fingers . " And I 'm drivin ' you home and puttin ' you to bed . We have a wedding party coming in for updos and makeup at nine tomorrow and you need your rest . " " God . I just haaaate weddings , " Sam moaned . " I hate brides . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that freakin ' happiness , and at nine in the morning ! It 's just not natural ! I want to grab those brides by their shoulders and shout , ' Do n't do it ! Run away ! Run before it 's too late ! ' " Marcia blinked in concern , and Sam was making a mental note to never again have more than two drinks in the presence of her boss when Mont scooped her from her chair and stood her on her feet . " C'm on , Cinderella . Time to take a ride in the carriage before it turns into a big , fat pumpkin . " Kara DeMarinis leaned back in the leather armchair and studied Jack Tolliver at leisure , aware there was n't a woman in the world who would classify the man as geezery . Oh , she 'd heard him called a few other choice things over the years , such as misogynist asshole , arrogant dickhead , and booty-call bastard , but never geezer . So at least that was one hurdle she 'd already cleared . Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antique cherry desk that once had belonged to his father , the late , great Indiana governor Gordon Tolliver . Jack shook his dark head and wiped his eyes . Apparently , Kara 's suggestion had made him laugh so hard he 'd cried . " I 've always loved the way you think outside the box , but Kara , babes , you 're thinking outside the known universe with this one . " " It 's doable , Jack . Remember when Errol Binder borrowed a neighbor 's golden retriever for his publicity shots ? The man hated pets . And how about when Charleton Manheimer used his press secretary 's kids to stand in for his own grandchildren in that thirty-second public education spot ? The grandkids were in boarding school in Vermont . " Jack blinked . " No way . " " Yes . So there 's some precedent for this . And I 've known Samantha Monroe for twelve years . She 's great . She 's hardworking and responsible and middle-class -- everything you 're not . And she deserves a break . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infamous lips of his . " You can not be implying that I 'm an irresponsible trust-fund slacker . " Kara smiled back at him cheerfully . " Well , you are . " " Fine , but if we 're being blunt , then let me just remind you that no woman is perfect , especially the ones that you can buy . " " She 's not for sale . She would be more of a rental . " Jack produced another hearty laugh . " Good God , Kara ! I will not rent a fake fiance ! It is immoral and reprehensible , not to mention pathetic ! " Jack raked his large hands through his waves of dark hair , pushed himself up from the desk , and turned his back to Kara . He began to pace through the office as he thought aloud . " Besides , if I want to benefit from her strengths , I 'll have to eat her weaknesses , wo n't I ? Does she have a criminal record ? Speeding tickets ? How about her credit rating ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself , watching the sway of Jack 's muscular bottom as he paced , the way the wide ledge of his shoulders rolled with each step . She knew there was no man less in need of dating intervention than Juicy Jack Tolliver . But Kara also knew that at this crucial point in his political career the emphasis needed to be on the quality of the women in his life , not the quantity , and Jack 's tendency to focus on the latter had suddenly become a bigger liability than ever . " I 've already started opposition research on Samantha -- anything and everything your challengers could come up with I 've got covered . So far , a spotty credit rating after her divorce is all I 'm seeing , and that 's understandable . Makes her more sympathetic even . " Jack shook his head , still facing away from Kara . He spoke so softly she could barely hear him . " What about Tina ? Damn . She was a redhead . You know how I love redheads . " " You 've only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real good month . " " She 's a twenty-five-year-old belly dancer , Jack , which may be entertaining to you personally but wo n't exactly send the right message to voters . Besides , I do n't think she 's a natural redhead . " " The color might be from a bottle , but it looks good on her . And for the record , Tina is a pediatric nurse who only moonlights as a belly dancer . And she 's incredibly flexible . " " Good . Then she 'll recover nicely when you break up with her . " " No one 's going to believe I 'm engaged anyway . " Jack chuckled , staring up in exasperation at the room 's ornate pressed-tin ceiling . " I 'm just supposed to wake up one day and bam !  - -  I 'm suddenly overcome with the urge to commit ? Please . Who 's going to believe that crap ? " " People change , Jack . The voters would accept that you 've matured , that you found the right woman and decided to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He glanced over his shoulder , one eyebrow arched , a green eye narrowed at her in doubt . " And there 's plenty of time before the primary , " Kara continued . " A dinner here , a basketball game there , an anonymous tip to the Star 's city desk , and pretty soon you 've got a blossoming romance in place before the February filing deadline . It does n't look rushed . And you 're golden . " " Or I 'm dead meat . " Jack whipped around . " Surely you realize I 'd be nailing down my own coffin lid if someone discovers this little business transaction ? Maybe , I do n't know , someone like Christy Schoen ? " Kara had anticipated this concern , and she nodded crisply . " I will micromanage the hell out of the media . I will personally keep Christy on a short leash . " Jack roared . " Careful . That little bitch will yank your arm right out of its socket sniffing out a lead story for Capitol Update . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Sunday TV show more times than she could count , and she knew all about the journalist 's pathological disdain for Jack . Kara could n't exactly blame her -- no woman likes to get kicked to the curb in public . " You really were a real ass to Christy , you know . " " Yes , I was . But pardon me if I feel the time for apologizing is long gone . " " Well , we 'll handle Christy , because we have to , " Kara said . " As for the rest of the media , the secret will be a light touch . A little public exposure will go a long way with this . And you can always explain that Samantha and the children treasure their privacy . " " Children ? " Jack 's eyes went huge . " This rental woman comes with children ? " Kara shrugged good-naturedly . She knew this part would be the hardest for Jack , but it was also the piece that was going to appeal most to voters . " Three kids . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota , is the cutest little --  " " Stop right there . " Jack began laughing again , and this time his chortle had an edge of madness to it . " Sure , I 'd like to be the newest senator from Indiana . I 'd like that just fine . But Kara , there will be no babies rented in order to get me there . No kids . This is insane . " Kara waved a manicured finger in the air . " Think about it , Jack . What would scream reformed more than having a hardworking divorced hairstylist and her three kids at your side ? You can play it down . Let the voters make their own inferences . I 'm telling you . It will work fabulously . " " Absolutely not . " Jack shoved his hands down into the front pockets of his chinos and glared at her . " And I would think that after four campaigns and twenty years you 'd know me better than that . " Kara tilted her head and paused for a moment , then sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your longtime campaign manager and dear friend , I can tell you the truth , and the truth is that you 've just been handed your last shot . Allen Ditto 's decision not to run for the Senate again is a gift , and if you do n't make it happen now , you never will . " " That 's just one possible scenario . " " It is the only one . " Kara eased out of her chair and walked to where he stood by the wall of bookcases . She gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder . " Look , Jack , it 's been four years since you ended your lieutenant governor gig and two years since Christy helped the voters decide you were a punk-ass , sexist pig not fit for the Seventh District congressional seat . " Jack winced . " Every focus group and poll we 've commissioned has said the same thing -- voters want to support you , but they ca n't get over your reputation as a player , especially women voters . That 's all that 's keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tolliver name still opens checkbooks -- and we 're already well on our way to the three million it will take for this campaign . But honestly , I do n't think there 's enough money in Fort Knox to get you elected unless you make a gesture of the grandest kind . " Jack squeezed his eyes shut and let out a hiss of disgust . Kara was pretty sure it was self-directed . " You 've got to show voters that you 're not the same man who was caught ogling a speaker 's booty at a teachers ' convention two years ago ! They have to see that you 've changed . That you have a new perspective on life and family and can better represent hardworking Hoosiers in our nation 's capital . " Kara paused , making sure Jack was following along . He seemed less pissed , so she continued . " It 's creative campaign strategy . It 's a business arrangement . It 's a way to tweak your private life into shape on incredibly short notice . " " Oh my God , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Sam Monroe and her kids hang around for six months or so , then after the primary you can have a quiet , amicable breakup and , once again , ask that the public respect her privacy . No one gets hurt . " " And how could we be sure she would n't talk ? " " A simple nondisclosure clause . If she talks , she has to give back the money , and she 'll want that money . Trust me . " " Uh-huh . " " And think about it ! Remember how Manheimer droned on at that homeless roundtable about how the Tollivers were too rich to identify with those in need and even owned a mansion that no one even lived in ? Hey -- Sam and the kids could move in here . It would be seen as an act of compassion and generosity . Am I a genius or what ? " Kara watched Jack chew his lip . She watched his fiercely intelligent green eyes scan his surroundings , calculating the truth of her observations , weighing the risks of her plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack since their freshman year in Bloomington . Jack was sharp . He was a man who could think on his feet , keep a clear view of what was critically important , and make his move right in the nick of time . It 's what had once made him the NFL 's hottest quarterback . It 's what made him a natural politician , like his father and his father before him . Kara waited for Jack to say something -- anything . Finally , after what seemed like an eternity , Jack 's bright green eyes flashed and he gave her a decisive nod , exhibiting the kind of clarity of purpose he 'd need to pull this off . At that moment , Kara felt truly proud of Jack the politician -- and Jack the man -- and waited for his pronouncement . " By any chance , is this woman a redhead ?
