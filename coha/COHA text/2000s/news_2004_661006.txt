<p> Duck inside Pratt Diagnostic Clinic in Boston and you 'll find a cozy lobby with wood accents and stuffed sofas . There 's coffee and pastries for those who 'd like a snack , and the staff is cordial and businesslike . Can this quiet , uncrowded place really be a doctor 's waiting room ? <p> That 's just what it is - though the serene ambiance comes with a price tag . For a $ 1,800 annual fee beyond what health insurance or Medicare pay , patients receive amenities such as 24-hour access to their physician by pager or cellphone , a promise of same- or next-day appointments , no more than a 15-minute wait to see the doctor ( leaving little time to enjoy the plush waiting room ) , physical exams that include extra tests - and even a personal CD-ROM of their health records . <p> Among the hundreds of thousands of doctors in the United States , perhaps only several hundred are " concierge " or " boutique " physicians . But those in the field say interest in this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend more time with patients and from patients who want a higher level of medical service than they feel they get under Medicare or private health insurers . <p> Of course , concierge practices ca n't claim to offer better medical care - not if they want to remain eligible to receive money from Medicare or private insurers , who expect all doctors to provide high-quality care . So rather than emphasizing basic services , they play up the extras and amenities . <p> If this trend picks up , some observers worry American healthcare could move toward a three-tiered system : high-quality care for those who pay extra , less-than- optimum service for those covered by ordinary private or government insurance programs , and spotty healthcare for the more than 40 million Americans without health insurance . <p> " It makes it look like America is becoming less equity-oriented and more market-oriented in that people with money will get more healthcare faster , and people without it will face more barriers , " says Dr. Robert Blendon , a professor of health policy at Harvard University 's School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare idea that everybody would be treated the same with a Medicare card . " <p> The idea of those with means paying more for better healthcare is expanding around the world , Dr. Blendon says , with the exception of Canada , where that approach is illegal . In countries that provide national healthcare , about 15 percent of people opt to pay for additional insurance to receive extras like private hospital rooms or faster elective surgeries , he says . <p> Those setting up concierge practices in the US say they 're not neglecting the poor but rather responding to patients ' demands for a bit more " Marcus Welby " - style personal care in modern medicine . <p> " The current model of healthcare delivery , particularly in the primary-care setting , is dysfunctional , to say the least , " says Dr. John Blanchard , president and cofounder of the year-old American Society of Concierge Physicians in Grand Rapids , Mich . Patients today have begun to " feel like a number , " he says . " You 're shuttled through offices like cattle . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of healthcare is based largely on the integrity of the patient-physician relationship - and that relationship breaks down in a high-volume healthcare setting . " <p> At Pratt , a nonprofit practice that introduced the concierge concept in December , patient fees do n't line the pockets of its doctors . Instead , profits will be plowed back into the operating deficit of Tufts-New England Medical Center ( NEMC ) , the money-losing teaching hospital that it is part of . So far , Pratt has about 250 patients and would need 400 or more to turn a profit . <p> Two hundred years ago , Tufts-NEMC was known as the Boston Dispensary , which treated the wealthy for a fee and used that money to subsidize care of the poor , says Dr. Deeb Salem , the hospital 's chief of medicine , who hopes to use the concierge concept in the same way today . Now visitors from other teaching hospitals are coming to see how Pratt is doing it , he says . <p> For Pratt patient Kim Sawyer , knowing that profits will be " going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current financial environment " was crucial to her decision to join , she says . As a principal at a small financial services firm , " I have an absolutely crazy , crazy work schedule , " she says . Now she can easily reschedule a doctor 's appointment and know that , when she arrives , she 'll be seen quickly and then can get on with her day . <p> She fits the profile of many of Pratt 's clients , says Dr. Bruce Cohen , who heads the clinic 's four-doctor team . Other patients have complicated medical histories and want to make use of the extra time for consultation . Others are interested in wellness programs and learning about steps they can take to prevent illnesses . <p> None of the Pratt doctors has abandoned previous patients or demanded that their patients join Pratt . Dr. Cohen spends about half his time seeing his 1,200 regular patients and the other half on 85 Pratt patients ( Pratt hopes that number will grow to 250 to 300 patients per doctor ) . He schedules 30 to 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an hour ( or more if needed ) for his Pratt patients . " It is very nice to have a little more time with the patient and occasionally you pick up something about them that you otherwise might not have picked up , " he says . <p> Pratt belongs to MDVIP , a marketing service for concierge physicians . The company in Boca Raton , Fla. , has about 50 member physicians and is adding three or four a month , says Wayne Lipton , MDVIP 's senior vice president . <p> It also counsels members how to stay out of legal trouble with Medicare . In a March 31 alert , the Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) of the US Department of Health and Human Services warned doctors against charging extra for services already covered under Medicare . In one case the OIG cited , a physician charged $ 600 per year to provide patients with " coordination of care with other providers ... a comprehensive assessment and plan for optimum health ... and extra time " with patients . He was forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some healthcare analysts say patients should not have to pay extra for doctors ' attention . " It can rightly be argued that doctors should be giving us attention anyway , " says Becky Derby , a policy analyst at Health Care for All , an advocacy group in Boston . Health Care for All is backing a bill now under study in the Massachusetts legislature that would prevent concierge practices from treating patients who are members of health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) . <p> But Dr. Blanchard believes more and more doctors will find concierge practices attractive . Inflation-adjusted real income for primary-care doctors dropped 6.4 percent between 1995 and 1999 , according to the Center for Studying Health Care Change in Washington , and the alternatives are either to charge more or see more patients . <p> " The doctors out there are n't trying to line their pockets , I can tell you that , " Blanchard says . " We went into medicine because of the physician-patient relationship we build with patients . Frankly , I think many physicians have had it with overburdened practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , concierge doctors are more likely to have the time and income to take on nonpaying patients . His own concierge group spends one-third of its time on pro bono work , he says . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
