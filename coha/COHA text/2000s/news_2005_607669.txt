<p> During the stretch drive , New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick never wants to be asked about his team 's playoff possibilities  --  and that goes for his players , too . <p> " That 's not the reason we won three Super Bowls , " said Redskins wide receiver David Patten , who played for Belichick on all those Patriots championship teams . " But he never talked about anything except what was happening that week . He always would say , ' If you 're looking at the playoffs , you wo n't get to the playoffs . ' He said , ' Only the present matters . ' That was his whole mantra . " <p> In Washington a year later , Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs and many of his players are taking a different tack . With a 5-3 record at the halfway point and the Redskins tied with Dallas for second place , a game behind the New York Giants in the NFC East , few of them have any qualms about talking about the excitement of still being in the hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's excitement for us , for our team , for our fans , " Gibbs said last week . " I know it 's a lift to the coaching staff . . . . NFC battles are raging all over the place , and it 'll be week to week . It 's a much better position to be in , feeling like you 're fighting for it rather than having to come off the floor . " <p> Quarterback Mark Brunell said the playoffs are definitely " in the back of everyone 's mind . At 5-3 , at least you 're in the running . It 's not something you think about or predict , but it 's something that needs to be on the minds of everyone . Tampa Bay is 5-3 , and our mentality has to be whether we 're going against a 5-3 or a 1-7 team , on any week a team can come in and hit you right in the mouth . " <p> Added tackle Jon Jansen , " You 've got to think about the playoffs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . " <p> The Redskins at this point are very much a contender , either for the division title or a wild-card berth . They seem to have put their dismal 36-0 loss to the Giants two weeks ago behind them and also know their final three games of the regular season , all against NFC East rivals ( two at home against Dallas and the Giants before the season finale at Philadelphia on Jan. 1 ) likely will decide their postseason fate . <p> The schedule is definitely in their favor . The Bucs ' offense , led by inexperienced Chris Simms , has sputtered in two straight losses , and the Redskins know securing a second road victory today will be critical to their postseason hopes . They then have back-to-back home games , with four of their last seven at FedEx Field , where they 're 4-0 . They play St. Louis ( 4-4 ) and woeful Arizona ( 2-6 ) on the road . <p> But six of their last eight games also will be played against teams still very much in the playoff mix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be enough to get a wild-card spot , another 5-3 mark in the second half seems almost mandatory . <p> Unless they were to win the division , the Redskins ' chances are intertwined with the fortunes of others . Serious contenders in the NFC include the entire NFC East , though 4-4 Philadelphia 's chances of getting back in the race without suspended wide receiver Terrell Owens seem diminished . The Eagles will know far more about their playoff possibilities in the next two weeks  --  they entertain Dallas tomorrow night and travel to the Meadowlands the following week to take on the Giants . After that , four of their last six games will be at home , but it may be too late , especially with games against contending teams such as Seattle , the Giants , Rams and Redskins . <p> The Giants , riding a three-game winning streak , face a far more difficult second half . Their opponents in the first eight weeks were a combined 31-35 . Their foes in the second half are 35-29 and four of their last six games will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland . <p> After Minnesota at home today , they 'll also have what could be a season-defining four-game stretch against the visiting Eagles , on the road in Seattle , at home against the Cowboys and on the road at Philadelphia . If the Redskins and Giants stay close , their Christmas eve game at FedEx Field might mean in or out for either team . <p> " You 're constantly creating exciting scenarios for yourself in your mind as you go forward , " Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said last week . " You learn all you can from the game before and you 're certainly excited for the franchise , our players , our coaches and our team for the situation we 're in . But we have a long , long way to go . I think everyone knows that . The players know that . " <p> The Cowboys have a brutal three-game stretch over 11 days . They 'll play Detroit at Texas Stadium next week , then host Denver on Thanksgiving day . After that , it gets even tougher , with three road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team that is now .500 or better . <p> " I do n't think anyone else in the league has to do this , " Dallas Coach Bill Parcells said of the three games over the next 11 days . " It 's an arduous task and we 're going to be hard-pressed to get through it . I told the players they have to be ready to make a big push because you are n't going to have much time to think about it . I 've also tried to get the coaching staff ready . We 've done some work on these three teams already and we 'll try to do some work on Detroit while we 're in Philadelphia Monday . " <p> Outside the NFC East , Carolina , already on a five-game winning streak , may have the easiest time of it . Its next three games , all against nondivision opponents , also come against teams with shaky quarterback situations  --  at home against the Jets and games at Chicago and Buffalo . Three of the Panthers ' final five games are at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . They 'll face the Falcons again Jan. 1 in the regular season finale in a game that could decide the division title , though both teams likely will be in the postseason . <p> " Under no uncertain terms have we arrived , " said Carolina Coach John Fox . " We do n't want to get too far ahead or too far behind . We just want to stay in the now . " <p> The Falcons ' next two home games should not be too burdensome with Green Bay and Tampa Bay coming to town . But the Falcons also play four of their last six on the road , including a Thanksgiving game in Detroit . Four of the Falcons ' six wins have been by single-digit figures and both losses were by three points to Seattle and New England , both likely playoff teams . <p> " I like the fact that we 've been in close games because there are going to be more of those down the road , " said Falcons Coach Jim Mora . " We know how to win them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to learn how to win and how to recover from losses , and I think we 've done that . " <p> The Seahawks would have the NFC 's best record at 7-1 if not for a missed 47-yard field goal by Josh Brown at the end of regulation Oct. 2 , allowing the Redskins to win the game in overtime . At 6-2 , they 've got a two-game lead in the NFC West over the second-place Rams and could strike a killer blow to the Rams ' division title hopes this afternoon in Seattle , where they 're 4-0 . The Seahawks play three of their last five on the road , but four of their final eight games come against dead-enders San Francisco ( twice ) , Tennessee and Green Bay . <p> " It 's a huge football game , " Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said last week of today 's game against the Rams . " Since we 've been here 1999 , this is as big as any game we 'll play . " <p> The surprise team has been Chicago . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after today 's game against San Francisco , three of their next five games are at home . They 've also got to face Carolina , Pittsburgh and Atlanta over that stretch . They also have two holiday specials  --  a Christmas day game at Green Bay and a New Year 's Day game at Minnesota  --  definitely a good sign for the team 's first postseason appearance since 2001.
