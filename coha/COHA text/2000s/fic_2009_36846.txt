One <p> DUN ARD <p> SCOTLAND <p> DECEMBER 1295 <p> The clipped fall of boots on stone sounded loud in the deserted hallways of Dun Ard . Though few would be up and about at this early hour , Caden MacAlister had no doubt his cousin would already be hunkered over the estate accounts in his solar as he was each and every morning . Blane MacKiernan , Laird of the MacKiernan , taught the importance of hard work by setting an example . <p> Caden paused at the heavy wooden door , unconsciously running a large hand through his tousled dark copper hair as he gathered his wits and his courage . He had considered his alternatives time and again . This must be done . <p> He rapped his knuckles sharply against the door , the vibrations echoing in his stomach . Or was that simply nerves ? <p> " Enter . " <p> He pushed open the door and approached his cousin 's desk . " I 've come to a decision and I must speak with you . " Quickly . Before he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread in front of him , a smile creasing his face . " Very well , Caden . Have a seat and share yer great decision with me . " <p> Caden shook his head , declining the offer to sit . He thought better on his feet . " You must choose one of my brothers as your heir . I 'm no longer fit to be the next laird of the MacKiernan . " There . He 'd said it . It was done . <p> His cousin leaned back in his chair , studying the hands he steepled together . At last he looked up , a confused frown replacing his earlier smile . " I had thought you cared for our people and this land . " <p> " I do . And that 's why I ask you to choose another as yer heir . " Even though this was all he had ever really wanted . <p> " Explain yerself . " <p> " The next laird should be someone who 'll love this place , these people . Someone who 'll look after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to his own son to do the same . " And he would never be able to do that . <p> Blane nodded . " Exactly what I 've chosen you to do , lad . " <p> " I canna , Cousin . After what 's happened with Alycie , I ken now I 'll no ever wed . There will be no sons to succeed me . " <p> He would never have a wife . Alycie had found the idea of marriage to him so repulsive she had betrayed his sister and cousin in order to escape him , almost causing their deaths . He would never again put his family in such jeopardy . Nor would he trust another woman . Alycie was now happily installed in the convent on Iona as she had wanted , and he would remain unmarried as the fates had obviously intended . <p> " Yer young yet , Caden . Mayhap one day you 'll change yer mind on this . " <p> " No . I 'll no allow any other lass to be forced to face marriage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you made yers all those years ago . " <p> Blane rose from his chair , coming around his desk to place a hand on his young cousin 's shoulder . " I chose never to wed because I feared any son of mine would carry the madness of my father and my brother . I would no risk exposing Dun Ard and her people to that tragedy again . Yer situation is entirely different . You take too much blame upon yerself , lad . " <p> Caden shook his head . He deserved the blame . He knew his limitations . Of the three MacAlister brothers , he saw himself as the least desirable to a woman . He had neither Andrew 's pretty face nor Colin 's warrior abilities . He wanted only to manage Dun Ard . To find new ways to help their land and their people prosper . And while one day he would have been the laird of the MacKiernan , that alone was n't enough to hold a wife . He 'd learned that from his experience with Alycie . <p> No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mate in life . And though he had never known why his cousin remained unwed and childless , he suspected that Blane revealed his reason now in an attempt to provide solace . Solace he did n't deserve . " Still , I dinna think . . . " <p> " There 's no a need to think on this , lad . I willna choose any to be my heir other than you . I 've invested too many years in you and you 've learned too well the duties of a laird . You 'll go off to school as we 'd planned , and when you return you 'll pick up where you left off . You are my heir and that 's my last word on the subject . " <p> " And when I never wed ? When I have no sons to continue the line ? " <p> Blane smiled again , squeezing Caden 's shoulder before he dropped his hand and walked back to his chair . " If that is the way of it , then you 'll do as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' brats will succeed you , aye ? Now off with you . I 've work to do before I take my morning meal . " <p> Caden waited , unsure of what to do next . He 'd struggled for weeks trying to make the right decision . And now that he finally had , Blane had dismissed his concerns as minor . <p> " Go on , " Blane encouraged . " Oh , we 're still going out to inspect the sheep pens later this morning , are we no ? " <p> " If that 's yer wish , " Caden replied , leaving the room and shutting the door behind him . <p> He was almost embarrassed at the relief he felt , knowing at least part of his life would continue as he 'd always hoped . He would have Dun Ard to live for . <p> And as for his own heir ? <p> Just as Blane had said , Drew and Colin would marry and have sons . He would simply have to wait and watch to see what time would bring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
