<p> TALLAHASSEE , Fla. - Vice President Al Gore 's pursuit of a winning count in Florida on Friday drew threats of retaliation from Republicans , warnings from leery Democrats and a ruling from state election officials that the disputed Palm Beach County ballot was legal . <p> Gore and Texas Gov . George W. Bush made brief forays before the television cameras , but turned over the heavy-hitting to surrogates in Florida . Bush adviser James A. Baker III and Gore campaign chairman William Daley traded sharp words mixed with pleas for " the good of the country " at the state Capitol here . <p> Baker and Daley made it clear that neither side is prepared to concede an inch . <p> In his first public statement since Wednesday , Bush said Friday that he and his aides are planning for " a potential administration " despite the continuing vote count in Florida . <p> " This administration will be ready to assume office and be prepared to lead , " Bush told reporters at the Governor 's Mansion in Austin . He stopped short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should concede the election . <p> The candidates ' battle for 270 electoral votes was left hanging after Tuesday 's election , when Florida 's vote was so close it triggered an automatic statewide recount . <p> With Florida 's 25 electoral votes off the table , Bush won 29 states for 246 electoral votes . Gore added Oregon to his victory column Friday , and now holds 19 states plus the District of Columbia for 262 . <p> Gore 's lead in New Mexico was down to about 100 Friday night , and the race was too close to call . <p> There were also questions brewing about election results in Iowa and Wisconsin . Baker , a former secretary of state , warned Friday that Gore is inviting retaliatory recounts by the GOP in those states if Democrats pursue " endless challenges " to the vote in Florida . <p> Members of the Bush team will not " sit on our hands " if made to respond to recount after recount in Florida , Baker said . <p> While Baker played point man in the Florida dispute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he met in Austin with economic and international policy advisers . His talk of building a potential transition team with the results of the election still pending has infuriated Democratic officials . <p> Gore made his own nod to public relations Friday on the lawn of his Washington , D.C. , home , allowing himself to be photographed playing a game of touch football with family members . <p> In Florida , Baker attacked the Gore campaign 's request for hand counts in Palm Beach County , where 19,000 ballots were disqualified because voters punched two choices for president . Palm Beach election officials agreed to recount ballots in three precincts by hand today . At the same time , officials also will perform a mechanical recount of all ballots , a recount requested by Republicans . <p> " The presidency of the United States should not be determined by technicalities , " Gore chairman Daley said . <p> The Democrats are also pursuing hand counts in Volusia , Miami-Dade and Broward Counties - a strategy Baker called a delaying tactic . <p> " I 'd like to make it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there 's no reason to want to slow it down , " said former U.S. Secretary of State William Christopher , a Gore adviser . <p> " Governor Bush 's team . . . they 've got to make their own decisions , but we 're going to proceed here in a very careful and lawful way to try to ensure the will of the people of Florida has n't been upset . " <p> Christopher added that since the founding fathers provided for a period of time between the election and formal transfer of power , he does n't see a delay of only days past the Nov. 7 election as a constitutional crisis . <p> Democrats defended their calls for hand counts as one way of gleaning votes a computer can miss - such as a hole that is not sufficiently punched to register a candidate 's name . Baker countered that the more the ballots are handled , the greater the opportunity for human error . <p> " We 're asking that human beings look at these ballots , " Gore national spokesman Doug Hattaway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand counts , he said . <p> " For the good of the country and for the sake of our standing in the world , the campaigning should end and the business of an orderly transition should begin , " Baker said . <p> On Thursday , Daley said the Democratic Party would pursue its own litigation challenging the Palm Beach County ballot as too confusing . But even some Democrats have warned warned against a protracted legal battle . <p> " There might come a time when the vice president would be well served to say the country 's interest is more important than the interests of one person or political party , and go ahead and concede . That would be reassuring to the nation and to the world , " said Sen. Dale Bumpers , D-Ark . <p> " It would put him in an unbelievably advantageous position for the Democratic nomination in 2004 . " <p> Said Sen. Robert Torricelli , D-N.J. : " I want Al Gore to win this election but , more than that , I want somebody to win this election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the country and avoid any collateral attacks on the process . " <p> On Friday , Gore spokesman Hattaway appeared to take a step back , saying Democrats would " likely be supporting ( existing ) legal action by citizens . " <p> Several lawsuits are already pending in Palm Beach County , filed by citizens who claim the confusing ballot prevented them from voting for the candidate of their choice . <p> The lawsuits will likely be resolved on more arcane findings of law , but the Florida Secretary of State 's office issued a statement Friday saying the design and layout of the Palm Beach ballot " does conform to the laws of the state of Florida . " <p> The Palm Beach vote is perceived as the " make-or-break " point for Gore in Florida . <p> An unofficial tally by The Associated Press in Florida 's 67 counties showed the Texas governor with a 327-vote lead . <p> So even if the majority of overseas ballots are marked for Bush , Democrats say the Palm Beach vote could win the day for Gore if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were double-punched were intended for Gore . It 's a claim Bush adviser Baker dismisses outright : <p> " If we have ballots with two votes , of course we ca n't count them , and of course we ca n't guess about them , " Baker said . " No jurisdiction in America would accept such a ballot as a valid vote . " <p> Democrats also claim that the approximately 3,400 votes cast for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan in Palm Beach County - three times as many votes as Buchanan received in any other Florida county - are strong evidence that the ballot confused voters into marking the wrong choices . <p> <p> What 's ahead <p> A look at the dates and deadlines facing George W.
