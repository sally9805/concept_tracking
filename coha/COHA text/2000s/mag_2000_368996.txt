If you own a manufacturing business , you might want to pay a visit to West Lebanon , N.H. Odds are you 've never been to West Lebanon . You may not even have heard of it . But you will . What 's going on there may forever change the way you do business  --  or perhaps put you out of it altogether . <P> Tucked away in an unremarkable industrial building on the outskirts of town is a little machine about the size of a three-drawer filing cabinet . There 's a curious Willy Wonka look to it . Feed a bit of metal powder into its maw , and after a moment of whirring and digesting , it spits out , say , a valve for a diesel engine or a gear for a car transmission or a pump component for a hot tub . It 's an odd bit of industrial alchemy to watch  --  mere dust transforming itself into highly refined hardware . <P> The little machine in West Lebanon is known as a powder metallurgy press , and to most manufacturers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powder presses have been around for 70 years , stamping out everything from truck-motor parts to medical equipment . Remarkably common though they are , these machines are remarkably crude . Most powder presses are great , loud , chugging things , about the size and shape of a tractor trailer and demanding the ministrations of at least 200 people to keep them running through a workweek . Retooling the presses to switch from making one component to another can take days . And any parts the machines do produce are coarse things at best , requiring up to a dozen refinements and improvements before they 're ready for use . <P> The West Lebanon machine , developed by Mii Technologies LLC , is a whole different industrial beast . It 's part of a new manufacturing system that is fast , portable and computerized . It can be shipped wherever it 's needed and easily reconfigured to make just about any part for just about any manufacturer . <P> A machine this elegant ought to have come from the R.-and-D. wing of a Honeywell or a John Deere or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team of local inventors who might be among the most important industrial visionaries since Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak first took to their workbenches . While the machine the West Lebanon inventors are giving the world is not quite the personal computer , it could become to 21st century manufacturers what the cotton gin was to the farmer or the loom to the miller . " If these guys have the materials and can automate the manufacturing process , " says Kevin Prouty , an industry analyst with AMR Research in Boston , " that 's moving toward a new level  --  toward a manufacturing renaissance . " <P> By any measure , a renaissance in manufacturing is long overdue . Traditional powder presses are not the only low-tech way parts have been built over the years ; stamping machines , casting machines and forging machines are used to melt or muscle metal into shape . Not only are these machines imprecise , they are also fantastically expensive and hard to come by . A start-up company that wants to manufacture parts for a new product may have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not exactly the quick turnaround time we 've come to expect in the age of silicon .
