To the Cherokee these hills were shaconage-blue , the color of smoke . To more than nine million visitors a year , Great Smoky Mountains National Park offers sanctuary for the soul . // Surely these are , if nothing else , the most perfectly named mountains in the world . " Great Smoky Mountains " : The words conjure fog drifting off a breathing canopy of trees , mist rising above a waterfall , the soft warmth of southern air . Perhaps , as well , the tang of barbecue chased down with moonshine whiskey . But whoever may have coined that poetic phrase , his identity , or hers , is lost to history . Some say it harks back to the Cherokee word for blue-shaconage-for these ancient summits seem cloaked in the wood-smoke of a thousand vanished council fires . When its boosters brag about the qualities of Great Smoky Mountains National Park , they mention both its wildness ( " the last great virgin forest in the East " ) and its proximity to civilization ( " within a day 's drive of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems an impossible paradox , especially as you inch your way through Gatlinburg on Highway 441 toward the park 's busiest entrance , past an unbroken wall of motels , waffle houses , and T-shirt shops on either side . How could an area like this possibly contain some of the most verdant habitats and sublime mountain vistas in eastern North America ? Yet once inside the park itself-through which Highway 441 continues , but now as a kind of tunnel through lush foliage-it is clear that you have entered a different world . The park 's 814 square miles , stretching in an oblong mass across the Tennessee-North Carolina border , put it nearly on a scale with great western parks like Yosemite . But visitors who come in search of Ansel Adams landscapes may be disappointed . They will find no glaciers here , no geysers , no heart-stopping canyons . There are , wrote one early traveler , Horace Kephart , " no ribs and vertebrae of the earth exposed . Seldom does one see even a naked ledge of rock . " Instead , these ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green . The vast wealth of the Smokies is in the region 's profusion of animal and plant life-riches that have only recently begun to be fully appreciated . Since 1997 , a coalition of scientists , naturalists , and citizen volunteers has undertaken a treasure hunt to identify and catalog every single species found in the park . The survey is the most ambitious and sustained effort of its kind ever conducted in North America . So far the tally stands at 14,000 and counting-among them some 600 living organisms previously unknown to science , many of which probably exist nowhere else . Most of these are not what one would call " charismatic " species : They include snails , beetles , moths , and new types of algae . Still , scientists say the findings indicate a level of biodiversity rivaled by few other places on the planet outside the great tropical rain forests . And they believe that the Smokies ' ultimate species total may reach ten times the current count . A conspiracy of factors made these mountains a near-perfect hothouse of biodiversity , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The north-south orientation of the Appalachian chain helped : During the last ice age , many species took refuge from the glaciers here , fleeing southward along protected valleys . The Smokies also have a diverse underlying geology , and a heavy annual rainfall fueled by tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico . Most important , dramatic changes in elevation mean that this relatively small region encompasses a stunning variety of ecosystems . " When you hike from the lowlands to the upcountry here , it 's like hiking from Georgia to Maine , " Langdon said . In fact , for anyone who grew up somewhere in that long stretch of the United States , walking in these woods is like experiencing familiar landscapes that have been somehow enriched , enlivened , concentrated . Meadows hum with bees , groves of hemlocks echo with the knock of woodpeckers , barred rays of sunlight shift and dance above the surface of a trout stream : It is as if a thousand well-loved meadows , a thousand groves , a thousand streams , had all been distilled into this mythic forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Smokies are-or once were -a kind of cultural biosphere reserve , as well as an ecological one . One local person who is well aware of that is Mike Maples , whose European-American forebears began settling here in the late 1700s . " There 's not a place in the park where I 'm not rich in cousins , " he boasted . Maples , an avid amateur historian , spoke in the present tense , but the truth is that all those kinfolk have been gone for decades , dispersed when the national park was created in the 1930s . Unlike most of the western parks , which were carved out of vast holdings of federal land , Great Smoky Mountains National Park was stitched together from thousands of small tracts , including farms and villages that had existed for a century or more . This part of Appalachia was the ancestral home of the Cherokee and one of the first frontiers of the fledgling United States , where the restless energies of the young nation spilled over into a green new land . Tough Scotch-Irish veterans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the chain of mountains . They and their descendants built communities in which old ways died hard , family feuds died even harder , and moonshining was a way of life . ( Without decent roads , turning your corn crop into liquor was the only way to get it handily to market . ) Although the Park Service has preserved scores of scattered buildings , not much is left of many settlements but some gnarled fence posts in the woods , a few tumbled chimney stacks , and perhaps a small cemetery on a muddy hillside . There also remains a lingering resentment of the park among some local families who were forced to give up hard-won lands and livelihoods . I met one of the last of the dispossessed , 96-year-old Gudger Palmer , at a reunion of families that once lived in the park 's Cataloochee Valley . Palmer 's greatgrandfather , in the 1830s , cleared with his own hands fields that have now been made wilderness again . " I used to mow hay right here , with a horsedrawn mowing machine , " Palmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the park several years ago , now roam . " There were about a thousand people in this valley , including children . It feels like home still . People did n't want to go , but we knew we had to . " Maples shares the sentiment but has also come to terms with the past . " My grandmother hated the park till her last day on Earth . But if it were n't for the park , what would all this be now ? Nothing but condos and hotels , probably . " THE SMOKIES ARE , by some measures , the most visited national park in the country , yet the great majority of visitors never set foot on an unpaved surface . They may stop by the park visitors center or drive the scenic loop at Cades Cove-a grassy valley where cars crawl bumper to bumper as people lean out of windows to photograph deer-but they never glimpse the backcountry trails , just a few miles away , where even on a summer weekend you can hike all day and encounter scarcely another living soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air pollution of any national park in the country , thanks not just to those cars but also to coal-burning power plants and factories throughout the eastern United States . When you hike a ridgeline on an overcast day , you may be inhaling rain clouds that have the approximate acidity of vinegar and ozone pollution that rivals nearby cities . Not surprisingly , many trees along those ridges are dead or dying , although the dirty air serves only to weaken them . The actual killers are exotic insects and other plagues . An invasive blight in the 1930s all but erased the mighty American chestnut . More recent invaders threaten the park 's hemlocks , dogwoods , butternuts , beeches , spruces , and firs . " What will the forests look like 20 years from now ? Probably very different , " said backcountry manager George Minnigh . Crisis and change are not new to these woods . One weekend I hiked up Hazel Creek , the still-remote area where Horace Kephart camped a century ago . A writer and ethnographer , Kephart came to these mountains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities where he found the 18th century still living undisturbed in the 20th . " All about us was the forest primeval , " he wrote in his most famous book , Our Southern Highlanders , a vivid anecdotal account of life among moonshiners and mountain folk . " Our settlement was a mere slash in the vast woodland that encompassed it . " Years later Kephart returned to the area to find it altered beyond recognition . " Industrial logging had come to Hazel Creek . They 'd just raped it , " said my hiking companion Kenneth Wise , a librarian and Kephart aficionado . After the big lumber companies ramped up logging in the Smokies in the early 1900s , about 80 percent of the forest was clear-cut and turned into clapboard houses , newsprint , and World War I biplane struts . Fighting to save what was left , Kephart became one of the earliest and most eloquent advocates for a national park in the Smokies . Today , robust second-growth forest covers the hillsides along Hazel Creek . Even that " mere slash " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INCLUDING THE MOST CASUAL VISITORS to the park-the ones just passing through on Highway 441 on their way to someplace else-stops to take a picture at Newfound Gap . It is the notch where the road crosses the ridgeline between North Carolina and Tennessee , and from the highest point there is a panoramic view of green peaks stretching row on row into the farthest distance . In the parking lot one summer afternoon , roadtripping parents and kids mingled with Chinese-speaking tourists and grizzled Appalachian Trail through-hikers . Newfound Gap is also the spot where , on September 2 , 1940 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a speech dedicating Great Smoky Mountains National Park . " FOR THE PERMANENT ENJOYMENT OF THE PEOPLE , " reads a plaque on the stone observation tower beneath which the President spoke . Those people included thousands of schoolchildren who donated pennies to help purchase the family farms of Gudger Palmer and others . As I stood looking at the plaque and the green expanse beyond , it occurred to me that even more than other national parks , Great Smoky is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The wilderness below me was , in a very real sense , man-made . And perhaps , in a crowded world , a place like this can offer hopeful clues to how we can continue coexisting with nature-or early warning signs of what we stand to lose .
