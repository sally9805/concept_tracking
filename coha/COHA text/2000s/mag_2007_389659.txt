You 've got the high-def tv . Here are two camcorders that will show it off . " VE BEEN PRODUCING and directing a television pilot for ABC called Pushing Daisies . It 's about a guy who discovers at the age of eight that he has the ability to bring dead things back to life , but only for a minute . If he lets them live beyond that , they 're alive for good , and someone else has to die . I do n't know if it will actually be on the air next fall , but working on it has been a lot of fun , and despite being stuck in Los Angeles ( where the weather is profoundly overrated ) and missing Sweetie ( the wife ) , I 've been surprisingly happy . I thought I would document the making of this wacky show with a couple of the new high-definition video cameras that record directly to SD cards . By recording to SD ( the kind of memory cards in most digital still cameras ) , you avoid the heartbreak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera or playback machine . Plus , SD cards are incredibly small , drain less battery , and can be transferred to your computer for editing much faster than the real-time rate of videotapes . The footage can then be edited and burned to a DVD , or you can hook up your camera to your high-def TV for manly playback . Of course , as the late Milton Friedman often said , " There 's no such thing as a free lunch , " and that is surely the case with the video cameras I tested . ( If only Milt had met the lead of our show , he 'd still be alive , although someone else would have had to die  --  a lesser economist , I presume . ) The Canon PowerShot TX1 ( powershot.com ) is incredibly small , lists for only $500 , and also shoots 7.1-megapixel still images . It is well built and , for me , worked more as a slightly clunky still camera with high-def movie-recording capabilities . It is nicely pocketable and a good little camera to take hiking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found the video a bit grainy and the autofocus quite slow . Like the Canon , the $1,300 Panasonic HDC-SD1 ( panasonic.com ) also uses up to a four-gigabyte SD card to record about an hour or so of high-definition ( 720p ) footage . The Leica lens produces sharp , contrasty , great-looking images . I have a hilarious ( or maybe you had to be there ) endless take of me discussing the nature of comedy with Ellen Greene ( of Little Shop of Horrors fame ) , explaining how , for me , comedy is always funnier when spoken faster and flatter . The images are shockingly vivid and colorful . On the other hand , it takes only two-megapixel still photos , is weirdly shaped , and is too bulky to put in your pocket . But the quality is so good that you ca n't help but want to schlepp it around . What would Milton Friedman do ? He 'd buy the Panasonic . Because at the end of the day , why bother to record the scene at all unless it is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the director of Get Shorty , Men in Black , and RV . The Useful Part HOW TO PICK A LENS LIKE A PRO The right lens will give a subtle but distinct point of view to your home movies . The wide-angle end of your zoom is for comedy . Wider-angle lenses have an intrinsic energy about them . As someone leans forward or back in his chair , for instance , he can go from a medium shot to an extreme close-up in a matter of a foot . Shoot from a low angle with a wide-angle lens and you get funny plus heroic . The telephoto end of your camera is handsome and romantic . It throws the background out of focus , bringing attention to the person instead of the environment . It flattens people 's faces ( and noses ) and makes them look more beautiful . Shoot from above the person 's face to flatter even more . Since I see the world as more of a comical place than a beautiful one ( with the exception of the wife and kid ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoom trigger completely . If you want to be closer on something , move yourself . Get closer , do n't zoom closer . Moving the camera brings an energy and intimacy to your film that you 'll never get by zooming.  --  B.
