You ca n't see his blue eyes . Not even from the close-up seats they give to theater critics , much less a vantage point farther back in the house , where most folks have to sit . In fact , fans of Paul Newman the movie star may find little they recognize in his first appearance on Broadway in 38 years ( and even longer , if you forget about 1964 's Baby Want a Kiss , which most people have ) . <P> Like many other actors who have become Hollywood icons , Newman thinks he would have led a worthier life if he had done more theater . So he chose to make his return to the stage ( in a production first seen at the Westport Country Playhouse , where his wife Joanne Woodward is artistic director ) in Our Town , Thornton Wilder 's oft produced slice of Americana , which is given some 350 stagings around the country each year . As the Stage Manager  --  the fourth-wall-bursting narrator who introduces us to the town of Grover 's Corners and its bashful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the front of the stage for much of the show but in the shadows for most of the drama . He has no showy emotional moments , his thin voice struggles to fill the house , and there 's no camera to help us fathom the depths of his twinkling eyes and brooding face . <P> Still , Newman , 77 , projects a relaxed authority that downplays the drama 's sentimentality and stiffens its philosophical spine . His now wispy body and white hair make him more grandfatherly than ever . But he comes across less as a sage or authorial god than as a matter-of-fact neighbor who just happens to have stuck around long enough to tell the story . It 's in keeping with Wilder 's paean to those mundane details of life that we take for granted  --  and that pass away all too fleetingly . " You know how it is , " Newman says , leaping at the line as he does for no other in the play , " you 're 21 or 22 , and you make some decisions ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lived it , and we 've lived it with him . <P> There 's something else important that Newman brings to Our Town : modesty . He lets other actors take the limelight , especially Frank Converse and Jeffrey DeMunn , as the fathers of the young lovers ; Stephen Spinella , who writes his own play in a couple of vivid scenes as the drunken choirmaster ; and Maggie Lacey , who makes a fetching Broadway debut as Emily . Aside from adding some understated sound effects  --  a newspaper plopping on the porch , the bell when a soda fountain 's front door opens and shuts  --  director James Naughton leaves the play alone . And left alone , it is as moving as ever . <P> Just listen to the audience in those last 20 minutes as the dead , arrayed in simple chairs in the town cemetery , talk of the ineffable sadness of the living  --  " how troubled and ... how in the dark live persons are , " as one puts it . It 's a sound that has become increasingly rare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seats . It 's a sure sign that the play has done its chief job : it has got the audience 's attention . By this point , we have all but forgotten that Our Town is the vehicle for a big star 's comeback on Broadway . And that may be Paul Newman 's finest moment .  --  By Richard Zoglin
