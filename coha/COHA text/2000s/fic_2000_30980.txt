Chapter 1 : The Twist There are these three eighth-grade boys . They 've just gotten out of school for the day . And they 're about to take off in different directions , when they notice something going on in the trash Dumpster at the other end of the parking lot . They 're still pretty far away from it , but they can see an old man sitting on the edge of the thing . His back is facing them , and he 's just sort of balancing himself there . Staring down into the bottom of the Dumpster . The boys watch him for a second . And then one of them starts grinning . And he cups his hands around his mouth and shouts out , " Hey ! Do n't jump , Pops ! You 've got everything to live for ! " Then one of the other boys yells , " Yeah ! Plus I heard the food is much better at the Dumpster up the street ! " So after that , both kids totally crack up . And it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holler out the funniest insults at the old guy . Like the first kid asks the old man if he went to P.U . University . And then the second kid asks if he has any Grey Poupon . But the third kid , see , he 's just standing there not saying a word . Instead , his eyes are glued to the old guy , almost . Like he 's waiting for a reaction . Only that 's the thing . Because there is no reaction . Not at first , anyway . At first , the old man never even turns around . So the boys begin to think that maybe the guy 's deaf or something . Which totally takes the fun out of shouting insults . But then  --  out of the blue  --  something seems to click in the old man 's brain . I mean , even from the back you can see his head sort of perk up . It 's like he gets it now , you know ? He suddenly understands that all this yelling has been directed at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then he turns around to see who 's been talking to him . And that 's pretty much that . The fun is over . Because even from the other end of the parking lot , it 's obvious to the boys that there 's something really wrong with the old guy . That he 's just not right in the head . Instead of acting mad or angry or even insulted , his face actually brightens . And he waves as friendly as anything , and shouts , " Hullo , fellas ! " And it 's so pathetic , I ca n't even tell you . The two boys shut up after that . I mean , they chuckle a little bit and all . But you can tell they 're not exactly busting with pride over making fun of a retarded old man . But see , the third kid  --  the one who kept quiet  --  he does n't have anything to be ashamed about at all . Because like I said , he did n't do anything . So if you happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'd probably think that the third kid was the good kid . That he was the one with a conscience or some sense of decency or something . Only that 's the weird thing about this story . That 's the twist , I guess you 'd call it . On account of the third kid turned out to be the most shameful of all . Because the third kid was me . And the old man in the Dumpster was my grandfather .
