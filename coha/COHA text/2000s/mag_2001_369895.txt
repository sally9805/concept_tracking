The seven-year-old Atlanta boy will probably forget one day what he did to earn the Rev. Arthur Allen Jr . ' s ire . But the memory of the punishment that followed will surely live on . Police say three of Allen 's flock , heeding the pastor 's teaching , held the boy down in the House of Prayer church while a fourth whipped him with a switch . On Feb. 28 , when the boy told a teacher he was in pain , she found welts on his body . <P> After interviewing that boy and a 10-year-old who also bore signs of lashing , Georgia officials removed them and 39 other kids from their homes in three separate raids in March . Officials with the Fulton County department of family and children services say they had offered the parents , all House of Prayer members , an alternative : they could agree to refrain from corporal punishment for two days during an investigation into the children 's safety . All the parents refused . TV reporters captured harrowing images of crying children being dragged away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on charges that they participated in or encouraged the beating of the two kids . <P> The pastor and some of those followers have been convicted before of similar charges . Even now , out on bail and awaiting trial , Allen , 68 , vows to keep encouraging corporal punishment , which he believes Scripture condones . His nondenominational church is located in a mostly African-American neighborhood of northwest Atlanta , where the churches outnumber the stoplights . " We ca n't sway from the Bible because we 're in trouble with the state , " Allen told TIME on Friday , his followers standing around him intoning " Mmm-hmm . " He says the country 's notorious school shootings prove the need for discipline . And he points out that only two of the 41 kids were found to have visible injuries . <P> Research has consistently shown that the more often parents use corporal punishment , the more likely a child will be violent . But a majority of Americans still approve of corporal punishment . And 28% of parents hit their kids with objects like belts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straus . Corporal punishment is allowed in Georgia schools , and state law says it 's O.K. to inflict " transitory pain and potential bruising " if they are n't " excessive . " <P> Allen crossed the law 's nebulous line in 1992 . He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after a 16-year-old testified that two men held her down at the church while others beat her . The pastor himself testified that the beating lasted 20 to 30 minutes . The girl said he had " brainwashed " the congregation . Allen said she was being punished for sexual activity , a claim he made in the recent beatings too . <P> As in many clashes over corporal punishment , the public debate will come down to semantics : What does the Bible mean when it warns against " sparing the rod " ? Does the law permit bruises that last overnight or just those that fade by evening ? While the police measure the welts , the children sit in foster care . <P>  --  By Amanda Ripley .
