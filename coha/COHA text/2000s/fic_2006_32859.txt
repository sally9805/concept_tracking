January 12 , 1994 . Day 1 5:26 p.m. 22 Josh Kirkwood and his two best buddies burst out of the locker room , flying into the cold , dark late afternoon , hollering at the tops of their lungs . Their breath billowed out in rolling clouds of steam . They flung themselves off the steps like mountain goat kids leaping from ledge to ledge and landed hip-deep in the snow on the side of the hill . Hockey sticks skittered down , gear bags sliding after . Then came the Three Amigos , squealing and giggling , tucked into balls of wild-colored ski jackets and bright stocking caps . The Three Amigos . That was what Brian 's dad called them . Brian 's family had moved to Deer Lake , Minnesota , from Denver , Colorado , and his dad was still a big Broncos fan . He said the Broncos used to have some wide receivers called the Three Amigos and they were really good . Josh was a Vikings fan . As far as he was concerned , every other team was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cause their uniforms were cool . He did n't like the Broncos , but he liked the nickname -- the Three Amigos . " We are the Three Amigos ! " Matt yelled as they landed in a heap at the bottom of the hill . He threw back his head and howled like a wolf . Brian and Josh joined in , and the racket was so terrible it made Josh 's ears ring . Brian fell into a fit of uncontrollable giggles . Matt flopped onto his back and started making a snow angel , swinging his arms and legs in wide arcs , looking as if he were trying to swim back up the hill . Josh pushed himself to his feet and shook like a dog as Coach Olsen came out of the ice arena . Coach was old -- at least forty-five -- kind of fat and mostlybald , but he was a good coach . He yelled a lot , but he laughed a lot , too . He told them at the beginning of hockey season that if he got too cranky they were to remind him they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that job . He was one of the co-captains , a responsibility that pleased him a lot even though he would never say so . Nobody liked a bragger , Mom said . If you did your job well , there was n't any reason to brag . A good job would speak for itself . Coach Olsen started down the steps , tugging down the earflaps of his hunting cap . The end of his nose was red from the cold . His breath came out of his mouth and went up around his head like smoke from a chimney . " You guys have rides home tonight ? " They answered all at once , vying for the coach 's attention by being loud and silly . He laughed and held his gloved hands up in surrender . " All right , all right ! The rink 's open if you get cold waiting . Olie 's inside if you need to use the phone . " Then Coach jumped into his girlfriend 's car , the way he did every Wednesday , and off they went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma 's famous meat loaf night . All-U-Can-Eat , it said on the menu . Josh imagined Coach Olsen could eat a lot . Cars rumbled around the circular drive in front of the Gordie Knutson Memorial Arena , a parade of minivans and station wagons , doors banging , exhaust pipes coughing . Kids from the various Squirt League teams chucked their sticks and equipment in trunks and hatches and climbed into the cars with their moms or dads , talking a mile a minute about the plays and drills they had worked on in practice . Matt 's mom pulled up in their new Transport , a wedge-shaped thing that to Josh looked like something from Star Trek . Matt scrambled for his gear and dashed across the sidewalk , calling a good-bye over his shoulder . His mother , wearing a bright red stocking cap , buzzed down the passenger window . " Josh , Brian -- you guys have rides ? " " My mom 's coming , " Josh answered , suddenly feeling eager to see her . She would pick him up on her way home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pizza to get supper and she would want to hear all about practice . Really want to hear . Not like Dad . Lately , Dad just pretended to listen . Sometimes he even snapped at Josh to be quiet . He always apologized later , but it still made Josh feel bad . " My sister 's coming , " Brian called . " My sister , Beth Butt-head , " he added under his breath as Mrs. Connor drove away . " You 're the butt-head , " Josh teased , shoving him . Brian shoved back , laughing , three big gaps showing in his mouth where teeth had been . " Butt-head ! " " Butt-breath ! " " Butt-face ! " Brian scooped up a mitten full of snow and tossed it in Josh 's face , then turned and ran up the snow-packed sidewalk , bounded up the steps , and dashed around the side of the brick building . Josh let out a war whoop and bolted after him . Immediately they were so involved in their game of Attack , the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other to deliver a snowball up close in the face , in the back , down the neck of the jacket . After a successful attack the roles reversed and the hunter became the hunted . If the hunter could n't find the hunted in a count of a hundred , the hunted scored a point . Josh was good at hiding . He was small for his age and he was smart , a combination that served him well in games like Attack . He smashed Brian in the back of the head with a snowball , whirled and ran . Before Brian had shaken the snow off his coat , Josh was safely tucked behind the air-conditioning units that squatted beside the building . The cylinders were covered with canvas for the winter months and blocked the wind . They sat well back along the side of the building , where the streetlights did n't quite reach . Josh watched as Brian ventured cautiously around a Dumpster , snowball in hand , pouncing at a shadow , then drawing back . Josh smiled to himself . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip of a gloved forefinger and drew himself a point in the air . Brian homed in on one of the overgrown bushes that lined the edge of the parking lot and separated the ice rink grounds from the fairgrounds . Tongue sticking out the side of his mouth , he crept toward it . He hoped Josh had n't gone farther than the hedges . The fairgrounds was the creepiest place in the world this time of year , when all the old buildings stood dark and empty and the wind howled around them . A car horn blared and Brian swung around , heart pounding . He groaned in disappointment as his sister 's Rabbit pulled up around the curve . " Come on , hurry up , Brian ! I 've got pageant practice tonight ! " " But --  " " But nothing , twerp ! " Beth Hiatt snapped . The wind whipped a strand of long blond hair across her face and she snagged it back behind her ear with a bare hand white with cold . " Get your little butt in the car ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then trudged toward his gear bag and hockey stick . Beth the Bitch raced the Rabbit 's motor , put the car in gear , and let it lurch ahead on the drive , as if she might just leave him behind . She had done that once before and they had both gotten hollered at , but Brian had gotten the worst of it because Beth blamed him for getting her in trouble and spent four days tormenting him for it . Instantly forgetting his game and the remaining amigo , he grabbed his stuff and ran for the car , already plotting ways to get his sister back for being such a snot . Behind the air-conditioning units , Josh heard Beth Hiatt 's voice . He heard the car doors slam and he heard the Rabbit roar around the circle drive . So much for the game . He crawled out of his hiding spot and went back around the front of the building . The parking lot was empty except for Olie 's old rusted-out Chevy van . The next practice did n't start for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asphalt by countless tires , the snow gleamed in the glow of the streetlights , as hard and shiny as milky-white marble . Josh tugged off his left glove and shoved up the sleeve of his ski jacket to peer at the watch Uncle Tim had sent him for Christmas . Big and black with lots of dials and buttons , it looked like something a scuba diver might wear -- or a commando . Sometimes Josh pretended that he was a commando , a man on a mission , waiting to meet with the world 's most dangerous spy . The numbers on the watch face glowed green in the dark : 5:45 . Josh looked down the street , expecting to see headlights , expecting to see the minivan with his mom at the wheel . But the street was dark . The only lights glowed dimly out the windows of houses that lined the block . Inside those houses , people were having supper and watching the news and talking about their day . Outside , the only sound was the buzz of the street lamps and the cold wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sky was black . He was alone . 5:17 p.m. 22 She nearly escaped . She had her coat halfway on , purse slung over her shoulder , gloves and car keys clutched in one hand . She hurried down the hall toward the west side door of the hospital , staring straight ahead , telling herself if she did n't make eye contact , she would n't be caught , she would be invisible , she would escape . I sound like Josh . That 's the kind of game he likes -- what if we could make ourselves invisible ? A smile curved Hannah 's lips . Josh and his imagination . Last night she 'd found him in Lily 's room , telling his sister an adventure story about Zeek the Meek and Super Duper , characters Hannah had made up in stories for Josh when he was a toddler . He was passing on the tradition , telling the tale with great enthusiasm while Lily sat in her crib and sucked her thumb , her blue eyes wide with astonishment , hanging on her brother 's every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plus column . I 'll take what I can get these days . The smile faded and tension tightened in Hannah 's stomach . She blinked hard and realized she was just standing there at the end of the hall with her coat half on . Rand Bekker , head of maintenance , shouldered his way through the door , letting in a blast of crisp air . A burly man with a full red beard , he pulled off a flame-orange hunting cap and shook himself like a big wet ox , as if he could shake off the chill . " Hiya , Dr. Garrison . Decent night out there . " " Is it ? " She smiled automatically , blankly , as if she were speaking with a stranger . But there were no strangers at Deer Lake Community Hospital . Everyone knew everyone . " You bet . It 's looking good for Snowdaze . " Rand grinned , his anticipation for the festival as plain as a child 's eagerness for Christmas morning . Snowdaze was big doings in a town the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break the monotony of Minnesota 's long winter . Hannah tried to find some enthusiasm . She knew Josh was looking forward to Snowdaze , especially the torchlight parade . But it was difficult for her to feel festive these days . For the most part , she felt tired , drained , dispirited . And stretched over it all was a thin film of desperation , like plastic wrap , because she could n't let any of those feelings show . People depended on her , looked up to her , thought of her as a model for working women . Hannah Garrison : doctor , wife , mother , woman of the year ; juggling all the demanding roles with skill and ease and a beauty queen smile . Lately the titles had felt as heavy as bowling balls and her arms were growing weary . " Rough day ? " " What ? " She jerked her attention back to Rand . " I 'm sorry , Rand . Yeah , it 's been one of those days . " " I better let you go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hannah murmured good-bye as Bekker pulled open a door marked Maintenance Staff Only and disappeared through it , leaving her alone in the hall . Her inner voice , the voice of the little goblin that kept the cling wrap pulled tight over her emotions , gave a shout . Go ! Go now ! Escape while you can ! Get away ! She had to pick up Josh . They would stop and get a pizza , then go on to the sitter 's for Lily . After supper she had to drive Josh to religion class . . . . But her body refused to bolt in response . Then the great escape was lost . " Dr. Garrison to ER . Dr. Garrison to ER . " That selfish part of her prodded once more , telling her she could still get away . She was n't on call tonight , had no patients in the hundred-bed facility who were in critical need of her personal attention . There was no one here to see her escape . She could leave the work to the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set on earth to rush to the aid of mere mortals and comfort them with his cover-boy looks . Hannah was n't even the backup tonight . But guilt came directly on the heels of those thoughts . She had taken an oath to serve . It did n't matter that she 'd seen enough sore throats and bruised bodies to last her one day . She had a duty -- a bigger one now that the hospital board had named her director of the ER . The people of Deer Lake depended on her . The page sounded again . Hannah heaved a sigh and felt tears warm the backs of her eyes . She was exhausted -- physically , emotionally . She needed this night off , a night with just herself and the kids ; with Paul working late , keeping his moods and his sarcasm in his office instead of inflicting them on the family . A wavy strand of honey-blond hair escaped her loose ponytail and fell limply against her cheek . She sighed and brushed it back behind her ear as she stared out the door to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Garrison to ER . Dr. Garrison to ER . " She slipped her coat off and folded it over her arm . " God , there you are ! " Kathleen Casey blurted out as she skidded around the corner and hustled down the hall , the tails of her white lab coat sailing behind her . The thick , cushioned soles of her running shoes made almost no sound on the polished floor . Not a fraction of an inch over five feet , the nurse had a leprechaun 's features , a shock of thick red hair , and the tenacity of a pit bull . Her uniform consisted of surgical scrubs and a pin that proclaimed No Whining . She drew a bead on Hannah that had all the power of a tractor beam . Hannah tried to muster a wry smile . " Sorry . God may be a woman , but she 's not this woman . " Kathleen gave a snort as she curled a hand around Hannah 's upper arm . " You 'll do . " " Ca n't Craig handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a higher life form with opposable thumbs . " " I 'm not even on call tonight . I have to pick up Josh from hockey . Call Dr. Baskir --  "
