Chapter One Four Years Later In the years since Jim had died , Julie Barenson had somehow found a way to start living again . It had n't happened right away . The first couple of years after his death had been difficult and lonely , but time had eventually worked its magic on Julie , changing her loss into something softer . Though she loved Jim and knew that part of her would always love Jim , the pain was n't as sharp as it had once been . She could remember her tears and the total vacuum her life had become in the aftermath of his death , but the searing ache of those days was behind her . Now when she thought of Jim , she remembered him with a smile , thankful that he 'd been part of her life . She was thankful for Singer , too . Jim had done the right thing by getting her the dog . In a way , Singer had made it possible for her to go on . But at this moment , while lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , Julie was n't thinking about what a wonderful support Singer had been during the past four years . Instead , she was mentally cursing his very existence while gasping for breath , thinking , I ca n't believe that this is the way I 'm going to die . Squashed in bed by my very own dog . With Singer splayed across her , pinning her to the mattress , she imagined her lips turning blue from oxygen deprivation . " Get up , you lazy dog , " she wheezed . " You 're killing me here . " Snoring soundly , Singer did n't hear her , and Julie began squirming , trying to bounce him from his slumber . Suffocating beneath the weight , she felt as if she 'd been wrapped in a blanket and tossed in a lake , Mafia style . " I 'm serious , " she forced out , " I ca n't breathe . " Singer finally lifted his massive head and blinked at her groggily . What 's all the racket about ? he seemed to be asking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Get off ! " Julie rasped out . Singer yawned , pushing his cold nose against her cheek . " Yeah , yeah , good morning , " she gasped . " Now scoot . " With that , Singer snorted and found his legs , further squashing various parts of her as he got up . And up . And up . And up . A moment later , towering over her with just a smudge of drool on his lips , he looked like something from a low-budget horror movie . Good Lord , she thought , he is huge . You 'd think that I 'd be used to it by now . She took a deep breath and looked up at him , frowning . " Did I say you could get into bed with me ? " she asked . Singer usually slept in the corner of her room at night . The past two nights , however , he 'd crawled in with her . Or , more accurately , on top of her . Crazy dog . Singer lowered his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiven , " she said , pushing him away . " Do n't even bother trying to get out of this . You could have killed me . You 're almost twice as heavy as I am , you know . Now get off the bed . " Singer whined like a pouting child before hopping down to the floor . Julie sat up , ribs aching , and looked at the clock , thinking , Already ? She and Singer stretched at the same time before she pushed aside the covers . " C'm on , " she said , " I 'll let you out before I get in the shower . But do n't go sniffing around the neighbors ' garbage cans again . They left a nasty message on the machine . " Singer looked at her . " I know , I know , " she said , " it 's only garbage . But some people are funny that way . " Singer left the bedroom , heading toward the front door . Julie rolled her shoulders as she followed him , her eyes closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of the bedroom , she slammed her toe against the dresser . The pain shot from her toe up through her lower leg . After the initial scream , she began to curse , combining profanity in all sorts of marvelous permutations . Hopping on one foot in her pink pajamas , she was sure she looked like some sort of deranged Energizer Bunny . Singer merely gave her a look that seemed to imply , What 's the holdup ? You got me up , remember , so let 's get going here . I 've got things to do outside . She groaned . " Ca n't you see I 'm wounded here ? " Singer yawned again , and Julie rubbed her toe before limping after him . " Thanks for coming to my rescue . You 're worthless in an emergency . " A moment later , after Singer stepped on Julie 's sore toe on his way out the door-Julie knew he 'd done it on purpose-he was outside . Instead of heading toward the garbage cans , Singer wandered over to the vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She watched as he swung his massive head from side to side , as if making sure that no one had planted any new trees or bushes during the preceding day . All dogs liked to mark their territory , but Singer seemed to believe that somehow , if he found enough places to relieve himself , he 'd be anointed King Dog in all the World . At least it got him out of her hair for a while . Thank heaven for small favors , Julie thought . Singer had been driving her crazy for the last couple of days . He 'd followed her everywhere , refusing to let her out of his sight for even a few minutes , except when she put him outside . She had n't even been able to put the dishes away without bumping into him a dozen times . He was even worse at night . Last night , he 'd had a growling fit for an hour , which he 'd thoughtfully interspersed with an occasional bark , and the whole thing had left her fantasizing about buying either a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behavior had ever been ... well , ordinary . Except for the peeing thing , the dog had always acted as if he thought he were human . He refused to eat out of a dog bowl , he 'd never needed a leash , and when Julie watched television , he would crawl up on the couch and stare at the screen . And when she talked to him-whenever anyone talked to him , for that matter-Singer would stare intently , his head tilted to the side , as if he were following the conversation . And half the time , it did seem as if he understood what she was telling him . No matter what she told him to do , no matter how ridiculous the command , Singer would carry it out . Could you go get my purse from the bedroom ? Singer would come trotting out with it a moment later . Will you turn off the bedroom light ? He 'd balance on two legs and flick it with his nose . Put this can of soup in the pantry , okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shelf . Sure , other dogs were well trained , but not like this . Besides , Singer had n't needed training . Not real training , anyway . All she 'd had to do was show him something once and that was it . To others it seemed downright eerie , but since it made Julie feel like a modern-day Dr. Dolittle , she kind of liked it . Even if it did mean she talked to her dog in complete sentences , had arguments with him , and asked for his advice now and then . But hey , she told herself , that was n't so odd , was it ? They 'd been together since Jim had died , just the two of them , and for the most part , Singer was pretty good company . Singer , though , had been acting strangely ever since she started dating again , and he had n't liked any of the guys who 'd shown up at the door in the last couple of months . Julie had expected that part . Since he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he first met them . She used to think that Singer had a sixth sense that enabled him to tell the good guys from the ones she should avoid , but lately she 'd changed her mind . Now , she could n't help but think that he was just a big , furry version of a jealous boyfriend . It was getting to be a problem , she decided . They were going to have to have a serious talk . Singer did n't want her to be alone , did he ? No , of course not . It might take him a little while to get used to having someone else around , but he 'd understand eventually . Hell , in time , he 'd probably even be happy for her . But how , she wondered , was the best way to explain all this to him ? She halted for a moment , considering the question , before realizing the implications of what she was thinking . Explain all this to him ? Good Lord , she thought , I 'm going insane . Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipping off her pajamas as she went . Standing over the sink , she grimaced at her reflection . Look at me , she thought , I 'm twenty-nine and falling apart at the seams here . Her ribs hurt when she breathed , her big toe throbbed , and the mirror , she realized , was n't helping things . During the day , her brown hair was long and straight , but after a night in bed , it looked as if it had been attacked by combteasing pillow gnomes . It was frazzled and puffed out , " under siege , " as Jim so kindly used to put it . Mascara was smeared down her cheek . The tip of her nose was red , and her green eyes were swollen from the springtime pollen . But a shower would help with those things , would n't it ? Well , maybe not with the allergies . She opened the medicine cabinet and took a Claritin before glancing up again , as if hoping for a sudden improvement . Ugh . Maybe , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob 's interest after all . She 'd been cutting Bob 's hair , or rather what was left of it , for a year now . Two months ago , Bob had finally worked up the nerve to ask her out . He was n't exactly the best-looking guy in the world-balding , with a round face , eyes set too close together , and the beginnings of a paunch-but he was single and successful , and Julie had n't been on a date since Jim had died . She figured it would be a good way to get her feet wet in the world of dating again . Wrong . There was a reason Bob was single . Bob was n't only a triple bogey in the looks department , he 'd been so boring on their date that even people at nearby tables in the restaurant had glanced her way in pity . His preferred topic of conversation on their date had been accounting . He 'd showed no interest in anything else : not her , not the menu , not the weather , not sports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting . For three hours , she 'd listened to Bob drone on and on about itemized deductions and capital gains distributions , depreciation and 401(k) rollovers . By the end of the dinner , when he 'd leaned over the table and confided that he " knew important people at the IRS , " Julie 's eyes were so glazed that they could have flavored a dozen doughnuts . It went without saying , of course , that Bob had had a wonderful time . He 'd been calling three times a week since then , asking " if they could get together for a second consultation , hee hee hee . " He was persistent , that was for sure . Annoying as hell , but persistent . Then there was Ross , the second guy she dated . Ross the doctor . Ross the good-looking guy . Ross the pervert . One date with him was enough , thank you very much . And ca n't forget good old Adam . He worked for the county , he said . He enjoyed his work , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found out , worked in the sewers . He did n't smell , he did n't have unknown substances growing under his fingernails , his hair did n't carry a greasy shine , but she knew that as long as she lived , she 'd never get used to the idea that one day , he might show up at the front door looking that way . Had an accident at the plant , dear . Sorry to come home like this . The very thought gave her the shivers . Nor could she imagine handling his clothes to put them in the laundry after something like that . The relationship was doomed from the start . Just when she was beginning to wonder whether normal people like Jim even existed anymore , just when she was beginning to wonder what it was about her that seemed to attract oddballs like a neon sign flashing " I 'm Available-Normalcy Not Required , " Richard had come strolling into the picture . And miracle of miracles , even after a first date last Saturday , he still seemed ... normal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm repairing the bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway-he had made her acquaintance when he came into the salon for a haircut . On their date , he 'd opened doors for her , smiled at the right moments in the conversation , given the waiter her order for dinner , and not so much as tried to kiss her when he 'd dropped her off . Best of all , he was good-looking in an artistic sort of way , with sculpted cheekbones , emerald eyes , black hair , and a mustache . After he 'd dropped her off , she 'd felt like screaming , Hallelujah ! I have seen the light ! Singer had n't seemed quite as impressed . After she 'd said good night to Richard , Singer had put on one of his " I 'm the boss around here " acts . He 'd growled until Julie had opened the front door . " Oh , stop it , " she 'd said . " Do n't be so hard on him . " Singer did as he was told , but he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the night . If my dog was any more bizarre , she thought , we could team up and work for a carnival , right next to the guy who eats light bulbs . But then , my life has n't exactly been normal , either . Julie turned on the faucet and stepped into the shower , trying to stem the tide of memories . What was the use of replaying hard times ? Her mother , she often mused , had been fatally attracted to two things : booze and toxic men . Either one without the other would have been bad , but the combination had been intolerable for Julie . Her mom went through boyfriends the way kids go through paper towels , and some of them made Julie feel less than comfortable once she hit adolescence . The last one had actually tried to have his way with her , and when Julie had told her mother , her mother , in a drunken , teary rage , had blamed her for coming on to him . It was n't long before Julie found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been terrifying even for the six months or so before Jim came along . Most everyone she met used drugs and panhandled or stole ... or worse . Scared of becoming like the haunted runaways she saw every night at the shelters and in the doorways , she searched frantically for odd jobs that would keep her fed and out of sight . She worked every menial job she saw offered and kept her head down . When she first met Jim at a diner in Daytona , she was nursing a cup of coffee with the last of her pocket change . Jim bought her breakfast and on the way out the door said he 'd do the same thing the following day if she returned . Hungry , she did , and when she challenged him about his motives ( she assumed she knew his reasons and could remember gearing up for quite the embarrassing public tirade about cradle robbers and jail time ) , Jim denied any improper interest in her . And at the end of the week , when he was getting ready to head for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Swansboro , North Carolina , he would help her get a full-time job and a place to stay . She remembered staring at him as though he had bugs crawling out of his ears . Continues ...
