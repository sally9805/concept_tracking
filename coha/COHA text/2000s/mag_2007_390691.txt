Where the devil is that thing ? " I hear myself saying . It is almost noon , and I 'm finishing a surgical procedure to remove a cancer of the esophagus from a 54-year-old man . I 've already brought his stomach up into his chest to replace the esophagus . He should be able to eat normally within a week . Only our " sponge count " is incorrect , and I ca n't close the chest until we find the six-by-six-inch piece of cloth we call a " lap pad . " The nurses have turned the operating room upside down . They 've emptied all the " biological " waste baskets , searched the floor , rustled all the sterile drapes and recounted the used lap pads . Additional help has been summoned to the room while I am looking in the chest for the missing pad and seeing only the patient 's steadily beating heart . Everybody in the room knows that prolonging the operation has a deleterious effect on the man who has entrusted us with his care . Body fluids evaporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls because of evaporation and the cool room temperature . Yet we ca n't close until we find the damn thing . How can anybody lose a sponge the size of a dinner napkin inside a human being ? It is easier than you might think . In fact , medical harm is more common than those of us who celebrate the " most advanced health-care system in the world " would like to admit . In 2000 , the Institute of Medicine published a book called " To Err Is Human , " which claimed that as many as 100,000 patients are killed each year by medical error . A death from error is one thing ; leaving a sponge behind is a less fatal but still stunning mistake . The Institute for Health Care Improvement calculated last year that the medical profession inflicts 15 million " incidents of harm " ( like a retained sponge ) per year in this country . The reasons for these almost unbelievable figures are multiple and interrelated . Medicine today is complex . Because medicine is a " profession " and many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that doctors have the patients ' best interests at heart . But without any central database for our care , a patient I plan to operate on next week may be , right now , in a doctor 's office getting a prescription for a drug that will make the proposed operation more dangerous . Unless I ask , I 'll never know . In addition , there are many more drugs , procedures and techniques today than when I graduated from medical school in 1970 , yet we have n't learned how to keep up with it all . Information travels remarkably slowly in medicine . Then there is the culture of the medical profession . Uncooperative behavior by physicians has been tolerated by frustrated nurses and hospital administrators whose bonuses are tied to the hospital revenue generated by these doctors . Intimidating behavior has long been a facet of surgical training . I learned from the best : surgeons who would slap residents during a case , intimidate nurses or throw instruments . Most did n't , but some did . Recently a **27;1415;TOOLONG nurse told me she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " guide wire " for an arterial catheter . He ignored her hint and perforated the patient 's aorta , then told the family that the accident and subsequent emergency surgery were the nurse 's fault . " Do you think I 'll ever try to help him again ? " she asked . Most everybody I know in medicine is bright , hardworking and altruistic . Many , though , have been beaten down by hundreds of urgent pages , middle-of-the-night phone calls , decreasing reimbursement , more paperwork and less grateful patients . These doctors have become less careful , and their patients suffer as a result . It is time for my colleagues and me to reclaim our profession . It is time for doctors and nurses to work together , time for electronic records to actually work in providing the right information to the right person , time for pharmacists and nurses and social workers and doctors to see patients together . You 'll notice I did n't say it is time to pay doctors more money . If we can see and help our patients in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the compensation we need . It turns out that the sponge had accidentally been sent to the pathology lab . An alert nurse , a longtime colleague of mine , thought to call the lab . It all ended well . I hope my profession does , too . Karl Lives In Tampa , Fla .
