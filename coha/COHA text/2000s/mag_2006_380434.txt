What would the most advanced , most forward-looking , most self-assured country in history do without its periodic crises of confidence ? In 1957 the Soviets put a tin can into space , and the U.S. thought the sky was falling . In the 1980s we began crying into our soup because Sony was selling so many nifty Trinitrons . " American decline " was all the fashion until the vaunted Japanese model of tight organization and industrial planning took a nosedive and a bunch of twentysomething Americans tinkering in their garages created untold wealth and took over the world . <P> Now , 20 years later , our newest fix of pessimism . Why ? Our economic growth rate is second in the West only to tiny Finland 's . It 's probably just a symptom of $3 gasoline . Nonetheless , it 's back . This time it 's not Russia or Japan but other inscrutable foreigners , Indian and Chinese . What was once rather unkindly said about Brazil  --  " the country of the future and always will be "  --  I say of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick your statistics . Mine are that the U.S. leads the world by an immense margin in just about every measure of intellectual and technological achievement : Ph.D.s , patents , peer-reviewed articles , Nobel Prizes . But in the end , it 's the culture , stupid . The economy follows culture , and American culture is today , as ever , uniquely suited for growth , innovation and advancement . <P> The most obvious bedrock of success is entrepreneurial spirit . The U.S. has the most risk-taking , most laissez-faire , least regulated economy in the advanced Western world . America is heartily disdained by its coddled and controlled European cousins for its cowboy capitalism . But it is precisely America 's tolerance for creative destruction  --  industries failing , others rising , workers changing jobs and cities and skills with an alacrity and insouciance that Europeans find astonishing  --  that keeps its economy churning and advancing . <P> Some are alarmed that government R &D; funding has fallen from a 60% to a 30% share of total funding . So what ? Does government necessarily make wiser investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japanese and so many others was to assume that creativity could be achieved with enough government planning and funding . But the very essence of creativity is spontaneity . A society 's creativity is directly proportionate to the rate of free interaction of people and ideas in a vast unplanned national chemical reaction . There is no country anywhere more given to the unencumbered , unfettered , unregulated exchange of ideas than the U.S. <P> And not just ideas but also the people who give life to them . America is uniquely socially mobile , ethnically mixed and racially tolerant . America is , in Ben Wattenberg 's phrase , the first universal nation , indeed the only universal nation . Every street corner in New York City is a rainbow of humanity . The resulting interaction and fusion of cultures produce not just great cuisine and music and art but also great science and technology . Intel was cofounded by a Hungarian , Google by a Russian , Yahoo ! by a Taiwanese . We are the world 's masters of assimilation . Where else do you see cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China ?
