The Los Angeles Diaries A Memoir Winter 1994 Fire Winter is the season of the arsonist in Southern California . The manzanita and chaparral are dry and brittle and the Santa Ana winds have begun to blow . They move at gale force . They cross the arid Mojave and whip through the canyons of the San Bernardino Mountains , through the live oak and the pines , the ponderosa , the sugar and coulter , white fir and incense cedar . I know these names because I live in these mountains , eighty miles east of the sprawl of Los Angeles , and I worry when the winds come . I worry about the possibility of fire . I know he 's out there , the arsonist . I know he 's waiting , like me , for a day of opportunity very much like this . I 've seen the Santa Anas uproot trees . I 've seen them strip roofing from houses and shatter windows . I 've seen them topple big rigs , and once , along the same freeway I 'm traveling now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I keep a firm hold on the wheel . The winds hit in sharp gusts and can blow you clean over the line . You have to be ready . You have to hang on tight and keep your eyes on the road . Traffic moves slowly , carefully . No one 's taking any chances , making abrupt lane changes , cutting you off or tail-gating . I would like to believe that it 's courtesy that dictates our caution , our good manners , except this is Southern California , I grew up here and I know better . Danger or its potential sometimes brings out the best in us , and I wonder , as I reach to turn on the radio , if maybe it would be a good thing if the Santa Anas blew every day all year-round . From time to time I find myself having to drive into Los Angeles on business , and just the thought of it always fills me with a sense of dread and anxiety . The city has changed and grown immensely since I knew it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets I grew up on , seem barely recognizable . Gated communities have replaced the bungalows and tract homes and the signs in the windows of the shops and stores are in Vietnamese , Korean , Spanish , occasionally Arabic . Where corner markets once stood you 'll now find minimalls , and Hollywood landmarks , places like Schwab 's and Pandora 's Box and the old Brown Derby restaurant , have gone the way of the bulldozer . There are more freeways , too , bigger and wider ones , but the traffic has never been worse . But it is n't the unfamiliar that makes me anxious . It is n't the traffic or the crowds or the evolving landscape of architecture and ethnicity . I am a fiction writer who does n't make enough money at it not to have to do something else for a living . So I teach . So I am a professor . And what Hollywood offers me is the chance to escape the classroom and tell stories full-time . Trouble is , I 'm not very good at telling stories that pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what it has always been about : my driving into Hollywood to talk to producers and executives who like my work but want me to write something more commercial . In this case that less commercial work is my last novel and the screenplay I wrote based on it , a screenplay commissioned by Universal and Amblin , both of whom passed on it when I was done . " I do n't know why you ever bothered to write this , " an executive tells me , after she finishes reading my script . " It 's no movie . It 's too real . " Now the rights are mine and my agent , who feels differently than the executive , is sending it to other executives and producers in Hollywood . As a sample , he calls it . The idea is not so much to sell the script as it is to sell myself as a scriptwriter . Already I 'm looking forward to the end of the day . The Santa Anas die down as I approach Los Angeles and I ease up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's only temporary , this calm . I know better than to let myself relax . That thing called the L.A. River borders the last stretch of the freeway into Burbank , and I look out on it , the dirty water , moving sluggishly through the narrow concrete channel that contains it . Over the rush of the cars I try to imagine it as I was told it used to be , a real river , filled with trout and salmon and lined with sycamores and willows instead of chain-link and barbed wire . But I 'm not successful . I think about my brother . I think about my sister . We are children down by that river on a day very much like this with the wind blowing lightly and the smell of fire in the air . I 'm nine years old , the youngest , and we 're passing a bottle around , a bottle I 've stolen from a grocery store nearby . My sister points to the sky . " Look . Look , " she says . " Snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashes are everywhere , and in the sunlight they appear white , almost translucent . My head is spinning and I laugh . My brother laughs . I can hear us all laughing as we look to the sky , opening our mouths , catching ashes , like snowflakes , until our tongues turn black . In the rearview mirror I check to see if my eyes are clear . They are , and they should be . I 've gone without a drink or a drug for four days , four long miserable days of white-knuckling it , all because I want to look my best , and I like to think I do ...
