Photos/ Anthony Cunha. // FRANK LLOYD GALLERY , SANTA MONICA , CALIFORNIA NOVEMBER 18- DECEMBER 30 , 2000 Working in Los Angeles , John Mason made his initial mark on the art world in the late 1950s and early 60s with massive clay walls , vessels and floor pieces . Roughhewn and forcefully constructed , these muscular works embodied the revolutionary energy of a period that saw the transformation of functional ceramics into expressive artworks . Mason took a different direction in the early 70s , when he produced modular , site-specific floor pieces made of manufactured firebrick , but he returned to forming clay in the 1980s and has continued to evolve as a sculptor with an enormous capacity for growth and refinement . The latest evidence of his achievement is this exhibition of 20 slab-built pieces , ranging from 15 inches to 5 1/2 feet high . Encompassing three closely related series- Vertical Torques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the richness of Mason 's repertoire . Crisp , clear and similar as they may appear at first , they are packed with subtle complexities and variations . The Vertical Torques are modular constructions of triangular slabs , joined at one or two sides and then stacked in two or three tiers . Rather like rectangular volumes that have been twisted and broken apart , they unfold into open compartments and peak in inverted pyramids . Like all Mason 's work , the Torques are sharply articulated , with variations in the glaze density that accentuate their diagonal joints . Still , it is n't easy to comprehend the totality of their form . Masterfully dynamic , they compel one to walk around them again and again . But each aspect is different , so the work never reveals itself completely . The SpearForms and Figures are also powerfully elusive . Like the unfolding Torques , they bring to mind large-scale origami , except that they are asymmetrical and unpredictable . Rising to adult heights , they assume an almost human presence . Some of the tallest bear a slight resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcel Duchamp 's famous 1912 painting . These works are also related to Italian Futurist painting and sculpture , which infused Cubist form with the appearance of movement . As these historical connections suggest , Mason 's work is grounded in modernist abstraction rather than ceramic traditions , but he has forged his own path as a sculptor in clay . As his work has developed over 45 years , Mason has maintained a consistent sensibility and revisited early imagery . At the same time , he has moved forward . The early monolithic rectangles , crosses and X-shapes have given way to more complicated geometric configurations . And his SpearForms give new life to works he made on the wheel in the ig5os and recall his first large-scale sculpture , made in 1957 . Now constructed of leather-dry slabs that fan out from a shifting center , the Spears are composed of adjoining planes that create open-ended volumes . The Figures are the surprise of the show because , as their titles suggest , they push Mason into the unfamiliar ( for him ) territory of figurative art . Experimenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when he saw undeniably figurative qualities emerge , he acknowledged the shift . Still fundamentally an abstractionist , he has pushed his own boundaries just far enough to give his work an additional dimension in this series . The eight Figures on view-glazed in blue , black , gray , white or earth tones-taper toward the top while twisting their heads and torsos . Some are sleek , straight-edged characters that might have been inspired by men in capes . Others , relatively chunky , are curvilinear personages with protruding hips and saucy attitudes . Despite Mason 's longstanding interest in geometric abstraction and modular construction , he seems to have an intuitive knack for striking a balance that 's slightty off-kilter . This work feels right partly because it is so fresh and intriguing .
