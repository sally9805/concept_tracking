The myriad visual correspondences between Alfred Hitchcock s movies and modern art are explored in an exhibition that travels to the Centre Pompidou this month . // Works of art can possess ominous power in Alfred Hitchcock 's films . In Blackmail ( 1929 ) , a painting of a laughing jester seems to mock Alice White from the easel of the artist she has just killed . Guilt-ridden and fearful , she lashes out , ripping the canvas . A portrait of her predecessor torments the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter in Rebecca ( 1940 ) , Hitchcock 's American debut , while the ancestral image of Carlotta Valdez , enshrined in a museum in Vertigo ( 1957 ) , appears to drive Madeleine Elster mad . But " Hitchcock and Art , " a fascinating exhibition organized by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts , does more than merely survey the director 's oeuvre for sightings of paintings or sculptures . Cocurators Guy Cogeval and Dominique Paini , directors of the Montreal Museum and the Parisian Cinematheque Franqaise respectively , situate Hitchcock 's 50 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 20th centuries . Film clips , storyboards , publicity stills and costume designs are provocatively juxtaposed with works in all mediums by diverse artists ranging from Edward Burne-Jones to Julia Margaret Cameron , Auguste Rodin , Edvard Munch , Max Ernst , Bridget Riley and many others . Subtitled " Fatal Coincidences , " the exhibition reveals myriad correspondences among these objects in iconography and style , formal and narrative strategies , mood and recurring themes . Literary and cinematic parallels are noted as well . According a popular filmmaker such expansive treatment is an unusual endeavor for an art museum , although in 1999 , the centenary of Hitchcock 's birth , the Oxford Museum of Modern Art organized another kind of homage : " Notorious : Alfred Hitchcock and Contemporary Art " surveyed video and sound works , photographs and installations by artists directly referencing or inspired by movies like Rear Window ( 1953 ) , Psycho ( 1959-60 ) and Marnie ( 1963-64 ) . Victor Burgin began this artistic engagement with Hitchcock in his psychoanalytic treatment of Vertigo , a text and photo-panel piece titled The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international , exemplified by Judith Barry , Stan Douglas , Pierre Huyghe and David Reed , among others , The pervasive appeal of Hitchcock in recent years is attributable to multiple and diverse factors , not the least of which must be technological ( the advent of the VCR ) and theoretical ( the ascendancy of semiotics and psychoanalysis as interpretive models ) . Surely contemporary artists are equally seduced by the potent psychology of Hitchcock 's oeuvre , his manipulation of Freudian concepts and , above all , his masterly production of a realist , narrative cinema injected with his own supremely self-conscious artifice . While Oxford 's " Notorious " approached the films of Britain 's native son as a source or , perhaps better , a resource for contemporary visual artists , " Hitchcock and Art " instead seeks to contextualize his esthetic historically . It 's notable that this ambitious , celebratory project was initiated by two Frenchmen . At the forefront of film studies and theory , French intellectuals of Cahiers du cinema long ago recognized Hitchcock 's status as auteur , devoting a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews with him appeared in 1962 , followed by his Cinema selon Hitchcock in 1966.1 Cogeval , moreover , is an expert on European Symbolist art and aims to show how Hitchcock 's sensibilities , especially toward female beauty and romantic yearning , developed from this poetic attitude of the 19th century . Symbolists and PreRaphaelites defined the remote , even unattainable woman , cloaked in mystery , later embodied in characters like the spectral Madeleine Elster or the frigid antiheroine of Marnie . Images associating love and death , desire and drowning  --  John Everett Millais 's Study for Ophelia ( 1852 ) , Willy Schlobach 's The Dead Woman ( 1890 ) - predict morbid Hitchcock obsessions and the watery tableau of Madeleine 's suicidal plunge into the San Francisco Bay . A contemporary tribute to Hitchcock 's dramatic mise-en-scene , sans femme , is also included-a color photograph by Cindy Bernard of the Golden Gate Bridge , Ask the Dust : Vertigo ( 1990 ) . Although this ricochet of sources , homages and " coincidences " old and new creates a tangled web , the exhibition refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on varied possibilities . A gallery of illustrations for the stories of Edgar Allan Poe by artists like Alfred Kubin , Odilon Redon and the Italian Symbolist Alberto Martini reminds us that Hitchcock knowingly modeled his efforts in suspense on Poe 's dark " spellbinding logic . " 2 In other instances , the relationships posited are tentative , as when Hitchcock clips are compared with similar scenes from Luis Bunuel , Jean Cocteau and Fritz Lang . Does the struggle between Scottie Ferguson and Madeleine/Judy in the mission bell tower in Vertigo derive from an episode in Bunuel 's El ( 1952 ) , or the shower murder in Psycho from Lang 's While the City Sleeps ( 1956 ) ? The viewer must decide . Where Lang is concerned , it 's clear at least that Hitchcock shared the German 's genius for orchestrating light and dark for psychological effects . Early in his career , working in Berlin and Munich in 1924 and 1925 respectively , Hitchcock had been exposed to the techniques of Expressionist cinema at UFA and Emelka Studios . Stills and storyboards in " Hitchcock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expressionist motif of the shadowy staircase to create mystery in Blackmail , Number Seventeen ( 1932 ) and Shadow of a Doubt ( 1942 ) , while a nighttime view of the little English hamlet in Murder !

This latter Murder ! image appears in a gallery devoted to " disquiet , " exploring how haunted cities , castles silhouetted against the evening sky , abandoned buildings or isolated structures like the tattered windmill in Foreign Correspondent ( 1940 ) arouse a sense of foreboding . Hitchcock , the exhibition suggests , took his cues from a visual tradition harking back to the Romanticism of J.M.W. Turner and , later , Arnold Bocklin , whose lonely , windswept ruins may well have inspired the director 's conception of the burnt-out estate of Manderley , looming up through darkness and mist in the opening scenes of Rebecca . The Gothic structures of Quebec City , seen from a low vantage point against gray clouds , produce a similar quality of unease at the beginning of I Confess ( 1952 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , A la Edward Hopper circa 1927 , was the ideal domicile for the crazed ghost of Mrs. Bates in Psycho .

Estate of Rene Ma.6tte/ADAGP , Paris/SODRAC , Montreal . // Disquiet also stems from the kind of agoraphobic spaces depicted in paintings by Ralston Crawford , Whitestone Bridge or Overseas Highway ( both 1939 ) , with no trace of human presence . In these , or in earlier drawings by the Belgian Symbolist Leon Spillaert of vast empty strands that dwarf nocturnal figures , one recognizes , as did Hitchcock , the possibilities for alienation , for rendering solitary beings physically and psychologically vulnerable . Comparisons are drawn , too , between Giorgio de Chirico 's metaphysical spaces , with their stark columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Museum in Blackmail , where the villainous Tracy meets his demise , and the stony monuments of Washington , D.C. , that tower behind Bruno Antony , the dangerous psychopath in Strangers on a Train ( 1950 ) . The best-known instance of Hitchcock 's direct reliance on precedents in painting is the Surrealist dream sequence in Spellbound ( 1944 ) , for which he hired none other than Salvador Dali to visualize John Ballantine 's nightmare . ' " Hitchcock and Art " includes three grisaille studies Dali produced for the movie and a painting , The Eye ( 1944 ) , given to the director after the shoot was completed , as well as a re-creation of the great curtain with staring eyes that 's sliced with a gigantic scissors in the dream . A monitor in the same gallery broadcasts the nightmare in all its vivid strangeness-excluding Dali 's image , excised from the film by producer David 0 . Selznick , of Ballantine 's psychiatrist ( Ingrid Bergman ) transformed into a white statue . Originally , the dream was a full 15 minutes long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting the movie , was away in England . The lost scenes , captured in photographs in the exhibition of a marmoreal Bergman on the set , testify to the legendary tension between Selznick and his creative rival . A staple of Surrealism , the theme of woman as statue recurs in a painting by Rene Magritte , Deep Waters ( 1941 ) , where an uncanny marble figure in coat and gloves is accompanied by an incongruously huge bird . The resemblance between the Magritte and a publicity photo for The Birds ( 1962 ) is striking : Tippi Hedren , a big crow perched on her arm , is statuesque in a glamorous cocktail sheath . Hedren is among the many Hitchcock heroines pictured in the exhibition , which foregrounds his celebrated " type , " a cool blonde , often described as " icy " and inaccessible . The statue metaphor gives added meaning to his predilection for clothing female leads in long white gowns with pleated skirts , thus casting Bergman , Joan Fontaine and-in Edith Head 's costume designs for To Catch a Thief ( 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns . A painting of Pygmalion and Galatea ( ca. 1926 ) by Franz von Stuck invites us to consider the more universal trope of woman as image , fashioned by man according to his desire , as Hitchcock , for instance , literally transformed Hedren from model to movie star or as Scottie recreates Madeleine from Judy in Vertigo . Although a gallery of beautiful blondes-including stunning Technicolor sequences of Hedren in Marnie , Kelly in Rear Window and Kim Novak in Vertigo-allows viewers to luxuriate in the visual pleasure of what Hitchcock wrought , an untitled film still ( 1979 ) by Cindy Sherman posing in a white slip subtly reminds us that such eroticized icons are masculinist constructions . Also illuminated in the exhibition is the fetishizing of feminine hair and body parts that film theorist Laura Mulvey identified as a crucial defensive mechanism of the male unconscious in classic Hollywood cinema.4 But the tendency is peculiar neither to Hitchcock nor to film : Vertigo 's loving close-up of Madeleine 's blonde chignon and the fascinated caress of the back of Eve Kendall 's neck in North by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Edouard Vuillard , The Nape of Misia 's Neck ( ca 189799 ) , and Domenico Gnoli , Curly Red Hair ( 1969 ) . The libidinous investment in women 's accessories seems ubiquitous , as we encounter images of Psycho 's Marion Crane in girdle and lacy brassiere , or Marnie 's soft leather purse ( stuffed with stolen money ) gripped tightly under her arm or Catherine Lacy 's shiny high-heel pumps in The Lady Vanishes ( 1938 ) . It 's the same urge to fragment , isolate and cathect found in Alfred Stieglitz 's 1919 photograph of a woman 's leg , stockinged and tightly shod or , earlier , in Max Klinger 's suite of etchings ( 1881 ) unfolding a tale of a man 's desperate obsession with a woman 's glove . An amazing surprise in this category is a painting in the show by German Realist Wilhelm Leibl , The Corset ( ca. 1880-81 ) , which fixates on a woman 's cinched waist , every pleat in her apron , every fold on her sleeve detailed with almost lascivious attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , video installation , 18 by 18 by 103% inches .

If the menaced eyes in Spellbound 's dream signify castration , the look in Psycho and Rear Window is also phallic-witness Norman Bates spying on his victim through a peephole ( a picture of Susanna and the Elders on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoto lens , the better to observe Miss Torso and her neighbors across the courtyard . Clips from these films indicate how effectively Hitchcock implicates the moviegoer as voyeur : in the opening scene in Psycho , the camera pans across Phoenix until it finds a window with blinds slightly raised , then sneaks beneath them into a room where Marion lies in her underwear , her lover standing over her . Hitchcock indulges his and his viewers ' voyeurism while also positioning them as guilty pervertsPeeping Toms . Across the century , a number of other works present scopophilia as a common feature of the modern city : Auguste Chabaud 's painting HotelHotel ( 1907-08 ) of neon nightlife populated by disembodied eyes ; Andre Kertesz 's photograph of a couple , backs turned to his camera , peeking through cracks in a fence in Circus , May 19 , 1920 ; and Alain Fleischer 's nocturnal projection of pornographic images on the brick wall of an apartment building in Exhibition in the North of France ( 1992 ) . The witty inclusion of Magritte 's 1937 photo of Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist 's paintings , suggests to the exhibition 's visitors how they , too , participate in the kind of activity in question . The active gaze is the subject of Tony Oursler 's video installation Seed ( 1996 ) , where the image of an eye watching Brian de Palma 's Dressed to Kill is projected onto an 18-inch sphere ; we see the searching , blinking , pupil-dilating eyeball engaged and excited by the violent film reflected on its surface . Movies , theater , circus , sideshow , all cater to the hungry eyes of the crowd in paintings by Walter Sickert , Georges Rouault and Guy Pine du Bois , while framed stills and clips from Murder ! , The Thirty-Nine Steps ( 1935 ) , Saboteur ( 1942 ) , Stage Fright ( 1950 ) and I Confess illustrate some of the many instances in Hitchcock when scenes of violence take place as spectacle , literally onstage . These frequent allusions to theater within Hitchcock 's dramas , like plays within plays or pictures within pictures , underscore his self-awareness as an artist , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 backlit stillsfrom an ad for weight reduction read by William Bendix in Lifeboat ( 1943 ) to a bus ride with Cary Grant in To Catch a Thief-serve as signs of his presence and authorship .

" 6 These were suficient subjects for Rouault to express his moral outrage and Christian sentiment , and one of the numerous revelations of " Hitchcock and Art " is how the director 's own Catholic background emerges in vignettes that resemble religious tableaux familiar from painting : a Deposition in The Lodger ( 1927 ) , a Pieta in Topaz ( 1969 ) , Christ Mocked in I Confess .

It 's significant ( though beyond the purview of the exhibition 's French organizers ) that these two persecution films , with their Christological overtones , were made during the grim days of the McCarthy hearings . The Hollywood Ten were imprisoned in 1950 ; Arthur Miller was subpoenaed before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in 1956 and , refusing-like Father Logan-to name names in order to preserve his own , was tried for contempt and convicted the following year .

HRCs were defined as college courses with withdrawal or failure rates of 30% or more . Indepth interviews were conducted with 13 students enrolled in four different HRCs . Isolation , academic challenge , ownership , and acquiescence emerged as structural themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermingled in discrete ways that led to the survival or surrender of these HRC participants and formed the essence of the phenomenon that is referred to as delicate engagement , which speaks to the vulnerable threads of academic and social involvement that permeated the HRC student experience . <p> Keywords : online courses , ; student success , ; phenomenology <p> Nationwide , the number of students enrolled in online courses has grown at a rapid rate . Student enrollment from the fall of 2004 to the fall of 2005 increased from 2.3 million to nearly 3.2 million ( Allen &; Seaman , 2006 ) . The 2005 online enrollment represented 17% of all higher education students . Allen and Seaman ( 2006 ) found that 96% of all higher education public institutions provided opportunities for online learners . Associate 's degree-granting institutions , such as community colleges , enrolled more than half of all online learners . <p> Online courses provide many community college students with new opportunities to participate in postsecondary education ( Cox , 2005 ; Dalziel , 2003 ; Kozeracki , 1999 ; Young , 2008 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students because work and family obligations limit attendance in traditional synchronous , on-campus classes . Some students enroll in online courses to expand their schedule of classes or limit the cost of commuting . Health care workers , fire fighters , and police officers find online learning compatible with their dynamic shift schedules . In addition , parents of small children can reduce child care expenditures by taking online classes . <p> As online learning options expand , however , these new opportunities are accompanied by higher attrition rates ( Berge &; Mrozowski , 2001 ; Carr , 2000 ) . Carr 's ( 2000 ) inquiry into online learning at several community colleges indicated that student attrition increases when the instructor and the student are in different locations . Studies of online student attrition and persistence conducted at individual community colleges confirm Carr 's findings , reporting dropout rates that are 15% to 50% higher in online classes than in the same synchronous face-to-face options ( Crabtree , 2000 ; Kennedy , 2001 ; Pedone , 2003 ; York , 2003 ) . As community colleges continue to expand opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why large numbers of these students withdraw or fail these courses . <p> This article reports on a qualitative study that used the phenomenological method to examine the lived experiences of students enrolled in challenging online courses at a community college in the American Southeast . Our main objective was to determine if participants in such online courses shared a common experience that superseded their individual successes or failures . We discuss our study in the following manner . First , we briefly review the relevant literature on community college online learners . Second , we explain our research method , phenomenology , and discuss data collection and analysis procedures . Third , we present and interpret our findings in a section that outlines four structural themes that describe the experiences reported by our student participants . We then describe and explain the essence of the phenomenon that we refer to as a " delicate engagement " . Finally , we close with a summary and recommendations for practice and research . <p> L : Literature Review The literature regarding distance education at the community college has confirmed its rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseline for examining the early development of distance education at community colleges . Kozeracki based her work on several sources , including statistical data from United States Department of Education reports and documentary data collected from community college course listings , catalogs , and enrollment reports . She found that in the late 1990s only a small portion of the curriculum was offered via distance technologies . However , she reported that between 58% and 79% of the institutions surveyed in two national studies offered at least some courses via distance technology . More recently , Cox ( 2005 ) examined the adoption of online education at 15 community colleges in six states . Cox 's work , based primarily on documentary and interview data , found that the institutions ' adoption of online courses was driven to a large extent by myths regarding the utility of online courses as a means of satisfying student interests and demands , the need to adopt online education to survive greater competition in the higher education marketplace , and the notion that online education was enhancing students ' technological literacy . Cox maintained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected context-specific institutional forces and interests . These two studies ( Cox , 2005 ; Kozeracki , 1999 ) showed how researchers are attempting to describe and understand the development of this important innovation in the community college curriculum . <p> Since Kozeracki 's ( 1999 ) study , the literature has focused more specifically on various aspects of community college online courses and on the students enrolled in them . Dissertation research has reported on student performance ( Bangurah , 2004 ; Crabtree , 2000 ) , the experience of student learning ( Harbeck , 2001 ; Pedone , 2003 ; Schilke , 2001 ) , student satisfaction ( Aljarrah , 2000 ; Reed , 2001 ) , and student retention ( York , 2003 ) . Research concerning student performance in online courses at 4-year colleges and universities is progressing along similar lines ( e.g. , Dupin-Bryant , 2004 ; Morris , Wu , &; Finnegan , 2005 ; Schreck , 2003 ) . For example , Schreck ( 2003 ) reported on efforts made by one university 's faculty and staff to retain students in online courses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify student record variables that came closest to predicting retention in one university 's general education online courses . Researchers in both community college and university settings are still seeking to identify and then understand the variables most likely to predict retention ( e.g. , Dupin-Bryant , 2004 ; Morris et al. , 2005 ) and the complex life experiences of students enrolled in online courses ( e.g. , Harbeck , 2001 ; Pedone , 2003 ; Schilke , 2001 ) . Our specific interest was in understanding the life experiences of community college students enrolled in high-risk online courses ( HRCs ) , that is , courses in which 30% or more of the students withdraw from the course or earn final course grades of D or F ( Pascarella &; Terenzini , 2005 ) . An extensive review of the literature revealed no research on this topic . <p> L : Method We selected phenomenology as our qualitative method for research . This approach allowed for an in-depth inquiry of participants sharing a common experience ( Moustakas , 1994 ) . Phenomenology also afforded us an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our universal research question : What is the lived experience of community college students enrolled in HRCs ? <p> The community college selected for our study published a distance learning research report providing an analysis of enrollment in all online courses offered in 2003-2004 . The report compared 25 courses delivered online and on campus . Following Pascarella and Terenzini 's ( 2005 ) definition of an HRC , we identified 13 online courses in which 30% or more of the students withdrew or earned final course grades of D or F. From the list of HRCs , we selected the four courses with the highest rates ( 40%-76% ) of withdrawal or final course grades of D or F. The HRCs selected for this study were the following : principles of accounting I , precalculus , statistics , and basic computer skills . <p> All students enrolled in these four HRCs from the spring of 2005 through the summer of 2006 were sent an e-mail invitation to participate in the study . All participants were required to be enrolled in a program leading to a degree or certificate at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in our study . Our primary researcher collected data through private , face-to-face , in-depth interviews to gain a rich understanding of their experiences ( Fontana &; Frey , 2000 ) . Interviews lasted 60 to 90 minutes each . A standard but flexible protocol with broad discussion topics was used to guide the interviews ( Moustakas , 1994 ) . Questions asked participants to describe their experiences as community college students enrolled in an HRC , what the experiences meant for them , how the experiences affected them , and what opportunities and obstacles were encountered in the HRC . E-mail and brief telephone conversations were used for follow-up conversations with participants to clarify and check data for accuracy . <p> Of the 13 community college students who participated , three had experience in two HRCs . This allowed us to collect data from sixteen course experiences . Eight participants were women and five were men . Participants ranged in age from the early 20s to the early 60s . Eight participants completed their HRCs and two of the eight completed two different HRCs . This allowed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from or failed their HRCs . The participants ' experiences included both completion and withdrawal or failure in principles of accounting I , statistics , and basic computer skills . One experience in precalculus was reported ; in this instance , the participant withdrew from the course . <p> The interview transcriptions and follow-up e-mail messages were used to create typed , electronic data sets for all 13 participants . Pseudonyms were assigned to each participant , assuring confidentiality . Moustakas 's four major processes were used to analyze and interpret data : epoche , phenomenological reduction , imaginative variation , and synthesis of composite textural and structural descriptions . As we followed these processes , we developed a procedure to organize , analyze , and synthesize the individual portions of our data . Adaptation of Moustakas 's method allowed us to articulate our participants ' collective voices and the essence of the phenomenon that emerged in those voices . <p> L : Findings and Interpretation Participants ' voices ( presented here through pseudonyms ) combined to form four structured themes that defined the participants ' lived experiences in their HRCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acquiescence . All participants experienced isolation and academic challenge in some way and to some degree . Where they differed , however , was in how they responded to these experiences . Data analysis revealed that some responded through ownership . Others responded through acquiescence . <p> Isolation The structural theme of isolation describes the loneliness participants felt as they experienced their HRCs . Data analysis confirmed that four dimensions of the students ' HRC experience contributed to their sense of isolation : the surreal HRC classroom , the lack of student-instructor interaction , the void in student-to-student connections , and the possibility of a different experience . <p> The surreal HRC classroom . Participants ' voices portrayed the HRC classroom as a surreal and intangible place . They articulated the difficulty of interpreting an abstract concept in a virtual world and then attempting to apply it in their real world . To make the classroom feel real , they needed to connect the virtual world to their real world through an inanimate object , a computer , and intangible technology . As they logged into their course management system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course documents , interacting with other students on the class discussion board , interacting with their instructors through the courseware email , and dropping assignments into a digital drop box . Many participants knew the virtual classroom could be a lively , dynamic place , but it was not so in these HRCs . On the contrary , these virtual classrooms were static . Participants reported that the discussion board was used minimally with no meaningful student or instructor interaction . Responses from instructors to emails or discussion board postings were often cryptic and incomplete . Without a requirement to interact with other students or the instructor , many participants downloaded the course documents and essentially took the class offline . Alyson and Carly both said , " It 's not the same as being in a regular class , you do n't have a teacher . " Sandy described the isolation she felt by saying , " I thought that it was a lot of teaching myself ... I was by myself a lot . I remember feeling left out . " Samantha added , " I do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What class ? What professor ? What assignments ? ... The online courses seem almost surreal . " The experience of isolation tempted HRC participants to believe there was no class at all . <p> The lack of student-instructor interaction . Struggling to find life within their classrooms , participants reached out to establish a relationship with others . Unlike traditional campus classes where , as Keith said , " there are other people around you to talk to , where you can figure out what is going on , " HRC participants did not see anyone , and they did not have a sense that anyone was present . David explained , " I do n't feel like there was an instructor presence ... I do n't feel like there was anything that I was learning from the instructor . The instructor was simply there as a Web administrator or as a grader . " When our participants tried to contact their instructors , some received very limited and unhelpful replies . Geraldine explained that whenever anyone would ask a question , the instructor would respond monosyllabically : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... It was a two word answer ... you sort of felt slapped . " In some cases participants received no reply at all . In many instances , the only feedback they received on class assignments was a score in the electronic course grade book . Participants reported that the interaction between the instructors and participants decreased as the semester progressed , leaving the students with a greater sense of isolation . Keith said : <p> pre-formatted table The void in student-to-student connections . Participants explained that they had little or no contact with other students in their HRC classrooms . There was no chance to hear the perspectives of others , no opportunity to learn from each other . Geraldine summarized the importance of student-to-student connections , " I think the interaction among students is everything ! " David echoed the value of student-to-student connections and said , " Not only are you learning from yourself , from the manual , from the instructor , but you are also learning from the other people in the class . " What our participants found was aptly described by Samantha as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction is nonexistent ! I know nothing about these people ! " They had no sense of community within the HRCs , no peer interaction . Geraldine remarked , " I was just sort of on this island , all by myself . " David echoed her sentiments when he said , " I felt like , specifically in that HRC class , I was alone and adrift . " For some participants , the need to have a student community was in David 's words " ultimate " , and for others like Julie " a huge obstacle to try to overcome . " The void in student-to-student interaction intensified the sense of isolation felt by our participants . <p> The possibility of a different experience . Through their experiences in other online classes , many participants realized virtual classrooms could be vibrant , interactive , and filled with life . Participants knew there were ways to reduce the feelings of isolation that ran rampant throughout the HRCs . The remedy for their isolation was human interaction . Participants saw the instructor-student interaction and student-to-student connections as the conduit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they did not find the human element within their HRCs , their feelings of isolation became an important aspect of their experience . <p> Academic Challenge Academic challenge articulates the sometimes overwhelming feelings participants faced as challenges were posed by course content and delivery . For many participants , expectations for their HRCs were not realized . In most cases , they believed the academic content would be easy to understand . Instead , they often found course material unfamiliar , complex , and nonintuitive . In addition , participants reported that the content of the HRCs was cumulative . To progress , participants often needed to grasp and understand the content in sequential order . The way HRCs were organized affected the learning experience of participants . In addition , technology hurdles surfaced for many participants throughout their HRC experience . The nature and extent of the problems varied . Academic challenge emerged as a structural theme defined by four areas in participants ' experience : unrealistic expectations , academic content , course organization , and technology frustrations . <p> Unrealistic expectations . The participants ' unrealistic expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many participants believed it would be easy to understand course content and navigate the online environment . For example , Alyson was very direct about her unrealistic expectations : " Honestly , I did n't know how difficult it was going to be . " David made a similar observation when he said , " I did n't know that the HRC was going to be so tough for me ... I did n't have a clue ... I did n't really know what I was getting into . " Participants entered the HRCs thinking , as Julie did , that the course " would be a breeze . " Instead they found that the classes were far more complex and difficult than they had expected . <p> Academic content . Participants were challenged by the academic content of their HRCs , and this was evident in four respects . They struggled with new terminology , nonintuitive content , sequential content , and in some cases , a disdain for the course . As Helen expressed , " It is hard ... when you do n't understand what the words mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Without a background in the subject matter or a context in which to ground new information , some participants struggled to understand course content . The absolute , nonintuitive content also was difficult for some participants to master . Tom described this aspect of academic challenge when he said the following : <p> pre-formatted table The cumulative nature of the course content was problematic when participants did not focus on thoroughly learning the material in sequence . They were unable to complete advanced material when they did not master foundational content . Sandy , who completed two HRCs , said , " If I had n't done well at the beginning , I know I definitely would not have been able to grasp the end . " Finally , several participants entered their HRCs with a distinct disdain for the subject matter . Carly commented , " HRC and me do not get along . " Keith echoed , " HRC and me , we just do n't play nice together . " Helen was anticipating the challenge of her HRC and said , " I think that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about why she saved her HRC for last : " The HRC was the hard course ... it is my least favorite . Anything dealing with HRC ... I avoid the things I do n't know , and what I am afraid of . I just hate HRC . " The sentiments from Carly , Keith , and Helen expressed the discordant attitudes of some participants toward their HRC . The lack of interest in the content presented a barrier to their learning . <p> Course organization . For some participants , the organization of the HRCs also adversely affected their learning experiences . In some cases , HRCs that were condensed into a shortened summer-semester format advanced at a rapid pace . The condensed summer semester was especially challenging for some and simply beyond the capability of others . As David pointed out , " Do you realize you are taking a 16-week class inside of 10 weeks , and you are taking it online ? Do you know what kind of time that is going to be ? " The sequence of course content presented additional obstacles . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the subject matter when practical applications were delayed until the later portion of the course . Participants described some HRCs as beginning with a great deal of theory and little practical application . They had difficulty maintaining interest in the course when they were unable to connect the material to meaningful applications . The lack of clarity of course assignments was also noted by participants . Inaccurate directions , confusing assignments , and misinformation within some of the HRCs further complicated an already ambiguous virtual environment , adding to the academic challenge of the courses . <p> Technology frustrations . Our participants told us that a myriad of technology hurdles surfaced throughout their HRC experience . Some related to academic assignments and others to more general issues concerning software and hardware . A challenge for some was simply navigating the course management system . Participants were especially vulnerable when technology issues occurred in the beginning of the semester . Technology concerns left them feeling anxious , and this threatened their ability to keep pace with the course . These difficulties caused frustration among participants , adding to the other areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic challenge experienced by participants as they attempted to learn the academic content left them surprised by their unrealistic ideas of what to expect in the course . They were overwhelmed by the difficulty of the content , inundated and confused by aspects of the course organization , and frustrated by technology challenges . <p> Ownership On the other hand , ownership explains how some participants prized their HRCs and how they embraced the demands of the course . Although the experience of ownership was not always associated with success , it usually was , and it was less common with those students who failed or withdrew from their HRCs . Participants demonstrated their HRC ownership in two ways : a positive stance toward the HRC and the investment made in the class . The positive stance of participants was reflected as they described their motivation , commitment , independence , self-direction , and resourcefulness . Participants invested in their HRCs through preparation and a commitment of their time , effort , focus , and organizational skills . Participants ' personal stances toward their HRC , combined with their investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . <p> A positive stance toward the HRC . Participants illustrated their positive stance by explaining how their motivation , commitment , independence , self-direction , and resourcefulness enabled them to survive and in some cases thrive in their HRCs . As Kay said , " It takes a lot of motivation to take time away from your kids after not seeing them all day . " Keith described his commitment to his HRC in his statement , " I started it and I had to finish it . " The independence described through several voices propelled the self-direction and resourcefulness of HRC participants . Samantha articulated independence when she said , " I am independent by nature anyway , so it 's not a huge thing for someone to say , here is the book , you need to learn this . " Although some participants perceived working alone as a debilitating feature of the HRC ( as mentioned above in the discussion of the structure of isolation ) , others like Samantha were also motivated by this independence . <p> Our participants also articulated the need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they needed to teach themselves . Tim described his learning experience as " having to piece it all together myself . " He went on to say , " It was basically something that was all going on with me . " Sandy added that her instructor was not " linking the material very well . I remember things if I write them down . So , every chapter I would outline and then go through all of the problems . I thought that it was a lot of teaching myself . " Alyson described a similar perspective and observed the following : <p> pre-formatted table Resourcefulness also emerged as a personal quality that contributed to the positive stance of participants within their HRC experience . Geraldine shared , " one thing I learned by taking an HRC was , really , what you need to learn , if you are patient enough , you can usually find your answers on your own . " We found that those who were resourceful in finding the help they needed to solve problems independently were able to progress in the course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stance marked by motivation , commitment , independence , self-direction , and resourcefulness  --  completed their courses . Those without such personal qualities did not . <p> The investment made in the class . Personal investment , the second dimension of ownership , describes how participants allocated the resources required to meet the demands of their HRCs . Many participants were surprised by the time and effort required to complete their courses . They described how they invested the extra time , extra effort , and total focus required by the HRCs . Most participants were experienced students . They were well aware that a certain amount of time , effort , and sacrifice was required to complete any class . Some participants had online class experience , and they knew this environment often required extra resources . What came as a surprise to many , however , was that the HRCs required even more time and effort than they anticipated . With lives already filled with commitments , they had to make adjustments and reallocate personal resources to their HRCs . Tim described this part of his experience when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this needed extra effort . And I could n't even allow myself to be distracted . I just needed to attack this for a long period of time . " Alyson shared a similar observation when she stated the following : <p> pre-formatted table Participants also described how their approach to preparing , organizing , and managing their resources contributed to their HRC experience . They found that their HRCs required more time and effort than they planned to invest . To comprehend the material , participants had to " work it and work it and work it " as Alyson described and as Keith said , " repeat things , and repeat things , and repeat things . " Kay articulated how she invested her time and effort , <p> pre-formatted table The investment of extra time , effort , and focus was required to excel in the HRC experience . Participants who were able to demonstrate ownership through their personal stance and their investment in their HRC advanced in their course and completed it with a positive outcome . For some , completing the HRC meant more than added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience to realize their goals and change their lives . <p> Acquiescence Acquiescence emerged as a structure that described the subtle ways participants submitted to their HRC and slowly surrendered to their experience . The experience of acquiescence was not always associated with a student 's failure or withdrawal in the HRC , but this was usually the case . Acquiescence was seen in three ways : silent submission , compromise , and loss . <p> Silent submission . Silent submission was experienced and represented through the quiet self-acknowledgement of lost motivation , a sense of diminishing returns , lackluster commitment , and a realization that there was no going back to a time without the HRC experience . For example , David voiced how he lost motivation and commitment for the course when he said , " I honestly believe it was a much harder challenge for me to do the HRC . I found the time that I was putting into it was less enjoyable . Yes , that certainly has an effect on my motivation . " Similarly , Julie stated , " Motivation is a very big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some were not able to adjust to the independence and self-direction required to complete their HRC courses . Julie also offered , <p> pre-formatted table The retreat to acquiescence was imminent when participants ' investment in their HRC did not reap tangible rewards . This led to erosion in personal commitment to the HRC and a sense that the effort invested was not producing the desired returns . David explained this aspect of his experience when he said " It was just taking me a lot of time . That was a growing source of frustration for me because I knew the more time that I was putting into HRC , the worse my grade was getting ... the more important that time was to me to be able to put into other classes where I was strong . " <p> When participants realized that their effort was not rewarded with satisfactory learning and good grades , they began to see the experience as a losing proposition and pulled back in their effort and commitment . Whether evidenced by a lack of motivation , a sense of diminishing returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not what they bargained for and they responded by silently submitting to the requirements of the course and their experience . <p> Compromise . Compromise represents an element of acquiescence experienced by those participants who completed their HRCs but who made concessions to survive the experience , if not the course . They settled for an undesirable experience as the cost of completing a requirement or earning credit . Keith shared , " I know I like college . I like to learn . I like the classroom . I did not have a positive experience . I could tell you , yea , I learned this , I learned that . But it was n't what I like . " Geraldine , disappointed by the lack of interaction in her HRC , summed up her experience : " That is the price that you pay for the convenience of not having to go to school . " Scott 's focus on earning his degree propelled him to complete his HRC despite his disappointment in the course . He was disappointed in the lack of interaction in the class and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described this experience as " kind of lame . " He went on to say " maybe it was because I had five or six other classes . And I have way more interest in other subjects than learning HRC . " Scott compromised his standards by pursuing a class that he felt was uninspiring because he needed the course to complete his degree . The HRC was a convenient way for him to complete a degree requirement . <p> Loss . Although the encounter with acquiescence was brief for these participants , their concessions were lasting . The silent submissions and subtle compromises left some participants with a sense of loss that they expressed through feelings of defeat , shame , and resentment . As Carly described , " I got myself in deeper , where I could n't catch up . " As the withdrawal date approached , she realized it was beyond her to succeed and finish . Participants shared their shame and how withdrawal from the HRCs , in Julie 's words , was " devastating . " The challenges they experienced left them feeling humiliated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants when she said , " I was embarrassed ... when I withdrew from the HRC , I was really ashamed . " David was painfully aware of his loss and said , " I knew that I had paid for it , I knew I did n't have the money to pay for it , and I did n't want to face the failure of , oh yeah , you wimped out , you washed out . " Resentment also emerged in participant voices when the promise of access presented by the HRC was not fulfilled . Participants enrolled in their HRCs with high hopes of making progress toward their educational goals through these online opportunities . But , some lost hope when they had to withdraw . Julie stated that at the beginning of the semester , " I was excited to see the HRC there . Once I had taken it , I was like , why do they offer that online ? " When she withdrew from her HRC , her hopes of completing her degree online were shattered . David voiced his resentment about the advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I spoke to three different counselors for different things , and they all saw what I was taking and none of them were like , so let 's talk it out , you know , what have you got going on ? ... What are you thinking ? " <p> He added , " I feel resentful in that the college is just saying , give me your money ! " Some of the HRC participants escaped acquiescence through their resolve . Some participants realized they needed to accept the concessions they made as the price for the convenience of their HRCs . A few learned that they needed to make adjustments to complete other HRCs in the future . Others realized that they were not suited for online learning and indicated that in the future , they would only enroll in campus classes . <p> L : Delicate Engagement The four structural themes of isolation , academic challenge , ownership , and acquiescence framed the HRC student experience . These structures interplayed in positive and negative ways that led participants to survive or surrender to the HRC experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empowered survivors successfully completed their HRCs . They persevered through the experience of isolation and academic challenge and responded by successfully taking ownership of the courses . Compromised survivors also successfully completed the HRCs but did not respond positively to the isolation . Although they took some degree of ownership of the HRC , their experience also was characterized by acquiescence . <p> We characterized surrenderee as either reluctant or misplaced . Surrenderee did not complete their HRCs successfully . Reluctant surrenderee responded positively to their experience of isolation but were unable to meet the academic challenge posed by the HRC . They did not exhibit ownership and ultimately demonstrated their acquiescence to the experience of the HRC . Misplaced surrenderee responded negatively to both isolation and academic challenge and , in the end , only exhibited acquiescence , therefore leading us to conclude that of all four groups , these were the students who never should have enrolled in the HRC . They were truly misplaced . Table 1 illustrates the ways in which participants responded to the four structures of the phenomenon under study . <p> The subtle ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acquiescence intermingled formed a delicate engagement , the essence of their HRC experience . Delicate engagement speaks to the strength and resilience of participants who brought ownership to their experience and embraced the isolation and academic challenge of the HRCs . Delicate engagement also describes the fragility and vulnerability of those who retreated to acquiescence , unable to overcome the isolation and academic challenge of the HRCs , and ultimately surrendered to their HRC experience . In addition , delicate engagement also describes the vulnerable threads of academic and social connection that permeated the experience of HRC participants . It represents how only some were able to persevere with a lack of contact with others . For many , this void adversely affected the quality and satisfaction of their learning experience . Our participants valued interaction with fellow students and with their instructors , and without such meaningful associations , many participants expressed dissatisfaction . Connection to the HRCs was fragile , and for some the engagement was too delicate to retain their involvement . <p> L : Summary of Findings and Recommendations Online learning is rapidly expanding in community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance education delivery , and relatively little is known about the community college student experience in online courses . The literature reports high rates of student withdrawal and failure in community college online courses . This study focused on how one group of community college online students experienced their HRCs . To be sure , this research can not be generalized to a larger population of community college students . But , of course , this was not our objective in conducting a phenomenological inquiry . Instead we sought to understand if in-depth interviews with a small group of students might help illuminate an overarching experience that was shared by those who were and were not successful in completing an online HRC . Our findings indicate that for these students at one community college , a shared experience did reflect a discernable phenomenon . Insights gained from the study allowed us to offer recommendations for practice and future research . <p> Recommendations for Practice In our study , we examined the experience of HRC students who completed their courses and those who did not . By looking at both groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this shared experience for both completers and noncompleters . This was an essential feature of our study . The following are recommendations for practice and are intended to aid all students who might enroll in HRCs , that is , those who are well prepared and those who are not : <p> * Identify HRCs and develop targeted retention programs for students enrolled in them . * Provide prospective students with orientation sessions that alert them to the course expectations and the personal investment of time , effort , and focus required to complete the HRC. * Examine institutional policies and practices to ensure student services and academic support programs are prepared for a range of students enrolled in HRCs. * Provide mentoring for HRC instructors and require participation in professional development that promotes best practices in instructional design and delivery of online courses . The recommendations above are only some of the ways online opportunities for community college students can be maximized and obstacles minimized . Continued assessment of courses and services can provide community college administrators and faculty members additional strategies to enhance the student experience . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a need for additional research and we suggest inquiry along the following lines : <p> * There is a need for research examining how community colleges can mitigate the isolation experienced in HRCs while also enhancing student ownership . * There is a need for research examining online teaching strategies along with associated high and low completion rates in HRCs . Such studies could identify both effective and ineffective teaching strategies . * There is a need for research examining how student advising , learning communities , and other student learning and support strategies affect retention and positive completion in HRCs. * There remains a need for research examining the relationship between enrollment in HRCs and degree completion and successful transfer . L : Conclusion In this research we provided a forum for participants to share their perspectives of what worked for them in their HRCs and a chance for them to voice their ideas on what can be improved in HRCs . Their willingness to share their experiences provides a valuable contribution to the future of community college online learning . The importance of these student experiences was heard through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , the HRCs and other online classes were their only access to higher education . For others , these classes afforded the chance to better manage their many obligations and responsibilities . The insights gained through the voices of HRC participants offer all of us an opportunity to identify ways that might improve the quality of the online learning experience for future community college students . <p> L : Table 1 Delicate Engagement pre-formatted table L : References  --  Aljarrah , A.
