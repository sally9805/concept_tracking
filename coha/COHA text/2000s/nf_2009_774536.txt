A. Lincoln and the Promise of America // He signed his name " a. lincoln . " a visitor to abraham lincoln 's Springfield , Illinois , home at Eighth and Jackson would find " A. Lincoln " in silvered Roman characters affixed to an octagonal black plate on the front door . All through his life , people sought to complete the A-to define Lincoln , to label or libel him . Immediately after his death and continuing to the present , Americans have tried to explain the nation 's most revered president . A. Lincoln continues to fascinate us because he eludes simple definitions and final judgments . // Tall , raw boned , and with an unruly shock of black hair , his appearance could not have been more different from that of George Washington and the other founding fathers . Walt Whitman , who saw the president regularly in Washington , D.C. , wrote that Lincoln 's face was " so awful ugly it becomes beautiful . " But when Lincoln spoke , audiences forgot his appearance as they listened to his inspiring words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and words bridge time . Illinois senator Everett Dirksen said fifty years ago , " The first task of every politician is to get right with Lincoln . " At critical moments in our nation 's history , his eloquent words become contemporary . // As a young man , he won the nickname " Honest Abe " when his store in New Salem , Illinois , " winked out . " Rather than cut and run from his debts in the middle of the night , as was common on the frontier , he stayed and paid back what he called his " National Debt . " His political opponents invented a long list of denunciations , ranging from " the Black Republican " to " the original gorilla " to " the dictator . " His supporters crafted monikers of admiration : " Old Abe , " affectionately attached to him while he was still a relatively young man , and the " Rail Splitter , " to remind voters in the 1860 presidential campaign of his roots in what was then the Western frontier . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led as commander in chief called him " Father Abraham . " After his controversial decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation on New Year 's Day 1863 , grateful Americans , black and white , honored him with the title " the Great Emancipator. " // Each name became a signpost pointing to the ways Lincoln grew and changed through critical episodes in his life . Each was an attempt to define him , whether by characterization or caricature. // Yet how did Lincoln define himself ? He never kept a diary . He wrote three brief autobiographical statements , one pointedly in the third person . As the Lincolns prepared to leave for Washington in the winter of 1861 , Mary Lincoln , to protect her privacy , burned her correspondence with her husband in the alley behind their Springfield home . In an age when one did not tell all , Lincoln seldom shared his innermost feelings in public . Lincoln 's law partner , William Herndon , summed it up " He was the most shut-mouthed man that ever existed . " Yet when Lincoln spoke , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of America . // Each generation of Americans rightfully demands a new engagement with the past . Fresh questions are raised out of contemporary experiences . Does he deserve the title " the Great Emancipator " ? Was Lincoln a racist ? Did he invent , as some have charged , the authoritarian , imperial presidency ? How did Lincoln reshape the modern role of commander in chief ? How are we to understand Mary Lincoln and their marriage ? What were Lincoln 's religious beliefs ? How did he connect religion to politics ? As we peel back each layer of Lincoln 's life , these questions foster only more questions . // Actually , Lincoln did keep a journal , but he never wrote in a single record book . What I call Lincoln 's " diary " consists of hundreds of notes he composed for himself over his adult life . He recorded his ideas on scraps of paper , filing them in his top hat or his bottom desk drawer . He wrote them for his eyes only . These reflections bring into view a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was testing a wide range of ideas , puzzling out problems , constructing philosophical syllogisms , and sometimes disclosing his personal feelings . In these notes we find his evolving thoughts on slavery , his envy at the soaring career of Stephen Douglas , and the intellectual foundations of his Second Inaugural Address . // Lincoln 's moral integrity is the strong trunk from which all the branches of his life grew . His integrity has many roots-in the soil , in Shakespeare , and in the Bible . Ambition was present almost from the beginning , and he had to learn to prune this branch that it not grow out of proportion in his life . Often , when contemporary Americans try to trace an inspired idea or a shimmering truth about our national identity , again and again we find Lincoln 's initials carved on some tree-AL-for he was there before us. // Lincoln was always comfortable with ambiguity . In a private musing , he prefaced an affirmation , " I am almost ready to say this is probably true . " The lawyer in Lincoln delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , helping him appreciate the views of others , even when those opinions opposed his own . // In an alternative life , Lincoln might have enjoyed a career as an actor in the Shakespearean plays he loved . As a lawyer , he became a lead actor on the stages of the courthouses of the Eighth Judicial Circuit of central Illinois . As president , he was a skillful director of a diverse cast of characters , civilian and military , many of whom often tried to upstage him . Although his military experience was limited to a few months in the Black Hawk War of 1832 , Lincoln would become the nation 's first true commander in chief , defining and shaping that position into what it is today . // Lincoln is the president who laughs with us . His winsome personality reveals itself in his self-deprecating humor . As a young lawyer and congressman , his satire could sting and hurt political foes , but later in life he demonstrated a more gentle sense of humor that traded on his keen sense of irony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Lincoln could still laugh , but he appreciated that humor and tragedy , as portrayed in Shakespeare 's plays , are always close companions . // Recently , the question has been asked with renewed intensity : What did Lincoln really believe about slavery ? Born in Kentucky , raised in Indiana , and becoming a politician in Illinois , Lincoln answered this question differently in his developing engagement with slavery throughout his life . One of the reasons he hated slavery was because it denied the American right to rise to African-Americans . In debates with Stephen Douglas and conversations with African-American leader Frederick Douglass , Lincoln understood that in doing battle with slavery , he was wrestling with the soul of America . // Lincoln has often been portrayed as not religious , in part because he never joined a church . How to reconcile this , then , with the deep religious insights of his second inaugural address , given only weeks before his death ? Where are the missing pieces in his spiritual odyssey ? One clue is a private musing on the question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death by his young secretary , John Hay , in a bottom drawer of his desk . A second is a religious mentor in Washington who played a largely overlooked role in the story of Lincoln 's evolving religious beliefs . // Lincoln would have relished each new advance in the information revolution . Before the modern press conference , he became skilled at shaping public opinion by courting powerful newspaper editors . During the Civil War he learned how to reach a large audience through the writing of " public letters . " He understood the potential of the chattering new magnetic telegraph , which allowed him to instantly communicate with generals in the field and become a hands-on commander in chief . In the last year and a half of his life , he surprised members of his cabinet by accepting a clearly secondary role in the dedication at Gettysburg , only to deliver a mere 272 words that stirred a nation . // Even though we have no audio record of Lincoln 's words , he still speaks to us through his expressive letters and his eloquent speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristotle 's Treatise on Rhetoric , but he embodied his definition that ethos , or " integrity , " is the key to persuasion . Even when Lincoln disappears in his speeches-as he does in the Gettysburg Address , never using the word " I " - they reveal the moral center of the man . // Lincoln was conservative in temperament . As a young man he believed that the role of his generation was simply to " transmit " the values of the nation 's founders . Over time he came to believe that each generation must redefine America in relation to the problems of its time . By the end of 1862 , Lincoln would declare , " The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate for the stormy present . " In the last two and a half years of his life , Lincoln began to think in the future tense : " We must think anew , and act anew . " However one decides to define Lincoln , whatever questions one brings to his story , his life and ideas are a prism to America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continues ... ) //
