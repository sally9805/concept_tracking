Railroad companies in the United States historically have sought to develop their service territory . An important part of their focus has involved improving and expanding agricultural activities . The Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe Railway , for one , promoted hard red " Turkey " wheat on the central Great Plains , a crop that revolutionized grain production . Even minor carriers , whether the Midland Continental , Missouri &; North Arkansas , or Quannah , Acme &; Pacific , participated in some type of agricultural development work . Indeed , the never-opened Ozark Short Line in Missouri felt the need to name an agricultural development agent . The Georgia &; Florida Railroad ( G &F),; a small regional carrier ( 1906-1963 ) that briefly boasted a 501-mile " system " between Greenwood , South Carolina , and Madison , Florida , is no exception . Almost from its creation , the G &F; revved up its engines for agricultural improvements along its lines , most of them located in Georgia . The company 's most enduring triumphs , which have been nearly forgotten , occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , the G &F,; flit is remembered at all , is recalled for being in court-controlled receivership for forty-five of its fifty-seven years , a record for Class 1 carriers. ( n1 ) <p> Similar to several other regional railroads in the South , the G &F; grew out of a handful of short lines . Early in the twentieth century John Skelton Williams , a banker from Richmond , Virginia , who had played a major role in assembling the giant Seaboard Air Line SAL that linked Washington , D.C. , Tampa , Florida , and Birmingham and Montgomery , Alabama , decided that he could replicate this business triumph , albeit on a more limited scale , by taking over several carriers and connecting them in such a way as to forge a competitive north-south route . Williams and his business associates told prospective investors that " the Georgia &; Florida Railway will bisect the rich and rapidly developing territory lying between Macon , Georgia , on the west , and Savannah on the east , which , for a distance of more than 150 miles at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and conspicuous for its need of railroad facilities , although already producing a large amount of tonnage , which , with adequate means of transportation , must rapidly increase . " ( n2 ) <p> With official incorporation in 1906 , the Williams group moved rapidly to create the new railroad . The component units soon became corporate " fallen flags , " and included the thirty-mile Augusta &; Florida Railway ; seventeen-mile Atlantic &; Gulf Short Line Railroad ; fifty-mile Millen &; South-western Railroad ; fifty-six mile Douglas , Augusta &; Gulf Railway ; twelve-mile Nashville &; Sparks Railroad ; twenty-seven mile Valdosta Southern Railway ; and about thirty miles of the Ocilla &; Valdosta Railroad . Most of these properties required extensive rehabilitation , especially the Valdosta Southern and Ocilla &; Valdosta , and approximately ninety miles of connecting line would have to be installed . For profitability the G &F; needed to reach Augusta , and ultimately opted for trackage rights over a section of the former narrow-gauge Augusta Southern Railway , an affiliate of the mighty Southern Railway . Later , the G &F; bought all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tennille . During this period of expansion , the G &F; also took possession of the fifteen-mile Sparks-Western Railway , allowing entry into Moultrie , an important railroad center near Sparks , western terminus of the former Nashville &; Sparks Railroad. ( n3 ) <p> Unlike a Chicago &; North Western , Illinois Central , or Wabash that served exceptionally fertile areas , the country along the G &F; hardly ranked as the nation 's finest . Most of the lands were part of the Atlantic coastal plain where soils tended to be rather sandy and clay-like . " Barren , oppressive , starved " were words antebellum visitors used to describe the countryside . In fact , generations of Georgians considered much of what became the G &F's; heartland to have limited economic value . The great core of the sprawling Atlantic coastal plain was commonly known as the " Rolling Wiregrass Country , " a huge , egg-shaped expanse of more than ten thousand square miles . A dense forest with its southern yellow pines and thriving undergrowth of seasonal wiregrass covered much of the area. ( n4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " frontiers " in the Southeast , being sparsely populated until after the Civil War . Local residents , often described as " frontier paupers , " were involved mostly with cutting and milling lumber , providing naval stores , and raising livestock . Cotton , the staple crop of the South , was usually absent until the late nineteenth century . The region was an economic backwater , with its isolated small farms , characterized by mud-daubed log houses , crudely-constructed outbuildings , haphazard cattle lots , and small patches of corn . The wiregrass countryside was hardly a Dixie showplace. ( n5 ) <p> Following the Civil War some sustained development began , spawning population growth and town building . The timber and naval stores industries expanded , largely stimulated by the coming of railroads . Farming of the thousands of acres of cut-over lands increased , aided greatly by the application of chemical fertilizers . After 1870 production of Sea Island cotton or " long cotton " gradually became economically important in scattered sections of south Georgia . Unlike the short-staple variety , Sea Island cotton was prized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore commanded a price that was double , even triple , that received for the much more common fiber. ( n6 ) <p> Just as predecessor lines of the G &F; had relied heavily on hauling forest products , once assembled , the company continued to handle substantial car loadings of logs , finished boards , and other wood items . Similarly , turpentine and naval stores traffic remained significant . Cotton , too , became more important as farmers planted both the short- and long-staple varieties . Fortunately for residents and the gestating G &F,; the emerging twentieth century saw stronger prices for these basic commodities . In 1900 the Moultrie Observer happily declared that " cotton is up , . spirits and rosin are higher than they have been for ten years , lumber is high .. God is surely smiling on this country . " It appeared that the " Long Depression , " which extended from the Civil War until the Spanish-American War , had mercifully lifted . The new century for the wiregrass region dawned bright , just as it did for most of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their location and natural resources . Douglas , seat of Coffee County , declared itself the " Hub of the Wiregrass , " and a representative of the Chamber of Commerce urged merchants to use this slogan , especially on their business stationery. ( n7 ) <p> By the early years of the twentieth century the dominant commodities that moved over G &F; tracks were about to change . Initially the potential decline in all-important timber products attracted the most attention . After all , the region supported a vast pine forest and also commercial stands of hardwoods , but this great natural resource was finite , and persistent logging led to thousands of acres of cut-over lands . " Before long all the large tracts of timber in this county as well as those that reach over into the adjoining counties will be a thing of the past for the stately pines are now being cut , sawed into merchantable materials which are in turn made parts of the buildings of this country , some even going across the water , " the Swainsboro Forest-Blade noted in 1915 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be long before this section of the state will be minus its large tracts of timber when the turpentine and lumber interests will merge into small concerns . and the vast acres that once were so delighting to everybody will be turned into fields of waving grain and fleecy white cotton . " Residents assumed that as loggers cleared the forests , farmers would appear ; the belief existed that the plow followed the ax. ( n8 ) <p> Yet it was premature to write an obituary for commercial wood production . The work of professional foresters from the U.S. Forest Service , state forestry departments , and land-grant colleges demonstrated that timber could become an enduring cash crop . Although the G &F; was too poor to afford its own forester , in the late 1920s the railroad began to dispatch " Forestry Demonstration " trains . The G &F; continued the practice of progressive railroads to educate farmers , landowners , and other interested parties about the potential of agricultural change . Since 1900 or so these trains had become important across the nation in " dissolving rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its possibilities . " ( n9 ) <p> The G &F; " Tree Train " lacked complexities . The special usually consisted of a locomotive , baggage car , and business car , and operated on a highly publicized schedule . On the eve of the Great Depression of the 1930s the on-board exhibits were prepared mostly by a trade group , the American Forestry Association , as part of its Southern Educational Project . The Georgia Forestry Association and the Georgia College of Agriculture also participated . These displays were designed to show what was currently being done in the manufacture of wood products , and the potentialities for a timber industry based on the fast-growing loblolly pine . Specifically , these exhibits included paper of various types , rayon made from native trees , and wood-generated chemicals employed in a variety of consumer and industrial products . At station stops train personnel , which included forestry professionals and G &F; representatives , used public places to present lectures that complemented the baggage-car displays and to show films that usually emphasized forestry protection . The G &F; announced , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be utilized for the growing of forests , but did " maintain that all land which can not be used for agriculture should be used for the production of trees . " ( n10 ) <p> Although it is impossible to measure the over-all success of these efforts by the G &F; to promote commercial forestry , press reports were universally positive . When the train visited Nashville in September 1929 , Carl Wilson , Unit Director of the American Forestry Association , and W. E. French , G &F; General Industrial Agent , performed admirably . " Two experts well matched , " observed the Nashville Herald . " The interest they manifested begat interest in others and their power of description drew the attention of the people . " Apparently their presentations offered challenges . " Some of the boys were restless at first and rather boisterous and inattentive . However before Messrs . Wilson and French got through talking , they were all attention . " The newspaper added : " There is no telling what the fruitage of the seed sown in their young minds that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already the farmers are getting well interested protecting the young growing pine trees that in all probability will enhance vastly in ten or fifteen years the agricultural production of the county . " The conclusion was straightforward : " This promising industry got a big boost by the visitation of the forestry car . " In time loblolly pines became a significant part of the economy of the wiregrass region , and the railroad benefited greatly by transporting these commercially-farmed trees that were used extensively as pulpwood. ( n11 ) <p> The G &F; did not overlook the long-established production of naval stores . By the beginning of the twentieth century this land-based industry was well established in south Georgia . Although generally in a decline after World War I , naval stores contributed to the company 's bottom line . In 1921 the railroad enthusiastically backed formation of the Gum Turpentine Farmers Cooperative Association , centered in Vidalia , and provided what assistance it could to producers and marketers alike. ( n12 ) <p> After 1900 the planting of cotton in the wiregrass region increased steadily , reaching a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in 1911 and 1914 . Although the outbreak of war in Europe soon closed some markets , prices remained strong . In 1916 Georgia 's cotton crop was worth three times what it had been valued in 1900 , and prices remained good until the end of the conflict . The G &F; handled hundreds of cars of baled cotton annually , mostly destined for textile mills in the Carolinas , New England , and abroad . Cottonseed meal and cake ( seeds and hulls ) also moved in significant quantities. ( n13 ) <p> As might be expected , G &F; personnel informed the public that cotton fields were a vital part of the landscape . The railroad had its eyes on relocating experienced cotton farmers , usually tenants who lived on the worn-out Piedmont lands of Georgia and South Carolina . Not long after operations began , the G &F; took space in the main building of Augusta 's Georgia-Carolina Fair held annually in November . " The cotton exhibit of the G &F]; is especially interesting , showing different varieties of the staple on the stalk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sea Island cotton attracts the most attention from the farmers , especially the price that being double the amount received from upland cotton . Some of the Sea Island cotton stalks were 14 feet in height . " As another way to promote cotton , the G &F; for several years awarded an annual prize of one hundred dollars for the best five acres of upland cotton and one hundred dollars for the best five acres of Sea Island cotton . The rules were clear : the producer , who needed to live within six miles of the railroad , " shall furnish a statement as to the variety of seed planted , when planted , the preparation of the ground , the quantity of fertilizer used and when and how applied , the method of cultivation and kind of implements used . The Contestant shall furnish a sample of not less than ten pounds of Cotton . to be examined by the judges selected to make the awards . " A faculty member from the Eleventh District Agricultural College ( today 's South Georgia College ) at Douglas supervised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were diminishing , a crisis in cotton developed as the Mexican boll weevil nearly dethroned King Cotton . This voracious insect , which first appeared in Texas in 1894 , began to move eastward , averaging about seventy-five to one hundred miles a year . By 1913 the weevil had reached southeastern Georgia . While infestations only diminished yields of the faster growing short-staple cotton , eventually the " winged demon " completely wiped out the slower maturing Sea Island variety . Initially cotton output did not drop markedly , and apathy by farmers toward the impending disaster set in . Even though the U.S. Department of Agriculture suggested that an effective weevil control measure ( calcium arsenate dust ) had been developed , many farmers ignored the treatment . Then damage skyrocketed . In 1919 a sharp downswing in cotton harvested began , and between 1921 and 1923 yields in Georgia fell 30 to 45 percent below normal levels . Similar declines occurred throughout the cotton belt of the Southeast. ( n15 ) <p> The G &F; recognized the crisis and responded . The railroad exhorted cotton growers to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company also encouraged farmers to heed the advice offered by a recently created network of agricultural extension agents and distributed its own " Antidotes for the Boll Weevil " circulars . The G &F; made a sound observation : " Georgia is a great cotton producing State and will continue to grow a certain amount . It has been demonstrated that cotton can be successfully grown in boll weevil territory , but it is an up-hill job with increased expense and reduced output per acre , and we will have to get away from it as a single cash crop to ever become financially independent . " By the early 1920s , as conditions for cotton worsened , the road 's agricultural agents argued more strenuously for the replacement of cotton with alternative hearty and profitable crops . They believed that the boll weevil " has made the cotton planter sit up and take notice ; he the boll weevil has been the means of convincing thousands of good people already living in the South , that he can reduce them to poverty unless they change their old cotton planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making up the Nation 's Garden the G &F's; service territory . " ( n16 ) <p> In the minds of G &F; officials the best remedy for the woes confronting cotton growers was tobacco , and here the railroad played a pivotal role in turning thousands of acres from cotton to " bright " or " flue-cured " tobacco production . Already this type of leaf had grown successfully in the eastern North Carolina-Virginia border area . Even though the crop required much more work than cotton , bright-leaf tobacco became prized by the burgeoning cigarette-making industry as men gave up pipes and began to smoke cigarettes . More importantly , profit levels were attractive. ( n17 ) <p> By the mid-1920s the G &F; enthusiastically spoke of bright-leaf tobacco as the " CHAMPION CROP OF ALL . " The railroad immodestly boasted that " THE HISTORICAL RECORDS ON TOBACCO show that the GEORGIA AND FLORIDA RAILWAY was the first railroad to undertake to commercialize Bright Tobacco in the State of Georgia . " This statement may well be accurate. ( n18 ) <p> The role played by the G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . Even before the World War I era the south Georgia press regaled readers about the promotional efforts of a Southern Baptist pastor , the Reverend W. B. Smith , better known as " Preacher Smith . " In 1915 the G &F; hired Smith as its representative to encourage tobacco planting in the wiregrass region , and he turned out to be the right person for the job . A former resident of the Carolina tobacco belt , Smith had moved to Broxton , Georgia , a G &F; branch line town , and he longed to better the economic lot of his community . It would be under Smith 's tutelage that the first tobacco was successfully grown as a commercial experiment , involving four farmers on a total of twelve acres in Coffee County . Appropriately , in 1923 Smith officially became the G &F's; " Tobacco Agent . " ( n19 ) <p> Since these initial tobacco-growing efforts were profitable , the G &F; spearheaded expansion . The railroad gave growers free seeds , and in 1917 encouraged creation in Douglas of the Georgia Tobacco Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco . Later that same year a second tobacco facility opened , and similar auction-marketing outlets appeared on-line in Adel , Hazlehurst , Moultrie , Nashville , Valdosta , and Vidalia. ( n20 ) <p> Expansion in Coffee County was particularly noteworthy . In a letter to the G &F's; assistant traffic manager in 1939 , the station agent at Douglas recalled that the town 's first warehouse " contained about forty five hundred square feet of floor space and that was the only warehouse in this section . We now have six warehouses in Douglas with a combined floor space of approximately four hundred thousand square feet , exclusive of the Douglas Tobacco Company 's plant . " These warehouse owners joined the G &F; to expand production , distribute seeds , and provide growing and selling advice. ( n21 ) <p> The G &F; was not alone in promoting a promising replacement cash crop for cotton in the wiregrass region . Agricultural agents who worked for other carriers , most notably the Atlanta , Birmingham &; Atlantic ; Central of Georgia ; and SAL also trumpeted bright-leaf tobacco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates often ignored the negative impact that tobacco had on soil fertility ; the crop 's susceptibility to disease , including bluemold and Granville wilt ; and how landowners might manipulate tenant producers. ( n22 ) <p> Still , hundreds of farmers took the advice of tobacco enthusiasts . There is little evidence to support the viewpoint that Georgia farmers suffered acutely from deep-seated traditions that made change difficult . Even though the vast majority lacked much formal education and understanding of modern science , the most isolated agrarian seemingly sensed the value of growing tobacco . This cash crop proved to be ideally suited for the small family agricultural unit , which frequently totaled only forty or fifty acres and was common throughout the wiregrass region . Residents widely recognized the need for finding a way to sustain their rural life. ( n23 ) <p> Tobacco production burgeoned as revealed by statistical data . In 1917 only 440 acres of bright-leaf tobacco were cultivated in Georgia , but after two years acreage soared to 25,300 . A decade later , farmers committed 115,000 acres to the crop , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural commodities , prices fluctuated . In 1918 the average price per pound stood at 34.5 cents . It plummeted to 6.41 cents in 1931 , although New Deal-era price supports pushed the average back to the twenty cents per pound range . By 1930 tobacco-leaf tonnage , while less than that of lumber and cotton products , represented a substantial portion of the G &F's; freight business . In that year tobacco leaf exceeded 1,600 carloads , producing revenues of nearly $150,000 . Although volume fluctuated , especially during the Great Depression , the figures for 1944 revealed 22,318 tons , producing $144,272 in income , outstripping cotton , the second largest field-grown commodity , in both weight and value . Moreover , the G &F; handled about 40 percent of all tobacco in the state that moved by rail . No one denied that tobacco turned out to be enormously beneficial for the company. ( n24 ) <p> Even though by the 1930s trucks carried more tobacco as public highways steadily improved , the G &F; retained much of this business . Excellent service pleased tobacco warehousemen , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these shippers stayed with the railroad until the end . It was hardly a news flash when the Nashville editor reported in 1935 that " at Nashville they G &F]; will have a switch engine day and night , telegraph operators and every other necessary facility for the annual tobacco rush . " Tobacco needed to be moved with dispatch because market prices could change quickly. ( n25 ) <p> The G &F; remained ever-mindful of the needs of tobacco growers . In the late 1930s an outbreak of bluemold threatened to reduce yields . Fortunately , treatment of this disease was more effective and less bothersome than chemical responses to control boll weevil infestations . An inexpensive spray consisting of red copper oxide , cottonseed oil , and water ( developed in part by tobacco-disease specialists at the agricultural experiment station in Tifton ) worked effectively . With this tool at hand , the G &F,; in cooperation with agricultural extension agents and others , dispatched its " Blue Mold Control " train to inform tobacco raisers of the mold-fighting method in January 1938 . " This special is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G &F; Agricultural and Industrial Agent , " for the purpose of bringing this valuable information to the tobacco farmers of the Georgia-Florida bright leaf belt and we have arranged the schedule of stops for convenience of the farmers all of whom are invited to the nearest demonstration point , where experts will answer any and all questions to growing tobacco from the seed bed to curing barn and especially controlling Blue Mold . " Between January 17 and 21 , the three-car special , which resembled the " Tree Train , " paid calls at Adel , Douglas , Hazlehurst , Moultrie , Nashville , Statesboro , Valdosta , and Vidalia . A year later the train operated on a similar schedule. ( n26 ) <p> As tobacco production rose and the accompanying rail traffic expanded , yielding substantial revenues , the G &F; did not ignore other possibilities for agricultural diversification . The most significant new crop after tobacco that the railroad promoted was watermelons . Like tobacco , watermelons were superbly suited for the modest farming operations that dominated wiregrass agriculture . Farmers , who grew the crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressed , this " most juicy of all herbal fruits " emerged as an important cash crop in south Georgia , occupying in fact the lion 's share of truck-farming acres in the state. ( n27 ) <p> About the time Preacher Smith launched his successful efforts to stimulate bright-leaf tobacco , R. L. Armacost , G &F's; assistant industrial agent , began to urge on-line farmers to grow melons . It was Armacost who encouraged the planting of at least ten acres on each farm , and during the formative years of production aggressively sought publicity by awarding cash prices in melon competitions . Likely the best-cotton contests inspired this ploy . In 1916 , for example , the company paid twenty-five dollars for the largest melon , fifteen dollars for the second largest , and ten dollars for the next in size . The only rules were that " contestants must have ten or more acres tributary to the Georgia &; Florida Railway , " and that " not more than one prize will be allotted any individual . " Area newspapers offered coverage , with contest stories appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly a novel idea ; for some time railroads throughout the country had such contests for crops and livestock . Nevertheless , the cash awards drew welcomed attention to the watermelon culture. ( n28 ) <p> But Armacost and other G &F; personnel did much more . Farmers appreciated the railroad 's efforts to find buyers for their watermelons . Armacost worked hard to market the crop through Leonard , Crossett &; Riley Company , a large fruit and vegetable broker in Cincinnati , Ohio , " recognized by melon growers . as the best in the business . " Similarly , the railroad backed producer efforts to organize and promote marketing associations . The most successful group , headquartered in Adel , was the Southwest Georgia Watermelon Growers Association , launched in November 1920 . As with other agricultural products , the G &F; distributed a variety of " circulars " that told growers about planting , cultivation , and marketing . Special attention was paid to plant diseases , particularly stem-end rot. ( n29 ) <p> The promotional efforts paid off handsomely . As early as 1915 several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails through Augusta to northern destinations , including points on the east coast of Canada . As production increased in the wiregrass , especially to the south and west of Douglas , car loadings soared . Watermelon raisers discovered that prices were good , especially since growing conditions allowed them to ship their twenty-five to thirty pound melons to urban markets ahead of crops grown further north . At this time a carload usually gave farmers from two hundred to three hundred and fifty dollars , and occasionally reached nearly five hundred dollars. ( n30 ) <p> The G &F; did all that it could to expedite the watermelon crop , dispatching during the harvest season frequent " Watermelon Specials . " At times doubled-headed locomotives pulled long strings of boxcars loaded floor-to-ceiling with melons that shippers packed with hay straw to avoid damage in transit . When the rush was in full swing , the G &F; moved these perishable cargoes as best it could . Fortunately , though , unlike lettuce and some other truck crops , most melons had a relatively long shelf life . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger trains . In the mid-1930s Dens Kirk , the pen name of George Kirkland , Jr. , a popular columnist for the Swainsboro Forest-Blade , had these comments about the railroad 's watermelon business : <p> When the writer was a small boy , there were no Watermelon trains such as we see today , from the middle of June till the middle of July , every day in the week , Sundays as well .. On Sunday , June 24 , 1934 , the writer was on a passenger train of the Georgia &; Florida , riding for rest and recreation , Swainsboro to Hazlehurst and return . In the make-up of the passenger train , Southbound , was a long string of empty freight cars being hauled down into South Georgia to be loaded with watermelons for up-country markets . Going down we sidetracked at Alston , a station in Montgomery county , in order that a solid watermelon train of fifty-six loaded cars might not be delayed in its onward rush to Northern markets . This was on Sunday , . and in spite of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same place , in the same sort of a big hurry , a similar solid train had rushed by going also North ; and on the return trip in the afternoon of the same day , the passenger train was hauling some ten or fifteen more cars of nothing but watermelons . This is one railroad who beats all the watermelons hauled out of South Georgia by all the railroads having tracks down there .. This is a great industry and we are for it , teeth and toenail. ( n31 ) <p> As with the hauling of timber products , cotton , and tobacco , watermelons remained important to the G &F; until its corporate demise . In the spring of 1955 , for example , Philip James , the railroad 's agricultural agent , provided watermelon farmers marketing conditions , car loading tips , and production advice . " It will be to every melon grower 's advantage to remove from vines all ill shaped melons or anything that will spoil a good melon . " Yet as with other agricultural commodities , an erosion of business occurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " many watermelons were hauled out of this section by trucks during the early part of the season . " ( n32 ) <p> In its ongoing quest to bring about agricultural diversification and enhance business , the G &F; encouraged farmers to grow a variety of fruits and vegetables . The message for raising alternative crops was direct . " The losses resulting from crop damage may be reduced by the farmers themselves . By diversifying he can carry his own insurance , " the company asserted . " A single crop farmer risks the loss of his entire crop by one storm or unusual weather conditions . If he plants different crops , he is in a position if he makes a failure on one , to realize on another . When the farmer has different commodities to sell , he is in a position to nearly always make a profit on some of the commodities he produces . " ( n33 ) <p> Tomatoes , for example , attracted the attention of the G &F.; Although the territory served by the railroad did not become the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920s and later . In 1932 , for instance , company personnel arranged with the A. J. Hend Produce Company of Nashville for Berrien County agrarians to raise 235 acres of contracted tomatoes . Approximately two hundred farmers participated , and no one individual produced less than one-half acre or more than two acres of the crop . The produce firm furnished crates and conducted packing and grading , and the G &F; transported these tomatoes to out-of-state markets. ( n34 ) <p> Cucumbers also caught the attention of the G &E; After World War I cucumbers became part of commonly tended truck-farm plantings . Like some other vegetables , both a spring and fall crop could be raised . Several counties served by the G &F,; including Atkinson , Coffee , and Lowndes , experienced production increases , spurred by profitability . An average of 480 hampers of cucumbers per boxcar generated about $1,500 in income for the producer . For the G &F; cucumbers meant a good haul , receiving loaded cars from south Georgia stations destined for the North and especially Canada . In time processors appeared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , for example , began to produce dill-mixed pickles in jars and barrels , and these food stuffs often traveled over G &F; rails. ( n35 ) <p> If there is a single food product associated with a specific community served by the former G &F,; it would be the Vidalia onion . Commercial production of this popular sweet onion variety dates from only about 1940 , although a Toombs County farmer had noticed that some of his onions lacked their usual pungency nine years earlier . It was out of this discovery that the famous place-identified product emerged . Not surprisingly , G &F; representatives quickly recognized the potential of this cash crop , and by 1942 promoted cultivation and marketing . It would not be until the 1970s , however , after the G &F; disappeared , that the Vidalia sweet onion became a national sensation. ( n36 ) <p> Throughout its history the G &F; promoted additional truck crops . The Spanish peanut was an example . In May 1929 the company encouraged Emanuel County cotton growers , whose crop had been seriously damaged or destroyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is money to be made growing Spanish peanuts and there is yet plenty of time to grow them and these farmers will stand a much better chance of making money on this crop than if they will undertake to make a crop of cotton . " The railroad assisted farmers in acquiring seed and in selling the peanuts that were used for both confection and oil . Then there were more options : asparagus , beets , bell peppers , cabbage , cantaloupes , carrots , Irish ( white ) potatoes , okra , squash , strawberries , sweet corn , sweet potatoes , and turnips . " The truthful story is ,  --  The average energetic farmer should be able to come to this section and make a much greater profit by growing and raising the same products he grows on his Northern farm , " claimed W. E. French , in the mid-1920s . " Lower priced land , our two and three crop seasons , our non-freezing winters and our early marketing seasons are our greatest advantages . " In fact , the railroad repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipments exploit the best prices in northern produce markets . " ( n37 ) <p> Part of the overall strategy for agricultural diversification and enhanced profitability involved livestock , including cattle , sheep and hogs , and poultry . As the G &F; did with efforts to promote a variety of crops , particularly bright-leaf tobacco , its agricultural and development arm encouraged more and better livestock production . Special trains with appropriately equipped rolling stock , one or two baggage cars , and passenger coaches , traveled along the main line and major branches showing farmers practical aspects of beef-cattle raising , dairy farming , and sheep , goat , and swine production . Between the two world wars these " Beef Cattle Specials , " " Dairy Sire Trains , " and " Better Pork Specials " became frequent occurrences . To highlight static displays , company , college , and federal agricultural personnel offered practical demonstrations , indicating how , for example , feed grinding machines might create " great savings " for livestock raisers . Seizing upon the technology of motion pictures , the company utilized films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &F; did not always operate its livestock demonstration specials independently . When the company worked with public officials , the railroad often handled a train that traveled over the rails of several carriers . Since extension personnel wished to use these co-operative movements , the G &F; agreed . In 1937 , for instance , the G &Fjoined; with the Atlantic Coast Line to send a livestock-raising train across large sections of Georgia. ( n39 ) <p> The railroad also expressed interest in the dairy industry . As early as 1909 John Skelton Williams told his business associate , Col. J. M. Wilkinson of Valdosta , that it had " always impressed me as being wrong that we should have to bring nearly all of the butter used in our towns in south Georgia from a distance . " So he asked the colonel , " Do you not think it would be a good idea to try to start a first-class , up-to-date creamery in the vicinity of Valdosta to show what can be done ? " Although this creamery proposal came to naught , in the 1920s G &F; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of public meetings to inform farmers about the benefits for such endeavors . Their work paid dividends . In 1930 the railroad reported that " as result of our efforts a cheese plant and creamery has been established at Greenwood , SC . , and now a thriving creamery has . been established at Douglas , Ga. , through our activities . " ( n40 ) <p> The G &F; and competing railroads likewise adopted a similar approach with poultry culture . In 1929 the company dispatched a highly publicized " Poultry Demonstration Car Train " over the main line . Working with federal and state agricultural authorities , experts explained displays and showed interested observers how to manage large flocks of chickens , both for eggs and meat . There was also a strong economic message : " We have said that the dairy business is the easiest and quickest business for a farmer to get started in . He can buy a cow today , feed her tonight and carry his cream to market tomorrow . The poultry business is a similar business . You can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and have one thousand hens laying early in the spring . If the cotton crop fails , you can start in the chicken business after you get through with the cotton and begin marketing your poultry crop before time to plant cotton again . " ( n41 ) <p> Some farmers accepted this G &F; perspective . By the late 1920s chicken production throughout the wiregrass region increased , and railroad officials took heart . The company encouraged farmers to fatten broilers and arrange with their local depot agents for special poultry cars to transport the birds to northern destinations . By way of example , in June 1928 the railroad received several poultry cars at Vidalia billed to New York City . The attention paid to the poultry reaped direct traffic benefits . Still , the percentage of revenue freight for all types of " products of animals " was never great , and in the several years before the Great Depression represented only about one percent. ( n42 ) <p> Commitment by the G &F; to the agricultural well being of its service territory never flagged . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in later years it took a keen interest in promoting irrigation projects . In the early 1950s a severe drought ravaged the Southeast , the worst in recorded history for south Georgia . Initially , the G &F; responded to appeals from local American Farm Bureau Federation organizations with a Band-Aid solution : namely , during the fall of 1954 the company transported water from the Augusta area to the hardest hit communities . Daily for several weeks the road supplied five 10,000-gallon tank cars at its own expense , providing this precious fluid to farmers for their most-pressing livestock needs . When the train crew spotted the tank car ( or cars ) , a section man assisted recipients with loading water into their containers : barrels , drums , and tanks . " The railroad 's efforts were very much appreciated by the people , " remembered a former G &F; employee. ( n43 ) <p> But the G &F; realized that farmers required more than tank cars of water . Since every locale experienced periods of wet and dry weather , the company thought that a long-term practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , the following year the railroad dispatched what became commonly known as the " Irrigation Train . " President J. Pete Belvin worked with the road 's agricultural agent to develop this special , and in the summer of 1955 the train made ten stops during a weeklong trip . Belvin knew about such movements since his days as an agricultural agent ; moreover , " he loved these demonstration trains and knew how to entertain . " The railroad received assistance from the University of Georgia , Southeastern Sprinkler Irrigation Association , and several banks and agri-business concerns . A diesel locomotive pulled two flat cars for displays and to serve as a speaker 's platform . There was also a tank car to supply water for the demonstration of a portable aluminum sprinkler system supplied by the Aluminum Company of America . The on-board equipment allowed farmers , mostly tobacco producers , to see the various types of equipment in operation , and businessmen explained purchase and finance arrangements . In some ways this was an historic happening . The Irrigation Train was " one of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian Roy Scott . By this time railroads had mostly left the agricultural development fields , allowing public and private groups to assume these activities and to employ new approaches and technologies. ( n44 ) <p> Even if the G &F; lacked cutting-edge thinking about enhancing agriculture , the company made a sincere effort to bring about improvements . Employees , though , would never deny that self-interest was involved . After all , the G &F; had long encountered financial difficulties before its eventual sale to the Southern Railway in 1963 , and always needed to bolster income . Importantly , there was no indication that individuals , groups , or communities ever objected to what the G &F; did or sought to do . Unlike the controversial book , Bad Land , in which Jonathan Raban argued that the promotional and agricultural-development work conducted early in the twentieth century by the Chicago , Milwaukee &; St. Paul Railroad in eastern Montana conned thousands of settlers into believing that could transform a semi-arid environment into lush farmland , the G &F; can hardly be accused of any misdeeds .
