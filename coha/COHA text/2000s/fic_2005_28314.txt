1 Jonathan Green came to my office on a hazy June morning with an entourage of three attorneys , a videographer , and an intense young woman lugging eight hundred pounds of sound recording equipment . The videographer shoved past the attorneys and swung his camera around my office , saying , " This is just what we need , Jonathan ! It 's real , it 's colorful , it 's L.A. ! " He aimed his camera at me past the Mickey Mouse phone and began taping . " Pretend I 'm not here . " I frowned at him , and he waved toward the lawyers . " Do n't look at me . At them . Look at them . " I looked at them . " What is this ? " I was expecting Green and an attorney named Elliot Truly , but not the others . Truly had arranged the meeting . A man in his mid-forties wearing an immaculately tailored blue Armani suit said , " Mr. Cole ? I 'm Elliot Truly . This is Jonathan Green . Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then Green . Green looked exactly the way he had the two times I 'd seen him on 60 Minutes , once when he defended an abortion rights activist accused of murder in Texas and once when he defended a wealthy textile manufacturer accused of murder in Iowa . The Texas case was popular and the Iowa case was n't , but both were victories for the defense . The videographer scrambled backward across the office to fit us into his frame , the woman with the sound gear hustling to stay behind the camera as they captured the moment of our first meeting . Armstrong steps onto the moon ; the Arabs and the Israelis sign a peace accord ; Jonathan Green meets the private detective . The woman with the sound equipment bumped into my desk and the videographer slammed against the file cabinet . The littlefigures of Jiminy Cricket on the cabinet fell over and the framed photo of Lucy Chenier tottered . I frowned at him again . " Be careful . " The videographer waved some more . " Do n't look at me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " If you break anything , I 'll ruin more than the shot . " Green seemed embarrassed . " This is tiresome , Elliot . We have business here , and I 'm afraid we 're making a bad impression on Mr. Cole . " Truly touched my arm , trying to mitigate the bad impression . " They 're from Inside News . They 're doing a six-part documentary on Jonathan 's involvement in the case . " The woman with the sound equipment nodded . " The inner workings of the Big Green Defense Machine . " I said , " Big Green Defense Machine ? " The videographer stopped taping and looked me up and down as if he found me lacking but was n't quite sure how . Then it hit him . " Do n't you have a gun ? " He glanced around the office as if there might be one hanging on a wall hook . " A gun ? " He looked at Truly . " He should be wearing a gun . One of those things under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furry arms . Truly frowned . " A shoulder holster ? " The woman nodded . " A hat would be nice . Hats are romantic . " I said , " Truly . " Jonathan Green 's face clouded . " I apologize , Mr. Cole . They 've been with us for the past week and it 's becoming offensive . If it bothers you , I 'll ask them to leave . " The videographer grew frantic . " Hey , forget the gun . I was just trying to make it a little more entertaining , that 's all . " He crouched beside the watercooler and lifted his camera . " You wo n't even know we 're here . I promise . " Truly pursed his lips at me . My call . I made a little shrug . " The people who come to me usually do n't want a record of what we discuss . " Jonathan Green chuckled . " It may come to that , but let 's hope not . " He went to the French doors that open onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy Chenier . " Very pretty . Your wife ? " " A friend . " He nodded , approving . When he nodded , the two lesser attorneys nodded , too . No one had bothered to introduce them , but they did n't seem to mind . Jonathan Green sat in one of the leather director 's chairs across from my desk and the two lesser attorneys went to the couch . Truly stayed on his feet . The videographer noticed the Pinocchio clock on the wall , then hustled around to the opposite side of my desk so that he could get both me and the clock in the frame . The Pinocchio clock has eyes that move side to side as it tocks . Photogenic . Like Green . Jonathan Green had a firm handshake , clear eyes , and a jawline not dissimilar to Dudley Do-Right 's . He was in his early sixties , with graying hair , a beach-club tan , and a voice that was rich and comforting . A minister 's voice . He was n't a handsome man , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease . Jonathan Green was reputed to be one of the top five criminal defense attorneys in America , with a success rate in high-profile criminal defense cases of one hundred percent . Like Elliot Truly , Jonathan Green was wearing an impeccably tailored blue Armani suit . So were the lesser attorneys . Maybe they got a bulk discount . I was wearing impeccably tailored black Gap jeans , a linen aloha shirt , and white Reebok sneakers . Green said , " Did Elliot explain why we wanted to see you ? " " You represent Theodore Martin . You need investigators to help in the defense effort . " Theodore " Teddy " Martin had been arrested for Susan Martin 's murder and was awaiting trial . He had gone through two prior defense attorneys , had n't been happy with them , and had recently hired Jonathan Green . All the hirings and firings had been covered big time by the local media . Green nodded . " That 's right . Mr. Cole , I 've spoken at length with Teddy and I believe that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I smiled . " Moi ? " The videographer edged in closer . I raised a finger at him . Unh-unh-unnh . He edged back . Truly said , " We 've talked to people , Mr. Cole . You 've an outstanding reputation for diligence , and your integrity is above reproach . " " How about that . " I glanced at the camera and wiggled my eyebrows . The videographer frowned and lowered the lens . Jonathan Green leaned toward me , all business . " What do you know about the case ? " " I know what everybody knows . I watch the news . " You could n't read the Times or watch local television without knowing the business about James X and the five hundred thousand dollars and the dumpster . I 'd heard Theodore Martin 's sound-bite version of it ten thousand times , but I 'd also heard the DA 's sound-bite version , too , that Teddy and Susan were n't getting along , that Susan had secretly consulted a divorce attorney and told a friend that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep her from walking away with half of his estimated **33;207;TOOLONG fortune . I said , " From what I hear , the police have a pretty good case . " " They believe they have , yes . But I do n't think all the facts are in . " Green smiled and laced his fingers across a knee . It was a warm smile , tired and knowing . " Did you know that Teddy and Susan loved to cook ? " I shook my head . That one had slipped right by me . " Teddy arrived home early that night , and they had no engagements , so the two of them decided to cook something elaborate and fun . They spent the next couple of hours making a pepper-roasted pork tenderloin with wild cherry sauce . Teddy makes the sauce with fresh cherries , only they did n't have any , so he ran out to get some . " Truly took a step toward me and ticked points off his fingers . " We have the receipt and the cashier whom Teddy paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Green spread his hands . " And then there 's the question of the money . What happened to the money ? " Truly ticked more fingers . " We have the bank transactions and the business manager . The manager says that Teddy was visibly shaken when he came for the money that Friday morning . He says Teddy was white as a sheet and his hands were shaking . " Green nodded . " Yet the cashier remembers that Teddy was relaxed and happy a dozen hours earlier . " Green stood and went back to the balcony . The videographer followed him . At the French doors he turned back to me and spread his hands again . I wondered if he thought he was in court . " And then we have the murder weapon and the crime scene evidence . " Truly ticked more fingers . He had used up one hand and was starting on the next . " There were fingerprints on the hammer , but none of them match Teddy . There were also fingerprints on the garbage bags that Susan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I said , " You think he 's innocent because of that ? " Green came back to the director 's chair , but this time he did n't sit . He stood behind it , resting his hands on the wooden posts that hold the back . " Mr. Cole , I do n't win the number of cases that I do because I 'm good . I turn down ten cases every day , cases that would bill millions of dollars , because I will not represent people I believe to be guilty . " The videographer went down to the floor for a low-angle shot , the woman with the sound equipment with him , and I heard him mumble , " Oh , man , this is great . " Green said , " I do n't represent drug dealers or child molesters . I only take cases that I believe in , so that every time I walk into court I have the moral high ground . " I leaned back and put my foot on the edge of my desk . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , I do . " He came around to the front of the chair and tapped his chest . " In here I know he 's innocent . " The videographer muttered , " This is fabulous , " and scrambled around to keep Jonathan Green in the shot . Green sat and leaned toward me , elbows on knees . " I do n't yet know all the facts . I need people like you to help me with that . But I do know that we 've received several calls that are disturbing . " Elliot Truly said , " Have you heard of our tip line ? " " I 've seen the ads . " Green 's office was running television , radio , and print ads offering a reward of one hundred thousand dollars for anything leading to the capture , arrest , and conviction of James X. There was a number you could call . Green said , " We 've received over twenty-six hundred calls and there are more every day . We try to weed out the cranks as quickly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared my throat and tried to look professional . " Okay . You need help running these things down . " Green raised his eyebrows . " Yes , but there 's more to it than that . Several of the callers have indicated that one of the arresting officers has a history of fabricating cases . "
