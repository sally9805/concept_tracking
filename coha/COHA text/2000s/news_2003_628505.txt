<p> FORT LAUDERDALE , Fla. - San Antonio Spurs guard Steve Smith has been working this assembly line for 12 years , dating to his selection in the 1991 NBA Draft by the Heat . <p> He is a union man , one with a job to protect . He also is subtly being nudged out of his occupation by younger , cheaper labor , with no certainty for future basketball employment . <p> Should the league adopt an age requirement for future drafts , such as the 20-year-old minimum that could go into effect as soon as next year , the 34-year-old shooting specialist could squeeze a few more seasons out of his career . <p> Still , like many in the league , he remains opposed to what some perceive as the moral imperative of Commissioner David Stern . <p> " It would be unfair , " Smith said . " In other professional sports , people start so young . Some guys are ready , some guys are not . But how can we determine which guys are ready , physically and with maturity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Smith speaks in the San Antonio locker room at SBC Center , point guard Tony Parker sits to his left , as one of the prime reasons the Spurs are in the Western Conference semifinals against the Lakers . <p> Drafted two years ago at 19 , Parker is the type of prospect the league is considering legislating into professional purgatory - good enough , but not old enough , to make it in the NBA . <p> " I mean , look at Tony , " Smith said of a player who has pushed him to the end of the San Antonio bench . " He 's very mature . How can you put your finger on he 's mature , he 's not mature ? I do n't think that 's for us , I think that 's for the team scouting them . It has to be on them whether a player is ready . " <p> With that , Smith turns to a more timely subject . <p> " Should LeBron James go to college ? " he asks . " Right now you would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play well , everybody would say , ' He should have went to college . ' You ca n't measure that . " <p> Based on the past few weeks , you 'd almost assume the plan would be to go the other way , to cap eligibility for the NBA Draft at 20 . <p> The first round of the playoffs was dominated by Tracy McGrady , Kevin Garnett , Kobe Bryant . During that same time , Jermaine O'Neal was named to the U.S. Olympic team and Amare Stoudemire was selected Rookie of the Year . <p> All arrived to the NBA as teens . All have thrived . <p> The issue of a minimum age is no slam dunk , with Monday 's early-entry deadline for the June 26 draft not necessarily the final one to provide access to teenagers . <p> " I ca n't even handicap it for you right now , " Stern said on the eve of the playoffs . " My own guess would be that any changes we make , any deals we make with our players association , would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it might be at the end of the 2003-04 season . And it might not be done at all . I do n't really have the strong prognostication on that issue . " <p> Similarly , union executive director Billy Hunter sat courtside at a game and acknowledged it is an issue that at least deserves deliberation . <p> " I 'm up for admitting that there are times when I wonder whether my position is wrong , " he said of his staunch opposition to a limitation other than the current prohibition on domestic players applying before their high school class graduates or foreign players before the year of their 18th birthday . <p> " But if everyone else is exploiting them , I have to ask why : Why should n't they seize the opportunity themselves ? It 's ridiculous to say a kid should n't come here and make money . " <p> To some , it comes down to whether the issue is one that should be collectively bargained or debated on moral grounds . <p> " People make a little too big of a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's not like there 's 20 high school guys a year coming out . It 's very , very few . And even now , it 's only guys who are physically ready . It 's Amare Stoudemire , who 's already physically a man , LeBron James . " <p> Van Gundy , who coached at the University of Wisconsin and comes from a family of college coaches , does not oversell the college experience . Even those young players who have languished on NBA benches , he maintains , have benefited . <p> " I think it helped Jermaine O'Neal and guys like that to be in the NBA earlier , playing against better competition , playing against NBA competition every day in practice , " he said . " And we 're able to spend more time with those guys , working . The only benefit in college to some of those guys is maturity-wise , but not playing-wise . I think that 's not a good argument . " <p> Forward LaPhonso Ellis , the Heat 's union representative , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-year contributor at Notre Dame , Ellis did not enter the NBA until he was 22 . He said for as far as Bryant , Garnett and McGrady have come , time on campus would not necessarily have stunted their growth . <p> " Because they 're talented , you would assume they would have gone to the best NCAA programs , " he said . " And if you 're playing for Mike Krzyzewski , even one year under him is going to be a benefit for you . One year under Bobby Knight , one year under any of those great coaches I can name , is going to be a benefit . " <p> Syracuse forward Carmelo Anthony certainly was an example of that , grabbing a championship ring and a wealth of pressure-packed experience in his one-and-out experience this season under Jim Boeheim . <p> Similar pit stops well could have provided smoother transitions for the likes of Wizards forward Kwame Brown and Bulls big men Eddy Curry and Tyson Chandler , players seemingly rocked by their preps-to-pros fast-tracking in 2001 . <p> Among the prime arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater good . Having guided youthful rosters while coach of the Magic and Grizzlies , Brian Hill comes down on that side of the equation . <p> " I think the 20-year-old rule is a good rule , because for every Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant and LeBron James , although he has n't done it yet in the NBA , there are five or six thousand other kids at 18 years of age who are going to think they 're ready to come out for the NBA , and they 're not ready , " Hill said . " Rather than tempt these young kids to come out after high school , with the lure of fame and fortune and everything else , I think the idea of a limit is good . <p> " Even T-Mac , if you look at him , his career did n't really take off until after three years in the NBA , in Toronto . And Kobe was n't an immediate starter coming into the NBA . I do n't think ( college ) could have hurt them , it only could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the money they would have made in those years . I do n't know how you make that up . But , again , I think you 're talking about the exception rather than the rule . " <p> Actually , the rookie salary cap , has conspired to push prospects into early entry . For up to five years , a team can control a first-round pick 's pay . <p> <p> Notable early NBA draft entries <p> Carmelo Anthony , Fr. , F , Syracuse . <p> Mario Austin , Jr. , F , Mississippi State . <p> Ronald Blackshear , Jr. , G Marshall <p> Carl English , G , Jr. , Hawaii <p> T.J.
