BLUE MOUNTAINS * WA Headnote THE BEST MOUNTAINS NOBODY KNOWS // IN THE UPPER LEFT corner of the country , the soggy Olympic Mountains are famous for their old-growth rainforests . The Cascades are celebrated for their craggy summits and volcanic peaks . The Rockies form a world-famous border between the Northwest and Mountain West . Even the jagged Wallowa Mountains are well known . But mention the Blue Mountains to a backpacker from Seattle , Spokane , or Portland , and you 'll almost certainly get a blank stare , because the Blues are the Pacific Northwest 's unknown range . Ranging in elevation from 1,600 to 6,500 feet , these mountains rise out of the plains of southeastern Washington , their southern edge spilling over into Oregon to form a gentle rampart just west of Idaho 's Hells Canyon . Blanketed by forests of dark-green pine and spruce , the Blues boast superb scenery and empty campsites just 5 hours from the region 's major metropolises . Having hiked all the great Northwestern ranges , I 'm nevertheless drawn back to these remote mountains , primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Slick Ear Trail , I saw great gaggles of wild turkeys dodging and sprinting through the pine forests . I saw mule deer as big as elk , and plenty of elk to help me make the comparison . After reaching the Wenaha River Trail , which heads down into Oregon , I watched small herds of bighorn sheep tiptoe across sun  --  drenched rimrock bluffs high above the river . In the evening , I pulled plump rainbow and brown trout from the gin-clear waters of the Wenaha , but released them quickly ; fresh scat and tree scrapes suggested black bears were in the area . Indeed , I soon spied a cinnamon-colored bear , its colorful coat reminding me that not all black bears are black ( reddish-brown is common here ) . THE BLUES ARE A SMALL , young range dominated by deep river valleys and modest peaks . The Umatilla National Forest encompasses much of the range , with the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness Area protecting the heart of the back  --  country . Scores of trails bisect the Wenaha-Tucannon ( named for the pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but the Wenaha River Trail is my favorite . During a recent mid  --  summer visit , I hiked through old-growth pine forest along the upper portion of the Grizzly Bear Trail , listening to the resonant " whomp , whomp , whomp " of nervous spruce grouse . Dropping to the valley bottom , I walked through lodgepole and fir forests that opened into airy ponderosa pine groves littered with broad , open meadows-perfect country for wildlife spotting . Come late afternoon , I pitched camp in one of the countless quiet sites lining the Wenaha , and waited for darkness and the mournful cries of resident coyotes . In decades of hiking here , I 've rarely encountered more than one or two parties of hikers or horsepackers in these camps . The only two-legged beasts I saw during my last outing were turkeys , by the hundreds . Add the steady stream of four-legged travelers-deer , elk , bighorn , and black bears-and you 'll understand why even a solo hiker will never get lonesome in the isolated Blues .
