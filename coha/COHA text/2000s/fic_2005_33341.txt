Chapter One Extreme Sweets The dog wakes up from a dream at the same time I do . His whimpering wakes me , so I pet his nose to calm him . We were both dreaming about cats . I dreamed that my cat had six kittens , each one a color of the rainbow . The purple one was pastel , the same lavender as the Horse of a Different Color in The Wizard of Oz movie . I looked down to see if I was wearing ruby slippers , but I was n't . My dog was dreaming of eating cat food . Most of his dreams are about stealing food from other animals . When his paws twitch , that means in his dream he just grabbed some meat and is trying to outrun a pack of vicious , hungry dogs . One time , when he and I were having the same dream , the dogs were faster than him , and I watched them catch up and rip him apart . I woke up crying . I wonder where you go when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you die in your dreams , night after night . Are you dying a little each time ? Your whole life , you 're dying , but I try not to think of it that way . My cousin Laura collects glass animals . She dusts them like forty times per day . When I go over to her house , she constantly glances over to her armoire , making sure her animals are safe . " What 's new ? " I ask her . " Nothing , " she says . " Like a soda ? " I ask , tossing her a can . " Thanks , " she says , setting it on the table . " Want to go to the beach ? " I ask . " Ca n't , " she says . " I 'll burn . " " Use sunscreen , " I say . " Maybe we 'll see dolphins . " She walks over to her shelves and picks up her dolphin . She steams it up with her breath , and polishes it with a diaper cloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , " I say . " Do n't be so melodramatic . " " You 're melodramatic , coming over here , all beached up and ready to party . " " What ? " I say . " FYI , I 'm trying to cheer you up and get you into the sun . " " I get plenty of light , " Laura says . " I got these natural lightbulbs on eBay ... " " Fuck eBay , " I say , then storm out . I really do n't know what 's wrong with Laura . She buys and sells animal figurines on eBay so she does n't have to leave her house . We did n't grow up together . But she 's one of my only relatives . Her mom and my mom are enemies . Laura and I are the same age . She has long brown hair , nice skin and teeth , and she keeps her nails painted . Sometimes when I go over to her house she 's in this white gauze gown that looks like it 's from Victorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm grubbier , I shave my head , wear cutoffs , and I keep my nails short so they do n't get too much dirt under them . Riding my bike rules my life . I ride my bike around , racing past bums who push shopping carts and ladies who wheel sacks of laundry to the laundromat . Yesterday I saw a lady balancing a box of mangos on her head . My mom and her sister are enemies because my mom found out that my aunt knew my dad was sick before he died , but she did n't tell anyone . Dad died ten years ago . My mom feels my aunt was partially responsible for my father 's death , and my aunt swears that he made her promise not to tell anyone , because he knew he was sick and he would 've died anyway . He did n't want everybody worrying about him . But my mom says that does n't matter , when a man is dying and he does n't want his wife and kids to know , you tell them anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but right after he died I 'd lie awake trying to convince myself that my aunt was n't a murderer . She did n't stab him or shoot him , but she secretly knew he was dying and did n't do a thing to change it . That 's pretty close to murder . * * * In the middle of the night , my dog and I share candy on the couch . He sits next to me with his paws crossed , staring at my bag of taffy . He 's like , I 'll eat it all even if I have to barf it up after . He 's like , Go For It . He likes the lime ones ; lime is my least favorite . He freaks on sweets . I know it 's bad to feed him donuts and Jujubes , but I ca n't resist . He lives for this . It makes me feel like we 're both living our dreams . Sporty , like Extreme Dreaming ! I imagine myself being interviewed on network television : " I 'm just doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a difference . " Full of slogans , holding my Bit-O-Honey . It 's like , you have dreams , night after night , for years on end , they do n't make any sense , you wake up , and fuck it-you give your dog a little candy to cheer yourself up . Is that so bad ? I mean , is it ? I could be thinking of ways to sabotage my will-o ' - the- wisp cousin , but no . I just eat candy . The night after the lavender cat , Laura and I are riding through the sky in a glass elevator , a modern one , not like Willie Wonka 's . All four sides of this elevator are made of windows that you can roll down , and the strangers riding with us are hanging out , smoking cigarettes over the edges . I think of what Charlie says in the book-It 's eerie and frightening to be standing on clear glass high up in the sky . It makes you feel that you are n't standing on anything at all . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . It would have been just as surprising to see a hammerhead shark swim past as it is to see this red-tailed hawk flying below the smokers . Things speeding by , like in the tornado before Oz-a cow , a witch on a bike , trees with roots hanging down . Instead though , a hawk and cigarette butts . Laura shouts , " Come stand on the edge . " " Why do n't you stand on the edge ? " Laura lights up , and the smoke wafts into my face . " Blow it out the window , " I tell her . As if there are n't windows all around us . She leans over and whispers , " You know , you could die up here and I would n't tell anyone . " She gets ready to push me over . I wake up knowing that if I stayed asleep , I would 've died . Basically , I just saved my own life . Ha ! I think , in the darkness . You ca n't kill me ! This applies less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I roll out of bed and into the kitchen , where I pour myself a glass of chocolate milk and drink it in the light of the fridge . It 's the ultimate chocolate milk commercial-Narrowly escaping death , she reaches for the only thing that can satisfy , Milk ! Next day I go to Disneyland . I feel guilty for leaving the dog home alone all day . " I 'll bring you a treat , " I tell him , as I pet his head and pull the front door shut . " He 'll be fine , " my friend Lois says , putting her sunglasses on . She 's an optimist . " Once you ride Space Mountain you 'll forget all about him . " " That 's true , " I say , wondering what Laura 's doing . I decided yesterday to stop inviting her out , which also contributes to my guilt . I know from past experience how much it sucks to feel guilty at Disneyland . You 're twirling in a teacup at sunset remembering you told your mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ride and find a pay phone to call and apologize , but you did n't bring her phone number with you . Harsh . The Haunted House reminds me of Laura , the painting of the beautiful young girl that morphs into an old hag with snakes in her hair . " That looks like my cousin , " I say to Lois . " Or you , " she jokes . " Shut up , " I say , elbowing her . Still , it 's uncanny . " It 's a ride , not a funeral , " Lois says . I remember the glass elevator . " Do n't you love Willie Wonka ? " I ask Lois . " We 're at Disneyland , " Lois says . " Wrong fantasy . " " Let 's get candy , " I say . When we exit the mansion , we head straight for the stand where I chomp on chocolate turtles and candy canes . I buy a Mickey Mouse Pixy Stix for the dog , after I picture his nose dusted with the sugar powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she chews gumdrops . All I can think about is death . Laura , I 'm convinced , is trying to kill me with her mind . " I think my cousin 's psychic , " I say . " What ? " Lois says . " Last night , in my dream , Laura was trying to kill me , " I explain . " She sits at home all day , tripping out on eBay ... I feel like right now she 's sending me evil vibes . " " No more candy for you , " Lois says . " Anyways , you ca n't die from dreaming about death . " " But she could be willing my demise , " I say . " Voodoo . " " Look , Laura might shop too much on eBay , but that does n't make her a Voodoo priestess , " Lois says . " That 's , like , from a bad horror movie . " " We 'll see , " I say . " I better start sleeping with Snickers under my pillow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocked . " " There 's plenty of candy in heaven , " Lois says . Lois was right : I did eat too much candy at Disneyland . That night my dreams were a mess . I breast-fed a hippo . An albino man with glass teeth stalked me ; every time I turned around he was Windexing his grin . My dog spoke backwards , telling me that he needed to be brushed . Hsurb em , he said . What 's worse , the glass-toothed man finally cornered me at a party , bit my arm with his jagged fangs , and I bled to death while everyone stood around drinking beer . But Laura was n't responsible . She had her chance to get in there and damage me , while I was trapped in my sugary nightmares , but instead she stayed up all night haggling , pale-faced in her computer screen 's glow .
