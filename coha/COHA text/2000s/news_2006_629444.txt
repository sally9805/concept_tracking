<p> In his 12 years as a criminal law attorney , Eric J. Davis has had many courtroom successes , but none compares to his latest victory - getting an innocent man out of prison . <p> The Houston attorney became the center of national headlines last month when his client , Arthur Mumphrey , gained his freedom after spending 18 years in prison on a sexual assault conviction . <p> DNA evidence recovered with Davis ' persistence and new testing not available when the crime occurred in February 1986 cleared Mumphrey as one of two attackers of a 13-year-old girl . <p> Those who know Davis or have worked with him say it comes as no surprise that he prevailed in the challenging case . He 's a man who believes in defending people 's rights and who will search under every stone when trying a case , they said . <p> Fellow attorneys see him as a shining star in the legal arena , destined to become a judge someday . His clients often speak of him as the attorney who cares about those he represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes the compliments in stride .

Our government is based on people who asked questions and questioned authority . Part of my job is not to go with the status quo . " <p> A licensed attorney since 1994 , Davis , 36 , says he has tried about 70 cases as both a former prosecutor and a private attorney . <p> Some of his notable victories include : <p> A federal religious discrimination suit against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in 2002 . The jury awarded his client , a prison employee and Jehovah 's Witness , $500,000 in damages plus $44,000 in attorney fees . The employee claimed she suffered retaliation after she complained about a warden requiring employees to pray with him during monthly meetings . <p> A 2004 criminal case in which a prison guard faced two cases of sexual assault against two inmates . The jury found the prison guard not guilty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA evidence and the testimony of the two alleged victims . <p> And a case that resulted in the removal of Port Arthur Justice of the Peace Thurman Bartie from office , barring him from ever holding a judicial office in Texas . The case was heard before a Review Tribunal in April 2004 . <p> Seana Willing , executive director of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct , recalls how impressed she was with Davis , who served as a special counsel for the commission on the Bartie case . The commission had recommended Bartie 's removal because he used obscene language in the courtroom , failed to follow the law and used corporal punishment in a truancy matter . <p> He 's not a big-name attorney , but he should be , " Willing said of Davis . You could tell he just had the right stuff as far as his skill , his professionalism and manner in dealing with people . ...

He 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bill Torrey , who worked as a staff attorney for the commission at the time of the Bartie case , recommended Davis for the pro bono assignment . He had worked with Davis two years earlier on a drug case in Victoria . He said he admired his integrity and intensity in the courtroom . <p> " He 's very laid-back , but in the courtroom he shifts into overdrive and you can feel it , " Torrey said . You can see the street fighter in him . " <p> On Bartie 's appeal , Davis was so effective that the group of appellate judges returned a unanimous affirmation in two hours , Torrey said . <p> I 've never heard of that in my life . It usually takes a month , " said Torrey , who has practiced law for 29 years and is now in private practice . <p> Davis , the youngest of three children , grew up in New Orleans ' lower 9th Ward , an area ravaged by Hurricane Katrina .

He described Davis as confident , even as a novice . He said he recalls Davis being reasonable and fair in his recommendations and plea bargains . <p> Alexander , now a trial lawyer in Jacksonville , said he 'd be surprised if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never railroaded anybody , " he said . <p> Knack for negotiating <p> Looking back , childhood friend Sheldon Jones said Davis always had a knack for negotiating and bartering . <p> " He likes competition , and he loves to argue , " said Jones , who still lives in New Orleans . " That 's just in him . He 's a good-hearted person . He likes for people to be done right by . " <p> Davis moved to Houston in 1997 with his wife , Carla , who had a job offer here . Davis worked full time at defunct Western Indemnity Insurance Co. for three years and tried criminal cases on the side before opening his own firm , Davis and Associates , in 2000 . <p> The two-attorney firm handles mostly criminal cases and some labor and employment cases . Much of his business comes from repeat clients and referrals , he said . <p> Mumphrey came to him as a referral from another inmate also serving time at the Rufe Jordan Unit in Pampa . <p> Davis has never had a case like Mumphrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe Mumphrey 's claims of innocence when he reopened the case three years ago . <p> I just knew it was a case that could be defended , " he said . <p> He meticulously researched the case and in early 2005 found what he needed to clear Mumphrey 's name - DNA evidence . <p> Request for DNA denied <p> The challenge came in getting the evidence . Davis said initially officials with the Texas Department of Public Safety crime lab in Houston said the agency had the evidence . <p> Davis quickly filed a motion for DNA testing in early 2005 , but a state district judge denied it when the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office said DPS officials told them there was no evidence . <p> Stunned by DPS ' reversal , Davis kept pushing for answers until he got one from a lab supervisor . <p> Frozen samples located <p> The supervisor wrote a letter dated Aug. 18 , 2005 , informing Davis that he had located the frozen DNA samples , consisting of a vaginal swab , the victim 's panties , and blood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another motion in the fall , and the judge granted the testing . <p> Although the system failed Mumphrey , Davis said he does not believe it is broken . <p> It 's easy to judge the whole system on a case-by-case basis , but in a lot of cases it works out OK , " he said . I 'd be lying to you if I said it should be scrapped and thrown away . " <p> ... <p> ABOUT ERIC J.
