Match the couple to the pet and find out what their ( and your ) choice of critter reveals . // So , did you guess right ? Or are you surprised by any of these critter-couple combos ? The truth is , a couple 's choice of pet can reveal a lot about their relationship and their personalities . Want proof ? We asked professional animal trainer Alexandra Powe Allred to spell out what kind of couple is most likely to own each of these pets , from the cute and cuddly guinea pigs to the slow-moving tortoise . Then we checked back with the couples to see if her analysis was on target . Here 's what these pets reflect about their owners ' couple-styles. the fun lovers &; the tortoise The expert says : " Tortoises are perfect for no-nonsense types with not a lot of time to spare . Their owners tend to be free-spirited and very independent . " Aidan : " Maude was a surprise birthday gift from Patrick . I actually wanted a dog , but Pat was against it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're both busy people and travel a lot ; we go away together one or two weekends a month , and I travel for work at least five days a month . Since we 're away so much , we obviously needed a low-maintenance pet , so Maude is perfect . No need to walk her , and if we leave a week 's supply of pellets , she 's all set . The only problem is that tortoises do n't give a lot back ; there 's not a huge emotional bond there . But that 's OK . We have a lot of love to give ; we just do n't have tons of time right now . " the outdoorsy types &; the basset hound The expert says : " Basset hound owners are laid-back , friendly , and approachable . Socially , they prefer intimate settings to large parties . " Jessica : " Doug and I both have high-stress jobs , so when we 're together , we like to keep it low-key . On weekends we 're usually doing something relaxed and outdoorsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running back and forth between us while we play Frisbee . Even the way we got engaged was low-key : Doug proposed while we were taking a walk in the country with Cricket . We 're not the kind of couple who hang all over each other in public , so it would have been totally out of character to have a huge public proposal in a stadium or something . In fact , if he had proposed like that , I might have said no ! " the doting duo &; the guinea pigs The expert says : " Guinea pig owners are affectionate and gentle . They are extremely empathetic and would do anything for the people they care about . " Amanda : " Empathetic ? That 's us . I can tell what kind of mood Steve is in the second I see him , and he 's the same way with me . We both are always going above and beyond to take care of others . I 'm always feeding people , bringing in food to work-Steve says it 's my Jewish mother syndrome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carefully arrange all the veggies in their bowls , even though I know they 'll just tear into them and spill everything . And Steve dotes on them too . I love how sappy he gets with them , calling them cutesy names and patting them on their noses . It 's adorable. " the adventure seekers &; the cats The expert says : " People who own these kinds of cats are unafraid to try new things and go to new places . They like to be social in short stints and can throw a great party , but they also love curling up with a warm blanket and a good book . " Alexandra : " Peter calls me Lucy , as in Lucille Ball , because I always get us into crazy scrapes . I 'll make friends with someone on the train and invite them to dinner , or I 'll sign us up for a softball league , even though neither of us plays softball . We do love parties , but after a few hours we 're ready to go home . Our favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together : We cook , watch a DVD , and curl up in a big down comforter . I guess we 're a lot like our cats in that way . They can be crazy and independent one minute , and then totally cuddly the next . " the happy homebodies &; the pug The expert says : " Pug owners are great friends , the kind of people who are loyal and keep secrets . They 're funny , enthusiastic , and a little mischievous . " Sue : " It 's true , our friends are important to us . But we 're truly each other 's best friends . A pug is perfect for us because pugs want nothing more than to spend every second with their owners-that 's just like me and Gene . Because we have really busy schedules , we look forward to spending all our extra time with each other ( and with Phineas , of course ! ) . That 's when we are happiest . If we 're invited to a party on a day we had planned to just chill out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite . Spending quality time together is a priority for us .
