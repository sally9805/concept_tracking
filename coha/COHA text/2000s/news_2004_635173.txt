<p> ' On the Road Again . " It took me a good week to get that Willie Nelson classic out of my head , only to be replaced by James Taylor 's " Country Road . " And if those two songs were n't enough to drive me batty , I somehow managed to dredge up an old Del Reeves song , " Looking at the World Through a Windshield . " <p> The mind plays funny tricks when the rubber meets the road . <p> My road-food odyssey ( a lot of miles and a lot of meals ) took me to points north and west ( another time I will head in other directions ) . Many of these places have been favorites of mine for years ( Al Johnson 's Swedish Restaurant in Sister Bay , Wis. , for one ) , while others have become instant favorites , based on tips from friends whose taste buds I trust ( Rip 's Tavern in Ladd , Ill. , for example ) . Some of these places are a short hop , some are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or long weekend getaway trip ) this summer , you will find these eateries worth your time ( and your dining dollars ) . <p> Gilbert 's <p> Destination : Lake Geneva , Wis . Food quest : Lakeside fine dining . <p> Gilbert 's is housed in a Queen-Anne-style Victorian mansion that dates back to 1885 . The gingerbread trim alone is worth a couple of photos . With the lake just over there , the flowers in full bloom , and the anticipation of some of the best fine dining outside of Chicago , Gilbert 's is worth a drive anytime , not just on the weekend . <p> Owner/chef Ken Hinlo ( Gilbert is the name of his son ) takes pride in his commitment to going organic as much as possible on his menu of creative contemporary American dishes . I am also enamored of his approach to seasonal delights the likes of fiddlehead ferns ( he pairs them with organic sweet corn ravioli ) and ramps ( which he grills and serves with organic Irish salmon and purple asparagus ) . Another delicious example is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a layer of sweet crab that is as fresh as it gets and wonderfully enjoyable . It 's paired with nutty-tasting jasmine rice and , quite creatively , grilled apricots ( they juxtapose nicely with the sweetness of the crab ) . A hint of tarragon bolsters the tangy chili aioli ( an upscale take on cocktail sauce ) , and that rounds out the flavors beautifully . <p> There 's a lot to enjoy at Gilbert 's . This is one of those menus that makes you ponder your choices while visions of good eating dance in your head . A first for me were the Johnny Jump-ups ( edible flowers that are related to pansies and violets ) that added a delicate sweetness to the salad of mixed field greens , the greens dotted with chunks of tangy organic sheep 's milk cheese and olive oil croutons . Not only colorful , but with an array of textures , this seasonal salad was quite something . <p> If you leave Chicago around 8:30 on a Sunday morning , and you have reservations at Gilbert 's for brunch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time to enjoy the dim-sum-style brunch ( carts and trays tableside so you can choose as you please ) . Features include homemade buttermilk biscuits with organic sausage gravy , eggs Benedict with organic ham , stuffed French toast , and apricot and chocolate crepes . <p> Gilbert 's , 327 Wrigley , Lake Geneva , Wis. , ( 262 ) 248-6680 . Hours : Sunday brunch , 10 a.m. -2 p.m . Reservations recommended ; **26;724;TOOLONG . <p> Rip 's Tavern <p> Destination : Starved Rock State Park . Food quest : Fried chicken . <p> Ladd , Ill. ( population , 1,313 ) , is not even on the road atlas I keep in my car . Take exit 70 ( Spring Valley/Ladd ) off Interstate 80 , and drive a few miles north on Ill . Hwy. 89 until you come to a brick building with a line out the door and a big neon chicken in the window . The structure housing Rip 's Chicken has recently been rebuilt , but Rip 's goes back to 1936 ( Rip 's grandson runs the place ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a certain charm about this 100-plus-seat restaurant/tavern . Atmosphere aside , the deal here is the fried chicken , and if you can find any better fried chicken than this , let me know . I do know this : There 's a good reason for that line out the door just about every weekend . This is fried chicken  --  crunchy and crispy on the outside , moist and flavorful clear to the bone  --  that you will drool over . <p> Have your mind made up when you get asked " Light or dark ? " That 's it , and " it " is delicious . The quarter chicken gets plopped atop and alongside a haystack of decent fries and a slice of Italian bread . Even though you get a fork , you will be licking your fingers . This is the best paper-plate eating you will find outside a church bake sale . It 's three bucks for the dark chicken and $3.50 for the light . Sliced pickles , coleslaw and , when appropriate , " crumbs , " which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tip : If you want to avoid the weekend lines , try to get to Rip 's before 7 p.m . <p> Rip 's Tavern , 311 North Main , Ladd , Ill. ; ( 815 ) 894-3051 . Hours : Wednesday 4:40-10 p.m. ; Thursday 5-9:30 p.m. ; Friday 4:40-10 p.m . Saturday 4:40-11 p.m. ; Sunday 2:40-10:30 p.m . <p> CANNOVA 'S <p> Destination : Galena , Ill . Food quest : Italian and pizza . <p> Up the road a piece from Rip 's Chicken is Cannova 's . One of my top choices for food in Galena , Cannova 's has been a family-run operation since 1921 ( the original is in Freeport , and it was founded by Anthony Cannova and later run by his son , Frank ) . Today , Cannova 's is owned by Pat Beckman and his wife , Linda ( daughter of Frank Cannova ) . Quaint ( brick walls , old pictures , a big mural ) , small ( 13 tables ) , and well-run , Cannova 's menu is an almost even split between pizza and pasta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of puff on the edges here and there ) . The " Cannova 's Classic " pizza is a very tasty tribute to more than a few toppings ( tomatoes , garlic , spinach , olive , basil , mozzarella ) . But I am more in love with " Cannova 's Supreme , " the lusty , more traditional assembly of sausage , green peppers , onions , mushrooms and pepperoni . <p> On the pasta end of things , Cannova 's makes a fine red sauce , so go with a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs and you will be set up for the trip back home ( or wherever you are headed ) . Pastas come with a house salad , and the highest-priced dish on the menu is shrimp Alfredo , which goes for $12.25 . <p> Cannova 's wine list is nicely in tune with the menu . You wo n't find any lowball prices by the bottle , but with either your pizza or pasta , the Sangiovese , Albola , is a nice Tuscan red for the price ( $22.00 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice Sicilian feel to the place . <p> Cannova 's 247 Main , Galena , ( 815 ) 777-3735 . Hours : 5-9 p.m . Monday-Thursday ; 11:30 a.m. -2 p.m. and 5-10 p.m . Friday ; Noon-10 p.m . Saturday ; 1-9 p.m . Sunday <p> TRATTORIA STEFANO <p> Destination : Sheboygan , Wis . Food quest : Italian . <p> Swinging northeast to Sheboygan , there are a couple of delicious possibilities . One of the best Italian restaurants north of Milwaukee is Trattoria Stefano . I was put on to this place several years ago by a Chicagoan who has a second home in Kohler . Keep this place in mind for a couple of reasons . The food is excellent ; the atmosphere is casual and pleasant , and since it is only about 55 miles north of Milwaukee , it 's a perfect pit stop . The menu is a study in simplicity and engagingly indulgent . Of course you can start with bruschetta or fried calamari . However , the fonduta del forno is a welcome change of pace in which a duo of mozzarella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marzano tomatoes ( the best ) and prosciutto . Baked in the oven ( the al forno part ) , this fonduta ( the fondue part ) is scooped up on toasted bread , and you will find pure bliss in every bite . <p> One of the best pasta dishes is " Penne Della Nonna . " As the menu points out , this is Stefano 's grandmother 's hearty ragu of Italian sausage , ground chuck , oregano , red wine and San Marzano tomatoes . Tossed with Parmigiano , it 's lusty , fragrant , absolutely delicious . <p> Entree choices include osso buco with saffron risotto , veal rib chop ( stuffed with prosciutto and sage ) and , one of my favorites , pollo ripieno ( which translates as " stuffed chicken " ) . In this instance the chicken breast is stuffed with speck ( bacon ) and black truffle cheese before being pan-roasted . It comes with a flavorful complement of roasted rosemary potatoes and sauteed spinach . Trattoria Stefano is making some very high Italian waves in the Sheboygan area . <p> Il @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very casual pizza place ( some appetizers and a few salads ) just across the street . From a classic Margherita pizza to the " pizza alla pepe " ( fresh tomatoes , mozzarella , smoked mozzarella ) , these thin-crust pizzas have good taste and style . <p> Stefano 's : 522 South 8th , Sheboygan , Wis. , ( 920 ) 452-8455 . Hours : 5-9 p.m . Monday-Thursday ; 5-10 p.m . Friday-Saturday . Closed Sundays . Reservations suggested . <p> Eater 's Alert : If you just can not picture yourself being in Sheboygan without having a brat , head over to the Charcoal Inn at 1313 South 8th St. , ( 920 ) 458-6988  --  for one of the finest brats you will find in the Midwest . <p> AL JOHNSON 'S SWEDISH RESTAURANT <p> Destination : Sister Bay , Wis . Food quest : Swedish pancakes . <p> " Al Johnson 's . Oh , yeah , the place with the goats on the roof . " That 's what you hear when that name is mentioned ( worldwide , at that ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof of this wonderful Swedish restaurant smack in the middle of downtown Sister Bay , Wis . I am sure more photos have been taken of those goats on the roof than all of the top movie stars in Hollywood combined . <p> Inside , the feasting is on another level , one that is all about Swedish pancakes with lingonberries , Swedish meatballs ( and more often than not , both of those on the same plate ) . Light as a feather , the delicious Swedish pancakes get an escort of tangy lingonberries and sweet maple syrup , while the all-beef meatballs , redolent of allspice , are as good as you 're going to find outside of Sweden . Breakfast is served all day . <p> Sandwiches , soups and salads are served at lunch , while more elaborate entrees are featured at dinner . <p> This is a family operation . Al Johnson started the Swedish meatballs rolling here back in 1949 . Sons Lars , Rolf and John and daughter Annika all work in the restaurant . And Al himself is at the restaurant daily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss the homemade banana cream pie . <p> Al Johnson 's Swedish Restaurant , 700 N. Bayshore ( Hwy. 42 ) , Sister Bay , Wis. , ( 920 ) 854-2626 . Breakfast , lunch , dinner every day ( closed Christmas Day ) . <p> GREENWOOD SUPPER CLUB <p> Destination : Fish Creek , Wis . Food quest : Friday night fish fry . <p> If I had a nickel for every fillet of fried perch I have eaten here ... <p> The bar is the first thing you see when you come through the door , and it runs left and right of that center point and swings around the corner just past the pool table on the left . The split dining room ( preferred seating is on the right looking out on tall trees and greenery ) is casual , comfortable and rockin ' , especially on a Friday night . The Greenwood Supper Club is a restaurant lost in time , and a place for all times ( it dates back to 1929 ) . <p> However , time is not the issue here to most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table on a Friday night is n't all that bad . Without question the wait is worth it . The Friday night fish fry here is one of the best you will find in Wisconsin ( where a Friday night fish fry is practically a religious experience ) . The fried perch fillets  --  golden brown , tender , sweet , delicious  --  are heaped alongside coleslaw and either french fries or potato salad . I have never had a fish fry here that was n't first-rate ; I have been enjoying Greenwood for 20 years . <p> I would never pass on the perch fry here , but my wife is really hot for the steamed shrimp ( a Wisconsin specialty , especially here ) . The shrimp are steamed in the shell , so it takes some work to get at the good stuff , but the flavor is outstanding . <p> As is the modus operandi for supper clubs , the Greenwood features nightly specials ( Sunday it 's roast turkey and dressing ) , but you can get prime rib every night . <p> Greenwood Supper Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phone .

Food quest : Contemporary American . <p> T. Ashwell 's offers , without a doubt , some of the finest fine dining in Door County . Situated in a grand old house that sports a sweeping porch for indoor/outdoor dining , T. Ashwell 's is on the cutting edge of contemporary American dining in this neck of the woods . The atmosphere ( wood floors , table candles , fireplace , comfortable bar/waiting area , piano player ) is as enticing as the finely crafted food is exemplary . <p> Chef/owner Thomas Ashwell Smith ( graduate of Kendall College in Evanston ) , knows his way around a kitchen . The sprightly seasonal menu offers dishes sizzling with interest . An appetizer that blew me away was a saute of Door County morels and fiddlehead ferns in a cream sauce ( garlic , butter , thyme , cream ) so good I would spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the silky softness of the mushrooms playing off the crunchy texture of the fiddlehead ferns that made it so wonderful . <p> Imagine finding that the fish du jour one night was Copper River salmon . And that the generous , chunky fillets were firm yet nicely done ( seared outside , moist and flavorful on through ) . And that the fish ( crusted gently with fennel , mustard seed and peppercorn ) tasted if it had been caught that day . And that the fillets were nestled on top of a delicious potato pancake with chive sour cream . <p> Nothing but good words , too , for the sun-dried tomato and Gorgonzola ravioli . The homemade ravioli are arranged on a bed of wilted baby spinach with a few more of those earthy morels and perfectly cooked asparagus . <p> Dessert one night was a simple chocolate torte with a ganache lid that must have been a half-inch thick . It was like eating candy and cake at the same time . <p> T. Ashwell 's , 11976 Mink River Rd. , Ellison Bay ( Door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Closed on Tuesdays .
