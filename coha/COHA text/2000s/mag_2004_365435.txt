Breast cancer grows so slowly in an older woman , say doctors , that she can skip the radiation therapy most women endure after surgery . In two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine , researchers followed breast-cancer survivors whose small tumors had been treated with lumpectomy and tamoxifen  --  with or without radiation . In nearly 8% of women ages 50 and older , cancer came back in the same breast without radiation ; with treatment , the relapse rate was less than 1% . In women ages 70 and up , only 4% relapsed without radiation , compared with 1% who had had treatment . <P>  --  By Sora Song
