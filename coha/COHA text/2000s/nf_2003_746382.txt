Biomechanics instruction in American physical education programs has undergone dramatic changes in the last 40 years . The field grew out of the anatomical , physical medicine and rehabilitation roots of physical education , but since the 1970 's biomechanics has developed a strong emphasis in the mechanical bases of human movement . This dual heritage and other factors have prevented the adoption of a consistent approach to the introductory biomechanics course . The history of introductory biomechanics instruction is reviewed with regard to the balance between functional anatomy and mechanics and the emphasis of qualitative and quantitative analysis . Analysis of this history and the biomechanics research suggests that an unbalanced approach to biomechanics instruction tends to lead to inaccurate understanding of human movement and poor application of biomechanics in solving human movement problems . The introductory biomechanics course must strike a careful balance of biological , mechanical , and application content . Interdisciplinary cooperation of physical education scholars is needed in the development of a few principles of biomechanics that can be used as a structure for the application of biomechanics and can be integrated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs in American higher education have undergone dramatic changes since the 1960 's . This latter half of the 20th century is also when biomechanics became a recognized term and specialization within kinesiology and academe ( Atwater , 1980 ; Wilkerson , 1996 ) . Like most immature sciences , biomechanics has struggled to clarify a coherent body of knowledge and has been criticized for its lack of theoretical development ( Hamill , 1991 ) . The rapidly growing body of knowledge and lack of theoretical development have also contributed to inconsistencies in undergraduate biomechanics instruction ( Luttgens 1977 ; Milburn 1996 ) . All the evidence on the content of introductory biomechanics courses in North American higher education suggests only limited content is routinely emphasized by the majority of instructors ( Dillman &; Sears , 1977 ; Marett , Pavlacka , Siler , &; Shapiro , 1984 ; Satern , 1999 ) . Although academic freedom of course content is important , there should be many areas of agreement on the concepts and principles essential for the introductory biomechanics course . The NASPE Biomechanics Academy and its forerunner , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop guidelines and standards for the introductory course . The guidelines recommended two main objectives for the introductory course : " ( 1 ) the knowledge necessary to undertake a systematic approach to the analysis of motor skill activities and exercise programs and ( 2 ) the experience in applying that knowledge to the execution and evaluation of both the performer and the performance in the clinical and educational milieu " ( Kinesiology Academy , 1980 : p. 19 ) . These two objectives remain in the most recent guidelines and standards for teaching the introductory biomechanics course ( Kinesiology Academy , 1992 ) . So the vision for the introductory biomechanics class is to provide fundamentals of biomechanics and examples of how they can be applied in solving human movement problems . The implementation of this vision , however , remains elusive . <p> Unfortunately , the complexity of biomechanics and the breadth of the field has limited theoretical developments and provided for many potential areas of instructional emphasis . The vision of a consistent pedagogical kinesiology ( i.e. introductory biomechanics ) called for by Huffman ( 1977 ) remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal introductory biomechanics course has several historical roots . This paper reviews the flux in the emphasis of introductory biomechanics and argues that the best instructional strategy for future physical educators is a holistic and balanced approach . Specifically , a balance of the three areas ( biological , mechanical , application ) of the current NASPE guidelines and standards ( Kinesiology Academy , 1992 ) is the only justifiable approach . By examining the pressures between different areas of emphasis , it will be shown that overemphasis of any one of these areas tends to lead to an incomplete understanding of human movement and incorrect deductions about the causes and potential improvement of human movement . An unbalanced approach is also inadequate for developing one of the most important professional skills and important applications of biomechanics , the qualitative analysis of movement ( Knudson &; Morrison , 1997 ) . The paper concludes by challenging kinesiology faculty to work together to develop principles of biomechanics that lead to application and foster an interdisciplinary approach to professional physical education . Bouncing Between Biological and Mechanical Approaches <p> American scholars interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20th century had strong connections to departments of medicine and anatomy ( Atwater , 1980 ) . At that time " kinesiology " referred to early forms of biomechanics , the study of the mechanical basis of human movement . The research of that time focused on theories developed from deductive reasoning based on functional anatomy and the earliest studies of sport biomechanics in the United States . Instruction in the introductory " kinesiology " course emphasized functional anatomy since there was little biomechanical research on how human movements were actually created . Research with new tools including electromyography ( EMG ) and cinematography was just beginning to report biomechanical evidence that functional anatomical analysis often leads to incorrect conclusions on muscular function in human movement . By the middle of the 20th century , decades of EMG research had shown that many muscle actions deduced by functional anatomy were often incorrect and could vary across subjects ( Basmajian &; DeLuca , 1985 ) . The first volume of the journal Quest featured a review paper on EMG research that declared this new vision of the dynamic actions of muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work of biomechanists in the 1960 's and 1970 's resulted in the recognition of the term " biomechanics " as a distinct area of inquiry . By the 1970 's , many of the scholars and teachers in this new field of " biomechanics " began to push the pendulum of undergraduate instruction toward mechanics . Some biomechanics textbooks of this time highlighted the new technologies of " mechanical kinesiology , " putting greater emphasis on calculations and correct free body diagrams rather than how an understanding of biomechanics could be used to improve movement ( Barham , 1978 ; Plagenhoef , 1971 ) . This trend clearly continued into the 1980 's ( Marett et al. , 1984 ) . The wide variety of " kinesiology " courses of this era prompted biomechanics leaders to organize the first national conference on teaching kinesiology ( Dillman &; Sears , 1977 ) . This meeting and meetings at other AAHPERD conventions were the catalysts for the first guidelines and standards for undergraduate kinesiology ( Kinesiology Academy , 1980 ) . This new vision of the introductory biomechanics course emphasized both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emphasis on mechanical content was obvious . The vast majority of the competencies are mechanics , with only a few application competencies and functional anatomy clearly identified as prerequisite knowledge . The balance of course content was shifting toward a mechanical rather than an anatomical emphasis . <p> There were several other trends that supported the shift toward an emphasis on mechanics in the introductory course . Some faculty with strong biomechanical training and research programs continued to increase the infusion of mechanical content in the introductory course . Biomechanics instructors are not immune to the tendency of teaching in the manner that they were taught , many with recent experience in biomechanics research courses and seminars . Second , functional anatomy was clearly identified as prerequisite information in the guidelines and standards , so it was easy to de-emphasize the anatomical competencies in favor of newer biomechanical studies and variables . Third , pressures on physical education in higher education at this time also contributed to this emphasis on mechanics . Physical education strove to be identified as an academic discipline ( Henry , 1964 ) and the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty teaching primarily mechanics in the undergraduate course . Fourth , biomechanics textbook authors and publishers fueled the emphasis on mechanics by publishing many new books focused on the mechanical aspects of human movement . <p> The overemphasis of classical mechanics and rigid body models in most modern biomechanical studies has been seen by some scholars as inappropriate simplifications of anatomy and unrealistic reductionism that does not lead to professional application ( Hudson , 1997 ; Phillips &; Clark , 1984 ) . We will see that the overemphasis of mechanics , at the expense of anatomical/biological bases of movement , in undergraduate instruction or professional practice is just as problematic as the purely functional anatomical approach of the past . <p> As the emphasis in the mechanical approach grew , some faculty with expertise in functional anatomy resisted this newly created balance of knowledge . Therefore faculty who attempted a true blending of anatomical and mechanical bases of movement may have been in the minority . Many biomechanics textbooks retained functional anatomy content , struggling to include the new emphasis on mechanics and application to human movement . Undergraduate kinesiology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an introductory course ( called either kinesiology or biomechanics ) that seemed more like a repeat of anatomy or a math/physics course , rather than a course integrating biology and mechanics . <p> Even today the pressure between biological and mechanical bases continues . The current state of highly specialized graduate preparation in biomechanics , turning out Ph.D.s , many without undergraduate or advanced degrees in kinesiology has raised concern about the adequacy of instruction in the anatomical nuances of human movement ( Barlow , 1997 ) . It is ironic that the current trend of kinesiology degree programs leading to allied health careers ( physical therapy , athletic training , physicians assistant , etc. ) has lead a small percentage ( 6% ) of programs to offer different introductory biomechanics courses for specific majors ( Satern , 1999 ) . <p> Could the pendulum be swinging back to a more functional anatomical emphasis in some biomechanics courses ? This would be unfortunate if this emphasis came at the expense of mechanical concepts and principles essential to understanding how muscles actually function in human movement . This would be repeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research showing it is extremely difficult to infer muscle actions from functional anatomy and the observation of movement ( Basmajian &; DeLuca , 1985 ; Hellebrandt , 1963 ) . A professional trying to infer deficits in muscle function from observed movement alone is likely to make errors ( Herbert , Moore , Moseley , Schurr , &; Wales , 1993 ) . Even in biomechanical research , understanding the actions of muscles in human movement is difficult because muscles have actions at joints they do not cross ( Zajac &; Gordon , 1989 ) and it is difficult to separate the effects of muscles from joint forces in linked segment actions ( Putnam , 1991 ; Roberts , 1991 ) . Recent advances in imaging ( Ito et al. , 1998 ; Kawakami et al. , 2000 ) and in vivo force measurement ( Komi , 1990 ; Komi et al. , 1996 ; Roberts et al. , 1997 ) are again improving our understanding of how active and passive tension components within muscles contribute to movement . The next section will show how an approach that integrates biological and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human movement . The Need for Balance <p> The ideal approach to the introductory biomechanics course is a careful balance of biological and mechanical foundations learned in the context of application to real-world human movement problems . There are several areas of biomechanical research that clearly demonstrate only the integration of biological and mechanical information can answer questions on the causes of movement difficulties and the subsequent improvement of these movements . Research in EMG , muscle mechanics , kinetics , and modeling must be integrated to get a complete picture of the multifaceted and interrelated factors that contribute to the biomechanics human motion . This section provides examples of how a balanced vision of the biomechanics course serves the needs of kinesiology and physical education professionals . <p> One strategy for providing a balanced approach would be to begin the course with a brief review of anatomical concepts . This approach is effective in introducing the need for biomechanics by reviewing the discovery of complex activation of muscles that often conflicts with the hypotheses of functional anatomy . As mechanical variables are introduced the instructor must show how biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the concepts of impulse and the time of force application have strong interactions with success and injury-risk in many human movements . Increasing time of force application to slow down an external object in catching increases the change of success and reduces the risk of injury . <p> Sometimes biological factors are more influential than mechanical factors and modify the application of biomechanics . For example , the limited time available for force development in the stance phase of running and muscle force-velocity relationship make it difficult to increase the impulse by increasing the duration of push-off . The preactivation of extensor muscles for a powerful stretch-shortening cycle action is a key biomechanical strategy in sprinting . All throughout the course , biomechanics instructors must strive to show how biological and mechanical factors are integrated to determine the safest and most effective movement . <p> Another strategy for getting students to combine biological and mechanical knowledge on their own is the assignment of term projects . A biomechanics instructor might approve a student project to develop a conditioning program that would be biomechanically appropriate for improving overarm throwing performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exercises to train muscles that contribute to throwing are numerous . The student would review the EMG studies of overarm throwing , being sure to account for how EMG of dynamic movement relates to timing and force of various muscle actions ( Gielen , 1999 ) . The " A " student may even integrate recent research on the activation on the six intra-muscular segments of pectoralis major ( Paton &; Brown , 1994 ) . Kinematic studies should be also reviewed to understand the typical speeds of shoulder motion in the eccentric and concentric phases of the throw , while kinetic studies would provide estimates of the loads the body must withstand in throwing movements . Segmental contribution studies provide evidence on the muscles and motions most strongly related to performance ( Miller , 1980 ) . <p> Given the review of all these data and the opinions of conditioning/sport medicine experts , the student formulates a conditioning program . The student may conclude from the evidence that the apparent stretch-shortening cycle action of the pectoralis major in throwing is critical to the skilled transfer of energy from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student might recommend would include upper body plyometrics , lower loads and faster lifting speeds rather than traditional strength training . An important lesson often learned in these term projects is that most human movement problems must be attacked with educated guesses based on incomplete research and experience . Arguably , the important point is not usually the answer , but learning to how to find the relevant information and integrating the biological and mechanical bases of movement . <p> Valid inferences in the analysis of human movement requires attention to both the biological and mechanical bases of movement . These biomechanical factors must now be integrated at an even higher level with other subdisciplinary ( exercise physiology , motor development , etc. ) knowledge . Good professional practice involves a true interdisciplinary approach or the simultaneous integration of all the sport and exercise sciences and as well as an individual 's professional experience ( Bithell , 2000 ; Di Fabio , 1999 ; Knudson &; Morrison , 1997 ) . Undergraduate biomechanics courses need to strike a balance of biological and mechanical content and this balance should also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of this knowledge for improving human movement . This interdisciplinary vision also creates important connections within the curriculum for professional practice . For example , the acceleration and peak velocities in sprinting can be used to reinforce the limits of anaerobic metabolism . Several examples of integrating all the sport sciences in the qualitative analysis of human movement have been published ( Knudson &; Morrison , 1997 ) . Qualitative and Quantitative Emphases <p> Another area of controversy is whether the introductory biomechanics course should emphasize qualitative or quantitative analysis . Quantitative analysis involves the measurement of mechanical variables and subsequent computations , while qualitative analysis involves subjective judgments based on biomechanical principles and relationships . The NASPE guidelines and standards ( Kinesiology Academy , 1980 , 1991 ) clearly stated the introductory biomechanics course should emphasize qualitative biomechanical analysis , leading to typical qualitative analyses in physical education . There is a long history of scholars advocating this " pedagogical kinesiology " ( Berg , 1975 ; Davis , 1984 ; Huffman , 1984 , 1977 ; Hudson , 1995 ; Norman , 1977 ) vision for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more qualitative analysis emphasis to adhere to the guidelines and standards ( Hay &; Reid , 1982 ; Kreighbaum &; Barthels , 1981 ) . <p> Some biomechanics instructors , however , do not follow this qualitative philosophy but emphasize quantitative problem solving ( Satern , 1999 ) . These instructors believe that extensive experience solving quantitative problems leads to a better understanding of mechanical concepts ( Dowling , Frost , &; Andrews , 1997 ) . Many biomechanists continue to teach emphasizing computer and multimedia instruction ( Miller , 1997 ) and quantitative methods of biomechanical analysis ( Chow , Carlton , Ekkekakis , &; Hay , 2000 ; Dowling , Frost , &; Andrews , 1997 ; Duck , 1997 ; Nicol &; Liebscher , 1983 ) . The advantages of the quantitative approach is that it does teach students problem solving skills and may help extinguish the blind faith many people have in numbers that come from a computer or instrument . <p> However , the belief that an emphasis on quantitative problem solving leads to a better theoretical understanding of mechanics is a contentious point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , there is no evidence that this will lead to the application of this knowledge in the qualitative analyses primarily used in kinesiology professions . Second , considerable scholarly skill and technical knowledge is required to perform an accurate and meaningful quantitative biomechanical analysis . Most practitioners or students with one biomechanics course do not have the expertise to perform meaningful quantitative biomechanical studies . There is danger in having partially trained persons running complex biomechanical software and using meaningless data to base professional decisions . Third , students in an introductory course generally do not have the knowledge and experience necessary to understand the biomechanics literature and formulate meaningful research projects . <p> The pressures to continue a primary emphasis on quantitative methods of biomechanics in introductory courses are strong at the dawn of the 21st century . The increasing power of computers and the decreasing cost of software have made quantitative biomechanics capability within reach for most universities . Political and financial pressures on higher education tempt administrators to experiment with investments in " educational technology , " " computer assisted instruction " , " hypermedia , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . The nonsignificant benefits of many innovative computertized instruction programs over traditional instruction in physics ( Coleman , Holcomb , &; Rigden , 1998 ; Mottmann , 1999 ; Steinberg , 2000 ) and biomechanics ( Boysen &; Francis , 1982 ; McPherson &; Guthrie , 1991 ) suggest little more than a novelty effect for several of these computer instruction " innovations . " Appropriate uses of instructional technology are hard to define and develop , so the pressure to deliver quantitative biomechanics instruction by computer and web based programs should be carefully examined . Change to quantitative and computerized biomechanical analysis as content for the introductory biomechanics course , essentially for change sake ( since there are no data to support its use ) must be resisted . <p> Another reason to critically examine this trend are the myriad of unintended consequences of wholesale adoption of technology ( Ziegler , 1997 ) . An example of a major mistake in higher education from a century ago , similar to the current distance learning craze of today , is the growth of correspondence courses . Most importantly , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basics of biomechanics and its applications in the kinesiology professions will likely require considerable face-to-face interaction of students and faculty . The introductory course is most effective when laboratories can be organized around the exploration of real-world problems and with the focus on developing skills for the professional qualitative analysis of human movement . <p> The introductory biomechanics course should clearly expose students to both qualitative and quantitative biomechanical analysis . If the instructor must emphasize one over the other , the predominant emphasis should be the qualitative understanding and application of biomechanical concepts . Biomechanical formulas in the introductory course should be taught in their algebraic form , rather than their calculus form . When laboratory experiences are available , the majority should use actual movement experiences and qualitative biomechanical analyses ( e.g. Knudson , 1997 ; McGinnis &; Abendroth-Smith , 1991 ) rather than extensive digitizing or numerical computations . Biomechanical formulas should be covered , but the computations should not be accentuated more than the meaning of the formula and the relationships of the quantities . All too often students can not see the huge forest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their visual field . Biomechanical Principles and Interdisciplinary Application <p> The NASPE guidelines and standards ( Kinesiology Academy , 1992 ) provide a comprehensive vision of the introductory course that balances the mechanical and biological foundations of human movement in the context of qualitative professional application . Quantitative biomechanics has a place in the introductory course , but should not be overemphasized so the class becomes more about biomechanics research than learning biomechanics and its applications . Unfortunately , guidelines and standards are weak on how to teach the application of biomechanics . The guidelines and standards only have 5 application competencies , which are about 10% of all the exit competencies . This weakness in the guidelines and standards is a particular problem for many faculty who teach introductory biomechanics but do not have a specialization in the area . With the current unbalanced instruction in biomechanics and this lack of guidance in the guidelines and standards , it is little wonder that students leaving our programs can not qualitatively analyze movement ( Berg , 1975 ; Hoffman , 1977 , 1984 ; Knudson , Morrison , &; Reeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biomechanics course prepared you to qualitatively analyze most sport and human movements ? <p> An effective strategy to help build a unified and applied vision of biomechanics instruction that leads toward application is the establishment of biomechanical principles . Introductory biomechanics needs to be taught using a general structure of biomechanical principles applied to real-world problems in the improvement of human movement and the prevention or treatment of injury . Many biomechanists have been interested in adapting mechanical principles to sports and other human movements ( e.g. Broer &; Zernicke , 1979 ; Bunn , 1955 ; Dowell , 1982 ; Dyson , 1970 ; Groves &; Camaione , 1975 ; Jensen &; Schultz , 1977 ; Kreighbaum &; Barthels , 1981 ; Luttgens &; Wells , 1982 ) . These texts have been organized around many specific principles adapted from the laws of physics or a few key principles focused on how they apply to fundamental movement patterns . The most logical approach is to adopt a small set of general principles of biomechanics . Having eight to ten principles of biomechanics that can be applied to all movements provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These more general expressions of biomechanical principles have been successfully adapted for the qualitative analysis of movement by pedagogy scholars ( Johnson , 1990 ; Matanin , 1993 ; Nielsen &; Beauchamp , 1992 ; Williams &; Tannehill , 1999 ; Wilkinson , 1996 ) . <p> Problems that make the quest for unifying principles of biomechanics elusive are a lack of agreement about the core principles/theories or even the appropriate terminology . Therefore students sent to read the biomechanical literature find the principle/theory behind the apparent sequential coordination of high-speed movements could be the kinetic link , kinematic chain , transfer of momentum , transfer of energy , or summation of segment velocities . Biomechanics faculty need to work together to come to agreement on the appropriate terminology and principles for the introductory course , but this is only part of a larger interdisciplinary process within kinesiology . Biomechanics scholars need to work with other kinesiology scholars to develop a few core biomechanical principles for application in the qualitative analysis of human movement . This interdisciplinary process of principle development has been like other interdisciplinary efforts in physical education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A place to begin this interdisciplinary discussion of establishing a few general principles of biomechanics is with the general principles proposed by Norman ( 1975,1977 ) and Hudson ( 1995 ) . Norman 's ten principles of biomechanics allows students to focus on the mechanical causes of poor performance in qualitative analysis , but uses physics terminology that is quite distant from the applied terminology of the profession . The core concepts proposed by Hudson ( 1995 ) uses more practitioner/performer level terminology and focuses on technique factors that are observable and manipulatable by performers . A blending of both these approaches would likely be the ideal approach to formalizing principles of biomechanics that could be agreed upon by scholars and be easily applied in the wide variety of professional settings for kinesiology graduates . As a beginning point for the discussion , Table 1 summarizes nine principles of biomechanics the author uses in his introductory biomechanics course . Summary <p> We have seen the content of the introductory biomechanics course continues to be a controversial issue with instructional emphasis swinging like a pendulum based on instructor , institutional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that an unbalanced approach ( overemphasis of one perspective ) leads to incorrect understanding of the creation of human movement and poor application of biomechanics . Given the contextual , multifaceted , and interrelated nature of the factors that affect human movement , a balanced vision of the introductory biomechanics class is most appropriate . Nine principles of biomechanics were proposed as one way to illustrate the application of biomechanics in professional qualitative analysis of human movement . It is hoped this paper will serve to simulate discussion on biomechanical principles that connect to practice and other kinesiology subdisciplines . For the kinesiology professions to advance and prove their worth to the public as movement improvement experts , it is important that this interdisciplinary vision of instruction , research , and professional services be adopted .
