m.n // Pie // Fishing // m.n // My grandmother , who my brother , Bailey , and I called Momma , baked lemon meringue pie that was unimaginably good . My brother and I waited for the pie . We yearned for it , longed for it . Bailey even hinted and dropped slightly veiled suggestions about it , but none of his intimations hastened its arrival . Nor could anything he said stave off the story that came part and parcel with the pie . // Bailey would complain , " Momma , you told us that story a hundred times " or " We know what happened to the old woman " and " Momma , can we just have the pie ? " ( Momma always ignored his attempts to prevent her from telling the tale . ) But if we wanted Momma 's lemon meringue pie , we had to listen to the story : // There was an old woman who had made it very clear that she loved young men . Everyone in town knew where her interests lay so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house . Old men had to be called to clean out her chimney or fix her roof or mend her fences . She learned to count on finding young strangers who were traveling through the area . // One Sunday morning there was a new young man in church sitting alone . Mrs. Townsend saw him and as soon as the last hymn was sung , before anyone else could reach him , she rushed over to his bench . // " Morning , I 'm Hattie Townsend . What 's your name ? " // " George Wilson , ma'am . " // She frowned a little . // " Anybody get to you ? " // " No , ma'am . I do n't know anyone here . Just passed by , saw the church , and stopped in . " He had used the word ma'am out of courtesy . // She was all smiles again . " Well , then I 'm inviting you , and I am a good cook , to my house for Sunday dinner . I have my own chickens and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rich . I live in walking distance . Here is my address ; come around this afternoon around three o'clock . " // She patted him on the shoulder and left the church . // A few young men from the congregation rushed over . // " Mrs. Townsend invited you for dinner ? " // " Yes . " // " Well , I 'm Bobby . Here 's Taylor and this one is Raymond . We 've all been to her house and she 's a good cook . " // The men started laughing . // " No , she 's a great cook . It 's just that after you eat , she pounces. " // " Man , the lady can pounce . " // The stranger said , " I do n't mind a little pouncing. " // They all laughed again . " But man , she 's old . She 's older than my mother . " // " She 's older than my grandmother . " // " She 's older than baseball . " // The stranger said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of myself . Thanks , fellas , for warning me. " // Bobby shouted , " Her lemon pie will make a rabbit hug a hound . " // Taylor added , " Make a preacher lay his Bible down . " // Meanwhile , Mrs. Townsend entered her house and went directly to her sewing box . She put on her glasses and took out a needle . // She walked back down the path to her house and stuck the needle in a tree . // She returned to the house and began to cook a chicken she had resting in the refrigerator . For the next hour she stirred pots and shifted pans , then she set her dining table for two . She had time to freshen up and change before her company came . // " Well , welcome , Mr. Wilson . " // He was a little cooler than he had been at church . // She knew why but she also knew he had n't eaten her cooking . // " The bathroom is here if you would like to freshen up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course everything was ready , but she wanted him to have time to breathe in the fine aromas floating in the air . // She served him chicken and dumplings . Chicken tender as mercy and dumplings light as summer clouds . // The side dishes were fried yellow summer squash and English peas . // He did n't care that he was eating as if he had n't eaten in a month . She kept pressing him , " Eat some more , but save a place for dessert . Some people swear by my lemon meringue pie . " // Between bites she thought she heard him mumble , " That 's my favorite . " // When he put his first bite of Mrs. Townsend 's pie in his mouth , he was hers . He was ready to marry her or let her adopt him . // She sat opposite and watched as with each forkful he surrendered more . // After the second slice he would have followed her to the Sahara Desert . // She said , " Let 's go out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yes , ma'am . " // Once they settled into the swing on the porch she said , " My goodness , night has fallen . It 's quite dark . " // " Yes , ma'am . It 's dusk all right . " // They swung a few times . // She asked , " What on earth is that shining down there in that tree ? " // He squinted , " I ca n't hardly see a tree . " // She said , " Yes , I see it . It 's either a needle or a pin shining . Well , I do say . It 's a needle . " // He asked , " You can tell ? " // She said , " Yes , I see the hole . I 'll go get it . " // He said , " Well , that proves you are not as old as they say you are . When you come back I may have some talk for you .

After much fumbling she was able to stand erect . She saw that she had fallen over a cow that had lain down in the lane . // Mr. Wilson saw her fall , and he could see the cow . When she gave a little scream , he bounded off the porch to help her . Once she collected herself , he said , " Well , thank you for dinner . I have to go . " // She asked , " Ca n't you stay for one more slice of pie ? " The strength of the pie can be seen in the fact that he did stop to think about it . // She took his arm as if she was n't going to give it back . He thought of the pie again and then the cow and the possible pouncing .
