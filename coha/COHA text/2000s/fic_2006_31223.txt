It was the eighties . The summer of 1989 , to be exact . Hip-hop was conscious . Rebellious . Stronger than the blackest cup of your mama 's black coffee . Public Enemy was barreling through the airwaves . " Fight the power . We got to fight the powers that be . " But no matter how much conscious rap we were listening to , niggas were still wildin ' out , especially me and my brother Bing . Throwing bricks through car windows , crank-ringing doorbells , stealing candy from the corner store , and hanging out in the alley with baby hoodrats , lifting up their shirts and looking at their baby breasts , nipples shaped like Mike &; Ikes . It 's not like they were all that big , but to us they were winning . We were young and having fun . We were on one , living life the only way we knew . In the streets as much as we could be for as long as we could , or at least until somebody 's grandmama came running out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You see these damn streetlights ! Do n't make me come off this porch . " We were hoping to God that just one time she would come off the porch , but she never had to . In the ' hood , grandmamas werelike the ghetto E. F. Huttons . When they spoke , cats listened . The Pro-Wings were hitting the asphalt . Life could n't get any better . And as bad as the world may have seemed to folks on the outside , from the inside , it was perfect . Even in the worst times , niggas still got their party on . Like the time Mrs. Johnson lost her job and got evicted , and Mrs. Jenkins threw her a rent party charging ten dollars a plate for some fried chicken , collard greens , and macaroni and cheese that did n't cost no more than two dollars to make . Or the time Mrs. Parker 's phone got cut off and Mrs. Patterson let her get another one in her five-year-old son 's name . Shit did n't faze us , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , but the little we had , Mama always made it seem like more . Like on birthdays . By the time Bing 's rolled around , whatever I 'd gotten on mine was rewrapped in a Broadway box with a stick-on bow and given to him . And those Christmases when money was tight , and we only got a Hot Wheel , some socks , and a pack of Fruit of the Loom . But by the time all the kids in the neighborhood played with each other 's toys , it did n't matter , ' cause what one got , we all got . That was on the east side of Long Beach . One day Mama came home with the bright idea to move us to North Long Beach , supposedly for something better . The way I saw it , though , North Long Beach rats were just as nasty as east side rats  --  they just breathed ocean air . So off we went , looking like Arnold and Willis , cramming all our stuff into her dented-up , dingy blue Nova with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were singing the theme from The Jeffersons as the car backfired out of one ' hood and into another . " Here we are , " Mama said , smiling and looking proud , like we had just pulled into Beverly Hills . Judging from the chipped stucco and barred windows ; the liquor store next to the pawnshop next to the Nix Check Cashing Store next to First Baptist across the street from Third Baptist down the block from Second Baptist ; Church 's Chicken ; and the older cats with the brown paper bags stumbling in the streets  --  instead of moving on up , we 'd just moved over . We unloaded the one good couch covered in plastic that she would never let us sit on . It did n't matter who you were , you was n't sitting on that couch . She did n't even sit on it . Next , we unloaded her favorite chair , the one place where she did sit . The tweed chair . The one that when you got up , it damn near scraped the skin off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass . So old that the zipper was broken and yellow foam came out every time you sat down . She could n't have been comfortable , but that 's where she sat . And if you wanted to sit , that 's where you sat , too . Inside the apartment there was leftover gold shag carpeting from whoever lived there before . African beads dangled in the hallway . We had one bathroom and the hot water only stayed hot for ten minutes . Mama had the big room , which was n't much bigger than the one Bing and I shared . At night you could hear the next-door neighbors threaten to kill each other , drunk on some cheap liquor . " Bitch , I'ma kill you ! " " If I do n't shank you first , you snaggle-tooth muthafucka ! " After that , the fucking began . " Bitch , I'ma kill that pussy ! " " If you do n't , another nigga will , you one-tooth bastard ! " Bing and I could hardly sleep for the bedpost banging and more " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even with all that , Mama was still content with the move she had made , making us think it was hers , when really it was Grandma 's . " Blackdammit , Barbara , get them boys outta the east side , " my grandma had said , pouring herself a little taste in her morning coffee . " ' Cause if you do n't , I will . These streets ai n't nothing but a breeding ground for trouble , " she continued . It did n't matter what she said , " blackdammit " was always in there somewhere . It was her way of cussin ' , but not really . No matter how we 'd gotten here , we were here . And whenever I watched Mama pass by that one good couch so she could sit in that one bad chair , I knew that one day I wanted to get her couches , clothes , and whatever else she wanted as long as it was new . Mama was our seventies soul superhero , still sporting a nappy ' fro fifteen years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fine like she 'd never had kids . My boys would make jokes about how sexy she was . Jokes that I never found funny . Every Saturday morning she had us cleaning up the house to a never-ending eight-track tape of Aretha Franklin 's Young , Gifted and Black , which by now we had memorized line for line . I would vacuum to " Rock Steady , " Bing would sweep the dirt onto Earth , Wind and Fire 's All ' N All album cover , while Mama would yell in the background , " Boy , do n't you know that 's The Elements ? ! " Mama would sometimes pay us a dollar , but to get out of cleaning I 'd give Bing a quarter of mine . Since he was five years younger , a quarter went a long way . I really did n't have to give him anything and he still would have done it . Bing was my man . He got his nickname from when he was two , running too fast , and he slammed headfirst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it hit . The way he bounced off it , we all thought his head had cracked open , but it did n't . He shot back up and staggered away . From then on , his name was Bing . On the weeknights after work , Mama would come home , flip off her shoes , fire up the hibachi , and throw on some chicken wings , burgers , and links . It was like the Fourth of July weekend . Life could n't be better . As we ate , she had the good sounds flowing through the house  --  Johnny Taylor , Betty Wright , and Tyrone Davis 's " Turn Back the Hands of Time " was her favorite . We were dancing , singing , laughing , having a good time doing the Bump , the Rump , or whatever hot dances were out at the time . My mom , Bing , and I , we were best friends . We were all we had and all we needed . She even let us get a little taste . She 'd pour herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and act like she was surprised when she got back and there was n't none left . She knew what Bing and I were doing , but she did n't trip . And even our imperfect world where sometimes the light bill was n't paid , or the window air-conditioner never blew cool air , or the busted pipe from upstairs stained our ceiling , was still perfect to us . We even had our own pet mouse named Ben . Ben would wait until two a.m. to race across the floor . Really he belonged to our neighbors by day , but at night he was ours . To us , life could n't get any better . This was how it was supposed to be , at least in our minds . That is , until one day Aunt Estelle came by with her crooked hat , matted wig , dress down to her ankles , and carrying a hundred-pound Bible . She was n't really our aunt , at least not by blood . She was Uncle Donnie 's wife , my mama 's oldest brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got married , but we still called her our aunt . She had a strange look on her face . A look that let me know that shit was about to get all fucked up . Continues ...
