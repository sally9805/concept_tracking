Counselor educators must consider the possibilities associated with technology-enhanced counselor training and research . The focus of this article was to identify the technology competencies that should be acquired by graduate students who successfully complete the counseling programs . <p> The counselor educators have an opportunity to model efficient , meaningful and educationally sound use of technology . According to a survey by the American College Teacher ( The Chronicle of Higher Education , 1999 ) , among 33 , 785 faculty members at 378 colleges and universities , the aging of the faculty plays into several trends  --  like the fact that older faculty report being more stressed by information technology even though they are n't using it as much as younger faculty . Keeping up with information technology was a source of stress for 67 per cent of the academics  --  more so for women than for men , and for older professors than for younger ones . <p> Age also affected how professors use computers . More than 90 per cent of those less than 45 years old communicated via E-mail at least twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or older . Among professors fewer than 35.61 per cent used a computer at least twice a week to " conduct scholarly writing , " and 45 per cent to do research using the Internet . For professors in the 55-64 age group , the proportions for those activities were 48 per cent and 28 per cent respectively ( The American College Teacher , 1999 ) . <p> ACES ' ( Association for Counselor Education and Supervision ) Technology Interest Group Network report has recommended ten technical competencies ( T. Hohenshil , Personal communication via E-mail to The Education Trust , April , 1998 ) . However , recently , the Network has recommended twelve technical competencies for counselor education students ( T. Hohenshil , 2000 ) . At the completion of a counselor education program , all students should : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> According to a survey by the ACES ' Technology Group Interest Network ( Myers &; Gibson , 1999 ) , counselor educators and students lack a uniformly high level of competencies in each of the 12 areas . More research is needed to determine the technology competencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the researcher sent a modified survey to ascertain the perceptions of counselor educators and counselors regarding the technology competencies that should be incorporated into the counselor education curriculum . The survey contained a set of 15 technology competencies that counselor education graduates should have at the completion of their counseling program . The survey instruments were randomly sent to counselor educators ( n=125 ) and counselors ( n=75 ) requesting them to rank the technology competencies that counseling graduates should have at the completion of their graduate programs . One hundred ten counselor educators and sixty-five counselors returned the survey with relative ranking and additional recommendations . The relative rank order and percent of responses of each technical competencies selected by the counselor educators and counselors are shown in Table 1 . <p> Even though some technical competencies have been identified for integrating technology into the counselor training curriculum , particular attention should be paid to the technology integration process such as selection , acquisition , implementation and integration into the counselor training activities . Awareness of these phases enables counselor educators to adjust their focus as they move through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselor productivity . <p> Counselor training should provide the technical skills and theoretical knowledge essential to integrate technology into counselors ' work with all students , school personnel , parents , colleagues and the community ( Hartman , 1998 ) . The trainees must have a framework on how technology is and is not impacting students , teachers , families , and their community . Specifically , it is expected that counselor trainees will be knowledgeable about state and national technology initiatives , quantitative and qualitative research on the use of technology in and out of schools , pedagogical issues and concerns , instructional intervention methods , social and cultural inequities , and an overview of current literature on the subject . <p> Counselor educators must consider the possibilities associated with technology-enhanced counselor training and research . The use of appropriate electronic tools can profoundly impact and enhance counselor training and the counseling services provided to the clientele . The goals of technology-enhanced counselor training should guide the trainers in the following directions : ( 1 ) advance a vision of how information technology is used as an essential tool by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) extend counselor understanding of the productivity demands made on counselors and of the potential tools that facilitate productivity , and ( 3 ) rethink how counselors and other helping professionals work in light of available information technologies . Counselor training must incorporate a component that introduces technology and the use of electronic tools in counselor productivity . <p> The widespread availability of computers and productivity software provides counselors with new opportunities to work more effectively and efficiently than in the past . There is enough research evidence to show that the development of information technology tools will continue to impact the knowledge and skills needed by counselors and other helping professionals ( Baker , 1996 : Friedheim &; Faffee , 1999 ; Hammer &; Champy , 1993 ; Kennedy , 1993 : Sherry , Billig , Tavalin &; Gibson , 2000 ) . There seems to be an urgency to understand the potential benefits of information technology in order to provide efficient and competitive services in the community and the world ( Peppers &; Rogers , 1997 ) . Currently , educational institutions in the United States are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual budgets on technology ( Quality Education Data , 1997 ; Stith , 2000 ) . Unfortunately , in contrast to the business community , colleges and universities are still lagging behind in the use of information technologies . <p> Although the potential of technology to impact the work of counselors has been generally recognized ( Harrison &; Stephen , 1996 ) , the day to day work of counselors appears largely unchanged . This may be due to the fact that traditional efforts to use technology have focused on the integrated software package ( Edyburn , 1999 ) . <p> In conclusion , a critical component of counselor education training is technology competencies . Because counselor competence in using technology has a direct bearing on the quality of counseling services received by the clients , an effort has been made to identify specific skills that are being used in the counseling process . The purpose of this article was to identify the technology competencies that should be acquired by students who successfully complete the counseling programs and this study suggest further development in this area .
