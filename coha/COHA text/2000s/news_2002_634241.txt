<p> There are 26,000 homeless youth in Illinois without a safe place to sleep . With about 12,000 of these young people in Chicago , there are fewer than 40 emergency shelter beds available . The Night Ministry 's Open Door Shelter provides 16 of these beds , and has to refuse services to five youths for every one we can accommodate . <p> Where do these young people turn when they do not have a place to stay ? The streets . For many of the youths we serve , it is safer to be on the streets than to continue trying to survive in their home situation . <p> The youths we serve are kids who fall through the cracks . Blending in on the streets , they are invisible not only because they turn 18 and no longer fit into the system . Nobody wants them , yet they still have few skills to fend for themselves . Most comprehensive adult services are n't available until they turn 21 . Without help , they become tomorrow 's victims , potential perpetrators , and the chronically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to hear their message : " We need your help . " <p> We understand that the state budget has a deficit of almost $2 billion , and that it is up to our Illinois lawmakers to balance this budget . This budget , however , can not be balanced on the backs of Illinois ' most vulnerable citizens . Over the last year , three youth shelters and one drop-in center have been closed . We realize that all human services organizations do equally important work that is threatened by budget cuts . We ask our state leaders not to pit programs or organizations against each other , but to support all of the programs that are vital to the well-being of their constituents . <p> We urge legislators to support reasonable alternatives for revenue enhancement to fully fund needed services . With their commitment , human services can be preserved in Illinois . <p> The Rev. Tom Behrens , president , <p> The Night Ministry , Uptown <p> Why has our so-called president waited eight months to reveal that he was warned about Osama bin Laden and Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew even more than he now admits ? And when will the right-wing nut jobs who attacked Rep. Cynthia McKinney ( D-Ga. ) for raising questions about what the White House knew apologize to her and endorse her for re-election ? <p> Inquiring minds want to know . I hope your reporters are up to the task of answering these questions . <p> And my main question remains : Why did the White House wait eight months to reveal this information , when they were asked repeatedly about these well-known facts and repeatedly denied knowing anything ? President Bush 's pale , trembling demeanor the day of the attack might be attributed to his realization that he 'd made a huge mistake , rather than the physical cowardice I first suspected . <p> Pete Hisey , Near North Side <p> Years ago , Arab nationals bombed the World Trade Center , they bombed our embassies , they hijacked our planes , they bombed our Navy ship and now we learn that one month before Sept. 11 , the CIA warned George W. Bush that Arab nationals were planning to hijack our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 11 , George W. Bush and his administration allowed 19 Arab nationals to board our airplanes armed with knives . This is the worst national security screw-up in our history , and George W. Bush is culpable . <p> Bill Schmucker , <p> Lake Geneva , Wis . <p> I admired Harry Truman but was perplexed by his participation in the creation of the state of Israel . Land was taken from others , and we had just been through a world war over such conduct . It was rationalized that Jews would have extreme difficulty living in Europe , now that the war was over . The attitude toward Jews living in places like Germany and Poland was a concern . The Cold War was beginning and the new state of Israel would give us an ally to arm in an area not too far from Russia . Truman 's mentor , Louis D. Brandeis , had been active in the Zionist Movement for many years before he died in 1941 , and Truman had a chance to show his gratitude . <p> America has assumed responsibility for maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why ? <p> Whatever nuclear weapons Iraq and North Korea may have is trivial compared to what we know Israel has and will use . Go back 30 years and see how much our loss of equity ownership of now OPEC oil properties has cost us for our stake in Israel . See if America 's total cost of Israel to date can be calculated . It 's time for us to clean up the mess we made and restore the world . The future is gruesome . <p> Jack Brown , Jacksonville <p> As a family member of a victim of violent crime , I read with interest your May 5 story " Blame judges for jail crowding ? " . I can personally attest to how slow the system works . My family went to court more than 20 times in a two-year period for " preliminary hearings " in a sexual assault case . <p> Each time , we walked out of the courtroom not knowing what happened until someone from the state 's attorney 's office explained that the judge issued another continuance and another court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the courage to be in the same room with her attacker , and each time she had to endure his evil smirk . <p> In the end , a plea agreement was reached , and an actual trial was never held . No one could explain to us why it took so long . Someone told us " the wheels of justice turn slowly . " But I kept thinking of another saying : " Justice delayed is justice denied . " <p> Theresa Campbell , <p> Norwood Park <p> Let 's not blame judges for the overcrowded jail . Many other factors play a part in the situation . Drug laws and drug crimes further complicate the workings of the justice system . But the primary blame for crowded jails rightly belongs to the alleged criminals . <p> Incarceration has lost potency as a deterrence in preventing crime . Longer sentences have proven to be more costly to the taxpayers than the good they were supposed to provide . Lawmakers and lawbreakers contribute more to the problem than do workers in the criminal justice system . <p> Hollis Chester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the unspeakable acts of the suicide bomber as being the result of despair and hopelessness . This is not true . The suicide bomber is the most hopeful person who has ever existed . He is utterly consumed by his hope for the destruction of Israel . <p> This is the message that booms forth from virtually every mosque in the Middle East , week after week , with the tacit approval of the " moderate Arab states . " It is called for in the textbooks given to children and is supported by the state-controlled media . While the European community and the United States have poured millions into building the Palestinian Authority , there is little to show as Yasser Arafat emerges from the rubble waving his victory sign . <p> The Israelis are also refugees : refugees from the Holocaust , refugees from the Arab countries , refugees from Russia , Ethiopia and the Balkans . These refugees came to Israel with a dream and built a strong democracy with a hope for a better future for their children . <p> President Bush is a good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace side by side . Until the Palestinians can somehow put aside their all-consuming hope for the destruction of Israel and get down to the serious business of building their own country , peace will only be a dream . <p> Edward S. Margolis , Wilmette <p> Tony Blair has introduced a bill to " link benefits to social behavior , " saying , " If people get benefits from the state , they owe some responsibility in return ; parents of truant students should not receive benefits . " Although he is the leader of the Labor Party in England , personal responsibility is a conservative issue , and it should be pursued by conservatives here . <p> More Americans should subscribe to the idea that taxpayers paying for services to others is wrong when those others are asked to do nothing in return . Services and benefits should be considered akin to private or government grants , or fellowships : Those applying should prove their merit . <p> Take the situation of disruptive children whose parents receive benefits , and who are allowed to ruin the educational experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd understanding is that those very children and their parents should not suffer the consequences of the unsocial behavior , but that they need still more benefits , more special programs and more hand-outs , paid for by the very ones they disrupt . <p> Margarita Matlis , Evanston <p> With O'Hare Airport No. 1 or No. 2 in the nation , Mayor Daley seems determined to add runways to a highly congested airline facility . The pollution and noise have already directly blighted an area within three or four miles of O'Hare . It has indirectly blighted villages as far from the traffic center as Glenview ( 9 miles ) and Wilmette ( 12 miles ) . <p> My former home in Glenview was directly under one of several flight paths . Forty percent of the day  --  between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.  --  planes passed directly overhead at altitudes averaging just over 3,000 feet at 70-second intervals . It was intolerable , and I sold . In Wilmette , the planes fly , still noisily , but most of them a bit higher and only one hour a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul " Shoe Box " Powell , " smells the meat a-cookin ' " when he views O'Hare expansion . It 's very good indeed for pinstripe patronage , but not too good for Chicago taxpayers ; very detrimental for west , northwest and north suburban communities . <p> If we must , let 's build at Peotone . Much better , contain this public nuisance at its present level and strive to become the nation 's fourth or fifth busiest airport . <p> Congratulations to Sen. Peter Fitzgerald for his opposition to the mayor 's cynical , the-people-be-damned scheme . <p> James D. Griffith , Wilmette <p> It was just announced again that millionaire Steve Fossett will attempt for a sixth time to balloon around the world solo . Ca n't this egomaniac find something better to do with his millions ? I know he has corporate sponsors , who should also be putting their millions elsewhere . <p> There are so many better causes and people in need in this world . Shame on them all . <p> Patricia Duffy , <p> Evergreen Park
