The soaring costs of higher education are reigniting interest in one of the easiest ways to work off a big chunk of college costs  --  doing chores in a housing cooperative . Little wonder , since the payoff can be spectacular . University of California-Los Angeles students , for example , can knock more than $6,700 off that school 's $24,000 total cost of attendance by living in an off-campus co-op and doing about five hours of chores a week . At that price , those chores pay , in effect , more than $39 an hour . Co-ops had fallen out of favor on many campuses in recent years because of their requirement that students do housework and their image as nests of lefties . But demand has rebounded as many co-ops have remade their images and financial necessity has forced more students to consider scrubbing their way through college . The North American Students of Cooperation , the biggest association of co-ops , has helped students launch them near the University of Virginia , Penn State , the University of Rochester , and Western Michigan University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NASCO 's director of asset management . He figures there are now at least 240 cooperative houses near at least 51 U.S. campuses . Demand . More may be on the way , even at campuses like the University of Florida in Gainesville . It shut down the last of its three campus co-ops in 2003 because the number of students interested in trading chores for savings would n't even fill a single house . Instead , says Sharon Blansett , an assistant housing director , the school had waiting lists for more expensive housing , such as single rooms and apartments . But now , thanks to rising educational costs and better recruiting , a foundation that runs low-cost co-ops for needy , high-achieving college students around Florida got four applicants for every bed and has a waiting list . Why are students clamoring for a chance to live in a group house that bans alcohol , is same-sex , and requires the students to maintain a B average and do chores ? Big savings . The nonprofit Southern Scholarship Foundation charges only $1,700 a school year for room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and meal plan cost about $7,000 . Teresa Turner , the foundation 's director of student affairs for central Florida , says that if demand keeps up like this , the foundation may build one or two more co-ops . Cooling off . Students , too , are spreading the word . Andrea Smith , a senior at Concordia University in Ann Arbor , Mich. , says friends at her Lutheran college said , " We 're going to pray for you over at that hippie house , " when she told them she was going to spend the summer at the Black Elk Cooperative . The independent co-op , near the University of Michigan campus , bills itself as " the vegetarian co-op that rocks . " Smith , who bills herself as conservative , says she " hardly agrees with anybody , but we get along , " especially because she and many other residents are studying art . She goes out to eat when she 's hungry for a hamburger and shrugs off house rules , such as one declaring upper floors " clothing optional . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to have that option . It gets hot . " ) She loves the savings and is planning to take what she 's learned about buying food in bulk and supporting local farmers back to Concordia in the fall , where she 'll help start a housing unit devoted to sustainable living . " I feel like I am trying to pave the way " to a more environmentally and financially friendly housing option , she says . Admittedly , some co-op chores are n't much fun . But Jessica Kaminsky , a freshman who last semester got stuck with one of the toilet-scrubbing jobs at Ohio State 's university-run Stadium Scholarship houses , said she did n't mind when she realized how much she 'd be saving  --  the equivalent of about $13.50 an hour . " There 's nothing wrong with working for your college education . And you definitely learn how to keep your house clean , " Kaminsky says . Other Ohio State co-op jobs are in higher demand . Some students get desk jobs that allow for plenty of studying . And some even get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game house parties . Unfortunately , there 's no central listing of campus co-ops , so interested students will have to do a little digging . If a campus housing office does n't offer a co-op option , many independent co-ops are listed at www.nasco.coop/guide . Information about Florida 's scholarship co-ops is at **37;3035;TOOLONG .
