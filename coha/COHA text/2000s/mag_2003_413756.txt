Learning to take a shooting rest while in the field ought to be Woodsmanship 101 for any hunter , but it is particularly critical for handgun hunters , who lack the benefit of a full stock with which to shoulder their firearm . Good shooting position technique will also help you steady up your shots . Here 's how . Go Prone As is true for riflemen , the most solid shooting position a handgun hunter can assume is the prone position . Lie on your belly while resting the handgun in front of you , preferably across something solid , like a log or a rock . A day pack or coat can also provide a steady rest . If your hands and firearm are resting on something solid , their movement is eliminated , which is the key to the shot . Now you just need to move your head until you get the proper sight alignment . Take a Seat Tall vegetation or the nature of the terrain itself often prevents the option of shooting prone . This is one reason why most shots taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While sitting is not as steady a position as lying prone , it is certainly the next best thing . When sitting , your legs are locked into place and your elbows are at the perfect height to brace against the insides of your knees . Sticks and Stones If you do n't mind carrying the extra weight , a bipod or a pair of shooting sticks can be invaluable . With a pair of shooting sticks , a hunter can concentrate on breathing and trigger control and not have to worry about finding a rest . Although heavier and more bulky , a bipod certainly has its place on a hunting handgun . The hunter equipped with one is always assured of a reliable , steady rest . Sturdy limbs , trees and rocks can serve as natural resting posts . Do n't let the gun itself touch the tree or rock , however , as the recoil from a centerfire handgun can cause the gun to glance off the post just enough for the bullet to fly astray . Use Your Knees Sometimes there are no trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due with the body God gave you . I remember one frosty morning when I called a coyote to the edge of a picked bean field . I was seated in a drainage ditch where there were no trees from which to " take a post , " and my shooting sticks were at home . I had to improvise . I slowly brought my knees together and wedged the trigger guard of my 9mm Beretta between them . The sights seemed steady on the coyote 's shoulder as he began to size up the situation from 35 steps away . I fired and the coyote fell . A tough shot had become a little easier with a makeshift rest and a solid shooting position . Those shooting heavier magnum revolvers should be very careful when trying this , however  --  the flash from the cylinder gap can be mighty hot . Anytime you 're using a body part for a handgun rest , keep safety in mind . Be wary of escaping flames and lead shards when shooting revolvers . Always keep your hands clear of the cylinder .
