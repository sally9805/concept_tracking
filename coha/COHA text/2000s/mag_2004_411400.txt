You , too , can follow the popular Atkins diet // After years of being thwarted in her attempts to remove meat from her diet by parents who considered such a regimen unhealthy , Eva Katz began her freshman year at New Jerseys Rutgers University as , at long last , a vegetarian . Katz assumed that a meatless diet would be a healthier way of life . Instead , the normally energetic nutrition major and New Jersey native soon noticed that she often felt sluggish and tired . " My roommate was a vegetarian , " Katz says . " She ate a lot of french fries , rice and pasta , and she was overweight . I never felt good when I ate those foods , but in the dining hall , pastas were what was offered as the vegetarian choice , and back then , there was a huge push toward low-fat foods . " And Katz , too , gained weight . One day , a fellow student told Katz , " You should be watching your carbs . " Then he told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said it was the Atkins diet . The diet , which has four phases , calls for limited carbohydrates-ranging from 20 grams to 120 grams daily depending on the phase of the diet and the individual-and higher amounts of fat and protein . ( Standard recommendations call for about 300 grams of carbohydrates daily . ) The History Robert Atkins , MD , first introduced his low-carbohydrate diet in 1972 with his book Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution . Thirty years later , the book remains on best seller lists and has been joined by a second best seller , Atkins for Life . The Atkins diet has spawned not only coundess odier low-carbohydtate diets but also the creation of low-carbohydrate foods and an ongoing debate over the merits of low-fat versus low-carb diets . Critics of low-carbohydrate diets say that the diets are unbalanced , that they restrict healthful foods that provide essential nutrients and that they are overly dependent on meat because low-carb diets are often highprotein diets . It is this last point that has led many to believe that a meatless , low-carbohydrate diet is an oxymoron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Katz , now a 29year-old registered dietitian with a masters degree in public health , decided to try a low-carb diet anyway . While she never followed the meatheavy Atkins diet plan , she says , " Reading the book made me more aware of the effect of carbohydrates on my blood sugar and the nutritional quality of food . I reduced my carbohydrate intake and began selecting more nutrient-dense foods . I tried eating more nuts and cheese and focused on natural unprocessed foods , like leafy , green vegetables and fruits . I stayed away from starchier vegetables , like white potatoes , corn and peas . " Before long , Katz lost the weight she had gained in college . Even more important , she says , she felt better . Since discovering the Atkins diet book , Katz has continued to eat a vegetarian diet low in carbohydrates , and , for the past 4 years , she 's been the coordinator of education and research for the Atkins Health &; Medical Information Services in New York , a division of the Atkins corporation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods that are both vegetarian and low carbohydrate is n't difficult for a lacto-ovo vegetarian , Katz says , though it may be more difficult for a vegan . On a typical day , Katz 's breakfast includes eggs , cottage cheese or yogurt and fresh fruit . For lunch , she 'll have a salad with protein-tofu , beans , eggs or seeds-and a dressing such as oil and vinegar . For dinner , she 'll eat cooked vegetables , a serving of protein , a piece of fruit , such as an avocado , and barley or brown rice . Between meals , she snacks on cheese , fruit or nuts , but she generally eats only one slice of bread per day and only whole grain bread . A vegetarian diet alone does n't guarantee good health , Katz says . You have to choose vegetarian foods wisely . " Just because chips are vegetarian does n't mean you should eat them every day . People turn to vegetarian diets to lose weight or to feel better , but that 's not the result you get if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods the right foods ? Low-carbohydrate foods are typically dense in nutrients and higher in proteins and fiber , which means they take longer to digest , therefore allowing the person to feel satisfied for a longer period of time . Low-carbohydrate foods also generally rate low on the glycemic index , a tool that measures a food 's effect on blood sugar . High glycemic foods cause the blood sugar to surge then plummet , creating a craving for more carbohydrates . Low glycemic foods , by contrast , arc usually low in carbohydrates and high in fiber and have less of an impact on blood sugar . " When you eat foods lower in carbohydrates , you tend to burn the fat you are eating as well as your body fat , " Katz says . " When you eat foods high in carbohydrates , the body burns the carbohydrates and stores fat . There 's a misconception that eating fat makes you fat , but when you eat high carbohydrates , your body can take the extra carbohydrates and make them into fat . " Not So Fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest distortions of the truth promoted by high-protein diet advocates is that protein causes little or no increase in production of insulin , " writes John McDougall , MD , founder and medical director of the McDougall Wellness Center in Santa Rosa , California . Citing research published in The American Journal of Cardiology , McDougall says that the healthiest way to reduce insulin resistance and lower insulin levels is with exercise plus a diet high in complex carbohydrates and low in fat . " This approach corrects the underlying causes of the resistance . " Suzanne Havala Hobbs , RD , health science writer and adjunct assistant professor in the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , says that little rigorous attention has been given to questions about the longterm effects of low-carb , high-protein diets . " While it may be gratifying , and sometimes medically beneficial , to lose weight in the short term , most of us make life plans for the long term . None of us would choose to marry or have children based on goals set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diets should reflect our thinking about lifelong health and wellness objectives , " she says about the lack of long-term studies on the health effects of low-carb diets . Diana Mirkin , cooking instructor and co-author with her husband , Gabe Mirkin , MD , of The Healthy Heart Miracle , says that while the low-carbohydrate diet may sound good in theory , a vegetarian low-carbohydrate diet is a contradiction in terms . " The typical vegetarian protein source is rice , beans , barley and lentils , " Mirkin says . " If you are on a low-carbohydrate diet , those foods are not on your list of options , so you are going to be driven to meat substitutes , such as soy turkey and soy pepperoni . It 's not an easy or healthy way long term to meet your protein needs . You ca n't have a wide , plantbased foods diet and avoid carbohydrates at the same time . " Katz says , however , that one should never confuse a low-carbohydrate diet with a no-carbohydrate diet . " It 's not tliat you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to focus more on vegetables , protein , fats and oils . Brown rice , barley and beans are perfectly acceptable . " And soy products do n't have to be your only protein source , Katz says . " You have eggs , nuts , seeds , cheese and other dairy sources . all of diose foods are acceptable . " The Challenge Cindy Moore , MS , RD , spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association , says that it 's possible to follow a low-carbohydrate vegetarian diet and that such a diet can be healthful . But , she asks , is it worth the trouble ? " Anytime you are adding more limitations to a vegetarian diet , it increases the challenges . The tenets of a vegetarian diet are to utilize fruits , vegetables and whole grains . Following a low-carb diet is certainly not going to be harmful , but I do n't think it 's necessarily going to be more healthful , just more challenging , " Moore says . Although a vegetarian who eats dairy products will likely have no problem consuming enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply not practical for vegans . " They may not be able to meet their calorie needs and so may not be able to maintain body weight . The other issue is how much stress are you willing to put yourself through to follow this regimen . If it becomes difficult to follow this regimen when you are in social situations , is it worth it ? " Advice on what constitutes a healthful diet varies , but Katz , Moore and Mirkin agree that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is the best way to go . " The right message , " says Mirkin , " is to eat a wide variety of foods , with a strong emphasis on plants . The more colors , the more types of plants you can include , the better . That 's the message we think should be at the top of every diet theory .
