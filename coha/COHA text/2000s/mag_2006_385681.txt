. Overrun by crooks we ca n't find , much less convict , the Web is under siege . The only way to save it is to rebuild it  --  and this time , give it an immune system . WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS when you connect your computer to the Internet ? In less than an hour , it may not be yours anymore . While you 're Googling your name and checking e-mail , a hacker , perhaps in Eastern Europe  --  let 's call him Ivan  --  quietly takes over your machine . There are a dozen ways Ivan could do it , but he probably found you with a program he did n't get at Best Buy called a port scanner , which roams the Internet like a clumsy cat burglar , trying every doorknob until it locates one left unlocked . Then he makes a connection to your computer  --  sort of like starting a chat session , only invisible to you  --  and uses it to deliver a " backdoor , " a small piece of code that lets him take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know it , but you 've just become part of a " botnet , " a small army of computers that Ivan will rent to international organized-crime rings , which will use it to spew spam , steal identities , or hold corporate Web sites hostage ( not to mention slow down your PC ) . Sound like a scare story ? It happens to more than 300,000 computers each day  --  PCs connected to the Internet without security precautions such as a firewall , anti-virus software or an up-to-date operating system . According to the FBI , $67.2 billion was lost last year to online crime . Sure , there are ways to fight back see " Five Things You Can Do Today to Protect Yourself , " page 88 , shutting down " zombies " ( PCs surreptitiously controlled by hackers ) and prosecuting the handful of Ivans the police have managed to catch . But it 's like playing a huge game of whack-a-mole . Knock the criminals over the head in one spot , and they pop up someplace else . " No matter what solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five minutes to get around it , " says Lance Spitzner , president of the nonprofit volunteer Honeynet Project , which sets out vulnerable computers as bait so researchers can study attackers ' behavior . " The creativity of cyber-criminals is amazing . " Fact is , the system is easy to game because it was never designed to be secure . The Internet was created 40 years ago so university geeks could share research , not so you could buy baubles on eBay . As companies developed ingenious ways to build security into things like online credit-card transactions , hackers came up with equally ingenious ways to get around it , launching a security arms race that Ivan and his comrades are so far winning . If we want to fight back , we need a new approach , something that fundamentally changes the way computers interact with the Internet and how the Internet functions . Companies and organizations all over the world are working on these kinds of long-term solutions , but one of the most radical ideas is being developed at Carnegie Mellon University 's CyLab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 , CyLab has 70 faculty researchers and 140 graduate students at its Pittsburgh campus , with satellite facilities in Korea and Japan . Its approach is to make the Internet function like a biological entity that wards off attacks the way a healthy body fights off a cold  --  in other words , to build a network with an immune system . " Unless we move toward that goal , we 'll just spend all our time solving new problems , " says Pradeep Khosla , dean of Carnegie Mellon 's college of engineering and co-director of CyLab . You ca n't build something that 's perfectly secure , so you make something that can survive the attacks you can anticipate , making it harder and more expensive for criminals to do their thing . Even Fort Knox could be taken , but it would require a small army to do it , which would cut heavily into the bad guys ' profits . CyLab has dozens of projects at various stages of development ; many are years from implementation and would cost billions of dollars to put in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finding their sources  --  are necessary medicine for an Internet that 's getting sicker by the minute . REMEDY 1 : CREATE DIVERSITY ON YOUR DESKTOP Make software and operating systems that evolve when attacked , so the same trick does n't work on so many computers In June 2004 , Internet-security researchers discovered a vulnerability in Internet Explorer 6 that could let attackers take over your computer when you visited an infected Web site . The attack exploited a flaw in how IE 6 managed security , fooling the browser into thinking that malicious code was running in a so-called " trusted zone " on your local machine instead of on the Internet . Once a machine was infected , the attackers could do anything they pleased  --  erase files , install a key-logger to steal bank-account information , or turn the computer into a zombie . The problem was so bad that the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team , a division of the Department of Homeland Security , advised Web surfers to stop using IE until Microsoft issued a patch , which it did in August of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of IE 6 contained the same flaw , the attackers had tens of millions of potential targets . " The reason the human race is so robust is that there 's diversity in the gene pool , " Khosla says . " The problem with software is that every version has the same damned bugs . " Researchers at CyLab are studying how plants and animals evolve in response to disease , hoping to emulate those processes by building software that adapts when attacked . If some copies of Explorer " evolved " to resist the attack , hackers would soon give up and go looking for easier targets . Taking the idea one step further , CyLab imagines creating programs or entire operating systems that would randomly change the way they functioned as they operated or that would execute instructions in a different order every time . For example , each copy of IE might use a slightly different method of determining security zones . The difficulty lies in replicating enough of the code so that every application does the same thing , without replicating its vulnerabilities , says CyLab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might begin to see programs like this in three to five years . " Why do we have epidemics ? " Khosla says . " Not because there are germs out there . It 's because we ca n't control their propagation . You ca n't stop the dissemination of viruses and worms , but you can reduce their speed of propagation . " REMEDY 2 : BOOST DATA IMMUNE SYSTEMS Protect corporate databases so they ca n't be stolen from , and the networks around them so they ca n't be brought down for ransom Eran Reshef thought he 'd figured out a clever way to combat spam . The CEO of Israeli company Blue Security created a method of flooding junk e-mailers and their clients with opt-out requests  --  essentially , spamming the spammers . Within a few months , Reshef claimed , six of the world 's biggest junk e-mailers had agreed to stop spamming his customers . Then , this past May , a Russian spammer known as PharmaMaster fought back . Using a botnet , he launched what 's called a distributed denial of service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access a Web site at the same time , it overwhelms the servers that host the site and shuts it down . DDOS attacks do this relentlessly , keeping a company 's site offline until it agrees to pay a ransom . And PharmaMaster did n't stop there . He took down Blue Security 's blog service , its Internet service provider , and the security firm it hired to repel the original attack . Then he sent Blue Security 's customers e-mails infected with a virus . After two weeks of relentless attacks , Blue Security just gave up . At press time , Bluesecurity.com was still offline . ( Reshef declined to be interviewed for this article . ) Nobody knows how many of these attacks occur every year , because few companies admit to being attacked for fear of revealing their weaknesses . Today DDOS attacks are largely fought by redirecting the enormous amount of traffic to servers that can handle it . Often companies hire firms that specialize in such defense . Someday , these attacks could be solved by self-healing networks that can continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head cold . But such systems are still years away from being built in the lab , let alone deployed on the Internet . CyLab is n't even working on them yet . But if they ca n't yet protect a network from being attacked , they can at least protect the large databases of information  --  say , a bank 's customer records  --  behind those networks . A version of these so-called survivable data-storage systems is in place at CyLab today . One way to think about CyLab 's system is to imagine a database as a sheet of paper . If you tear the paper into 1,000 differently shaped pieces and store them in 1,000 different places , you make it harder to steal . But if an attacker finds and destroys just one piece , you ca n't reconstruct the paper . If you make four copies of the paper , though , cut each copy into 1,000 different pieces , and store all the pieces on 1,000 different computers , you 've made the target so big and elusive that an attacker ca n't possibly take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there are copies of every bit of data , the system itself can replace any compromised pieces . " An attacker would have to take down 80 percent of your computers to bring the system down , " Khosla says . " Even if you 're under a massive attack , it wo n't totally die . " REMEDY 3 : FIND THE SOURCE OF INFECTIONS Fix the backbone of the Internet so criminals ca n't hide their tracks Diagnosing anthrax or another infectious disease is easy ; the hard part is finding where it came from . Today 's Internet has a similar problem : Malware is easy to spot , but its origin is often a mystery . Information travels around the Internet in data packets , each one with an Internet Protocol ( IP ) address , a 12-digit number that indicates from which machine it originated . Unfortunately , it 's easy to " spoof , " or fake , the IP address to hide the data 's actual source . ( There are even legal tools you can use to hide your computer 's IP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) CyLab 's Fast Internet Traceback ( FIT ) technology can follow each packet as it moves across the Internet , " like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs , " says Adrian Perrig , assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon . With FIT , each packet would get a small marker added to it as it passed through a router , a machine that directs and relays Internet traffic . These markers would allow computer-forensics experts to identify the routers through which a packet had passed , ultimatel tracing it back to the computer that originally sent the data  --  whether it belonged to Ivan , a botnet or a teenager just causing trouble  --  and choke it off . But for FIT to work , Perrig estimates , at least a third of the Internet 's roughly 100,000 routers must be upgraded , a process that would take many years and cost billions of dollars . Even then , tracing packets would get you only so far , says Bruce Schneier , founder of California-based consultancy Counterpane Internet Security . " It 's easy to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get from your computer to you , " he explains . That is , the chain of evidence breaks once you try to prove that it was Ivan 's fingers on the keyboard . You need some way to absolutely verify his identity , such as authentication and biometrics . But this , in turn , raises serious privacy concerns . Do you really want Uncle Sam or your boss to be able to pinpoint where you go on the Internet ? What if you 're a political dissident in Iran or China ? CyLab has policy experts who deal with these types of issues , which may prove harder to solve than the technical ones , given the international nature of the Internet . Achieving a survivable , self-healing Internet will be difficult  --  but not impossible . " If you want to eradicate disease from this earth , the problem is insurmountable , " Khosla says . " But if you want to eradicate smallpox , polio , measles or malaria , each problem is very difficult , but on their own , none are insurmountable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media ; 2005 ) . BOX THREE KEY FACTS 1 Unprotected computers can quickly become " zombie " PCs , remotely controlled by hackers for criminal purposes . 2 Carnegie Mellon University 's CyLab is looking to biological principles like evolution for ways to better secure the Internet. 3 Much of the fraud and identity theft on the Internet today stems from organized crime in other countries . BOX WHO ARE THESE CRIMINALS ? MEET THE Internet 's new bad guys . Where once " script kiddies "  --  young amateur hackers  --  wrote viruses just to cause havoc and show off their skills , they 're now building " zombie farms "  --  armies of PCs controlled from afar  --  and renting them out to the highest bidder on underground forums you 'd never find with a Google search . Increasingly , they 're being hired by organized crime syndicates to steal identities and hold corporate Web sites hostage . " Ten years ago we talked about the Internet as the Wild West , " says Peter Swire , a law professor at Ohio State University and a former top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more like gangland Chicago in the 1920s . The threats come from organized crime , not lone cowboys . " These cyber-crooks may be dispersed across the globe , each with his own specialty . " This is not your traditional La Cosa Nostra type of organized crime , " says Dan Larkin , unit chief for the FBI 's Cyber Initiative and Resource Fusion Unit in Pittsburgh . " In many cases , they do n't know each other personally , just by trade and screen name . " These gangs in turn may be linked to criminal groups in Eastern Europe , West Africa and South America , Larkin adds . And although international cooperation is steadily improving , he says , pursuing and prosecuting cyber-criminals thousands of miles away remains an enormous challenge . If a criminal lives in Eastern Europe and the local authorities have more important crimes to deal with , there 's not much that can be done , admits Jody Westby , CEO of Global Cyber Risk , a Washington , D.C.-based security consultancy . And what might be illegal in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders , but law-enforcement agencies and diplomats do , " she says . Worse , international crime outfits are beginning to pool their efforts , making them even more of a threat , Westby says . " The Nigerians , who are expert at taking over accounts , are cooperating with the Chinese , who are expert at counterfeiting . We 're facing a more sophisticated criminal operating environment , yet we 've not gotten more sophisticated in our ability to catch them . They have an advantage , there 's no question .

Then change the network name ( also known as the SSID ) , turn on the firewall , and enable encryption ( you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WPA is better ) . 2 Check your router 's settings to see if it has a network address translator ( NAT ) , and if not , upgrade to one that does ( most routers sold today do ) , and use that to connect to the Internet . The NAT makes your PC invisible to port scans , the most common way to find unprotected machines . 3 Accept the system updates Microsoft sends . As new vulnerabilities to Windows XP are found , Microsoft creates patches , but you need to turn on automatic updating ( or download them manually ) to install them . Although there are fewer threats to Macs , the same rule applies : Keep your system updated . 4 Get a security-software suite such as Computer Associates 's eTrust , which combines a firewall with protection against viruses , spyware , spam and other threats . Your Internet service provider may offer one . If it does n't , buy one yourself and keep it updated .
