ContentsSCHEHEREZADE 'S RARE AND USED BOOKS # ( In memory of Robert Cormier ) <p> DEAR F : <p> I am , primarily , a reader . No , let 's be factual  --  I am only a reader . In all other things , I have been , let 's confess , an abject failure . As husband , father , son , brother , friend , lover , I have been a consistent disappointment . In the last letter you called me a " writer " and I reared back upon reading the word . <p> I am a correspondent . No more and no less . And I come from a time when this was known to be a different avocation from " writing . " While both writer and correspondent wish to make contact , the purpose of that contact differs with each role . With each state of being . <p> But today , on this one and only occasion , I do have a story to tell . Whether or not you believe the story is not my concern . I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain open-minded and attentive . At such a late date , is this too much to ask ? <p> We must start the story with a disclaimer . We must offer up my motivations for what will be , very likely , my final letter . Yes , the worst has been confirmed . The third and most vigorous course of chemotherapy has failed . In some perverse and utterly characteristic way , it is a relief . No more plastic bags of useless fluids leaking into my veins day and night . No more thumbing through dense ( and badly written ) journals for the latest news about acute myelocytic leukemia . I checked myself out of St. John the Divine last night over the outrage of a physician young enough to be my grandson . It was as if my choice to die far from the sterility of the hospital were an affront to his newly minted degree . The young have not read enough , my friend . <p> But look at whom I aim my windy summations . For years now you have read all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now more than ever , how much this has meant to me . No one could guess the nature of our connection . And soon there will be only one primary source available to the historians . The blood on this page fell from my nose . Not an encouraging sign , but I wo n't tear up the sheet and start again . Time is simply too precious . <p> So now that you know the context , I will pass on to you all that I have to bequeath . The last tale and the best . Librarians and book clerks are not known for the enormity of the estates they leave behind . But , if they can identify the appropriate heirs , there is usually a legacy to be passed down , an antique or two of some value . Take this story with my thanks and my blessing . Perhaps one day you will tell it in my memory . <p> In my youth , there was a time when I was obsessed with playing cards . At the de Sale School I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no great boast , however . I came of age too late , at a time when boys had , by and large , abandoned the love of a long card game . The art of the deal and the play and the bluff was no longer inculcated in the young . After the first few times I cleaned out the rare poker enthusiasts on campus , no one wanted to go to the green felt with me . I was left to a dozen variations of solitaire and , more importantly , manipulation . <p> I believe at some point I have written of my boyhood enthrallment with sleight-of-hand magic . My interest began with a young fan 's appreciation for the Masters  --  Arthur Lloyd , Herbert Brooks , the great Archie Tear . In due course I began to emulate my idols and found that I had a ) . the long , tapered fingers that are made for such a skill and b ) . the infinite patience and the love of repetition and the satisfaction of my own company that allows for the kind of endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into art . I trained compulsively , to the detriment of my studies and my friendships , but before long I could handle a Greek Shuffle or a Mongolian Crimp with the nonchalance of a professional . I could palm and riffle , spring and jog in my sleep . I had two Svengali decks , one of which had been made in London by Elmsley himself ( or so the salesman told me ) . I amazed my dormitory mates with a slew of vintage tricks , all of which were new to these rubes . They sat in the hallway late into the night , sipping their tonics and trying not to blink , their backs rigid against the ancient horsehair plaster as I led them like lemmings through the O'Henry and the Gemini , through Liar Liar and the King 's Robbery . <p> I wo n't go into the details of my downfall at the school . Suffice it to say that I fell prey to the magician 's oldest temptation . The audience 's adulation and frustration were not enough for me . Soon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love wagering on illusion . And I was young enough to think I could strip them of daddy 's allowance without repercussion . That I spent the money on an Oriental stripper deck with its own enamel case only further annoyed the dean of discipline and it was upon receipt of his letter that my sister , my legal guardian , summoned me home to the Capital . <p> So , that morning , boarding the train out of Quinsigamond , I thought I would calm myself with hours of one-handed shuffling , making Jacks vanish from sight , as I pondered ways to explain and excuse my expulsion . <p> I was riding the old Portland-Columbia line  --  this was just a few years before it went bust . My train , the Seaboard Star , once the showcase of a more tasteful era , was showing evidence of extreme fatigue . The stained glass in the solarium was cracked and the brass moldings in the dining car were tarnished beyond any hope of a future gleam . These signs of obsolescence combined with the disgrace of my dismissal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me a premier case of the blues . So , as I found my seat in the last economy coach ( car 29  --  I 've never forgotten ) , I set at once to my favorite cure-all . I put my duffel between my legs and began to rummage for a deck . And I came up empty . <p> Shocked , I pulled open the mouth of the bag until the seams were ready to burst and searched again . My hand grabbed blindly , fondling sweatshirts and dirty socks , but I soon knew the truth . There were no cards to be found . In my haste to disappear from the campus , I had forgotten to pack even a single deck . I ca n't convey how unsettling this discovery was . I always kept a deck within reach . The cards had become a kind of talisman for me , a calming instrument , unconsciously handled in the way others finger prayer beads or pill bottles . <p> It 's true , I could have marched down to the club car and purchased a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reimburse my marks with interest and I was suddenly experiencing some severe economic difficulties . I had only enough money for either a skimpy lunch or one of the train 's horribly flimsy souvenir decks  --  the ones that sport a line drawing of a locomotive . The trip was a ten-hour ride . Though I knew that my stomach would carry the day , still , my decision , though logical , was an insult to what I saw as my calling . And so , though I knew it was futile , I allowed myself some angry rummaging before I resigned myself to my fate . <p> That was when Klingman approached me . Let me take a moment to describe the man 's face as that first glimpse remains with me , just as clear , to this day . I know that I overestimated his age , a common mistake for a schoolboy . At that time , age had only two demographic categories : Youth , someone such as myself , an aspiring magician with all the time needed to learn the conjuring arts . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Klingman was , I would now guess , no more than fifty years old . His skin , however , was already giving in to the cruelties of gravity if not sunlight ( he was not an outdoorsman and , today , I might speculate that he was anemic ) . He was short and round , a pear-shaped lump of dough . He had bushy gray eyebrows , purple caverns below the eyes . There was a long-faded scar on the bottom of his chin . Sea-green eyes and a badly cut monk 's crown of hair . There were liver spots speckling his dome . He needed a shave and a conscientious barber would have trimmed the nose hair without waiting to be asked . He wore wire-rimmed glasses of the old variety , round lenses with either a rust-colored or industrial silver frame . <p> His clothes were an indignity , I thought at that time , when I was as stylish as I was arrogant . But Klingman was surely unaware of this humiliation . I can see the worn , dark suit that smelled like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellowed handkerchief was pushed up one sleeve . I know he wore his faded white shirt open at the neck and there was a ribbed undershirt beneath . <p> He said to me , " Did you lose something ? " in a tone too concerned and friendly . Too informal , as if he were an uncle I 'd known since birth . <p> I looked at him without responding , one hand still thrust in my duffel , though I already knew there was no hope of retrieving any cards . <p> Klingman stood in the aisle staring at me as I stared back . A woman turned sideways and shimmied past him . She was carrying a sleeping baby . I remember the infant was dressed in white lace . <p> " Because , " he said , " I could lend you one of mine . " And with that he positioned himself and lowered his bulk into the seat next to mine . Trust me when I tell you he was not a naturally coordinated man . <p> My mood went from disappointed to suspicious with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his lap an oversized valise made , I swear to you , of some sort of imitation red leather . It was cracked and torn and he opened it delicately . <p> " Nothing worse , " he said , " than being caught on a long train ride without your book . " <p> " I was looking , " I said , delivering the words with what I hoped was the right combination of contempt and apathy , " for a deck of cards . " <p> " You are a card player ? " he asked and I waited a beat for emphasis before blowing a heavy gust of air out my nose and giving my head the tiniest shake . This greasy bumpkin was the last thing I needed . I was about to speed toward my sister 's fury for three days of debate about my attitude and my future . <p> " My father was a card player , " he said . " Do you know the game My Aunt , Your Aunt ? " <p> This brought me up short . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , understand , it had already fallen through the cracks of popular entertainment . It was a complicated affair , requiring both a good memory and an actor 's instincts . Some real money could be made during a night with the Aunts . But I 'd never before met anyone who was an informed player . <p> I sat in my seat and gave him a smile . I said , " You would n't have a deck of cards in there ? " indicating his bag . <p> At this he laughed . <p> " Cards ? " he said in a put-on voice and made a little show of opening the valise and bringing his head down to its mouth . " No , no cards in here , " as if I were a child in need of amusement . At that moment I thought him less the hick and more likely an Old Mavis , as we called them at de Sale . <p> He rooted in the valise and I thought for a second he was mocking me , imitating my search through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two books , both paperbacks . He held one in each hand and hefted them a bit as if trying to guess the weight of each . As he did this , he pushed out his bottom lip , which gave him a moronic , unevolved look . The books appeared old and second-hand . The spines were both broken and peeled in so many places that you could no longer read the titles . <p> " A difficult decision , " he muttered , it seemed , to himself . " Always , a tricky choice . " <p> He let his head fall back against the fibrous white paper that protected the headrest and closed his eyes , then his left arm jerked sideways and presented me with one of the books . <p> Today , it interests me that I tried to decline the gift . I shook my head but his eyes were still closed , so I was forced to say , " No thanks . " <p> " It 's a long trip , " he said with an annoying , sing-song delivery . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew where I was headed . It was n't an express train . There were a dozen or more stops before we would arrive at the Capital . <p> " I 'm not much of a reader , " I said . <p> " That , " as his eyes opened , " is a shame . But not a tragedy . Do you know why ? " <p> I did n't want to have a conversation but I did n't know how to make this clear without being rude . And so I set out immediately to be rude . I pushed my seat back in a reclining position , turned away from the man and made as if to nap . <p> Of course he continued talking . <p> " Because this is something you can change . This is a condition you can alter at once . Without too much difficulty . " <p> I felt the book tap my arm , rolled forward and looked at him . <p> " Hey , mister , " I said , " give me a break . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took the book from him . I turned it over in my hands and studied the cover . To say that it was striking would give the wrong impression , call up , I think , notions of color and flash . This was not at all the case , more the opposite I would say , but the design did intrigue me and made me want to discover what was inside . <p> The title of the novel was Refugee , the word written in large , black type . Many years later , it occurred to me to attempt to replicate the presentation of the title on the page . I spent weeks with a felt pen and a sketchpad , but , as you know , I am no artist and when I took my rendering to a designer acquaintance , she offered several possibilities as to the typography . I looked up all of her speculations and the one that seemed to come closest to my memory of the title on the page was known as " Urban Remington . " It approximates an old typewriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design was an uneven distribution of the ink , some letters darker than others , but all in the utilitarian blockiness of a manual typewriter dating from mid-century . <p> I had an instantaneous attraction to the illustration below the title . I can no longer recall whether it was a photograph or an artist 's rendering , but if the latter , it was done in an extreme style of photo-realism . It was precise and detailed . Perhaps I did not know at first glance if it were photo or painting . It had something of a sepia quality to it , though it was surely in color , mostly muted browns and blues . <p> What shall I describe for you first ? It would be simple to say the cover featured a young man on a highway . But while technically accurate , I fear this would instill precisely the wrong impression . The " young man " is more an adolescent forced into an early maturity . Yet , how can I say that I knew this on first glance since the figure was depicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye ? The " highway " was actually an older , two-lane road , nothing like the interstate monsters of our own age . There was no traffic . There were no reflective-green road signs . No gas stations . No halogen lamps rising into the clouds . The landscape was pastoral the road was framed by forests of bare trees , stark with the autumn season . The young traveler carried a sailor 's tote . He was attired as a working man , in blue jeans , a coat of leather or canvas , boots . He approached a covered bridge , partly shrouded in mist , set in the distance , in the upper right-side of the cover , just below the last " e " of the title . <p> Now , the first oddity that should have been evident was the absence of an author 's name anywhere on the cover . But I failed to realize this until I finished reading the novel . <p> After studying the cover , I attempted to hand the book back to its owner , who was busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finally sat back and saw the extended book , he waved it away , saying , " Trust me , you 'll like it . " <p> " I told you , " I countered , " I 'm not a reader . I do n't want it . " <p> He smiled and let his head give a series of fast , patriarchal nods . <p> " Yes , " he said , " I heard you . You do not read . You do not like books . I hear it quite often . " <p> But still he would not take the book from me . Instead he pulled in a phlegmy breath and said , " You keep the book . No need to read it if you do n't want . But just in case you change your mind . " <p> " I 'm not going to change my mind , " I said , more loudly than I intended . <p> " You give it to me at the end of the trip . " <p> " I do n't  --  " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and made a shushing sound as if trying to quiet an infant . <p> I was caught so completely off-guard that I canceled the end of my protest and he said , " You know , if I remember correctly , there 's a wonderful card playing chapter someplace near the middle . " <p> I stared at the man and decided to walk away . I got out of my seat and saved it with my duffel , tucked the book into my back pocket and walked toward the club car , fuming . By this time , the train was ready to pull out of the local station and I 'll confess that the knowledge that I was leaving de Sale for the last time inflamed my regret and my sense of shame . I had experienced as many happy as sad days on the hill and since my parents ' accident , it was the closet thing I had to a home . The thought of living with my sister was as unappealing to me as it was to her husband . So , as I wormed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unknown future came to me in the form of a subtle panic . <p> When a seat opened near the window , I raced for it against someone 's dog-faced grandmother and claimed it without any remorse . The bitter righteousness of the orphan and all . The table was littered with the remains of the previous occupant 's breakfast , a small lake of spilled coffee and powdered sugar . I mopped and brushed with a napkin and looked out the window at the decrepit , ash-covered landscape of mills and row houses that had come to represent New England to me . <p> We picked up speed slowly and the train occasionally lurched , but for the most part there was a steady , nap-inducing sway to the motion that produced in me a kind of low-grade trance , a state perpetually on the border of sleep , but never crossing fully into that territory . When the waiter finally arrived , he had to grunt to signal his presence . I ordered a cherry soda and he immediately launched into a bored , well rehearsed explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I asked for a corn muffin to go with the soda and the man gave me a dismissive look and moved off toward the galley . <p> Everyone else in the car seemed in high spirits , dressed up for travel and looking forward to reuniting with a distant clan . The sound of all this anticipated happiness made me more fearful than angry and I suddenly wished I had taken one of the interstate bus lines with their bad ventilation and horrific toilets . <p> I leaned back into the booth and felt Klingman 's book press against my coccyx . And then came , depending on your point of view , the moment of my redemption or my damnation . <p> I 'm sorry to be so melodramatic , my confrere . But I know , beyond any possibility of doubt or confusion , that this moment , this simple action , the basic kinetics of my arm reaching behind my back and extracting the book , that this was the moment when my life jumped tracks and veered wildly in a new direction . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to read his story . Within a paragraph , the train began to vanish and the world of the refugee began to assert itself into my consciousness with such power and clarity that I was helpless in its presence . <p> At some point , I assume , I paid for and ate my muffin . But I did so without thought or taste . At some point , the club car must have emptied of its breakfast customers and filled with a lunch crowd , disposed of the sandwich eaters and swelled with the supper shift . For reasons I still do not understand all these years later , no one bothered me . No one disturbed the universe of my reading . Not even my surly breakfast waiter . <p> You want , at this point , some sense of the novel . I 'm hesitant to even attempt such a gift . In the end , it 's a cheat , is n't it ? At best , I 'd be offering the shadow of the experience . Which is to say , I 'd be offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , try to track down the novel and read it yourself . Let me save you the effort . You 'll never find it . I know this as surely as I know my own name . And even if you could locate a copy , your experience of the book could never be my experience . Have you never heard the saying , the reader creates his own book ? <p> But for the sake of my story , let me write that the novel was a Bildungsroman . A coming of age tale . The protagonist was a boy my own age and , if you can believe it , also an orphan . The title referred to his sense of unbelonging and chronic displacement . The boy wandered the country , chapter to chapter , region to region . At one point , he even rode the rails , as I was doing . The hero worked odd jobs along the road . He met fascinating characters and had all manner of adventures . <p> Am I making the novel sound like a lark , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dark tale , there was a sense of the ominous and the morose on every page . More than any plot-driven danger that befell the boy , there was at the heart of the narrative an aura of foreboding evoked by the prose itself . And in the end , the hero remained the refugee of the title , still unsettled , still unembraced . After all those pages , the boy continued to live as a wanderer and stranger in the land of his birth . <p> I finished the book two stops before we pulled into the Capital . The sun had gone down . My backside was in a state of advanced paralysis . I had n't eaten since breakfast and my bladder was on the verge of rupture . <p> I want to write this as precisely as I am capable because it will inform your sense of my entire story : when I finished that book , I felt as if I had been remade . I felt as if I had been changed into another person somehow . As if my consciousness had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refocused , trained to think , to imagine , in an entirely new manner . <p> I closed the book and tried to stand and stumbled on my sleeping legs . I used the table tops as crutches and made my way to the rest room where I urinated for some record-breaking span of time . I splashed my face and neck with water . And then , instinctively , I ran to find Klingman . <p> My duffel was on my seat where I had left it , but Klingman was not in the adjoining chair . I looked up and down the aisles . No Klingman . I thought of searching the Seaboard Star , car by car , from coach to first class . But before I could begin , the train began to move again . And as it pulled out of the station , I saw the old man outside , seated on a wooden bench on the boarding platform . He was staring at me , smiling . He brought one hand away from the book he was reading and gave me a single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought my face to the window and watched him recede and grow smaller . I stood there , one knee resting on my seat , my arm above my head braced against the window , until Klingman disappeared from my sight . And in the instant that he vanished , I was overcome with a sense of what I now swear was pure grief . <p> I have come to know grief all too well and too often in my life . As anyone my age has . Grief is what age insists on teaching us . And the sensation of utter loss I experienced in that train car , watching a stranger fade into the distance , was akin to the dispossession and the cold sorrow I had felt when my parents were killed on an icy highway in Manitoba . <p> I think I might have dissolved into tears had I not felt the hand on my shoulder . I jumped and turned to find my breakfast waiter smiling at me . Fie removed his hand but I could n't bring myself to ask what he wanted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're welcome . ' " <p> I cringe again as I write this because on the page it may read a presumptuous statement . But I have never doubted that the message contained anything but genuine warmth and good wishes . <p> The waiter moved on and left my car . I sank into my seat and held the book in my lap as if it were a fragile pet . For the rest of my trip I looked from the book cover to the countryside passing my window . My mind was empty and exhausted and my entire body was chilled . I knew , sensed , that something had happened to me but I could not begin to understand what it was . <p> When we arrived at the Capital , I pushed the book into my duffel and buttoned my coat . I was the last to exit the train . My sister and her husband were waiting for me . For some reason , they were both dressed formally , as if on their way to an opera . They had the same tired , dour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate groveling  --  enough so that I 'd embarrass myself without making a scene . And honestly , I would have complied but I was tired enough to collapse . <p> I followed them to the parking garage and climbed into the back of their sedan for the drive to the country house where we were to spend the holiday . Under the guise of weary concern , my sister lectured me the entire way , grounding all of her many opinions regarding my character m the disappointment and disgrace that our mercifully dead parents would be feeling if they could see how badly I 'd turned out . My brother-in-law played Greek chorus , warning of the ravages the future would hold should I fail to " turn things around . " <p> Somehow , I managed to stay awake and take all of the berating in a silence that I hoped passed for contrition . When we arrived at the house , I passed , politely , on the dinner that Sis had kept warm in the oven . I apologized one last time for my mistakes , promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the guestrooms . <p> I closed and locked my door , threw the duffel on the loveseat and opened it , intending to climb into bed with the book . Not to read it , mind you  --  my eyes and my brain were beyond reading at this point . No , I simply wanted to hold it close to me , the way a child might hold a stuffed bear . But the book was not in my bag . I emptied all the contents , all of my possessions , and sorted through each item . Then I resorted over and over again until it was clear there was no book to be found . You can imagine how frantic I was . <p> I made myself settle down enough to think logically and decided that the book must have fallen out in the car on the ride home . My brother-in-law was an erratic driver at best and my sister 's non-stop scolding had only degraded what little skill he possessed . We had taken some sharp comers getting onto and off of the expressway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had , most likely , toppled during one of those turns . The book , which had been sitting atop the rest of my gear , likely fell out of the bag and was now resting beneath the driver 's seat . <p> I managed to wait until I heard my hosts retire for the night , then I made my way downstairs and out through the laundry room into the attached garage . The sedan was unlocked and I performed an elaborate , let us say obsessive search , but there was no sign of the book . <p> I returned to the guestroom and went through the bag again and again and came up empty each time . I lay down on the bed , fully clothed , and tried to think of the other possibilities . I 'd either dropped the novel on the train , in the station , or in the parking garage . Tomorrow , I decided , I would find a way to return to the station and comb the area . Perhaps locate a lost and found office . If nothing turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still had my ticket stub with all the pertinent information . The worst case scenario , I imagined , would involve purchasing a fresh copy of the novel at a bookstore . Though I did n't have an author 's name , I had the title and that , I thought , should be sufficient . This was a distasteful option , however . I very much wanted the copy that Klingman had given me . I wanted , needed , that specific book . That object . <p> But with a plan of action decided , I attempted to sleep . Of course , it was futile . By 3 A.M. , I was consumed with a level of anxiety I had never known . Even my expulsion hearing paled in comparison to the worry and nervous tension I experienced that night . I paced the floor . I tried to exhaust myself with sit-ups and push-ups . I raided the medicine cabinet and swallowed a handful of aspirins . And I went downstairs and rifled my sister 's library drawers until I found an incomplete Pinochle deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has always amused me . ) I took the deck upstairs and spent an hour running through my various routines , making cards disappear and reappear and trade places . And for the first time since I 'd initiated myself in the brotherhood of monty , the cards failed to bring me any solace . <p> Can you imagine , old friend , how desperate I felt in this moment ? It was the kind of realization that reroutes the intestines and bites into the heart . What I did next should inform you of my state of mind that night . As my anxiety began to trammel my reason , I started to repack my duffel . When I was done , I slipped downstairs , found the key to my sister 's convertible in her pocketbook and borrowed her car . My brother-in-law , up until the day he died , was incensed with my use of the word " borrowed . " But as I backed out of their driveway , I had every intention of returning before morning . <p> I tried to retrace the route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I secured directions at a highway gas station . It was only after I 'd parked in the train station garage that I realized I had no money for the exit fee . <p> I searched the garage and the areas of the station that I 'd passed through . There was no trace of the book . The lost and found office was closed but I pestered a ticket clerk until she opened the door and let me inspect every bin . I inquired about a search of the train I 'd arrived on , the Seaboard Star , and was informed that it had just been thoroughly cleaned before its imminent departure and that no books had been discovered . <p> An analyst I knew briefly once theorized that my actions that night were the result of the accumulated traumas I 'd been experiencing since the death of my mother and father . That my parents ' demise and my banishment to de Sale and my expulsion from the school all coalesced and exploded inside of me . And that the force of that explosion propelled me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat on a bench in the cold of the National Station , I felt all my panic and doubt slip away from me and I became as focused as a young Houdini , And at the heart of this utter calmness I found the certainty , the absolute conviction , that if I did not recover the Klingman copy of Refugee , I would die . This confession , I would guess , leads you to believe that I was not in my right mind when I decided to re-board the Seaboard Star and ride north once again , in search of the book and , perhaps , in search of Klingman . <p> But you must trust me , F , when I write that I was as sane as I have ever been . Sane enough to approach every conscious soul in the station and proffer my father 's vintage Hamilton " Mason " - model wristwatch for the price of a train ticket . This was self-inflicted robbery , but it took me until the last boarding call before I found an elderly porter who knew the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd asked and threw in the cost of breakfast and lunch . <p> For hours , I walked back and forth through all the cars of the northbound Seaboard Star , looking under every seat , checking every rest room , inquiring of every uniformed hand . But there was no trace of my lost paperback . <p> And so I tried , with a surprising degree of success , to re-create the book in my head . I closed my eyes and slouched down in my chair , huddled into myself and let the rocking of the car lull me into a kind of lucid dreaming , a recollection of the story that was , if not a perfect re-creation , even more interesting for its discrepancies . Where my imagination insisted on rewriting the author , it managed , to my delight , to retain the overall mood and tone and , if you can stand it , theme of the book . <p> I 'd had only enough cash to get to Manchaug , a one-horse valley town in the farmlands a few hours west of Quinsigamond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded over time , but I believe I hoped to find a ride into the city and to look up all the Klingmans in the phone directory . Before I left the depot , however , something made me stop at the ticket counter and inquire if there were any bookstores nearby . <p> Remember that this was when people still retained a degree of literacy and civility . The clerk explained that Pittsfield was my best bet for selection , but there was a local antiquarian shop about ten miles down Route 4 . <p> " Of course , " the clerk added as I turned away , " they 'll both be closed for the holiday . " <p> I turned back to him and he smiled and said , " I doubt anyone will be open on Thanksgiving . " <p> The word hit me like a rubber bullet for two reasons . Yes , I felt some guilt over my flight from my sister and the worry I must be have caused her . But , as cavalier and selfish as it will sound , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in locating Refugee or Klingman . <p> I left the station and walked out onto the road , trying to think . If I turned right , I 'd be headed in the direction of Quinsigamond and de Sale and the possibility of food and shelter from a pitying headmaster . The possibility , as well , of finding Klingman . He had , after all , like me , boarded the train at Gomper 's Station . <p> But as you have already guessed , my friend , I turned left . And for the first , but certainly not the last time in my life , I began to hitchhike . You have to understand , I was obsessed . However lofty it might sound in retrospect , I can only tell you that at the time it felt as if I were on a kind of quest . And , as in the case of most quests , neither fatigue nor reason could dissuade me . <p> There was little traffic and I decided that it would be best to walk as I hitched . Route 4 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interstate . And by the time I had my thumb out , most travelers had already arrived at their destinations and were sampling the cider and cheese . I 'm sure I looked suspicious to the few cars and trucks that did roll by , what with my slept-in clothes and uncombed hair and vintage seaman 's duffel large enough to hold a small body . <p> But I did n't much mind . The day was brisk , but I was wearing my father 's old Navy pea coat . And I had time to think , once again , about the book . This time , however , I let myself extrapolate freely , taking the refugee into sideline adventures that his author had never considered . <p> About two hours later , I rounded a bend in the road , looked out on a classic New England covered bridge and fell to my knees in near faint . The sensation of collapse vanished almost as quickly as it had come . But I sat on my duffel breathing through the aftershock of it . My legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had coursed through my body like a current . <p> When I collected myself , I attributed the spell to hunger and sleeplessness and the general upsetting of the past week . I picked myself up and continued across the bridge and on the other side I saw a red-shingle cabin with a sign on the roof that announced <p> SCHEHEREZADE 'S RARE AND USED BOOKS There was a porch fronting the house and on the porch sat wheelbarrows filled with books . <p> I confess that I ran across the road without looking , dropped my duffel in a pile of leaves and leapt up the three stairs to the porch . I began pawing through the offerings . It was a real mishmash  --  hardcovers and paperbacks , fiction and non-fiction and textbooks , atlases and magazines and even postcards . I went through it all like a man panning for gold . But I think I knew , as I looked , that I would not find Refugee . <p> When I 'd exhausted the offerings and confirmed my suspicion , I sat down on the stairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a bell ring . I turned around to see a man standing behind me . He would have been my first choice to play a farmer in the local production of Oklahoma . He was gaunt and tall and serious looking , craggy-faced and with a head of thin steely hair that he combed straight back over his bulging dome of a skull . <p> " Can I help you ? " he said in a tone that implied I 'd better have a good reason for sitting on his steps and I 'd better deliver it fast . <p> " I was looking for a book , " was all I could think to say . <p> He squinted and said , " We 're closed . It 's Thanksgiving . " <p> " I understand , " I said and stood up . " Sorry to bother you . " <p> I got as far as the shoulder of the road when he yelled , " What book were you looking for ? " <p> I turned back and yelled the title . He was the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched his eyes glaze a little in concentration as he scratched at his chest through his flannel shirt . <p> " I do n't know it , " he yelled . " Who 's the author ? " <p> I took a step back toward him and said , " I have no idea . " <p> This seemed to surprise him and , after looking back into the shop , he said , " Come on in here for a minute . " <p> His name was Albert Southard . And he lived like a monk in a back room of the store . In the years since we met , I 've often wondered what became of him . And I 've wondered what became of that unlikely store in the middle of nowhere . Inside , it proved bigger than it had looked from the road . It is , in my memory , a haven of cozy warmth , a honeycomb of small shelf-lined rooms , each one fitted with an easy chair or a sofa , all of them draped with quilts and comforters and pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the shelves , forming pyramids in the middle of the corridors . I could see that a sense of order was not the shop 's chief virtue . <p> Mr. Southard offered me a seat in front of his desk . On top of the desk , in the center of his blotter , steamed a TV dinner of turkey and mashed potatoes . Southard took his glasses from his shirt pocket and asked me to tell him about this book that I seemed to need so desperately . I gave the same details that I 've given to you . ( Over time , that description of the book became a kind of prayer , repeated so often that I could say it in my sleep . ) At the end of my recitation , Southard shook his head . He began to walk to his piles of reference volumes , asking , over his shoulder , where I found my original copy of the novel . I started my story and when I mentioned Klingman 's name , Albert Southard stopped in his tracks . <p> He returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention it , I think I do know the book . " It was a rare volume , he said . The print run had been minimal . It could be a costly investment . What was the maximum I 'd be willing to pay ? <p> The possibility that I could n't afford the book had not occurred to me . Mr. Southard must have seen the crestfallen look on my face because before I could respond , he added , " But we 're getting ahead of ourselves . First we 'll see if we can locate this Refugee . " <p> He told me to make myself at home , to feel free to browse the store while he made some calls . <p> I looked down at the aluminum tray organizing his Thanksgiving feast and said , " I do n't want to interrupt your meal . " <p> He seemed confused for a second , then he said , " Have you eaten ? " <p> I admitted I had not . He said he had another Swanson 's in the freezer . Would I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since finishing a cheese sandwich somewhere in Smyrna . I thanked him for the hospitality and he went off to pop a tray into his toaster oven . <p> I did as he advised , let myself ramble through the maze of the store , running my finger along rows of spines , silently reciting titles and author 's names as if they were train stops along an extended journey . <p> Sometime later Mr. Southard found me in the rear of the place , sitting on the floor with a tower of books at my knee . <p> " Dinner 's served , " he said and I looked up to see him holding my TV dinner in a oven-mitted hand . <p> We ate on opposite sides of the desk . I devoured every scrap . Washed it all down with warm ginger ale . <p> " I 've got some leads , " he said to me as we ate . <p> He spoke , quite knowledgeably , and , at times , quite humorously , about various used bookstores all over the country and their often eccentric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry cobbler desserts , he surprised me by asking , " By any chance are you looking for a place to stay ? " <p> I had imagined I would be sleeping in a train station , waiting until I got so cold and hungry that I had no choice but to call my sister . <p> " It 's no shame to need a place to stay , " Southard said . " Come here . " <p> I got up and followed him back to the front of the shop . He put my duffel on the largest couch and said , " It 's not four star , but it 's warm and the sofa is comfortable . " <p> Before I could reply , before I could argue or thank him , he slipped into his overcoat and said , " I have to visit my sister and her family . I 'll be back in the morning . We 'll have some breakfast and talk some more about this book of yours . " Then he was out the door and I was locked inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man leaves a complete stranger alone in his home overnight ? Let me tell you something . Southard was part of a tribe that is larger than you might expect . <p> Can you begin to imagine the flood of doubt and fear and , yes , excitement and hope I experienced that night ? Alone in an unknown town , without a dime to my name , I felt as if I were living someone else ' . , life , as if a mistake had been made and my mundane existence had been swapped for one of adventure and freedom and danger and absolute chance . <p> Is it any surprise that I could not sleep that evening ? I made some coffee . I ate the pear and the jar of nuts that I found on the desk . And I carried several armfuls of books , more books than I could read in a lifetime , to the couch and spent a delightful if hallucinatory night sampling all manner of story . <p> Over hot oatmeal and bananas the next morning , Mr. Southard offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender age , that this was nothing but charity . That he had no need for an employee . But I was not in any position to be proud . I took the job and stayed for three months , saving up my money and learning the basics of the book trade . And more than this . I began that morning a dialogue that would continue the rest of my days . I entered into an exchange about books and writers and stories and what they can mean to a life . <p> Every other week or so , Southard would make a vague comment about a lead he had on Refugee . But nothing ever came of them . <p> When I finally left Scheherezade 's with the intention of moving , in general , westward , Albert Southard gave me the name of a bookstore in Milwaukee that had purportedly sold a copy of Refugee last year . He also mentioned that the proprietor might have work for me . <p> And so I became a traveler , a traveling reader , staying briefly in some places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . My general purpose remained the search for my elusive paperback and the man who had given it to me . But as time passed , it became a passive quest . It was not that I gave up looking so much as I came to understand , to feel , that it would take years to conclude my search . <p> I worked in libraries and bookshops mostly , referred from one owner or manager to another . But I can also claim employment as night watchman , parking lot attendant and house sitter . All jobs that allowed me to read for long , uninterrupted hours . <p> I attempted to settle down once , in the exact middle of my life . It was an emotional time and I let a rare bout of loneliness influence me . I tried , very hard , please believe me , to make a family . But I was not suited to the role of patriarch and I hurt too many people for too many years . It was not that I did not love my wife and the twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity and to this day I ache with regret at the way I failed them . But I was driven , compelled  --  just as I 'd been compelled to jump on the Seaboard Star and flee the Capital all those years ago  --  to live a different life than the one they required and deserved . <p> Is it any wonder that so many religious traditions insist their priests remain celibate ? It is a setting apart , is it not ? It is a way to claim them as acolytes of another way , another tradition , separate from the satisfactions of the domestic world . <p> I 'm trying to say that on the day Klingman gave me that book , he claimed me for another way of life , initiated me into something wondrous and ruined me for the joys of the grounded . <p> I 'm saying that I followed the only road open to me . I continued my wandering , a kind of tin pan asceticism . I came to see most of my native land and much of the rest of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that , though I never attained the depth of intensity I 'd known with Refugee , the rails always provided a heightened reading experience . <p> It was early in the travels that I began to understand the phenomenon I titled , at some point , " the seizure , " the numbing faint and chill that would overcome me from time to time , just as it had on Route 4 when I first glimpsed that covered bridge on my way to Sheherezade 's . <p> The second occurrence happened in Peru , Kansas , where I was working in a small shop called The Bookworm . I had not been long in the Prairie State but I 'd already assisted a customer in securing a rare first edition of a C. Gus French novel . The collector , a pharmaceutical salesman who passed through our region every other month , was so thrilled that he invited me to join him for a night on the town . His cheer was so genuine that I accepted , not knowing that a night on the town meant sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King motel room . The other players were friendly but wary of the youngster . I soon replaced their wariness with surprise and then , annoyance , when , by 10 P.M. , I was smirking behind most of the chips on the table . <p> My experience at de Sale had taught me nothing , however , and 1 let my early good fortune make me cocky . Also , there was liquor present and while I only nursed a beer or two , I was new to the charms of alcohol and perhaps my play grew more sloppy than usual . Whatever the reason , my good fortune faded rapidly and by the end of the game I was busted . It was as I got up from the table and walked into the bathroom that the seizure hit me . I managed to close the door behind me and steady myself against the sink . There was a cold sensation throughout my body , particularly along my joints . This was followed by a near faint , which , in turn , was followed by the most vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Only it became apparent to me in seconds that it was n't deja vu at all . It was an episode from the novel , from Refugee . On the Seaboard Star , I had read an almost-exact description of everything that took place in that motel room . Everything that had happened to the novel 's protagonist the arrival in Kansas , the invitation to a private card game , the flush of early success and the subsequent loss of all the winnings  --  had been replayed in my life . I was the protagonist . <p> It happened again two years later in East Texas where I was robbed at gunpoint while exiting a movie theater . <p> It happened in Denio , Nevada , where I was arrested for vagrancy and through a series of miscommunications and bad luck , ended up serving thirty days of county jail time . <p> And in Castile , New York , where I met a belly dancer named Glynnis and ended up in a hot air balloon celebrating her birthday . <p> And in Lowell , Massachusetts , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served up a sausage omelet at the Paradise Diner . <p> In some strange way , for reasons that to this day I do not understand , my life was foretold in a forgotten , spine-cracked paperback novel titled Refugee . <p> I last experienced a seizure on the day that we met , my friend , on that train to the Capital . ( I 've never told you , but I was heading to see my sister who was living in a nursing home not far from the National Station . One last visit to apologize and say good-bye . ) <p> I want to apologize to you as well . I know I appeared overbearing during our initial meeting , but when you reach my age you will see that sometimes one must dispense with manners when time is in short supply . And I hope my little gift made up for my rudeness . <p> No need to track me down to say , " thank you . " Giving the right book to the right person is a joy I 've long treasured . Beyond this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's no surprise that this is where I find myself in the end . On a train . Rattling and swaying , out of the world and into another story . But perhaps it will surprise you to learn that when I boarded this particular train and made my way to the last car ( still traveling in the economy coach , of course ) , and located my seat , I found a large and shabby passenger in the adjoining chair . <p> Klingman was reading Refugee . He 'd left another , more slender volume on my seat . He lifted it , with one hand , without breaking off from his reading . And I took it from him as I squeezed into my place without a word . It has been over an hour now and still we have not spoken . I 've stolen a few glimpses and he looks the same as he did when I first met him . When my nose began to bleed at the start of this letter , he pulled his yellow handkerchief from his sleeve and offered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is so much that I want to ask him but I do n't want to interrupt his joy , the beauty and wholeness of his moments enveloped in the story of my life . My guess is that he is anxious for me to put down this pen and pick up my last book . <p> I 'll trust the porter to mail this for me . <p> In case you 're wondering , the volume currently in my lap appears to be more short story than novel . There is no author 's name on the cover . And this time there is no title . Only a picture , a faded cover illustration of an old man sitting in a train car reading a book whose cover features an old man sitting in a train car reading a book . <p> I have no idea where this engine is headed or if I 'll have time to finish the tale . I have no interest in knowing . The countryside passing me now looks like no land I 've seen before . But then , my eyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands , once so strong and agile , capable of tricks that could make you distrust yourself , are , today , gnarled and stiff . By the time I finish turning the last page , they 'll be good for nothing . <p> You , on the other hand , have much to do . Places to go , as they say , and people to see . I 'm sentimental enough to ask that you think of me from time to time . Hopefully , in a favorable light . I ask that you try to understand why I did what I did . Why I chose you out of the world and initiated you . Why I made you into a reader . <p> I ask , if possible , that you forgive me , my friend . Please know that I wish you all the best , despite any evidence to the contrary . <p> And now , if you 'll excuse me , I have some reading to catch up on . <p> Sincerely , <p> <p> By Jack O'Connell <p> Unlike most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a familiar name to most readers . His novels Box 9 , Wireless , and The Skin Palace have n't appeared in the science fiction sections of stores  --  like Jonathan Carroll , he 's a writer whose work fits uneasily into contemporary genre categories . His latest novel , Word Made Flesh , attracted some more attention in the sf/ fantasy field and it will be interesting to see where his next book takes us . At the moment , Mr. O'Connell is editing an " All Noir " issue of the journal Paradoxa . He recently collaborated on an interview with Richard Matheson for the same magazine 's " Fifties Fiction " issue , and you might detect a bit of RM 's influence on this tale . You might also miss your stop if you 're reading this story on the train  --  and if you do , who knows where that might lead you ... ? <p>
