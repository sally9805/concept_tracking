The No Child Left Alive Program " Let me tell you how much I hate human children , " said Dagmar Mandible to her sister , Hedy . Dagmar gazed down the row of waxy green cornstalks where the Shluffmuffin twins had vanished and cursed softly under her breath . Nourished by the gentle Cincinnati rains , this year 's cornstalks grew higher , bushier , and more lushly than those in the rain forest , assuming that corn grows in the rain forest , a shaky assumption at best . " No , hate is too weak a word , " said Dagmar , adjusting her wide-brimmed black hat above her sunglasses . " Let me tell you how much I loathe . . . despise . . . detest . . . abhor and . . . abominate human children . " " Oh , Dagmar , you 're just mad because Cheyenne and Wally got away from us again , " said Hedy . This was not untrue . Cheyenne and Wally Shluffmuffin were the snotty ten-year-old orphans that Dagmar and Hedy had found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On their first night at Mandible House in the hushed and lovely Dripping Fang Forest , Dagmar and Hedy got the twins settled in their cheery bedrooms and served them a nutritious all-chocolatewelcome dinner . But after dinner the nosy kids began snooping about . And just because they discovered that Dagmar and Hedy were giant ants who were breeding a race of super-ants to replace mankind and end life on Earth as we know it , those ungrateful little brats ran away . Fortunately , Dagmar and Hedy were able to recapture them a scant few weeks later . But on the cab ride back to Mandible House , the twins claimed to need a bathroom so badly they were about to poop their pants , and Dagmar had compassionately ordered the driver to stop at a gas station restroom . Cheyenne and Wally went in , locked the restroom doors , and escaped through the windows and into the cornfield before the Mandible sisters could catch them . " Yes , I am mad that Cheyenne and Walter got away from us again , " said Dagmar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate human children . Hate their soft spongy flesh . Hate their soft horrid hair . Hate their watery little eyes . Hate their moist pink mouths . Hate the revolting heat that radiates from their limp , flabby bodies with the skeletons on the inside instead of on the outside where skeletons belong . " From beyond the white concrete restrooms adjoining the cornfield , the horn of a car began beeping loudly , angrily , and unceasingly . Dagmar pretended not to notice . " So , dearest one , how do we get the repulsive little wretches back ? " asked Hedy . " Run down the corn rows and hope to catch up with them ? " " No , no , nothing as tiresome as that , " said Dagmar . " We need to get the big picture . We need to fly up above the cornfield and see where they 're hiding . " " Unfortunately , " said Hedy , " we 're not the flying variety of ants . " " No , " said Dagmar , " we 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hire ourselves a pair of wings . " The beeping of the horn was now so loud and so insistent , it was impossible to ignore . Taking their own sweet time about it , Dagmar and Hedy circled the restrooms and returned to the taxicab that was waiting for them , its meter running . " All right , driver , " Dagmar announced , approaching the cab , " there 's been a slight change of plan . You will now drive us to the nearest airport that you know of where we can hire a pilot and a small crop-dusting plane . " " A pilot and a what ? " shouted the driver , his face turning purple . " I am certain you heard me , " said Dagmar . " First it 's ' Drive us to Dripping Fang Forest , ' " sputtered the driver . " Then it 's ' No , drive us to a gas station . ' Then it 's ' No , drive us to a police station . ' Then it 's ' No , drive us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drive us to the Natural History Museum . ' Now it 's ' No , drive us to the nearest airport where we can hire a pilot and a small crop-dusting plane . ' Well , I wo n't take any more of this , do you hear ? I 've had it with you people ! I 'm no longer driving you anywhere . Pay me the twenty-eight dollars and seventy-five cents that 's on the meter right now and then get the heck out of my face ! " Dagmar walked right up to the door of the cab and leaned down so that her face was uncomfortably close to that of the driver . " Please watch closely now , " she said in a quiet voice . She peeled away the bottom of her flesh-colored rubber human mask , revealing her horrible ant head with her gigantic black eyes , and her horrible mouth that looked like a huge pair of horrible black pliers , only sharper . " Now then , " she continued in a reasonable tone , " you have two choices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you know of where we can hire a pilot and a small crop-dusting plane . Choice B is to have me pluck out your eyeballs and suck your brains from your skull through your eyeholes . Drive or pluck-and-suck -- this is your choice . Which do you prefer ? " The cab driver seemed unable to speak . He made barely audible clicking noises in the back of his throat . " Choice A or choice B , " Dagmar repeated . " Choose one before I count to three , or I shall be forced to choose for you . Frankly , I prefer choice B , the pluck-and-suck . Ready ? One . . . Two . . . " " A ! " croaked the cab driver , " choice A ! " " Choice A , please , ma'am , " coached Dagmar , leaning closer . " Choice A , please , ma'am , " croaked the cab driver . " What a pity , " said Dagmar . " I was so in the mood for a little teatime snack of brains with eyeballs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work should be submitted online at harcourt.com/contact or mailed to the following address : Permissions Department , Harcourt , Inc. , 6277 Sea Harbor Drive , Orlando , Florida 32887-6777 .
