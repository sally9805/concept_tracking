Manes lashing , forelegs reaching , two horses galloped side by side across the high desert of Nevada . The palomino and the bay drank in crisp January air as they strained against their reins . They rejoiced in the dazzling blue and white day just as much as their riders . Samantha Forster leaned low on Ace 's neck . Her eyes squinted almost shut as the bay ran into the wind . If she had n't pulled her hair into a tight clip under her old brown Stetson , it would be blizzarding around her face . On days like this , when he 'd left the warm confinement of the barn behind , Ace 's surging eagerness reminded her he was a mustang . The bay gelding longed to run with a herd , even if it was only a herd of two . A sudden tug at the bit telegraphed along the reins into Sam 's hands . Her fingers closed tighter and her deerskin gloves kept the reins from sliding away . Ace wanted to race . Although Jen 's big palomino mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ace always thought he could win . Once in a while he could , when the palomino turned skittish and proved Jen 's insight in nicknaming her mare Silly . Sam turned her head just enough to see Jen . Jen leaned slightly forward in her saddle . Her white-blond braids streamed behind her , flat on thewind , and morning sunlight glazed the lenses of her glasses . Jen did n't notice Sam 's glance . She rode like a female Paul Revere , as if she had a mission and only her palomino mare could take her there . Jennifer Kenworthy was Sam 's best friend and she 'd been gone for most of winter vacation . But Jen and her mom had driven in from Utah late the night before . Even though it had been nearly eleven , long past Sam 's nine o'clock limit on phone calls , Jen had braved Dad 's anger and called Sam to beg for an early-morning ride . Jen 's desperation meant her parents had n't reached a truce . Maybe because Dad had just returned from his honeymoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him it was , after all , vacation , Dad allowed Sam to talk with Jen , and make plans to meet between River Bend and Gold Dust ranches , for a ride . This morning , Sam had dressed in the dark . She 'd pulled on the jeans , red pullover sweater , and boots she 'd laid out the night before , then tiptoed downstairs without squeaking a single board . She even made it out to the barn without Blaze , River Bend Ranch 's watchdog , raising a ruckus . Sam could n't think of anything better than celebrating Jen 's first day back with a run across War Drum Flats . Sure , they watched for cracks and bare roots , anything that meant disaster if a horse tripped at a full run , but they knew this patch of alkali desert well . It spread before them in all directions , smooth and level as a white tablecloth . For a few steps , Ace veered east . Sam corrected him , keeping him in step with Silly , but her heart pulled toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of her eye , Sam could just see the mountain range . Glowing in the morning sun , the peaks looked smooth and soft , as if they 'd been molded from orange sherbet . But things were n't always what they seemed . The peaks were inaccessible to cars or trucks and only the most determined rider could follow the faint paths etched by deer , antelope , and wild horses . The Calico Mountains were steep and dangerous and Sam was glad . She 'd seen the Phantom scale that rocky mountain face just a few days ago . He and his new lead mare had been guiding his herd back into their secret valley . They were there now , Sam thought with a sigh , safe for the winter . She had no reason to worry over the great silver stallion . Everything in her own life was fine , too . Even though she had a brand-new stepmother , Sam trusted Brynna Olson - now Forster - to fit into the family . Tranquility for the mustangs and her family meant Sam could single-mindedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : she 'd help Jen . With a squeal of frustration , Ace surged forward . He wanted to run faster than his short legs would carry him . Beyond the thunder of running hooves and the wind singing through Ace 's mane , Sam heard the slapping of her saddlebags . Each time Ace 's hind legs shot behind him , leather creaked . The pouches , buckled to her saddle , hung heavy with schoolwork and a flashlight . Jen had arrived home just in time . There were three days until the end of vacation . Three days until they had to turn in the first stage of their homework on the ghost town of Nugget . " No problem , " Sam muttered to Ace , " except we have n't seen it yet . " Since she was a little kid , Sam had heard stories about the old mining town of Nugget . At night , little white lights appeared in the old general store , said one tale , and the saloon had a trapdoor that dropped into black nothingness . The ground which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it sat above miles of earth honeycombed with mine shafts . Those were supposed to be filled with poisonous gases and , of course , the entire town of Nugget was rumored to be haunted . Why had n't she ever been there ? Until ten years ago , the town had n't even been locked up . Now , while it awaited status as a historic landmark , a padlocked gate blocked the entrance . According to Mrs. Ely , only one team of students would receive a key to that padlock . Sam felt her own satisfied smile . That key was in her pocket . ( Continues ... )
