High school football has a proud tradition in California towns like Oakdale in Stanislaus County and Colfax in Placer County . <p> Anticipation was high Friday night as the Oakdale Mustangs and the Colfax Falcons prepared to meet in the postseason for the fifth time since 2002 . <p> In Oakdale , boosters already were cooking up 300 pounds of tri-tip and laying out blankets on the best seats in " the Corral " before the crowd - Oakdale games commonly pull 6,000 - arrived . In Colfax , the Falcons boarded a bus and began the two-hour trip to meet their opponents . <p> And then a phone call brought everything to a halt . Some 80 miles to the west , in Alameda County , a state Superior Court judge had just ordered the game suspended , throwing the future of the entire Division IV playoffs into chaos . <p> The Falcons bus turned around , and Mustangs coach Trent Merzon tried to explain what had happened to his student athletes . <p> " They were shocked , " Merzon said Sunday . " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I did n't know how to react . " <p> Merzon and coaches at the seven other schools scheduled for the playoffs instead spent the weekend explaining to their young charges how a conflict between two complicated sets of rules - each set up by adults to protect children - had wound up in a court of law , where today a judge will hear arguments over whether a paperwork snafu should have made a talented young student in Auburn Placer County ineligible to play football . <p> The decision , when it comes , may affect not just the young athlete 's future , but also the future of his team , his division , and by extension , the rules governing high school sports throughout California . It will impact some 700,000 athletes , most of whom , in the end , just want to play ball . <p> The tangled tale centers on a 16-year-old named Dalton Dyer , a young man with a passion for football and hopes of playing in college , maybe for Cal , maybe - who knows ? - for the pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically , " Dyer said Sunday . " It 's fun . " <p> Dyer has been in foster care his entire life , and has moved repeatedly under court order , living in Oakland until sixth grade , then with an aunt in Auburn , then in a foster home in Vallejo before moving back to his aunt 's house in August , when he enrolled as a junior in Placer High School , home of the Hillmen . <p> Dyer was soon a standout defensive back , playing well enough that the Auburn Journal took notice of him in its coverage of the team . In October , another school , noticing he had been listed as a transfer student , called the Sac-Joaquin section of the California Interscholastic Federation to ask whether he was eligible to play at Placer . <p> The CIF is the body empowered under California law to govern the state 's regional and statewide interscholastic athletics . Some 1,400 schools participate in the CIF system and fall under its eligibility rules , intended to ensure that as many students as possible can play sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might seek to recruit star athletes from out of town or create temporary addresses to keep talented players on their teams . <p> Violating the CIF rules can force teams to forfeit games played by ineligible players - and a handful of teams are forced to forfeit games every year because of infractions . When CIF Commissioner Pete Saco looked over Placer 's paperwork on Dyer , he concluded that he was looking at another rule violation . <p> Saco concluded that Dyer 's move to Auburn in August was not a " valid change of residence , " which the rules define as the movement of a student and his or her full immediate family , and all their possessions , from one residence to another . Since Dyer was a foster child , Saco concluded , Placer High should have filed the paperwork for a " hardship " transfer . <p> Because Dyer was ineligible in the five games he had played , Saco ruled that the Hillmen must forfeit those five games , three of which it had won , including two league games . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in an Oct. 27 statement . " But the rules are clear , ironclad and do n't allow us any room to work things out after the fact . " <p> Suddenly the Hillmen were no longer looking at a potential championship year . At the end of the season , instead of a 4-2 record , the Hillmen had a 2-4 record . Their Placer County rivals at Colfax , with a 3-3 record , prepared for the playoffs and the game against Oakdale . <p> " I am sickened about this situation , " Placer High athletic director Mark Lee said in a statement issued after the ruling . " The CIF bylaws are clear and I accept full responsibility for my misinterpretation of them . It is my fault and no one else . " <p> When the news hit the Hillmen locker room , Dyer was distraught , he said Sunday . <p> " I actually thought it was my fault . Even though he said it was n't , it was my paperwork , " he said . " The worst part was seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose son is on the Placer High team with Dyer , listened to his son 's description of that emotional day and the team 's fallen prospects . An attorney and the former president of the Little League , he met with some other parents , the school principal , athletic director Lee and Hillmen coach Joey Montoya to see whether anything could be done . <p> " We did what guys who are trained to read things carefully do , and we spotted some real issues , " he said . <p> Woodward decided that the CIF 's rule created a hurdle for any foster child , since none could be considered to have an " immediate family . " After consulting with the National Center for Youth Law in Oakland , Woodward concluded that the rule was in conflict with state laws requiring foster children to be given the same opportunities as all other students . <p> Representing the school district pro bono , Woodward appealed to the CIF , suggesting that it choose to see foster children as a " family of one , " thereby making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and exempt from the need for hardship paperwork . <p> When the CIF rejected Dyer 's appeal , the National Center for Youth Law decided to take up the case . <p> " Dalton had to write a letter explaining he was in foster care in order to get a waiver . His aunt had to write a letter explaining their family situation , " said Leecia Welch , an attorney for the youth law center . " The bottom line is that foster youth are entitled to a level playing field ... they should n't have to overcome barriers that other youths do n't face . " <p> The center filed its petition Thursday , arguing that the court should halt the Oakdale-Colfax game , restore Placer 's forfeited victories , and let Dyer 's team take its original place in the playoffs against Oakdale . <p> On Friday , Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch postponed the Oakdale-Colfax game until the legal questions can be addressed . <p> And as the tri-tip sizzled in Oakdale for a game that would never come , the Falcons bus headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home and shrugged his shoulders , " said Beth Ann Tremoureux , whose son Thomas Tremoureux , 17 , a Falcons safety , was on the bus . " He 's got a good attitude . He 's worked very hard all season to get this far . But the parents feel this is little ridiculous that it came to this . " <p> For its part , the CIF is wondering when its playoffs will take place . <p> " We are extremely concerned about the potential that the legal challenge ... has to derail the entire Division IV playoff schedule and unfairly harm eight schools that have done nothing wrong and are not parties to this dispute , " CIF said in a statement . " The last-minute nature of this action was beyond our control , and we regret the inconvenience to the players , coaches , referees , students , parents and alumni planning to attend the game . " <p> Over the weekend , other coaches in the division , like Dixon 's Scott Winslow , fielded phone calls from families that were making holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that he did not know who the team would eventually play - or even whether the playoffs would continue at all . <p> " One of the nightmare scenarios is nothing gets decided tomorrow , " he said Sunday . " Then we 're all sitting there going , ' What now ? " <p> A special education teacher , Winslow said he had nothing but sympathy for the plight of disadvantaged athletes - but noted that he had managed to file the right paperwork for foster children on his team in the past , and could n't understand how Placer High slipped up . Moreover , he said , if the rules need to be changed , then why does his football season have to wait for it to happen ? <p> " That 's where I kind of wonder how much of this was football-motivated versus really what 's best for the kid , " he said . <p> Oakdale coach Merzon , for his part , said the issue was clear . <p> " There are rules , and the rules are in place for a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ randomly select who has to follow those rules ... you do n't get to speed just because you 're late for work . It 's a speeding ticket . It 's a rule , " he said . " Our society is based on laws . Our religion is based on commandments . You ca n't pick and choose . " <p> Dyer , for his part , no longer feels like he let his team down - helped in part by his fellow players decision to name him captain for the game immediately after the forfeit order . Now he 's thinking of the future ; the Hillmen earned their right to play in the playoffs , he believes , and he wants to play football . <p> " I felt like everybody was behind me on this . They were boosting me up , " he said . " I hope that we 'll be able to go to the playoffs . We worked hard all summer ... if we practice hard all weekend , I 'm pretty sure we 'll win it .
