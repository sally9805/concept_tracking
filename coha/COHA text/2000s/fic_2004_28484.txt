Chapter One " Madison O'Malley , this here 's the nicest thing anybody 's done for me all week . " Grinning like a young boy , the burly construction worker tipped back his hard hat and swiped a fingerful of frosting from the cupcake in his hand . The flame flickered and danced on the small candle stuck in the fluffy chocolate . " I ca n't believe you remembered . " " She remembers everybody 's birthday , " the rangy welder on his right informed him . " The cupcake she baked me for my birthday even had sprinkles on it . " " Yeah ? Did she put your name on it , like she did mine here ? " The shorter man nodded at the white icing loops that spelled out Tiny . " She sure did . Did n't you , Madison ? " " I sure did , Jake . " Madison 's smile came easily , her brown eyes sparkling with the pleasure it gave her to make one of her customer 's day just a little special . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once she got to know them , and she always put their name and a candle on the little treat . " I just did n't know if you liked chocolate or carrot cake better . If you 'll tell me , I 'll remember for next year . " Tiny told her that what she 'd given him was just fine , and walked off , still grinning . The welder she knew only as Jake took a cellophane-wrappedmuffin from the display on the side of the gleaming silver catering truck and handed her a dollar . " Morning , Madison . " Another of the forty customers crowding toward her held out a five . " I 'm taking two poppy seed and a banana . " " I have coffee and a ham-and-cheese roll here , " a voice from behind him announced . " Same here . " Another worker , this one unfamiliar , took Jake 's place . He handed her two five-dollar bills . " That 's for me and Sid back there . " Madison glanced at the front of the newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen on the strip of masking tape centered above the brim . " Thanks , Buzz . " Having been acknowledged by name , the new guy smiled and stepped back to be swallowed by the forward surge of others wanting to make the most of their morning break . " Hey , Madison ! Do you have those carrot-cake muffins today ? " " She only does those on Tuesday and Friday , " someone replied for her . " Today is zucchini and poppy seed . " Another dirty hand bearing dollar bills appeared through the sea of worn denim and work shirts . " I took one of each . " A machinist with a streak of grease on his cheek held out a ten . " Same . And orange juice . " Taking the men 's money , she made change from the small black pack she wore around her waist . The carefully arranged rows of muffins and cheese rolls she had baked herself that morning were quickly disappearing , along with iced cartons of juice and milk and gallons of coffee from her catering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt on the men 's hands and clothes . Most of the welders , electricians , steelworkers and laborers at this construction site - like the stevedores and dock workers she would feed next on her route - were salt-of-the-earth , hardworking men who knew the value of even harder work . They were much like the people in the neighborhood where she 'd been born , still lived and would probably die . Some were even from her neighborhood , the Ridge , as those who 'd grown up in Bay-ridge , Virginia , called it . So were some of the guys on the dock . She was one of them . She knew the value of hard work , too . Day in and day out . She could n't imagine living her life any other way . " Hey , Madison . " The deep , self-conscious voice came from beside her . " What are you doing this Friday night ? " Her smiled moved to the strapping steelworker who 'd asked the same question three weeks running . Eddie Zwicki was tall , cute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own twenty-eight years . " Going to bed early . I have to get up to shop and clean my truck on Saturday so I 'm ready for you guys again next week . " " Do n't you ever go out ? " " Not with my customers , " she replied , her tone kind as she repeated the rule she 'd adopted to save face and feelings . She did n't date anyone , actually . As hard as she was working to build her business , she simply did n't have the time . " But , you know what ? " she asked , because he really did seem like a nice guy and there seemed to be so few single ones like that around . " I think you and Tina Deluca would get along great . I told her about you . The kindergarten teacher ? Do you want her number ? " " Can she cook ? " " Your favorite oatmeal cookies are her mother 's recipe . " " Yeah , but can she bake them ? " The guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Eddie gave him a shove . But even as he turned to frown at the guy who 'd just passed him , he became distracted from his consideration of Tina 's lack of culinary talent . As the rumble of quiet conversations around them suddenly tapered to near silence , it seemed the other men were distracted by something , too . Madison stood near the door of her silver truck with its side popped up to serve as an awning . Moments ago she had seen nothing but the men lined four to six deep waiting to make their selections . Now , those men were shifting , booted feet shuffling in the dirt as they parted like a denim-clad Red Sea . " Morning , Mr. Callaway , " said someone from the back of the group . " Morning , sir . " " Hey , Mr. Callaway . " " Hi , guys , " came the deep and cordial reply . " How 's it going this morning ? " The men 's replies to the question were now accompanied by an undercurrent of murmurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared . Madison immediately recognized Matt Callaway . He was the tall , commanding-looking gentleman in the suit and hard hat the others greeted with a certain deference . He owned the construction company building the enormous York Port Mall that was currently nothing more than acres of concrete slabs , rebar and steel girders . He was n't alone . With a curious jolt , Madison realized she knew the man with him , too . Of him , anyway . Just as tall , even more imposing , the man earning the stares that ranged from curiosity to envy was Cord Kendrick . ( Continues ... )
