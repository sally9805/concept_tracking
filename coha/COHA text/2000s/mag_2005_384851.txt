As rear-suspension designs are tweaked and modified to fit into ever more specialized niches , it 's becoming increasingly difficult to tell them apart . So before you start leafing through our " Buyer 's Guide " ( page 37 ) , read this . You 'll have a better understanding of the difference between designs such as four-bar and VPP . And at parties you can impress the ladies with your newfound knowledge . Or not . // Spring Loaded 1 * What You 're Looking At SCOTT NITROUS SL 11 , $3,570 ; SINGLE-PIVOT * HOW It Works The single-pivot suspension scheme has many variations ( see four-bar , page 16 ) , but this shows its purest form . The rear wheel moves in an are defined by the swingarm 's pivot location ( A ) . The position of the pivot defines the wheel path . If the pivot 's higher , the wheel path tracks rearward , causing the suspension to extend from pedaling forces . If it 's lower , the wheel path arcs forward , causing the suspension to compress from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swingarm ( B ) , or a linkage may be used to actuate the shock . More info atscottusa.com HIGHLIGHTS Ups : Simple , light Downs : Pedaling and braking forces affect this design more than others , although constant refinement of pivot placement , swingarm construction and shock technology mitigate these factors somewhat . Variations : Santa Cruz Heckler , Mountain Cycle Shockwave 9point5 , Cannondale Prophet , Rocky Mountain RMX , Foes FX 2 * What You 're Looking At KONA DAWG , $1,699 ; FOUR-BAR * How It Works Like the Specialized FSR on page 18 , this is a four-bar design ( " four-bar " is a generic term used to describe any suspension system that 's comprised of four elements ) . However , the location of the rear link ( A ) makes this style of four-bar a very different system than the FSR 's . This design positions the rear link on the seatstay above the rear axle ( B ) , coupling the rear wheel to the swingarm ( C ) . Effectively , this design functions as a single-pivot because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D ) just like the Nitrous on page 14 . The rest of this Kona 's suspension parts do not control wheel path , only shock compression . More Info at konaworld.com HIGHLIGHTS Ups : When compared to a single-pivot , there 's slightly less pedaling and braking effect on the suspension ; four-bar bikes can be made very stiff torsionally , and there 's great flexibility in tuning shock rate . Downs : Pedals and brakes much like a single-pivot without the simplicity . Variations : Jamis Dakar XLT , Trek Session , Banshee Scream , Rocky Mountain Slayer , Diamondback XTS 3 * What You 're Looking At SPECIALIZED DEMO 8 PRO , $4,900 ; FSR * How It Works Though this four-bar design resembles the Kona 's four-bar system ( p. 16 ) , the performance is noticeably different . The rear link ( A ) is on the chain-stay below the center line of the rear axle ( B ) , decoupling the wheel from the swingarm ( C ) . This change means the axle path is no longer defined by the main pivot ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a theoretical ( or virtual ) pivot point , usually ahead of the front wheel , for the rear axle to rotate around . More info atspecialized.com HIGHLIGHTS Ups : Generally , the design least affected by pedaling and braking forces Downs : Lots of parts ; can be difficult to make a full-size run Variations : Ellsworth Truth , Turner Five Spot , Titus Switchblade , Norco VPS Six 4 * What You 're Looking At IRON HORSE AZURE TEAM , $4,300 ; MULTI-LINK * How It Works The swingarm ( A ) is attached to the frame by a pair of links ( B ) . The short links have a lot of leverage , giving the designer a great deal of control over axle path and suspension ratios . This looks a lot like VPP , employed by Santa Cruz and Intense , but there is a key difference : On the multi-link model shown here , both links rotate the same direction while a VPP bike has counter-rotating links ( see p. 20 ) . Also worth noting ( and true of all the suspension designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same suspension design and travel will not ride the same . Tiny changes to shock ratios or pivot locations dramatically alter how a multi-link bike will perform .

DW-Link and Giant 's Maestro show promise . Variations : Giant Reign . Marin Quad , Rocky Mountain ETS-X 5 * What You 're Looking At INTENSE 5.5 EVP , $1,850 ( FRAME ONLY ) ; VPP * How It Works Santa Cruz 's patented ( and licensed to Intense ) Virtual Pivot Point ( VPP ) design does not patent the concept of a virtual pivot point . Every rearsuspension design , except single-pivot types , has a virtual pivot point . Instead , Santa Cruz 's VPP system patents the layout and function of this particular design , which has counter-rotating links ( A ) that allow very complex axle paths . The big deal of this design : Careful manipulation of the axle path allows pedaling forces to hold the suspension at the sag point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sag point . More Info at intensecycles.com HIGHLIGHTS Ups : Efficient pedaling feel regardless of amount of travel ; solid rear triangle Downs : Sensitive to shock setup ; in longer-travel applications some shocks do n't complement the design well Variations : Santa Cruz Blur , Intense M3 6 * What You 're Looking At MAVERICK ML8 , $2,295 ( FRAME ONLY ) ; MONO-LINK * How It Works An aggressive rearward axle path absorbs bumps very efficiently but , generally , pedals very poorly . Maverick 's clever idea is to suspend the cranks ( A ) independent of the front and rear triangles and have them move slightly rearward as the suspension compresses . This mitigates chain growth ( as the rear wheel tracks back , so do the cranks ) , giving the rider the benefits of an aggressive rearward axle path , without funky pedaling issues More Info at maverickamerican. com HIGHLIGHTS Ups : Rearward axle path , few parts , elegant design Downs : Backand-forth motion of cranks bothers some riders ; difficult to mount a front derailleur Variations : Seven Duo , Klein Palomino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,300 ; FLOATING BOTTOM BRACKET * How It Works Though it looks different than Maverick 's Mono-Link ( p. 22 ) , the FreeDrive is actually in the same family of suspensions . The FreeDrive and Schwinn 's IsoDrive are both variants of the original GT iDrive design . The function is the same as Maverick's-the bottom bracket ( A ) is independent from the front and rear triangles to minimize pedal feedback . And , though the overall configuration is more complicated than Mono-Link , this alternative execution makes it easier to mount a front derailleur .
