. In the bowels of Procter &; Gamble , one of the country 's biggest , grayest companies , a maverick group is developing the cutting-edge future of the workplace . IF YOU WERE ASKED to name five companies shaping the future of workplace technology , Procter &; Gamble would almost certainly not make your list . From its products to its people , the 170-year-old grand dame of consumer goods is a standard-bearer of the big , corporate , nine-to-five workplace . It produces such supermarket staples as Clairol , Folgers and Old Spice  --  the sort of things given away as consolation prizes on The Price Is Right . And P &G's; Cincinnati-based staff embodies a clean , conservative , Midwestern sensibility ( they 're famously loyal ; most of the company 's top executives have spent enough years with P &G; to merit a gold watch ) . While thousands of researchers plot the Pampers and Pringles of tomorrow , however , a little-known band of futurist thinkers is cooking up something else at P &G:; cockpit-like displays of real-time business data , digital notebooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , venerable companies , with big , antiquated computer systems . And because the company is such a marketplace leader  --  the world 's number-one maker of household products has 22 brands worth at least a billion dollars  --  anything P &G; implements inside its walls today determines what other old-school companies will consider standard business practice in a few years . So when a company this influential and traditional begins to tinker with the future , you know the future 's coming . THE IT DEPARTMENT REMADE Any information-technology ( IT ) worker carries a double burden . No one is better acquainted with a company 's kludgy data management and outdated systems , yet rather than consult on-the-ground IT workers about the big picture , upper management typically ignores them . P &G; has done it differently . In 2003 , as part of a 10-year , $3-billion outsourcing deal , the firm turned over half its IT functions  --  the mundane maintenance stuff  --  to Hewlett-Packard . With a few signatures and handshakes , 2,000 P &G; techies became HP employees . Over the next two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . It reshaped its remaining 4,000-person IT force , recast it as Information and Decision Solutions ( IDS ) , and put Filippo Passerini in charge . Passerini is an IT guy 's dream boss . A native of Rome , he has worked at P &G; for his entire 25-year career , mostly managing IT operations in Europe , the Middle East and Latin America . He 's competent in a way that IT people respect . He has the political gift of remembering names and winning over strangers with a warm handshake and a few words . And for the people who work for him ( especially when your job title makes people think of Star Trek T-shirts ) , it 's nice to have a sophisticated , smooth-talking , trilingual Italian as your protector . Over the past two years , Passerini has eaten group lunches with more than 15,000 P &G; employees , asking the kinds of big-picture questions that almost never get asked : What drives you craziest about the process around here ? If you could have a fantasy tool that made your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passerini , an organization freak who breaks his day into five-minute increments , to make the company tighter , leaner and faster . For a company making toothpaste , air freshener and laundry detergent , having that new Swiffer gizmo out even a few days ahead of a competitor 's version can mean millions of dollars in profit . To that end , Passerini tasked roughly 400 employees  --  20 percent of IDS  --  to develop the IT of P &G's; future . Now IDS employees working in one of several teams spend their days weighing far-out solutions to high-level problems . How can prototyping happen more quickly ? What 's the best way to ensure that no one 's doing the same job twice ? Instead of puzzling over a broken server , IDS techies spend their days puzzling over how workers can be better served , and then they wire the solutions together . In committing money and people to developing future tech , says Lewis Cardin , a senior analyst of IT leadership at Forrester Research , P &G; is unique . " Most CIOs are only able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 , " he says . Passerini 's band of futurists are preparing for problems the other big corporations are n't even thinking about yet . And if other companies are n't watching what Passerini and his people are up to , Cardin says , " they should be . " It may sound like classic start-up enthusiasm , but this is no 30-employee dot-com . When you consider that anything P &G; does must withstand intense legal and corporate scrutiny and work on a tremendous scale  --  140,000 employees in 80 countries  --  what P &G; is trying to pull off suddenly looks a lot gutsier . QUARTERLY REPORTS , HOURLY At a company as large as P &G,; information is like a wave on the shore : It crashes onto the rocks and flows into tide pools and crevasses throughout the company . Some is retained , some is lost forever . If a P &G; marketer in Toronto wants to point out a problem to his boss concerning , say , how many tubes of Crest were sold in Canada last week , he must gather data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outside the company . Only after days of digging can he compile and analyze the resulting data and issue a report to his superior , who adds it to the pile on his desk . Weekly reports , quarterly reports , annual reports  --  they 're just an accepted part of doing business today . IDS is making that mess of papers and conversations tidy , centralized and digital . What if that same marketer could glance at a yellow circle in the lower-left-hand corner of his computer screen at any time and know by its size how well Crest is selling ? While he 's at it , why not give him the ability to see , for instance , in what hours of the day customers bought Crest in Argentina ? P &G; is laying the groundwork for such a system with what it calls " decision cockpits . " The problem with reports , P &G; brand managers told Passerini at lunch , is both the lag time in receiving the data  --  a two-week delay on even simple data requests was not uncommon  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to read and absorb what comes back . In the same way a pilot quickly scans his instruments , P &G; wants to present real-time data in visual form . In the current iteration , a highly sophisticated onscreen display offers information such as bar charts for the market share of a product by country , city or even store , or container information from a port warehouse shipping products abroad . Employees can quickly and easily refine what they 're shown to ensure that the display emphasizes the most useful information . The next step is to link the company 's various distribution channels through radio-frequency identification ( RFID ) tags affixed to crates and products , as companies like Wal-Mart have done so successfully to keep track of their inventory . It 's that interconnectedness that will truly make total corporate awareness feasible . Other companies ( P &G; points to BP , Exxon and IBM ) are also experimenting with cockpits , but P &G; believes that it is planning to use them on an unprecedented scale . An early version has been rolled out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next two years , P &G; hopes to add 30,000 more , and IDS designers are dreaming of a room-size , virtual-reality version in which employees can close the door and study their responsibilities in vivid detail . VIRTUAL PRODUCT TESTING Nothing leaves Procter &; Gamble without high marks from a focus group . At any given time in one of several labs around the world , someone is sniffing a new deodorant , or thoughtfully chewing a stick of a new gum , while researchers take notes on clipboards . For each focus group , P &G; creates several physical samples of its product , which are then refined and tested again . At any consumer-products company , this sort of back-and-forth is part of the process . But P &G; is taking it a step further . IDS created a virtual baby that sits , crawls , and toddles in 3-D while wearing  --  you got it  --  a virtual diaper . " Based on what we know of mechanics , " says IDS 's Keith Caserta , an associate director and head of health care R &D,; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is it going to leak ? " If so , an adjustment to the virtual diaper can happen that same day . " You can test a diaper in hours instead of weeks , " Passerini enthuses . In addition , Caserta points out , virtual testing allows scientists around the globe to collaborate on a product-development project , without the delays and inconvenience of travel . Only at the end of the process does the company need to spend the time and money on creating a tangible version . Today P &G; has four " caves " for testing virtual prototypes and working in 3-D : in Japan , England , Switzerland and Cincinnati . Built inside a black room , each cave is a 10-foot-square cube made of white panels , open on the top and one side . Using high-end stereoscopic projectors , images are projected onto the three walls and the floor . By donning special plastic glasses , visitors to the cube experience the projected world  --  a baby-changing room , a suburban kitchen , a Wal-Mart aisle  --  as if they are physically inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controller . Any beachfront arcade has a virtual-reality game these days . But this VR world has to be real in much more than the virtual sense of the word , responding to the laws of supply , demand , proportion and other logistical limitations imposed on it from all over the company . P &G; engineers also use the caves to design the layout of manufacturing plants and assembly lines . In the future , Caserta says , P &G; scientists will even plot their equations in 3-D and walk around inside the data to ponder it in new ways . SYNCHRONIZED NOTE-TAKING If you 've ever wondered , when your boss handed you an unpleasant project , why someone else could n't have done this , the answer is often that someone already did . Duplicate effort is all too common at big companies , and P &G; estimates that 15 percent of all its research is duplicated work . The waste is extraordinary . Of P &G's; 8,000 researchers , 5,500 regularly record experimental data in lab notebooks , each spending an average of 10 hours per week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these notebooks , so failed experiments wind up buried under thousands of pounds of paper . Rather than dig through it all to see whether the work 's been done before , it 's often easier for P &G; researchers to just repeat the experiment . The company is calling its first step toward tracking these experiments the " electronic notebook " and says it 's already saving each scientist two hours a week in scrawl time . In its current , humble iteration , the " notebooks " are a Web site , used by a test group of 200 researchers to record their work . Once entries are completed , the data is frozen . Any changes must be tracked , key to legally proving who invented what when ( intellectual property is serious business at P &G).; The company plans to expand to 1,000 users by September . In partnership with Plano , Texas-based UGS , the software will be commercially available to anyone in March . Combined with a pen that transmits jotted notes to a computer as digital text , the system could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time archiving every word . The site is an early step toward Passerini 's vision of a transparent , interconnected organization . " If you think about it , " Passerini says , " what holds you to a physical office is your filing cabinet . Why ca n't the digital world match the physical world ? " Using technology similar to that in the prototyping caves , IDS is researching the notion of a virtual filing cabinet , where , by touch or voice command , an employee might flip through sensitive documents , which look as they do in a filing cabinet , and graphically pull out the required one . Related documents would appear to the side of the one you 're " holding , " and , most important , a constant search of the system for related keywords , images and project names would bring up any similar work other employees had already completed . Working for a corporate behemoth , it 's easy to get lost in the day-to-day of the present . But by injecting new , more dynamic visual interfaces at P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become intuitive and helpful parts of the workaday world . " For my grandfather , a refrigerator was breakthrough technology , " he says . " But we do n't even consider that to be a form of technology anymore . It 's just part of our lives . " If P &G; succeeds in popularizing its vision of the visual , searchable workplace , Passerini 's own grandchildren will laugh at the thought of making prototypes by hand or waiting weeks to get back data analysis . Which is n't to say that Passerini 's excitement will be passed on to the next generation . To them , spending the workday fitting giant 3-D diapers onto a virtual baby may be just as mundane as punching the clock at a company that makes toothpaste and laundry detergent .
