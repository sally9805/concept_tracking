<p> Slouching comfortably at a desk in a Boston public high school , James quickly rattles off why sexual abstinence is important to him : " I 'm not ready , I 'm worried about my future , and , " the senior pauses to adjust his hat , " abstinence is cool . " I see girls pregnant , guys crying about how they are going to afford it . I do n't want to go through that , " he adds with a shrug . An increasing number of high school students are taking a stand for chastity , as James is doing , signaling a slight but noteworthy shift in attitudes over the past decade . Though surveys continue to suggest the majority of teens are sexually active , it seems that a growing segment of young people feel that waiting is best - at least until they finish high school . <p> Abstinence is viewed positively by more than three-fourths of teens , according to a 1998 study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation , a health-research organization . And the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 54 percent in 1991 to 50 percent in 1999 . It 's a " movement , " as observers say , driven by separate public and private organizations with a united purpose . On one hand are church groups advocating premarital chastity as a biblical imperative . On the other are conservative efforts to promote abstinence , largely to lower the rates of teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases . The school connection " There is a small segment for whom premarital chastity is exceedingly important , " says Deborah Roffman , author of " Sex and Sensibility : The Thinking Parent 's Guide to Talking Sense About Sex . " For most parents and educators , " abstinence is valued for teens because it 's what 's healthy and developmentally appropriate . " Since 1996 , some $ 440 million in federal-state matching funds has been shelled out to public schools to promote abstinence-only education . That compares with a total of $ 60 million spent from 1981 to ' 96 . As a result , abstinence-only education has increased elevenfold in middle and high schools . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept , and in the 1990s alone , the rate declined 17 percent , mostly because of increased birth-control use , but partly because of abstinence . The Alan Guttmacher Institute says 20 percent of the decrease is due to abstinence . The attitude shift also stems from church groups , who since 1993 have been gaining ground in encouraging kids to sign chastity-until-marriage pledges . Organizations like SHARE , Friends First , and True Love Waits have launched wide-reaching campaigns , throwing rallies at public high schools and in churches from North Carolina and Virginia to California , where teens publicly declare their stand by signing pledges . It 's a commitment that Kylene , of Peru , Ind. , stuck to in high school six years ago - despite pressure from boys and peers . She carried her pledge card with her as a constant reminder , and when she turned 18 , her parents bought her a ring . " There were chances ... Friends tried to convince me , " she says . Senior year , a friend of hers became pregnant and another did n't graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't waited said they wish they had , " she reflects . However , while teens may have the best intentions , not all are able to keep their word . " On one side , you have kids who will be sexually active no matter what . On the other side , there are kids who wo n't . There are a lot of kids in between . The abstinence pledges are affecting this group , " says Jimmy Hester , coordinator of Nashville , Tenn. - based True Love Waits , the group that initiated the pledge movement in 1993 . It 's run by Lifeway Christian Resources , an arm of the Southern Baptist Convention and works with 80 religious and school groups . Signing a pledge does seem to act as a deterrent . A recent study by Columbia University showed that the 2.5 million teens nationwide who signed since 1993 were 34 percent less likely to have sex than those who did n't . Pledge takers also delayed having intercourse 18 months longer than those who did not sign . But the study also found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use contraception , perhaps because they had not been taught about it . The pledge was especially effective with 16- and 17-year-olds , but had little impact on teens 18 and older , according to the same study . Researchers say the abstinence movement is largely a social phenomenon : A group identity forms , which fosters the social support needed to undergird commitment . But when too many kids took chastity vows - 30 percent or more - pledging lost its effect because it undermined a sense of being different . " They want to be part of a club , and this provides it . It 's positive peer pressure , " says Mr. Hester of True Love Waits . " The written agreement helps me ... It 's something I can point to , " says Brian Hiatt of McGrawsville , Ind . But many teens do n't share the view that waiting is best . Jaymie , a senior at a Boston public high school , thinks sex should be a normal part of relating in high school . " The choice depends on who you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do n't , " he says . But he adds , " I 've never broken up with someone for that reason . " Kylene , now a college graduate , says that having a network of friends in high school who were pledge takers provided her with support when she needed it . She concedes that while pledging was accepted among peers , she was teased lightly for her stance . Plus , she adds , the " cool " kids did n't always wait . This attitude parallels findings from a study by Seventeen magazine and the Kaiser Foundation that said 9 in 10 teens think it 's best for young people to postpone sex until they are older , but only 57 percent think they will actually wait . Confusion over terminology There 's also the problem of defining " sex . " Studies show that other forms of sexual behavior are on the rise - including an increase in oral sex among high school and middle-school kids . Young people say there are no clear-cut boundaries . Lacking direction about what 's acceptable , many teens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intercourse . Yet adults , who have traditionally focused on pregnancy prevention , rarely address it . " We 've said so long , ' Do n't have sex , do n't have sex , ' ... and the kids thought we meant just intercourse . They have thought that other behaviors are safe , " says Ms. Roffman . " We have n't done our jobs as adults in explaining what we mean . No one 's quite sure what 's OK and not OK with the opposite sex . " Parents also say they do n't feel comfortable discussing topics like oral sex with kids . Most say they address " the birds and the bees " with their children a few years before adolescence , but when it comes to other forms of sex , " we do n't want kids to think about it , " says Phyllis Bowie , a South Carolina mom . " Many parents do n't realize it 's an issue . " Both parents and teens say they 're up against a major influence - an increase in sexual situations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstinence message clashes head-on with these images competing for kids ' attention . In New Orleans , for instance , billboards proclaim : " Virgin : Teach your kids it 's not a dirty word . " Glossy teen magazines and pop stars like Britney Spears try to tout the virtues of " staying pure " amid a flood of sexually charged messages . Media seem to fill the void when parents are n't around , Roffman says . " Parents need to help kids be better adept at interpreting cultural undertones . Scenes in movies and on TV ... kids take them in as truths ; we need to tell them it 's entertainment . We have to ... agree on what we think is the proper context of sexual behavior and point out when those values are not in place , " she says . Teens see that media have a desensitizing effect on how they relate . " Glamorization takes away the baggage and consequences when sex is abused , " says Brian , the Indiana senior . " You see a lot of dysfunctional relationships in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of kids have a messed-up sense of how a relationship should be . " Another problem young people may face are inconsistent guidelines set by liberal , moderate , and conservative groups pushing to get their messages out through schools , media , and events . Many teachers and organizations support the approach of ensuring kids know about birth control , while they also hold out the ideal of abstinence . Others say this method only confuses kids , and they feel abstinence-only education is best . " If you speak about sexual abstinence , how can you talk about contraception on the other side of your mouth ? You take away from your message . We 've got to hold up an ideal to teens , " says Hester . While most parents agree that waiting should be emphasized , many see the abstinence-only approach as too narrow and feel preventative information should be taught as well . The result , they argue , is that students who do n't abstain wo n't know how to protect themselves or wo n't bother . " I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want our kids to be healthy , that is our common ground . But we ca n't leave those who wo n't wait without any information . We 're talking about ... life-altering consequences , " Roffman says . Parents have influence There is , of course , no single approach for every teen . And , in addition to peers , a fundamental influence in young people 's decisionmaking is parents . In fact , the Columbia University study also showed that teens hold off longer if they live in a two-parent home , are religious , have a high self esteem , and are academically involved . Kids and parents see communication as vital , but lacking in a fast-paced world . They acknowledge that busy schedules and less one-on-one time has meant young people learn more about sex from peers , leaving parents - and kids - in the dark about what 's really going on . " There are many empty homes after school , " says Jennifer Brewington of Ellicott City , Md . " So many parents are so busy with careers and families that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " For Ms. Brewington , mother of two teens , moderate supervision has proven helpful . She told her kids a few years before adolescence that sexual behavior was not appropriate for young people . She also talked to them about birth control , how to handle potentially risky situations , and she made them promise not to hang out at friends ' houses if parents were n't there . She says that while supervision has given her kids less opportunity to " deviate , " providing them with a degree of freedom has proven equally important . " You can not follow them everywhere and watch everything they are doing - and you do n't want to , " she says . " You have to let them make their own decisions and their own mistakes . Being too strict can backfire . " But parents should start by setting a positive example themselves , says Greg Hiatt , a pastor and father of four who lives in McGrawsville , Ind. , and has been involved with grassroots religious efforts to promote abstinence . " We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and know that there is acceptance and forgiving when people fail , " the Rev. Hiatt says . " As parents , our job is to raise our kids to make good and wise choices that are their choices , not ours . Many kids are desirous of choosing a right and moral way . We need to give them the confidence that we will stand beside them . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
