<p> Buck Showalter is doing it again . He is breathing and he is building a contending baseball team , so he has his priorities covered . He can keep them covered by constructing and cajoling the Texas Rangers , and trying to go to a World Series , someplace he has never been . <p> The Rangers are already in a rarefied place , where they were not supposed to be : they are challenging for first place in the American League West and for the wild card . After the Rangers unloaded Alex Rodriguez to the Yankees for Alfonso Soriano in an embarrassing salary dump , they were expected to crawl to a fourth straight last-place finish . No A-Rod ? No way . <p> But the Rangers have performed like a revived team , a team that Showalter said was looser , a team that is not centered on one special player . Rodriguez has left . But Showalter , whom Rodriguez has called a former manager but not a friend , has not . There are no power struggles this season . Showalter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have a thing with the coaching staff where we say , ' Let 's go out and see what the boys have in store for us tonight , " ' said the 48-year-old Showalter , who is in his second season with the team . " They 've never ceased to let us down . " <p> The Rangers , who begin a three-game series with the Yankees tonight in Arlington , have lost four straight after a 7-3 defeat in Baltimore yesterday . And realistically , they should not be in a postseason hunt . Even Showalter admitted that the pitching-starved Rangers ( 60-50 ) are at least a year away from being the polished product that he and General Manager John Hart have envisioned . <p> The Rangers have used a whopping 15 starting pitchers this year , including such luminaries as Scott Erickson and Mike Bacsik . Only one team in the last 35 seasons has used as many starters and reached the postseason , the 1989 San Francisco Giants . And Texas ' rotation turnstile will probably not stop at 15 . <p> But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the best infield in baseball , a nice blend of energetic , young players and responsible veterans , and a manager whose fingerprints are all over the team . <p> " You have to say he 's a big part of what we 've done because he 's involved in pretty much every aspect of what 's going on , " pitcher Kenny Rogers , who leads the team with 13 victories , said of Showalter . " If there 's a detail to cover , he covers it . However insignificant something is , he does n't let it go without being prepared for it . " <p> Essentially , Showalter has not changed from when he worked 14-hour days , or maybe it was 16 or 18 , and helped build the Yankees into the team that eventually won a world championship in 1996 . Then Showalter did the same for the Arizona Diamondbacks , who won it all in 2001 . In both instances , there was no joy for Showalter because he left or was dismissed one season before the teams won those World Series titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Showalter , and the absence of credit for setting the foundations for both championships was sometimes exasperating . It must rankle Showalter that Yankee Manager Joe Torre and Arizona Manager Bob Brenly won titles in their first seasons , titles that were so close to being glitzy lines on his own resume . <p> " You look at the teams he 's been with and he leaves , and all of a sudden , they win the World Series , " reliever Jeff Nelson said . " I 'm not taking anything away from Joe Torre or Bob Brenly , but he leaves and then they win . He did have something to do with it . " <p> Then Nelson added , " It 's almost like there 's a time where it 's got to be his turn . " <p> As Showalter waits and works for his turn , he is obsessive and organized , clever and paranoid . During a stop-and-go , one-hour interview in the manager 's office at Camden Yards on Friday , Showalter went from answer to answer and avoided lingering on topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of a feisty team that believed in itself , even as the Rangers have hobbled to an 11-13 record since the All-Star Game break . Showalter said the players followed his most vital rules : Give your best effort every day . Care about your teammates . Think of how your words and actions reflect on yourself and the organization . <p> " They do n't get involved in trends , like , just because this happened , this is going to happen , " Showalter said . <p> If the Rangers studied trends , they might have wondered themselves silly about how they would perform after dealing Rodriguez , the player who is often called the best in baseball . Without him , the Rangers have flourished . Showalter said he would " love to have Alex here , " which would probably make Rodriguez laugh . <p> " We miss him , " Showalter said . " Where we are as an organization , we had to go in that direction . " <p> Once Texas moved in that direction , Showalter said , the players realized they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded Rodriguez at shortstop , said , " This team took a lot of pride in turning this around from the get-go . " <p> Young , Soriano and third baseman Hank Blalock were all named to the All-Star Game this year ; first baseman Mark Teixeira , who was not , leads the team with 26 homers . Center fielder Laynce Nix is a dynamic player and closer Francisco Cordero has 33 saves in 35 chances for a bullpen that is 23-10 with a 3.59 earned run average . <p> " They 've fixed the bullpen , " Rogers said . " We 've shown how significant that can be . " <p> Showalter credited Hart for not panicking and trading young talent for an ordinary starter . He lauded the pitching coach , Orel Hershiser , and the bullpen coach , Mark Connor , for cobbling together a staff whose 4.57 E.R.A. is a shade worse than the Yankees ' 4.49 . <p> Connor likened Showalter 's skills to the team owner Tom Hicks 's business acumen . Hicks 's investment firm specializes in leveraged acquisitions in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showalter is working on his third reclamation project as a manager . <p> Showalter said he disliked the theory that he was best suited to building a young team and hated the notion that he was a control freak . That notion has been linked to Showalter since his first game , and it will stay with him until his final game . <p> " I 've learned to take it better , " Showalter said about his reputation for wanting to be in control . " You know what else I 've learned ? Some of it might be right . " <p> Rogers , Nelson and Soriano praised Showalter . When Rogers was asked if all players were receptive to such a hands-on manager , he said : " Probably not . Some are n't , I guess . " <p> But Rogers quickly added that the Rangers were receptive . " This is the right kind of team , a team of hungry young guys sprinkled with some old , slow veterans , " he said . " The main part of the team is the young group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game is supposed to play , partly because of how Buck has prepared them . " <p> The preparation began on the first day of spring training , when the Rangers piled onto buses like a high school football team and journeyed to the Luke Air Force Base in Glendale , Ariz . The Rangers sat in the room where F-16 pilots received their instructions before going to Afghanistan . <p> Showalter had the players watch a videotape he had prepared about the history of the Rangers . He interspersed scenes from inspirational movies like " Hoosiers " and motivational music with team highlights . <p> Showalter went to the videotape after the All-Star Game , too . The focus switched from tradition to expectations , and Showalter reminded the Rangers " of what could be " in an already surprising season . <p> The paucity of starting pitching is a weakness the Rangers may not be able to continue camouflaging . Showalter was told that most people doubt the Rangers will win the West or the wild card ; Texas now trails the Oakland Athletics , who lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded , " I 'd probably say the same thing if I was them . " <p> But what does Showalter really believe will happen ? <p> " What do you think I think when I go home at night ? " he asked . <p> When a reporter answered that he probably thought the Rangers could make the postseason , Showalter did not offer another word . He just smiled a confident smile . He was still breathing , still building . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
