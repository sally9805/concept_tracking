Go Carolina ANYONE WHO WATCHES EVEN THE SLIGHTEST amount of TV is familiar with the scene : An agent knocks on the door of some seemingly ordinary home or office . The door opens , and the person holding the knob is asked to identify himself . The agent then says , " I 'm going to ask you to come with me . " They 're always remarkably calm , these agents . If asked " Why do I need to go anywhere with you ? " they 'll straighten their shirt cuffs or idly brush stray hairs from the sleeves of their sport coats and say , " Oh , I think we both know why . " The suspect then chooses between doing things the hard way and doing things the easy way , and the scene ends with either gunfire or the gentlemanly application of handcuffs . Occasionally it 's a case of mistaken identity , but most often the suspect knows exactly why he 's being taken . It seems he 's been expecting this to happen . The anticipation has ruled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . You 're sometimes led to believe that this person is actually relieved , but I 've never bought it . Though it probably has its moments , the average day spent in hiding is bound to beat the average day spent in prison . When it comes time to decide who gets the bottom bunk , I think anyone would agree that there 's a lot to be said for doing things the hard way . The agent came for me during a geography lesson . She entered the room and nodded at my fifth-grade teacher , who stood frowning at a map of Europe . What would needle me later was the realization that this had all been prearranged . My capture had been scheduled to go down at exactly 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon . Theagent would be wearing a dung-colored blazer over a red knit turtleneck , her heels sensibly low in case the suspect should attempt a quick getaway . " David , " the teacher said , " this is Miss Samson , and she 'd like you to go with her now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? I ran down a list of recent crimes , looking for a conviction that might stick . Setting fire to a reportedly flameproof Halloween costume , stealing a set of barbecue tongs from an unguarded patio , altering the word on a list of rules posted on the gymnasium door ; never did it occur to me that I might be innocent . " You might want to take your books with you , " the teacher said . " And your jacket . You probably wo n't be back before the bell rings . " Though she seemed old at the time , the agent was most likely fresh out of college . She walked beside me and asked what appeared to be an innocent and unrelated question : " So , which do you like better , State or Carolina ? " She was referring to the athletic rivalry between the Triangle area 's two largest universities . Those who cared about such things tended to express their allegiance by wearing either Tar Heel powder blue , or Wolf Pack red , two colors that managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference was common in our part of North Carolina , and the answer supposedly spoke volumes about the kind of person you either were or hoped to become . I had no interest in football or basketball but had learned it was best to pretend otherwise . If a boy did n't care for barbecued chicken or potato chips , people would accept it as a matter of personal taste , saying , " Oh well , I guess it takes all kinds . " You could turn up your nose at the president or Coke or even God , but there were names for boys who did n't like sports . When the subject came up , I found it best to ask which team my questioner preferred . Then I 'd say , " Really ? Me , too ! " Asked by the agent which team I supported , I took my cue from her red turtleneck and told her that I was for State . " Definitely State . State all the way . " It was an answer I would regret for years to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Yes , State . They 're the greatest . " " I see . " She led me through an unmarked door near the principal 's office , into a small , windowless room furnished with two facing desks . It was the kind of room where you 'd grill someone until they snapped , the kind frequently painted so as to cover the bloodstains . She gestured toward what was to become my regular seat , then continued her line of questioning . " And what exactly are they , State and Carolina ? " " Colleges ? Universities ? " She opened a file on her desk , saying , " Yes , you 're right . Your answers are correct , but you 're saying them incorrectly . You 're telling me that they 're colleg eth and univeritie th , when actually they 're college s and univer s itie s . You 're giving me a th sound instead of a nice clear s . " Can you hear the di s tinction between the two different s sound s ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual an s wer ? " " Uh-huh . " " ' Uh-huh ' i s not a word . " " Okay . " " Okay what ? " " Okay , " I said . " Sure , I can hear it . " " You can hear what , the di s tinction ? The contra s t ? " " Yeah , that . " It was the first battle of my war against the letter s , and I was determined to dig my foxhole before the sun went down . According to Agent Samson , a s tate c ertified s peech therapi s t , " my s was sibilate , meaning that I lisped . This was not news to me . " Our goal i s to work together until eventually you can s peak correctly , " Agent Samson said . She made a great show of enunciating her own sparkling s 's , and the effect was profoundly irritating . " I 'm trying to help you , but the longer you play the s e little game s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman spoke with a heavy western North Carolina accent , which I used to discredit her authority . Here was a person for whom the word pen had two syllables . Her people undoubtedly drank from clay jugs and hollered for Paw when the vittles were ready so who was she to advise me on anything ? Over the coming years I would find a crack in each of the therapists sent to train what Miss Samson now defined as my lazy tongue . " That ' s it s problem , " she said . " It 's ju s t plain lazy . " My sisters Amy and Gretchen were , at the time , undergoing therapy for their lazy eyes , while my older sister , Lisa , had been born with a lazy leg that had refused to grow at the same rate as its twin . She 'd worn a corrective brace for the first two years of her life , and wherever she roamed she left a trail of scratch marks in the soft pine floor . I liked the idea that a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thoughtless or hostile , just unwilling to extend itself for the betterment of the team . My father often accused my mother of having a lazy mind , while she in turn accused him of having a lazy index finger , unable to dial the phone when he knew damn well he was going to be late . My therapy sessions were scheduled for every Thursday at 2 : 30 , and with the exception of my mother , I discussed them with no one . The word therapy suggested a profound failure on my part . Mental patients had therapy . Normal people did not . I did n't see my sessions as the sort of thing that one would want to advertise , but as my teacher liked to say , " I guess it takes all kinds . " Whereas my goal was to keep it a secret , hers was to inform the entire class . If I got up from my seat at 2:30 , she 'd say , " Sit back down , David . You 've still got five minutes before your speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd say , " David , do n't forget you have a speech therapy session at two-thirty . " On the days I was absent , I imagined she addressed the room , saying , " David 's not here today but if he were , he 'd have a speech therapy session at two-thirty . " My sessions varied from week to week . Sometimes I 'd spend the half hour parroting whatever Agent Samson had to say . We 'd occasionally pass the time examining charts on tongue position or reading childish s-laden texts recounting the adventures of seals or settlers named Sassy or Samuel . On the worst of days she 'd haul out a tape recorder and show me just how much progress I was failing to make . " My s peech therapi s " t 's name i s Mi ss Chri ss y S am s on . " She 'd hand me the microphone and lean back with her arms crossed . " Go ahead , s ay it .

If I wanted to spend the rest of my life as David Thedarith , then so be it . She , however , was going to be called Mi ss Chri ss y S am s on . Had her name included no s 's , she probably would have bypassed a career in therapy and devoted herself to yanking out healthy molars or performing unwanted clitoridectomies on the schoolgirls of Africa . Such was her personality . " Oh , come on , " my mother would say . " I 'm sure she 's not that bad . Give her a break . The girl 's just trying to do her job . " I was a few minutes early one week and entered the office to find Agent Samson doing her job on Garth Barclay , a slight , kittenish boy I 'd met back in the fourth grade . " You may wait out s ide in the hallway until it i s your turn , " she told me . A week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bixler , who popped his head in the door and announced that his parents were taking him out of town for a long weekend , meaning that he would miss his regular Friday session . " Thorry about that , " he said . I started keeping watch over the speech therapy door , taking note of who came and went . Had I seen one popular student leaving the office , I could have believed my mother and viewed my lisp as the sort of thing that might happen to anyone . Unfortunately , I saw no popular students . Chuck Coggins , Sam Shelton , Louis Delucca : obviously , there was some connection between a sibilate s and a complete lack of interest in the State versus Carolina issue . None of the therapy students were girls . They were all boys like me who kept movie star scrapbooks and made their own curtains . " You do n't want to be doing that , " the men in our families would say . " That 's a girl thing . " Baking scones and cupcakes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting rose petals for use in a fragrant potpourri : anything worth doing turned out to be a girl thing . In order to enjoy ourselves , we learned to be duplicitous . Our stacks of Cosmopolitan were topped with an unread issue of Boy 's Life or Sports Illustrated , and our decoupage projects were concealed beneath the sporting equipment we never asked for but always received . When asked what we wanted to be when we grew up , we hid the truth and listed who we wanted to sleep with when we grew up . " A policeman or a fireman or one of those guys who works with high-tension wires . " Symptoms were feigned , and our mothers wrote notes excusing our absences on the day of the intramural softball tournament . Brian had a stomach virus or Ted suffered from that twenty-four-hour bug that seemed to be going around . One of the s e day s I 'm going to have to hang a s ign on that door , " Agent Samson used to say . She was probably thinking along the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have read FUTURE HOMOSEXUALS OF AMERICA . We knocked ourselves out trying to fit in but were ultimately betrayed by our tongues . At the beginning of the school year , while we were congratulating ourselves on successfully passing for normal , Agent Samson was taking names as our assembled teachers raised their hands , saying , " I 've got one in my homeroom , " and " There are two in my fourth-period math class . " Were they also able to spot the future drunks and depressives ? Did they hope that by eliminating our lisps , they might set us on a different path , or were they trying to prepare us for future stage and choral careers ? Miss Samson instructed me , when forming an s , to position the tip of my tongue against the rear of my top teeth , right up against the gum line . The effect produced a sound not unlike that of a tire releasing air . It was awkward and strange-sounding , and elicited much more attention than the original lisp . I failed to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk normally , at least at home , where my lazy tongue fell upon equally lazy ears . At school , where every teacher was a potential spy , I tried to avoid an s ound whenever possible . " Yes , " became " correct , " or a military " affirmative . " " Please , " became " with your kind permission , " and questions were pleaded rather than asked . After a few weeks of what she called " endless pestering " and what I called " repeated badgering , " my mother bought me a pocket thesaurus , which provided me with s-free alternatives to just about everything . I consulted the book both at home in my room and at the daily learning academy other people called our school . Agent Samson was not amused when I began referring to her as an articulation coach , but the majority of my teachers were delighted . " What a nice vocabulary , " they said . " My goodness , such big words ! " Plurals presented a considerable problem , but I worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for example , became either " a river or two " or " many a river . " Possessives were a similar headache , and it was easier to say nothing than to announce that the left-hand and the right-hand glove of Janet had fallen to the floor . After all the compliments I had received on my improved vocabulary , it seemed prudent to lie low and keep my mouth shut . I did n't want anyone thinking I was trying to be a pet of the teacher . When I first began my speech therapy , I worried that the Agent Samson plan might work for everyone but me , that the other boys might strengthen their lazy tongues , turn their lives around , and leave me stranded . Luckily my fears were never realized . Despite the woman 's best efforts , no one seemed to make any significant improvement . The only difference was that we were all a little quieter . Thanks to Agent Samson 's tape recorder , I , along with the others , now had a clear sense of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but more troubling was my voice itself , with its excitable tone and high , girlish pitch . I 'd hear myself ordering lunch in the cafeteria , and the sound would turn my stomach . How could anyone stand to listen to me ? Whereas those around me might grow up to be lawyers or movie stars , my only option was to take a vow of silence and become a monk . My former classmates would call the abbey , wondering how I was doing , and the priest would answer the phone . " You ca n't talk to him ! " he 'd say . " Why , Brother David has n't spoken to anyone in thirty-five years ! " " Oh , relax , " my mother said . " Your voice will change eventually . " " And what if it does n't ? " She shuddered . " Do n't be so morbid . " It turned out that Agent Samson was something along the lines of a circuit-court speech therapist . She spent four months at our school and then moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before school let out for Christmas . My classrooms were all decorated , the halls everything but her office , which remained as bare as ever . I was expecting a regular half hour of Sassy the seal and was delighted to find her packing up her tape recorder . " I thought that thi s afternoon we might let loo s e and have a party , you and I. How doe s that s ound ? " She reached into her desk drawer and withdrew a festive tin of cookies . " Here , have one . I made them my s elf from s cratch and , boy , was it a me ss ! Do you ever make cookie s ? " I lied , saying that no , I never had . " Well , it ' s hard work , " she said . " E s pecially if you do n't have a mixer . " It was unlike Agent Samson to speak so casually , and awkward to sit in the hot little room , pretending to have a normal conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are your plan s for the holiday s ? " " Well , I usually remain here and , you know , open a gift from my family . " " Only one ? " she asked . " Maybe eight or ten . " " Never s ix or s even ? " " Rarely , " I said . " And what do you do on De c ember thirty-fir s t , New Year 's Eve ? " " On the final day of the year we take down the pine tree in our living room and eat marine life . " " You 're pretty good at avoiding those s 's , " she said . " I have to hand it to you , you 're tougher than most . " I thought she would continue trying to trip me up , but instead she talked about her own holiday plans . " It ' s pretty hard with my fian c in Vietnam , " she said . " La s t year we went up to see hi s folk s in Roanoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s with my grandmother out s ide of Asheville . My parent s ITL will come , and we 'll all try our be s t to have a good time . I 'll eat s ome turkey and go to church , and then , the next day , a friend and I will drive down to Jack s onville to watch Florida play Tenne ss ee in the Gator Bowl . " I could n't imagine anything worse than driving down to Florida to watch a football game , but I pretended to be impressed . " Wow , that ought to be eventful . " " I wa s in Memphi s la s t year when N C State whooped Georgia fourteen to s even in the Liberty Bowl , " she said . " And next year , I do n't care who 's ITL playing , but I want to be s itting front-row c enter at the Tangerine Bowl . Have you ever been to Orlando ? It 's a super fun pla c e . If my future hu s band can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move down there within a year or two . Me living in Florida . I bet that would make you happy , would n't it ? " I did n't quite know how to respond . Who was this college bowl fanatic with no mixer and a fianc in Vietnam , and why had she taken so long to reveal herself ? Here I 'd thought of her as a cold-blooded agent when she was really nothing but a slightly dopey , inexperienced speech teacher . She was n't a bad person , Miss Samson , but her timing was off . She should have acted friendly at the beginning of the year instead of waiting until now , when all I could do was feel sorry for her . " I tried my be s t to work with you and the other s , but s ometime sTL a per s on 's be s t ju s t i s n't good enough . " She took another cookie and turned it over in her hands . " I really wanted to prove my s elf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's hard to do your job when you 're met with s o much re s i s tan c e . My student s do n't like me , and I gue ss that 's ju s t the way it i s . What can I s ay ? A s a s peech teacher , I 'm a complete failure . " She moved her hands toward her face , and I worried that she might start to cry . " Hey , look , " I said . " I 'm thorry . " " Ha-ha , " she said . " I got you . " She laughed much more than she needed to and was still at it when she signed the form recommending me for the following year 's speech therapy program . " Thorry , indeed . You 've got some work ahead of you , mi s ter . " I related the story to my mother , who got a huge kick out of it . " You 've got to admit that you really are a sucker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my speech classes ever made a difference , I still prefer to use the word chump.
