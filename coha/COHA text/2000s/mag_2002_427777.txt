Grab some paper , scissors and tape and find out how your bike works . // Ever wonder whether those fancyshaped tubes on your bike really make for a stiffer , more-efficient bike ? Here 's a simple way to find out ( and relive the joy of childhood science projects ) . All you need are a couple sheets of paper , scissors and tape . Cut a sheet of paper lengthwise into thirds . They do n't need to be precise thirds , but the edges should be straight and parallel . Next , take one of these thirds and lay a strip of tape longways down one of the long edges so half of it overlaps the paper . Trim any extra tape from the paper 's short edges , then place the strip on a flat surface with the tape 's sticky edge up and away from you . Roll the strip into a long tube , making it as large in diameter as possible-it should end up slightly larger than an AA battery . Prep another paper strip with tape , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forming a teardrop-shaped tube . Cut another strip in half lengthwise and roll it into a pencil-diameter round tube . Now you 're ready to play . Take your paper tubes and flex ' em ( gently , though-you do n't want them to buckle ) . Smush the round tube into an oval and see how it 's stiffer along the long axis and more flexible along the short one , like the teardrop tube . Notice how the larger round tube is stiffer than the small one . Twist the tubes to check for torsional stiffness , then model some different shapes . Try rolling some tapered tubes and see how stiffness varies along the tube 's length . Granted , this is a pretty simple model , and you ca n't model butting . And paper 's uniform stiffness ca n't imitate the localized stiffness you get from cold-worked metal . But your models show how shape affects structure , and it works because paper , like metal , is isotropic-its strength and stiffness are the same when measured along different axes . Carbon fiber , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses directional stiffness . Shape still matters , but fiber orientation is important , allowing for structural magic like an oval tube that 's stiff along its short axis and flexible along its long one . You can do some limited modeling of how this works by laying thread or dental floss lengthwise onto strips of tape , then applying them to your paper tubes . Changing the strings ' direction changes the tubes ' flex characteristics , and this is basically how carbon engineers manipulate fiber for directional strength . A beautiful , efficient frame can be made exclusively from round tubes , but opening up the palette to other shapes allows for so much more ride-tuning . Ovalized tubes give lateral stiffness while still allowing for vertical ride compliance . Tapered tubes buttress things that need it , like bottom bracket shells , while allowing some wheel travel for shock absorption . It 's hard , cold science , but it 's what determines how your bike rides and feels-giving lifeless materials that emotional , unquantifiable thing we call soul .
