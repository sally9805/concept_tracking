Scott Boras spent five nights last week at the Ritz-Carlton in Key Biscayne , Fla. , and the only palm he saw was the bellhop 's . " I arrived on Sunday and did n't leave the building until Thursday night at 8:30 , when Alex Rodriguez and his nine-months-pregnant wife rescued me and took me to dinner , " says Boras , the baseball superagent who represents the Yankees ' third baseman . " Until then , I was a laboratory rat inside a cage . " // As cages go the Ritz is a sumptuous one , its lobby fragrant with 300 pink roses . Which explains how , while passing through that lobby last week , Boras stopped and -- yes !  - -  smelled the roses . All over the resort , which was hosting the annual meeting of baseball 's general managers , jaws fell open like trapdoors. // That 's because Boras , whose clients include seven of baseball 's most desirable free agents , has the sleep habits of rust . In baseball he 's considered more powerful than Bud Selig , if not nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things , Boras Badenov . Indeed , most baseball owners list him as their least favorite agent , just below Agent Orange . // " I love this perception of agents , " says the 52-year-old Boras , who hates this perception of agents . // " Robert Wuhl is a friend of mine , and he would always ask me to come on his show , Arli$$ "  - -  whose title character is a no-scruples sports superagent . " And I 'd say , ' That 's the last thing in the world I would ever do . I hope your show gets canceled . ' " ( It did. ) // This winter it is Boras 's pitchfork stoking baseball 's hot stove . His free agents include Carlos Beltran of the Astros , Adrian Beltre of the Dodgers , Jason Varitek and Derek Lowe of the Red Sox , Magglio Ordo ? as of the White Sox , Kevin Millwood of the Phillies and J.D. Drew of the Braves . They might sign contracts this winter that are collectively worth half a billion dollars . // Earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Yomiuri Giants , Toshihisa Nishi , for whom Boras is now weighing offers in Japan and North America . In fact , when Boras weighs offers , he really does weigh offers -- on a scale , given the vast stores of loot involved . In 2000 , when ARod signed a 10-year , $252 million contract with Rangers owner Tom Hicks , Boras took 5% , or $12.6 million . " Tom Hicks made a billion dollars as a negotiator , " Boras says , with incredulity , " and people think I hoodwinked him ? " // He continues : " I 'm a guy who played baseball and went to law school . A lot of other agents ' personalities are the sales-leader , schmoozing types . That 's never been my nature . " // Rather , he sees himself as an ex-infielder ( in the Cards ' and the Cubs ' systems ) devoted to getting players their " 53 or 54 percent " of the revenue pie from poverty-pleading owners . He is , in short , part Robin Yount , part Robin Hood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit , players need to benefit too , " says Boras , who then recites , by rote , a litany of figures that suggest Major League Baseball 's revenue stream is , in fact , Amazonian . " People ask , ' Does it always have to be about money ? ' " says Boras . " Well , with owners it does . Ticket prices do n't go down when a team is losing . " Instead , he insists , the average cost per fan -- ticket , food , parking -- has increased from $28 to $51 in the past seven years . // And Boras has great confidence in his figures . To place his clients ' achievements in their proper historical context , Boras employs 15 full-time researchers and keeps a computerized statistical database dating back to 1871 . ( " I 'll ask clients , ' Do you want to be compared to Warren Spahn or Sandy Koufax ? ' " he says . ) The database was set up by a NASA engineer . To Boras baseball is rocket science . So armed is he with statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove his boxes of documents from arbitration hearings with a forklift . // Ask him if , as fans believe , his clients always go to the highest bidder , and he replies , " I 'm so glad you asked . Let 's see : Alex Fernandez signed for seven or eight million dollars less than he could have gotten elsewhere to stay in Florida . Wilson Alvarez signed for 15 percent less to play in Tampa versus a city in the Northeast . Greg Maddux took 25 percent less by not going to the Yankees in ' 93 and instead signing with Atlanta . Bernie Williams could have played in Arizona for 100 million but instead stayed in New York for 90 million . Shall I continue ? " // After five days in Florida , Boras will spend three days visiting clients in Puerto Rico before returning home to Newport Beach , Calif. , and his three children : Natalie , 16 , Shane , 14 , and Trent , 12 . " I 've missed two of Natalie 's tennis matches , " he says with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But first he has business in New York City , whose Yankees Boras nakedly admires . " Without Goliaths , " he says , " baseball would be the NFL , where you have no idea who 's any good until eight games into the season . " He does n't mean to be talking about himself when he adds , " I think Goliaths in sports are wonderful . "
