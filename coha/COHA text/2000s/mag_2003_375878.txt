The majority of breast-cancer patients have radiation therapy as part of their treatment . Lower doses have made it safer than it once was , but radiotherapy still puts healthy tissue at risk . Now a study reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggests that targeted radio-therapy can work just as well as whole-breast therapy in preventing cancer recurrences . The approach , called partial breast irradiation , treats only areas nearest to the tumor , minimizing exposure of healthy tissues to X rays . It can also mean a shorter treatment and recovery period .  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
