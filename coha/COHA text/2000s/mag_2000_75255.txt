The NHL playoffs have become not merely a rite of spring but also a two-month attempt to set things right , an apologia for a troubled regular season . While there have been splotches of vivid color in 1999-2000 , such as Pavel Bure 's 58 goals and thrilling four-on-four play in overtime , the NHL has been mostly spray-painted in ash gray primarily because of a string of stick-wielding incidents , most notoriously Marty McSorley 's Court TV-bound assault on Donald Brashear. // Enter the playoffs . They are boon and balm , rolled into one grand tournament . If the NHL can avoid another screwup like the " no goal " controversy that sucked some of the joy out of the Dallas Stars ' Stanley Cup victory over the Buffalo Sabres last June , and if the hockey is compelling , the banality and boorishness that marred the regular season will recede. // The Western Conference has four titans : the Stars , the Colorado Avalanche , the Detroit Red Wings and the St. Louis Blues . The Eastern Conference has none . The presumptive powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Capitals and the Toronto Maple Leafs  --  all slouched as the season ended , while the Philadelphia Flyers will be without the injured Eric Lindros until at least the middle of the second round . In the meantime the revitalized Sabres could become the first No. 8 seed to reach the Cup finals since the NHL adopted its current playoff format in 1994. // 1 Can anyone stop Pavel Bure ? Having scored 24% of the Panthers ' goals in the regular season , including the game-winning scores in 14 of their 43 victories , Bure ( above ) needs his Florida teammates more than ever because the Devils will cook up a defensive scheme designed to shut him down . Bure , a nine-year veteran , has thrived in the postseason  --  he had 34 goals and 32 assists in 60 career games with the Vancouver Canucks before being traded to Florida last season  --  but he has not had to march through the Eastern Conference , which traditionally plays a more tight-checking style than the Western Conference . // 2 Can the Devils finally win a playoff round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the soon-to-be-sold Devils , normally buttoned-down president and general manager Lou Lamoriello has put a lampshade on his head . He repatriated right wing Claude Lemieux , who was exiled from New Jersey following a contract dispute after his heroics in the 1995 playoffs , which the Devils won ; traded for enigmatic defenseman Vladimir Malakhov , whose self-centered play would usually make him the anti-Devil ; and gambled on erstwhile sniper Alexander Mogilny , whose $5.2 million contract for next season plays against type for salary-conscious New Jersey . The rationale behind those deals : an all-out championship assault to make up for the postseason efforts of the recent past , which have fallen short largely because of a paucity of scoring . Against a suspect Pittsburgh Penguins defense last spring , the Devils had only 18 goals in a seven-game first-round loss ; a year earlier New Jersey scored just 12 goals and fell in six games in the opening round to the Ottawa Senators . // " To score consistently in the playoffs you have to be willing to pay the price , to get in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who took over for the fired Robbie Ftorek on March 23 . Given Mogilny 's inconsistency since being acquired on March 14 , Lemieux , who has appeared in 198 postseason games , becomes the key for New Jersey . The Grate One , as Lemieux is known for his irksome ways , has a springtime knack for the net  --  his .38 goals per playoff game is a better ratio than those of high-scoring Hall of Famers Bobby Clarke , Stan Mikita and Bryan Trottier. // If the Devils ' recent indifferent play continues , Martin Brodeur will have to rehabilitate his image as a big-game goalie . His reputation took a hit in the past two years when his playoff goals-against averages inched above his regular-season marks . But with the talent it has assembled , expect New Jersey to beat the Florida Panthers in the first round . // 3 Will Raymond Bourque finally get his Stanley Cup ? // There has n't been a sentimental favorite like this since Susan Lucci finally won her daytime Emmy , but the Avalanche has more than sentiment in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which closed out the regular season with eight straight wins . Bourque has been a power-play monster , scoring seven of his eight goals with a man advantage since joining the Avalanche on March 6 . With perennial playoff standout Joe Sakic , who had 17 goals in his final 18 games , and 36-goal scorer Milan Hejduk , who tallied six times in 16 postseason matches as a rookie last year , Colorado has ample firepower in the first round to overcome the loss of Peter Forsberg , who is out indefinitely with a separated right shoulder . // Surprisingly , the team 's biggest stumbling block in the later rounds will be in goal . Despite a history that includes 10 overtime wins for the Montreal Canadiens in the 1993 playoffs and three postseason shutouts during Colorado 's 1996 Stanley Cup run , the ever-confident Patrick Roy rarely steals a game anymore  --  a playoff necessity . Roy always embraces a challenge , but right now he is a notch below the Blues ' Roman Turek and Dallas 's Ed Belfour in the Western Conference . // 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag went up around the NHL when Buffalo general manager Darcy Regier acquired center Doug Gilmour to revive a fading club . The Sabres , who won seven of their final 10 games to qualify for the eighth berth in the East , are loaded up the middle with Gilmour , Michael Peca and the underrated Curtis Brown . " How lucky is it to finish first in the conference and have to play the Sabres , with the MVP goalie from two of the last three years ? " St. Louis general manager Larry Pleau asks . " You work hard all year to be Number 1 ; then you play Hasek . I 'd be scared as hell if I played them . " That first-round opponent turned out to be Philadelphia . // 5 Who is the goalie in the Eastern Conference ? Six of the eight starting goalies  --  Brodeur , Ottawa 's Tom Barrasso , Buffalo 's Dominik Hasek , Toronto 's Curtis Joseph , Washington 's Olaf Kolzig ( left ) and Florida 's Mike Vernon  --  have combined to win five Stanley Cups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five Jennings and two Calders , and have made five Olympic teams . But as spectacular as Hasek is and as dominant as Joseph has been in the playoffs ( an average of one shutout for every 9.4 games ) , a snapshot taken today would most flatter Kolzig , a.k.a . Godzilla . Since January he has put the thrilla back in Godzilla , making saves with the self-assuredness he had in 1998 when Washington reached the Cup finals . " Kolzig 's proved himself all year , " says John LeClair , a 40-goal scorer for the Flyers . " He 's really quick for a big goalie. " // 6 Do the Blues have another gear ? // There will come a moment during the playoffs when St. Louis will have to lift its play even beyond the level it attained in putting together the NHL 's best record ( 51-20-11-1 ) . In some way the Blues already have located that gear , going 15-7 in one-goal games , but they must do that in the crucible of spring . // St. Louis boasts Chris Pronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's MVP , the NHL 's hardest-working forwards and solid goaltending from Turek . But pitfalls abound . High-scoring Pavol Demitra is sidelined for most of the first round with a concussion , and the reconstitute Slovak Line , with Ladislav Nagy taking Demitra 's place on the wing , has scored only one goal since his injury on March 24 . While St. Louis has been built around a coterie of veterans such as Pronger , defenseman Al MacInnis and center Pierre Turgeon , it also depends on neophytes like Turek and forwards Nagy , Marty Reasoner , Lubos Bartecko and Michal Handzus . Turek is a goaltending oddity on two counts : It 's unusual that a man his size ( 6 ' 3 " ) prefers to stand instead of dropping into the butterfly style , and he 's a European who handles the puck well . During the season Turek was a model of calm , a disposition that might change  --  Game 1 against the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday will be his first playoff appearance . One final note of caution : In 1999-2000 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in the playoffs to the eventual Cup winner , had a combined 6-7-1-0 record against Dallas , Detroit and Colorado . // 7 Which is the deepest team ? // When the red wings won two straight Cups , in 1997 and ' 98 , they were bolstered by shock troopers like Darren McCarty , who scored the fanciest goal in the ' 97 finals , against Philadelphia ; Martin Lapointe , who had nine goals in 21 playoff games in ' 98 ; and Doug Brown ( right ) and Kris Draper , who had the tying and winning goals , respectively , in Game 2 against Washington that year . " If you look at the years in which we 've had long runs , the scoring has come throughout the lineup , " Detroit general manager Ken Holland says . " That 's a piece of everyone 's Stanley Cup puzzle . " When the Wings flamed out in the second round last year , Steve Yzerman , Brendan Shanahan and Slava Kozlov accounted for 58% of their playoff goals . // Detroit should be bolstered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCarty . The Wings have also been buoyed by the return to good health of Brent Gilchrist , a solid utility forward who had missed 153 games over the past three years with a series of ailments . The depth will benefit Detroit in the later rounds , if it gets there . // 8 Can Dallas overcome the loss of defenseman Sergei Zubov ? // The stars cruised through the first round last year without another key defenseman , suspended captain Derian Hatcher , but Zubov ( above ) is even more important to Dallas than Hatcher was . He not only runs the power play , but he also controls the tempo of the game with his passing . " We 're a lot better in transition with him , " coach Ken Hitchcock says . " We seldom get bogged down . " Zubov is expected to return from the injury to his right medial collateral ligament late in the first round , and with Sylvain Cote , a critical late-season addition , filling in on the point , the Stars should slip past the Edmonton Oilers. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be missing , which could prove to be its undoing . Rarely do the Stars strip an opponent , leave it by the side of the road and sell the parts for scrap anymore . " Last season we would control the tempo of the game and never beat ourselves , " Hitchcock says . " This year we 've had a tendency to make big errors . We 've had to rely on our goalie Belfour even more . We 're a little bit of a mystery now , even to us. " // 9 Will Ottawa 's gamble on Tom Barrasso work ? // Traditionally , the senators have had the most collegial of dressing rooms , John Belushi 's Delta Tau Chi on ice . In the riskiest trade of the year , they added Barrasso , the NHL 's equivalent of Dean Wormer . The opinionated Barrasso can be a difficult person . He can also win a playoff series almost single-handedly , as he proved in Cup-winning years in Pittsburgh ( 1991 and ' 92 ) and in the first-round upset of the Devils last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottawa , which unraveled in the first round last year . " He 's good for us , " defenseman Wade Redden says of Barrasso , who has battled injuries and the emotional turmoil of his father 's death this season . " He 's confident in everything he does . He 'll stand in there , even if we get down . " // " I had dinner with Tommy last week , " said Flyers winger Rick Tocchet , a former Penguins teammate from 1992 to ' 94 . " He 's keyed up , excited about being there . I 've seen him steal games , steal series . Tommy is a great athlete , but he 's also technically sound . Not too many goalies are both . " // 10 So who will win the Cup ? The devils will come out of the East , but before the season we picked Dallas to win it all , so we 'll stick with the Stars .
