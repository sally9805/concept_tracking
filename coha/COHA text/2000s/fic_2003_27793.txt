" Hold , " said Jarhead . He reached back from the driver 's seat as Bobby came near . Bobby was exiting the van . Jarhead grabbed Bobby 's shoulder and said , " You 're doing high jump . " Bobby hated high jump . " Okay , " said Bobby . Jarhead was coach . We called him Jarhead because his head with its crew cut mimicked a mayonnaise jar 's shape . We did n't know " jarhead " was a nickname for soldiers . We were thirteen or fourteen years old , at an eighth-grade track meet in Bryceville . Tonight was the night I was going to win the 800-meter run . I was going to win because Jamie Torffelson was n't there . Jamie Torffelson was a redshirt from Portertown who had run a 2:04  --  two seconds off the Missouri junior-high record . I was the real high jumper , better than Bobby Sickle . But I also ran fast , and tonight Jarhead needed me in the 1600-meter relay , the 3200-meter relay , and , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I could n't do high jump . That was fine . I hated high jump . But then , I hated the 1600-meter relay , the 3200-meter relay , and the open 800 , too . Basically , I hated running and jumping . But I ran fast and jumped high . " You 're headed to state finals next year , " Jarhead had told me . Next year I would be a freshman . " That does n't bother me , " I said . Jarhead was a big fucker . Something like six feet eight . He was blond haired , but his eyebrows were brown . Those were scary , his eyebrows . When he told Bobby Sickle that he was doing high jump , Jarhead nudged his brown eyebrows together in a way that said , " You 're going to do high jump . " It was intimidating , and I felt for Bobby . I was sitting near the back of the van with Ellie Butterbit and Ellie Butterbit 's boobs . Trolley Catchell was back there , too , sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fat . He threw shot put . Jarhead told Bobby he was doing high jump . Bobby tromped off the van and walked past my window , cussing . I admired his vocabulary . He and I were mild rivals only because we were too much alike to be friends anymore . But I had always known that somewhere , somehow , Bobby Sickle was just wrong , just a notch or three below me . This year I had evidence : I was faster , jumped higher , and had Ellie Butterbit . " Would you suck Bobby 's dick ? " I asked Ellie . She threw her sweatshirt at me . I picked it up and smelled it . She laughed . Jarhead stepped out of the van and the van rocked . Ellie was still laughing at me . " He 's one big guy , " Trolley said from his seat . He was lying down , so we could n't see his face . " That 's darn tootin ' , Trolley , " I replied . It 's amazing that Trolley Catchell never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . But then , I was popular , funny , and friendly when appropriate . I was an egomaniac , but I did n't know it . Being an egomaniac did n't bother me . After all , who else had fooled around with Ellie Butterbit ? We were lying on blankets on the slope above the track , talking about how cold it was , saying things like , " It 's really cold , " and " Shit , I 'm going to freeze . " It was me and Ell1ie and Greg French and Heather Garnet and Will Wynsom and Gina Daley and Hoover Garfield . Me and Ellie were keeping warm enough under a blanket , but I went along with the conversation . " Frickin ' - ass cold , " I said . Ellie thought that was funny . Jarhead walked up like a blond-and-blue totem pole . He held clipboards . " Jamie Torffelson is here , " he said . " In the 800 with you . " My best time in the 800 was 2:10 , but I had beaten Jamie last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time I 'd beaten him . Jarhead wanted me to win tonight . He wanted me to smash Jamie Torffelson into the cinders . Jarhead hated Portertown . Jarhead said , " I want you to win tonight . I want you to smash Jamie Torffelson into the cinders . I hate Portertown . " " I 'll win , " I said . " I 'll break 2:10 . " " What size spikes you got ? " asked Jarhead . He crouched down next to me . I had to reach an arm out from under the blanket to check my shoes . " Quarter-inch . " " Well , " said Jarhead , " you 'll do what you do . " " It will be done did . " Our uniforms were blue . We yawned . Daylight saving time had not yet arrived this year , so the sun had set as our team van pulled into Bryceville , and our meet was held beneath the darkness . High schoolers ' cars wheeled through the white-gravel lot beside the track . And why was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the 3200-meter relay as a warm-up , testing my tendons . We placed third after Porterville and Bryceville . I was the anchor , the fastest , and Bobby Sickle ran well , too , but Greg French and Jason Blick were slow , so our relay rarely won . Other than the 1600-meter relay , this was the only relay race our team entered . After the race , I walked through the finish area . Georgia Teeter sneered at me . I blew her a kiss . I walked into the infield , where Jarhead stood alone like an abandoned chess piece . Jarhead had kept our splits in the relay . They were : Jason Blick , 2:32 ; Greg French , 2:31 ; Bobby Sickle , 2:19 ; and me , 2:17 . I had n't been pushing . Jamie Torffelson ran third-leg with a 2:07 . " He 'll wear himself out , " said Jarhead . Then Jarhead told me he was pulling me out of the 1600-meter relay . He put Bobby Sickle in . " We 're keeping you fresh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from anyone , in the middle of the infield . The field lights shone from the dents in his forehead . " How 's the track ? " he asked . " Loose . Dry . " " Oh yeah , " he said , as if loose , dry tracks were the plague of his years . Bryceville had the standard shit-school cinder track . They let us wear quarter-inch spikes . Bryceville was bigger than our school , Carton . My entire class contained sixteen kids . Fourteen of us had joined the track team . Jarhead pulled a white bag from his jacket . " Here , " he said . " Halfinch . No one will notice . " So I sat in the infield and screwed the half-inch spikes into my Nikes while Jarhead stood above me . Then he sent me to the high jump pit to tell Bobby he was running the 1600 relay so I could rest up . " I hate that relay , " said Bobby . He was being real royal about getting all the shit that Jarhead did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . I watched him clear 5 ' 4 " . " Good jump . Nice approach , " I told him , knowing nothing is worse than middling compliments from someone who is better than you . Jason Blick came up . " Hey , " he said to me , " your parents are here . " They were . In the top corner of the bleachers , sitting on their little butt-saver cushions . I went to my parents . " Hey , " I said . " Well , how 's it going ? " asked Mom . She pulled open a cooler . " Okay , " I said . " You already run the 1600 relay ? " asked Dad . He was looking portly . " No . Coach took me out of it to rest up for the 800 . " " Ah . Good , " said Dad . " We 're keeping me fresh , " I explained . Mom handed Dad a **26;183;TOOLONG sandwich . She poured him coffee from a thermos and offered me some . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not for an athlete . " Lying on the blankets again . " Ellie , " I said , " go talk to my parents . " They thought Ellie was so nice and pleasant . Ellie was good with adults . She was smart . " Fine , " she said , and stood up . I heard runners crashing through hurdles . Behind Ellie 's blue sweatpants the track 's rust swath circled the pool-table infield . Beyond that was night , come comfortably up to the chain-link fence . I looked at Ellie 's face . She was smiling at me . One time we had met in the woods between our houses , and she had taken me to the cliffs above the floodplain and shown me how the view encompassed the hills of three counties . Often I had daydreamed of following her on more treks through the woods . We could pack snacks to eat . By road , our houses were four miles apart ; but through the woods only one mile separated us . " When I come back , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " See , we were planning where to live . We were planning our adult persons . " Okay , " I said and clicked my teeth . I watched Ellie 's smile turn and watched her walk with her hands swinging selflessly . Steadily she moved , crossing the track , the infield , and the track again . She rose into the bleachers . I pictured her walking right off the back of the bleachers , but she did n't . As she approached my parents , she opened her arms wide , like Jesus might have done at the end of his " Do n't worry " parables . What was she saying to them ? I wanted her to come walking back . As far as Boston and Montana were concerned , I liked Boston , but knew Ellie wanted Montana . My answer was both . While Ellie visited the bleachers , me and Will Wynsom went behind the restrooms and smoked . Jamie Torffelson walked by with two buddies . I do n't know what they were doing just walking behind the restrooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Jamie . I thought he was talking to Will , who was a genuine loser . But then he stopped in front of me . " It does n't bother me , " I said , exhaling . I should have said , " How does it feel to have a woman 's name ? " but I did n't particularly want to be beaten into pulp . The two things the backs of restrooms were made for : smoking and beating people into pulp . Ellie came back as Will and me walked from behind the restrooms . " You were smoking , " she said . " Mm , let me kiss you ! " I pushed her off . " Kiss Will , " I said . Will smiled . Ellie screamed and slapped my shoulder . I grabbed her ass . It was a lovely thing to do . " How are my fossils ? " I asked . " Your parents are nice , " she said . " You should be nice to your parents . Since my parents were there , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucking with Ellie . Ellie pulled her sweatshirt hood up . She began reading a book by someone dead . Trolley Catchell loped up to our blanket camp and sat on the grass . " How 'd the throwing go , Trolley ? " I said . " Third , " said Trolley . Bobby Sickle approached and sat with Gina Daley . I was the official spokesman . " How 'd the jumping go ? " " Third , " said Bobby . He picked dirt from his spikes and started unscrewing them . He was done for the night . He 'd run a 1:15 in the 1600-meter relay -- a poor time by any measure . Hell , Ellie could run a 1:06 . I could do 59 . " My parents here ? " Bobby asked , looking to the bleachers . We all looked . We were trained to spot parents . At any public event , it gave us great glee to tell another kid that his parents were present . Such news was a subtle slap , and we loved violence . Greg French said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose parents he was insulting . I thought it was the kind of insult I should have gotten to first , but then I realized he was simply offering us a painfully uncreative description of the bleachers . I saw my parents Mobbed together in their parkas . They waved . I saluted them . " Hippy , dippy , do , " someone said . " My parents were supposed to be here , " said Bobby . He actually liked his parents to come to the meets . He actually liked his parents . Publicly . " I have to ride the fucking van , " he said . " Fuckity fuck fuck , " I said . I was getting tired of waiting to win the 800 . " Fellows , all this third-place taking has earned us a smoke . " I looked around at Ellie and Bobby and Trolley and Jason and Greg and Heather and Will and Hoover . They were gazing at their laps . I jumped up . I snapped at Will . He was the one with the cigarettes . He rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve a break . Come on . " " No , " he mumbled . Bobby stood . " Coming ? " I asked . " No doubt . I got something . " Behind the restrooms we lit and dragged . " Fricking-ass cold , " said Will , but no one laughed . " Guys , " said Bobby . " Look at this . " He dug into his jacket , then froze . Jamie Torffelson and two guys had come around the corner . One of the guys had a mustache . We did n't say anything , and they did n't say anything , but they came right up to us where we stood against the white cinder-block wall . A toilet flushed inside . It made me bold . I said , " I 'm going to break 2:10 . That would leave you in second , I guess . Or third . " Jamie 's face fluttered . At my side , I felt Will cringe -- he hated a fight . Jamie shuffled a bit and looked over his shoulder . Then he pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . This was true , I admit . It was true . " What ? " said Bobby , and he dropped his cigarette . " You want to say that again ? " I kept smoking , slowly . Tact , I felt , was the key . " Come on guys , " I said . " I have a race to win . " I snuffed my cigarette with my heel . " No way , " said Bobby . " I want this prick to repeat what he just said so I can smash his face in . " " I 'd love to , buttfucker . " I put my forearm across Bobby 's stomach . " Come on , " I said . " No fucking way . " " Give me a cigarette , boys , " said someone . I looked . It was Trolley Catchell , walking like a barrel , looking like a fortress , coming around the corner . " Give me a cigarette . " Will gave him a cigarette . Will was smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamie 's crew . " No , " said Jamie , and he left with his friends . I scratched my eyebrow , put one foot up on the wall behind me . " I saw them come back here , " said Trolley , pill-rolling his Camel . He dropped it without even lighting it . He stepped on it . " Come on , they did first call for the 800 . " I waited for Bobby to thank me . When he did n't , I followed Trolley . The hair on my legs rose . The night was fifty degrees . I rubbed my calf muscles . " Let me do that , " said Ellie . " For good luck . " I let her do it . Jarhead came up and smiled and said , " This is going to be good . This is going to be just fine . " " Good , " I said . " Fine . " Keep moving before the start , " he said . " Keep jogging in place . This cold will lock your muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , Mister Coach Master , sir . " " Good , " he said . " Fine , " said I. Then I had to piss . I ran into the restroom . I ran out , jiggling my arms to loosen them , and Bobby came up . We jogged toward the starting line along the back part of the track . It was silent but for our footfalls . " Let me run it , " said Bobby . " No way . I 'm going to break 2:10 . " " Shit , " he said . He held something out to me . It was two joints . We had smoked pot a couple times , but did n't know who to get it from regularly . " Where the hell . . . ? " I asked . " Some kid over by concessions . " I smelled the joints . They were real . " You can have them , " said Bobby , " if you let me run this race . I want to blow Jamie Torffelson 's ass away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , but then I thought about next week 's dance , and how it would be great to smoke with Ellie , and so on . I did n't care what Jarhead thought . I would quit the team if he wanted . I hated running and jumping anyway . " Okay , " I said . " Give me your spikes , " he said . " I already took mine out . " We sat on the track , traded shoes , then continued toward the starting line , wordless . " Carton , Kevin Schuler , " said the starter , " lane six . " Bobby stood in lane six . I looked around for Jarhead . He was on the far side near the finish line . The track was n't standard size , so 800 meters was n't two laps , but one and two-thirds . " Hold your dicks , boys , " said the starter . " I need caps . " A bouncing girl ran across the infield for more starter caps . Bobby motioned to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us pointing at Bobby . Jarhead yelled . The bouncing girl ran past Jarhead and handed the caps to the starter ; he threw one in , stood back , signaled the timers , said " Mark ! Set ! " and shot . Then a wild thing happened : Bobby pulled out front , and when the lanes fell in he was in second , just off Jamie Torffelson 's shoulder . Jarhead stopped beside me , his head panning like a naval cannon , his lips loose and open just wide enough to hold a budding rose . As it quickly became apparent that Bobby was going to do fine , he said , " That 's you out there . " " That 's me , " I agreed . " You 're doing good , " he said . " I 'm doing well , " I corrected . Bobby stayed with Jamie around the first lap . He passed me and Jarhead . I checked the split on Jarhead 's stopwatch . It was too fast for Bobby to hold . Jarhead did n't even check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed . I followed Jarhead across the infield toward the finish line . I watched Bobby and Jamie . Bobby hugged Jamie 's shoulder , moving up . I was almost impressed . But Jamie held him out on the curve . Then , as they hit the stretch , they were both tripping , windmilling , kicking up arcs of cinders . Jamie crashed . Bobby went on . He looked behind him as he sprinted in at 2:01 . Jarhead threw his clipboards into the bleachers and shook Bobby . " God damn yes ! " he screamed . " God damn yes ! " When Jarhead released Bobby I expected him to crumple like canvas to the track , but he stood straight . He put his hands on his head , laced his fingers together . I cut toward him through the pack of coaches and timers . He was breathing through his nose . I saw he had more underarm hair than I did . " Nice scuffle , " I said . Someone called for the official finish time . A timer referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Schuler . " It was then I realized that I , Kevin Schuler , now held the state record for the 800-meter run . It was my first record , and my easiest . An official pulled Jarhead away . " Bring the runner , " said the official , pointing to Bobby . I followed . Suddenly , Ellie had her arm around me . I did n't care about anything right then except her . I wanted to tell her about the joints in my pocket . " Your runner spiked Jamie , " said Porterville 's wiry coach . Jarhead shook his head . He said , " Your boy tripped him as he tried to pass . " The starter and three officials and several coaches and runners huddled around . Sitting on the ground , thirty meters up the track , Jamie Torffelson had wide gashes above his right ankle . Cinders and blood colored his knees and palms . As we watched , two EMTs wearing latex gloves lifted him and led him away . " Do n't let them trick you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jarhead . " Your runner tripped my runner . It was clear if you were watching . " " It 's true , " said someone . All heads turned . It was my father , hands resting on his yellow binoculars . " I saw the Porterville runner trip Carton 's boy , " he said . There was silence . " Now wait , " said the starter . He was the starter at all the local meets . " Is n't this kid "  - -  he pointed to me=- " Kevin Schuler ? " " Uh , no , " said Jarhead . He put his hand on Bobby 's shoulder . " This is . " No heads moved . The starter crossed his arms . Bobby bent over . I stepped out , pulling Ellie with me . She was smiling at my side . " Look , " I said , " his shoes . " We all looked . Even Bobby looked . His shoes , indeed . There were stripes of blood on the left toe . And below , an inch from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spikes that had cut Jamie Torffelson . I knew they would not be seen , but I knew they were there . I new a thing the world did n't . But what the world saw was notable : Across the heel of the spikes , written in my mother 's round script , was K. Schuler . Ellie squeezed my side . The starter nodded . " Okay , " he said , " all right . The record stands and we can go home . No need to dawdle in this flipping cold if we do n't have to . " " Frickin ' - ass cold , " I said , and a few people laughed . Everyone turned and left . Ellie rubbed her head against my neck . I rode with my parents in the beige sedan . We followed the van to McDonald 's , and then passed by . I understood : The Porterville bus was already there . We headed to Hardee 's . " Best eatin ' in town , " said my dad . Mom laughed . I told them that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituted Bobby . " Cramps , you know . Crazy . " " You can win next week , " said Mom . Dad nodded as we pulled into Hardee 's behind the van . I kept worrying that someone would moon us if we followed the van too much . Dad said , " I know what a raw deal it must feel like to get pulled at the last moment from the race you were going to win . I know that 's no fun . " " It did n't bother me , " I said . My parents respectfully made themselves scarce in Hardee 's . I showed Ellie the joints and she kissed me . " I 'm kissing you , " she said , " not the joints . " Our team had placed last in the meet , but all we cared about now was food and warmth and each other . " We 're not much as a team , " I admitted to Ellie . " Come on , " screamed Jarhead , " we have to get home before midnight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellie kissed me and I sucked on her neck and she pushed me off and looked at my face intently . We stood so close together that to focus on my face she had to cross her eyes . I said , " I remember when you brought that hen to the egg drop contest . Fourth grade . " " I did , " she said , and bit her bottom lip . " Back in those days when I was shy . " " You 're still shy , " I said . I poked her navel . " We were up on the bleachers , " I whispered , " and Miss Palmer was about to throw the hen and I had this sudden anxiety . I worried that the hen might not fly . Might get hurt . And I looked over at you , and I knew you were having the same last-minute worries . " " I thought I was a monster , " Ellie said . " I took this hen from her quiet life and was about to throw her off the bleachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ellie said : " Floated down . " " I 'll tell , " I said , " what I saw : not that the hen fell , but that the earth rose to hold her . " Jarhead leaned from the van door . " In the vans " he yelled . Ellie kissed me and turned away . " Call me , " she said . It was a thing we did : call each other at two or three in the morning . I pulled her back . I said : " Montana . " I sat in the back of the sedan and Dad drove behind the van . " Coach Reese is speeding , " he said , chuckling . " Pass ' em , " I said . Mom slept . I was still worried about someone mooning us . " Pass ' em before the bridge , " I said . Dad passed them on a straight stretch , immediately before the bridge . Mom woke up . " Slow down for the bridge tonight , " she said . The bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells . I looked up the moonlit Osage . It was a wide river . The bridge was high . I wondered if this was the bridge from which you could see all the way up to Bagnel Dam . I lay down , not worrying about mooning anymore , and dozed . I called Ellie 's house that night at two . Her dad answered . " Officer ? " he asked . " There , you see , " I whispered to Trolley Catchell as he lay wrapped in gauze and dry sheets a week after the meet , " we 're it now . We 're the ones . We 're the products . We 'll go on to show the world . " But despite his cushiony mass  --  the weight that buffered him from the bent van seats and the bones of his teammates  --  he died too . In the sleepless nights of April and May I sat and counted the things I had lost : my spikes , my team , my girlfriend , my coach . I imagined the thrashing and bubbling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wobble of Trolley Catchell floating to the surface . Soon enough , midsummer , I counted the things I 'd gained : two joints , one state record , and Bobby Sickle 's training shoes . What bothered me : When you 're at the top , there is nothing above . " Do n't look down , " they say to people who fear heights . Went my new motto : " Do n't look up . " I feared depths .
