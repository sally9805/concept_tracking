Colin Montgomerie says I he has a problem and , like a certain U.S. president , it has to do with his legacy . Montgomerie , 37 , has been a good golfer for a long time . He has led the European tour in earnings for an unprecedented seven straight years . He has 34 victories worldwide . He has n't lost a singles match in five Ryder Cups . Yet because he has won neither a major nor any Tour event in the U.S. , Montgomerie is worried that he wo n't be remembered as a great golfer . // Montgomerie recently concluded that the odds on filling the holes in his r ? sum ? will go down if his appearances in the U.S. go up , for two reasons : the law of averages and the benefits of playing on a more competitive tour . The latter was driven home last month at the Standard Life Loch Lomond in Glasgow , where he was outplayed down the stretch by Ernie Els and Tom Lehman . " It was a bit of a wake-up call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes players that little bit tougher . " The point was reemphasized the next week at St. Andrews , where U.S. players dominated the British Open and Montgomerie , tense and pressing , finished 26th. // Montgomerie knows what he needs to do , but here 's the catch : He abhors playing in the States . He has been scarred by the years of fan abuse and is angry at CBS analyst David Feherty for making fun of him on television . " Feherty has a lot to answer for , " says Montgomerie . " Americans think his Irish humor is funny , but we see through it . " // In his current state of mind it 's all Montgomerie can do to come to America for the three majors . " It 's hellish , " he says of the heckling . " Very , very difficult to put aside . It has almost gotten to the point where I know if I got into contention , I could n't possibly get over that hurdle and win . The emotional hurdle would be 10 times higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first player to go through something like this . Jack Nicklaus was hammered by Arnie 's Army . Gary Player had it even worse . Anti-apartheid protesters threw ice at him , heckled him and , during the 1969 PGA , tried to assault him on the course . Player almost won that tournament . " I dealt with it by not fighting back , " he says . " I did n't fight fire with fire . " If Montgomerie is truly concerned about his legacy , he must respond as Nicklaus and Player did . He needs to get tough . // Montgomerie 's capable of it . During the Ryder Cup at Brookline , he got so mad at the jeering fans that he turned stoic , and silenced the crowd by making putt after crucial putt . But more often he 's undone by the hecklers . He mopes , he sulks , he has fans ejected . ( He reportedly had eight spectators removed at Pebble Beach during the U.S. Open . ) The bottom line is that Montgomerie is soft . Being impervious to spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why the other players roll their eyes when they hear him complain . Montgomerie is losing this game , and the more he insists that he 's a victim , that he deserves justice , that he 's in the right , the more he 's in the wrong . " Colin is smart , but nobody likes a smart-ass , " says his agent , Guy Kinnings . " He has to learn that sometimes there are more important things than being right  --  like being happy . " // To achieve that blessed state Montgomerie must do two things . First , he has to suck it up and roll with the punches , fair or not . ( Is n't that the first lesson of golf ? ) Second , he should come to the U.S. Every top international golfer who has played long stints in America has been better off for it  --  from Bobby Locke to Nick Faldo . As great as Seve Ballesteros was , he would have been greater had he played the PGA Tour . Same goes for Jos ? Mar ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut . It 's not too late to change your legacy . Ten years from now you may not have won your major or even a Tour event . You may not have enjoyed your time over here . But when you 're making an accounting of your career , at least you 'll be able to say that you did n't leave anything in the bag .
