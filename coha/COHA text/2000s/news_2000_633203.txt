<p> I take strong exception to your cynical editorializing of the events surrounding my actions in the Illinois Senate on Dec. 29 as lawmakers debated the Illinois Safe Neighborhoods Act ( Steve Neal column , Dec. 31 , and editorial , Jan. 2 ) . <p> I would have voted for Gov . Ryan 's compromise plan that would have reinstated the felony penalty for unlawful use of a weapon , with the opportunity for some first-time offenders to have their records wiped clean after a certain period . I voted for the original bill in 1994 , and voted against weakening the felony provision in 1998 . In addition , I voted in favor of Ryan 's first failed attempt to re-enact the bill on Dec. 17 . <p> I spent 10 days working with Senate leader Emil Jones Jr . to round up Democratic votes for Ryan 's proposal . The presiding officer at the time of the Dec. 29 vote , Sen. John Maitland , permitted senators less than a few seconds to record their votes  --  an unusually swift roll call by normal Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not recorded because of this . <p> Many senators , myself included , changed travel plans to be in Springfield for this vote . Why would I , or any other senator for that matter , change travel plans during the holiday season to travel to Springfield and not vote on this important bill when given the opportunity ? My vote was not recorded for one reason alone : My switch malfunctioned and the presiding officer resorted to a speedy roll call . <p> I am infuriated that you or anyone else would suggest that I was derelict in my duty by not voting for this bill . I am on record as having supported this tough felony provision in the past , and the electronic voting board in the Senate should have recorded me as voting in favor of the bill . For reasons beyond my control , the board did not record my vote . <p> Sen. James A. DeLeo <p> ( D-Chicago ) <p> ufvoxppA mere setback <p> While I applaud your thorough coverage of the Decatur school expulsion federal case this week , I beg to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court 's opinion as a " stinging defeat " for the Rev. Jesse Jackson . That case is destined to be appealed , and the highlighted issues of correlated disproportionate minority expulsion , school dropout rates and encounters with the criminal justice system have socio-political ramifications that will remain a part of our national discourse . <p> In regard to the court 's decision , three things are clear in this case . First , even the court acknowledges that it was in the reduction in expulsion from two years to one with alternate education , facilitated by Jackson and others , that allowed the court to forgo adjudication of the proportionality of the original punishments . Second , the appellate process will facilitate a reconsideration of the due process exploration of how students of varying culpability , participation and prior academic performance could receive the same punishments in the first instance . Finally , the " disclosure " that the brawl was " continuation " of conflict between " gang members " is implied in the court 's opinion as the weakest link in the school board 's defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's judgment that this is a cause worthy of his full commitment . <p> That question raised is the heart of the matter . The young men involved are as dissimilar in academic performance and personal reputation as any group of students could be . In fact , all that they all had in common was their race . And irrespective of race , Jackson and many others continue to hold the conviction that all of these youngsters and others like them are worthy of a fight for their life chances , and none is beyond redemption . <p> Rev. Marshall E. Hatch , <p> New Mount Pilgrim <p> Missionary Baptist Church , <p> West Garfield Park <p> Maker of the laws <p> Mayor Daley , the " brains " behind the Safe Neighborhoods Act ( a mom-and-apple-pie title makes it sell better ) , is great at pointing his finger at the Supreme Court or anyone else but himself for the current brouhaha over guns . <p> The blame for the failure of this legislation lies squarely on his shoulders . Because of his father , Daley was elected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Illinois Constitution . <p> The new Illinois Constitution and the former Illinois Constitution provide that all legislation must pertain to one topic only . This is to prevent laws being sneaked through the Legislature . <p> It is apparent that Daley never has read the very constitution that he signed . Perhaps he should refund the salary he received as a delegate . <p> Michael F. Manning , <p> West Ridge <p> Too close to home <p> Last Oct. 22 , the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee held a formal hearing about the pending transfer of the Panama Canal . The 1977 treaties are invalid because the United States and Panama approved different documents . According to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties , no treaty can be valid when portions of it are rejected by either of the parties . Originally , the Senate stipulated that our nation would have a unilateral right to intervene , even militarily , to keep the canal open . Panama 's version rejected this concept , and Panamanian leaders at the time announced their dissent . <p> This fiasco surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up such a strategic location ? Why does the Senate seem unconcerned about our national security ? We need a greater focus on national sovereignty instead of this pervasive , reckless globalism . <p> Frank B. Morsovillo , <p> Evergreen Park <p> Not a happy legacy <p> Your analogy between Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan ( editorial , Dec. 31 ) was sacrilegious . Put in proper perspective , the two names should not appear in the same paragraph . <p> Reagan 's " major tax reform , " far from providing the foundation for our current prosperity , just created a federal debt that is a millstone around the national economy . It also widened the gap between the rich and the poor . <p> You must have forgotten your Economics 101 ( or maybe you never took it ) , but you can easily and quickly bring yourself up to date by studying the recent PBS series of lectures on the subject . <p> Among other things , the series explains why President John F. Kennedy 's tax cut worked well and why Reagan 's did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you erroneously raised to a parallel with the Great Depression , was merely a short-lived aberration caused by a spike in energy costs . <p> By now we must realize that the Cold War was merely the worst of Reagan 's figments , and to put it on a level with the menace of Adolf Hitler 's Germany is a gross misreading of history . <p> Reagan 's indubitable appeal was to people who found it soothing to keep their heads under the sand , i.e. , to deny reality . <p> G.C. Lammers , Dixon <p> Parents not optional <p> I must commend Sharon Novickas ( Letters , Jan. 6 ) for a brilliant and succinct analysis of the problems of the Chicago public school system . <p> It is relatively easy to educate children who come from well-balanced families that can afford to , or choose to , send their children to private or Catholic schools . <p> However , when teachers have to spend so much of their time to maintain order and discipline in the classroom , with children who get no help at home from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very unfair to place all the blame on the teachers and their union . <p> Instead of promoting the use of vouchers , which will help a lucky few to escape from the system while making matters even worse for the remaining majority , we have to find a more practical solution . <p> Renato Barreto , Morgan Park <p> No nefarious motives <p> Dennis Byrne 's column ( " No Catholics allowed in House ? " Jan. 2 ) about the House chaplain selection was inaccurate . It said , " The Rev. Tim O'Brien , a professor who runs Marquette University 's Lee Aspin Center in Washington , D.C. , was the top candidate for the chaplain 's job on a list made up by a bipartisan selection committee . " That is wrong . The bipartisan selection committee sent forward three candidates , without preference , for consideration by House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert , Majority Leader Dick Armey ( R-Texas ) and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt ( D-Mo . ) . <p> When any Democrat contends that O'Brien was the committee 's first choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection committee narrowed its choices from six to three , each member was asked to select three candidates to be forwarded to the leaders . Selection committee members did n't rank the three , they simply checked off three names . <p> The candidate appearing most often on each list of three could have been each of the committee members ' third choice . There is simply no way to know , and for that reason it is inaccurate to assert that any one of the three finalists was " the top candidate " of the selection committee . When the leaders interviewed the three finalists , O'Brien 's largely academic background made him less suitable than the Rev. Charles Wright . <p> The disinformation being circulated about this process has led to confused reporting and editorializing about the subject . <p> Michele Davis , <p> communications director , <p> House Majority Leader Office , <p> Washington , D.C.
