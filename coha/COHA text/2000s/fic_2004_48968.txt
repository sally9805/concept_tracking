HIS HANDS DID N'T TREMBLE as he traced his daughter . She lay on the kitchen floor , pressing her back against the long , wide , white paper he 'd brought , her small movements translated into soft scratching sounds where the cut end tried to curl down into the floor . His pen moved along the horizons of her body - here , where her wrist widened , and then each finger ; down her side ; rounding the ball of her feet like the passage around the Cape of Good Hope ; up to where her wide shorts made it clear this was n't a work of pornography ; then back down the other leg and around . When he came to her spilling hair , he traced its silhouette rather than remain strictly against her skin . He wanted it to look like her , and Diane had thick , curly , gorgeous hair just like her mother had . <p> " Just almost done , sweetie , " he said when she started to shift and fidget . She quieted until the pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle closed . As he sat back , she jumped up to see . The shape was imperfect - the legs ended in awkward thalidomide bulbs , the hair obscured the long oval face , the lines of the tile were clear where the pen had jumped . <p> Still . <p> " Okay , " Ian said . " Now let 's just put this on here , and then .... " <p> " I want to write it , " Diane said . <p> Diane was eight , and penmanship was new to her and a thing of pride . Ian reached up to the table , took down a wooden ruler with a sharp metal edge , and drew lines for his daughter to follow . He handed her the pen and she hunched over . <p> " Okay , sweetie . Write this . Ready ? " <p> She nodded , her hair spilling into her face . She pushed it away impatiently , a gesture of her mother 's . Can dice , who pushed a lot of things away impatiently . <p> " Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow . " I 'm Flat Diane . My real girl , Diane Bursen , sent me out to travel for her . I ca n't write because I 'm only paper . Would you please send her a picture of us , so she can see where I am and what adventures " ( Ian stopped here to spell the word out ) " I 'm having ? " <p> Ian had to draw more lines on the other side of Flat Diane for the mailing address , but Diane waited and then filled that out too , only forgetting the zip code . <p> Together , they rolled Flat Diane thin and put her in a mailing tube , capped the end with a white plastic lid , and sealed it with tape . <p> " Can we send Flat Diane to see Mommy ? " <p> He could feel his reaction at the corners of his mouth . Diane 's face fell even before he spoke , her lower lip out , her brown eyes hard . Ian stroked her hair . <p> " We will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us know where we can mail things to her , we will . " <p> Diane jerked away , stomped off to the living room , and turned on the TV , sulking . Ian addressed the package to his mother in Scotland , since it seemed unlikely that either of them would be able to afford a transatlantic vacation anytime soon . When the evening news came on with its roster of rapes and killings , he turned off the set , escorted his protesting daughter through her evening rituals , tucked her into bed , and then went to his room and lay sleepless until after midnight . <p> The photograph shows his mother , smiling . Her face is broader than he remembered it , the hair a uniform gray but not yet white . She holds Flat Diane up , and behind them the half-remembered streets of Glasgow . <p> There is writing on the back in blue pen and a familiar hand : <p> Flat Diane arrived yesterday . I 'm taking her to my favorite teahouse this afternoon . It was designed by Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of Glasgow , and the scones are lovely . Tomorrow , we are going to work together . My love to Ian and the real Diane . <p> Mother Bursen <p> Diane was elated , and Ian was both pleased that the plan was working and saddened to realize how rare his daughter 's elation had become . She had insisted that the picture go with her to school , and while she promised that she would care for it , Ian was anxious for it . It was precious , irreplaceable , and therefore fragile . <p> After work , he went to collect her from her friend Kit 's house , anxiety for the picture still in the back of his mind . <p> " Today , " Kit 's father Tohiro reported as they drank their ritual cup of coffee , " everything was Scotland . How the people talk in Scotland . How the tea is made in Scotland . Whether you have to share tables at restaurants in Scotland . Diane has become the expert in everything . " <p> " It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw . She told us about the ... what ? The drawing ? Flat Diane ? It 's a good idea . " <p> " It gives her something to look forward to . And I wanted her to know how many people there are looking out for her . I have n't much family in the States . And with her mother gone .... " <p> A cascade of thumps announced the girls as they came down the stairs . Diane stalked into the kitchen , her brows furrowed , hair curled around her head like a storm cloud . She went to her father , arms extended in demand , and he lifted her familiar weight to his lap . <p> " I want to go home now , " she said . " Kit 's a butthead . " <p> Ian grimaced an apology . Tohiro smiled - amused , weary - and sipped his coffee . <p> " Okay , sweetie . Go get your coat , okay ? " <p> " I do n't want my coat . " <p> " Diane . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking over her shoulder once in anger at the betrayal of insisting on her coat , vanished again . Ian sighed . <p> " She 's just tired , " Tohiro said . " Kit 's the same way . " <p> They drove home through a rising fog . Though it made Ian nervous , driving when he could n't quite make out what was coming , Diane only chattered on , stringing together the events of her day with " and after and after and . " No matter if no two facts led one to another - they were what she had to say , and he listened half from weariness and half from love . <p> An accident of timers turned the lights on just as they pulled into the driveway , as if someone were there to greet them . There was nothing in the mailbox from Flat Diane . Or from Candice . <p> " Daddy ? " <p> Ian snapped to , as if coming awake . Diane held the screen door open , frowning at him impatiently . He could n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd fallen into dim reverie . <p> " Sorry , sweetie , " he said , pulling keys from his pocket . " Just got lost in the fog a minute . " <p> Diane turned , looking out at the risen gray . His daughter narrowed her eyes , looking out into nothing . <p> " I like the fog , " she said , delivering the pronouncement with the weight of law . " It smells like Scotland . " <p> And for a moment , it did . <p> THE PHOTOGRAPH is n't really a photograph but a color printout from an old printer , the ink shinier than the paper it stains . On it , Flat Diane is unfurled between a smiling couple . The man is thick , wide-lipped , graying at the temple . He wears a yellow polo shirt and makes a thumbs-up with the hand that is n't supporting Flat Diane . The woman is smaller , thinner . Her smile is pinched . She only looks like her brother Ian around the eyes and in the tilt of her nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light buttery yellow and somehow dirty . <p> The bottom of the page carries a message typed as part of the same document : <p> Dear Ian and Diane , <p> Flat Diane is here with us in Dallas . She 's just in time for Valentine 's Day . She 's coming out to our special dinner with us tonight at Carmine 's Bistro - Italian food . Yum ! <p> Hope everything 's good with you . see you soon . Much love . <p> Aunt Harriet and Uncle Bobby <p> In two weeks , Diane would be nine . It was a foreign thought . So little time seemed to have passed since her last birthday until he realized that Candice had n't quite left then . This , now , was his first birthday as both of her parents . He had demanded the day off , and his manager had acquiesced . He had arranged with the school to take her out for the day . A movie , a day with him , and a party that night with all her friends . Kit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He knew he was overcompensating . He hoped it would be enough , and not only for her . There was a loneliness in him that also had to be appeased . Over the course of months , the traces of his wife - still his wife , still only separated - had begun to erode . The last of her special toothpaste used up ; the pillows no longer smelling of her hair ; the foods that only she ate spoiled and thrown away . In their place were the toys Diane did n't put away , the homework left half-done on the table , the sugared breakfast cereals too sweet for Ian to enjoy except as candy . <p> But Diane 's things were all part his - hers to enjoy , and his to shepherd . Nothing had to be put away unless he said it did , nothing had to be finished unless he insisted , nothing was too sweet , too empty , too bad for you to be dinner except that Ian - big bad unreasonable mean Daddy - said no . Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . <p> It was Friday , and Kit was sleeping over . The girls were in the back in Diane 's room - playing video games . Ian sat on the couch with a beer sweating itself slick in his hand while a news magazine show told of a child drowned in the bathtub by his mother . The place smelled of order-out pizza and the perfume from the beauty salon toys that Kit brought over ; costume jewelry spread out on the carpet , glittering and abandoned . <p> Ian 's thoughts were pleasantly vague - the dim interest in the tragedy playing out on the television , the nagging knowledge that he would have to pretend to make the girls go to sleep soon ( they would stay up anyway ) , the usual pleasure of a week 's work ended . Kit 's shriek bolted ; him half across the house before his mind quite understood what the sound had been . <p> In the bedroom , the tableau . Kit sat inelegantly on the floor , her hand to her cheek , her nose bloody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic tentacles abandoned on the carpet ; the electric music still looping . And Diane , her hand still in a fist , but her eyes wide and horrified . <p> " What in Christ 's name is going on in here ? " Ian demanded . <p> " Sh ... she hit me , " Kit began , her voice rising as the tears began . " I did n't do anything and she just hit me . " <p> " Diane ? " <p> His daughter blinked and her gaze flickered at her friend , as if looking for support . And then her own eyes filled . <p> " It was my turn , " Diane said , defensively . <p> " So you hit her ? " <p> " I was mad . " <p> " I 'm going home ! " Kit howled , and bolted for the bathroom . Ian paused for a half second , then scowled and went after the girl , leaving Diane behind . Kit was in the bathroom , trying to stanch the blood with her hand . Ian helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped back , a wad of tissue pressed to her lip . The bleeding was n't bad , - it stopped quickly . There was no blood on the girl 's clothes . When he was sure it would n't start again , he wetted a washcloth and wiped Kit 's face gently , the blood pinking the terrycloth . <p> Diane haunted the doorway , her dark eyes profound with confusion and regret . <p> " I want to go home , " Kit said when he had finished . Her small mouth was pressed thin . Ian felt his heart bind . If Diane lost Kit , he 'd lose Tohiro and Anna . It was a fleeting thought , and he was ashamed of it the moment it struck him . <p> " Of course , " he said . " I 'll take you there . But first I think Diane owes you an apology . " <p> Diane was weeping openly , the tears gathering on her chin . Kit turned to her , and Ian crossed his arms . <p> " I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when people get mad , they hit each other sometimes . " <p> " Diane , what are you thinking ? Where did you get an idea like that ? " <p> " Uncle Bobby does , when he 's mad . He hits Aunt Harriet all the time . " <p> Ian felt his lips press thin . <p> " Really . And have you seen him hit her ? Diane , have you seen Bobby hit anyone , ever ? " <p> Diane frowned , thinking , trying to remember something . The failure emptied her . <p> " No . " <p> " Did anyone tell you a story about Bobby hitting Harriet ? " <p> Again the pause , and confusion deep as stone . <p> " No . " <p> " And ? " <p> Diane stared at him , her mouth half open , her eyes lost . <p> " I think the words we 're looking for are ' I 'm sorry , ' " Ian said . It was the way his father would have said it . <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... , " and Diane shook her head , held out her hands , palms up in a shrug that broke his heart . " I 'm sorry , Kitty . I wo n't do it again ever , I swear . Do n't go home , okay ? " <p> Kit , sullen , scowled at the white and blue tile at her feet . <p> " Please ? " Diane said . He could hear in the softness of her voice how much the word had cost . He paused , hoping that Kit would relent , that she would simply take the blow and accept it , that she would believe that Diane would never do it again . <p> ' " Kay , " Kit said . lan 's relief was palpable , and he saw it in Diane . His daughter ran over , grabbed her friend 's hand , pulled her out , back to the room . Ian looked in on them . Diane was showering Kit with affection , flattering her shamelessly , letting her play as many times as she cared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kit came back from the edge , and they were best friends again . <p> He put them both to bed , making them promise unconvincingly not to stay up talking , then went through the house , checking that the doors and windows were all locked , turning off the lights . He ended in the living room , in the overstuffed chair he 'd brought from his home when he and Candice first became lovers . The cushions knew the shape of his back . Sitting under a single lamp that was the only light in the house , he closed his eyes for a moment and drank in silence . The book he was reading a police procedural set in New Orleans - lay closed on his knee . His body was too tired to rest yet , his mind spun too fast by Diane and his isolation and the endless stretch of working at his desk . When he finally did open his book , the story of grotesque murder and alluring voodoo queens was a relief . <p> Diane walked in on bare feet just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls , and crawl into bed . She crossed the room , walking past the pool of light and receding for a moment into the darkness before coming back to him . In her hand was the scrapbook he 'd set aside for Flat Diane . Without speaking , she crawled onto his lap , opened the book with a creak of plastic and cheap glued spine , and took out the page they 'd just gotten . His sister , her husband . The meaty hand and sausage-thick thumb . His sister 's pinched smile . The filthy light . <p> " I do n't want this one in here , " Diane said , handing it to him . Her voice was small , frightened . " I do n't like Uncle Bobby . " <p> " Okay , sweetie , " he said , taking it from her . <p> She leaned against him now , her arms pressed into her chest , her knees drawn up . He put his arms around her and rocked gently until they were both near to sleep . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he understood what Flat Diane had become . <p> There are over a dozen photographs in the book now , but this latest addition commands its own page . In it , Candice is sitting at a simple wooden table . Her hair is pulled back in a ponytail that even where it is bound is thick as her forearm . Her eyes slant down at the corners , but her skin is the same tone as Diane 's , the oval face clearly the product of the same blood . There is a spider plant hanging above her . The impression is of melancholy and calm and tremendous intimacy . It is not clear who operated the camera . <p> Flat Diane is in the chair beside her , folded as if she were sitting with her mother . A small , cartoon heart has been added to the paper , though it is not clear by whom . <p> The real Diane has outstripped her shadow - taller , thinner , more awkward about the knees and elbows . This silhouette is already the artifact of a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the picture . In the scrapbook , the only sign of change is a bend on one corner of Flat Diane 's wide paper , a design drawn in the white space over the outlined left shoulder , and the lock of white hair across Candice 's forehead . <p> The letter reads : <p> Diane <p> Flat Diane arrived yesterday . I have to tell you she makes me miss you . You can see she 's here with me in my apartment . <p> I love you very much , Diane . I know that it ca n't seem like it right now , but please believe me when I say it 's true . There is no one in the world more important to me than you are . And I hope that , when your father and I have worked out the paths our souls need to take , we can be together again . Whatever happens , I will always be your mother . <p> It is signed Candice Calvino , her maiden name . <p> The other letter is not in the scrapbook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really do n't know what to say . I thought that I could just sit down and write this to you rationally , but I am just so goddamn pissed off , I 'm not sure that 's possible . <p> This stunt is exactly the kind of emotional extortion that made it impossible for me to stay near you . What were you thinking ? That you could hold her up , maybe wave her around like a flag , and make me come trotting back - we could just stay together for the children 's sake ? Our daughter should be more than just the easiest tool for you to get in a dig at me . How could you do this to her ? <p> If you wanted to make me feel guilty or shamed or selfish , well nice job , Ian . You did . <p> Never use her like this again . If it is n't beneath you , it goddamn well should be . <p> C. <p> The hallway outside the school 's administrative offices had white stucco walls , linoleum flooring worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent lighting . An old clock - white face yellow with age - reported twenty minutes before the noon bell would ring , the press of small bodies filling the halls like spring tadpoles . When Ian walked in , straightening his tie , swallowing his dread , his footsteps echoed . <p> The secretary smiled professionally when he gave her his name , and led him to a smaller room in the back . The placard on the door - white letters on false wood grain - said that the principal 's name was Claude Bruchelli . The secretary knocked once , opened the door , and stepped aside to let Ian pass through a cloud of her cloying perfume and into the office . <p> The principal rose , stretching out a hand , establishing for Diane that the grownups were together , that they had special rules of respect and courtesy . It was the sort of thing Ian remembered with resentment from when he 'd been her age , but he shook the man 's hand all the same . <p> " Thanks for coming , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work like this . But we have a problem . " <p> Diane , sitting on a hard-backed chair , stared at her feet . The way she drummed her heels lightly against the chair legs told him that this was not resentment , but remorse . Ian cleared his throat . <p> " All right , " he said . " What 's she done ? " <p> " Mr. Bursen , we have some very strict guidelines from the city about fighting . " <p> " Another fight ? " <p> The principal nodded gravely . It had been at morning recess . Her friend Kit had been adamant that the other girl had started it , but the teacher who had seen it all reported otherwise . No , there had been no injuries beyond a few scratches . This was , however , the third time , which meant a mandatory three-day suspension . <p> Diane , stone-faced , seemed to be staring at a banner on the wall that blared WE AIM FOR EXCELLENCE ! WE EXPECT THE BEST OF You ! <p> " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homework for her and she can do it at home . " <p> The principal nodded , but did n't speak . He looked at Ian from under furrowed brows . <p> " Mr. Bursen , I have to follow the guidelines . And they 're good as far as they go , but Diane 's anger problems are n't going to go away . I wish you 'd reconsider letting Mrs. Birch .... " <p> " No . I 'm sorry , no . I 've had a certain amount of counseling myself , one time and another . It does n't do any good to force a child into it . " <p> " Perhaps Diane would choose to , " the principal said , as if she was n't there , as if her dark , hard eyes were n't fixed on his wall . Ian shrugged . <p> " Well , what of it , Diane ? Care to see Mrs. Birch ? " He 'd meant to say it gently , but the tone when it left his mouth sounded more of sarcasm . Diane shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All the way back home , Diane pressed herself against the car door , keeping as far from Ian as she could . He did n't try to speak , not until he knew which words were in him . Instead , he ran through all the people he could think of who might be able or willing to look after Diane for the duration of her exile . <p> When , that night , he finally spoke , he did it poorly . They were eating dinner - chicken soup and peanut butter sandwiches . He had n't spoken , she had sulked . Between them the house had been a bent twig , tension ready to snap . <p> " I ca n't afford to take three days off work , " he said . " They 'll fire me . " <p> Diane shrugged , a movement she inherited from him . Her father , who shrugged a lot of feelings away . <p> " Di , can you at least tell me what this is all about ? Fighting at school . It is n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She called me a nerd . " <p> " And so you hit her ? " <p> Diane nodded and took a bite of her sandwich . Ian felt the blood rushing into his face . <p> " Jesus Christ , Di . You ca n't do this ! What . .. I do n't know what you 're thinking ! I am holding on to this house by a thread . I am working every day for you , and you are being a little brat ! I do n't deserve this from you , you know that ? " <p> The bowl sailed across the room , soup arcing out behind it . It shattered where it landed . Diane 's bowl . Ian went silent . She stood on her chair , making small grunting noises as she tore the sandwich and squeezed the bread and peanut butter into paste . <p> " You never listen to me ! You always take everyone else 's side ! " <p> " Diane .... " <p> " When ? " she screamed . " Exactly when in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her mother 's voice , her mother 's tone and vocabulary . lan 's chest ached suddenly , and the thought came unbidden : What has Candice said in front of that drawing ? Diane turned and bolted from the room . <p> When the shards of their dinner were disposed of , the salt of soup and sweet of sandwich buried alike in the disposal , Ian went to her . In the dark of her room , Diane was curled on her bed . He sat beside her and stroked her hair . <p> " I did n't do anything wrong , " she said , her voice thick with tears . She did n't mean fighting or throwing soup bowls . She meant that she had done nothing to deserve her mother 's absence . <p> " I know , sweetie . I know you did n't . " <p> " I want to see Mrs. Birch . " <p> He felt his hand falter , forced it to keep touching her , keep reassuring her that he was there , that they were a family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , sweetie , " he said . " We can do that if you want . " <p> He felt her nod . That night , trying to sleep , he thought of every mean-spirited thing he 'd ever said to Diane , of every slight and disappointment and failure that he 'd added to her burden . Candice 's letter - the private one she 'd sent to him - rang in his mind . Diane would be confessing all his sins to someone he 'd never met , who would be taking confidences from his daughter that he might never know . , <p> For all the weeks and months that he 'd silently prayed for someone to help , someone to shoulder part of the burden of Diane 's soul , the granting tasted bitter . His fears were unfounded . <p> The time came , and Mrs. Birch - a thick woman with a pocked face and gentle voice - became a character in Diane 's tales of her days . He waited with a sense of dread , but no recriminations came back to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and a father . In fact , over the weeks , Diane seemed to become more herself . The routine of fight and reconciliation with Kit , the occasional missive from Flat Diane 's latest hosts , the complaints about schoolwork and clothes and how little money he had to spend on her all came almost back to normal . Once , he saw what might have been anger when Diane saw a photograph of her mother . After that he noticed that she had stopped asking when Mommy was coming home . He could n't have said , if asked , whether the sorrow , the sense of triumph , or the guilt over that sense was the strongest of his reactions . <p> Everything was fine until the night in February when she woke up screaming and did n't stop . <p> THE PICTURE is cheap - the color balance is off , giving the man 's face an unnatural yellow tint . He is in his later twenties , perhaps his early thirties , the presentiment of jowls already plucking the flesh of his jaws . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the picture , Flat Diane has been taped around a wide pillar , her arms and legs bending back out of sight . A long black cloth wraps across where the eyes might be , had Ian drawn them in ; a blindfold . <p> The man who Ian does n't know , has never met , is caressing a drawn-in breast . His tongue protrudes from his viciously grinning mouth , its tip flickering distance from the silhouette 's thigh . He looks not like Satan , but like someone who wishes that he were , someone trying very hard to be . <p> The writing on the back of the photograph is block letters , written in blue felt-tip . <p> It reads : FLAT DIANE HAS GONE ASTRAY . <p> A new photograph comes every week . Some might be amusing to another person ; most make him want to retch . <p> The best trick Hell has to play against its inmates is to whisper to them that this - this now - is the bottom . Nothing can be worse than this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , " Ian said , refusing to understand . " I did n't catch that . " <p> Mrs. Birch leaned back , her wide , pitted face tired and impassive . She laced her hands on her desk . The hiss of the heating system was the only sound while she brought herself to break the news again . This time , she took a less direct approach . <p> " Diane has always had an anger problem . There 's no good time to lose your mother , but this stage of development is particularly bad . And I think that accounts for a lot of her long-term behaviors . The fighting , the acting out in class , but these new issues .... " <p> " Child Protective Services ? " Ian said , able at last to repeat the counselor 's statement and plumb the next depth of hell . " You called Child Protective Services ? " <p> " The kind of sudden change we 've seen in her - the nightmares , the anxiety attacks .... She 's in fifth grade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having anxiety attacks . When she went to the doctor , you and he and two nurses together could n't get her to undress , and you say she never had a problem with it before . That kind of sudden change means trauma . Nothing does that but trauma . " <p> Ian closed his eyes , the heel of his palm pressed to his brow , rubbing deeply . His body shook , but it seemed unconnected to his terrible clarity of mind , as if the tremors were something being done to him . <p> " The Buspar seems to be helping , " he said . An idiot change of subject , and not at all to the point , but Mrs. Birch shifted in her chair and went there with him . <p> " There are a lot of anti-anxiety drugs , " she agreed . " Some of them may help . But only with the symptoms , not the problem . And the trauma , whatever it is ... it may be something ongoing . " <p> " Christ . " <p> " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's middle school , and I wo n't be able to see her anymore . With CPS , you 'll have a caseworker , someone who is n't going to change every time she switches schools . And who knows ? Maybe the investigation will help . I 'm sorry . About all of this . I really am . But it 's the right thing . " <p> Now it was lan 's turn to go silent , to gather himself . Speaking the words was like standing at the edge of a cliff . <p> " You think I 'm fucking my kid . " <p> " No , " Mrs. Birch said , in the voice of a woman for whom this territory was not new . " But I think somebody is . " <p> Diane waited for him in the outer office , looking smaller than she was , folded in on herself . He forced himself to look at her as she was , and not as he wanted her to be . She forced a smile and raised a hand , sarcastic and sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Diane would not meet his gaze . Mrs. Birch was a presence he felt behind him , but did n't see . <p> " Sweetie , " he said . <p> Diane did n't look up . He reached out to stroke her hair , but hesitated , pulled back . It was that fear that touching his child would be interpreted as sex that brought home how much they had lost . <p> " It 's going to be okay , sweetie , " he said , and Diane nodded , though she did n't believe it . When he stood , she scooped up her book bag and went out with him . In the hallway , with Mrs. Birch still haunting the door to the office , Diane reached up and put her hand in his . It was a thin victory , hardly any comfort at all . <p> The clouds were close , smelling of rain . He drove home slowly , the sense of disconnection , of unreality , growing as the familiar streets passed by . Diane sat alert but silent until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make me live with Mom ? " <p> A pang of fear so sharp it was hard to differentiate from nausea struck him , but he kept his voice calm . He could n't let her think they might lose each other . <p> " Make you ? No , sweet . There 's going to be someone from the state who 's going to want to talk to you , but that 's all . " <p> " Okay . " <p> " They 're going to ask you questions , " he continued , the words leaking from him like air from a pricked balloon . " You just need to tell them the truth . Even if you get embarrassed or someone told you that you should n't tell them something , you should tell them the truth . " <p> " Okay . " <p> He pulled into the driveway , their house - Christ , the mortgage payment was a week late already ; he had to remember to mail the check tomorrow - looming in the twilight . The lawn was the spare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the truth too , " he said , amazed by how sane he sounded , how reasonable . " Sweetie ? Is there anyone who 's doing things to you ? Things you do n't like ? " <p> " Like am I getting molested ? " <p> Amazing too how old she had become . He killed the engine . There had to be some way to ask gently , some approach to this where he could still treat her like a child , still protect her innocence . He did n't know it , could n't find it . The rich scent of spring was an insult . <p> " Are you ? " he asked . <p> Diane 's eyes focused on the middle distance , her face a mask of concentration . Slowly , she shook her head , but her hands plucked at the seat , popping the cloth upholstery in wordless distress . <p> " If something were happening , Di , you could tell me . There would n't be anything to be afraid of . " <p> " It 's not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's at night . It 's like I know things .. . there 's things I know and things I can almost remember . But they did n't happen . " <p> " You 're sure they did n't ? " <p> A hesitation , but a nod - firm and certain . <p> " The doctor 's going to want to examine you , " he said . <p> " I do n't want him to . " <p> " Would it be better with a different doctor ? " <p> " No . " <p> " What if it was a woman ? Would that make it easier ? " <p> Diane frowned out the window of the car . <p> " Maybe , " she said softly . Then , " I do n't want to be crazy . " <p> " You 're not , sweet . You 're not crazy . No more than I am . " <p> They ate dinner together , talking about other things , laughing even . A thin varnish of normalcy that Ian felt his daughter clinging to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Diane retreated to gossip in privacy while Ian cleaned the dishes . He read her to sleep , watching her chest from the corner of his eye until her breath was steady and deep and calm . He left a night-light glowing , a habit she 'd returned to recently . <p> He sat in the kitchen and slowly , his hands shaking , laid out the pictures of Flat Diane - the ones recently arrived , the ones he had n't shown her . He shuffled them , rearranged them , spread them out like tarot . <p> It had been stupid , sending out their real address . Ian saw that now , and twisted the thought to better feel the pain of it . What if this mad fucker had tracked down Diane because Ian had as good as sent out directions to her ... ? <p> But no , he did n't believe that . Or that Tohiro or one of her teachers or some evil pizza delivery man had targeted her . The photographs were too much a coincidence , the timing too precise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university , back at home in Scotland . The old man had told each of them to bring in a picture of a person they loved - mother , father , brother , lover , pet . And then , he 'd told them to gouge out the eyes . The shocked silence was the first moment of his lecture on the power of image , the power of art . These were dumb bits of paper , but each of them that touched pen-tip to a beloved eye knew - did not believe , but knew- that the pictures were connected with the people they represented . <p> Ian had sent his daughter 's soul voyaging . He had n't even considered the risks . It was worse than sending only their address ; he might as well have delivered her , trussed and helpless . And now .... <p> And now Flat Diane had gone astray . <p> With a boning knife , he cut out the blond man 's blue eyes , but he felt the effort 's emptiness . Nothing so poetic for him . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his computer , and scanned in the bastard 's face . When it was saved , he dropped it into e-mail and then got on the phone . <p> " Hello ? " Candice said from a thousand miles away . Her voice was uncertain - wondering , he supposed , who would be calling her so late at night . <p> " It 's Ian . Check your e-mail . " <p> The pause would have been strained if he 'd cared more . If this had still been about the two of them and what they had and lost and why . Only it was n't , and the hesitation at the far end of the line only made him impatient . <p> " Ian , what 's this about ? " <p> " Flat Diane , actually . I 've had a letter for her . Several . I need to know who the man is in the pictures . " <p> Another pause , but this one different . Ian could hear it in the way she breathed . Intimacy can lead to this , he supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath on the far end of a phone line . <p> " You already know , " he said . " Do n't you . " <p> " My computer 's in another room . I can call you back . " <p> " I 'll wait , " he said . <p> She was back within five minutes , the hard plastic fumbling as she picked the handset back up , giving way to her voice . <p> " I 'm sorry , Ian , " she said . " This is my fault . His name is Stan Lecky . He ... he was a neighbor of mine when I came out here . A friend . " <p> " A lover ? " <p> " No , Ian . Just a friend . But .. . he started saying things that made me .... We had a falling out . I got a restraining order . He moved away eight or nine months ago . " <p> " He was the one who took the picture of you , was n't he ? The picture of you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ian considered the envelope that had contained the latest atrocity . The postmark was from Seattle . Stan Lecky in Seattle . And a photo of him , no less . Certainly it could n't be so hard with all that to find an address . <p> " She has n't seen that , has she ? " Candice asked . He did n't know how best to answer . <p> Ian slept in on Saturday , pretending that the dead black sleep and the hung-over exhaustion of his body were related somehow to luxury . It had been years since he 'd been able to sleep past six A.M. He had Diane to feed and dress and shuffle off to school . He had his commute . His body learned its rhythms , and then it held to them . But Saturday , Ian rose at ten . <p> Diane was already on the couch , a bowl of cereal in her lap , her eyes clouded . Her skin seemed paler , framed by the darkness of her hair . Bags under her eyes like bruises . Ian recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or perhaps to hold a bit of the soul that had fled . He made himself toast and tea , and sat beside his daughter . <p> On the TV , girls three or four years older than Diane were talking animatedly about their boyfriends . They wore tight jeans and midriff tops , and no one thought it odd . No one wondered whether this was the path of wisdom . He found himself wondering what Diane made of it , but did n't ask . There were more pressing issues . <p> " How 'd you sleep ? " he asked . <p> " Okay . " <p> " More nightmares ? " <p> She shrugged , her gaze fixed on the screen . Ian nodded , accepting the tacit yes . He finished his toast , washed down the last of his tea , smacked his lips . <p> " I have to go out for a little while . Errands . " <p> " Want me to come too ? " <p> " No , you stay here . I wo n't be long . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ache to see it . Part of that was knowing that he 'd once again failed to protect her from some pain , and part a presentiment of the longer absence she would have to endure . He leaned over and kissed the crown of her head where the bones had n't been closed the first time he 'd held her . <p> " I 'll be right back , kiddo , " he murmured , and she smiled wanly , accepting his half-apology . And yet , by the time he had his keys , she was lost again in the television , gone into her own world as if he had never been there . <p> Tohiro was sitting in his driveway , a lawnmower partially disassembled before him . He nodded as Ian came up the path , but neither rose nor turned back to his work . Ian squatted beside him . <p> " I do n't know why I think I can do this , " Tohiro said . " Every time I start , it 's like I do n't remember how poorly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back to me , it 's too late , the thing 's already in pieces . " <p> " Hard . I do the same thing myself . " <p> Tohiro nodded . <p> " I need a favor , " Ian said . " I have to go away for a bit . Diane 's mother and I ... there are some things weneedto discuss . I might be away for week , perhaps . Perhaps less . I was wondering if .... " <p> It choked him . Asking for help had never been a strong suit , nor lying . The two together were almost more than he could manage . Tohiro frowned and leaned forward , picking up a small , grease-covered bit of machinery and dropping it thoughtfully into a can of gasoline . <p> " Are you sure that 's wise ? " Tohiro asked . " The timing might look .... " <p> He knew then . Diane had told Kit , and Kit her parents ; nothing could be more natural . <p> " I do n't have the option , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening to Diane ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> lan 's knees were starting to ache a bit , but he did n't move , nor did Tohiro . The moment stretched , then : <p> " It might be better if Kit invited her , " Tohiro said . " If it were a treat - a week-long slumber party - it could mask the sting . " <p> " Do you think she would ? " <p> " For Diane ? Kit would learn to fly if Diane asked her , Girls . " <p> " I 'd appreciate it . More than I can say . " <p> " You are putting a certain faith in me . " <p> Tohiro met his gaze , expression almost challenging . <p> " It is n't you , " Ian said , softly . " I 'm fairly sure I know who it is . " <p> " I see . " <p> Ian shrugged , aware as he did so that it was a mirror of his daughter 's , and that Tohiro would understand its eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let you know when it 's going to happen , " Ian said . " I ca n't go before the CPS home visit , but it wo n't be long after that . And if you ever need the same of me , only say so . " <p> The man shifted under lan 's words , uneased . Dark eyes looked up at him and then away . Tohiro stuck fingers into the gasoline , pulling out the shining metal that the fuel had cleaned . <p> " That brings up something . Ian .... Anna and I would rather not have Kit stay over with Diane . I know it is n't you , that you would n't .. . but the stakes are high , and I ca n't afford being wrong . " <p> Ian rocked back . A too-wide rictus grin forced its way onto his face he could feel the skin pulling . <p> " I 'm sorry , Ian , it 's just .... " <p> " It 's the right thing , " he forced out , ignoring the anger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute that it was you ... or even if I only were n't certain , then .... " <p> Ian opened his hands , fingers spread ; the gesture a suggestion of open possibility , a euphemism for violence . It was something they both understood . Men protected their children . Men like the two of them , at least . <p> Ian pulled himself up , his knees creaking . Kit , in the window , caught sight of him and waved . She was lighter than Diane , but not as pretty , Ian thought . <p> " I 'll call later , " Ian said . <p> " Do . I 'll talk with Kit . We 'll arrange things . But Ian ? Diane needs you . " <p> " I know she does . I do n't want to leave her . Especially now , I just .... " <p> " I did n't mean do n't go , " Tohiro said . " I meant do n't get caught . " <p> The home visit was less than he expected . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One took Diane away , the other asked him profoundly personal questions - Why had his wife left him ? Had he been in therapy ? Did he have a police record ? Could he describe his relationship with his daughter ? Only the last of these pushed him to tears . The woman was sympathetic , but unmoved ; a citizen of a nation of tears from innocent and guilty alike . <p> She arranged a time and place for Diane to see a doctor - a woman doctor and Ian had n't even had to ask . He promised that Diane would be there , and she explained the legal ramifications if she were not . The other woman appeared with Diane at her side . Diane 's face was gray with exhaustion . Ian shook their hands , thanked them explicitly for coming , implicitly for not taking his child from him . <p> When they had gone , Diane went out to the back steps , looking out over a yard gone to seed - long grass and weeds . Her head rested in her hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was it ? " he asked . <p> " She asked me a lot of questions , " Diane said . " I do n't know if I answered them all right . " <p> " Did you tell her the truth ? " <p> " I think so . " <p> " Only think ? " <p> Diane 's brow furrowed as she looked at the horizon . Her shoulders hunched forward . <p> " She asks if things happened . And sometimes I think they did , but then I ca n't remember . After a while I start getting scared . " <p> " It 's like you 're living a life you do n't know about , " Ian said , and she nodded . He put an arm around her shoulders , and she leaned in to him , trembling and starting to cry . Her sobs wracked her thin body like vomiting . Ian , holding her , wept . <p> " I 'm not okay , Daddy , " she wailed to his breast . " I 'm not okay . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetie . You will . " <p> " THE PICTURE is cropped . In the original , things had been happening as unnatural to paper as they would be to a child . In this version , only the man 's chest above the nipples , his shoulders , his face , his smug expression . These are all the details that matter . In this photograph , he could be anyone , doing anything . It is a head shot , something to put down on a bar or store counter , the sort of photograph that seems to fit perfectly with the phrase " I 'm looking for someone , maybe you 've seen him . " <p> The original photo has obscenities and suggestions written on it . There is no writing on this copy , no note to accompany it . Nothing that will tie it back to Ian , should the police find it and not him . <p> He had driven to Seattle - a two-day trip - in a day and a half . Flying would have been faster , but he 'd taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy ; flying impossible or , if not impossible , not worth doing . <p> He arrived in the city late at night and called Diane from a payphone using a card he 'd bought with cash . She was fine . School was boring . Kit was a butthead . Her voice was almost normal - if he knew her less , he might have mistaken it . He was her father , though , and he knew what she sounded like when things were okay and when she only wanted them to be . They did n't talk about the nightmares . He told her he loved her , and she evaded , embarrassed . With the handset back in its cradle , the gun in his jacket pocket pulling the fabric down like a hand on his shoulder , Ian stood in the rain , the cool near-mist soaking him . In time , he gathered himself together enough to find a hotel and a bed to lie in while his flesh hummed from exhaustion and the road . <p> Finding Lecky took all the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The morning sun gave the lie to the city 's gray reputation - clouds of perfect white stretched , thinned , vanished , re-forrned against a perfect blue sky . Nature ignoring lan 's desperation . The kids spare changing on the street corners avoided his gaze . <p> It was early , the morning rush hour still a half hour from starting . Ian did n't want the beast to go off to work , did n't want to spend a day waiting for the confrontation . He wanted it over now . <p> The house was in a bad part of town , but the lawn was trim , the windows clean . Moss stained the concrete walk , and the morning paper lay on the step , wrapped in dewy plastic . Ian picked it up , shaking the drops from it , and then rang the doorbell . His breath was shaking . The door opened and the beast appeared , a cup of coffee in one hand . <p> There was no glimmer of recognition , no particular sense of confusion or unease . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . A man who had done no wrong . <p> " I need to talk to you , " Ian said , handing the man his newspaper . <p> " I 'm sorry . Do I know you ? " <p> " No . But we have business in common . We have people in common , I think . May I come in ? " <p> The man frowned at Ian and put down the paper . <p> " I 'm sorry , " the beast said , smiling as he stepped back , preparing to close the door . " I have to get to work here , and really I do n't want whatever you 're selling . Thanks , though . " <p> " I 've come for Flat Diane . " <p> The man 's expression shifted - surprise , chagrin , anger , all in the course of a single breath . Ian clamped his hand on the butt of his pistol , his finger resting against the trigger . <p> " Do n't pretend you do n't know what I 'm talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The beast shook his head , defensive and dismissive at the same time . <p> " Okay , " the man said . " Okay , look , so it was a bad joke . All right . I mean , it 's not like anyone got hurt , right ? " <p> " What do you know about it ? " <p> Something in lan 's voice caught his attention . Pale blue eyes fixed on him , the first hint of fear behind them . Ian did n't soften . His heart was tripping over as if he 'd been running , but his head felt very calm . <p> " No one got hurt , " the man said . " It 's just paper . So maybe it was a little crude . It was just a joke , right ? You 're , like , Diane 's dad ? Look , I 'm sorry if that was a little upsetting , but .... " <p> " I saw what you did to her . " <p> " To who ? " The eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My daughter . " <p> " I never touched your daughter . " <p> " No ? " <p> It was a joy , stripping his certainty away , seeing the smug , leering face confused and frightened . Ian leaned in . <p> " Tell you what . Give me Flat Diane , " he said , " and I might let you live . " <p> The panic in the pale eyes was joyous , but even in his victory , Ian felt the hint that it was too much ; he 'd gone too far . <p> " Sure , " the beast said , nodding . " No , really , sure . Come on , I 'll .... " <p> And he tried to slam the door . Ian had known it was coming , was ready for it . His foot blocked the closing door and he pulled the gun from his pocket . The beast jumped back , lost his balance , toppled . The coffee fanned out behind him and splashed on the hardwood floor as Ian kicked the door closed behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were raised , not in surrender , but protection , as if his fingers might deflect a bullet . A radio was playing - morning show chatter . Ian smelled bacon grease on the air . <p> " Please , " the beast said . " Look , it 's going to be okay , guy . Just no guns . All right ? No guns . " <p> " Where is she ? " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Flat Diane ! " Ian yelled , pleased to see the beast flinch . <p> " It 's not here anymore . Seriously . Seriously , it 's gone . Joke over . Honestly . " <p> " I do n't believe you . " <p> " Look , it 's a long story . There were some things that happened and it just made sense to get rid of it , you know ? Let it go . It was only supposed to be a joke . You know Candice .... " <p> Ian shook his head . He felt strange ; his mind was thick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leaving without her , " he said . <p> " It 's not here ! " the beast shouted , his face flushed red . He rolled over , suddenly facing the back of the house . Running . With a feeling like reaching out to tap the fleeing man 's shoulder , Ian raised the gun and fired . The back of the beast 's head bloomed like a rose , and he fell . <p> Oh Jesus , Ian thought . And then , a moment later , I could n't have made that shot if I 'd tried . <p> He walked forward , pistol trained on the unmoving shape , but there was no need . The beast was dead . He 'd killed him . Ian stood silently , watching the pool of blood seep across the floor . There was less than he 'd thought . The morning show announcers laughed at something . Outside , a semi drove by , rattling the windows . Ian put the gun in his pocket , ignoring the heat . <p> He had n't touched anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did n't have Flat Diane . He had to search the place . He had to hurry . Perhaps the beast kept plastic gloves . The kind you use for housework . <p> He searched the bedroom , the bath . The kitchen where half an egg was growing cold and solid on its plate . And then the room in the back . The room from the pictures . He went through everything - the stacks of pornography , the camera equipment . He did n't look away , no matter how vile the things he found . Rape porn . Children being used . Other things . Worse . But not his daughter . <p> He sat on the edge of the bathtub , head in his hands , when the voice came . The house was a shambles . Flat Diane was n't there , or if she was , she was too well hidden . He did n't know what to do . The doorbell chimed innocently and a faint voice came . <p> " Stan ? " it said . A woman 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Margie . " <p> Ian stood and walked . He did n't run . He stepped over the corpse , calmly out the back door , stuffing the rubber gloves into his pockets as he went . There was an alleyway , and he opened the gate and stepped out into it . He did n't run . If he ran , they 'd know he was running from something . And Diane needed him , did n't she . Needed him not to get caught . <p> Ian did n't stop to retrieve his things from the hotel ; he walked to his car , slipped behind the wheel , drove . Twenty minutes east of Klamath Falls , he pulled to the side , walked to a tree , and leaning against it , vomited until he wept . <p> " I did n't mean to , " he said through his horror . " Christ , I did n't mean to . " <p> He had n't called Diane from his room . He had n't given anyone his name . He 'd even found a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . <p> " I did n't mean to , " he said . <p> He slept that night at a rest stop , bent uncomfortably across the back seat . In his dreams , he saw the moment again and again ; felt the pistol jump ; heard the body strike wood . The pistol jumped ; the body struck the floor . The pale head , round as an egg , cracked open . The man fled , heels kicking back behind him ; the pistol jumped . <p> Morning was sick . A pale sun in an empty sky . Ian stretched out the vicious kinks in his back , washed his face in the restroom sink , and drove until nightfall . <p> He had n't found Flat Diane , but he could n't go back for her - not now . Maybe later , when things cooled down . But by then she could have been thrown away or burned or cut to pieces . And he could n't guess what might happen to Diane when her shadow was destroyed - freedom or death or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The worst was over , though . The worst had to be over , or else he did n't think he could keep breathing . <p> Tohiro and Anna 's house glowed in the twilight , windows bright and cheerful and warm and normal . He watched them from the street , his back knotted from driving , the car ticking as it cooled . Tohiro passed by the picture window , his expression calm , distant and slightly amused . Anna was in the kitchen , the back of her head moving as her hands worked at something ; washing , cutting , wringing - there was no way to tell . Somewhere in there , Kit and Diane played the games they always did . The pistol jumped ; the body fell . Ian started the car , steadied his hands on the wheel , then killed the engine and got out . <p> Tohiro 's eyebrows rose a fraction and a half-smile graced his mouth when he opened the door . <p> " Welcome back , " Tohiro said , stepping back to let him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things went better than you thought ? " <p> " Things went faster . " <p> Curiosity plucked at the corners of Tohiro 's eyes . Ian gazed into the house , willing away the questions that begged to be asked . Tohiro closed the door . <p> " You look ... , " he began . <p> Ian waited . Like shit . Or maybe pounded . The silence stretched and he glanced over . Tohiro 's face was a soft melancholy . Ian nodded , barely moving , half asking him to finish , half daring him . <p> " You look older . " <p> " Yeah , well . You know . Time . " <p> A shriek and the drumming of bare feet and Diane had leapt into his arms . His spine protested the weight . Ian held her carefully , like something precious . Then , as if she 'd suddenly remembered that they were n't alone , she drew back , tried to make it all seem casual . <p> " Hey , " she said . <p> " Hey . You been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture . <p> " We were just about to have supper , " Tohiro said . " If you 'd like to join us ? " <p> Ian looked at Diane . Her face was impassive , blank , but at the edges there were the touches invisible to anyone else , anyone who did n't know her as he did . <p> " I think I 'd rather just roll on home , " Ian said . " That good by you , sweetie ? " <p> " Sure , " she said , upbeat enough that he knew it had been her fondest wish . He let her ride him to the car , piggyback . <p> That night , they both suffered nightmares . It struck Ian , as he calmed Diane from hers and waited for his own to fade , that there would be more nights like this ; screams from her or from him , then warm milk and nightlights and empty talk that gave the evil some time to fade . That if they were lucky there would be many more . Nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call for him . It was the best he could hope for . <p> " It 's okay , " he whispered to her as she began to drowse . Curled into her blanket , her breath came deeper , more regular . " It 's over . It 's over , sweetie . It 's all right . " <p> He did n't add that just being over did n't mean it had n't changed everything forever , or that some things do n't stop just because they 've ended . Or that a girl set voyaging takes her own chances , and no father 's love - however profound - can ever call her back . Those were n't the sorts of things you said when all you had to offer your child were comfort and hope . <p> Sidebar
