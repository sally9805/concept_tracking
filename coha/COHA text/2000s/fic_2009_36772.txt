The mirror had to be warped . That was the only explanation for the image staring back at Allie from its treacherous surface . Her thighs could n't be that wide , her belly that flabby . Could glass warp ? Of course not . But the weather so far this fall had been wetter than normal , following a horribly humid Kentucky summer . All that dampness wreaked havoc on the wooden front door at Gram 's house . And this mirror had a wood frame . That had to be it . <p> But the warping seemed only to be in the middle , like one of those fun-house mirrors . She squinted down at her pink toenails . Her feet looked normal . Her face looked okay . Pretty good , even . This was the first time she 'd put on makeup in weeks , and a little color worked wonders . She could use a haircut , though the dark blonde layers falling in waves to rest on her shoulders managed to hold the extra length well . <p> She blew her bangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her face look fuller , and that offset some of the width of her hips . Which needed the help , especially now that she got a good look at them wearing only a nursing bra and panties . If she cut some of the volume out of her hair , she 'd look like one of those toys she and Joan and Tori played with as kids . What were they called ? Weebles . She 'd look like Mother Weeble . <p> She swayed from side to side , eyeing her oversized bottom half as she sang the toy 's jingle . " Weebles wobble but they do n't fall down . " <p> " Did you say something ? " <p> Allie whirled to find Eric standing in the bedroom doorway , a grin twitching at his mouth . She felt a blush creep up her neck . Though he was the world 's most awesome husband and devoted new daddy , she still felt awkward parading her postmaternity body around in front of him . A flabby belly covered in stretch marks was soooo sexy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> His voice dropped an octave as his smile deepened . " Long enough to admire my beautiful wife . " <p> No mistaking that husky tone . She snatched her jeans off the bed . " Do n't get frisky , lover boy . My sister will be here any minute . " <p> Eric 's lips twisted . " Story of my life lately . " <p> Allie crossed the room and placed a tender kiss on his cheek . " I 'm sorry my family is here so often . They just do n't want to miss a day with the baby . She 's growing so fast . " <p> " I know , I know . " He grinned . " But tonight I get Joanie all to myself . Our first father-daughter date . " <p> Allie sat on the edge of the bed and slipped her feet into the jeans , avoiding Eric 's eyes . He had been looking forward to this evening for a full week , ever since Joan invited her to go to a stupid party where some fanatical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want and for which she had no use . If only Joan had n't asked in front of Eric , she would have turned the invitation down without a second thought . But he had insisted it was time she took her first outing without the baby . <p> Pulling the waistband up around her knees , she gave Eric a worried look . " Are you sure you 'll be okay ? She 's only taken a bottle a few times , you know . She might cry . " <p> " I 'll deal with it . " <p> " But- " <p> He held up a finger . " No buts . She 's five weeks old . In three weeks she 'll be taking a bottle at the daycare center when you go back to work . She needs to get used to it . " <p> Tears stung Allie 's eyes , and she looked away so Eric would n't see . " I guess you 're right . " <p> " Of course I am . Now finish getting dressed while I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Allie sat staring at the handwoven rug in front of their bed . Three weeks . Then she 'd have to leave her precious little Joanie in the hands of a total stranger . <p> If only ... <p> She jerked the shirt over her head . No . One of the things she and Eric had talked about before they got married was how they 'd handle life after they started having children . She 'd insisted on laying it all out , because Eric 's mother had been a stay-at-home mom , and Allie wanted to make absolutely sure he did n't have the same expectations . Her toenail caught the edge of her sock as she tugged it up , and she hissed with pain . No way would she become one of those women relegated to a dull life of child rearing . She was a career woman-the second sock followed the first-with a college degree and plans for her professional future . She liked her job , liked the independence it gave her . Besides , they agreed on having two incomes so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacations at the beach . <p> But that was before she 'd had a baby . <p> If only there was some way she could pursue her career and keep her daughter at home . She had quietly investigated every work-from-home scheme she could find lately , but all of them sounded more like scams than jobs . <p> Banishing the tears , she stood . No sense crying about it . She had no option . In three weeks she 'd return to her job as a team leader at the social services office . She might even be able to recapture some of the excitement and ambition she 'd felt before she got pregnant . At the moment , though , it sounded like a life sentence with no chance of parole . <p> She pulled her jeans up over her knees . This was the first pair of zippered pants she 'd tried to wear since Joanie 's birth , having lived in sweats and oversized T-shirts once she put away the maternity clothes . Wiggling her hips back and forth , she inched them upward . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were her biggest jeans , stretchy and so loose that she 'd worn them all the way up to her fifth month of pregnancy . Just a little farther ... <p> Ugh . She panted from the effort . But at least she 'd managed to get them pulled all the way up . <p> Now the zipper . Suck that gut in . Pull hard . Harder . She hopped up and down , tugging at the waistband . Okay , if the zipper would n't go all the way to the top , it did n't matter . She 'd just wear her shirttail out . Everybody did these days . As long as she could get the button fastened . <p> There ! They fit ! She was wearing pre-baby Levis ! Well , sort of . <p> She stepped up to the mirror and bit back a gasp . <p> The stupid thing had to be warped . <p> * * * <p> " Hey , look at you all dressed up . " Joan stood on the doorstep , car keys clutched in one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried not to think of the jeans she could almost wear shoved in the back of her bottom drawer . " These are maternity pants . Nothing else fits . " <p> " Oh . " Joan 's smile drooped a fraction , then brightened again . " But that 's not a maternity shirt . And turquoise is totally your color . " <p> Her eyes shifted to a point inside the room , then she practically bowled Allie over as she rushed toward the swing to snatch up the baby . Sighing , Allie closed the door . So much for Joanie 's nap . <p> Allie tried to ignore a wave of insecurity as she admired her sister 's slim frame , the way her jeans fit without a single bulge . Straight dark hair fell forward to tickle the baby 's face as Joan cooed at her slumbering namesake while she unfastened the safety strap . Soft baby noises answered as little Joanie 's eyelids fluttered open . Allie clasped her hands together to keep from taking the infant from her middle sister 's arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists rose above her head and she kicked her legs out to their full length and arched her back to stretch . <p> " Look at her ! I swear she 's grown an inch since the last time I saw her . " <p> Allie answered dryly . " I doubt that , since you came over yesterday . " She held her hands out . " Here , let me change her . " <p> Joan clutched the baby closer . " I 'll do it . " <p> With a sigh , Allie followed her sister into the nursery . Bright pink daisies on fields of green bordered the white walls and also decorated lacy curtains and crib bedding . Joan laid Joanie on a daisy-covered pad atop the changing table . While she unsnapped the pink onesie , Allie took a diaper from the stacker and popped open the plastic cap on the wipes . The sweet smell of baby powder was quickly replaced with a less pleasant odor when Joan peeled the tape off the dirty diaper . <p> Eric stuck his head through the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan . " Whew , I 'm glad you girls got that out of the way before you left . Of course , the way this little piggie eats , I probably have at least one unpleasant surprise in store tonight . " <p> " Do n't worry . " Allie dropped the soiled bundle into the Diaper Genie and twisted the knob . " We wo n't be gone very long . I 'm sure we 'll be back for the next dirty diaper . " <p> " I 'm kidding , Allie . You know I do n't mind taking care of my girl . " He leaned over and buried a kiss in Joanie 's chubby neck , eliciting a gurgle and an excited waving of arms and legs . <p> Joan snapped the onesie back in place over the fresh diaper and picked up the squirming infant . Allie stepped forward to take her , but instead Joan thrust her into Eric 's arms . <p> " It 's time to go . I do n't want to be late . " With a meaningful glance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eric right behind her with Joanie hugged tightly to his chest . <p> Left alone in the nursery , Allie fought a wave of panic that caused her throat to tighten with unshed tears . Cheerful daisies mocked her . She knew this feeling , had sensed the edges of it creeping toward her all day . The moment had come . After five weeks of constantly being in Joanie 's presence , she was about to leave her in someone else 's care . <p> Do n't be ridiculous . She scrubbed at her eyes with the back of her hand . Joanie was n't staying with a stranger . She was staying with her daddy ! He 'd watched her many times while Allie enjoyed a long bath or a nap . <p> But what if she cries ? What if she misses me ? <p> She started toward the living room , and then stopped short as an even more distressing thought struck her . What if she does n't even notice I 'm gone ? <p> " Allie , are you coming ? " <p> Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think about that . <p> " I 'm ready . " <p> One step took her from the hallway into their tiny living room , where Eric had deposited Joanie on the mat beneath her baby gym . Allie fought to suppress a wave of regret when chubby infant hands waved with erratic enthusiasm at the dangling toys , and happy coos filled the room . It had only been in the past few days that she 'd started noticing the toys . She was growing so fast , changing every day . What if she did something really cool for the first time tonight , while Allie was n't here to see it ? She dropped to her knees and showered Joanie 's face with goodbye kisses . <p> " There are a couple of bottles all ready to go in the fridge , " she told Eric . " Run hot water over them to warm them . Do n't use the microwave . " <p> Eric stood and pulled her up with him . " I wo n't . " He planted a kiss on her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll probably be hungry around eight . If she gets fussy before- " <p> Joan grabbed her arm and steered her forcefully toward the front door . " Come along , Mother . It 's time to go . " <p> Thoughts of all the terrible things that could happen pummeled her mind like giant hailstones . She pulled away and whirled toward Eric . " Do n't give her a bath until I get home . You know how slippery she is when she 's soapy . " <p> He put his hands on her shoulders and turned her to face the door . " Stop worrying . We 'll be fine . Now go have a good time . " A gentle shove pushed her forward . <p> From the porch , Joan seized her and jerked her through the doorway . Allie shook her off and spun around to remind Eric to put the baby 's sweater on because the house would cool when the sun went down , but the front door slammed shut in her face . Tears welled in her eyes . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chest and leveled an unsympathetic look on her . <p> Allie sniffled . " It 's the first time we 've been apart in five weeks . " <p> " Then it 's about time you gave the poor kid some breathing room . " She shook her head . " You 're becoming one of those hovering mothers . I can totally see you stalking her on the kindergarten playground during recess . " <p> Actually , Allie did n't see a problem with dropping by to check on your kids during the day , but in the face of Joan 's sardonic expression , she did n't dare mention it . Instead she lifted a chin . " I will not be a hovering mother . " <p> A snort blasted from her sister 's nose . " I know my big sister . You 'll hover like a helicopter . " <p> Her head held high , Allie marched past Joan toward the driveway . " I thought you did n't want to be late . " <p> She rubbed her hands on her arms . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was rapidly dropping toward the horizon . They 'd shoved her out the door without a jacket , but she did n't dare go back inside now or she 'd never hear the end of it . Serve them both right if she caught pneumonia and died . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
