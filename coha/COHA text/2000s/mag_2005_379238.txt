A few days after Andr Benjamin  --  known musically as Andre 3000 , the wig-wearing , Hey Ya !  --  singing half of the multiplatinum duo OutKast  --  moved to Los Angeles to become an actor , he ran into the film director John Singleton at a health-food restaurant . OutKast had contributed a song to the sound track of Singleton 's Higher Learning , and the two talked amiably until Benjamin mentioned that he was trying to break into movies . " When he said , ' I really want to get into this acting thing , ' I just smiled politely , " says Singleton of the 2002 conversation . " I did n't take him seriously at all because frankly , every rapper in the world says that . " As Benjamin recalls , " The conversation kind of stopped right there . John blew me off . " <P> The dozens of rappers who have come to Hollywood over the past two decades have achieved undeniable commercial success , but only a few  --  Will Smith , Queen Latifah , Mos Def  --  are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves . Undoubtedly there are studio heads with limited conceptions of what those ( mostly African-American ) selves can be , yet there 's also plenty of evidence to suggest that some rappers treat acting as an entitlement rather than a calling . " I 've heard crazy stories about rappers who get big money to be in films who just do n't show up for work , " says Benjamin . " Then the studio spends $200,000 a day to keep the production afloat , so it 's like paying double for them to come to work . That may be why rappers mostly get cast as rappers and crazy guys . " <P> In order to separate himself from the pack , Benjamin , 30 , has spent the past three years taking acting lessons and navigating through Hollywood 's stereotypes about rappers . One measure of his success arrives this Friday . In Four Brothers , a revenge movie about a family of gun-toting , black and white , adopted brothers ( based loosely on the 1965 John Wayne western The Sons of Katie Elder ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The movie was directed by Singleton . " Dre came out here , worked hard and ate the whole humble pie , " says Singleton . " Now things are heating up for him . I 'm lucky to have him in this movie . " <P> Benjamin acknowledges that his slice of humble pie might not have been that large . Unlike most other aspiring actors , he arrived in Los Angeles already famous  --  and rich enough to refuse roles that did n't interest him . On top of that , he says , " when I first moved , I did n't know I loved acting . I did n't even really know I liked it . " His life change was motivated less by a passion for movies than by a frustration with music : he and partner Antwan ( Big Boi ) Patton were feuding over their future direction , and Benjamin felt enormous pressure to make hits . ( The band has not announced its retirement nor any plans for a new album . ) Like others before him , he took advantage of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the William Morris Agency for booking tours , and they have this whole music-movie transition team because , you know , everybody 's doing movies now , " he says wryly . " They assigned me to a transition person and were very casual , like , ' Yeah , maybe just talk to so-and-so while you 're in the office . ' "
