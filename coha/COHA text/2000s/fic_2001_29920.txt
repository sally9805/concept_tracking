I can trace it back with precision to one of those fitful weeks in August , when the thermometer hit triple digits for the tenth day in a row . Even the humidity was high ; unusual for Capital City . The air conditioner in my car had died and at six-fifteen , traffic on the Interstate was stalled behind an overturned truck-and-trailer rig filled with tomatoes on their way to the Campbell 's plant . I would be late picking up Sarah from the sitter 's . Even with this as background , it was an impulsive move . Ten minutes after I got home , I called a realtor I knew and asked the fateful question : How much can I get for the house ? Would you come by for an appraisal ? The real estate market was heating up , like the weather , so in this respect my timing was good . Sarah was out of school , in that awkward gap between fifth grade and middle school , and not looking forward to the switch . Her best friends-twin sisters her same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd met their mother during a legal seminar in which we were both speakers , almost three years ago now . Susan McKay and her daughters lived in San Diego . Susan and I had been seeing a lot of each other , between monthly trips to San Diego and meetings at the halfway point in Morro Bay . For some reason that adults will never comprehend , the kids seemed to bond at that very first meeting . In San Diego , the weather was cool and breezy . And it held the promise of family life , something Sarah and I had been missing for nearly four years . We had spent two weeks visiting in early July , part of that in Ensenada , south of the border . I had become infected with the scent of salt in the air , and the facets of the sun dancing on the surface of the sea at Coronado . In the late afternoon , Susan and I sat on the beach as the girls played in the water . The Pacific appeared as some boundless , undulating crucible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bade farewell and piled into my car . As I looked at my daughter , I could read her mind . Why are we going back to Capital City ? What is there for us ? It took her an hour in the car to verbalize these thoughts , and when she did , I was prepared with all the cold , adult logic a father can command . I have a job there . I have to get back . But you could get another job down here . It takes a long time for a lawyer to build a practice . It 's not that easy . You started once before . You could do it again . Besides we have money now . You said so yourself . On this point she had me . I had made a killing in a civil case eight months earlier , a wrongful death that went to the jury . We 'd hit a verdict , Harry Hinds and I , like gold bars on the pay line of a slot machine . We 'd plucked the insurance company for eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles the wagons in a bad case . A widow with two children was now financially secure , and Harry and I had been left with a tidy nest egg in fees , even after taxes . Still , uprooting my practice was risky . I understand . You 're feeling lonely , I told Sarah . I am lonely , she said . With that I looked at my daughter sitting in the passenger seat next to me , staring doe-eyed , braces and long brown hair , waiting for an answer that made sense . I did n't have one . When my wife , Nikki , died , she left a hole in our lives that I have never been able to fill . As we headed back toward Capital City , the nagging question remained : What is here for us ? The corrosive politics and blistering summer heat of Capital City held few attractions and a great many painful memories . There had been the year of Nikki 's illness that even now I could not blot out . There were places in the house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . Couples who had been friends no longer had anything in common with a widower approaching middle age . And now my daughter wanted to put it all behind us . On a Monday morning , the last week in August , I called Harry into my office . At one time , Harry Hinds had been one of the foremost criminal lawyers in town , trying mostly front-page felonies . Fifteen years ago he lost a death case , and his client lost his life in the state 's gas chamber . Harry was never the same . By the time I opened a practice in the same building where Harry had his offices , he was defending drunk drivers and commiserating with them on bar stools after hours . He came on board to lend a hand with the Talia Potter murder trial , and ever since has been a fixture . Harry 's speciality is the mountains of paper produced in any trial . With a mind like a steel trap , Harry refers to his document searches as " digging through the bullshit to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who hates losing more than I do . I did n't have the heart to tell him I was leaving Capital City , so I put it out as just opening a branch office . He surprised me . His only question was where . When I told him , his eyes lit up . It seemed Harry was game for the move himself . A new practice in a fresh place , the mellow swells of the Pacific , a few boat drinks along the way , maybe snag another big judgment in a civil case and head for the pastures of semi-retirement . In that instant Harry saw himself sipping pia coladas and surveying the swells on their yachts from the veranda of the Del Coronado . Harry has a fanciful imagination . We found an associate to keep things together in the Capital City office . Harry and I were n't ready to burn our bridges . We would take turns trekking back to the home office , keeping one foot in both worlds until we could make the jump south for good . In these months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could leave my daughter with her for a week at a time . When I called Susan 's house on those weeklong trips it was difficult to get Sarah even to come to the phone . When she did , her voice was filled with laughter and the abruptness that tells you that your call is an interruption . For the first time in five years , since Nikki died , our daughter was a carefree child . Even when Susan 's house was burglarized in the late winter , I felt secure in her ability to protect and care for my daughter . Susan is seven years younger than I , a dark-haired beauty , and divorced . She has the fine features and innocent looks of a child , coupled with the mind of a warrior . For eight years , Susan has been the director of Children 's Protective Services in San Diego , an agency that investigates allegations of child abuse and makes recommendations to the DA regarding prosecutions and to the courts regarding child custody . To call Susan 's vocation a job is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the zeal of a true believer . Children are her life . Her training is in early-childhood development where the mantra Save the kids has become a battle cry . We have been seeing each other for more than two years , though even now in San Diego , we do not live together . I moved south to be with her , but-after some discussion-we decided not to move in together . At least not yet . When I moved south , some unstated law of independence dictated that we maintain separate households . It seems we spend increasing amounts of time in each other 's company ; that is , when I am not on the road back to Capital City . That particular Gordian knot will be cut as soon as Harry and I have secured a sufficient client base in the south , which is why today I am renewing an old acquaintance . Jonah and Mary Hale sit across the desk from me . He has aged since I saw him last . Mary looks the same , different hairdo , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Ben 's death and Talia 's murder trial . Oceans of water under that bridge . Jonah was one of my earliest cases in private practice , soon after I left the DA 's office where I 'd cut my teeth . The firm had directed him down the hall to the new man in the cubicle at the end . At the time , Jonah was just a working stiff , a married man in his fifties with a daughter in her late teens . He was getting ready to retire-against his will . He worked for the railroad in Capital City , the locomotive works which was in its death throes . Jonah had a chronic bad back and knees , thanks to years of toil on hard concrete lifting machine parts . So when the railroad was looking to downsize , he was an immediate candidate to go . Even now he walks with a cane , though this one is much more ornate than the plain curved-handled wooden stick I had seen him with back then . " The legs do n't get any better with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his chair to find the point of relative comfort . " But the smile is as good as ever , " I tell him . " Only because I 've found an old friend . I only hope you can help me . " Jonah has the good looks of an aging Hemingway , with all the wrinkles in the right places . Even with his infirmities he has not put on weight . His tanned face is framed by a shock of white hair . His beard is close cropped , his eyes deep-set and gray . He is a rugged-looking man , well dressed , with a dark sweater-vest under a cashmere sport coat , and light-colored slacks . On his wrist is a gold watch the size of an oyster , a Rolex he could never have afforded in the old days . I introduce him to Harry . " I 've heard a lot about you , " says Harry . Jonah just smiles . He is used to this by now : people coming up , slapping him on the back , cozying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up , " he tells Harry . " Everybody assumes that you had something to do with it . " " Well , you did buy the ticket , " says Harry . " Yes . And there have been times when I wish he had n't , " says Mary . " Having money can be its own curse , " Jonah tells us . One senses that he means what he says . Jonah won the largest lottery payout in state history : $87 million . He had purchased the ticket five years after I 'd won his case , securing a disability from the railroad that paid him $26,000 a year plus medical benefits for life . " I could n't believe it when I saw your name in the phone book . I told Mary when I saw your name it had to be you , or your kid . How many Paul Madrianis could there be ? Especially lawyers . " " One of a kind , " says Harry . " Broke the mold . " " So what can we do for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Jonah . " I do n't think you 've ever met Jessica . " " I do n't think so . " " I went to the police . But they said it was n't a criminal matter . Can you believe it ? She 's kidnapped my granddaughter , and the police tell me it is n't criminal . They ca n't get involved . " " Kidnapped ? " I ask . " I do n't know what else to call it . For three weeks now , going on a month , I been runnin ' around like a chicken without my head . Going to the police . Following up with the lawyer we hired . " " There 's another lawyer ? " " Yeah , but he ca n't do anything . Supposedly nobody can . " " Calm down . Tell me what happened . " " My granddaughter , Amanda , is eight years old . She 's lived with us , Mary and me , almost since the day she was born . " " She 's your daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that 's what you mean , " he says . " She 's not what you would call a good mother . Jessica 's had problems with drugs . Been in and out of jail . " He pauses to look at Harry and me . " The fact is , she spent two years in the women 's correctional facility at Corona . " This is not jail , but state prison . Harry lifts an eyebrow in question and before he can put it to words , Jonah responds . " For drugs . She was caught transporting a quantity of cocaine across the border for a dealer down in Mexico . God knows where she meets these people . We paid for her attorney . He made some kind of a deal with the federal government so that she could serve her time in a state facility rather than a federal penitentiary , supposedly so she could be closer to Amanda . The fact is , she 's never really shown much interest in Mandy . That 's what we call her , Mary and I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a small leather container . It looks as if it is designed to hold expensive fountain pens . He opens it , and I see cigars . " Do you mind ? " Mary shoots him a disapproving look . Ordinarily my office is a smoke-free zone , but I make an exception . He offers me one , but I decline . Harry accepts . " My doctor says I should n't smoke . My only vice , besides the boat and fishing . Do you ever go out ? " he asks . " Sport fishing ? " I shake my head . Jonah is wandering now , trying to avoid a painful subject . " You should try it sometime . Soothes the soul . I 'll take you out on the Amanda . " The words stick in his throat for a second . " I named it after my granddaughter . She used to love to go out . " " Enough with the boat , " says Mary . " Our daughter wanted money . She always wanted money . That ticket was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Left her with us and gone about her life , such as it was . But with all that money . . . It was its own kind of narcotic . " " She came to me for money when she got out . Said she wanted to start a business . I said I would n't give her any . I knew the money would go into her arm , or up her nose , for drugs . Or to one of those bums she 's habitually shacked up with . My daughter 's taste in men leaves a lot to be desired . She is too attractive for her own good . " He pulls his wallet out of an inside coat pocket , and from it he plucks a photograph . He hands it across the desk to me . " She had her hair cut like Meg Ryan , the movie star . Everybody kept telling her she looked like her . " I look at the photo . Her friends were n't lying . Jessica is blond , cute in a sexy kind of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most endearing feature is her smile , which , if you stopped there , would mark her as the kid next door . Her jeans look like they had been molded to her body , and a tank top leaves little to the imagination . Slumped over her , hugging her from behind , is a guy in a leather vest and no shirt . I can see a tattoo on one arm and , though the picture is too indistinct , I can imagine needle tracks below the elbow . " Jessica always seemed to collect the losers , " says Jonah . " Tattoos up the ass . Worthless men living on the backs of motorcycles . You know the kind . " He looks at me through a smoke veil and takes a puff . " This is Mandy . " Jonah hands me another snapshot . Mandy is in a school uniform . Her hair is tied in a neat ponytail with wisps escaping at the sides . " Mandy 's hair is a little longer now , " says Mary . " At least I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The police told us they do that sometimes . And dress ' em up to look like boys . So a picture in the paper , on a milk carton does n't do any good , " adds Jonah . Harry looks at the photo of Jessica , an appraising eye . " How old is she ? " " Jessica 's twenty-eight . She survives to be thirty , it 'll be a miracle . That 's why we got ta get Mandy back . Different man with her mother every night . Some of them pretty bad . " " What about the girl 's father ? " says Harry . " Your guess is as good as mine , " says Jonah . " Nobody ever came forward , and Jessica was n't talking . " " Who has legal custody ? " I ask . " We had temporary custody when Jess went to prison . Now it 's permanent . Not that it does a damn bit of good . " Jessica only got interested in Mandy after I won the lotto . Her message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , and the collateral was Mandy . Unless I paid , she would be taking her back as soon as she got out . I offered to buy her a house . Of course I would n't put it in her name . I was n't that foolish . She would have sold it first chance , pocketed the money , and run off . But just the same , I offered to put her up in a good home in the neighborhood where we live . To support her . But she did n't want any part of that . Too many strings attached , she said . " " So you filed a petition for permanent custody ? " says Harry . " Right . We went to court . By that time there were a number of letters from Jessica in Corona . She had n't been too smart . In the letters she threatened to take the child back unless we paid . This did n't put her in a very good light with the court . Though she had the legal right to take Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become like a piece of property in a pawnshop . Her mother would take money in return for leaving her with us , and when that was gone she 'd come back for more . " " I take it Jessica 's out of prison ? " Harry asks . " She got out six months ago , " says Jonah . " Twenty-third of October . I remember the day exactly , because she came to the house . She was different . She looked different . " " Prison has a way of doing that , " I tell him . " No . It was n't that . In fact , she was cleaned up . She looked better than I 'd seen her in years . " " Prison life must have agreed with her , " says Harry . " I think it gave her some discipline . Focus in her life . Only she directed it in all the wrong ways , " says Jonah . " She was well dressed . Nothing fancy , mind you . Pair of slacks and a sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look almost intellectual . She wanted to see Mandy . What could we do ? " " You let them visit ? " " In the living room of our home , " he says . " Mandy 's seen so little of her mother I did n't know how she 'd react . When Jessica walked into the room , Mandy sort of collapsed , like someone had let all the air out of her . " Jonah sighs . " In the living room that day , I felt like someone was ripping the heart out of my chest . Mandy 's stomach hurt for days afterward , just from the stress of her mother 's visit , the fact that she was back in her life . Mary and I thought it might be good for them both if they could spend a little time together , get to know each other , ease in . " But Jessica fell into old habits . She started to manipulate the child . Wanted to take her home . Wherever the hell that was . " " Probably some halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they usually go out of the joint . " " We said no . There was no way we could allow it . Jessica looked me dead in the eye . Told me she was gon na get her child back come hell or high water . That I had no right to take her . This , after she 'd abandoned the kid for the better part of eight years . She said she was going to fight me . In court if necessary . Outside the court if she had to . " " Did she ? " I ask . " She went to court . Got an order of visitation . That 's when the trouble started . " " What kind of trouble ? " says Harry . " Jessica was allowed to take Mandy on weekends . Two weekends a month . She would pick her up on Friday night and return her Sunday afternoon . It went fine for the first month . Then in early December , they did n't come back until late Sunday night . Close to midnight . Each weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Like she was testing me . " " Why did n't you go back to court ? " " Because the lawyer I had told me that unless we had something substantial , a serious violation of the terms of visitation , the court was n't likely to do anything except warn her . He said it would only make matters worse . " Jonah 's lawyer had a point . " Then , finally , three weeks ago , she did n't bring Mandy back at all . We were frantic . I called the number where Jessica was supposed to be living . We were told she 'd moved . They did n't know where . We called the police . They told us they could n't do a thing-not unless we had evidence that some crime had been committed . We told them we had a court order of custody . They told us we 'd have to go to court , ask the judge to hold Jessica in contempt for violating the order . " " But she brought her back ? " says Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandy comes through the front door , Jessica right behind her as if nothing had happened . And they were n't alone . " " One of Jessica 's boyfriends ? " says Harry . Jonah shakes his head . " A woman . " " What woman ? " I ask . Jonah fishes in his pocket , pulls out a business card , and hands it to me . On the card in bold italic are the words : Women 's Defense Forum Underneath it in letters larger than the organization 's is the name : Zolanda " Zo " Suade Director " Without so much as a how do you do , she 's in my face , " says Jonah . " This other woman . She tells me she knows all about me . That because I have a lot of money , won the lottery , I think I can do whatever I want , that I can steal my daughter 's child . " I tell her I have a court order . " She tells me that it 's worthless . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't recognize court orders , and that if I know what 's good for me I 'll simply turn Mandy back over to her mother . " By this time I 'm about ready to deck this broad . " Jonah looks at Harry . " Excuse my language , " he says . " But I was ready to kill . " I told her to leave . She refused . She said they 'd leave when they were good and ready . Finally , I told her I was gon na call the cops , and Mary , she starts moving toward the phone . That 's when this Zolanda . . . " Jonah makes the name sound like the word should have four letters . " That 's when she decides it 's time to leave . But not before she tells me I have a choice . I can either give Mandy up willingly , or we can lose her . Either way , she says , Jessica 's gon na get her child back . " " Did she leave ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a leaf . If I 'd had this in my hand at that moment " - he holds up the cane- " I think I 'd a hit her . I woulda crushed her head like a walnut . Luckily I did n't . Amanda was crying . She was standing there listening to all of this . She does n't like friction , arguments . She ca n't deal with it . It gives her stomach pains . And here I am shouting with some stranger who 's threatening to take her away . " First thing I do is call my lawyer . I tell ya , this guy 's not half the lawyer you are , Paul . Anyway , I tell the lawyer what 's going on , and the minute I mention this woman 's name , this Zolanda , he asks me where my granddaughter is . I tell him she 's standing right beside me . He does n't say a thing , but I can hear the sigh of relief over the phone , like somebody who just woke up from a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell she is , the devil ? " ' She may not be the devil , ' he says , ' but as far as you 're concerned , she 's got the keys to hell . ' He tells me we 've got to get back to court fast , before the weekend . And no matter what happens , he says , I am not to turn Amanda over to my daughter for visitation . Even if the sheriff shows up with a court order , he says . Just stall him until I can get Amanda away from the house . " By this time we 're really gettin ' worried . Mary 's frantic . You can imagine . " " I can , " I tell him . " Have you ever heard of this woman ? " he asks . I shake my head . " But then I 'm new to town . " " Apparently she has a reputation beyond San Diego , " he tells me . " There 's been national publicity . " " I have n't seen it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family law . " " What the lawyer told me turned out to be . . . whaddaya call it ? " Jonah searches for the word , ca n't come up with it . " Prophetic ? " says Harry . Jonah snaps his fingers , the hand propped on the cane . " That 's it . We were doing everything to take precautions . We were taking Mandy to school and picking her up afterward . Driving her everywhere . We told her teachers that she was not to leave the school grounds with anyone but Mary or me . " What we did n't figure was that it would happen in our own house . Four days ago I have a doctor 's appointment . Mary takes me there . " " Where was Amanda ? " says Harry . " We left Amanda home with a sitter , a young woman in her early twenties . She 's sat for us many times . I figure , what could happen ? We were scheduled to go back to court on Friday . The lawyer told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order amended to require Jessica to see Amanda only in our home , under our supervision . " My daughter must have been outside , watching . Ten minutes after we leave she shows up at the front door . She 's alone and wants to see Mandy . The sitter told her she had strict instructions . " My daughter is a practiced con artist . She tells you noon is midnight , smiles that cute little smile , and nine times out of ten you 'd believe her . She 's calm , reasonable , well dressed . She tells the sitter she 's driven all the way across town to tell Amanda something about a surprise present for her grandma . Mary 's birthday is eight months off . Still it 's a hot secret between mother and daughter . " Baby-sitter does n't know what to do . She tells Jessica she 's got instructions . " Jessica gets all reasonable and understanding . You know the rap , " says Jonah . " ' Last thing I 'd want to do is get you in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you want me to do it again ? Sure , no problem . ' " So the girl lets her in . Jessica asks for a cup of coffee . The sitter goes to make it in the kitchen . She was gone three minutes . " He holds up three fingers . " That 's all it took . When she came back to the living room , they were gone . Jessica and Amanda both . She looked through the front window just in time to see the car backing down the driveway , tires screeching . A man was driving . Another man was in the passenger seat . There were two figures in the back . " " Jessica and Amanda , " says Harry . Jonah nods . " We have n't seen them since . " " Did the sitter get a license plate off the car ? " I ask . He shakes his head . " Just a description . Late-model sedan , a two-door , dark in color . " " No description of the driver ? " " She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I know this woman 's involved . This Zolanda Suade . " " Let me guess , " I say . " The sitter did n't see her the day they disappeared ? " " No . But who else could it be ? She as much as told us she was gon na take Mandy . And there 's more . My lawyer says that 's what she does . Suade has an organization that specializes in this . " " What ? Kidnapping children ? " says Harry . " Yes . She 's done it in other cases . The FBI . The police . Nobody can stop her . " " Why the hell not ? " says Harry . I answer the question before Jonah can : " Because she uses a parent in the abduction . " He points at me with his finger as if to say Just so . " It 's why they wo n't get involved . They say technically it 's not kidnapping . Violation of the court order of custody , maybe . " " But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it gets worse , " says Jonah . " They 've taken her across the border . Somewhere into Mexico . " " How do you know that ? " " Cuz that 's what the lawyer told me . He says she 's taken others across . Somewhere down in Baja , but he does n't know where . " " Why does she do it ? " says Harry . " What 's in it for her ? " " She 's a feminist nut , " says Jonah . " Has a problem with men . She has this organization to help wayward women and their children . Self-appointed crusader , " says Jonah . " Only this time she 's chewed off more than she can swallow . I 'll bury the bitch . " As he says this , I can see the vein in the side of his head bulge . For a moment I 'm afraid he will blow a major vessel in his brain , keel over on my desk . " But how can I help you ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my granddaughter is . " " You need an investigator , not a lawyer . " " Fine . Hire one . Hire the best , " he tells me . " But I want you to be in charge . I trust you .

" " You do if there are sizzling wires in the water , " says Jonah . " I 've already talked to the other lawyer about hiring an investigator . He says I 'd be wasting my time . Suade 's too careful . She covers her tracks . Calls from pay phones . Never visits the places where she has the mothers and children holed up . She uses middlemen . It 's like an underground railroad .

My principal concern at the moment is whether I would be taking the man 's money on false pretenses . " I ca n't make a commitment , " I tell him . " There really is no legal case . Other than the violation of the court order of custody . " " Then start with that , " he says . " We have no direct evidence that this woman , this Zolanda Suade , was involved .

" We can at least do that much . " Jonah is desperate , and now he 's found an ally . Anyone not knowing Harry might be tempted to say that he is merely greedy . But I know him better . He 's a soft touch . He sees Jonah 's problem as one with merit . Even if Jonah were financially destitute , Harry would be pitching me to get involved , to tilt at this windmill . The fact that Jonah has money makes it that much easier . " We can look into it , " I finally say . There are smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke . From The Attorney , Steve Martini .
