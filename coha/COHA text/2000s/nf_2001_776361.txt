The First Song // Native American Music // AMONG OTHER THINGS , historians search for origins . But if we take history to mean stories about the past that can be supported by facts , the origins of music will always be elusive . Music is an art of sounding , not writing . And the making of musical sounds is a human activity , like dance , that must be much older than written proof of its existence . In Western civilization , with its profound respect for the written record , the origins of music are a subject of speculation . But in many American Indian cultures , the origins of music are a matter of deep-seated belief . // A comparison of Native and Western musical practices reveals different conceptions of history . In literate , record-keeping Western traditions , musicians seldom feel the need to ground their performing in a consciousness of the history of their art . Many Indian people , on the other hand , participate in their music 's history through rituals , legends , and parables shared from one generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how their singing , dancing , and playing connect with ancestral custom . // The preservation and study of Indian music by Western scholars since the 1880s forms an important part of the story of American anthropology and ethnomusicology ( see Chapter 20 ) . In fact , outsiders ' accounts date all the way back to the beginnings of European contact . These accounts are usually anecdotal ; they are also both fragmentary and rare . Their value is that they preserve most of the factual evidence about Indian music that survives from the remote past . But where do Native historical explanations fit in a modern understanding of Indian music making ? // Because it can not be documented , much of the historical knowledge valuable to a Native musician falls more readily into the category of myth than of fact . Indian musicians carry their beliefs about origins forward because such beliefs are integral to their tradition . A knowledge of origins can supply not merely a colorful dose of background lore but a reason to sing , play , or dance . Blackfoot singers , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humans to help them solve the problems they must face in life . Thus , they sing with a specific purpose in mind . By the same token , according to the traditional belief system of the Havasupai nation , before humans existed , supernatural beings sang to communicate among themselves . When humans arrived on the earth , they were given music so that they could communicate with the supernatural world . In Havasupai tradition , therefore , singing establishes a sacred context . In the 1970s , Navajo singer Frank Mitchell explained a parallel belief about music , tracing some of his songs back to the origins of the Navajo people : // According to what I learned , a group came up from under the earth  --  they must have been some kind of supernatural beings . They were given this area of land within the four sacred mountains . It was in this area that the Navajos had their beginnings . // The whole place was covered with water at that time . Then the water was removed so something could be planted and grow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean , perhaps . And from there the first songs and prayers of the Blessingway had their start . They were for the planting of crops . The first thing the Holy People did was to make a song and a prayer for the plants on the earth so the earth would be fruitful . That was the first song and the first prayer to be performed , and they were the first ones that I learned . // European and Native cosmologies could hardly be more different . From the time of their arrival in North America , Europeans have tended to treat human interaction  --  whether as part of God 's plan or outside it  --  as the chief drama of existence , played out against the backdrop of nature . American Indians , on the other hand , have traditionally held that the central fact of human existence has been its location in a natural world replete with significance . Animals , trees , weather , water , and topography , like supernatural beings , all play a role in human existence too , because all are related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that Native Americans have undervalued human life . Rather , they have experienced it as one strand in a fabric of interconnectedness , not a force claiming dominion over the rest of the natural order . It seems only logical , then , that people holding such beliefs would invest their music making with specific functions , and that music would be judged not by its abstract beauty but by its ability to serve those functions . // All human interaction contains a perception of difference and a perception of similarity . A weighing and monitoring of both is part of the human condition . But when members of two completely separate cultures come into contact on a massive scale , and in circumstances where each is pursuing a different goal , perceptions of difference and similarity can carry vast historical consequences . That was certainly true of the contact between Native peoples and Europeans on the North American continent . And because the history of Indian music making depends heavily on the way Europeans perceived the Natives  --  on how they compared themselves with the people they were encountering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be understood in light of those perceptions . // European 's perceptions of Natives were formed in a framework of political struggle in which they held the advantage , and which was marked by profound human suffering : for Europeans carried with them to the New World infectious diseases to which Native Americans had no resistance . Estimates hold that chiefly because of disease , Mexico 's population dropped by more than 90 percent in the first century of Spanish-Indian contact . The Native population , while trying to cope with overseas invaders , experienced sudden , drastic , and disastrous demographic decline . Biology , then , played a decisive role in the cultural encounters that accompanied the process of settlement . // Economics played another role . North America was colonized by imperial powers eager to tap into New World wealth , whether in gold , furs , agricultural products , or , eventually , markets for Old World goods . And there is evidence that early commercial exchanges were not all weighted in the Europeans ' favor . Cultural development in the Old and New Worlds had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other . Yet Natives and Europeans held very different positions in the economics of settlement . Europeans had initiated contact in the first place , and the urge to expand their influence placed them in the role of aggressors . It was inevitable that those who resisted their invasion would be considered enemies . Therefore , an imperial relationship was assumed from the start . Because the Europeans , with their biological advantage , superior commercial know-how , and technological skill , prevailed in the New World , their perceptions of the Natives , far more than the Natives ' perception of them , set the terms for cultural encounters . And because the spirit of those encounters filtered what was written about Indian music making during that time period , white attitudes toward the Native population deserve attention here . // Two contrasting attitudes have been distinguished in Europeans ' perception of Natives , one emphasizing similarity , and the other difference . When Europeans , in taking over and colonizing lands already occupied by others , encountered those they hoped to displace , they were struck most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , in the wilds of a supposedly unoccupied continent , the first European explorers found walking , talking , communicating human beings . Living beyond the reach of Western civilization , these people had developed customs different from the colonizers ' own . But their obviously human essence made them fascinating and to some degree sympathetic . At the same time , although it was impossible to deny that Indians shared with Europeans certain traits of appearance and what could pass for language and a certain vocabulary of emotion , their manner of life , customs , dress , land behavior differed so dramatically from white Europeans ' conceptions of humanness that they seemed a different order of being altogether . // European reactions to these contrasting perceptions of Natives ' " otherness " shaped the history of Indians ' lives in North America after European contact . The perception of similarity led settlers to dwell on the Natives ' capacity for human virtue as the settlers defined it . If Indians had capacities similar to those of Europeans , then Europeans could supply what Indians needed to reach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction to save their souls from the damnation that lay in store for heathens . Beginning especially in the Southwest ( where the Spanish , moving north from Mexico , had formed settlements ) and in the Northeast ( where the French had set up trading posts in Canada ) , Roman Catholic missionaries traveled from the Old World to convert the Natives and to set up mission schools for their education . // The perception of difference , however , suggested an unbridgeable gulf between Natives and settlers ; against a scale of European values , the Indians were found wanting . This attitude fueled contempt , which in disputes could provide license to disparage , cheat , brutalize , kill , or remove the Natives from land the settlers wanted to occupy . Yet not even the first attitude left room for much curiosity about the Indians as they actually were . In their contact with the Indians , European settlers showed a consistent inability to grasp the idea that there might be people truly different from themselves . Thus , they tended to equate similarity with good qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians spans more than four centuries , and any attempt to summarize it risks oversimplifying . Yet the categories of " good Indian " and " bad Indian " were used consistently enough in the past to become paradigms for Euroamerican perceptions . The so-called good Indians were seen to be friendly , modest , dignified , and brave , and to lead simple lives devoted to their families and closely in tune with nature . It was this idealized perception that inspired European attempts to educate and Christianize Native peoples . Settlers who favored the " bad Indian " image tended , when they considered the way Indians lived , to see nakedness and sexual promiscuity , superstition , laziness , cannibalism and human sacrifice , constant warfare , desire for revenge , and cruelty to captives . Nor did Europeans ' observations of Indian cookery and personal hygiene do much to raise their opinion of Indian life . // The historical record reflects the destructiveness that followed when dichotomies like the good Indian/bad Indian images took hold . Drawing on observations that made no claim of completeness or balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small selection of facts , " Image " is the right word to register their lack of depth . Yet both hardened into beliefs from which flowed courses of action that failed , at every point , to take , either the diversity or the uniqueness of Native cultures into account . // Music // Our knowledge about the early history of Native American music depends on reports by non-Natives . The character and usefulness of those reports varies , not only with the observers ' own musical knowledge but with their empathy for the Indians . One of the earliest observations was made in the 1530s by a Spanish chronicler who , along with three countrymen , had landed years earlier in Florida and undertaken a long journey west , providing medical treatment to several Natives along the trail . Upon reaching an Indian settlement in what is now western Texas near Big Spring , they were greeted by " all the people ... with such yells as were terrific , striking the palms of their hands violently against their thighs . " ( Might another observer have heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowing . ) The Natives ' enthusiasm had been inspired by their guests ' reputation as healers . They presented the honored visitors with devices that fit the classification of an idiophone ( a musical instrument that produces sound by the vibration of its own substance ; by being struck or shaken , for example ) ; one of the Spaniards described them as " gourds bored with holes and having pebbles in them , an instrument for the most important occasions produced only at the dance or to effect cures , and which none dare touch but those who own them . They say there is virtue in them , and because they do not grow in that country , they come from heaven . " // Continuing west , the Spaniards found that their fame as medicine men had preceded them . Natives in the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico gave them more idiophones : a " jingle bell of copper " and two medicine rattles . Another account from New Mexico in 1540 reaffirms the Indians ' functional use of musical sound , this time reporting scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by Captain Hernando de Alvarado approached a Zu ? i pueblo in Pecos , they were welcomed " with drums and flageolets , similar to fifes , of which they had many . " One Spaniard also described how music served in the Zu ? is ' ceremonial grinding of corn . // Three women come in , each going to her stone . One crushes the maize , the next grinds it , and the third grinds it finer . Before they come inside the door they remove their shoes , tie up their hair and cover it , and shake their clothes . While they are grinding , a man sits at the door playing a flageolet , and the women move their stones , keeping time with the music , and all three sing together . // These reports from the Southwest , less than half a century after Columbus landed in the Western hemisphere , supply some of the first evidence of Native instruments and uses of music . But they say nothing about its sound . On the other hand , when early observers did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus on their own response  --  often negative  --  than on the sound itself . A case in point is the experience of the Jesuit father Paul Le Jeune with a medicine man in the winter of 1634 , as related by nineteenth-century American historian Francis Parkman . Parkman 's account makes no attempt to treat the music making on its own terms . Nor is it specific enough to show , as one gathers , that the performance 's great length was made possible by much musical repetition . But it does testify to the Hurons ' faith that the physical exertion of vocalizing and time beating as part of a healing ritual could help cure a lingering malady . // The sorcerer believed in the efficacy of his own magic , and was continually singing and beating his drum to cure the disease from which he was suffering . Toward the close of the winter , Le Jeune fell sick , and , in his pain and weakness , nearly succumbed under the nocturnal uproar of the sorcerer , who , hour after hour , sang and drummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat , then hissing like a serpent , then striking his drum on the ground as if in a frenzy , then leaping up , raving about the wigwam , and calling on the women and children to join him in singing . Now ensued a hideous din ; for every throat was strained to the utmost , and all were beating with sticks or fists on the bark of the hut to increase the noise , with the charitable object of aiding the sorcerer to conjure down his malady , or drive away the evil spirit that caused it . // Le Jeune was later to write of the Hurons : " All their religion consists mainly in singing . // Not until later in the seventeenth century did a musically knowledgeable Westerner write down a Native melody heard within the borders of the present United States and describe the circumstances in which he heard it  --  and these circumstances were very different from those surrounding the Hurons ' efforts to drive Father Le Jeune 's ailment into submission . The transcriber was another Jesuit priest , Father Claude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments , which , according to a contemporaneous report , he played very well . Dablon and fellow Jesuit Father Claude Allouz had established a mission at Green Bay on Lake Michigan in 1669 . In 1670 , the two priests visited the present Winnebago County , Wisconsin , where friendly Mascouten , Miami , and Illinois tribes had gathered . Dablon found the Illinois to be polite and their chief especially kind . Sometimes , he reported " some of the oldest men would appear , dressed as if for playing a comedy , and would dance to the music of some very tuneful airs , which they sang in excellent accord . " // The music Dablon transcribed accompanied a dance honoring the peace pipe , or " calumet . " Among the Illinois , men and women with the best voices were chosen to sing for the occasion ; berdaches ( transvestites who assumed the dress , social status , and role of woman ) , " who are summoned to the Councils and without whose advice nothing can be decided , " sang as well . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singing , and a mock combat was fought to the slow beat of a drum : " This is done so well  --  with slow and measured steps , and to the rhythmic sound of the voices and drums  --  that it might pass for a very fine Entry of a Ballet in France . " // Admitting that his transcription failed to do justice to the way the music actually sounded , Dablon wrote : " They give their songs a certain turn which can not be sufficiently expressed by Note , but which nevertheless endows them with all their grace . " Dablon did not explain the double bars that divide the melody into three sections , but one or more of those sections were surely repeated many times in performance . An Illinois calumet dance described by French observers only four years after Dablon made his transcription was long as well as stately . " Everyone , at the outset , takes the Calumet in a respectful manner , and , supporting it with both hands , causes it to dance , in cadence . keeping good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account , which goes on to say that the leading dancer causes the pipe to " execute many differing figures ; sometimes he shows it to the whole assembly , turning himself from one side to the other . " In other words , the dance had a narrative quality that filled a considerable length of time . // It is not hard to imagine why Dablon took the trouble to preserve this melody in notation , for it shows a clarity and regularity that lend themselves well to visual representation . The three sections are themselves parallel in certain ways . All begin high and move downward : all seem to take aim on one pitch , which then , through repetition , becomes a tonic resting place for that section ; and all , by mixing with three-beat groupings an occasional two- beat pair , achieve a gentle , prose-like rhythm . // In the next century , Native music and musical activity were noticed more and more by people who were neither government nor church officials but were fascinated by Indian ways . One example is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euroamerican who described himself as " a trader with the Indians , and resident in their country for forty years " and called his chronicle A History of the American Indians , Particularly Those Nations Adjoining to the Mississippi , East and West Florida , Georgia , South and North Carolina , and Virginia ( London , 1775 ) . In one passage , the trader recalls a visit paid him by " an old physician , or prophet ' from the Chicasaw nation . And he describes the medicine man 's performance in detail , though without the help of musical notation . // When he came to the door he bowed himself half bent , with his arms extended north and south , continuing so perhaps for the space of a minute . Then raising himself erect , with his arms in the same position , he looked in a wild frightful manner , from the south-west toward the north , and sung on a low bass key Yo Yo Yo Yo , almost a minute , then He He He He , for perhaps the same space of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner ; and then transposed , and accented those sacred notes several different ways , in a most rapid guttural manner . Now and then he looked upwards , with his head considerably bent backward ;  --  his song continued about a quarter of an hour . // Knowing from experience that the Indians were " tenacious of concealing their religious mysteries , " the writer expressed delight in the prophet 's song when he learned its purpose : it was the visitor 's way of protecting the trader 's house " from the power of the evil spirits of the north , south , and west ,  --  and , from witches , and wizards , who go about in dark nights , in the shape of bears , hogs , and wolves , to spoil people . " // A round-the-world voyage during the 1780s produced another example of notated Native music , this one from the other side of the continent . In 1787 , William Beresford , cargo officer on board the Queen Charlotte , a ship commanded by Captain George Dixon , wrote : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I often heard whilst we lay in Norfolk Sound " in the northern Pacific near the present site of Sitka , Alaska . " It will serve , " Beresford explained , " to convey a better idea of the music used on the American coast than any other mode of description can do ; at the same time it should be observed that they have a great variety of tunes , but the method of performing them is universally the same . " Beresford claimed that the Natives generally sang this song " previous to commencing trade . " His notation specifies independent parts for " the Chief ( who always conducts the vocal concert ) " and the chorus , in which both men and women sing . // According to Beresford , the chief wore a robe when leading this song and carried a rattle made of sticks to which " great numbers of birds ' beaks and dried berries are tied . " Through the singing , the chief shook the rattle gleefully , believing that it made " no small addition to the concert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus " to suggest Western analogies to the song he has transcribed . He also confirms that this performance , like many others described by non-Native observers , lasted a long time . // Their songs generally consist of several stanzas , to each of which is added a chorus . The beginning of each stanza is given out by the Chief alone , after which both men and women join and sing in octaves , beating time regularly with their hands , or paddles : meanwhile the Chief shakes his rattle , and makes a thousand gesticulations , singing at intervals in different notes from the rest ; and this mirth generally continues near half an hour without intermission. // From the eighteenth century too come tales of Indian bravery , registered in " death songs " or " war songs " far different in mood from the high-spirited trading songs of Sitka Sound . The circumstances prompting such songs , documented by James Adair in his History and other sources , are grim : a warrior is captured by members of another tribe , subjected to grievous physical torment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The perpetrators seem to be totally lacking in human goodness . First , they do all they can to prolong their victim 's pain : they tie him to a stake , poke and beat him with torches , and then , when suffering and desperation threaten to end their sport , cool him off with water , allowing " a proper time of respite , " the trader writes , " till his spirits recover , and he is capable of suffering new tortures . " Second , the tormenting of the prisoner is staged as community entertainment , with women and children participating . " Not a soul , of whatever age or sex , manifests the least pity , " according to this account . " The women sing with religious joy ... and peals of laughter resound through the crowded theater  --  especially if he fears to die . " This last comment suggest the custom 's only redeeming feature : the spectacle gives the prisoner a chance to show courage . " The suffering warrior , " the trader writes , " is not dismayed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He puts on a bold austere countenance , and carries it through all his pains . " // The notion of a dying warrior who sings stoically in the face of torture and imminent death struck a responsive chord with some European Americans in the years following the War of Independence . In fact , a parlor song about such a victim , The Death Song of the Cherokee Indians , appeared in Royall Tyler 's The Contrast ( 1787 ) , the first play by an American-born writer known to have been produced onstage . The song , a thoroughly Europeanized composition with several stanzas of text , each sung to the same music  --  i.e. , a strophic song  --  was set to a tune claimed by an English source to have originated with the Cherokee tribe . Perhaps its rhythmic repetitiveness made that claim plausible to people unfamiliar with Native music . // As parlor songs are inclined to do , The Death Song of the Cherokee Indians removes a real-life event from its original context and idealizes it . The circumstances that brought the warrior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , but they are shadowy figures , unable to provoke a response . For the protagonist , a symbol of superhuman courage rather than a believable human being , transports himself to a world of memory and devotion to duty Even as the flames rise to consume his body , " the son of Alknomook , " maintaining a flow of regular two-bar phrases for four full stanzas , " will never complain . " // But the Death Song comes not from the Cherokees nor indeed any other Indian tribe . It is a product of European culture , inspired by Native imagery of the good Indian variety . Its appearance in a stage play of 1787 , a collection of published songs in i789 , and sheet music from around 1799 is a reminder that by 1800 the new nation called the United States of America had its own means to make and sell cultural products . The Native , or rather the image of the Native , provided material for that industry , as did many other creatures and features of the national landscape . // After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Native custom , is it still possible today to find Indian musical traditions that are practiced as they were two or even three centuries ago ? For historians , no clear answer exists . But for many Natives , the question is unimportant . As they see it , they are still making the music that was passed on to them by parents and elders , who in turn learned it from generations before them  --  and they sing , play , and dance for the same reasons . They are engaged in preservation , not of historically significant old songs but of a legacy that connects them to the past and to nature , from which they continue to gain physical and spiritual sustenance .
