/Jan 2006 REVIEW CRAIG NUTT Southern Ohio Museum , Portsmouth * June 4-August 27 , 2005 Whimsy is the dominant attribute of Craig Nutt 's " Flying Objects &; Tossed Salads , " an exhibition of brightly painted furniture and sculpture focused on the humble vegetable . Vegetables represent great variety , and Nutt exploits this to the fullest . In a single furniture piece he may present several kinds , juxtaposing colors and shapes . Yet the effect is never chaotic as he skillfully balances variety with design unity . Nutt 's subject matter can be explained partly by his family ties to rural Iowa , but there is also the technical challenge of presenting the vegetable as painted wood sculpture . He is a master of disrupted scale , allowing the viewer to see common objects in a magical new light . In his hands , carrots become behemoths and snow peas tower over asparagus spears . The museum 's Richards Gallery was dominated by Nine Carrot Treasure Chest . 2001 , a tall piece topped by a giant carrot , poised on its pointed end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carrots are the drawer knobs . The carrot also has drawers and a double door that opens to the shelves inside . Hot pepper adds spice in Burning . 2002 , an inspired love seat with chili pepper legs and arms that is the most complex object in the exhibition . The back of the seat combines peas , asparagus and flames of fire . The vegetables ' supra-realism contrasts with Janet Taylor 's abstract patterned fabric covering the seat . Another " salad " is presented in four Celery Chairs , 2005 from the original set of 10 . Stalks are the back legs for each chair , with different combinations of carrots , peppers and snow peas for the front legs and backs . Here , the intense realism of Burning is simplified and idealized , though the work is less colorful . A delicate , almost rest rained approach is evident in Onion Blossom Table , 2002 , its graceful green legs ending in small , unopened buds that recall the lines of Queen Anne furniture . Insight into Nutt 's working methods is provided by pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged flying-object sculptures , vegetables become missiles , reminders of the artist 's childhood in Huntsville , Alabama , a rocket research center during the cold war . These intriguing stationary objects are also kinetic and will turn in the wind like whirligigs . We WiIi Never Use Food as Weapon : Carrot Bomb , 1989 , inspired by a statement made by President George H. W. Bush , consists of a horizontal carrot with a propeller and fins atop a rocket about to lift off in a cloud of smoke . Intercontinental Ballistic Zucchini , 1988 , is a variation on the theme ; this time the exhaust of the rocket is the zucchini blossom .

His art skillfully combines several qualities : a love of the well-made wood object , a political sensibility and a sly humor that never eclipses the seriousness of his craft . - KAY KOENINGER Photograph ABOVE AND BELOW : Burning , 2002 , oil paint and lacquer on wood , 46 by 57 by 31 inches ; Nine Carrot Treasure Chest , 2001 , walnut , curly maple , oil paint on turned and carved wood , 94 by 20 by 20 inches .
