ANTHRAX BREAK Investigators discovered anthrax on a letter at a Seymour , Conn. , residence one mile from the Oxford home of Ottilie Lundgren , the 94-year-old woman who died two weeks ago of anthrax . CLUES The letter bore the same N.J. postmark as did those sent to Senators Daschle and Leahy in Washington , and the letters appear to have moved through the same sorting machine within seconds of one another . NEXT STEP Officials suggest that cross-contamination of mail could explain Lundgren 's fatal infection and hope to find similarities between her case and that of the Bronx woman who died in late October .
