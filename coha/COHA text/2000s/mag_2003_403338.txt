Freeride meets Weight Watchers in these strong , comfortable , surefooted full-suspension bikes . The mountain bike market is as segmented as a millipede . New niches are continually appearing to fill ever-narrower gaps between existing niches . The Foes FXR and the Cannondale Gemini 1000 occupy one of the newest slots , which we call Freeride Lite . On one side of FL are freeride bikes-heavy-duty , long-travel , full-suspension bikes designed primarily for riding downhill and jumping big . Because of their weight ( 35-plus pounds ) and relaxed geometry , these bikes have slower handling and do not climb gracefully . On the other side of FL resides the garden-variety full-suspension mountain bike , featuring a moderate amount of travel ( 3.5 to 4.5 inches ) , weighing 24 to 30 pounds , designed for both climbing and descending , and built on middle-of-the-road geometry . FL is defined by machines that look like freeride bikes on a Weight Watchers program . They have a freeride look , but they 're built up with lighter XC components . They usually feature a single-crown , 5-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . Weight varies from 29 to 35 pounds . FL bikes offer an upright riding position and mellow handling , and are surefooted and comfortable . They do n't go uphill in any particular hurry because they 're heavy and their geometry is n't suited to climbing . Riders who will most easily find happiness on one of these bikes consider climbing an unavoidable evil and love descents or rough , rocky , techni-cal trails . An FL bike will also appeal to less-skilled riders who do n't care how long a climb takes and are looking for fun out in the wild . Clydesdales will find these bikes a good choice because of the stiffness and strength . If we 're talking about you , check out these two bikes , both FL superstars . Cannondale Gemini 1000 The Gemini 1000 is a perfect example of FL . The double-triangle front end boosts both the frame 's strength and standover clearance . The single-pivot rear end looks as if it could be a major structural element of the Golden Gate Bridge . Three travel positions let you choose 5.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a burly frame , but it 's also relatively light . A lighter Fox air shock , used in place of a coil-over shock , features a remote that lets you lock out the rear end by flipping a bar-mounted lever . There 's a 5-inch Cannondale Lefty fork up front . The rest of the components would n't be out of place on an XC bike , except the fat , though reasonably light , 2.5-inch WTB tires . The Syntace VRO bar and stem combo looks odd but is stiff and lets you adjust the stem length in minute increments to dial in your sweet spot . The Magura Marta brakes are among the lightest on the market , and our favorite from the company . We had the rear brake serviced by Magura during a tech seminar , and it performed excellently . The front was inconsistent , however ; in our experience , Maguras need to be serviced by a mechanic familiar with their nuances to get consistent performance . We found the freeride-oriented Gemini a surprisingly good cross-country bike . It climbs with remarkable efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single-pivot 's twin gremlins of bob and pedal feedback , nor the overall weight of the bike . Thumb the lockout to stop the bob , but without suspension , you lose the benefits of traction and comfort . The copious travel makes the Gemini a comfortable ride . It performs best in its middle or short position ; in the longest travel setting , the rear bottoms out easily . The funny-looking Lefty fork is much improved thanks to internals from Manitou ; it provides a controlled ride and steers accurately . Foes FXR Foes is a small California frame shop long at the forefront of mountain bike technology , and its FXR is no exception . Originally designed for off-road truck racing , the FXR 's Curnutt shock can be tuned to reduce or eliminate unwanted suspension movement . It 's difficult for a shock to achieve both an efficient pedaling feel and quality suspension action , but the magic of the Curnutt is that it can tune out the bob with only a minimal effect on the bike 's small-bump compliance . What 's more , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can be applied to any suspension bike , though you can find Curnutt shocks only on Foes bikes . ( Similar technology can be found on other bikes equipped with Manitou SPV shocks and Progressive Suspension 5th Element shocks . ) The Curnutt allows Foes to build a simple suspension design with up to 5.75 inch-es of travel that 's virtually bob-free on climbs . The shock does n't hide the bike 's weight , but it makes the FXR far more pleasant to climb with . It 's not all perfection . The Curnutt does n't have the same plush and supple small-bump compliance of a standard Fox shock , and it transfers more feedback to the rider . Testers said the Curnutt has a Porsche ride compared to the Fox 's Cadillac . If you want the Caddy , order the FXR with a Fox shock . And the FXR is n't cheap ; the company produces a limited number of its beautifully rendered frames-Foes sweats little details , and quality is its religion . Foes does n't sell complete bikes , so it 's up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the package . Sidebar <p>
