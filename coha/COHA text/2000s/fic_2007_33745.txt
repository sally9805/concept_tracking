Part One : September-December 1953 In the era of security clearances to be an Irish Catholic became prima facie evidence of loyalty . Harvard men were to be checked ; Fordham men would do the checking . - DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN Chapter One : September 28 , 1953 Tim counted four big fans whirring atop their stanchions in the newsroom . Every window here on the seventh floor was open , and summer had officially departed six days ago , but that was Washington for you . When air-conditioning might come to the Star seemed to be a perennial matter of sad-sack speculation among the staff : " When hell freezes over , " went one answer Tim had heard in his three months here . " Because then we wo n't need it . " Miss McGrory , one of the paper 's book reviewers , arrived with a bottle of whiskey , which she set down next to the punch bowl and cake , whose single chocolate layer and frosted inscription , " Happy Trails , Sheriff , " would soon be cut into by the retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressman who 'd been at the Star since 1912 and took his nickname from a weekend job he had as a constable over in Berwyn Heights . More people drifted in . " We could use a piano , " opined Miss Eversman , themusic critic . She 'd covered Liberace 's concert two nights ago at Constitution Hall and was telling a police reporter that the pianist 's mother had been in the president 's box with one of Liberace 's brothers , Rudy , who 'd served in Korea . " So she 's got one boy who 's a soldier ? " asked the reporter . " Maybe she 's got hope of grandchildren after all . " Miss Eversman laughed . " Forget Liberace , " said Mr. Yost , who 'd started to reminisce about his first years here at the paper . " I remember seeing Wilson himself-that 's Woodrow Wilson , not Charlie , to you youngsters-up in his box at Keith 's Theatre . You would n't have figured it from an egghead like him , but did that man ever love his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute it came out . " " We really do need a piano , " Miss Eversman sighed , as the national and managing editors walked in . Mr. Corn and Mr. Noyes took up positions off to the side of things and remarked to each other , a bit shamefacedly , on the smallness of the spread . " Well , " said Mr. Corn , quoting the late Senator Taft 's famously impolitic advice about higher food prices : " Eat less . " The party was making Tim feel nostalgic , and thus a bit foolish , since he 'd been , after all , only a summer hire allowed to stay on through September-or , more exactly , this coming Friday afternoon . They 'd put him in the city room , even though he 'd never been to Washington before June and knew nothing about the District as a place where many citizens lived life quite oblivious to the federal government . His placement , he 'd come to understand , was typical of the Star , a paper both venerable and feckless , produced each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had liked it here and would miss the place , but given the shortness of his tenure he was n't sure he should even take a piece of the cake once it got cut . A small stack of the paper 's early edition lay atop an open drawer of the file cabinet he was leaning against . Ambassador Bohlen was flying home from Moscow to talk with Secretary Dulles , and this morning Louis Budenz , a Fordham professor and former red , had testified to the McCarthy committee that , in his " humble opinion , " parts of an Army-commissioned pamphlet about Siberia-something put together to educate the Far Eastern Command-contained large chunks of Soviet-sympathizing stuff that had been taken , without footnotes or refutation , from Communist writers . Cecil Holland , the reporter who 'd written the Budenz story , now saw Tim reading it and asked , " Laughlin , you just graduated from Fordham , did n't you ? Ever study with this guy who says the army 's been indoctrinating itself ? " Tim smiled . " I had somebody else for Economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I got a C-plus . " Holland laughed and walked over to claim a piece of the cake that had finally been sliced . At Fordham , Tim had mostly studied American history and English literature , and his plan in coming to Washington remained , even now , to combine his major and minor into a job writing for a politician , though throughout the city 's hot , depopulated summer he 'd made little headway finding anything on Capitol Hill . Well , he 'd have plenty of time and motivation come Friday afternoon ! The party conversation had turned to Senator McCarthy 's imminent wedding . " What kind of guy picks lunch hour on Tuesday to get married in a church ? " asked the financial-page editor . " A guy who 's busy taking over the world , " answered Cecil Holland . " That 's why he 's marrying a girl on his staff , " added the police reporter . " Maximum efficiency . She 'll be able to crank out the press release for Joe 's firstborn as soon as she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I hear , " said Miss Eversman , " McCarthy 's mother might be more surprised by all this than Liberace 's . " Everyone had heard the rumors . Would the president show up for the wedding ? People began to take bets . Ike 's contempt for McCarthy was by now well developed , but it would be hard , some argued , for him not to put in an appearance , now that he was back from vacation , and with St. Matthew 's being only a few blocks from the White House . Miss McGrory , who appeared to regard this talk of McCarthy on the order of a frog in the punch bowl , returned to an earlier subject and insisted that they did n't need a piano . She patted Mr. Yost 's arm and dared him to get everybody started singing " Oh , You Beautiful Doll " - Woodrow Wilson 's absolute all-time favorite , the retiring pressman had reminded them . Tim , who had been to all the West Side weddings of his uncountable cousins , right away felt Irish instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yost and Miss McGrory got things going , and within a moment , even as he remained alone with his thoughts , was singing the same words as everyone else : Let me put my arms about you , I do n't want to live without you . His job at the Star had come through the nephew of an old pal of his dad 's from Manhattan Criminal Court , where Paul Laughlin had worked during what everyone in the family now called the old days-the ones before Mr. Laughlin , nearing forty , put himself through LaSalle , by correspondence and then at night , completing his transformation from process server into accountant , making possible his family 's move from Hell 's Kitchen to the unimaginably big and bright new rooms of Stuyvesant Town . Those rooms seemed even larger now that Tim 's older sister , Frances , the Laughlins ' only other child , had gone off to Staten Island to live with her husband . If you ever leave me , how my heart would ache , I want to hug you but I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the partygoers ' eyes were on him . His pleasing tenor voice-a surprise to those who 'd heard only his soft , polite speech with its occasional stammer-had risen above everyone else 's in volume , though to anybody paying attention to the lyric , it seemed far more likely that any hugging to involve this five-foot-seven , 130-pound young man would result in his breakage , not the girl 's . Realizing what had provoked the attention and smiles , Tim blushed and lowered his voice , while everybody else raised theirs for the song 's big finish : Oh , oh , oh , oh , Oh , you beautiful doll ! Mr. Yost led the revelers ' applause for themselves , and when it subsided , Mr. Brogan , Tim 's boss on the city desk , announced : " It 's clear to me that we kept too much of Laughlin 's light under a bushel this summer . I wish we 'd had more for you to do , Timmy . " Tim smiled and thanked him . Since June he 'd mostly typed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuns to the fitfully produced copy of the oldest city reporters , who teased him about being a college man , and about a pretty girl named Helen , another summer hire who answered a phone in Classifieds and sometimes stopped to chat at his desk . They might have kept on teasing him now , but they did n't really know enough about this conscientious , if cheerful , boy , and so the spotlight soon moved elsewhere . Tim shrank back into himself as Cecil Holland redirected the conversation to-what else ? - the senator from Wisconsin . What would McCarthy do next ? people wanted to know . Holland advised them to watch what was going on up in New York : Cohn had been running subcommittee meetings there , taking testimony in closed sessions when he was n't snooping around Fort Monmouth over in Jersey . You watch : McCarthy would soon be taking shots at the army for whatever security breaches he could discover or invent . " I 'm gon na love you , like nobody 's loved you , come Cohn or come Schine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from last spring , when McCarthy staffers Roy Cohn and David Schine , colleagues and pals ( some people said more ) , had gone on their tour of USIA libraries in Europe , ridding the shelves of anti-American books by Ameri- can authors . No one ever talked half so much about Eisenhower as they did about McCarthy , Tim reflected ; the senator was as constantly on people 's lips as FDR had been when he was a boy , even if the only other thing Roosevelt and McCarthy might have in common was the admiration of Tim 's father . Paul Laughlin still revered FDR ( Mrs. R was now another story ) , as he had since the First Hundred Days . Before the arrival of the New Deal , already the father of two babies , Mr. Laughlin had spent plenty of afternoons playing stickball on the pavements of the West Fifties , unable to scare up any work pushing dress racks or plastering or even delivering groceries to widows in their Ninth Avenue walkups . But by the end of ' 33 , Paul Laughlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest man in the CCC , " upstate for weeks at a time , cutting down trees or planting new ones for what was at least half a living wage . Some kindhearted supervisor took notice of his hard work and referred him to a pal in the courts , where he worked his way up toward something like security and , at last , the cessation of sleepless nights . Nothing-not even Grandma Gaffney 's cutlery-tapping recaps of every Father Coughlin broadcast-had ever put Mr. Laughlin off Roosevelt . He remained true to the president 's memory even when the war ended and the accounting money started coming in and he began bringing the Journal-American instead of the Post home to Stuy Town , which he eventually took to reminding them had been built by a private insurance company , not as a government project . By the time Tim was finishing high school , he 'd gotten used to hearing his father say that Bishop Sheen-fine anti-red that he might be-nonetheless had a foolish sympathy for some of the labor unions . And a couple of years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dean Acheson could not come on it without Mr. Laughlin announcing , in sarcastic imitation : " I will not turn my back on Alger Hiss . " The line always made Tim and Frances laugh , as if Acheson were not a person but a corporation with a trademark pledge , like " Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco . " But for all that , Tim saw no reason why his father-the mildest of Cold Warriors , really , looking eastward not so much for invading Soviets as for the house he now hoped to buy in Nassau County-was n't right about the fundamentals of politics . Mr. Brogan , Tim now noticed , had been buttonholed by Betty Beale , one of the society reporters . " Miss Canby is n't pulling her weight ? " asked Brogan , laughing . " You shock me , Miss Beale . " " Joke if you want , " said the reporter , to whom the women's-page editor was a constant thorn in the side . Miss Beale took her own work seriously and made a point of actually going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone call to the hostess to ask what cabinet wife had " poured " for which white-gloved ladies in attendance . " I can not do this wedding alone , " she now told Mr. Brogan . " We need more than one piece out of it-something for tomorrow 's edition , something for the next day , and something for my weekend column . You know , Mr. Brogan , tonight McCarthy and his fiance are having a buffet supper at some friend 's farm out in Maryland , and thanks to Miss Canby there will be no one present from the Star . " The city editor continued listening as Miss Beale thrust home . " It 's McCarthy , Mr. Brogan . It may be just a wedding , but surely this spills into your bailiwick-and even Mr. Corn 's . May I please get a little help ? " Brogan looked around thoughtfully , until he spotted Tim , still standing against the filing cabinet . " How about making use of this fine fellow , Miss Beale ? He can spell , he 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely he can get the goods on an Irish wedding . " " How about it , cookie ? " Miss Beale asked Tim . " Do you think you can get the names of the people in as many pews as possible ? And get as many quotes as they 're willing to sling along with the rice ? The reception 's at the Washington Club right afterward . You can go to that , too . " Tim moved away from the filing cabinet and said sure . It was the only word he 'd ever spoken to the still youthful but formidable Miss Beale . " Good , then , " said Brogan , having settled the matter . " Better than good , " said Cecil Holland , who 'd overheard the exchange . " If Laughlin ever gets hauled in and investigated for anything , he can always say , But , Joe , I was at your wedding , for God 's sake ! ' " The bottle Miss McGrory had brought in was by now pretty well drained , and a sizable body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Ebbitt Grill over on F Street . Tim 's momentary celebrity earned him an invitation to join the group , but he decided he 'd be better off boning up for this opportunity he 'd just been given , however late in the game it had come . And so within ten minutes he was on his way home with someone 's copy of the Congressional Directory , the deluxe edition with photographs . He could study the pictures tonight and increase the percentage of guests he 'd recognize . Passing the Old Post Office on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue , he was reminded that he 'd yet to mail home the letter he 'd been carrying around for the past two days . In it he made his job prospects sound a lot rosier than they actually were-but then again , who knew ? Maybe this assignment was a portent of better things that might be coming once he left the paper and got back to passing out his rsum , this time in earnest , on Capitol Hill . Should he go up to Hecht 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frayed on the only laundered one he had left . No , too expensive , he decided ; he would settle for getting his shoes shined at Union Station tonight . Walking along Fifth Street , above Indiana and D , he continued on his career-conscious train of thought , contemplating the signs for lawyers and bondsmen , knowing that the former profession was still too much to aspire to , even if the latter one , like process-serving , now resided in a realm his father had lifted the Laughlins permanently above . He bought a pint of milk and a sandwich before reaching his room on the Hill , in the two-hundred block of Pennsylvania , one flight above a hardware store . His occupancy was illegal , the lower floors of the building being zoned only for offices , but a landlady with no vacancies a couple of blocks away had tipped him off to the nice Italian owner here , who told him he could have the room cheap and not to worry . It came with a hot plate and tiny icebox , and a hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim always made sure to keep the radio low ; he clicked it on now and waited for the tubes to warm up while he poured his glass of milk . A promo for One Man 's Family became audible as he sat down and began to drink . The job ads from Sunday 's paper were on the table , and for a few minutes he gave them a second , mostly hopeless , look . The " Situations Wanted " had a hierarchy as discernible as the legal pecking order on Fifth Street . YOUNG MAN , COLORED , desires evening or night work of any kind . Phone LI 8-5198 . After three months down here , the " colored " had ceased to shock ; it was the " work of any kind " that now arrested his attention and made him wonder how many weeks might be left before he 'd have to consider putting that phrase into an ad of his own . YOUNG MAN , college education , desires a responsible position . Call WO 6-8202 . Pretty vague , to say the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have , it pretty much matched his own circumstances . He certainly could n't compete with the ad just above it : YOUNG MAN , 27 , B.A. , Yale , 3 years experience legislative research . 3 yrs . formal legal training , desires position with trade assoc. or law office . Box 61-V . Star . He wondered if Helen had taken any of these down over the phone . Setting the paper aside in favor of the Congressional Directory , he decided to put a ruler over the names beneath the pictures . He would see if he could correctly distinguish , say , Prescott Bush ( R-Connecticut ) from Bourke Hickenlooper ( R-Iowa ) . At least he was familiar with his assignment 's location , having gone to St. Matthew 's last month on the Feast of the Assumption . He wished he 'd done more sightseeing this summer , or just spent a little less time in this room . He had gone to wait outside St. John 's Church one Sunday morning in June , hoping to catch a glimpse of Eisenhower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town . Everyone waiting by the church had had to settle for watching a small group demonstrate against the Rosenbergs ' execution . There had also been an evening , back in July , when the second-string theater critic had comped him to a production of Major Barbara . They 'd gone to see it together , and afterward the man had bought him a drink at the Hotel Washington 's rooftop bar , then walked him all the way home and given him a funny little hug , which he somehow had n't minded , even though the man was old enough to be his father and did n't really live , as he 'd claimed , on Capitol Hill . Excited about tomorrow , but a little restless after half an hour with the Directory , Tim thought he 'd like to go out to a movie , but he 'd been to see The Robe just last night , a quasi-religious act he 'd used , pretty Jesuitically , as an excuse not to go to church this morning . He realized now that Miss Beale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just a short ceremony or a whole Mass . If it was the latter , he 'd have a legitimate excuse to sleep a little later tomorrow instead of starting his day at the seven o'clock inside St. Peter 's on Second Street . Actually , he 'd better go to St. Pete 's either way . Even if it did turn out to be a Mass at St. Matthew 's , he 'd be too busy taking notes to line up for the Communion rail .
