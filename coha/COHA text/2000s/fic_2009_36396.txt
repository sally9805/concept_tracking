... Bengal , India , June 1870 <br> Neither of the young mounted policemen fancied these subdivisions of the Bagirhaut province . Neither of them fancied jungles where all manner of things could happen unprovoked , unseen , as they had a few years before when a poor lieutenant was stripped , clubbed , and drowned in the river for trying to collect licensing taxes . <br> The officers clamped the heels of their boots tighter into their horses ' flanks . Not to say they were scared  --  only careful . <br> " You must be careful always , " said Turner to Mason as they ducked the low branches and vines . " Be assured , the natives in India do not value life . Not even as the poorest Englishman does . " <br> The younger of the two policemen , Mason , nodded thoughtfully at the words of his impressive partner , who was nearly twenty-five years old , who had two brothers also come from England to be in Indian Civil Service , and who had fought the Indian rebellion a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " Perhaps we should have come with more men , sir . " <br> " Well , that 's pretty ! More men , Mason ? We sha n't need any more than our two heads between us to take in a few ragged dacoits . Remember , a high-mettled horse stands not for hedge nor ditch . " <br> When Mason had arrived in Bengal from Liverpool for his new post , he accepted Turner 's offer to " chum , " pooling incomes and living expenses and passing their free time in billiards or croquet . Mason , at eighteen , was thankful for counsel from such an experienced man in the ranks of the Bengal police . Turner could list places a policeman ought never to ride alone because of the Coles , the Santhals , the Assamee , the Kookies , and the hill tribes in the frontiers . Some of the criminal gangs among the tribes were dacoits , thieves ; others , warned Turner , carried axes and wanted English heads . " The natives of India value life only as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner proverb . <br> Fortunately , they were not hunting out that sort of bloodthirsty gang in these wasting temperatures this morning . Instead they were investigating a plain , brazen robbery . The day before , a long train of twenty or thirty bullock carts had been hit with a shower of stones and rocks . In the chaos , dacoits holding torches tipped over the carts and fled with valuable chests from the convoy . When intelligence of the theft reached the police station , Turner had gone to their supervisor 's desk to volunteer himself and Mason , and their commander had sent them to question a known receiver of stolen goods . <br> Now , as the terrain thinned , they neared the small thatched house on the creek . A dwindling column of smoke hovered above the mud chimney . Mason gripped the sword at his belt . Every two men in the Bengal police were assigned one sword and one light carbine rifle , and Turner had naturally claimed the rifle . <br> " Mason , " he said with a slight smile in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " You are green , are n't you ? It is highly likely they have unloaded the goods and fled already . Perhaps for the mountains , where our elaka  --  that is like ' jurisdiction , ' Mason  --  where our elaka does not extend . No matter , really , when captured , they lie and say they are innocent peasants until the corrupt darkie magistrates release them . What do you say to going tiger shooting upon some elephants ? " <br> " Turner ! " Mason whispered , just then , interrupting his partner . <br> They were coming upon the thatched-roof house where a bright red horse was tied to a post ( the natives in these provinces often painted their horses unnatural colors ) . A slight rustle at the house drew their eyes to a pair of men fitting the description of two of the thieves . One of them held a torch . They were arguing . <br> Turner signaled Mason to stay quiet . " The one on the right , it 's Narain , " he whispered and pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts at conviction had failed . <br> The opium poppy was cultivated in Bengal and refined there under English control , after which the colonial government sold the drug at auction to opium traders from England , America , and other nations . From there , the traders would transport the opium for sale to China , where it was illegal but still in great demand . The trade was enormously profitable for the British government . <br> Dismounting , Turner and Mason split up and approached the thieves from two sides . As Mason crept through the bushes from around the back , he could not help but think about their good fortune : not only that two of the thieves were still at the suspected ? confederate 's house but also that their argument was serving as distraction . <br> As Mason made his way around the thick shrubbery he jumped out at Turner 's signal and displayed his sword at the surprised Narain , who put up two trembling hands and lay flat on the ground . Meanwhile the other thief had pushed Turner down and dashed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed his rifle , and shot . He fired a wild second shot into the jungle . <br> They tied the prisoner and traced the fugitive 's path but soon lost the trail . While searching up and down the curve of the rough creek , Turner lunged at something on the ground . Upon reaching the spot , Mason saw with great pride in his chum that Turner had bludgeoned a cobra with his carbine . But the cobra was not dead and it rose up again as Mason approached and tried to strike . Such was the peril of the Bengalee jungle . <br> Abandoning the hunt for the other thief , they returned to the spot where they 'd left Narain tied to a tree and freed him , leading him as they took the horses they 'd borrowed back to the police outpost . There , they boarded the train with their prisoner in tow to bring Narain to the district of their station house . <br> " Get some sleep , " Turner said to Mason with a brotherly care . " You look worn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , Turner , " said Mason gratefully . <br> The eventful morning had been exhausting . Mason found an empty row of seats and covered his face with his hat . Before long he fell into a deep sleep beneath the rattling window , where a slow breeze made the compartment nearly tolerable . He woke to a horrible echoing scream  --  the kind that lived sometimes in his nightmares of Bengal 's jungles . <br> When he shook himself into sensibility he saw Turner standing alone staring out the window . <br> " Where 's the prisoner ? " Mason cried . <br> " I do n't know ! " Turner shouted , a wild glint in his eyes . " I looked the other way for a moment , and Narain must have thrown himself out the window ! " <br> They pulled the alarm for the train to stop . Mason and Turner , with the help of an Indian railway policeman , searched along the rocks and found Narain 's crushed and bloody body . His head had been smashed open at impact . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mason and Turner abandoned the body and reboarded the train . The young English officers were silent the remaining train ride to the station house , except for some unmusical humming by Turner . They had almost reached the terminal when Turner posed a question . <br> " Answer me this , Mason . Why did you enroll in the mounted police ? " <br> Mason tried to think of a good answer but was too troubled . " To raise a little dust , I suppose . We all want to make some noise in the world . " <br> " Stuff ! " said Turner . " Never lose sight of the true blessings of public service . Each one of us is here to turn out a better civilization in the end , and for that reason alone . " <br> " Turner , about what happened today . . . " The younger man 's face was white . <br> " What 's wrong ? " Turner demanded . " Luck was with us . That cobra might have done us both in .

Guilty , you meant . Never mind , Mason . We 'll send one of the native men . " <br> " But , wo n't we , if Dickens , I mean . . . " <br> " What mumbling ! You ought n't chew your words . " <br> " Sir , " the younger officer enunciated forcefully , " considering for a moment Dickens  --  " <br> " Mason , that 's enough ! Ca n't you see I 'm tired ? " Turner hissed . <br> " Sir , " Mason said , nodding . <br> Turner 's neck had become stiff and veiny at the sound of that particular name : Dickens . As though the word had been rotting deep inside him and now crawled back up his throat . <p>                 @ @ @ @
