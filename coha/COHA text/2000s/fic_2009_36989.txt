Thirty-Four 34 . <p> The dead man 's shoes spoke to Kurt long before he wore them . <p> He expected the shoes to say something , of course ; Kurt had hundreds of articles of clothing from the dearly departed , a wardrobe of wearable ghosts that fueled his existence . It was n't unusual , when browsing estate sales , to find a jacket whispering of adulterous affairs , a pair of slacks sobbing uncontrollably about financial ruin . While searching through the piles of belongings at these sales , Kurt heard the constant babble of past lies and past lives rising from the tables where the clothing lay neatly folded . <p> So he was n't surprised to find shoes with something to say . But while most of the clothing spoke to him in words , in plaintive voices tinged with desperation , these shoes spoke a single , simple image : a catfish . <p> It started as a white dot on the horizon , floating in a vast expanse of orange . But the dot moved , coming closer and closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its continual back-and-forth sweeps of the tail coming into focus . Finally , as the catfish filled the entire slate of his mind , Kurt absently set down the light-tan sweater he 'd been holding and turned his attention to the shoes . <p> The sweater had been quiet . Or maybe it had n't been . But if it said anything , its voice was drowned out by the image the shoes pushed his way . <p> A catfish . What did that mean ? <p> The scene began to loop again , and Kurt moved to touch the shoes . When he did , the image in his mind became a bit more vibrant , a bit more dimensional . <p> " Good stuff , huh ? " <p> Kurt swiveled his head in the direction of the voice , the catfish momentarily dissolving as his concentration broke . A short man stood next to him , riffling through the folded clothes of lot 159 ; a scruffy beard concealed most of his face . <p> " Sorry , " Kurt said , trying to force a smile into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The bearded guy picked up the tan sweater Kurt had just been holding , examined it a few moments , began refolding it . He finally looked at Kurt . " Good stuff here . Guy left lots of stuff . " <p> " Oh , " Kurt said , feeling as if his mind were in a slower gear than usual . " Yeah . Sure . " <p> And even as he tried to sift through the rest of lot 159 , an assortment of clothing left by a dead man to scavengers at an estate sale , one item continued to speak to him . <p> The shoes . <p> Sending him the flickering scenes of the catfish , swimming against the murky current of his mind . <p> thirty-nine . 39 . <p> That evening , after paying just fifty dollars for the entire lot ( the bearded guy , for all his talk about the quality of lot 159 , did n't offer a single bid ) , Kurt unlocked the rolling doors of his workshop . <p> He 'd already sealed all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage container , and now he carried the container to another door on the back wall of his workshop . He paused to unlock this door as well , then pushed it open and flipped the light switch that illuminated a single overhead bulb . <p> Cold storage . That 's what he called this room . It was the size of a single garage stall-had once been a garage stall , in fact-but it held no vehicles . Instead , giant storage bins just like the one that now held lot 159 filled the entire room , stacked floor to ceiling . <p> The room remained unheated because there was no reason to heat it . Quite the opposite , really , because cold-especially the frosty autumn and winter nights here in western Montana-fueled the fears , the ghosts , that spoke to him . The fears and ghosts that fed his work . <p> After all , not every piece of clothing was haunted by the ghost of the person who wore it . Far from it . Perhaps only one out of every twenty pieces had something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in isolation , tended to amplify the voices caught inside the folds of denim or cotton or silk or wool . <p> Kurt paused at the door , glancing up at the noticeable flicker in the bulb overhead . It swung slightly on its bare , corroded cord , rocked by a gentle breeze that was n't there . <p> From inside the plastic storage containers stacked around him , Kurt heard murmurs . Whispers . Chatters . Even a few screams . No more than a dozen distinct voices in all , out of the hundreds of articles of clothing neatly tucked away into this space . And even now , not amplified by cold storage or isolation , the shoes were projecting images of the catfish in his mind , a movie to accompany the cacophonous soundtrack of the voices . <p> He shuddered . <p> Kurt did n't want to confine ghosts of the dead in cold storage . He did n't want to hear them scream or suffer . He did n't want any of this . <p> And yet he knew this was what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to these ghosts of the present , because he could never hear the ghosts of his past-the past that stretched beyond truck driving school , beyond his therapy sessions with Todd almost eight years ago . <p> The invisible past that haunted him more than any of the ghosts ever could . <p> Fifteen 15 . <p> Kurt sat , nervously tapping his foot against the floor as he waited to meet the therapist for the first time . <p> He 'd graduate from the High Road Truck Driving School soon . Then he could apply to trucking firms all over the country , firms always searching for new drivers . He could go anywhere and start his career . Maybe eventually buy a rig of his own . <p> Eventually . <p> But right now , he was here because ... well , he 'd let the therapist decide that . That 's what therapists did , did n't they ? They listened to your secrets , nodded their heads appreciatively , and told you what was wrong with you . End of story . <p> So that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story but for the beginning of it . That was the Great Secret he was going to have to admit to the therapist , something he 'd not mentioned to any of the other students at the driving school , something he 'd not mentioned to any of the trucking firms trying to recruit him . <p> In fact , the only person who knew was Marcus , the one instructor who had become something of a friend . One night , after a few beers with Marcus , Kurt had blurted his secret confession . Slowly , hesitantly at first , but then in a torrent as Marcus listened . <p> After he 'd finished his story , Marcus had taken the last swig of his draft , nodded , looked at him , and given him the names of two people . One a private detective and the other a therapist . <p> So he 'd called the therapist . Later , he might be able to call the private detective . But not yet . <p> Kurt smiled , thinking of the incongruity of Marcus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pointed Vandyke beard , telling him about a therapist . Swigging that last drink of beer ? Yeah , Marcus looked natural doing that . But Marcus would look decidedly out of place sitting here , in this room , surrounded by soft flute music and burning incense , waiting to talk to a therapist about his past . <p> The way Kurt was waiting now . <p> The door at the back of the waiting room opened , and a pink-faced woman walked in . She stopped a moment , stared at Kurt intently , then moved quickly through the waiting room and to the door to the outside , her arms wrapped tightly against her . <p> " Mr. Marlowe ? " <p> Kurt turned his attention back to the doorway the woman had emerged from , now filled by a tall , lanky man with dirty-blond , shoulder-length hair . <p> Kurt stood . " Yeah . " <p> " You ready ? " <p> " Okay . Yeah , sure . " Kurt walked across the waiting room . The lanky man waited for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Todd Michael Greene , " he said . " Just call me Todd . " <p> Kurt stood awkwardly for a moment , then shook hands . " I 'm Kurt . " <p> Todd backed into the darkened room , swept his arm as an invitation to enter . " Have a seat . " <p> Kurt looked at the small couch . " Just sit ? " he asked . <p> Todd smiled . " Lie down , if you like . I get that a lot . " <p> Kurt moved to the sofa , sat , started tapping his foot on the floor again . <p> Todd moved to a small desk in the corner , opened a folder , and looked through it a few moments . While he read , Kurt scanned the office . Nothing expensive ; not what he 'd imagined . He 'd expected heavy furnishings of burled walnut in dark tones . Instead , he saw particle-board shelving units holding several books . At least the books had the kinds of titles he 'd expect , tomes about relationships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be drug references . <p> Todd 's desk was clean and neat , almost bare . A framed photo , turned away from Kurt , faced the office chair where Todd sat . Still reading . <p> " So Marcus recommended you ? " Todd finally asked , keeping the folder at his desk open and looking at Kurt . <p> Kurt cast his eyes toward the floor . " Yeah . " <p> " I 've known Marcus for a long time . He 's a good man . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> Todd smiled , pushed his way back from the desk , rolling on the chair 's wheels . " We 're off to a strong start . " <p> Kurt looked up again . " Yeah . " He returned the smile . <p> " Okay , you mind if I call you Kurt ? " <p> " No . I mean , sure . Call me Kurt . " <p> " You want a drink ? " He rolled the chair over to a dorm-sized refrigerator on the floor . " Afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Diet ? " Kurt asked . <p> " Sure . " <p> Todd retrieved a Diet Pepsi from the refrigerator , rolled back with it . " Ice ? " <p> " No , no , that 's good . " <p> Todd rolled back a few feet without retreating behind the desk , and watched while Kurt took his first drink . <p> " Thanks , " Kurt mumbled . He noticed his foot was tapping the hardwood floor a little too loudly and made himself stop . <p> " Nice gloves , " Todd began . <p> Kurt looked at the driving gloves on his hands . " Yeah . " <p> " Care to elaborate ? " <p> " Driving gloves . Good for ... um ... driving . " <p> Todd smiled . " But you 're not driving right now . " <p> " I guess not . " <p> " You wear them all the time ? " <p> " Pretty much . " <p> " Why 's that ? " <p> Kurt shrugged again . " They make me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with that at all . " He paused . " Tell me why you 're here , Kurt . " <p> " Well , like you said , because Marcus gave me your name . " <p> " Okay . But more than that . You 're here to talk , obviously . Maybe find some answers ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " So before we find the answers , we have to look at the questions . " <p> " Okay . " Kurt took a deep breath , raised the can of soda to his lips and drank again , then exhaled . " I ... uh ... do n't know who I am . " <p> Todd said nothing , so Kurt rushed to fill the silence . " I mean , beyond the last six months . I 'm . . . I guess you could say I have amnesia . " <p> Todd nodded thoughtfully , pushed himself up , and wrapped one leg under him . A casual pose in his OfficeMax chair . " Well , we 'll just start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Roughly . About the time I came to California , really . " <p> " And where were you before ? " <p> Kurt smiled grimly . " You tell me . " <p> " So you have no memories before ... " <p> " Before truck driving school . " <p> " What about your childhood ? Where you grew up , went to school , that kind of thing ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " But you 're able to form new memories . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Well , during your trucking school , for instance . You remember what you learned there without any problems , who you met . " <p> " Oh . Sure . " <p> Todd seemed to be considering a deep question . " I know it 's crazy , " Kurt said . " But that 's why I 'm here , huh ? " He nervously took another sip of his Diet Pepsi . " Because I 'm crazy . " <p> " I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests to start with , Kurt . But the answer to your question is : it 's not crazy at all . " He cleared his throat . " Most people have no idea who they are . " <p> Forty 40 . <p> Bright and early in the morning , Kurt opened his workshop . He 'd been plagued by dreams during the night , dreams of his old sessions with Todd . Not nightmares , really , because the sessions with Todd had never been nightmarish . But uncomfortable . Thoughts of those sessions still made something inside him twist in fear , even after seven or eight years . <p> He shook off the dust of his dreams , concentrated instead on the locked door at the back of his workshop . Instantly the shoes began transmitting the catfish bathed in orange , but Kurt ignored the image . The shoes had n't been properly amplified yet , had n't been kept in storage to distill their message . <p> Instead he focused on a woman 's thin wail emanating from a storage container on the bottom level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , then removed the lid . The smell of mothballs assaulted his nostrils . Not uncommon with clothing picked up at estate sales ; often the clothes were packed away in steamer trunks , sprinkled with ancient mothballs . <p> The wail sounded louder , unfiltered now . Kurt paused , as if gathering his energy , then began to dig through the carefully folded clothing , eventually coming to the silk dress he knew was the source of the wail . <p> He pulled the dress from the container , placed it carefully on a wall hook , took his time replacing the clothing in the receptacle , resealing it , and restacking the other containers on top . <p> All the while , the dress continued its lament , even as he gingerly picked it up , brought it into his main workshop , and set it down on a small folding table . <p> " Find my sister , " the dress whispered inside his mind between sobs . " Just find her and let her know ... I 'm ... " The voice haunting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went quiet for a few moments . <p> This whispered pleading was what he typically heard from ghost clothing : voices in search of lost loves , families longing to be reunited . <p> Kurt did n't respond . Instead he closed his eyes , letting this heartache , this sorrow , fuel his new project . He was picturing an arm rising from the ground , bony fingers outstretched as it reached for a face . <p> Yes , that seemed to capture something of the sorrow inside this dress . <p> He 'd been working on this image in his mind since first touching the dress , getting a sense of the loss inhabiting it , examining it from every angle . <p> Kurt kneeled to the concrete floor , took stock of the plates of iron stacked there , running his fingers along the rough-cut edges . He selected one large , flat piece and carried it to his workbench , then placed it in the vise and tightened the arm to hold it steady . <p> Satisfied , he retrieved his welding hood from a shelf above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the black mask tipped away from his face for now . <p> He turned to his left , opened the valve on the acetylene tank , heard the gas hiss as it raced through the tubing to the cutting tip . He picked up the igniter , held it to the torch , and sparked it . Immediately , blue flame leaped to life with a dull roar . <p> The dress , as if disturbed by the blue flame and black smoke erupting from his cutting torch , began its sobbing once again from behind him . <p> Kurt closed his eyes for a few seconds , gave his head a quick jerk to let the welder 's hood drop over his face , and opened his eyes . <p> Somewhere inside his stack , a large piece of iron would become that outstretched arm . This particular piece , he felt , contained the face . He would cut the iron , reveal the true face inside , just as the screams behind him were cutting him . <p> Revealing his own true face inside . <p> Sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time you came here , Kurt . You 're an amnesiac . " <p> Kurt looked at the floor , wishing for a Diet Pepsi from Todd 's fridge . Probably not the best time to ask for it . " Yeah , " he said , sensing that Todd was waiting for an answer of some kind . <p> At his desk , Todd picked up his file folder , now thick with papers and reports from their several sessions together . " At first I would have said hysterical amnesia , but now I do n't think so . You ever hear that term ? " <p> " No . " <p> " It 's what we call people who have been through an overwhelming emotional trauma of some kind-something that 's made them block out their past because they 're afraid to confront it . There 's no physical explanation for their amnesia , but there 's a very real emotional explanation . " <p> Kurt tapped his foot on the hard surface of the floor a few times . " But you said I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
