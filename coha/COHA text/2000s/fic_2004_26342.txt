Abarat : Days of Magic , Nights of War Part One Freaks , Fools and Fugitives Nothing After a battle lasting many ages , The Devil won , And he said to God ( who had been his Maker ) : " Lord , We are about to witness the unmaking of Creation By my hand . I would not wish you to think me cruel , So I beg you , take three things From this world before I destroy it . Three things , and then the rest will be wiped away . " God thought for a little time . And at last He said : " No , there is nothing . " The Devil was surprised . " Not even you , Lord ? " he said . And God said : " No . Not even me. "  --  From Memories of the World 's End Author unknown ( Christopher Carrion 's favorite poem ) Portrait ofGirl and Geshrat Let 's get our photograph taken , " Candy said to Malingo . They were walking down a street in Tazmagor , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Nine O'clock in the Morning . The Tazmagorian market was in full swing , and in the middle of all this buying and selling a photographer called Guumat had set up a makeshift studio . He 'd hung a crudely painted backcloth from a couple of poles and set his camera , a massive device mounted on a polished wood tripod , in front of it . His assistant , a youth who shared his father 's coxcomb hair and lightly striped blue-and-black skin , was parading a board on which examples of Guumat the Elder 's photos were pinned . " You like to be pictured by the great Guumat ? " the youth said to Malingo . " He make you look real good . " Malingo grinned . " How much ? " " Two paterzem , " said the father , gently pressing his offspring aside so as to close the sale . " For both of us ? " Candy said . " One picture , same price . Two paterzem . " " We can afford that , " Candy said to Malingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guumat asked them , glancing at them up and down . " No extra cost . " " He 's politely telling us we look like vagabonds , " Malingo said . " Well , we are vagabonds , " Candy replied . Hearing this , Guumat looked suspicious . " You can pay ? " he said . " Yes , of course , " said Candy , and dug in the pocket of her brightly patterned trousers , held up with a belt of woven biffel-reeds , and pulled out some coins , sorting through them to give Guumat the paterzem . " Good ! Good ! " he said . " Jamjam ! Get the young lady a mirror . How old are you ? " " Almost sixteen , why ? " " You wear something much more ladylike , huh ? We got nice things . Like I say , no extra charge . " " I 'm fine . Thank you . I want to remember this the way it really was . " She smiled at Malingo . " Two wanderers in Tazmagor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , that 's what I give you , " Guumat said . Jamjam handed her a little mirror and Candy consulted her reflection . She was a mess , no doubt about it . She 'd cut her hair very short a couple of weeks before so she could hide from Houlihan among some monks on Soma Plume , but the haircut had been very hurried , and it was growing out at all angles . " You look fine , " Malingo said . " So do you . Here , see for yourself . " She handed him the mirror . Her friends back in Chickentown would have thought Malingo 's face  --  with his deep orange hide and the fans of leathery skin to either side of his head  --  fit only for Halloween . But in the time they 'd been traveling together through the islands , Candy had come to love the soul inside that skin : tenderhearted and brave . Guumat arranged them in front of his camera . " You need to stand very , very still , " he instructed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture . So , now let me get the camera ready . Give me a minute or two . " " What made you want a photograph ? " Malingo said from the corner of his mouth . " Just to have . So I wo n't forget anything . " " As if , " said Malingo . " Please , " said Guumat . " Be very still . I have to focus . " Candy and Malingo were silent for a moment . " What are you thinking about ? " Malingo murmured . " Being on Yzil , at Noon . " " Oh yes . That 's something we 're sure to remember . " " Especially seeing her . . . " " The Princess Breath . " Now , without Guumat requesting it , they both fell silent for a long moment , remembering their brief encounter with the Goddess on the Noon-Day island of Yzil . Candy had seen her first : a pale , beautiful woman in red and orange standing in a patch of warm light , breathing out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said , was the means by which most of the species in the Abarat had been brought into Creation . They had been breathed out by the Creatrix , who had then let the soft wind that constantly blew through the trees and vines of Yzil claim the newborn from her arms and carry them off to the sea . " That was the most amazing  --  " " I 'm ready ! " Guumat announced from beneath the black cloth he 'd ducked under . " On the count of three we take the picture . One ! Two ! Three ! Hold it ! Do n't move ! Do n't move ! Seven seconds . " He lifted his head out from under the cloth and consulted his stopwatch . " Six . Five . Four . Three . Two . One . That 's it ! " Guumat slipped a plate into his camera to stop the exposure . " Picture taken ! Now we have to wait a few minutes while I prepare a print for you . " " No problem , " Candy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jamjam asked her . " Yes , " said Candy . " You look like you 've been on the move . " " Oh , we have , " said Malingo . " We 've seen a lot in the last few weeks , traveling around . " " I 'm jealous . I 've never left Qualm Hah . I 'd love to go adventuring . " A minute later Jamjam 's father appeared with the photograph , which was still wet . " I can sell you a very nice frame , very cheap . " " No , thanks , " said Candy . " It 's fine like this . " She and Malingo looked at the photograph . The colors were n't quite true , but Guumat caught them looking like a pair of happy tourists , with their brightly colored , rumpled clothes , so they were quite happy . Photograph in hand , they headed down the steep hill to the harbor and the ferry . " You know , I 've been thinking . . . " Candy said as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Seeing the Princess Breath made me want to learn more . About magic . " " No , Candy . " " Come on , Malingo ! Teach me .
