<p> Three women from south Montgomery County are part of a growing trend in the educational field of older students returning to the classroom . <p> The Woodlands area residents say they returned to school after so many years because it was something they wanted to do for themselves . The women all are working mothers over the age of 40 . <p> Based on the mature appearances of many classmates , they said they were n't the only older women in pursuit of further education . <p> Statistics supplied by Montgomery College support their claim . <p> In fall 2004 , 19.4 percent of students at Montgomery College were over the age of 30 , while 8.72 percent were over the age of 40 . Enrollment for fall 2004 was 7,400 . Preliminary estimates for the fall 2005 semester show 19.9 percent of students at the college are over the age of 30 , while 8.8 percent are over the age of 40 . <p> " Looking at this historically , going back to the late ' 90s , we average between 19-20 percent for students over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of college relations . " I think having 478 students over the age of 40 attending Montgomery College this past fall is significant . It says that no one is too old to come back to school for an education . " <p> Never too old <p> Scheffler said student population over the past 10 years has been 60 percent women , 40 percent men . <p> Older women heading back to school to earn a degree and launch a career is n't a novel idea . It is encouraging , however , to women who may be thinking about enrolling but who are too intimidated by age to believe they can succeed . <p> " The whole idea of going back to school scared me , " said Kathy Garcia , who 's in her early 50s , has three children ages 22 , 25 and 29 and lives in The Woodlands . " I was scared my brain would n't work . " <p> Her fears were unfounded . <p> Garcia graduated summa cum laude last December from the College of Nursing at Texas Woman 's University in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelor of science degree in nursing and is a registered nurse at St. Luke 's Community Medical Center-The Woodlands . <p> " I thought about nursing before I went to college , but my mom talked me out of it , " said Garcia , who holds a liberal arts degree from Austin College in Sherman . " She did n't really know what it was all about . Then I got married and had three children . Five or six years ago , I thought about it again but got sidetracked . It was n't a good time . " <p> Maureen Loiacano , chairwoman of Montgomery College 's mathematics and education departments , said older students bring a focus to the classroom . <p> " Because of their life experiences and study habits , older students bring a maturity into the classroom , " Loiacano said . " They already know how to multitask , and they can take care of family and study at the same time . They are good role models . " <p> Loiacano said she enjoys having older students in her classes and believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The students work together as colleagues and benefit from each other without really realizing it , " she said . " The older students have high expectations for themselves so , as teachers , we have to caution them not to place too much pressure on themselves . " <p> Change in careers <p> Garcia used to own New Attitudes hair salon with her husband Manuel Garcia and at the time was very involved with helping run the business . <p> In 2003 , Garcia decided it was time . <p> " I wanted job security and did n't want to be in the hair salon business any longer . I wanted to be a nurse . " <p> A younger salon employee and friend was applying to nursing school and Garcia thought they would be great support for each other . <p> " It was n't easy , " she said . " I had n't studied in forever and had to work hard to get into the whole routine . At times , it was overwhelming , with one of the biggest challenges being learning how to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montgomery College and North Harris College . Later , she commuted to the Texas Medical Center for classes at Texas Woman 's where she was enrolled as a full-time student . <p> " I was definitely the oldest in my class , but there were several students in their 40s who had families , " Garcia said . " I felt real comfortable . The kids ( younger students ) were sweet to me . " <p> Garcia said there was no time for cooking on weekdays and she had to let her Pilates class go . Free time did n't exist . There was always a test to study for . <p> Building confidence <p> In the end it was all worth it , she said . Along the way she discovered that her age , filled with life 's experiences , served her well and was not the obstacle she had assumed . <p> " Having graduated from nursing school gives me lots of confidence and a sense of accomplishment , " Garcia said . " It was something I did for myself . You have to be committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , though , not to have to study any more . " <p> Even so , Garcia said she enjoyed school so much that she 'll probably go for her master 's degree . <p> Unlike Garcia , who has already accomplished her goal , Pam Soden , 42 has just embarked on her career path as a nurse . <p> Soden , a Woodlands resident and mother of two children , ages 13 and 17 , declared she now knows what she wants to be when she grows up . <p> " I was interested in nursing when I went to college , but I guess I did n't have the confidence to do it , " Soden said . " Now I 'm more focused and I know what I have to do . This is something for me . My kids are older and more self-sufficient so it 's a good time to get started .

" At UT , I believe 130 applications were accepted out of 1,300 . " <p> Maintaining a high grade-point average is top priority with Soden , who said finding the time to study has n't been particularly difficult . <p> " I 'm busy all the time , but I do n't mind , " she said . " It 's weird , but I do n't know what I did before with my time . " <p> For Soden , planning for the future means doing what she 's always wanted to do . <p> " Nursing is something I can do after the kids are grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If we ever move , I can do it anywhere . It 's a whole new career and I 'm excited to get started .

" Once I finish , I 'll have to take about 30 more hours to get my CPA . " <p> Billeaud previously attended McNeese University in Lake Charles but married and left before earning a degree . <p> " I went back to school because I had to get out of minimum-wage jobs , " she said .

" It 's the first time in my life that I 'm doing something for me and not my family . It 's a real motivator . " <p> Scheffler is a frequent witness to the success of older students and said the life experiences they bring to class is what makes the college such a neat environment . <p> " It 's a vibrant thing to see the different generations working together , " he said . <p> ... <p> MATURE STUDENTS <p> Kathy Garcia , Pam Soden and Denise Billeaud - These are women over 40 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further their education and pursue a new career . <p> Kathy Garcia <p> Garcia , of Grogan 's Mill , is a registered nurse at St. Luke 's Community Medical Center-The Woodlands .
