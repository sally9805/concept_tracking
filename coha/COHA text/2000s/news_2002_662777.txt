<p> BEREA , Ohio ( AP ) - Jamir Miller will miss the entire 2002 season after tearing his right Achilles ' tendon during Cleveland 's 27-15 victory over the Minnesota Vikings on Saturday . <p> " He 's out for the year , " Browns coach Butch Davis said Sunday . " He was not hit . Nobody rolled up on the back of his leg . It just snapped and gave away . It 's one of those really unfortunate things . " <p> Davis said Miller will have surgery Monday morning , and will need 5-to-6 months to make a total recovery . <p> Losing Miller in their exhibition opener is the latest blow for the Browns , who had a rash of serious injuries last season in Davis ' first year as coach . Cleveland led the league with 16 players on injured reserve . <p> Miller was the top playmaker and leader of Cleveland 's young defense , which led the NFL with 42 takeaways and a team-record 33 interceptions in 2001 . <p> After Davis installed a defensive scheme suited to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tied for the AFC lead with 13 sacks and became the first Browns player to earn a trip to Honolulu since 1999 . <p> Expectations this season were as high for Miller as they are for the Browns . <p> " On the bus , he was clearly disappointed , " said Davis , who spoke to Miller , one of his four team captains following Saturday 's game . " He made the Pro Bowl last year and he wanted to go back . He really felt bad and you can imagine how crushed he was . " <p> Miller , who played Cleveland 's strong side , was injured as Minnesota 's Moe Williams scored on a 4-yard touchdown run in the first quarter . Davis said Miller did n't do anything unusual on the play , his tendon just snapped as he was engaging a blocker . <p> Davis said doctors told him there could have been " four or five reasons " Miller got hurt but the injury was not caused by the Metrodome 's artificial turf .

Dilfer and coach Mike Holmgren were both unavailable for comment . <p> Dilfer injured the medial collateral ligament of his right knee during the second quarter of the Seahawks ' 28-10 exhibition loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday night . <p> Playing in his third series against the Colts , Dilfer was hit by defensive tackle James Cannida and defensive end Chad Bratzke as he attempted a pass to Koren Robinson with 2:02 gone in the second quarter . <p> Dilfer was helped off the field and carted to the locker room .

" We do n't need to lose him . " <p> If Samuels were to be lost for the season , one could almost say the same about the Redskins . They are scrambling to piece together a suitable middle of the offensive line to play between Samuels and right tackle Jon Jansen , so Samuels will be asked to handle the opposition 's lead pass rusher one-on-one most of the season . <p> Had the injury been more serious , coach Steve Spurrier could have been second-guessed for leaving his starting linemen in the game well into the second quarter . Broncos <p> Injury-plagued running back Terrell Davis had an MRI exam on his swollen left knee a day after he missed the Denver Broncos ' preseason opener Saturday . <p> Results were not expected until Monday , and coach Mike Shanahan said he did n't know the severity of the injury . <p> " I have to talk to the doctors , " Shanahan said . " I 've got find out where the knee is , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore , why he could n't go , take a look at the MRI . I 've got to get a number of questions answered before I can answer you guys . " <p> Davis , who 's struggled with knee injuries the past three seasons , was scheduled to start against Chicago on Saturday , but pulled himself out just before the game because of swelling in the knee . He also had the knee drained of fluid earlier in the week . <p> " What I 'm saying is , I do n't know , " Davis said after the game . " I 'm taking a wait-and-see attitude at this time . I feel pretty upbeat . I do n't like having setbacks like this . It tends to throw me off track . " <p> Davis , the league 's MVP in 1998 after rushing for 2,008 yards , tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the fourth game of the 1999 season . <p> He played just four games the next year with left foot and ankle injuries , and played just eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buccaneers <p> Coach Jon Gruden shrugged off questions about the battle for Tampa Bay 's starting quarterback job , saying there 's no debate over who 's first , second or third . <p> But with three candidates in the running who 've led teams to the playoffs , the race could heat up Monday night when the Buccaneers open their preseason schedule against the Miami Dolphins . <p> Incumbent Brad Johnson will start and probably play a couple of series . Rob Johnson , no stranger to quarterback controversies , will go next with fourth-year pro Shaun King finishing . <p> " Brad 's our starter . I do n't know how else to put it . I 've said that from the beginning , " Gruden said . <p> At the same time , the coach makes it clear that Johnson , the former Buffalo starter signed as a free agent in March , is making strides in Gruden 's version of the West Coast offense . <p> Johnson battled injuries and inconsistency in four seasons in Buffalo , where he and Doug Flutie competed for playing time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995-97 . Bears <p> The corn fields and cow pastures of central Illinois will take some getting used to for the Chicago Bears . <p> They lost their first home exhibition game Saturday 27-3 to the Denver Broncos at their new home field in Champaign , Ill. , about 140 miles south of Chicago . The Bears are playing at the University of Illinois while Soldier Field is being renovated . <p> If the travel south was n't long enough , the Bears are staying in Decatur the night before , adding another 40 miles to the journey . <p> The hotel they were going to use in Champaign did n't have sufficient meeting space , so they moved to a newer and larger hotel in Decatur . <p> Players said the trek to Memorial Stadium was longer than expected . <p> " It 's a long bus ride , but we 'll put up with it for a season because we have to , " linebacker Brian Urlacher said .

" This is our home field , and we have to feel like we have an advantage when we play on it . " Bengals <p> The Cincinnati Bengals released offensive tackle John Jackson , the oldest player on their roster , before he could resume workouts . <p> Jackson , 37 , had an angiogram early in training camp that found nothing wrong with his heart . He had been limited to individual workouts while he healed from the procedure . <p> Jackson was the backup to Richmond Webb at left tackle last season , and slid even deeper on the depth chart after the Bengals drafted tackle Levi Jones in the first round . <p> " I think John wants to play at least one more year , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors in our decision . This will give him the opportunity to go to another football team during a time they 'll have the luxury of looking at him .

The injury was n't initially considered serious . <p> Trainer Paul Sparling said on Sunday that Spikes has partially torn a muscle and will need 2-to-4 weeks to recover fully . Steelers <p> Left tackle Wayne Gandy turned his left ankle and had to be helped off the practice field . <p> The initial diagnosis was a lateral sprain that might keep Gandy from practicing for a couple of days . <p> " We do n't think anything 's broke , " coach Bill Cowher said . " We just think he rolled his ankle over . We 'll have a better feel tomorrow . " <p> Gandy was injured on a wide run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by trainers and quarterback Kordell Stewart . <p> Cowher moved right guard Oliver Ross to left tackle to replace Gandy and inserted first-round pick Kendall Simmons at right guard .

Chargers <p> If there was a winner in round one of the San Diego Chargers ' quarterback competition , it might have been third-stringer Dave Dickenson . <p> Dickenson , who did n't take a snap as an undrafted rookie last season , was 12-of-20 for 154 yards and a touchdown in San Diego 's 24-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday night in Marty Schottenheimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no clear-cut winner between the 39-year-old Flutie and 23-year-old Brees , who entered the preseason opener for both teams considered dead-even by Schottenheimer . <p> Flutie was 6-of-9 for 46 yards while playing the first quarter . Brees was 8-of-13 for 60 yards with one interception that was n't his fault while playing most of the second quarter . Lions <p> Wide receiver Bill Schroeder sustained a " little groin pull , " and safety Corey Harris " just was n't feeling well , " forcing them to both leave midway through morning practice , coach Marty Mornhinweg said . <p> Rookie running back Luke Staley , who will have surgery on Wednesday to repair a knee ligament , said he plans to be fully recovered in six months .
