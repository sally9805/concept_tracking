Climbing a stairway to an earthly heaven , hikers make the chain-secured ascent up Angels Landing . Photograph // There are new ways of getting around Utah 's red rock paradise , and new things to see . But Zion 's autumn beauty is eternal IT 'S AUTUMN IN SOUTHWESTERN UTAH , THE SEASON WHEN VISITORS see why Utah 's Dixie is called Color Country . Up on 7,500foot-high Kolob Terrace , aspen leaves glow yellow , scrub oaks are burnished copper . Red rock canyon walls and deep , sandy washes are painted with enough flaming titian reds and glowing ambers to make a painter weep . The air is redolent with smoke and humus . Fruit ripens in the apple orchards of the Virgin River Valley . This autumn , there is plenty of news here at Utah 's Zion National Park . In Zion Canyon-the 2,000-foot-deep , watercarved sandstone canyon that forms the heart of the national park-a handsome new visitor center has been constructed from native sandstone and heavy timbers . A new shuttle service is reducing traffic jams along the canyon road by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propane-powered buses . Yet the true joys of Zion are the traditional ones : the glowing red rocks , the shimmering Virgin River , and an autumn as lovely as any in the world . Along the Virgin and its tributaries , furrowed Fremont cottonwoods tremble in their autumnal dance , raining gold leaves on hikers . Brilliant bigtooth maple , velvet ash , and box elder leaves float on mirror-smooth pools and stick to hiking boots . Science explains this transformation matter-of factly : As fall temperatures cool , trees store sugars in their roots , which in turn removes chlorophyll from their once-green leaves , revealing a multitude of underlying hues . Here , though , in a land where Ancestral Puebloans , Southern Paiute Indians , Mormon pioneers ( who gave these canyons their biblically resonant names ) , and 20th-century nature lovers have all sought sanctuary from the outside world , science often seems beside the point . To many of its visitors ; Zion is , simply , heaven on earth . " Nothing can exceed the beauty of Zion , " wrote surveyor Clarence Dutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nobility and beauty of the sculptures there is no comparison . " A climb to the lap of the gods Incomparable views and expansive natural beauty are Zion 's stock in trade . The 10-mile drive through the park on Zion-Mt . Carmel Highway , for instance , is rich with pictureperfect vistas . In northwestern Zion , the 5-mile drive from Interstate 15 to the Finger Canyons of the Kolob offers a chance to see cliffs of Navajo sandstone more dramatic than anywhere else in the park . But in my years exploring Zion , I 've learned that it rewards hikers in particular , especially in fall , when virtually any stroll is a feast for the senses . Zion Canyon offers short , easy walks along paved trails like the Pa'rus , Riverside , and Weeping Rock . For something more heart-pumping , try a day-hike up to 2,000-foot-plus view points such as Observation Point and Scout Lookout . Today I 've hiked to Hidden Canyon , a stream-cut slot canyon in upper Zion Canyon . It 's a short , steep climb-an 800-foot elevation gain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in the lap of the gods , eye to eye with ravens and hawks . Across the canyon is Angels Landing , a 1,488-foot island of sandstone connected to the Scout Lookout Trail by a slender , lh-milelong isthmus-heaven for daredevils , hell for acrophobes . Hidden Canyon Trail is an offshoot of the 11.6-mile East Rim Trail , which follows a Paiute route toward the high country to the east . The trail was improved in 1900 by second-generation Mormon rancher John Winder . " Tough as a boiled owl , " according to one account , Winder made it his mission to link Zion Canyon to the outside world . He helped young David Flanigan build his famous Cableworks atop Cable Mountain in 1906 . Later , in 1923 , Winder led highway surveyors down Pine Creek to the future site of the Zion-Mt . Carmel Tunnel , which opened to widespread acclaim in 1930 . Photograph Autumn settles on Kolob Plateau , bringing sun-softened views of Zion 's cliffs and crags .

After years of grappling with floods , heat , malaria , and isolation , those who remained were hardy , inventive , and determined people . Winder 's great-grandson now runs the Pioneer Restaurant in Springdale , and other pioneer descendants  --  with names like Crawford , Gifford , Hirschi-live here as well . With 2.5 million visitors a year , Zion is more crowded than it was in its pioneer days . But as temperatures cool , solitude is easier to find . Today , tucked into my cliffside aerie , I feel like the last person on earth . An earthy smell wafts up on the cooling evening breeze . It 's the odor of rotting logs swept by the flash-flooding Virgin River through the Zion Narrows last summer and crunched behind boulders 1,000 feet below The monsoon season is over now , the air warm and dry , but memories of Zion in flood remain . When it rains here , waterfalls pour off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks and dumps loads of sediment at each bend . This is when Zion becomes what retired park superintendent Don Falvey calls a " geological work in progress . " Beneath my perch the North Fork of the Virgin River broadly bends and disappears behind the Temple of Sinawava , a 2,400-foot-high amphitheater of rock looming over 6-mile Zion Canyon Scenic Drive . Shuttle buses run up and down the highway , dropping visitors at view points along the way A knot of walkers wanders up the trail to Weeping Rock , where springs emerge from the base of cliffs at the contact point between porous Navajo sandstone and impermeable Kayenta shale . The dripping rocks create Zion 's famous " hanging gardens " - green grottoes cushioned with lush ferns , mosses , and seasonal wildflowers . Birds come to drink here , and the crevices are populated by minuscule Zion snails , which live nowhere except in the canyon . " Water influences evetything here " I ask wildlife biologist and assistant chief of interpretation Tom Haraden ( affectionately known as Batman for his bat rescue program ) what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences everything here , " he declares . " It 's the water that makes the diversity of life and the diversity for the eye . " And what diversity ! The park 's 4,000- to 9,000-foot elevations cover everything from low-desert scrub in the canyons and mid-elevation chaparral on the cliffsides to subalpine evergreen forests on the rims . Fully 85 percent of Utah 's plant and animal species live here-some 800 plant species , 271 bird species , and 75 mammal species . The park shelters rare and rarely seen animals . On the Kolob Terrace look for the tracks of cougars on 6mile Wildcat Canyon Trail . From cliffs above the river , the peregrine falcon , the world 's fastest raptor ( capable of 100 mph ) , hunts white-throated swifts and other small birds . Caves and ledges in hard-to-reach areas protect 20 pairs of Mexican spotted owls .

Zion sits in the southern portion of the Markagunt Plateau , one of a series of high plateaus that ascends like stairs from the Grand Canyon to Bryce Canyon . Not far from Cedar Breaks National Monument , the North Fork of the Virgin River , one of the last mostly free-flowing rivers in the country , has gouged a path through nine strata dating back 260 million years .

Here , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stay . Inside the building , staffed kiosks offer backcountry permits and registration for Zion Lodge . Three short films give an overview of the park , and the large bookstore run by the Zion Natural History Association sells maps , books , and other interpretive materials . Just steps away is the transportation hub , which is also new Faced with high-season rush-hour traffic along Zion Canyon Scenic Drive , park planners decided to put visitors into shuttle buses . A second shuttle loop makes stops at businesses and lodgings in adjoining Springdale . Pulling visitors out of their cars was not an easy decision . In the early 1990s , Zion and Springdale were grappling with a number of difficult questions common to national parks and their gateway communities across the West . How do you attract visitors without spoiling the natural wonders that draw them there ? How do you preserve scenic beauty without trampling on private property rights ? One Springdale development in particular was controversial : a largescreen theater and hotel complex proposed for a site near the park entrance . The project was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Springdale residents felt the park was overstepping its authority by opposing a project outside its boundaries . Meetings grew rowdy . Eventually compromises were made and cooperation prevailed . In a gesture of goodwill , the project was scaled down . Today , Zion Canyon Giant Screen Theatre is an integral part of the new transportation plan . The National Park Service 's partner in preparing Zion and Springdale for the pressures of the 21st century is Springdale Mayor Phillip Kent Bimstein . A Chicago-born composer who fell in love with southern Utah , Bimstein moved to Springdale in 1988 and was elected mayor in 1993 . Bimstein believes his musical background was good training for his role as mayor-each involves creative collaboration . His compositions draw from the sounds of Zion Canyoncows mooing ; mating canyon tree frogs " bleating ; " rancher Garland Hirschi , now 74 , reminiscing about growing up in rural Utah ; a Kaibab Paiute family discussing their fight to halt a waste incineration plant on nearby reservation land . The elfin Bimstein uses these vocalizations as a starting point for compositions combining strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soul of Canyon Country . // " People have to take responsibility for coming up with their own solutions , " Bimstein maintains . Springdale 's solutions involve not killing the economic golden goose-the wild beauty of Zion Canyon-with inappropriate development . Inspired by Zion 's 1930s rustic " parkitecture " ( much of it constructed by earlier generations of Springdale masons ) , Springdale encourages native sandstone structures that fit the scale and natural setting and provide a visual continuity in Zion Canyon . So far , the approach is working . Springdale is attracting an increasing number of artists , entrepreneurs , and retirees . Visitors linger longer . Business is thriving . Falvey and Bimstein are frequently asked to make presentations about this successful program . But , typically neither man will take credit for anything more than laying the groundwork . Wallace Stegner wrote , " The West needs a society to match its scenery . " Bimstein agrees : " Here we are in the embrace of the land .
