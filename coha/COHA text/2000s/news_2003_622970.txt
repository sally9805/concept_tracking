<p> To see Iraq 's new elite living the fast life , go to Arasat Street . Well-dressed diners eat steak and kebabs in glittering restaurants with colonnaded porticos and marbled fountains , while shiny Land Cruisers and Corvettes glide to and from towering mansions nearby . <p> In shops down the block , snakeskin spike heels sell for $70 and a Hugo Boss overcoat goes for $150  --  many times the average Iraqi salary of $5 to $10 per month . To judge by the sometimes bizarrely written labels , many of the luxury items may be counterfeit , but who cares ? <p> Certainly not the new elite themselves , who are too busy making fortunes as smugglers , helping sneak oil out of the country and other goods in  --  ranging from cigarettes to weapons  --  in defiance of the U.N . sanctions . <p> " They steal , they cheat . A new class of unethical people are doing very well , " said Ghazwan Al-Mukhtar , a member of Iraq 's old business elite , which has fallen onhard times lately . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fellow Iraqis are living in squalor and desperation . <p> Youssef Al-Hakak stands in line at a government ration distribution center , pushing a cart with the rations of wheat , sugar , tea , cooking oil and other staples that will keep his family alive  --  " Inshallah " ( God willing ) , he says . His salary as a schoolteacher , $4 a month , would barely buy him an entree on Arasat Street . <p> It 's a tableaux that plays well with those in Washington who are pushing for regime change in Iraq  --  Saddam Hussein 's enormous palaces and the feasting of his cronies , cheek-by-jowl with the downtrodden Iraqi masses who presumably might welcome liberation by U.S. troops . <p> BROADER PICTURE <p> But the broader picture is more complex and more dysfunctional than that . <p> It 's more like Karl Marx meets Lewis Carroll , where class divisions are warped in an Alice in Wonderland funhouse . <p> A shopkeeper makes more than a heart surgeon , a taxi driver makes more in a day than a teacher makes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister . <p> " Iraq is a country that had a stable middle class before 1990 and a significant welfare state , " said Christopher Klein-Beekman , program coordinator for UNICEF 's $90 million-per-year Iraq mission . <p> " Now , all that has been liquidated , " he added . " The Western-oriented professional class has left for the United States and Canada , and the ones who stayed are driving taxis or just barely staying alive . And the smugglers are gaining . " <p> While many Western observers blame Hussein and his relatives , who they say control the smuggling and have diverted other resources for their own ends , others hold the international sanctions at least partly responsible . <p> U.N . PROHIBITIONS <p> The U.N.-run " oil-for-food " program , put into effect in 1996 , mandates that its $4.9 billion per year in oil revenues be spent on imports and explicitly prohibits spending any funds for domestically produced products or normal government expenses . As a result , the Iraqi government claims it has virtually no money for salaries to pay its clerks , school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government 's only significant cash revenues are earned from clandestine oil exports , estimated at $2 billion per year , and from equally clandestine imports . <p> No one seems to know exactly who controls this smuggling , or who owns the gaudy mansions now being constructed in rich Baghdad neighborhoods such as Arasat , Kerradeh and Mansour . And in a land where speaking ill of Hussein is a severe crime , few Iraqis care to speculate . <p> In a report released in September , however , a Washington-based nonprofit known as the Coalition for International Justice accused Hussein and his inner circle of skimming billions of dollars through illegal sales of oil , smuggling and kickbacks on the trade in oil and humanitarian goods . <p> The coalition , whose focus is monitoring human rights around the world and lobbying for war crimes tribunals , projected the rake-off at $2.5 billion for 2002  --  a sum large enough to significantly alleviate the tough conditions faced by ordinary Iraqis . <p> ENIGMATIC CONVERSATIONS <p> Iraq 's new rich themselves do n't seem to want to describe the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more enigmatic than informative . <p> At one high-fashion boutique , one dyed-blonde , spike-heeled shopper paused for small talk with a visitor while perusing fake fur coats . <p> She bemoaned the fact that the Italian and French labels of Iraq 's boom years have been replaced by knockoffs made in China , Egypt and Pakistan . <p> Her description of herself as a schoolteacher  --  a profession that pays almost nothing  --  begged the question : So are n't these goods still too expensive ? <p> She demurred silently with a smile . Then her husband , sleek in a long black leather coat , swooped in from across the store and ushered her away . <p> HUSSEIN 'S SON <p> The Bush administration and Western media reports frequently point at the president 's eldest son , Uday Hussein , who reportedly drives a Rolls-Royce Corniche , as the personification of the smuggler elite . Uday has been identified in various reports as a key figure in the illegal importation of Western cigarettes . <p> But Baghdad-based diplomats caution that there is little hard information on the subject and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government for normal expenses . <p> Members of the country 's old elite , such as Ghazwan Al-Mukhtar , say the exact identity of the new upstarts is immaterial . <p> A gaunt , elegant gentleman in his mid-50s , Al-Mukhtar spoke as he was sitting in the faded glory of the Alwiya Club , Baghdad 's leading upper-class social club since it was founded 70 years ago , when Iraq was ruled by Britain . <p> ASSETS FROZEN <p> Al-Mukhtar , a medical-products entrepreneur who studied engineering at UC Berkeley and Marquette University in Milwaukee , says all his bank accounts , amounting to millions of dollars , have been frozen in Britain since the sanctions went into effect in 1990 . <p> Now , he lives by borrowing from his brother , a lawyer in London . <p> " My daughter , who is a fifth-year medical student , wants makeup and clothes , " he says . " She needs money . I used to be able to please her just with a chocolate bar , but no longer . My son is in his fourth year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Why does n't he become a smuggler himself ? " I ca n't work under the sanctions . I work only with reputable companies , " Al-Mukhtar replies , haughtily . <p> As for the poor , the Iraqi government has tried to keep them under wraps . <p> After a spate of foreign media reports about life in Baghdad 's slums , the Information Ministry " minders " who watch over foreign reporters have barred them from visiting Saddam City , the sprawling shantytown on the city 's eastern outskirts that is home to about 2 million people . All other Baghdad slums are also off-limits . <p> But the poor  --  or newly poor  --  are easy enough to find . Bedraggled street children , mothers clutching dirty-faced babies and widows in black hejabs , or cloaks , are common sights , even though panhandling is illegal . At the city 's markets , small children are often seen scampering amid garbage piles looking for scraps of food or salvageable items . <p> SELLING THEIR BOOKS <p> Some of the most poignant scenes occur at the book fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old downtown Baghdad . Spread out on sheets are entire family libraries . <p> " This is our life , but I have no choice but to sell it , " said Jawad Al-Naimi , a government employee who was sadly watching customers pore through his collection of history books , leather-bound philosophy treatises and English-language novels  --  including two by Agatha Christie . <p> " It is our life , " he said again , slowly . <p> Abdul Al-Baghdadi , a director of the Federation of Iraqi Chambers of Commerce , said private citizens have suffered the most over the past several years . <p> " The consequences of the sanctions are heavier on the people than on the government , " said Al-Baghdadi , who owns several companies that import clothing , shoes and food . " In every country , after every war , there are people who profit . Some people here do the same . " <p> Even some top government cadres feel the personal fallout . <p> ' MY LAST FRIEND LEFT ' <p> " Just yesterday , my last friend left Iraq , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Thawra newspaper , which is run by the ruling Ba'ath Party , and an editor of several government publications . <p> " For the past 12 years , the daily aggression of the situation has caused a blackness that has isolated educated Iraqis , " she said . " Either they die , or they leave the country , or they withdraw into themselves . <p> " Our value scale has been turned upside down . Being elegantly dressed is the most important thing , because tomorrow does n't exist  --  you may die , who knows ? " <p> Al-Mufti then described her daily battles to obtain the medicine she needs for a heart problem . <p> " I ca n't hate the smugglers . The pill I put under my tongue every day , nitroglycerin , is forbidden under the U.N . sanctions , " she said , noting that the drug is also a common explosive with potential military use . " These smugglers have prolonged my life . " <p> GOVERNMENT RATIONS <p> Some observers say the sanctions have strengthened Hussein 's regime . By weakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 percent of the population depends on government rations to survive . <p> Even in candid conversations with no government officials nearby to snoop , some Iraqis blame the Americans more than the regime . <p> " One of my friends , one of Iraq 's most prominent pathologists , very well respected and very wealthy  --  he used to be wealthy , anyway  --  was recently forced to start selling his furniture and rugs and family heirlooms , " Al-Mukhtar said , shifting upright in his worn , leather Alwiya Club chair and stabbing the air with a lit cigarette . <p> " He only makes his government pension , worth a couple dollars a month , plus whatever he earns at his private clinic . This was n't caused by Saddam Hussein . <p> " So now I curse the Americans for what has happened to my friend and me , and I wait for the invasion . And I will curse them again when they come .
