The Falls A Novel The Bride " No . Please , God . Not this . " The hurt . The humiliation . The unspeakable shame . Not grief , not yet . The shock was too immediate for grief . When she discovered the enigmatic note her husband had left for her propped against a mirror in the bedroom of their honeymoon suite at the Rainbow Grand Hotel , Niagara Falls , New York , Ariah had been married twenty-one hours . When , in the early afternoon of that day , she learned from Niagara Falls police that a man resembling her husband , Gilbert Erskine , had thrown himself into the Horseshoe Falls early that morning and had been swept away  --  " vanished , so far without a trace "  --  beyond the Devil 's Hole Rapids , as the scenic attraction downriver from The Falls was named , she 'd been married not quite twenty-eight hours . These were the stark , cruel facts . " I 'm a bride who has become a widow in less than a day . " Ariah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the daughter of a much-revered Presbyterian minister , surely that should have counted for something with God , as it did with secular authorities ? Ariah struck suddenly at her face with both fists . She wanted to pummel , blacken her eyes that had seen too much . " God , help me ! You would n't be so cruel  --  would you ? " Yes . I would . Foolish woman of course I would . Who are you , to be spared My justice ? How swift the reply came ! A taunt that echoed so distinctly in Ariah 's skull , she halfway believed these pitying strangers could hear it . But here was solace : until Gilbert Erskine 's body was found in the river and identified , his death was theoretical and not official . Ariah was n't yet a widow , but still a bride . ... Waking that morning to the rude and incontrovertible fact that she who 'd slept alone all her life was yet alone again on the morning following her wedding day . Waking alone though she was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though no longer the spinster daughter of Reverend and Mrs. Thaddeus Littrell of Troy , New York , piano and voice instructor at the Troy Academy of Music , but the bride of Reverend Gilbert Erskine , recently named minister of the First Presbyterian Church of Palymra , New York . Waking alone and in that instant she knew . Yet she could not believe , her pride was too great . Not allowing herself to think I am alone . Am I ? A clamor of wedding bells had followed her here . Hundreds of miles . Her head was ringed in pain as if in a vise . Her bowels were sick as if the very intestines were corroded and rotting . In this unfamiliar bed smelling of damp linen , damp flesh and desperation . Where , where was she , what was the name of the hotel he 'd brought her to , a paradise for honeymooners , and Niagara Falls was the Honeymoon Capital of the World , a pulse in her head beat so violently she could n't think . Having been married so briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible ( Ariah was telling herself this as a frightened child might tell herself a story to ward off harm ) that Gilbert had only just slipped quietly from the bed and was in the bathroom . She lay very still listening for sounds of faucets , a bath running , a toilet flushing , hoping to hear even as her sensitive nerves resisted hearing . The awkwardness , embarrassment , shame of such intimacy was new to her , like the intimacy of marriage . The " marital bed . " Nowhere to hide . His pungent Vitalis hair-oil , and her coyly sweet Lily of the Valley cologne in collision . Just Ariah and Gilbert whom no one called Gil alone together breathless and smiling hard and determined to be cheerful , pleasant , polite with each other as they 'd always been before the wedding had joined them in holy matrimony except Ariah had to know something was wrong , she 'd been jolted from her hot stuporous sleep to this knowledge . Gone . He 's gone . Ca n't be gone . Where ? God damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world perceived her and the world was not mistaken . At the hotel registration desk she 'd signed , for the first time , Mrs. Ariah Erskine , and her cheeks had flamed . A virgin , twenty-nine years old . Inexperienced with men as with another species of being . As she lay wracked with pain she did n't dare even to reach out in the enormous bed for fear of touching him . She would n't have wanted him to misinterpret her touch . Almost , she had to recall his name . " Gilbert . " No one called him " Gil . " None of the Erskine relatives she 'd met . Possibly friends of his at the seminary in Albany had called him " Gil " but that was a side of him Ariah had n't yet seen , and could n't presume to know . It was like discussing religious faith with him : he 'd been ordained a Presbyterian minister at a very young age and so faith was his professional domain and not hers . To call such a man by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture for Ariah , his fiance who 'd only just become his wife . In his stiff shy way he 'd called her " Ariah , dear . " She called him " Gilbert " but had been planning how in a tender moment , as in a romantic Hollywood film , she would begin to call him " darling "  --  maybe even " Gil , darling . " Unless all that was changed . That possibility . She 'd had a glass of champagne at the wedding reception , and another glass  --  or two  --  of champagne in the hotel room the night before , nothing more and yet she 'd never felt so drugged , so ravaged . Her eyelashes were stuck together as if with glue , her mouth tasted of acid . She could n't bear the thought : she 'd been sleeping like this , comatose , mouth open and gaping like a fish 's . Had she been snoring ? Had Gilbert heard ? She tried to hear him in the bathroom . Antiquated plumbing shrieked and rumbled , but not close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
