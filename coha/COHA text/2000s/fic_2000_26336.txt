The Chronicles of Narnia ( adult edition ) Chapter One The Wrong Door This is a story about something that happened long ago when your grandfather was a child . It is a very important story because it shows how all the comings and goings between our own world and the land of Narnia first began . In those days Mr Sherlock Holmes was still living in Baker Street and the Bastables were looking for treasure in the Lewisham Road . In those days , if you were a boy you had to wear a stiff Eton collar every day , and schools were usually nastier than now . But meals were nicer ; and as for sweets , I wo n't tell you how cheap and good they were , because it would only make your mouth water in vain . And in those days there lived in London a girl called Polly Plummer . She lived in one of a long row of houses which were all joined together . One morning she was out in the back garden when a boy scrambled up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polly was very surprised because up till now there had never been any children in that house , but only Mr Ketterley and Miss Ketterley , a brother and sister , old bachelor and old maid , living together . So she looked up , full of curiosity . The face of the strange boy was very grubby . It could hardly have been grubbier if he had first rubbed his hands in the earth , and then had a good cry , and then dried his face with his hands . As a matter of fact , this was very nearly what he had been doing . " Hullo , " said Polly . " Hullo , " said the boy . " What 's your name ? " " Polly , " said Polly . " What 's yours ? " " Digory , " said the boy . " I say , what a funny name ! " said Polly . " It is n't half so funny as Polly , " said Digory . " Yes it is , " said Polly . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate I do wash my face , " said Polly . " Which is what you need to do ; especially after  --  " and then she stopped . She had been going to say " After you 've been blubbing , " but she thought that would n't be polite . " All right , I have then , " said Digory in a much louder voice , like a boy who was so miserable that he did n't care who knew he had been crying . " And so would you , " he went on , " if you 'd lived all your life in the country and had a pony , and a river at the bottom of the garden , and then been brought to live in a beastly Hole like this . " " London is n't a Hole , " said Polly indignantly . But the boy was too wound up to take any notice of her , and he went on  --  " And if your father was away in India  --  and you had to come and live with an Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? )  --  and if the reason was that they were looking after your Mother  --  and if your Mother as ill and was going to  --  going to  --  die . " Then his face went the wrong sort of shape as it does if you 're trying to keep back your tears . " I did n't know . I 'm sorry , " said Polly humbly . And then , because she hardly knew what to say , and also to turn Digory 's mind to cheerful subjects , she asked : " Is Mr Ketterley really mad ? " " Well , either he 's mad , " said Digory , " or there 's some other mystery . He has a study on the top floor and Aunt Letty says I must never go up there . ell , that looks fishy to begin with . And then there 's another thing . Whenever he tries to say anything to me at meal times  --  he never even tries to talk to her  --  she always shuts him up . She says , ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm sure Digory does n't want to hear about that ' , or else , ' Now , Digory , would n't you like to go out and play in the garden ? ' " " What sort of things does he try to say ? " " I do n't know . He never gets far enough . But there 's more than that . One night  --  it was last night in fact  --  as I was going past the foot of the attic stairs on my way to bed ( and I do n't much care for going past them either ) I 'm sure I heard a yell . " " Perhaps he keeps a mad wife shut up there . " " Yes , I 've thought of that . " " Or perhaps he 's a coiner . " " Or he might have been a pirate , like the man at the beginning of Treasure Island , and be always hiding from his old shipmates . " " How exciting ! " said Polly , " I never knew your house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Digory . " But you would n't like it if you had to sleep there . How would you like to lie awake listening for Uncle Andrew 's step to come creeping along the passage to your room ? And he has such awful eyes . " That was how Polly and Digory got to know one another : and as it was just the beginning of the summer holidays and neither of them was going to the sea that year , they met nearly every day . Their adventures began chiefly because it was one of the wettest and coldest summers there had been for years . That drove them to do indoor things : you might say , indoor exploration . It is wonderful how much exploring you can do with a stump of candle in a big house , or in a row of houses . Polly had discovered long ago that if you opened a certain little door in the box-room attic of her house you would find the cistern and a dark place behind it which you could get into by a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
