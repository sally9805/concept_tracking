Chapter One 63 Hours , 10 Minutes , and 40 Seconds to Go ... " The princess is here ! " - Ciara , " 1,2 Step " " There are approximately sixty-three hours , ten minutes , and forty seconds left before we are officially Del Rio Bay High Freshmen ! " Mina Mooney shouted . Mugginess saturated the air like a warm , wet , sloppy kiss gobbling up the stingy breeze floating by . Children splashed off the shore , jet skis skimmed the water 's top , and the hazy curtain of smoke rings dancing off grills draped the beach , barely shifting in the Bay 's scant breeze . Mina dabbed sweat off her satiny brown face . In defiance of the heat , she scrunched deeper beneath the beach ' brella and tried the announcement on again for good measure . " Sixty-three hours , eight minutes , and three seconds ! " A few sun worshippers stirred . They glanced her way , mildly curious . There was n't a naked space for miles on the hot sand . But no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink from the cooler . The hot beige sand prickled her knees and spilled into the body divots of her beach towel , stinging her butt as she pushed back into the shady retreat of the umbrella . Swiping dramatically at the piles of sand , she swept her towel clean until it was a sandless island once again . Mina - 1 , Sand - 0 . The hollow victory inspired another Paul Revere whoop . " Did you hear me , Liz ? ! " " It 's almost time ! " Roused by the constant wake-up call , Lizzie propped herself up on her elbows . " Mina . " She lifted her head reluctantly . " I hear you . Thanks to your declaration , every five minutes , evvveryone here has heard you ! School starts in sixty-three hours , blah , blah , blah . " She plopped down in a huff . " Now , shut up . " Mina kicked sand at her , forgetting for a second about her battle with the pesky granules . " Look , girl , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our academic careers together . Celebration is in order , like it or not ! " Lizzie popped her shades . Her green eyes , droopy with sleep , flashed with mild irritation . " First of all , stop using words like ' embark ' without a teacher around . " She frowned down at the sand stuck to her arm , wiping at it absently . " Second , only you could find joy in the first day of school , Miss JV Cheer Captain and All-Around Pop Seeker . " School was the last thing Lizzie wanted to think about . She pushed her shades down and waited for the right moment to doze off on the conversation . " You know what ? " Mina asked in one of those **34;159;TOOLONG tones . " Ya 'll will be okay once it starts and we start hitting Friday night football , watching JZ get his game on and chowing down at the Ria afterward . " Rio 's Ria was a small pizza restaurant and the place to be if you were an under eighteen DRB ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pizza was n't good , but Rio 's Ria was the spot by sheer luck . It happened to be within walking distance of Cimarra Beach , Del Rio Bay 's middle and high schools , and more than a dozen communities . " We eat at the Ria every Thursday no matter what time of year it is , " Lizzie said . " That 's hardly a reason to get excited about going back to school . And who is ' ya 'll ' ? " " Michael . I guess both of ya 'll been drinking from the same bottle of hater-ade cause he 's all bummed out about school starting , too , " Mina said , ramping up for a full-blown conversation . She 'd spent half the afternoon daydreaming , waiting for someone to gab with . Now that Lizzie was awake , it was on . " Maybe class would be more interesting if you treated it like one of your productions . " Lizzie grabbed a spray bottle and pelted her belly and neck with lukewarm water . It still felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student , " Mina reasoned . " In case you ca n't tell , I 'm rolling my eyes , " Lizzie warned . Mina tickled Lizzie 's side with her toe . " Come on , you 're excited about AP Lit . I know you are . " Lizzie giggled . " Only because we have it together . " " There ya go . I knew you could find something to get hyped about . " Having a class with Mina was one bright spot . But Lizzie refused to give Mina the satisfaction . School was not something to celebrate . " I hate that we have Lit last period . Who is awake enough for Austen and Faulkner during fourth period ? " she grumbled . " But I know you 're excited about being able to audition for ... dun-da-da-dahhhh , Bay Dra-da 's production . " Mina made her skeptical eyebrows , daring Lizzie to say otherwise . Lizzie did n't argue . The school 's Drama and Dance Troupe was the one element of school she was down for . Blond hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time she looked alert . " Of course . And if I could do it without the whole class thing , all the better . " " Yeah , well it 's a package deal . See , for me ... " " Yeah , yeah , the Uppers , the caf , yada , yada , blas-blah , " Lizzie said , spritzing her arms . " See , you brush it off like it 's nothing . But I 'm doing this for Us , " Mina said . Lizzie 's eyebrow shot up . Plotting to score a spot in the coveted caf , the beautiful people's-only section of the cafeteria , had been Mina 's obsession since summer started . It was all she talked about . Sitting in the caf with the Uppers , the high school 's social glitterati , was school to her . She did n't mind attending class to improve her social status . As she always said , if not there , where ? Lizzie did n't worry about being the It girl . Mina worried , planned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . If Mina did n't accomplish her goal-whatever the specific objective was-it would be something else she 'd obsess over until she got it . So to avoid having to hear this every day until Christmas , Lizzie was rooting for her to earn whatever spot she thought she deserved among the potpourri of kids who ran the entire school from sports to debate team . Uppers were the ruling class . They hailed from a variety of grades , backgrounds , and neighborhoods and had one thing in common : somehow they had made it to the top of their species , athlete , rich kid , smart kid . It was the mother of all cliques-the clique that decided the cliques . JZ once said the first semester of high school was like the NFL draft , where the cliques picked you and decided where you fit . Whether you cared , bought into it or not , was n't the point . Mina was caught up in her favorite conversation . " Because you know once one of us has a solid in , it 'll probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She parted her hair , putting it into two braids as she talked . Her fingers fought through the wavy roots , forcing it to behave . " I 'm figuring I have an easy in because of cheerleading . But since the last two junior varsity squads were kind of sorry , I heard the cheerleaders fell off a bit . It 's all about the Stomp Starz , now , " Mina said , referring to the high school 's hip-hop step team . She thought it over . " Maybe I should go out for step team . " " Ha ! Yeah , right . " Snorts honked from Lizzie 's nose . " Are you serious ? " " Yeah . I could do step team in the winter and cheer only for football . Why are you tripping so hard ? " " Two words , " Lizzie said , thrusting two fingers skyward . " Jessica . Johnson . " Mina groaned . She forgot all about Jessica , sophomore , newest step mistress of the Stomp Starz , and the only black female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snotty , mostly rich kids . Mostly , because Jessica was n't . Mina still wondered how Jessica got in with the glams . She lived in The Great Melting Pot-or , at least , that 's what everybody called Woodberry Ridge , the neighborhood where Jessica and Sarah lived , because a lot of the residents were immigrants . One of DRB 's oldest ' burbs and most diverse neighborhoods , The Great Melting Pot had the most inexpensive homes in the city and drew lots of workers who ran Del Rio Bay 's restaurants and retail stores . Also , a handful of teachers lived there . Yet , even coming from The Great Melting Pot , somehow Jessica had befriended Mari-Beth Linton , blond-haired , green-eyed head of the glams and all-around snot . Mari-Beth was the type of person who only made friends with people who could benefit her . All the more reason Mina never understood how Jessica fit in . But the two were the best of friends . Mina had stayed as far away from Mari-Beth as was humanly possible in middle school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid . Mina had suffered through two years of recreational squad cheerleading with Jessica and Jess ' fraternal twin sister , Sarah . The second year on the Raiders squad , when Jessica made captain , was the absolute worst season of Mina 's life . Everyone , except Sarah , called Jessica the Cheer Nazi behind her back because she was n't just bossy , she was straight nasty . She took a special dislike to Mina and whenever the coach was out of earshot , all Mina heard was : " God ! Could your herkie be any lower ? We 're going to get points off if that 's the best you can do . " " Mina , lock your knees ! " Sarah and Jess were like night and day , right down to their personalities and even looks . Cool , laid-back Sarah was the cream , light cocoa-complexioned , thick curly hair to her ears , to Jessica 's coffee-bean skin , broad nose , thick lips , and extremely straight weavealicious hair down past her shoulders . It was n't enough for Mina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand the thought of being disliked and confronted Jessica during practice one day . " Jess , did I do something wrong ? " she asked , warding off the urge to run far away from Jessica 's hostile vibes . " You do everything wrong . Maybe cheerleading is n't your thing . " Jessica pierced Mina with hazel eyes ( contacts ) that looked odd against her dark complexion . " I meant , did I say or do something to make you hate on me so much ? " Jessica craned her neck , checking on the whereabouts of the coach . " You 're just the extra black token , " she said through a phony , frozen grin . " Remember , everywhere you go , I 'll have already been there , done that . " " Meaning ? " Mina asked , not believing her ears . " Meaning , there 's not enough room for three of us on the squad . Take up soccer or something , " Jessica said before gliding off , runway model style . Mina was sick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same room as Jess and her nasty cat-colored eyes made her nauseous . Every practice after their little talk , Jessica made sure to point out some new cheerleading deficiency Mina had : high Vs not high enough , low Vs not low enough , and this one , whispered while the coach looked over her routine notes , Mina was sure Jessica had totally made up , " Your head bobble is throwing off the eight-count . " Mina never bothered trying to figure out how a small movement of her head , if she 'd even made one , could throw off a whole segment of the routine . Instead , with Jessica 's constant badgering ringing in her ears- " Mina , your motions suck . Tighten ' em up ! " - Mina turned to blogging after especially brutal practices . Teen Pop Star , her blog all about life in the popularity bubble , became her favorite boredom killer and her lifeline when Lizzie , Michael , or JZ were n't around for venting . That first year , Jessica , a proud , card-carrying member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so not club , was the star of most of Mina 's blog entries as The Bee . To protect the innocent and the not so innocent , in Jessica 's case , Mina kept the blog 's URL private and made up names for everyone , including herself , the Pop Princess . She had n't shared the blog with the clique until this summer . Lizzie laughed out loud at every entry and kept saying , " Mi , this would make a great book . " And just like that , Mina knew it would be one day , I Was a Teenage Pop Star , a secret behind-the-scenes look at life on the pop side , told by an insider . Who better to talk about the inner workings of the pop life than her ? And only Mina would know which parts of the book were real and which ones were n't . The blog/future novel was the only good thing that came out of two seasons with Hurricane Jess . Luckily , Jessica had lost interest in cheerleading as a freshman and picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " got " away , the only person to resist Mina 's girl-next-door charm and now she was the ruling black chick of Del Rio Bay High . The thought of sucking up to her to get ahead made Mina woozy . Jessica 's words echoed in Mina 's brain , " Remember , everywhere you go , I 'll have already been there , done that . " Yeah , no step squad for me , Mina thought . " Still wan na do step team ? " Lizzie asked , laughter glinting in her eyes . " Not so much , " Mina said . " But I 'm not scared of Jess . Do n't get it twisted . " " Yeah , but she 's where you wan na be . You got ta at least play nice , " Lizzie said . " I 'm more worried about impressing Kim Vaughn , the varsity cheer captain , " Mina said . She knew she could n't totally discount Jessica . If Jessica wanted to make Mina 's life hell again , it could be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity . Lizzie twisted her French braid into a fat bun at the back of her neck , then turned on to her stomach and said , " Okay , girl , change the channel . " That was their code for you 're getting on my nerves and I 'm tired of talking about this . " I plan to hold onto my forty hours and whatever minutes with a death grip . " Lizzie yawned , her words muffled as she turned her head . " Wake me on the first day of school ! " Alone again and too wired to nap , Mina plugged in her earpiece . Young Jeezy burst into her ear . She mouthed along , not bothering to censor his inappropriately irresistible lyrics and cracked open her Journal of Random Thoughts ( JORT ) , the mobile version of Teen Pop . Stretched out on her stomach , pen in hand , she closed her eyes , pushing thoughts of Jessica far away , and let the words swimming in her head form coherent sentences that described the day 's jaunt to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's portrayal of their adventures . Michael 's Academy Award-worthy performance earlier was shaping up quickly as a new chapter . The downside to being with her friends all the time had started to show that morning . She squinted against the sun 's glare until her eyes found Michael , a dark drop of chocolate on a bright orange and yellow boogie board , skin and bald head glistening . Mina half expected to see a rumbling thunder cloud over his head , the perfect symbol for his mood earlier . She and Lizzie were all of ten minutes late and Michael had a fit . He chewed them out and vowed in a snit that this was the last time he would bother showing up on time to meet them somewhere . Cue the symphony and everyone sing opera style , " Dra-maaa ! " But , also typical Michael . You knew what was on his mind , because he painted a picture for you . But even Mina had n't been able to penetrate his moods on days like today when he was an equal opportunity bitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not like she got mad over things he said to her . Well , she did n't stay mad ... long . Today , she had n't bothered to press the issue , figuring he was just tired of always hanging with her and Liz while JZ got his swerve on , talking up new girlfriend prospects . Now that she thought about it , it was JZ , anxious to scope out potential beach honeys , who had rolled out , leaving Michael to set up the umbrella and gear by his lonely . There was no such thing as late to JZ-as far as he was concerned the party did n't start until he rolled through . Michael should have fussed him out . She and Lizzie were just the easy targets . She rolled her eyes as she scribbled . JZ could get away with murder . His mega-watt smile and willingness to strike up a conversation with anyone drew people to him , especially girls . She glanced up , head checking . She did n't want anyone to even see her admit this in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet of cinnamon handsomeness complete with a ripple of tight , smooth muscles thanks to a school year spent swearing off soda , sugar , and fast food , fine . The problem was he knew it and so did a lot of girls in the DRB . Her stomach churned , fluttering at the thought of him ditching the clique for one of his girls aplenty . But she pushed the thought far away . No one 's breaking up the clique , she thought with smug satisfaction . (
