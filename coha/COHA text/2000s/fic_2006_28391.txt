Murder at The Washington Tribune By Margaret Truman Random House Margaret Truman Another speaker came to the podium . Joe Wilcox leaned close to his wife and muttered just loud enough for her pretty ears only , " Another speaker . " He shifted position in his chair and twisted his neck against a growing stiffness and full-blown boredom . With them at a front table were three couples , others from The Washington Tribune and their spouses who 'd agreed to attend the awards evening with the Wilcoxes out of friendship , or obligation , or maybe a little of both . The dinner was an annual event for the Washington Media Association , whose members came from the ranks of Washington , D.C. 's , print and broadcast journalists . Like most such groups , its leadership was fond of bestowing awards on deserving members and on their chosen profession , giving that same leadership a reason for taking to the podium to express their views on many things , mostly political . An occasional , usually accidental , bit of humor provided blessed audience relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least they 're getting to the awards , Wilcox thought as the speaker said " In conclusion " for the third time . Wilcox looked to a table at which his daughter , Roberta , sat . She was the reason Joe and Georgia were there . The speaker at the podium finally did conclude , and the bestowing of awards commenced , twenty-two in all . Three weeks later -- or so it seemed -- Roberta was the sixteenth recipient called to the podium to accept the award for Best Local Investigative Reporting -- Broadcast , accompanied by the producer and the director of a TV series they 'd done on corruption within the Washington MPD . " Does n't she look beautiful ? " Georgia said . " Of course she does , " Wilcox replied . " Because she is . " Roberta Wilcox did look stunning that evening in a stylish pantsuit the color of ripe peaches . But it was radiance from within that created a virtual aura around her , enhanced by a bright smile that had lit up the nightly news since she 'd joined the station three years earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus . She usually wore her auburn hair pulled back when on the air , but this evening she 'd let it down , framing an oval face with inquisitive raisin-brown eyes , her skin fair but not pale , her makeup tastefully underapplied . She thanked the station for having given her the freedom and support to pursue the expose , read helpful names from a slip of paper including the producer and director , and ended by crediting her parents for having instilled in her the natural curiosity necessary to get the job done . " Of course , " she added , " I come from good reportorial stock . My father is as good a reporter as there is in this city . " She watched him wince , tossed him a kiss off her fingertips , and led her fellow award winners back to their table . It was announced from the podium that the evening had come to an end , and most of the three hundred men and women left their tables to mingle , gravitating to familiar faces and offering congratulations to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ugly guy like you end up with such a knockout of a daughter ? " a Trib reporter asked Wilcox , accompanied by a laugh and a slap on the back . " Her mother 's genes , " Wilcox replied , nodding in the direction of his wife , who 'd gone to Roberta 's table to talk with her and her celebrating tablemates . " Must be , " Wilcox 's friend said . He lowered his voice . " What do you think of Hawthorne getting an award ? " Gene Hawthorne , a Trib Metro reporter , had been cited for a three-part series he 'd done on a local bank 's illegal payoffs to a district official . Wilcox shrugged , which accurately reflected what he was thinking . Hawthorne , in his late twenties , did not rank high on his list of favorite people . Wilcox was n't alone in his negative view of the abrasive , aggressive young reporter who had a penchant for rubbing colleagues the wrong way , his knife always in search of an unprotected back , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being stepped on . Equally galling was the backing he received from the Trib 's ranking editors and management , who obviously viewed the young , smug , sandy-haired , self-possessed reporter as a rising star , which , of course , he was , a bit of news that was n't lost on anyone at the Trib , Joe included . He saw in the young reporter something of himself years ago when he 'd come to The Washington Tribune , brimming with ambition and possessing the energy to fuel it . But it had been different at the paper twenty-three years ago . Then , there were still plenty of grizzled veteran reporters from whom to learn , men ( almost exclusively ) who lived the life of a reporter as portrayed in movies and plays , characters straight out of The Front Page , their heads surrounded by blue cigarette and cigar smoke , pints of whiskey in their desk drawers , the rattle and clank of their typewriters testifying to their daily output , spoken words tough and profane , written words sharp and to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger Trib reporters , including Wilcox , had been hired to supplement that veteran staff . But eventually Gene Hawthorne and dozens of men and women like him had been brought in to replace the over-fifty crowd . There had been a flurry of buyouts offered over the past few years , and many newsroom veterans had jumped at the severance package with its generous cash settlement , pension options , and health and life insurance . In came the new blood , working at half the pay of the reporters who 'd gone on to their retirement , or in many cases new jobs . One of the Trib 's top economics reporters had left on a Friday ; his byline appeared over an article in the Trib the following Monday , written for a wire service that had eagerly hired him . It just was n't the same anymore for Joe Wilcox . He was now a member of the dinosaur club himself and was viewed with a certain barely disguised scorn by Hawthorne and his cadre of young hotshots . Joe was two years from fifty-five , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd given The Washington Tribune the best twenty-five years of his life . Roberta and Georgia approached and Roberta gave him a hug . She was taller than her father . " Thanks for the plug , " he said . " I meant it , " she said . " You look great , honey . Congratulations . That was a hell of a piece you did . " " I wonder if anyone at MPD will ever congratulate me , " she said . Wilcox laughed . " I 'm sure the police are preparing a proclamation as we speak naming you honorary cop of the year . " " I know it was awkward for you , " Roberta said , her expression as serious as her words . " They 'll get over it , " he said . " I still have friends over there who agreed with you . They all suffer when a few foul balls taint the entire force . " " But if they knew you 'd fed me some of the information I used --  " " Which they wo n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anything new on Kaporis ? " she asked . His response was a shake of his head , and a tiny smile for a thought that came and went . This daughter-journalist had not asked the question out of natural curiosity . - Like her father , Roberta Wilcox had been reporting on the killing of Jean Kaporis , a young woman who 'd joined The Trib less than a year ago , fresh out of the University of Missouri 's school of journalism . Kaporis had been assigned to the paper 's " Panache " section , helping cover the city 's vibrant social scene : the weddings of those whose names were well known enough to justify coverage , fundraisers -- a day did n't pass in Washington when someone was n't raising funds for something deemed worthy of their time and effort , important or whimsical -- and ideally a scandal among the rich and famous and thin , a political faux pas , a fatuous misstep that would leave readers tittering . It was n't the sort of assignment she preferred , but she knew it represented a starting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself into it , hoping her work would capture the attention of someone in a position to move her into hard news . That kind of break had n't happened during her time at The Trib . But she had one advantage . She was lovely . Male heads turned and pulse rates sped up whenever she sauntered through the newsroom wearing skirts , sweaters , and blouses that accented her ripe body , donning a linen blazer in summer now and then as a nod to corporate correctness . No doubt about it , Jean Kaporis was a splendid example of young womanhood , every curve and bump properly placed , good genes in ample evidence , and especially a pleasant , willing personality to go with it , all of which attracted many people to her -- including whoever had strangled her to death . A maintenance man found her early one morning a month ago in a secluded second-floor supply closet at the far end of the main newsroom , bruises on her neck , pretty mouth going in the wrong direction as though someone had removed it and carelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd died from manual strangulation , her throat and larynx damaged from pressure exerted by her assailant 's hands and fingers . The presence of petechial hemorrhages in the mucous membrane lining the inner surface of her eyelids provided presumptive evidence of strangulation . She 'd bitten her tongue , a not-uncommon occurrence with victims of strangulation . The struggle with her attacker had been brief . Although laboratory analysis indicated she 'd engaged in sexual intercourse within twenty-four hours of death , there was no outward sign of having been sexually assaulted . - " No , nothing new , " he told his daughter . " They 've been questioning everyone at the paper . Makes sense . " " And ? " " No ' ands , ' Roberta . That 's all I know . Maybe you know something you 'd like to share . " She shook her head . " Let you know if anything breaks , " he said . She smiled and squeezed his arm . " And I 'll do the same . " " Back to the house for a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , Mom . I promised the guys from the station I 'd go out with them . " " Ah , youth , " Wilcox said . Wasted on the young . To his wife : " What say we call it a night ? " Georgia nodded and kissed her daughter on the cheek . " Not too late , " she said . " You need your beauty sleep . " " Mom ! " " I know , I know , but --  " " Not too late , " Joe Wilcox echoed , a wide grin crossing his craggy face . " And eat breakfast . You should always start the day with a good breakfast . Diane Sawyer does . " As the Wilcoxes and hundreds of others poured out of the Washington Hilton and Towers on to Connecticut Avenue NW , they were confronted with a chaotic crime scene . A half-dozen marked police cars , lights flashing and radios crackling , had blocked off the wide thoroughfare . Yellow crime scene tape marked an area of the sidewalk almost directly in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cloth lay on the sidewalk inside the taped-off section . " Hey , Joe ! " A colleague from a competing paper , with whom Joe had covered myriad crime scenes , came up to the couple . " What happened ? " Wilcox asked . " A drive-by . Middle-aged white guy . " " He 's dead ? " Georgia asked . " Very . " To Joe : " You covering ? " " No . Night off . This is the same spot where Hinckley shot Reagan back in eighty-one . " " That 's right , " said the reporter , making a note in his pad . " Forgot about that . " " Let 's go , " Georgia said . Wilcox took a final look at the body , shook his head , took his wife 's arm , and maneuvered through the crowd in the direction of the parking garage . As they pulled onto the street , Georgia said , " If you want to go back , Joe , I 'll drive home . You can take a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not missing anything . There 'll be another murder to cover tomorrow . There always is . No , this is Roberta 's night , and I do n't want anything to spoil the memory of her up there getting her award . Damn , she looked good . " It was , he knew , what his wife wanted to hear . She squeezed his thigh and said , " Let 's stop for ice cream . I 'm in the mood . " " Then ice cream it 'll be . "
