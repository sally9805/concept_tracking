SINCE THE HISTORY BOOKS all agreed that he was going to kill six hundred people on June 25 , 2038 , Jeremy Calder was careful to get up early that day . He had bought a new suit and gotten a haircut the day before , so he was looking pretty sharp when he left his house . The suit was a handsome dark blue wool , appropriate for funerals or causing disasters . Jeremy wore it as an act of defiance : all the pictures from the future showed him wearing a T-shirt and khakis on the big day . <p> When he went out to his car the little crowd in the parking lot began chanting slogans and waving signs at him . They 'd started trickling in during the night , a motley collection of temporazzi , present-day gawkers , protesters , and a couple of religious types . The cops had barriers up to hold them back , but Jeremy was still startled and a little shaken at how angry some of them were . A man wearing a FUTURE CALDER VICTIM T-shirt spat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but he heard a bottle thud on the roof as he started backing out . Once on the road he flipped on the radio out of habit . The Morning Crew on WRDU were talking about him . " In case you do n't know , today 's the day that Jerry Calder 's going to let loose the HNE  --  2038 virus which makes a couple of million people sick and kills - what , a thousand ? " <p> " Six hundred fifteen . " <p> " Okay , so six hundred people . The question we have for our listeners is , what would you do if you were him ? If you knew you were going to cause something like that ? The number is RDU-CREW , or email us at amcrew@rdu.com . Let 's hear what you think . Mike in Hillsborough , go ahead . " <p> " Hey , Greg , Linda , I listen to y'all every morning . Listen , if this guy knows he 's gon na cause all those deaths , why does n't he just call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't do it , man . " <p> " Does n't work that way , " said Linda . " Is n't that what all the scientists say ? You ca n't change the future any more than you can change the past . " <p> " Julie on the Beltline : talk to me , babe . " <p> " Hi , Greg ! Thanks for taking my call . I guess it makes a difference if it 's an accident or if he does it on purpose , right ? I mean , anyone can make a mistake , right ? " <p> " Even if six hundred people die from it ? " <p> " Well , I 'm not saying he should n't be punished for it , but , you know , there is a difference , right ? " <p> " You 're saying it 's a question of intent , " put in Linda . <p> " Yeah . AP <p> " Okay . Wayne in Garner , you 're talking to the Crew . Wayne ? " <p> " Hello ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't try to avoid it , he 's guilty , period . Like if you 're driving on manual and somebody walks in front of your car - if you do n't turn the wheel or hit the brakes , it 's just like murder . I do n't see why the cops ca n't just stop this guy , and the hell with the Supreme Court and the ACLU and everyone who says you ca n't arrest people before they do anything . He 's guilty , put him in jail . " <p> " Thanks , Wayne . We 've got time for one more . Ali in Durham , go ahead . " <p> " Thank you Greg and Linda for taking my call . What you have to understand is this man can not change anything so he can not be blamed . When people from the future come back to our time they are not changing things because their visit is already part of their history . I have written a book which explains how - " <p> " Okay , thanks , Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Jeremy thought about calling in himself , if only to tell them he hated being called Jerry . But he decided against it ; they 'd probably go on to something else after the commercial , so there was no sense in drawing attention to himself . He switched over to the public radio station and turned up the volume so that he 'd have a chance of understanding the mumbly announcer reading the morning news . <p> " ... death toll of approximately six hundred twenty during the next five years , according to the Center for Disease Control . Most of the victims will be elderly . Both the North Carolina Department of Health and the U.S. Public Health Service have been conducting vaccination programs since 2026 , but to date only forty percent of the people in North Carolina and less than thirty percent in neighboring states have received inoculations . According to a spokesman for the state Department of Health , the low rates are due to public apathy , since individuals who know they are not going to die from the disease are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has released future records indicating a surge in vaccinations after the release of the virus , so health authorities are making sure a large supply is on hand . " <p> Jeremy himself had gotten the shots as soon as they became available ; in his more Darwinian moods he sometimes thought HNE was a good way to weed out people too damned lazy to get a free injection . They were giving them out at the malls , for crying out loud ! He usually felt that way after some future victim sent him hate mail . <p> The car pulled off the expressway at the proper exit , and Jeremy flipped it back onto manual control for the last three blocks . Getting into the parking lot was always tricky , and today there were likely to be some extra hazards . <p> The Viverta Laboratories building in Research Triangle Park had once been a big expensive showpiece structure , designed by an award-winning architect and full of features that looked really nifty in all the trade journals even though they made life hell for the tenants . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mirrored glass , enclosing a pond with tall fountain jets . Lawns as smooth and obsessively tended as a golf course stretched down to the edge of the highway , and a line of live oaks brought in at hideous expense marked the edges of the lot . Of course , everyone who worked at Viverta parked on the vast asphalt griddle hidden behind the building , and came and went through the loading dock . The front doors behind the fountain were opened a total of six times during the entire history of the place . <p> Now the place was obsolete : all basic research was being farmed out to little scientific sweatshops in Eastern Europe and Latin America , where barely-literate techs and burned-out ABDs performed ground-breaking experiments by slavishly following instructions in the papers they themselves would write . The RTP site had been sold to a company in the mushrooming interstellar industry . The future people wanted knowledge of the universe and contact with alien civilizations , so they were willing to pay big bucks to get them launched as early as possible . Drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on developing new products , but simply manufactured futuretech medicines under license , sometimes paying royalties to their own corporate descendants . <p> The prize-winning building was slated for demolition , and the contractors had already torn up half of the parking lot while the cleanup crews closed down Viverta 's labs and disposed of any biohazards . Normally there were only half a dozen cars in what remained of the lot , but today it was packed with news vans , police cars , and people on foot . <p> The cops had prudently put up sawhorses to keep the crowd away from the door . Demonstrators were on the left , spectators and media on the right . It was hard to tell which group was more excited . The demonstrators waved signs saying . things like FUTURE HNE VICTIMS and STOP CALDER Now . One old crank with a densely-lettered sign reading " **46;1410;TOOLONG " reached into his ratty overcoat when Jeremy came in sight , but the cops had already watched the video being recorded at that moment by the media people , and were ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pettigrew met Jeremy at the loading dock . He had a serious clean fetish , which was perhaps understandable in someone who disposed of infectious material for a living . Pettigrew Associates had the contract to clean out the lab and make sure nothing dangerous was left before demolition , and Mr. Pettigrew had a team of thirty people on the job  --  mostly ex-postdocs like Jeremy eager to turn their suddenly obsolete training into gainful employment . Today he was particularly obsessive , wearing a futuretech cleansuit over his polyester knit gym teacher shirt and beltless slacks . <p> " I 've put you on cleaning out the water samples . There 's nothing contagious there . " <p> " So are you trying to keep me from releasing the virus , or is this just a way to cover your own tail ? " <p> " I 'd send you home if I could . " <p> " Ca n't do that without cause . Future knowledge does n't matter , " said Jeremy . " Chronological discrimination . Now , if you give me a day off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Pettigrew was too cheap to do that , and both of them knew it . " Why do n't you just go home ? " <p> " I thought about it , but - " he stopped , unsure of the reason himself . Finally he laughed . " I guess I did n't want to disappoint everyone . " <p> " Well , then I want you to do everything properly today . Full sterile procedure , full documentation , everything . And if you find anything strange , do n't touch it . You 're doing the Class I labs up on the third floor . Stay away from the others . I 'm going to watch you all day . " <p> " You ca n't stop it from happening , you know . " <p> " I know , but it wo n't be my fault when it does . " <p> They were using part of the old changing room for Viverta 's cleanroom techs . Jeremy hung up his new jacket , but left the tie on . He liked wearing grown-up clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cufflinks and suspenders . Back in grad school he had started dressing like a banker after noticing one day that everyone except the university president dressed in exactly the same outfit of jeans and T  --  shirts , as if some academic Taliban would stone them otherwise . <p> He put on his cleansuit . It was futuretech , of course - no sense risking your health on primitive twenty-first century gear . The suit was as thin and filmy as plastic wrap , but it was proof against all pathogens that would ever be known . The hood and gloves automatically sealed themselves onto the suit , merging to form a single , seamless unit . A tiny shoulder pack filtered the air , giving him a pure mix of oxygen , nitrogen , and water vapor . <p> The day 's work assignments were taped to the wall next to the door . Jeremy had rooms 315 through 319 today . Mr. Pettigrew was waiting outside , and the two of them went upstairs together in silence . <p> Viverta had been hit particularly hard by the arrival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week after the Geneva team got their second timegate up and running ( following instructions sent back through the first timegate ) , a present came through from the deep future - three dozen optical disks holding everything about medicine that would ever be known . The next day the doors at the Viverta labs were locked and the lights were off . They stayed that way for fourteen years while the world economy adjusted and investors stopped driving their BMWs off cliffs . <p> All of which meant the cleanup job was especially nasty , since some of the freezers had tissue samples or even whole fetal pigs in them . Fourteen years in a sealed freezer that was n't running turned them into a horrible anaerobic soup , with a smell that nothing short of a futuretech cleansuit could keep out . <p> Happily for Jeremy , room 315 did n't have any liquid pigs to deal with . The refrigerators were full of water samples from rivers contaminated with waste from hog farms ; the project running when the lab closed down had been to identify specific pathogens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers did n't have to accidentally dump millions of gallons of pig sewage into the watershed every time their waste lagoons got full . ( Nowadays people simply fed any kind of waste into a futuretech matter processor , which reduced everything to basic molecules and rearranged them to suit . ) <p> According to the future histories , one of the water samples Jeremy was to dispose of contained a mutant airborne strain of swine encephalitis capable of infecting humans . With Mr. Pettigrew watching him , Jeremy pulled each tray of test tubes from the refrigerator , checked the faded label stickers against the company logs , then loaded them into the portable autoclave to be heat sterilized at 200 degrees Centigrade . <p> Having Pettigrew around was a real nuisance , Jeremy decided . Normally he could read a book or play games on his pad while one load was cooking , but with the boss watching he actually had to keep working . So he took out a second tray to begin checking labels . He slid it out of the refrigerator , turned , and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several of the vials shattered . <p> " Damn ! " Pettigrew backed away , brushing at the droplets on his suit . <p> " Will you relax already ? " said Jeremy . " It 's not going to happen till after lunch ! Quit hovering ! " <p> " Check it out anyway . Is it infectious ? " <p> " I do n't know ! What did you think you were doing ? " <p> " You looked like you were going to drop them ! " Pettigrew kept backing up as he spoke , his eyes fixed on the mess . " What do the labels say ? " <p> Jeremy squinted at the numbers on the stickers and compared them with the list on his pad . " It 's okay . These are all control samples from Kerr Lake . " <p> " You 're sure ? Could they be mislabeled ? " <p> " Well , yes , I guess they could . You want to declare a biohazard and seal the place up ? We 'll have to stay in quarantine together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen this morning ? " <p> " I read my own book ! The accident 's after lunch . " <p> " Well , then , just autoclave the glass and wash down the floor with the antibiotic spray . Do n't waste it - just spray where it spilled . I 'm going to change . " <p> As soon as Pettigrew was out of the room , Jeremy got out the antibiotic spray and began lavishly squirting it all over the room . It was pricey futuretech stuff , and anything he could do to cost Pettigrew money was always a plus . He used up the whole bottle . The spray was essentially an instant immune system , full of nanomachines programmed to recognize and destroy a couple of million different varieties of harmful organisms . <p> As he worked a cheerful thought struck him . He 'd always been clumsy , always dropping things and bumping into furniture . Today 's little incident with the water samples was certainly not his first on the job . Maybe the virus spill really would be just an accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's number . " Hi , Ma . " <p> " Jeremy , are you at work ? " <p> " Yes , Ma . " She had that weepy note in her voice that he 'd been hearing a lot lately . <p> " Are you all right ? " <p> " I 'm fine , Ma . Do n't worry about me . Has anyone been bothering you today ? " <p> " A man from the radio station called me this morning , and after that I turned off the phone . Did you get your shots ? " <p> " Months ago . Do n't worry . " <p> " I got a copy of your book but I just could n't bring myself to read it . I do n't see how you can stand it , knowing what 's going to happen . " <p> " It bothers me too , Ma . " <p> " What I do n't understand is how all these people seem to think it 's your fault . If they all know what 's going to happen , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , they are . Some of them , anyway . The health service is giving out the shots , the CDC has all the future info about how the virus spreads , and I think they 're going to notify every victim directly . If it was n't for people knowing about it in advance , I 'm sure the virus would be a lot worse . It 's just like a hurricane - they can warn people and evacuate the coast , but there 's always a few idiots who get killed . " <p> " I guess I 'm just too old to understand it . Is there anything I can do for you ? Are they going to take you to jail afterwards , or something like that ? " <p> " I know I 'm going to be in quarantine for a few days ; I gave Miguel my house key so he can feed the cats . And then I think the FBI or someone will have me in protective custody because of all the loonies . I 'll keep in touch ; do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or so . " <p> She was starting to cry again . " It 's just not fair ! You were always such a good boy . " <p> " I 'll be okay , Ma . I have to go now , someone 's coming . Everything will be all right . I love you . Bye . " <p> He was unloading the broken glass from the autoclave when Simon came in , all suited up . " Pettigrew said to come up and help you . Today 's your big day , right ? " <p> " Right . " <p> Simon got uncomfortably close and put an arm around Jeremy . " Ever think about fighting back ? " he asked quietly . <p> " What ? " <p> " Fighting back . Against railroading . " <p> For a second Jeremy wondered if Simon was referring to some obscure labor dispute , and then he placed the phrase . " You 're one of those Schrodinger Front guys , are n't you ? " <p> " That 's right . You know about us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole bunch of email from some Schrodinger people a while back , but I did n't really read most of it . " He tried to ease away from Simon as politely as he could , but Simon was bigger and was n't letting go . <p> " We 're trying to preserve free will . Everyone knows what 's going to happen , right ? Only they do n't . All they know is what future history says . History can be wrong . " <p> " But , I mean , I 'm going to write a book about all this . It really is going to happen to me . " <p> " Maybe . Maybe not . You change your story , do n't you ? " <p> " Yeah . Twice , actually . At the trial and in my book I say it 's an accident . Then , when I 'm fifty , I say in an interview that it 's all my fault and I 'm responsible . But a few years after that I go back to blaming fate . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our goal in the Front is to change the way things happen and not tell anyone . Make all recorded history a lie . Jump the tracks . Then we 'll be free . " <p> Jeremy finally wriggled out of Simon 's grip by spinning around and getting the autoclave between them . " You 've been working here for three months just for this ? You ca n't keep it from happening . " <p> " I do n't want to . I want to take your place . " " What ? But you ca n't . " <p> " Sure I can . Go wait in another room . Or sit here and keep me company . But I 'll be the one to dump the sample . " <p> " What on Earth will that accomplish ? " <p> " You still do n't see ? It changes everything ! If you do it , you 're just riding the railroad . I 'll be a free agent . History will be wrong . " <p> " But what difference does it make ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . Just because you do it instead of me does n't change anything . " <p> " It means people can still choose . " <p> " Look , Simon , if it 's that important to you , go ahead . I do n't mind taking a break . " Privately , Jeremy thought Simon was completely cracked , but if a crazy man wanted to do his work for him , that was cool . <p> So for the next half hour Jeremy played Zeppelin Commando on his pad while Simon autoclaved tray after tray of samples . By eleven o'clock all of Room 315 was sterilized , and the two of them moved down the hall to 317 . By eleven-thirty he was on the final level of his game , evading British fighters and flak over London , going for the big prize of capturing George V , when his phone chirped again . <p> He checked the display , expecting to see his mother 's number again . But it was n't any phone number he recognized . That was weird - he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close friends and family . Had someone gotten greedy and passed it on to a reporter ? <p> It peeped for the third time and Jeremy reluctantly hit the talk button . " Hello ? " <p> " Hi , Jeremy ! " It was a young woman 's voice , and he needed a second to place it . <p> " Vera ? " His expression changed from suspicion and irritation to that of a boy on Christmas morning who finds everything he asked for plus a puppy under the tree . " How 've you been ? " <p> " I 'm okay . You want to get together ? I 'm right outside in the parking lot . " <p> " Sure ! I 'm free right now . Um- can you get around to the front of the building without being noticed ? Over by the fountains ? " <p> " I think so . " <p> " Good . I 'll let you in . " He turned off the phone and looked over at Simon , who was studiously ignoring him . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ahead . Have fun . " <p> Even covered with a decade of dust the old lobby was grand and expensive-looking . The floors and walls were greenish-white travertine with burnished stainless steel fittings . The receptionist 's desk was a stone slab on steel legs in the exact center of the big room . It reminded Jeremy of a morgue table . <p> Vera was waiting outside alone , so he unlocked the doors . As soon as they were open she flung herself at him , holding him and giving him a long hard kiss with plenty of tongue action . <p> " Wow ! I 'm glad to see you , too , " he said when they finally came up for air . <p> " Did you miss me ? " <p> " Sure . What happened to you ? I called and called but kept getting a message about your phone not being available , and after a while I figured you did n't want to talk to me . " <p> " My grandmother got sick and I had to go out to Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon ? I thought you were from Greensboro . " <p> " Oh , I am . But my grandmother lives in Oregon . " <p> " She all right ? " <p> " Yeah . It was some kind of heart thing , but she 's okay now . " She gave him another devouring kiss , and he breathed in the scent of her perfume . <p> " How long can you stay ? We could have lunch , or something . " <p> " I 'm free all afternoon , " she said , and gave him a squeeze . " As long as you want . I thought you might want to be with someone who loves you today . " <p> " I just wish this was a better time . It 's been pretty rough this past week , and I 'm afraid it 's just going to get worse after today . After the accident I 'm going into quarantine , and I do n't think they 'll let me have visitors . " <p> " Wan na sneak away somewhere right now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Jeremy felt like a teenager again , realizing for the first time that a girl actually wanted to have sex with him . His mouth was dry and he could hear his heart beating . He could n't think of anything to say , so he just kissed her again , savoring the way her body felt pressed against his . His hands slipped down her back to rest on her hips . <p> Jeremy did n't know how long he could resist the urge to start ripping off her clothes then and there . He disengaged himself and stepped back . " Well , you 're looking great . Is that the same dress you wore at the Halloween party ? " It was a little frock of futuretech cloth that hugged her figure like a coat of paint and swirled with slow hypnotic patterns of color that borrowed from the surroundings . Right now it was all pale green and gray , with occasional streaks of bright yellow from the sunlight on the lawn outside . <p> " You liked it so much I made sure to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . " His gaze moved down to her hands , and then he saw the smudgy little orange pumpkin on the back of her left wrist . " How long has it been ? " he asked , keeping his voice casual . <p> " Eight months . " <p> " No . How long has it been for you ? A day ? You did n't even have time to wash off the hand stamp from the party . " <p> She tried to cover the pumpkin with her other hand . " I - " <p> " You left the next morning , did n't you ? Right after I dropped you off at UNC . You went over to the gate and jumped straight to today . " <p> She was silent for just a moment , then smiled at him . " Okay , yes . I traveled through time to see you again . " <p> " When are you from ? You 're not my great-granddaughter or something , are you ? " <p> " No , no , " she laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; my parents are probably hooking up about now . I read your book and wanted to meet you . " <p> " So you could brag about having fucked Jeremy Calder the day he spilled the virus ! Do you guys have some kind of league ? How many points am I worth ? " <p> " No , it 's not like that at all ! You sounded like such a fascinating person that I wanted to know you . " <p> " If I 'm such a goddamned fascinating person why did n't you bother hanging around for the past eight months ? You could get to know me really well in all that time . " <p> " I could n't stay . " <p> " Bullshit . If you can afford to time-hop you could buy a house , or stay in a hotel for eight months . Hell , you could 've stayed at my place for free ! " <p> " You 're right . I 've been completely selfish . I 'm sorry . Let me make it up to you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suit . <p> " Stop that , dammit ! " He backed away . Any feelings of arousal had long since been wiped away by anger and humiliation . <p> " Do n't you want me ? " She touched a hidden seam on her dress and opened it down to her navel . " I 'll do anything you want . Anything at all . " <p> " Go away . Go home . Go fuck some serial killer or seduce a future president . I 'm not going to be stuffed and mounted on your wall . " <p> He was halfway across the room when she spoke again , in a very different tone . " Jeremy ? What you said about me living at your place- is that true ? Did you really like me that much ? " <p> Jeremy stopped but did n't turn around . " Yes . I thought I did , but I guess I was wrong . Goodbye , Vera . " He stabbed the elevator button and stood there silently . Behind him he heard the door to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little numbly , trying to think of what to do next . Screw it , he decided . I 'm going home . <p> He opened the door to 317 and stuck his head in . " Simon ? " <p> Simon was in the middle of unloading the autoclave . He gave a start at the sound and accidentally touched the still-hot inside wall with one arm . He jerked it back quickly , but there was an awful smell of melting plastic and even from the door Jeremy could see a big red mark on Simon 's arm . <p> " Here , quick ! " He shoved Simon over to the safety shower and pulled the handle , washing his arm with tepid water and peeling away bits of melted cleansuit . The burn was pretty bad , covering the whole top of Simon 's right forearm from elbow to wrist . <p> " I think this one is more than a first-aid kit job , Simon . You 're going to need an emergency room . " <p> " No ! Not yet . Let me finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already starting to blister . And besides , your cleansuit 's wrecked anyway . " <p> " But - " Simon was almost in tears , and Jeremy did n't think it was just from the pain of the bum . <p> " There 's no point in arguing . You ca n't work with a burn like that . Even Pettigrew would agree . " He half-led , half-shoved Simon through the door and down the hall to the elevator . They found Mr. Pettigrew in his office next to the changing room . Pettigrew overruled Simon 's protests and called an ambulance . <p> The sirens drove the crowd outside into a near panic . Both the demonstrators and the media pushed through the barricades when the paramedics hurried in , and the police were hard-pressed to keep them back . <p> " It 's getting ugly out there , " Pettigrew observed , looking through the little window in the back door while the medics squirted anaesthetic onto Simon 's bum . " You think maybe you could go out and tell them nothing 's happened ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You 're the only one they 'd pay any attention to . I 'll go ask the police lieutenant if he 'd be willing to clear a space . " <p> While Mr. Pettigrew and the policeman talked it over , Jeremy went to the changing room and shed his cleansuit . He put on his new coat and tie again , and made sure his hair was neatly combed . He was just finishing up when Pettigrew came back looking cheerful . <p> " I talked him into it , " he said . <p> " I knew you would , " said Jeremy . He had seen the tape . <p> The police lieutenant , whose nametag read BYNUM , wanted to keep Jeremy in the loading dock , so that it would be easy to hold the crowd back . But the TV crews complained that the contrast between the bright sunlight out in the parking lot and the shadowed loading dock made it like shooting into a cave . There was some more arguing , with Mr. Pettigrew , Lieutenant Bynum , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the steps while Jeremy sat on top of a biohazard container in the loading dock and tried to keep his suit clean . <p> " Okay , " said Pettigrew . " I think we 've got a plan here . The police are going to set up a line down at the end of the building , between the corner and that bulldozer . The light angle 's good there for the TV people , and when they 're all ready then you come out of the fire exit on that end . Sound good ? " <p> " It 's fine . " Jeremy had to smile at Pettigrew 's sudden transformation into a stage manager . <p> He took up his position at the fire exit with Pettigrew and Lieutenant Bynum while the media people got ready , then the three of them opened the door and stepped out . After the air-conditioned chill of the building and the ultra-pure air of his cleansuit , the atmosphere in the parking lot was like soup . He had to pick his way carefully from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the parking lot was liberally coated with red mud from the demolition equipment . <p> Some of the protestors who had accumulated on the fringes of the press conference started moving to intercept him . Lieutenant Bynum saw what was happening and muttered into his radio microphone . " Get back ! " he said to Jeremy and Pettigrew , then advanced on the protestors with his arms extended in a traffic-stopping gesture . <p> Mr. Pettigrew turned and broke into a trot , heading for the fire door . Jeremy followed . He tried to keep from getting his good shoes all muddy , but the broken edge of the parking lot had few clean places to step . He tried to hop over a puddle , slipped , and landed sitting down in orange mud . <p> Jeremy got up and looked around . The cops had halted the demonstrators , and Pettigrew was already inside . He looked down . His suit was a total loss ; the pants were soaked and the jacket was spattered with Carolina clay . Even his tie had mud on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squelched to the fire door . <p> " You okay ? " Pettigrew pulled the door shut behind him . " I thought those crazy people were going to attack us or something . " <p> " The cops headed them off . I fell in a puddle . " <p> " You sure are a mess . Ca n't go on TV looking like that . Got any clean clothes ? " <p> " Not here . " <p> " I 'll see what I can find for you . You can wash up in one of the empty labs . " <p> So Jeremy peeled off his muddy suit and had an improvised bath under the safety shower in Room 160 . When he finished drying himself off with paper towels , Pettigrew tapped at the door . <p> " Here . They 're Antonio 's , but he said you could borrow them . " He handed Jeremy a bundle of folded clothes : a T-shirt and a pair of khakis , just like in the pictures . <p> " Is n't there anything else ? " Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is all I could find . The only other person with spare clothes is Diana . Come on , the reporters are waiting . " <p> Moving very slowly , as if underwater , Jeremy started to put on the clothes ... the awful clothes he remembered seeing in the videos from the future . The T-shirt said NICE PEOPLE SWALLOW on it in big letters . <p> It hit him then . There was no avoiding it . He was riding Simon 's railroad now , strapped in and hurtling along . Until he put on the T-shirt , he had somehow hoped it might come out differently . But now it was plain : Fate was n't even going to let him pick his clothes . <p> There was a solid line of cops from the fire door to the press area when he went out again , but Jeremy barely noticed . He got through the press conference by dully repeating the answers he remembered from watching the tapes . He started out by assuring everyone that the spill had n't happened yet , urged everyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the future victims of the virus and their families . <p> When the cameras finally were switched off and the crowd started to disperse , Jeremy let Pettigrew and Lieutenant Bynum lead him back inside . <p> " You look awful , " Pettigrew told him when they got back inside . " You want to go home ? " <p> " No . There 's no point in asking , is there ? We know I wo n't . " <p> " Well , you can if you want to . Take the afternoon off . " <p> " If I say yes my car wo n't start or something . I ca n't afford some big garage bill . " Pettigrew followed him to the changing room and watched Jeremy put on his cleansuit , but did n't say anything more . <p> The crew sent out an order for lunch to the Jamaican place , and the delivery guy managed to fight his way through the crowd with their jerk chicken sandwiches and meat pies . For once Jeremy did n't join the others in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-posh executive meeting room on the fifth floor . There was no furniture there anymore , but it had a great view across the Research Triangle Park toward Raleigh . <p> He wished he was one of the deep-future people . From everything he 'd heard , this kind of thing did n't bother them . They got a complete set of memories the day they were born , lasting until the end of time . They switched bodies and traded memories as easily as clothing , jumping around through their own and other people 's lives as nothing but disembodied viewpoints , sometimes crowding together a dozen at a time in one head for a particularly interesting experience , and skimming through unpleasant patches on autopilot . Their lives were like books , and they could skip ahead to the good parts . <p> After lunch he finished up the work Simon had left in 317 and moved on to 319 . The fridge in 319 was full of groundwater samples taken at various depths in hog-farming areas . There were only three racks of vials , and Jeremy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logging the specimen numbers and making sure the autoclave was working properly . <p> By the time he finished the second rack , Jeremy was almost worried . There was only one rack of vials left , and so far he had n't broken or spilled anything . He carefully slid the third rack of samples out of the refrigerator and carried it over to the autoclave . He logged the specimen numbers and switched the machine on . It started up without a hitch . Instead of reading or playing a game , he stood over the autoclave while it ran through the entire twenty-minute cycle . <p> When the timer peeped , Jeremy felt a thrilling mix of exhilaration and fear . That was the last of the samples . He was done ! Somehow he had dodged the bullet ! He pulled out the tray and emptied it triumphantly into the waste bin . All sterile and clean . Whistling happily he went back to the fridge for the final check . <p> His good mood lasted only two seconds more , for on the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already picked it up when he realized what it must be . The vial was unlabeled . On the fridge floor he saw a little square of yellowed paper , with some numbers scrawled on it in green pen . This was it . HNE-2038 . All he had to do was put it in the autoclave and cook the little bastards to death . <p> The floor between him and the autoclave looked suddenly full of traps - the sloppy coil of the extension cord , a peeled-up patch of tile , a dropped pencil . Something was going to make him trip or stumble . <p> His cleansuit gloves were already damp and slippery with condensed steam after loading and unloading the autoclave . He took one unsteady step - it was almost as if he 'd forgotten how to walk . Was his hand trembling ? <p> Suddenly it all seemed so unfair . He 'd been careful . He 'd done everything properly . Now fate , or whatever it was , was going to make him fall down and break the vial no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell with it . " Jeremy threw the sample across the room as hard as he could . It bounced on the countertop , hit the steel rim of a sink , and shattered . Droplets scattered everywhere . <p> " You see ? " he shouted at nobody in particular . " I did that ! You did n't make me . I did it on purpose . " He waited for a moment , as if expecting an answer . Then he took a deep breath and flipped on his phone . <p> " Mr. Pettigrew ? " Jeremy 's voice was calm again . " We have a biohazard emergency in room 319 . I just broke the vial . " He switched it off and put it back in his pocket . Then he sat down and waited . Now it was somebody else 's problem . <p> IMG
