<p> Sin , sex and immorality <p> Editor  --  I was lucky enough to work with the Rev. John Malloy for six years . More than once I told him he was the most hated priest in San Francisco . Because San Francisco is ground zero for the " culture of death , " it was meant as a compliment . Father John is hated ( and loved ) because he is a Catholic priest who teaches Catholic doctrine  --  one of which is the sinfulness of homosexual behavior . <p> That teaching is well-known : It 's why the S.F. Board of Supervisors issued a resolution on March 21 , 2006 , calling the Catholic Church hateful and bigoted . That 's a deliberate misrepresentation , but at least we know where they stand . I just wish the letter-writers attacking Father John would skip the " shocked , shocked " posing . <p> The Rev. Robert Warren Cromey ( Letters , " Readers react to Father John , " July 14 ) says " Jesus never mentioned same-gender sexuality . " Well , Jesus never mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honesty on the part of his hearers . The Rev. Jim Schexnayder ( Letters , July 14 ) asks " Imagine that a Catholic priest announces to his congregation that he is heterosexual ... " <p> Yes , one needs to imagine it , because it does n't happen . Heterosexual people do n't identify themselves by their sexual preferences  --  doing so is a sign of the " objective disorder " the church teaches . <p> GIBBONS J. COONEY <p> San Francisco  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  The Rev. John Malloy was my pastor  --  I love him dearly . <p> The Rev. Robert Cromey 's letter of July 14 raises an important issue about the emphasis on homosexual immorality almost to the exclusion of heterosexual immortality . For example , pornography is a problem among married men . <p> However , what Cromey and the Rev. Jim Schexnayder do not seem to know is that Father Malloy is the only pastor who promotes a ministry that reaches out to help people addicted to porn as well as individuals who struggle with same-sex attraction . ( He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all else , to love others as Christ loves us . ) <p> Indeed , this is why I look to Father John Malloy and priests like him who have the courage to risk our anger and disfavor by not only calling us to righteousness , but committing their life and ministry to helping us find the way . <p> A good surgeon does not hesitate to cut away cancerous growth ; a good priest does not hesitate to cut away our sin . If only we had more priests like Father Malloy . <p> DOLORES MEEHAN <p> San Francisco  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Reaction to my letter to the editor ( " Father John responds , " July 7 ) referring to homosexuals was not unexpected ( " Readers react to Father John , " July 14 ) . I was only expounding the Catholic teaching in reference to sexual actions . Many people , also of the Catholic faith , seem unclear about Christ 's teaching in this regard . <p> We believe that Scripture and the teaching of the official Catholic Church , i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of moral principles . Christ loved sinners . He did not tolerate sin . True , not all of those inclined to a homosexual lifestyle are guilty of sin . <p> Sex is for marriage : the procreation of children and the mutual love of a man and woman . Homosexuals who live together can not fulfill those conditions , but they can live chastely . The Catholic program " Courage " assists in this . <p> Sexual acts outside of marriage are immoral , even if declared legal . Some married couples are also sinful in their actions . We have preached and taught that for years . As for the " presumptions " of the Rev. Jim Schexnayder , I suggest that he check out the video of the Gay Pride Parade , to see the obscenities promoted in that venue . <p> The Rev. JOHN MALLOY , SDB <p> Richmond  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Robert Warren Cromey of San Francisco remarks that many two-sex couples practice the same perversions as gays . Gays we can understand and sympathize with , because they can not copulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no excuse : their sin is greater . Perhaps Father John should have mentioned that . <p> JOHN A. WILLS <p> Oakland  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Letter-writer Robert Warren Cromey states that " Jesus ' ministry was about inclusion of all people ... " Nothing could be further from the truth . <p> In Matthew 15:24 , it is written : " But he answered and said , ' I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel . ' " Two verses later , he calls the Gentiles dogs . Clearly , Jesus came only for the Jews . I do n't remember reading anything where Jesus condemned homosexuals , per se . It does n't seem to have been important to him . <p> RICHARD SUTHERLAND <p> Los Altos <p> Just like real life <p> Editor  --  It 's been a tough couple of weeks for the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church , and I appreciate that The Chronicle has reported fairly about what has been going on . But after seeing letters to the editor refer to the Vatican declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have to protest . <p> They are , of course , quoting an Associated Press-sourced article from the July 11 Chronicle that said pretty much the same thing . But the Vatican document in question , in fact , explicitly acknowledges that Protestant and other Christian groups are " instruments of salvation . " The most controversial part about the document is the Vatican saying once again that Catholicism has the " fullness of grace and truth . " <p> Maybe this was n't necessary , but wade through the theological language , and this seems a lot as if one party in a conversation ( or argument ) is insisting that their opinion is the right one , which in real life is what many regular people do . <p> The Rev. BRETT HOOVER <p> Berkeley <p> It 's quite simple <p> Editor  --  I found Bill Carman 's July 17 letter , " Religious rationale , " to be quite irrational . Carman uses the misconduct of a few Catholic priests to label all religion as confusing and goofy . <p> I am a Protestant nondenominational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid my penalty by dying for me . That 's all there is to it . Christianity is really quite simple , if people will just take the Bible for what it says . <p> JEFFREY BEAN Jr . <p> Santa Rosa <p>  --  ' Where have you gone , Joe DiMaggio ? ' <p> Editor  --  I would not be surprised if the public baseball diamond being sold by the cash-strapped Vallejo Unified School District for a housing development was , like so many others we take for granted , created by the Works Progress Administration about 70 years ago as an expression of " the New Recreation " ( " Play ball ? But where ? , " July 17 ) . <p> We have inherited many of our public ballparks , tennis courts , golf courses , tracks and swimming pools as well as our schools from President Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal . Roosevelt 's brain trusters felt that young men would be better socialized and avoid delinquency by engaging in supervised sports rather than riding boxcars or joining gangs . Both Bill Clinton neoliberals and George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be sold . Thus , we achieve short-term gain and long-term societal suicide . <p> GRAY BRECHIN <p> Berkeley  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  It 's a sad day when a school district is forced to sell its neighborhood baseball fields to bail itself out of a financial hole . More tragic , with all the daily " hoopla " printed surrounding professional baseball in the Bay Area , I have to wonder where are all our baseball " stars , " with their million-dollar lifestyles , when things like this go down ? <p> Would n't it be nice to have read of someone ( or several of them ) stepping in to save these fields for these youngsters , who now have nowhere to play baseball in their neighborhoods ? Where is Joe DiMaggio when you need him ? <p> JENNIFER HAYES <p> Oakland <p> So what ? <p> Editor  --  Let 's suppose that after weeks of hearings , Rep. Henry Waxman 's committee conclusively proves that then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld orchestrated the cover-up of Pat Tillman 's friendly-fire death three years ago . So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will Tillman 's survivors sleep easier ? Will the daily deaths of dozens of Iraqis and American soldiers cease ? Will the millions of dollars the United States is spending each day in Iraq suddenly become available to take care of America 's roads , helpless folk , air , forests , health , schools ? <p> Democrats such as Waxman just do n't get it . The Democrats will never attract enthusiasm from progressives such as me until they stop wasting their energy trying to embarrass the Republicans and instead focus on projects that could make a positive difference in American lives . <p> PAUL M. ROSE <p> San Francisco <p> Classic threads <p> Editor  --  Ah ! The closet readers of Harry Potter have outed themselves and are apparently proud of having rediscovered classical threads in the book series ( " Pitter-patter on the pride of a Potterhead , " July 15 ) . <p> The repackaging of plots and characters for new audiences are a writer 's meat and potatoes . As we all know , there are only a few established plots we humans are capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not read Harry and Monday night saw my first Potter film : " The Order of the Phoenix . " The climax of the this " new classic " series was written thousands of years ago , and yet again copied by George Lucas and now J.K. Rowling : Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader become Harry Potter and Daddy Potter . As the Greeks proclaimed ; " The king is dead ! Long live the king ! " <p> We can only wait for Harry to have a son ... <p> BRENT MacKINNON <p> South Lake Tahoe <p> Not so green <p> Editor  --  There is no doubt that Vicki Haddock 's rant on the pious nature of Prius drivers will result in an onslaught of letters from owners in defense of their righteous ways ( " Oh , so pious , Prius drivers , " Insight , July 15 ) . I only wish the writer would have highlighted CNW 's " Dust to Dust " report in which they granularly calculate the total energy impact and cost of every automobile sold in the United States from development to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon tire print during its lifetime , poseurs Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore might not be so vocal in support . From the higher energy impact of the Prius ' low weight steel , to the very messy processing of the nickel for its batteries all the way to the difficult recycling of these and other materials , the Prius looks more like a Hummer than a savior . The energy cost per mile for a lifetime in a Prius was $3.25 , ranking No. 234 out of 323 cars sold in the United States in 2007 . The Hummer H2 was $3.03 . Who should be flipping off whom ? <p> If drivers really wish to live green , not simply look green , the winner was the Scion xB at $.492 . <p> TIM DAVIS <p> Walnut Creek  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  When I bought my Prius earlier this year , I did it , in part , as a small gesture against atmospheric pollution . The acquisition was to some extent an acknowledgment of my contribution to global warming . I felt no piety or smugness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limbaugh loathes both the Prius and its drivers . Now , I feel a little bit smug . <p> JOHN STEDMAN <p> San Francisco <p> Human torturers <p> Editor  --  In the July 14 article , " Torched kitten on the mend , " I 'm surprised the max penalty for cruelty to animals is just 3 years in juvenile hall . If the reverse happened , and a deranged mountain lion tried to kill a human being , that animal would be shot and killed immediately ! <p> Because the female human perpetrators have already reached adolescent age , have never developed any nurturing skills and have no respect for life , it is highly unlikely they will ever make good mothers . <p> Even if they are sentenced to the maximum 3 years , if released without consistent long-term psychological care , history has proven that their cruelty will escalate to include human life  --  they are a grave threat to society . <p> JEFFREY TONG <p> San Bruno ( 1 ) The Rev.
