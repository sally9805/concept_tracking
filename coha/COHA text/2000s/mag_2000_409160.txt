The Visible Layers of Jupiter Your article " Jupiter 's Deep Mystery " ( December 1999 , page 118 ) quotes the " view " of Jose Olivarez that Jupiter 's blue features are warmer than their surroundings . In fact this whole issue was resolved by me and others a generation ago . In May 1972 , while working with C. S. L. Keay , E J. Low , and G. H. Rieke , I discovered that the blue features on Jupiter are indeed the warmest ( and therefore presumably the deepest in Jupiter 's atmosphere ) . The three other authors had been mapping Jupiter at an infrared wavelength of 5 microns with the same telescope , the Catalina 61-inch reflector , that I had been using for color photography of the planet . They approached me one afternoon asking if I could recognize their 5-micron hot spots . After I laid out all the recent color photos of Jupiter and compared them to the 5-micron images , a realization hit me like a tidal wave . The warmest regions were the blue-gray festoons , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the white zones . The reddish orange areas such as the Great Red Spot were the coldest and therefore presumably highest . I measured every feature on every image and compiled maps and graphs of the results . When I showed George Rieke my discovery of the color-temperature relation , he was almost overcome with joy . His group had been stymied by their reliance on black-and-white photography through red and blue filters ; color photography easily resolved the ambiguities . He insisted that I be included as a coauthor of their paper , which was published in the Astrophysical Journal for August 1 , 1973 . Shortly after-ward Carl Sagan wrote that we had confirmed his prediction that the blue areas should be warmest . R. B. MINTON 568 N. First St. Raton , NM 87740 What 's Wrong with an Achromat ? I read with interest Alan Dyer 's review " A Trio of Refractors " in the November issue ( page 57 ) . I am a telescope and mirror maker and a pretty darn good one . I have been using large , homemade Dobsonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trade I recently received a Celestron C102HD 4  --  inch refractor . This is the new Chinese clone of the old Celestron C102 . After reading Dyer questioning the " usefulness in the marketplace ... for classic achromatic refractors " I wondered if I should just pack up the scope without giving it a look . But guess what ? This instrument is exciting , " to use Dyer 's phrase . It provides sharp , contrasty views of the planets , pinpoint stars , and better color correction than I would have dreamed for its focal ratio of f/10 . The only time I noticed chromatic aberration was when using 150X on Jupiter - while seeing sharp detail inside the Red Spot Hollow and perceiving Jupiter 's moons as defined disks . Not bad for a dull scope . If I had to recommend a beginner 's scope that delivers great images , is smooth to operate , and wo n't break the bank , this " inferior " achromat is the ticket . Right now I ca n't wait to get home from work and bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PA 19320 astroramrx@hotmail.com Small-Scope Cruising As a one-year rookie subscriber , I want to tell you how much I enjoy Sky &; Telescope and especially Sue French 's " Small  --  Scope Sampler " articles on the monthly foldout . I can usually find only about half of what she describes , due to the bright lights of Baltimore and my " all thumbs " beginner 's fumbling . But it 's a great exercise and a real thrill when I can pick out the double stars , clusters , and other objects that she features . The lore of the stars and practical advice are also invaluable . For instance , the shape of NGC 457 jumped right out at me . It is a dragonfly ! Photograph The blue-gray festoons running diagonally across Jupiter 's Equatorial Zone are the warmest parts of the planet 's visible surface - a sign that they afford us views deep into Jupiter 's cloud decks . The festoons were unusually prominent last year . This first-rate CCD image was taken by Antonlo J.

In his article " Celestial Spectacular in Cepheus " ( S &T.; November 1999 , page 124 ) James Mullaney notes that the large , dim nebulosity IC 1396 can be seen in a 3-inch scope . While lying on the stone wall by the pink Stellafane clubhouse some 15 years ago , I spotted it using a nebula filter with a 1/2-inch ( 11  --  millimeter ) scope at just under 2x . The " telescope " was a 50-mm camera lens attached to a 32-mm eyepiece . Perhaps I was too inexperienced to try looking through the nebula filter with no other optics at all . The trick to using a nebula filter with the naked eye is to block out all stray light . Try screwing the filter into an empty eyepiece barrel . Technically this is not " unaided " viewing , but it 's certainly not " telescopic . " ALISTER LING 473 Burton Rd .

I particularly enjoyed Charles Wood 's column , " Lunar Ray Mysteries . " The Moon 's fascinating ray features are currently the focus of a joint venture by the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers , the British Astronomical Association , and other groups and individuals . Our International Bright Lunar Rays Project is trying to document anything and everything observable about lunar rays ; we welcome photographs , sketches , and electronic images from observers at all levels of experience .

Nevertheless , a perusal of The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci ( compiled and edited by Jean Paul Richter , Dover Publications , Vol .

" No evidence exists that he attempted to make these magic glasses .

MARK GINGRICH 355 Estabrook St. , Apt. 403 San Leandro , CA 94577 grinch@rahul.net For the Record . In our review of 8-inch Dobsonian telescopes ( January issue ) , the Optics table on page 66 mistakenly showed an asterisk next to the 8-inch aperture of the Meade Starfinder . The effective aperture is indeed 8 inches , as noted in the text , so no manufacturer fix to this is needed or planned . In the Apollo 8 photograph of the Earth from the Moon , the terminator across Africa is the line of sunset , not sunrise ( January issue , page 38 ) .
