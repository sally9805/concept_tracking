Maybe it was U.S. Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge 's visit to London . Or maybe it was just more aftershocks from last month 's bombing in Bali . But Europe was starting to feel a lot like the U.S. , as terror alerts were issued across the continent . In Britain , the Home Office issued a statement saying that terrorists may " try to develop a so-called dirty bomb or some kind of poison gas , " though within an hour the statement was replaced by a less frightening one . In Berlin , Germany 's intelligence chief , August Hanning , said on TV : " The fear is very concrete that we must reckon with a further attack ... of perhaps great dimension . " Hans-Josef Beth , who heads the international counterterrorism unit of Germany 's foreign intelligence agency , fingered Abu Musab Zarqawi , a one-legged terrorist with known al-Qaeda connections , as the probable mastermind of possible chemical attacks on European targets . Zarqawi has ordered trained operatives into Europe , Beth said at a meeting in Berlin . " Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French , too , were alarmed . " We 're absolutely scrambling here , " said a top French terrorist judge . " Every light in every service in France is full red . " <P> When could an attack come ? Omar Bakri Muhammad , the London-based leader of the radical Muslim al-Muhajiroun youth movement , points to the month of Ramadan , which began Nov. 6 . It is " the month of jihad , " he told TIME , when " the inspiration of fighting against occupiers and invaders will be very high . That is why I would not be surprised if al-Qaeda strikes in the month of Ramadan . " Scared yet ?  --  By Bruce Crumley/Paris , Helen Gibson/London and Steve Zwick/Cologne
