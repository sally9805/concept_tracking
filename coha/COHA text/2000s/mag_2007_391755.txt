Gerard Butler ' ' 300 ' put him ( and his abs ) on the map " When Hollywood makes a movie , there 's a pretty short list of actors you 're supposed to talk to . Gerry was n't on that list . What I liked about him was that he 'd read the graphic novel and got what we were doing . It 's not easy to stand in front of a greenscreen in a little leather outfit and not feel exposed , but he did n't care . No , I do n't feel like I discovered Gerry , because if it was n't my movie it would 've been someone else's. "  --  ZACK SNYDER Director of ' ' 300 ' WHY HIM Video stores are littered with the corpses of movies that tried to be Gladiator and failed . But this year , 300 got it right by spiking its ancient story line ( the Spartan stand at the Battle of Thermopylae ) with eye-candy F/X and giddy amounts of gore . With its jaw-dropping $71 million first weekend , 300 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn as the impossibly muscled King Leonidas may be the most ferocious performance since Russell Crowe 's Maximus . We do n't throw praise like that around lightly . In other words : Yes , we were entertained . Amy Winehouse On stage and off , she sings her own tune " ' Back to Black " was a phenomenal album . Her voice just completely blew me away . I 've seen her live , and she is the real deal , although she sometimes can be hit-and-miss depending on how out of it she is . It 's like Nina Simone and Van Morrison : You do n't know what you 're going to get . You do n't know if it 's going to be a little off or if it 's going to be electrifying . The only thing that 's going to stop Amy is herself . "  --  ELTON JOHN WHY HER It 's only lately that Winehouse has become as famous for her train wreck of a personal life  --  the slurred performances , the bloody paparazzi shots , the drug arrest  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brilliantly brassy voice , and not the drama , is still the star attraction . Her breakout CD , Back to Black , blending house-inspired pop and ' ' 60s-era soul , featured the prescient swinger " Rehab " and earned the 24-year-old a legion of fans ( Prince and Elton John included ) , all hoping she gets it together so that we can see what she comes up with next . Tyler Perry The new king of all media ? " He 's very creative . He 's a wonderful writer . He knows what his audience wants . It 's just a God-given thing . With each project , he 's getting better and better . He 's inspiring so many , especially those who have n't gone to film school , by saying , If you put your mind to it and your heart and you really want to do this , you can make it happen . "  --  JANET JACKSON Costar of " Why Did I Get Married ? " WHY HIM Tyler Perry may stand at an imposing 6 ' ' 5 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until now . Last June , the writer-director- actor 's half-hour TBS series House of Payne delivered the highest ratings ever for a basic-cable sitcom premiere . In October , his low-budget romantic dramedy Why Did I Get Married ? topped the box office with $21.4 million , beating competition from George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg . Now that the Atlanta-based mogul has gotten Hollywood 's attention , it 's only a matter of time before he becomes a true industry giant . Mad Men A hot new show sexes up office life in the 1960s " ' Mad Men " is like watching the History Channel , except with people screwing around . They 've been great at mimicking the time . I was just getting into the business at the end of that period and smoked three packs of cigarettes a day . People had more fun then . I 'm still doing all of the things I was doing in 1967 , and I still think someday I 'll look like Don Draper . "  --  JERRY DELLA FEMINA Chairman of ad agency Della Femina-Rothschild-Jeary and Partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's not to love ? Especially when such retro-chic fashion travels on the backs of 1960s ad execs who spend their days smoking , boozing , scheming , and sleeping around ? AMC 's drama Mad Men nails every period detail down to the political incorrectness , giving its sardonic wit ( a man refers to a woman as a " piece of fruit that went real bad real fast " ) a guilty thrill .
