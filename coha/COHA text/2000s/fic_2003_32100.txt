Chapter One YESTERDAY , I FOUND VIOLET 'S LETTERS TO BILL . THEY WERE hidden between the pages of one of his books and came tumbling out and fell to the floor . I had known about the letters for years , but neither Bill nor Violet had ever told me what was in them . What they did tell me was that minutes after reading the fifth and last letter , Bill changed his mind about his marriage to Lucille , walked out the door of the building on Greene Street , and headed straight for Violet 's apartment in the East Village . When I held the letters in my hands , I felt they had the uncanny weight of things enchanted by stories that are told and retold and then told again . My eyes are bad now , and it took me a long time to read them , but in the end I managed to make out every word . When I put the letters down , I knew that I would start writing this book today . " While I was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fourth letter , " I watched you while you painted me . I looked at your arms and your shoulders and especially at your hands while you worked on the canvas . I wanted you to turn around and walk over to me and rub my skin the way you rubbed the painting . I wanted you to press hard on me with your thumb the way you pressed on the picture , and I thought that if you did n't , I would go crazy , but I did n't go crazy , and you never touched me then , not once . You did n't even shake my hand . " I first saw the painting Violet was writing about twenty-five years ago in a gallery on Prince Street in SoHo . I did n't know either Bill or Violet at the time . Most of the canvases in the group show were thin minimalist works that did n't interest me . Bill 's painting hung alone on a wall . It was a large picture , about six feet high and eight feet long , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty room . She was propped up on one elbow , and she seemed to be looking at something beyond the edge of the painting . Brilliant light streamed into the room from that side of the canvas and illuminated her face and chest . Her right hand was resting on her pubic bone , and when I moved closer , I saw that she was holding a little taxi in that hand-a miniature version of the ubiquitous yellow cab that moves up and down the streets of New York . It took me about a minute to understand that there were actually three people in the painting . Far to my right , on the dark side of the canvas , I noticed that a woman was leaving the picture . Only her foot and ankle could be seen inside the frame , but the loafer she was wearing had been rendered with excruciating care , and once I had seen it , I kept looking back at it . The invisible woman became as important as the one who dominated the canvas . The third person was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own , but then I understood that the artist had included it in the work . The beautiful woman , who was wearing only a man 's T-shirt , was being looked at by someone outside the painting , a spectator who seemed to be standing just where I was standing when I noticed the darkness that fell over her belly and her thighs . To the right of the canvas I read the small typed card : Self-Portrait by William Wechsler . At first I thought the artist was joking , but then I changed my mind . Did that title next to a man 's name suggest a feminine part of himself or a trio of selves ? Maybe the oblique narrative of two women and a viewer referred directly to the artist , or maybe the title did n't refer to the content of the picture at all , but to its form . The hand that had painted the picture hid itself in some parts of the painting and made itself known in others . It disappeared in the photographic illusion of the woman 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the hyperrealism of the loafer . The woman 's long hair , however , was a tangle of heavy paint with forceful dabs of red , green , and blue . Around the shoe and the ankle above it , I noticed thick stripes of black , gray , and white that may have been applied with a knife , and in those dense strokes of pigment I could see the marks left by a man 's thumb . It looked as if his gesture had been sudden , even violent . That painting is here in the room with me . When I turn my head I can see it , although it too has been altered by my failing eyesight . I bought it from the dealer for $2,500 about a week after I saw it . Erica was standing only a few feet away from where I am sitting now when she first looked at the canvas . She examined it calmly and said , " It 's like looking at another person 's dream , is n't it ? " When I turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed styles and shifting focus did remind me of the distortions in dreams . The woman 's lips were parted , and her two front teeth protruded slightly . The artist had made them shiny white and a little too long , almost like an animal 's . It was then that I noticed a bruise just below her knee . I had seen it before , but at that moment its purple cast , which was yellow-green at one edge , pulled my eyes toward it , as if this little wound were really the subject of the painting . I walked over , put my finger on the canvas , and traced the outline of the bruise . The gesture aroused me . I turned to look at Erica . It was a warm September day , and her arms were bare . I bent over her and kissed the freckles on her shoulders , then lifted the hair off her neck and kissed the soft skin underneath it . Kneeling in front of her , I pushed up the material of her skirt , ran my fingers along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her knees bent slightly toward me . She pulled down her underpants , tossed them onto the sofa with a grin , and pushed me gently backward onto the floor . Erica straddled me and her hair fell forward onto my face as she kissed me . Then she sat back , pulled off her T-shirt , and removed her bra . I loved that view of my wife . I touched her breasts and let my finger circle a perfectly round mole on the left one , before she leaned over me again . She kissed my forehead and cheeks and chin and then began fumbling with the zipper of my pants . In those days , Erica and I lived in a state of almost constant sexual excitement . Just about anything could spark off a session of wild grappling on the bed , the floor , and , once , on the dining room table . Since high school , girlfriends had come and gone in my life . I had had brief affairs and longer ones , but always there had been gaps between them-painful stretches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made me a better lover-that I did n't take a woman 's body for granted . On that afternoon , however , we made love because of the painting . I have often wondered since why the image of a sore on a woman 's body should have been erotic to me . Later , Erica said that she thought my response had something to do with a desire to leave a mark on another person 's body . " Skin is soft , " she said . " We 're easily cut and bruised . It 's not like she looks beaten or anything . It 's an ordinary little black-and-blue mark , but the way it 's painted makes it stick out . It 's like he loved doing it , like he wanted to make a little wound that would last forever . " Erica was thirty-four years old then . I was eleven years older than that , and we had been married for a year . We 'd literally bumped into each other in Butler Library at Columbia . It was late on a Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had heard her steps , had felt her presence behind the dim rows of books illuminated by a timed light that gave off a low humming sound . I found the book I was looking for and walked toward the elevator . Except for the lamp , I heard nothing . I turned the corner and tripped over Erica , who had seated herself on the floor at the end of the stack . I managed to keep my footing , but my glasses sailed off my face . She picked them up , and as I bent over to take them from her , she began to stand up and her head knocked against my chin . When she looked at me , she was smiling : " A few more like that , and we might have something going-a regular slapstick routine . " I had fallen over a pretty woman . She had a wide mouth and thick dark hair cropped to her chin . The narrow skirt she was wearing had moved up her legs in our collision , and I glanced at her thighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt , she looked up at me and smiled again . During the second smile , her bottom lip quivered for an instant , and I took that small sign of nervousness or embarrassment to mean that she was susceptible to an invitation . Without it , I 'm quite sure I would have apologized again and walked away . But that momentary tremor in her lip , gone in a moment , exposed a softness in her character and offered me a glimpse of what I guessed was her carefully guarded sensuality . I asked her to have coffee with me . Coffee turned into lunch , and lunch into dinner , and the following morning I was lying next to Erica Stein in the bed of my old apartment on Riverside Drive . She was still sleeping . The light came through the window and illuminated her face and hair . Very carefully I put my hand on her head . I left it there for several minutes while I looked at her and hoped she would stay . By then we had talked for hours . It turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her parents were German Jews who left Berlin as teenagers in 1933 . Her father became a prominent psychoanalyst and her mother a voice teacher at Juilliard . The Steins were both dead . They died within months of each other the year before I met Erica , which was the same year my mother died : 1973 . I was born in Berlin and lived there for five years . My memories of that city are fragmentary , and some may be false , images and stories I shaped from what my mother told me about my early life . Erica was born on the Upper West Side , where I ended up after spending three years in a Hampstead flat in London . It was Erica who prompted me to leave the West Side and my comfortable Columbia apartment . Before we married , she told me she wanted to " emigrate . " When I asked her what she meant , she said that it was time for her to sell her parents ' apartment on West Eighty-second Street and take the long subway ride downtown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and antiseptic and hospitals and stale Sacher torte . I have to move . " Erica and I left the familiar ground of our childhoods and staked out new turf among the artists and bohemians farther south . We used the money we had inherited from our parents and moved to a loft on Greene Street between Canal and Grand . The new neighborhood with its empty streets , low buildings , and young tenants freed me from bonds I had never thought of as constraints . My father died in 1947 , when he was only forty-three years old , but my mother lived on . I was their only child , and after my father was gone , my mother and I shared his ghost . My mother grew old and arthritic , but my father remained young and brilliant and promising-a doctor who might have done anything . That anything became everything for my mother . For twenty-six years she lived in the same apartment on Eighty-fourth Street between Broadway and Riverside with my father 's missing future . Every once in a while , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as " Dr. Hertzberg " rather than " Professor , " and I would inevitably think of my father . Living in SoHo did n't erase my past or induce forgetfulness , but when I turned a corner or crossed a street , there were no reminders of my displaced childhood and youth . Erica and I were both the children of exiles from a world that has disappeared . Our parents were assimilated middle-class Jews for whom Judaism was a religion their great-grandparents had practiced . Before 1933 they had thought of themselves as " Jewish Germans , " a phrase that no longer exists in any language . When we met , Erica was an assistant professor in English at Rutgers , and I had already been teaching at Columbia in the art history department for twelve years . My degree came from Harvard , hers from Columbia , which explained why she was wandering in the stacks that Saturday morning with an alumni pass . I had fallen in love before , but in almost every case I had arrived at a moment of fatigue and boredom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperated me , but she never bored me . Erica 's comment about Bill 's self-portrait was typical of her-simple , direct , and penetrating . I never condescended to Erica . I had walked past 89 Bowery many times without ever stopping to look at it . The run-down , four-story brick building between Hester and Canal had never been more than the humble quarters of a wholesale business , but those days of modest respectability were long over by the time I arrived to visit William Wechsler . The windows of what had once been a storefront were boarded up , and the heavy metal door at street level was gouged and dented , as if somebody had attacked it with a hammer . A man with a beard and a drink in a paper bag was lounging on the single front step . He grunted in my direction when I asked him to move and then half-rolled , half-slid off the step . My first impressions of people are often clouded by what I come to know about them later , but in Bill 's case , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship . Bill had glamour-that mysterious quality of attraction that seduces strangers . When he met me at the door , he looked almost as disheveled as the man on the front step . He had a two-day beard . His thick black hair bushed out from the top and sides of his head , and his clothes were covered with dirt as well as paint . And yet when he looked at me , I found myself pulled toward him . His complexion was very dark for a white man , and his clear green eyes had an Asiatic tilt to them . He had a square jaw and chin , broad shoulders , and powerful arms . At six-two , he seemed to tower over me even though I could n't have been more than a few inches shorter . I later decided that his almost magical appeal had something to do with his eyes . When he looked at me , he did so directly and without embarrassment , but at the same time I sensed his inwardness , his distraction . Although his curiosity about me seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing from me . Bill gave off an air of autonomy so complete , it was irresistible . " I took it for the light , " he said to me when we walked through the door of the loft space on the fourth floor . Three long windows at the far end of the single room were shining with the afternoon sun . The building had sagged , which meant the back of the place was considerably lower than the front . The floor had warped as well , and as I looked toward the windows , I noticed bulges in the boards like shallow waves on a lake . The high end of the loft was spare , furnished only with a stool , a table constructed from two sawhorses and an old door , and stereo equipment , surrounded by hundreds of records and tapes in plastic milk crates . Rows of canvases had been stacked against the wall . Continues ...
