2110 A.D. Maximum security does n't even begin to describe it . <br> No one talks to the prisoner . No one enters his cell . No one sets foot in his cell-block . No one else is confined within . The guards charged with carrying out these directives stand outside the cell-block doors in powered armor . The presidential seal has been placed upon those doors . Only one man can break that seal . And he 's not taking calls . <br> The cell-block is located at the far end of one wing of a massive space station that 's the aggregation of several smaller ones , each one capable of operating autonomously should the need arise . But none of the crew have ever witnessed such a moment . Nor do they expect to . Nor , if truth be told , do they think of themselves as a crew . They consider themselves a garrison . And the space station they man is one of the largest fortresses ever built . <br> The structure is situated at L5 , the libration point that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its defenses are organized into several orbiting perimeters . Clouds of mini-sats and space mines begin a hundred klicks out . They comprise the first perimeter , stretching as close to the center as sixty klicks in places , forming a continuously shifting pattern that only those kept current with the correct routes can navigate through . <br> Fifty klicks out , the directed-energy batteries begin to appear : a variety of sats equipped with lasers , particle beams , and microwaves capable of lacerating targets at the speed of light , arranged in several layers , intended to both maximize crossfire capability and ensure maximum redundancy of hardware . Most of those weapons are optimized to hit targets in vacuum , but some of the larger ones are intended for planetary bombardment . <br> Twenty klicks out the manned defenses begin . Some are troopships designed for rapid deployment to the lunar or terrestrial theaters . Some house still more guns . Some contain the razors who defend the U.S. zone against net in-cursions . Many are just decoys , intended to eat up the enemy 's shots and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Ten klicks out are the giant slabs of rock  --  chunks of asteroids that have been towed into position to orbit L5 like fragments of some incomplete sphere . Five klicks out is the second , inner layer of slabs . Each rock has more weapons racked upon it , including more directed-energy cannons , along with rows of mass-drivers that can take advantage of a ready supply of ammunition . <br> At the center of all this sits the L5 fortress half a kilometer across . It 's manned by razors , logistics-masters , and AIs intended to direct L5 's defenses in the event of war with the Eurasian Coalition , ready to make adjustments as enemy fire degrades the libration point 's assets and enemy targets are reprioritized . Scenarios are constantly played out , assessed , and reassessed . The men and women of L5 train daily for the day of final reckoning . <br> But national security takes many forms . Not all of it involves planning for the next war . <br> Some of it involves the war that 's going on right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears the regulation uniform that everyone in American military custody wears . His cell contains no furniture , just toilet facilities and a small hatch through which food and water comes . <br> The man drinks the water , but he barely touches the food . He does n't seem to sleep either . He just sits cross-legged on the floor , staring at the locked door opposite him . <br> But then he notices a screen on the wall where there 's no screen he knew of . <br> Even as he hears a voice he thought he 'd never hear again . <br> Hacking L5 is impossible . Not just for all the usual reasons  --  interlocking firewalls , elite razors , guardian AIs , uncrackable codes , systems switching on and off randomly so that even were hostile razors to get inside they 'd still be kicked back out into the cold  --  but because of L5 's location , almost four hundred thousand kilometers away from both Earth and Moon . Any razor based at either of those points would operate at a decisive disadvantage , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L5 due to the limits of light 's speed . A razor could operate out of a spaceship closer in  --  but for that very reason L5 accepts no signal traffic that has n't traveled a certain distance . <br> All of which makes a hack on L5 almost impossible . Unless the attacking razor is based at L5 itself . <br> Or unless that razor 's something more than razor . <br> The face now appearing on the screen opposite the prisoner is that of a woman . She looks like she 's about thirty . She 's got brown hair and freckles . She looks like she 's neither slept nor smiled in a long time . <br> " Matthew Sinclair , " she says . <br> The man smiles . " Nothing 's beyond you now , " he says . <br> " You knew all along . " <br> " I 'd put it no higher than hoped . " <br> " Which does n't mean you did n't plan it . " <br> " But you 're the one who 's gone and done it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride . " I assume that the ones who watch this room are seeing the same footage they 've been too bored to watch for days now ? " <br> " It 's like I 'm not even here , " she says . " I 'm a long way out too . " <br> " Oh ? Where are you , Claire ? " <br> She smiles : right . " Right here , Matthew . " <br> " No one 's called me that since my wife died . " <br> " I did n't know you were married . " <br> " She killed herself . " <br> " I 'm sorry . " <br> " Why have you come here ? " he asks . <br> " To see you . " <br> " To learn , you mean . But I fear you 've chosen a man sadly out of every loop . You have the advantage of at least knowing that I really am Matthew Sinclair . I do n't even know if you 're really Claire . " <br> The screen changes slightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave you . And footage from within the plane Morat jacked . Taken by your ocular cameras , I presume  --  is he dead , by the way ? " <br> " Yes , " she says . " He 's dead . " <br> " Did he die well ? " <br> " Not particularly . " <br> " Did you kill him ? " <br> " Yes . " <br> " With news like that , you 're welcome here anytime . With or without those codes establishing that you 're probably Claire . But even if you 're not her , you 're still welcome to anything I have to say . I 've told the Throne everything anyway . I 'm finished , as you can see . My life is over . " <br> " Then why are you still alive ? " <br> " Because Andrew has yet to use that laser  --  the one through which you 're projecting your face  --  as a blowtorch against my head . " <br> " That 's not an answer . " <br> " That 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first name . " <br> " And I daresay I earned the privilege . I 've known him for fifty years . Long before he became president . We used to be midshipmen , you know . Back in the final days of the old navy . Back before we laid the foundations of what was to become NavCom . I remember when  --  " <br> " Do I look like I came here to listen to an old man reminiscing ? " <br> " You 'd deny me my memories ? " <br> " You denied mine . " <br> " Only so you could become what you are . " <br> " And I 'll never forgive you for it . " <br> " I do n't ask for your forgiveness , Claire . All I require is what 's beyond your power to preclude : my own recollections . The foundations of NavCom  --  I remember so well the blueprints of those ships , the likes of which the world had never seen . Floating fortresses to replace carriers . Submarines that could ride supercavitation at hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I was the nation 's chief spymaster , I often yearned for those simpler times . " <br> " Why did the Throne make you head of CICom ? " <br> " Because he and I could practically complete each other 's sentences . And because he wanted at least one source of unwavering support in the Inner Cabinet . He knew I 'd never betray him . " <br> " But you did betray him . " <br> " I was the only one who was true to him . " <br> " Is that how you rationalize it ? " <br> " He used to have such dreams , Claire . He alone understood what was required . Ironic , is n't it ? The military is acknowledged at long last as the only force that can save the country  --  and promptly finds itself undone by its own straitjacketed imagination . Only one man was capable of rising above that . Andrew Harrison opened my eyes . He showed me that the problem was n't how to win a second cold war . The problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy into goals worthy of humanity . How to solve Earth 's energy and environmental crisis once and for all . Thus the repurposing of our military machines . DTtente was a mere stepping stone along the way . Andrew 's ultimate agenda was to lay the groundwork for a new civilization . " <br> " That sounds a lot like what the Rain claimed to want . " <br> " That 's no coincidence . It 's the inevitable goal of any mind able to break free of the cage that passes for conventional thinking . The real question lies in the new world 's contours . And the Rain is precisely where Andrew went wrong . " <br> " But he created them . " <br> " No , Claire . I created them . He merely signed off on them . " <br> " And the order for their termination . " <br> " Indeed . He 'd become convinced that the elite commando unit we 'd built to hit the East 's leadership in the event of a final war was about to target him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " You know , you really are Claire . " <br> " What makes you say that ? " <br> " Because this conversation is proceeding exactly as you would conduct it . The oblique probing about the past . The gradual revealing to me of what 's going on outside this room . The gradual closing in upon the question you 're really dying to ask . " <br> " After the Throne had the Praetorians eliminate Autumn Rain , did you maintain a link to the surviving members who later downed the Elevator ? " <br> Sinclair 's mouth creases upward in something that 's well short of smile . <br> " Yes , " he says . " I did . " <br> " You 'll just come right out and admit it . " <br> " As I 've told you , I have nothing to hide . Not anymore . " <br> " So tell me why you  --  " <br> " It 's strange , Claire . We thought that the world was ours . He was president , and I was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would either defeat the East or reach accommodation with them , and then move on to greater things . But when he ordered Autumn Rain 's destruction I came up against the limitations of his vision . I saw that I had surpassed him , that he would never green-light humanity 's successors . I realized that the sooner I ruled in his place , the quicker I would be able to finish the task he started . " <br> " But you 'd already turned on him , Matthew . " <br> Continues ...
