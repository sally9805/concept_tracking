In all her years serving first with the FBI , and then the Navajo Tribal Police , Special Investigator Ella Clah had never had an office with a window -- -until now . Of course , back in her Bureau days , she 'd never even had an office -- -just a desk . Progress . <br> Budgets had grown , not due to tribal prosperity but because of an increase in violent crimes across the Navajo Nation . That had forced an expansion of their existing station and Ella , as head of their Major Crimes Unit , had landed space in their new wing . The odor of fresh paint was a constant reminder of the changes taking place in the department as was the color scheme , a palette of soft aquas , designed to relieve stress and maximize efficiency . <br> Ella swiveled in her chair , took a sip of freshly brewed coffee , and gazed at Ship Rock , the rock formation that was their town 's namesake . In actuality , the jagged rock outcropping was the eroded neck of a volcano that had formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about the huge flying monsters that had once lived there . The tale was part of every Navajo child 's education from before the first grade -- -that is , if they attended reservation schools . The story was vibrant with the richness and rhythms of the Dineh , The People 's , legends . She could almost hear her mother , Rose , telling her the tale , keeping the legends alive -- -a gift from one generation to the next . <br> The Dineh had lived in fear of the giant birds who 'd made their home on the upper levels of Ship Rock , Rose had taught her . The birds would swoop down and smash their prey against the rocks , then feed on the remains . Monster Slayer , one of the Hero Twins , was chosen to do battle with them , but when he approached their hunting ground , one of the giant birds picked him up in his talons , flew high into the skies , and dropped him , leaving him to fall on the rocks below . Expecting nothing less , Monster Slayer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life feather given to him by Spider Woman . <br> Then Monster Slayer discovered that the giant birds had young and , after he killed the male and the female , the young began to cry and plead for their lives . Monster Slayer took pity on them and , instead of killing them , he turned the older one into an eagle so he could furnish feathers for men , and the younger one into an owl so men would listen to the owl 's voice and be able to discern the future . <br> Rabbit , who was below , took some feathers from the giant bird Monster Slayer had killed and stuck them in his fur . And that 's why jackrabbits have large ears that look like giant feathers . <br> All the Dinetah , the land of the Navajos , was filled with stories about the ones who 'd come before . Every sandstone formation , pass or valley , mountain peak , and rock formation within the Four Corners and beyond echoed with the tradition of the Dineh . <br> Ella sipped her coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she made up for all those years of staring at painted cinder blocks and file cabinets instead of the blue sky and drifting white clouds . The wind was calm now , as it usually was during the early morning hours , and she intended to savor this moment of peace . By noon , or maybe even before , the gusts could start again , blowing sand and dust everywhere . <br> Gathering her thoughts , she watched the crows hop around the parking lot outside , looking for crumbs and candy wrappers that still held a hint of flavor . Just beyond them she could see two support posts of a control gate built into the bank of the irrigation ditch . Last night some would-be comedian had slipped an old pair of khaki uniform pants onto the posts , then placed shoes on the ends . At first glance it looked like an officer was headfirst in the ditch . Everyone who 'd driven past it on the way into the station had chuckled and commented about it , so it had remained in place for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by and return it to normal . <br> Finished with her coffee , she turned , hearing Justine step through the doorway . " Morning , partner , " Ella greeted . <br> Justine nodded , a somber expression on her face . " Nothing 's good about it now . Another possible carjacking went down late last night or earlier this morning . This time all hell has broken loose . " <br> " What 've we got ? " Ella said , automatically reaching for her keys as she dropped the empty foam cup into the wastebasket . <br> " We 've got a homicide too -- -a soldier who just returned home from Iraq . The officer at the scene ID 'd him . " <br> " How 'd he die ? " Ella grabbed her jacket , and was out the door before Justine had answered . <br> " Multiple gunshot wounds , according to the officer . " <br> " Do you have a ' twenty ' on this ? " she asked referring to the location of the crime as they hurried down the hall . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rattlesnake , " Justine answered . " And we 'll have to take your unit . Mine 's getting new tires . " <br> Once in the parking lot , they hurried to Ella 's unmarked vehicle , Justine taking the keys . As they pulled up to the highway and Justine braked , checking for traffic , they both heard an ominous high-pitched squeal . " It 's the dust from yesterday 's wind . Smell it in the air ? It 's starting early today too . The breeze will turn into gusts before noon today for sure and sand will fly everywhere including the brake linings again , " Ella said . " I read in the paper that the wind 's been getting up to sixty in the afternoons . I hate this kind of weather . Waves and waves of sand , pitting the windshield , settling into the brake lines , even drifting into the gun barrels . " <br> " Does n't do much for your mood , does it , partner ? " Justine observed with a wry smile . <br> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant whistling through the slightest gap in the windows and doors , the sand blasting against your skin . . . not to mention evidence flying everywhere . " <br> " Some say that Wind carries information . You just have to listen carefully , " Justine said . <br> " Now you sound like my brother . Clifford knows all the stories . It 's part of what makes him a good medicine man . He says that Wind has supporting power -- -that if I tune myself in to it , rather than become its adversary , I 'd get farther . But I still hate the taste of sand in my mouth , and since Wind puts it there . . . " <br> Justine laughed . <br> Ella turned down the volume of the police radio . Today , it was mostly static and garbled transmissions . Another of Wind 's side effects on obsolete equipment . The budget increases had targeted additional staff and facilities , not equipment , unfortunately . " What else did you get on this latest crime ? " <br> " Officer Mark Lujan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your office , " Justine answered . " He found the body down a side road near a cattle guard . It was visible from the highway . Most of the traffic this time of day goes toward town instead of away , so apparently nobody coming into work saw it across the road . Lujan was on his way west toward Beclabito . " <br> Ella nodded . " I 'm familiar with that stretch . It 's pretty desolate out there past Rattlesnake . Just a few houses here and there down toward the river , and you really have to look for them . Most are earth-toned and they blend into the landscape , except for the generic red tar paper roofs . " <br> They made a sweeping turn toward the northwest , and Ella looked up at Ute Mountain over in Colorado . " What do you have on the victim ? " <br> " The deceased lived on land that was allotted to his family . After his parents passed on , he and his brother leased sections of it . The victim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment 's hesitation . Although police officers , by and large , were modernists , most of them shared a reluctance to speak of the recently deceased by name . It was n't so much fear of the chindi , the evil in a man that stayed earthbound after death . It had more to do with respect for the Navajo cultural practices they 'd learned and followed most of their lives . Habits of a lifetime were hard to break . <br> " Officer Lujan have any help at the scene ? " Ella asked , staring at the lonely stretch of highway before them . <br> " No , but he 's doing what he can to protect the crime scene until we arrive . Lujan 's a rookie , but he 's good . He 'll handle things . And it 's not like there 's going to be a crowd there . Most of our people will go out of their way to avoid a body , " Justine said then added . " Tache , Neskahi , and the M.E. should arrive at the scene shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer Ralph Tache worked for her Special Investigations team and served as the Crime Scene Unit . Carolyn Roanhorse was a forensic pathologist , an M.D. who specialized in causes of death that related to court proceedings . Carolyn understood bullet trajectories , poisonings , and could differentiate between stab wounds and blunt injury ones . There were less than one thousand forensic pathologists in the country , but Carolyn worked exclusively for the tribe -- -an exception to the otherwise statewide authority of the N.M . Office of the Medical Investigators , headquartered in Albuquerque . <br> Carolyn had a thankless job . Since she worked with the bodies of the dead , she was virtually a pariah but , through her work , she continued to acknowledge her debt to the tribe who 'd paid for her schooling . <br> As they approached the scene , Ella immediately spotted Officer Lujan standing ramrod straight in his tan uniform by the side of the road . He 'd taken his post just outside the yellow crime-scene tape he 'd used to cordon off the area around the body . <br> Officer Lujan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had large soulful eyes . Something about his posture , lack of expression , and the almost dogged determination not to look at the body behind him telegraphed far more than the officer realized . <br> " I bet you anything this is his first actual crime-scene body , " Ella noted softly . " It 's a toss-up what he wants to do more right now -- -puke or get into his cruiser and put some serious distance between him and this place . And , if my own experience is any guide , he 's probably also wondering what other career choices he 's overlooked . " <br> They got out of the unit , and stepped over the yellow tape , which was flapping in the breeze . Office Lujan greeted them with a nod , but did n't say a word . Ella figured that he probably did n't trust his voice . She 'd been there many times -- -when the need to erupt was kept just below the surface by sheer will . Even now , some crime scenes still had the power to get to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out some cones . We 're going to expand the yellow tape perimeter out to the center stripe of the highway . Officer Lujan can redirect traffic through the far lane . I 'll call for another officer to assist . " <br> One look at the faceup , bullet-riddled corpse in the gravel along the shoulder of the road suggested that the shooter might have fired from a vehicle . That meant at least one lane , maybe both , could contain vital evidence . If necessary , they 'd close the road completely and stop traffic for as long as necessary . <br> She made the call with her cell phone , standing about fifteen feet from two obvious and separate pools of blood . The largest was beneath and around the victim , a fit-looking Navajo male with a buzz cut . He appeared to be in his early to mid-twenties and had a dozen or more bullet holes in his torso and legs . The entire area , a good one hundred feet in every direction from the body , could contain evidence . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim , in case there was another body farther from the road , still undiscovered . <br> " I know . . . knew . . . the deceased , " the officer said , his voice taut , as if someone had grabbed him by the throat . He was staring at the ground before his feet , his eyes narrowed , a sign Ella recognized . Part of him was fighting to shut out the images he 'd carry with him for the rest of his life . <br> " Do you have any idea who might have done this to him ? " Ella asked . " A local enemy ? " Soon Officer Lujan would learn to push back the screaming in his head . They all learned to do the job by getting past the insanity that shadowed their world . <br> Lujan shook his head . " I do n't know anyone here who may have wanted him dead . All I know is that he 's been serving overseas with a New Mexico National Guard transportation and supply unit . They had a welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then most of them spent several days waiting for their heavy equipment to arrive so they could drive it back to the armory in Farmington . They could n't step down until then . He was due back yesterday , " he said , then added , " His brother is a Farmington police officer . Should I call him ? " <br> " Got a phone ? " Ella asked , and Lujan nodded , reaching for a cell phone clipped to his Sam Browne belt . " Get the FPD duty officer , and have him or her relay the news . " <br> While Lujan called the Farmington PD , Justine placed some bright orange cones some distance up and down the road from the scene . Once finished , she came back to the site and crouched down by a set of tire tracks , notebook in hand . " We do n't have usable footprints , at least not in the vicinity of the body because of the gravel , and probably nowhere else as well . The wind 's already starting to gust . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't have shell casings either , assuming the victim was shot and bled out here . But there 's always the chance the shooter had a revolver , not an automatic . " <br> " The rest of our crime scene team and the M.E. should be here by now . We need to expand our search , " Ella muttered , checking her watch . " Where is everyone ? " <br> Hearing traffic , Ella looked down the highway . " Never mind . " A half minute later the tribe 's medical examiner 's vehicle pulled up , followed close behind by the even larger van used by the tribe 's Crime Scene Unit . Ella nodded to Tache and Neskahi as they climbed out , then went to greet Carolyn Roanhorse , her longtime friend . As Carolyn walked , her baggy slacks and white medical jacket got whipped about by the wind , which had increased in intensity since Ella had first arrived on the scene . <br> Carolyn had always been a large woman , but she 'd actually put on weight this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lujan , who was standing beside the yellow tape , she glared at him . " Large and in charge , and coming through . Get out of my way , son , " she barked . <br> Carolyn stepped over the tape and went directly to the body , watching the ground for any obvious evidence in her path . " Some firefight , " she said , crouching by the victim and looking closely at what appeared to be two blood trails . One led to the second pool Ella had noticed atop the asphalt . " Looks like he was n't the only one who sprung a leak , " she said . <br> " We 'll photograph everything and take samples , but we still have n't got any shell casings or rounds , except what 's probably in the victim 's body , " Ella said . " I 'll need those slugs as soon as you can part with them . Also , I need an estimated time of death . " <br> " Understood , " Carolyn said , her eyes never leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say he died not more than a few hours ago -- -around seven in the morning , give or take . There are no obvious powder burns , so whatever happened here was n't up close and personal . " As she continued to study the body and the entry wounds in particular , she added , " Wait . Two shots were up close -- -execution style -- -so forget what I said before . Both went through his heart . " Carolyn waited for Tache to take photos , then began the process of bagging the victim 's hands . <br> Ella stepped away , letting Carolyn concentrate , and took in the scene . Justine was taking samples from the blood trail , and both larger pools of blood , labeling each according to location . There was a large amount of broken safety glass scattered in cubed little clumps along the edge of the road , presumably where the driver had been shot , but that was where the similarities between this and the other carjackings they 'd had lately ended . <br> " This makes no sense . Why have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden ? " Justine asked . " Until now , they 've managed to pull off the heists by threatening their victims and manhandling them . " <br> " The carjackers probably did n't know that their latest victim was a soldier who 'd just come back from a combat zone -- -one from a unit that had been trained to be particularly wary of roadside attacks . Fighting would have come more naturally to him than surrendering , and it 's easy to understand why he might have been wound a little too tight . But this was n't a simple execution . Those heel marks on the shoulder of the road in the gravel suggest that the victim was dragged out of the vehicle to where he is now , and someone else was dragged several feet into the road , then disappeared . " <br> " So there were at least two carjackers involved in the shooting , and the victim may have wounded one of them severely enough to prevent him from making it back to their vehicle without help , " Justine said . <br> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have driven the second car away either , which means we 're talking three perps , at least , " Ella said , " which is consistent with other reports of another vehicle nearby . We need to check with area hospitals and see if they 've treated a gunshot victim . Also we need to look for that second car . Their M.O . so far has been to lure a person in by having a good-looking woman pretend to have car trouble , then having a big guy jump the good samaritan and strong-arm him or her . But this time they did n't leave the stolen junker behind , at least not in the immediate area . " <br> Justine nodded . " I 'll handle that right now . Should I also get a list of other returning soldiers from the victim 's National Guard unit , particularly those who live around here ? " <br> " Yeah . They were probably the last to see him before he drove north . " Ella continued searching for ejected shell casings . Considering the victim 's bullet-riddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find at least one . Most handguns produced and sold nowadays were semiautos and they ejected each spent casing . <br> The perps had taken the victim 's vehicle -- -that had apparently been the point of the crime . But having the foresight to pick up a dozen or more shell casings as well as the victim 's own weapon either meant that the shooters had been super cool and careful , or the murder itself had been premeditated and the victim 's vehicle a bonus . Of course that presupposed the soldier had been the real target and the rest of the operation just window dressing . If that were true , he would have had to have been followed or maybe the perps had been waiting , knowing he 'd be coming down this road at the right time . But all she had was speculation at this point and a dead soldier . <br> Neskahi was working a few feet away from her , scouring the ground adjacent to the road . " Based on the blood distribution and separate drag marks I get the idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also a small amount of shattered glass that could have come from a window on the perp 's vehicle . But if the vic 's gun is n't around , that means the perps must have taken it with them . Bad idea , if it 's legal and registered , " he said . <br> " I was just wondering about his weapon , too , " Ella said . <br> " Maybe this started as one of the usual carjackings , but then the vic recognized one of the perps , " Neskahi suggested , continuing his search pattern , his eyes still directed to the ground . <br> " That 's another good theory , " Ella said , then left him to his work . <br> Ella went to talk to Officer Lujan next , who was watching for traffic . He was trying to look rock-steady , but Ella could see the jumble of emotions in his eyes . His face remained trained into neutrality -- -an attitude that he undoubtedly hoped would pass for the coldness of a seasoned professional . <br> " You okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , but his voice trailed off at the end . <br> " Your first homicide , right ? " <br> " Yeah . " <br> " And a friend as well . That 's tough . I 've called for help to direct traffic . When it arrives , you can return to the station and write up your report . Unwind a little , maybe . " <br> " Not necessary . I can handle it . " The answer came too quickly to be genuine . <br> " You mentioned that the deceased had a brother ? " Ella said , directing the focus back to the investigation . <br> Lujan nodded . " He lives in Farmington , but he 's been keeping an eye on his brother 's place . It 's near here . " <br> " Brother 's name ? " <br> " Samuel Blacksheep , " he said , then after a pause , added , " Samuel 's going to be out for blood when he hears about this . " <br> " They were close ? " <br> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching over his kid brother . That habit may end up creating problems for the department now . Samuel wo n't want to stand back and let our PD do all the legwork . You get me ? " <br> Ella nodded , understanding precisely what he meant . An officer dedicated his life to protecting and serving the public . But when crime struck this close and involved a member of the family , the perspective twisted . Skills an officer used to protect himself and others and to make sure justice was served could easily become a tool to exact revenge . <br> " His house is over across , " Lujan said , pointing with his lips , Navajo style . " Family name 's on the mailbox . " <br> " Over across " could mean on the other side of a field , or in Albuquerque , hours away , but since he 'd pointed to an area beyond the cattle guard that apparently contained only a few houses , she 'd be able to narrow it down . " Thanks . " <br> Ella checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to check out the victim 's home , " she said , interrupting the M.E. " We do n't know yet if the perps paid a visit there as well . " <br> Carolyn nodded absently , then gestured toward the stretcher and body bag visible in the back of her open van . " I 'll need help . Get Neskahi for me before you leave . " <br> Ella gave her a bemused smile . " Still paying him back for that crack he made about you ? That was ages ago . " Contact with the dead was extremely difficult for any Navajo . Even the M.E. and the Crime Scene Unit used two sets of gloves as a precaution so that they would n't touch anything that had touched the dead . But the job no one wanted was helping the M.E. move the body . Knowing that , Carolyn always asked for Neskahi when the time came , no matter who else was around . <br> " Get him . " <br> " Okay , " Ella said , knowing the futility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years back , Neskahi had made a half-hearted joke about Carolyn 's weight and since that fateful day Carolyn had made it her mission in life to make Joseph as uncomfortable as possible at every crime scene . <br> Ella whistled , caught Neskahi 's attention , then gestured to Carolyn . Neskahi 's downcast expression as he approached spoke volumes . <br> As he walked past her , Neskahi muttered , " I even tried flowers . How long is she going to remember ? " <br> " For the rest of your life , Joe , " Ella said softly . " And do n't ever send her candy . " <br> " Come on , Sergeant , " Carolyn said with a grim smile . " Quit dragging your feet !
