1 Capella IV <p> Rebecca Greenblatt hated the fact that the Capellans were so much taller than she was . <p> Not that she minded being short in general . She 'd gotten used to it . Although she was born on Benecia , Rebecca had spent most of her childhood on Pangea , a high-gravity world . Living there stunted her growth , so she topped out at a meter and a half . When dealing with most other humanoids , this was n't too much of an issue , but on Capella the shortest native cleared two meters . <p> She 'd spent most of her time on Capella staring up nostrils . <p> This was not how she had hoped her first job as a supervisor would go . <p> Not that she was complaining . Hell , right now , she was just thrilled to be alive . Like everyone else , she saw the images on the Federation News Service of thousands of Borg cubes swarming into the Federation  --  this only seven months after a giant cube entered Earth 's solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . All things considered , it was good to be alive . <p> But it was better to be alive and to have finally made supervisor . <p> She had started working for Janus Mining as an intern while studying structural engineering at Imprek University on Tellar . A tectonic shift under one of Tellar 's oceans had led to a discovery of uridium , and Janus had gotten the contract to mine the ore for the Federation . They were eager for staff and so they trolled the universities . Mostly they hired Tellarites , but Imprek had a twenty percent population of non-Tellarites , including Rebecca , who found that her talent and background in structural engineering fit nicely with mining work . <p> Of course , she did n't do any actual structural engineering on Tellar . Janus mostly wanted people to fetch and carry and run errands , but she did well enough that she was offered a job upon graduation . <p> That was ten years ago . Last month , she was called into the office of her boss , Torvis-Urzon , at Janus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and functional , as was her boss 's office , a cramped space with no windows and a desk behind which the Grazerite barely fit . <p> " Do you recall that promotion we 'd discussed ? " Torvis-Urzon had asked without preamble as she entered . <p> Rebecca had n't been surprised by this . Torvis-Urzon had always viewed politeness as something other people did . " Yes . And I also recall that everything was on hold . " <p> " That was due to our belief that we 'd be assimilated . That is hardly a concern now . And in fact , the Borg invasion directly relates to your new job as supervisor . " <p> Her heart racing , Rebecca had said , " What new job ? " <p> " We suddenly find ourselves with a topaline shortage . So you 'll be in charge of getting some . " <p> That had made sense to Rebecca . In the wake of the Borg , the need for atmospheric domes had increased a thousandfold , and if you wanted them to work , you needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Her heart had slowed considerably . " Capella IV already has a mining operation . In fact , they 've had it for more than a century . " <p> " And in all that time , they have yet to perform an upgrade . Capella 's topaline production is about a tenth of what it would be with modern facilities . " <p> Rebecca had grinned , then . She 'd known nothing about Capella beyond that it was a trading partner with the Federation for topaline , but that was enough . She started scratching her chin . There used to be a mole there , which she 'd had removed , but it continued to itch for no good reason long after the mole that caused it had been vaporized . " And the Federation wants us to do it ? " <p> " In fact , the Federation wanted the S.C.E. to do it . " <p> " You 're kidding , " Rebecca had said with disgust . She hated those Starfleet glory hogs . <p> " Yes , but the Capellan government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " <p> " Exiled king ? " <p> Torvis-Urzon made a noise like a plasma leak , which was how Grazerites shrugged  --  or , at least , how this one did . " I know nothing of Capellan politics  --  that is simply what I was told . " <p> " Fine , then . When do I start ? " <p> He dug around the dozens of padds on his desk before finding the right one and handing it to her . " Two days . This has all the information you will require , as well as who is available for you to take . " <p> Now her heart raced again . " I can take who I want ? " <p> " Within reason , " Torvis-Urzon said . <p> Rebecca called up the list in question on the padd 's bright display . She immediately noticed that there was no list of options for the post of primary computer technician . <p> Scowling , she stared at her boss . " You 're making me take T'Lis . " <p> " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Waving the padd back and forth as if she wanted to slap Torvis-Urzon with it  --  which did n't seem like all that bad an idea , then or now  --  she said , " She creeps me out . " <p> " The translator must have malfunctioned . What did you say ? " <p> Rebecca knew damn well that the universal translator could handle that particular bit of slang , but she also knew that Torvis-Urzon hated people who conversed in slang in any language . " She makes me uncomfortable . She always stares at me like I 'm a lab experiment that 's gone horribly wrong . " <p> " Perhaps you are . " Torvis-Urzon had almost smiled at that one . <p> With a heavier sigh than the situation really warranted , Rebecca had clutched the padd and left the office , taking it to one of the hotel rooms Janus had reserved for nonlocal staff when they were on-planet . <p> Within a day , she 'd picked her team and contacted most of them . She did n't actually contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't , maybe she would n't come , and Rebecca would be able to get someone else . <p> But T'Lis did show up , along with the other one hundred and seventy-six people whose job it would be to upgrade the Capellan mining system . They went from Bre'el to Capella in one of Janus 's massive carriers , the Hecate . <p> Then she arrived at the capital of Capella and found herself looking up the nostrils of the teer . <p> In all the material on Capella she 'd read over the previous week , none of it mentioned how tall they were . <p> They were also honest to a fault . Their ritual greeting involved open hearts and open hands , and they valued the truth . The teer had said to her on arrival  --  after the greeting was complete , which put him one up on Torvis-Urzon  --  " You are welcome on Capella for as long as it takes to restore our ability to trade you for our rocks . You will be welcome for no longer than that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a priority , she threw herself into the task of upgrading Capella 's mining operations . <p> Or , as it turned out , overhauling and/or replacing them . She got a lecture from T'Lis on the subject . " These mines , " T'Lis explained , " were built in 2267 , at the height of the duotronic age . While these computers were of the best possible quality in 2267 , they are woefully antiquated by 2381 standards , as even you might imagine . " <p> Gritting her teeth at the insult but refusing to respond to it , Rebecca instead asked , " Why have n't they upgraded ? " <p> She regretted the question instantly , as the Vulcan woman gave her that damned look . " Since reading the history of Capella that came with our materials is obviously beyond your capabilities , I will tell you . While Capella did agree to a treaty with the Federation in the previous century , relations soured when a group known as the toora Maab succeeded in overthrowing the teer , a young man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's a Capellan named Leonard ? " You saw that kind of name mixing in the Federation , of course , but she would n't have expected it from snotty isolationists like the Capellans . <p> " Apparently , he was delivered by a human of that name . In any case , he and his mother were exiled and declared dead . Akaar 's tomb is in the capital city . " <p> " City . Right . " On Pangea , cities sprawled over thousands of kilometers . On Benecia , cities were built into the mountains . On Capella , what they called a " city " was a few small , poorly constructed buildings that happened to be near each other . <p> T'Lis went on . " After Akaar 's ouster , the Capellans were willing to trade with the Federation but were not willing to allow Federation technicians to perform necessary upgrades . " <p> " So as time went on , the equipment got less efficient , and trade declined . " <p> " Leading to an eventual near-collapse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken this long only because the mining equipment Starfleet installed a century ago was quite durable . Still , the Borg attack was fortuitous for the Capellans . Without the increase in topaline exports brought about by our presence here , most economists estimated the collapse of the Capellan socioeconomic infrastructure within the decade . " <p> Rebecca excused herself , wishing she had a computer technician who could have simply answered her question by saying that the stuff was old and the Capellans did n't like us enough to let us fix it . <br> <p> The next day , Rebecca was going over some reports , and called in her assistant , a Zakdorn named Jir Roplik , who had the dual advantages of being incredibly smart and efficient and being one of the few people here who was shorter than her . <p> " Why is T'Lis taking the computer core offline again ? " <p> " Because the diagnostic program works better if she takes it offline . " <p> Scratching her chin , Rebecca said , " Jir , I 've worked with computers all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ah , robust than that . " <p> " T'Lis has been experiencing problems in the changeover to isolinear systems . She says this might be the last time she has to take the core offline for this reason . " <p> " ' Might ' ? What 's the circumstance under which that 'll happen ? " <p> " The diagnostic actually functions . " <p> " You know , I was only willing to put up with her because she 's supposed to be good at this , " Rebecca said . <p> Jir blew out a breath , puffing out the folds of his cheeks . " I 'm just passing on what she said . " <p> Rebecca looked to the ceiling in supplication , but all it offered was corrugated metal . The living quarters for her people were n't complete yet . Rebecca had n't requested them to be part of the original manifest because normally on such jobs , you could stay in local housing and not have to waste time building temporary housing , which was usually dreadful in any case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap metal needed to improve a whole lot before it got as good as dreadful , and Rebecca had requested temporary housing shelters as part of the first resupply shipment from Janus . <p> Which reminded her ... " That Ferengi trader yesterday . It was a different ship from the one the first couple of weeks . " <p> " I noticed that , and asked one of the teer 's people . Apparently , that 's not unusual . The ' big-eared bringers , ' as they call them here , change ships all the time . It 's rarely the same ship more than three weeks in a row as it is . " <p> " Fine . Also , is Firee still going to be able to meet with me , or is he still pumping out the water ? " <p> " Still pumping out the water . He says they 'll be at it until midafternoon . " <p> Rebecca sighed . It had rained the previous night , and although the Capellans built their structures to withstand the elements , they had n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking the Federation out . Ironically , the meeting this morning was supposed to be about testing the drainage of the mine in case it rained . Rebecca had n't expected a practical test to be provided by nature the previous night . <p> " Greetings ! " <p> Rebecca jumped at the loud voice and turned to the entrance to her office , which was now entirely taken up by a Capellan male . He wore a blue shirt and pants with a dull yellow sash covering his waist and right shoulder , a headdress to match the shirt and pants , black boots , and a weapons belt . His hair was tied in a topknot , which stuck out through the top of the headdress . <p> Looking up his nostrils , Rebecca asked , " Can I help you ? " <p> " I was sent by the teer . I am Kuun . You are to teach me how to run your new machines . " <p> Scratching her chin almost hard enough to draw blood , Rebecca said , " I 'm sorry , Kuun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust me , training you on the mine operation is on our agenda , but it 's not finished yet . " <p> " The teer sent me now . You will teach me now . " <p> Was it Rebecca 's imagination , or was Kuun growing larger as he spoke ? Shaking the notion off , she said , " There 's nothing to teach . Right now we 've got large machines that do n't do anything and computers that do n't work properly . " <p> " Actually , " Jir said , " the refinery is scheduled to be completed today . " <p> Rebecca glowered at her assistant , hoping that her look conveyed her thought : I wish you had n't said that . " Yes , but there 's nothing to actually refine yet . " <p> Kuun folded a pair of arms that could 've been used as support struts for a Pangean building over his huge chest . " You will show me the refinery . " <p> " Tell you what . I 'm not free until after lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're free now . I told you , Firee  --  " <p> " Cancelled the meeting , right . " Rebecca had actually forgotten that . " Fine . " She rose from her desk  --  she had intended to keep it neater than Torvis-Urzon 's , at which she had failed rather spectacularly  --  and approached Kuun . " If you 'll come with me . Jir , get in touch with Yinnik and tell him to meet us at the refinery . " <p> " Of course , " Jir said with a nod . He went back to his desk  --  which was pristine , the bastard  --  while Rebecca led Kuun outside . <p> For a brief moment , she paused at the threshold and took in the view . <p> While the people were pains in the ass , and the project was hitting more snags than she was entirely comfortable with , Rebecca had to admit that this was a beautiful planet . The sun shone brightly through a sky that was crystal clear  --  no doubt due in part to the rainstorm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a messy affair , as the rain came down at a greater acceleration , and was therefore stinging and uncomfortable . It was n't until Rebecca moved to Tellar for her university studies that she realized that rain could be beautiful  --  though after a while , the sodden mess that was Tellarite weather grew wearing . <p> Here , though , the humidity had washed away , leaving a crisp , clear day . The sun shone , the trees bowed elegantly in the breeze , the distant rocks of the hills to the east glinted in the sunlight , and to the west lay the mine that her people were turning into a state-of-the-art facility that would leave that twenty-third-century anachronism that they had rotting there in the dust . <p> That was when the refinery blew up . <p> The force of the explosion pushed against Rebecca , but she did not fall . Her bones and muscles had long since grown accustomed to the pull of Pangea 's gravity , and the distant force of an explosion was not enough to uproot her . <p> The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell backward and on his rear end . <p> Knowing that Kuun would n't accept a hand up , Rebecca instead turned her attention to the refinery . Grabbing the comlink out of her pocket , she said , " Yinnik ! What happened ? You there ? " <p> " Rebecca , it 's Firee . What just happened ? " <p> She started running toward the refinery , her heavy tread making deep impressions in the Capellan dirt . " The refinery just blew up ! Emergency Procedure Four , everyone , now ! " <p> Janus Mining had procedures for almost every possible emergency , and when a new one came up , they created a new procedure for the next time . This one , though , had happened plenty of times before , though refineries usually only exploded when refining volatile materials . The problem here was that topaline was n't volatile , and even if it were , this refinery was n't active yet . <p> So what the hell happened ? <p> She put that question aside as she pulled a padd out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first part of every emergency procedure was for everyone who was able to check in to do so . <p> Of the one hundred and seventy-seven people under Rebecca 's supervision , one hundred and sixty-nine checked in . Of the remaining eight , six were Yinnik andfive of his staff , who were assigned to the refinery . One was T'Lis . What was she doing in the refinery ? <p> The other was the head of security , a native Pangean named Yevgeny Ubekov , with whom Rebecca had gone to school . In fact , she was the one who got him the job with Janus . And he 's the one who 's supposed to investigate this . Dammit . <p> By the time Rebecca arrived at the refinery , the automatic fire-suppression systems had dealt with the resultant conflagration  --  which barely had a chance to conflagrate . <p> The different section chiefs started reporting in that their sections were okay , with the obvious exception of Yinnik regarding the refinery . One of T'Lis 's assistants said the computer core was fine . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinery because Yinnik said the control consoles were n't working right . " <p> That explains that , at least , Rebecca thought as she noted the fifteen people whose job it was under E to go through the rubble and search for survivors were doing so  --  aided by Kuun , who was heaving aside rubble and debris without needing to be asked , which Rebecca appreciated . <p> Also present , but hanging back , was the doctor , a reclusive Bolian named Hruok whom Rebecca had chosen because , of all Janus 's medicos , he was the only one who 'd worked on a nonindustrial planet . <p> Hruok was holding a medical tricorder up . " I 'm not reading any life signs that are n't the rescue party here . " He looked down at Rebecca with sad eyes . " I 'm afraid this is recovery , not rescue . " <p> " Then I 'll need autopsies , " Rebecca said , trying to remember the security procedures . This is what I had Yevgeny for . " And we 'll scan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confusion . " Explosives ? " <p> " The refinery was n't operating yet , Doctor . And we 're on a planet full of people with a history of disdain for the Federation . If Yevgeny was here , that 'd be the first thing he 'd check . " I hope . <p> Then she got on the comlink . " Jir , contact Torvis-Urzon on the emergency hyperlink and fill him in . " <p> " Of course . " <p> Hruok was back to staring at his tricorder . " I 'm picking up Vulcan DNA traces right under where that big person is . " <p> Kuun started digging more thoroughly , yanking out a very large piece of twisted metal that was stained green . <p> Under it was T'Lis 's body . The last thing I thought about her was unkind . Rebecca felt awful about that , more so when she realized that all her thoughts about T'Lis had been unkind . <p> One of the engineers , a human named Hugues Staley , walked up to Rebecca . He was holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugues lovedto take Starfleet surplus and play with it . " Rebecca , I just ran a scan . There 's an element that should n't be here  --  it is n't indigenous to Capella , and it 's not in anything we use . " <p> " What is it ? " <p> " Cabrodine . " <p> Hugues was speaking as if that would mean something to Rebecca . " Hugues , my last chemistry class was ten years ago , and I 've never been involved with mining cabrodine , which is honestly the only way I learn about elements and minerals . " <p> " Well , cabrodine has a bunch of uses , and it 's possible that the explosion caused a chemical reaction that created it , but ... " <p> When Hugues 's pause threatened to go on for five seconds , Rebecca prompted him . " But what ? " <p> " It 's also a common ingredient of explosives . " <p> Hruok swallowed . " So we 're back to sabotage . " <p> " Maybe . " Rebecca hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jir , have you gotten through to Torvis-Urzon yet ? " <p> " Shroya 's looking for him right now . " <p> Rebecca did some quick calculations in her head , belatedly realizing that it was late in the evening in Bre'el IV 's capital city . Torvis-Urzon was notoriously difficult to reach once regular business hours concluded . <p> " Okay , keep me posted . " <p> Looking down at the remains of the refinery as they dug up two more bodies  --  including that of Yevgeny  --  Rebecca thought , This is not how I had hoped my first job as a supervisor would go . , and 2009 by CBS Studios Inc . <br> Continues ...
