Mars has not been kind to NASA lately . It was only three years ago that the Pathfinder rover toddled across the planet , beaming home the best cosmic photo album ever assembled . Last year , however , the space agency 's Mars program fell flat , when two other spacecraft failed en route to the planet without collecting a scrap of data . Now NASA is trying again . Last week the space agency announced plans to send a pair of souped-up rovers to Mars in 2003 and this time  --  via the Internet  --  to take Earthlings along . <P> The Pathfinder rover was a modest machine : 1 ft. tall and so slow it covered only 100 yds. of terrain in its 90-day life-span . By comparison , the new Mars cars are hot rods . Each will weigh 330 lbs. , stand 4 ft. high and cover 100 yds. in a day . The rovers will bristle with 10 cameras as well as a robotic arm , able to conduct microscopic studies of rocks . <P> Hardware this snazzy does not come cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $600 million . NASA insists it is money well spent . Mission analysts have concluded that one reason for last year 's failures may have been that NASA chief Dan Goldin 's " better , faster , cheaper " policy may have got too cheap and cut too many corners . <P> In order to keep the public involved , every minute of the missions will be beamed to a NASA website , where a rover's-eye view of Mars will be available . NASA does n't know yet just what part of the planet 's surface viewers will see when they log on , but plans call for sending the rovers to spots where water may once have flowed  --  and life might once have appeared . No matter what the robots discover , for now , NASA is relieved that the Mars program is once again showing its own signs of life . <P>  --  By Jeffrey Kluger
