Star Wars Darth Bane Path of Destruction A Novel of the Old Republic By Drew Karpyshyn Del Rey Drew Karpyshyn Dessel was lost in the suffering of his job , barely even aware of his surroundings . His arms ached from the endless pounding of the hydraulic jack . Small bits of rock skipped off the cavern wall as he bored through , ricocheting off his protective goggles and stinging his exposed face and hands . Clouds of atomized dust filled the air , obscuring his vision , and the screeching whine of the jack filled the cavern , drowning out all other sounds as it burrowed centimeter by agonizing centimeter into the thick vein of cortosis woven into the rock before him . Impervious to both heat and energy , cortosis was prized in the construction of armor and shielding by both commercial and military interests , especially with the galaxy at war . Highly resistant to blaster bolts , cortosis alloys supposedly could withstand even the blade of a lightsaber . Unfortunately , the very properties that made it so valuable also made it extremely difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take days to burn away even a small section of cortosis-laced rock . The only effective way to mine it was through the brute force of hydraulic jacks pounding relentlessly away at a vein , chipping the cortosis free bit by bit . Cortosis was one of the hardestmaterials in the galaxy . The force of the pounding quickly wore down the head of a jack , blunting it until it became almost useless . The dust clogged the hydraulic pistons , making them jam . Mining cortosis was hard on the equipment ... and even harder on the miners . Des had been hammering away for nearly six standard hours . The jack weighed more than thirty kilos , and the strain of keeping it raised and pressed against the rock face was taking its toll . His arms were trembling from the exertion . His lungs were gasping for air and choking on the clouds of fine mineral dust thrown up from the jack 's head . Even his teeth hurt : the rattling vibration felt as if it were shaking them loose from his gums . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cortosis they brought back . If he quit now , another miner would jump in and start working the vein , taking a share of the profits . Des did n't like to share . The whine of the jack 's motor took on a higher pitch , becoming a keening wail Des was all too familiar with . At twenty thousand rpm , the motor sucked in dust like a thirsty bantha sucking up water after a long desert crossing . The only way to combat it was by regular cleaning and servicing , and the Outer Rim Oreworks Company preferred to buy cheap equipment and replace it , rather than sinking credits into maintenance . Des knew exactly what was going to happen next-and a second later , it did . The motor blew . The hydraulics seized with a horrible crunch , and a cloud of black smoke spit out the rear of the jack . Cursing ORO and its corporate policies , Des released his cramped finger from the trigger and tossed the spent piece of equipment to the floor . " Move aside , kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other miners , stepped up and tried to shoulder Des out of the way so he could work the vein with his own jack . Gerd had been working the mines for nearly twenty standard years , and it had turned his body into a mass of hard , knotted muscle . But Des had been working the mines for ten years himself , ever since he was a teenager , and he was just as solid as the older man-and a little bigger . He did n't budge . " I 'm not done here , " he said . " Jack died , that 's all . Hand me yours and I 'll keep at it for a while . " " You know the rules , kid . You stop working and someone else is allowed to move in . " Technically , Gerd was right . But nobody ever jumped another miner 's claim over an equipment malfunction . Not unless he was trying to pick a fight . Des took a quick look around . The chamber was empty except for the two of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise ; Des usually chose caverns far off the main tunnel network . It had to be more than mere coincidence that Gerd was here . Des had known Gerd for as long as he could remember . The middle-aged man had been friends with Hurst , Des 's father . Back when Des first started working the mines at thirteen , he had taken a lot of abuse from the bigger miners . His father had been the worst tormentor , but Gerd had been one of the main instigators , dishing out more than his fair share of teasing , insults , and the occasional cuff on the ear . Their harassments had ended shortly after Des 's father died of a massive heart attack . It was n't because the miners felt sorry for the orphaned young man , though . By the time Hurst died , the tall , skinny teenager they loved to bully had become a mountain of muscle with heavy hands and a fierce temper . Mining was a tough job ; it was the closest thing to hard labor outside a Republic prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Des just happened to become the biggest of them all . Half a dozen black eyes , countless bloody noses , and one broken jaw in the space of a month was all it took for Hurst 's old friends to decide they 'd be happier if they left Des alone . Yet it was almost as if they blamed him for Hurst 's death , and every few months one of them tried again . Gerd had always been smart enough to keep his distance-until now . " I do n't see any of your friends here with you , old man , " Des said . " So back off my claim , and nobody gets hurt . " Gerd spat on the ground at Des 's feet . " You do n't even know what day it is , do you , boy ? Kriffing disgrace is what you are ! " They were standing close enough to each other that Des could smell the sour Corellian whiskey on Gerd 's breath . The man was drunk . Drunk enough to come looking for a fight , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago today , " Gerd said , shaking his head sadly . " Five years ago today your own father died , and you do n't even remember ! " Des rarely even thought about his father anymore . He had n't been sorry to see him go . His earliest memories were of his father smacking him . He did n't even remember the reason ; Hurst rarely needed one . " Ca n't say I miss Hurst the same way you do , Gerd . " " Hurst ? " Gerd snorted . " He raised you by himself after your mama died , and you do n't even have the respect to call him Dad ? You ungrateful son-of-a-Kath-hound ! " Des glared down menacingly at Gerd , but the shorter man was too full of drink and self-righteous indignation to be intimidated . " Should 've expected this from a mudcrutch whelp like you , " Gerd continued . " Hurst always said you were no good . He knew there was something wrong with you ... Bane . " Des narrowed his eyes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by that name when he was drunk . Bane . He had blamed his son for his wife 's death . Blamed him for being stuck on Apatros . He considered his only child to be the bane of his existence , a fact he 'd tended to spit out at Des in his drunken rages . Bane . It represented everything spiteful , petty , and mean about his father . It struck at the innermost fears of every child : fear of disappointment , fear of abandonment , fear of violence . As a kid , that name had hurt more than all the smacks from his father 's heavy fists . But Des was n't a kid anymore . Over time he 'd learned to ignore it , along with all the rest of the hateful bile that spilled from his father 's mouth . " I do n't have time for this , " he muttered . " I 've got work to do . " With one hand he grabbed the hydraulic jack from Gerd 's grasp . He put the other hand on Gerd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inebriated man caught his heel on a rock and fell roughly to the ground . He stood up with a snarl , his hands balling into fists . " Guess your daddy 's been gone too long , boy . You need someone to beat the sense back into you ! " Gerd was drunk , but he was no fool , Des realized . Des was bigger , stronger , younger ... but he 'd spent the last six hours working a hydraulic jack . He was covered in grime and the sweat was dripping off his face . His shirt was drenched . Gerd 's uniform , on the other hand , was still relatively clean : no dust , no sweat stains . He must have been planning this all day , taking it easy and sitting back while Des wore himself out . But Des was n't about to back down from a fight . Throwing Gerd 's jack to the ground , he dropped into a crouch , feet wide and arms held out in front of him . Gerd charged forward , swinging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught the punch with the open palm of his left hand , absorbing the force of the blow . His right hand snapped forward and grabbed the underside of Gerd 's right wrist ; as he pulled the older man forward , Des ducked down and turned , driving his shoulder into Gerd 's chest . Using his opponent 's own momentum against him , Des straightened up and yanked hard on Gerd 's wrist , flipping him up and over so that he crashed to the ground on his back . The fight should have ended right then ; Des had a split second where he could have dropped his knee onto his opponent , driving the breath from his lungs and pinning him to the ground while he pounded Gerd with his fists . But it did n't happen . His back , exhausted from hours of hefting the thirty-kilo jack , spasmed . The pain was agonizing ; instinctively Des straightened up , clutching at the knotted lumbar muscles . It gave Gerd a chance to roll out of the way and get back to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . His back howled in protest , and he grimaced as red-hot daggers of pain shot through his body . Gerd saw the grimace and laughed . " Cramping up there , boy ? You should know better than to try and fight after a six-hour shift in the mines . " Gerd charged forward again . This time his hands were n't fists , but claws grasping and grabbing at anything they could find , trying to nullify the younger man 's height and reach by getting in close . Des tried to scramble out of the way , but his legs were too stiff and sore to get him clear . One hand grabbed his shirt , the other got hold of his belt as Gerd pulled both of them to the ground . They grappled together , wrestling on the hard , uneven stone of the cavern floor . Gerd had his face buried against Dessel 's chest to protect it , keeping Des from landing a solid elbow or head-butt . He still had a grip on Des 's belt , but now his other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Des 's face would be . Des was forced to wrap his arms in and around Gerd 's own , interlocking them so neither man could throw a punch . With their limbs pinned , strategy and technique meant little . The fight had become a test of strength and endurance , with the two combatants slowly wearing each other down . Dessel tried to roll Gerd over onto his back , but his weary body betrayed him . His limbs were heavy and soft ; he could n't get the leverage he needed . Instead it was Gerd who was able to twist and turn , wrenching one of his hands free while still keeping his face pressed tight against Des 's chest so it would n't be exposed . Des was n't so lucky ... his face was open and vulnerable . Gerd struck a blow with his free hand , but he did n't hit with a closed fist . Instead he drove his thumb hard into Des 's cheek , only a few centimeters from his real target . He struck again with the thumb , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave him blind and writhing in pain . It took Des a second to realize what was happening ; his tired mind had become as slow and clumsy as his body . He turned his face away just as the second blow landed , the thumb jamming painfully into the cartilage of his upper ear . Dark rage exploded inside Des : a burst of fiery passion that burned away the exhaustion and fatigue . Suddenly his mind was clear , and his body felt strong and rejuvenated . He knew what he was going to do next . More importantly , he knew with absolute certainty what Gerd would do next , too . He could n't explain how he knew ; sometimes he could just anticipate an opponent 's next move . Instinct , some might have said . Des felt it was something more . It was too detailed-too specific-to be simple instinct . It was more like a vision , a brief glimpse into the future . And whenever it happened , Des always knew what to do , as if something was guiding and directing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ready for it . He could picture it perfectly in his mind . He knew exactly when it was coming and precisely where it would strike . This time he turned his head in the opposite direction , exposing his face to the incoming blow-and opening his mouth . He bit down hard , his timing perfect , and his teeth sank deep into the dirty flesh of Gerd 's probing thumb . Gerd screamed as Des clamped his jaw shut , severing the tendons and striking bone . He wondered if he could bite clean through and then-as if the very thought made it happen-he severed Gerd 's thumb . The screams became shrieks as Gerd released his grasp and rolled away , clasping his maimed hand with his whole one . Crimson blood welled up through the fingers trying to stanch the flow from his stump . Standing up slowly , Des spat the thumb out onto the ground . The taste of blood was hot in his mouth . His body felt strong and reenergized , as if some great power surged through his veins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Des could do anything he wanted to Gerd now . The older man rolled back and forth on the floor , his hand clutched to his chest . He was moaning and sobbing , begging for mercy , pleading for help . Des shook his head in disgust ; Gerd had brought this on himself . It had started as a simple fistfight . The loser would have ended up with a black eye and some bruises , but nothing more . Then the older man had taken things to another level by trying to blind him , and he 'd responded in kind . Des had learned long ago not to escalate a fight unless he was willing to pay the price of losing . Now Gerd had learned that lesson , too . Des had a temper , but he was n't the kind to keep beating on a helpless opponent . Without looking back at his defeated foe , he left the cavern and headed back up the tunnel to tell one of the foremen what had happened so someone could come tend to Gerd 's injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medics could reattach Gerd 's thumb , so at worst Des would be fined a day or two 's wages . The corporation did n't really care what its employees did , as long as they kept coming back to mine the cortosis . Fights were common among the miners , and ORO almost always turned a blind eye , though this particular fight had been more vicious than most-savage and short , with a brutal end . Just like life on Apatros . ( Continues ... ) by Drew Karpyshyn
