<p> Do n't you hate it when young rabble-rousers become hypocritical old men ? I remember many times when Scott Skiles , an opinionated party animal back in the day , spoke freely about basketball and life . He once peppered a teammate named Shaquille O'Neal with enough well-placed insults  --  a " p  --  , " he reportedly called Shaq  --  that the two nearly came to blows while wrestling on a practice court . <p> So why was Skiles peeved Wednesday after rookie Joakim Noah , such a free spirit that he criticized President Bush 's war policies before reluctantly visiting the White House , issued an honest commentary about the woes of the 0-4 Bulls ? I also should mention it was an accurate take about a soft , distracted , defensively listless team that is shooting 37 percent , averaging 87 points and still looks mired in a post-Kobe Bryant hangover . <p> " I think everyone is , like , in their own world a little bit , " offered Noah , who was mentioned with other Bulls last week in Kobe trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on defense , has to be in unison . We have to be tougher . We did n't do that . ... You 're gon na have bad shooting nights . You have to find a way to still win ballgames . That 's what championship teams do  --  they find a way to grind things out . Teams are getting anything they want on us . " <p> The assessment was as refreshing as it was dead-on . On a team of nice , quiet , introverted players who have been shaken by the business side of pro basketball , these were just the potent words one would expect from , well , the coach . But oddly , Skiles did n't embrace Noah 's statements . He assailed them , which contradicts the very leadership style Skiles exhibited as a player . I really do n't care that Noah was speaking after his NBA regular-season debut . The truth is the truth , even from the mouth of a babe , and Skiles should have embraced it instead of reacting like an offended dictator . Seems a tough-minded coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every direction , including his own locker room . <p> THERE 'S NO ONE TO SPEAK UP <p> " I do n't know . If I had just played my first pro game , I 'd probably have kept my mouth shut , to be honest with you , " Skiles fired back . " It 's obvious we 're not playing to our ability , there 's no doubt about that . I may have a little problem with the phrasing of that , but the point is probably spot-on . Again , it probably should have been someone else speaking for the group . " <p> But who , Scott ? Kirk Hinrich ? He 's too busy complaining to the officials . Ben Gordon ? He 's too deaf hearing his jump shots clank off iron . Ben Wallace ? He 's probably busy making lunch plans again with his former teammates , the Detroit Pistons . Luol Deng ? Too quiet . Andres Nocioni ? Too crazy . <p> This is a team with serious internal problems right now . Known for their heart and hustle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the team they were the last two springs . When general manager John Paxson talked to the Lakers about a Bryant deal , he should have realized the unsettling impact it might have on his younger stars . Deng and Gordon , in particular , rejected $50 million extensions last week , clouding their heads about their suddenly uncertain futures in Chicago . Deng , a centerpiece in all Bryant trade discussions , knows the rumors will continue because , " You can tell Kobe does n't want to be in L.A. " The trademark unity is gone , replaced by the reality that Hinrich may have topped out as an NBA player , Wallace is looking disinterested and old and Gordon is not a go-to man in the clutch . Tuesday , while the Bulls were missing seven straight shots in crunch time , Cuttino Mobley and local native Corey Maggette were drilling big shots for a Clippers team playing without Elton Brand . <p> " Corey would love to be a Bull , " Maggette 's mother said on the game telecast . <p> A free agent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything Paxson has at present . I 'm not certain what Mad Pax was doing all summer , but while the Celtics were acquiring a superstar in Kevin Garnett and the Grizzlies were leaving Pau Gasol on the trading block , the Bulls landed journeyman Joe Smith . If Bryant is n't available , they should aggressively pursue Gasol to at least fill their other major need : a low-post scoring threat . <p> Fact is , the Bulls are n't talented enough to slop through November . Nor do they have the right to dog it , having accomplished nothing beyond a six-game defeat in the Eastern Conference semifinals . They were teased last May by the Pistons , who are off to a 3-0 start and are motivated to prove they still belong in conference title talk . No longer are the Bulls given slack as charming overachievers . The new expectations have them challenging for a spot in the NBA Finals , which prompted management to raise the average season-ticket price a whopping 15.3 percent to $63 . That 's fourth in the league , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $89.24 ) , Knicks ( $70.51 ) and Celtics ( $65.43 ) . <p> Last I looked , Noah has celebrated more championships lately than the other Bulls . He won two at Florida , bypassing the 2006 draft and immediate riches to win back-to-back NCAA titles . When Paxson drafted him , he said he welcomed Noah 's quotability . It did n't take long for Skiles to object . Asked at practice about the coach 's reaction to his comments , Noah at first was taken aback before catching himself . " I just felt that we did n't play in sync . Is that ... I do n't want to say anything . I do n't have a problem with coach Skiles . OK , if he feels that way , then I 'll shut up , " he said . <p> HE 'S JUST BEING WHO HE IS <p> So much for Noah providing the best sideshow at the United Center since Dennis Rodman . What was Skiles expecting , anyway ? This is the fun-loving kid who looked like a clown on draft night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wild-flying hair . This is the lightning rod who blew kisses to UCLA cheerleaders , pushed a pompon toward the face of a Kentucky cheerleader and sparred with enemy fans who chanted , " No-ah 's Ug-ly ! " He 's going to say things . <p> And he 's going to say things that are right , as Skiles finally got around to echoing . <p> " Why do we all look so funny in the face ? " the coach said of his team . " Why do we look so strange ? Why do n't we even look like ourselves ? It 's easy to say there were distractions in training camp . Well , there are always distractions on every team . If we 're going to give in to those kind of things , then that tells us something . "
