This study is motivated by the issues created by end-user computing ( EUC ) and its growing importance within organizations . One of the major issues related to EUC is training individuals to adopt to the new technology . As a result , both researchers and practitioners are challenged to find new ways to train end users . In response to this challenge , researchers have studied key variables such as training support and delivery , techniques , and individual differences that can be manipulated to enhance training program design . <p> There is a critical need for computer literacy and aptitude due to the pervasiveness of computers in the workplace , massive investments in computing technology by corporations and subsequent impact on return on investment , and the dynamic nature of information systems ( IS ) technology change . More specifically organizations are concerned about the long-term effect of training on individual performance . The study reports the result of longitudinal study conducted in an industrial setting . <p> Corporate management is frequently more interested in training as opposed to education . Training is an activity related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand formal education is preparation for a defined profession . Since formal Information Technology ( IT ) education often lags the needs of industry , corporations must find new ways of providing training to keep abreast of advancing IT . Corporations use various ways to train their employees such as instructor-based training ( IBT ) , Computer-Based Training ( CBT ) , and video training . The first author of this study conducted a field experiment to evaluate the impact of IBT versus CBT on employees ' performance . The findings indicated that the major difference between IBT and CBT subjects were attributed to the performance , enrollment for the classes , motivation and general attitude toward training method , and satisfaction with the facility . A key issue the research identified was that it is difficult to sell the CBT method as a formal training tool to employees . Field Experiment <p> To determine the importance of selected key variables in successful training programs a field experiment was conducted in a corporate setting . Key variables studied were the training methods and task . The training methods used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBT ) . Tasks selected for the study were Word for Windows and Excel 5.0 . The target population for this study was the end-users of information systems technology . The subjects ( sample ) for this study were employees of a Fortune 100 corporation located in a major southwestern city in the United States . The corporation is a major producer of semiconductor , defense systems , and information technology products . The corporate management requires all levels of its employees to take training pertaining the use of information technology applications software . The study included both hourly and salaried employees  --  assembly line workers , administrative clerks , technicians , engineers , as well as managers . The study included employees who were required to or who want to learn new software packages . Because of privacy and ethics concerns , the subjects ' anonymity was preserved . The reason for using the corporate employees in the experiment was to strengthen the external validity of the study . The subjects selected for this study were all novices . Subjects were allowed to select training classes based on the training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a formal entity of the corporation that employs qualified trainers and staff . The training center offers technical as well as non-technical training to the employees year-around . Employees sign up for the training depending upon their workloads and the classes offered by the training center . A self-selecting and convenience sample was employed in this study . <p> Procedure <p> Each subject was asked to sign a letter of consent stating that participating in the experiment is voluntary . Subjects could drop out of the experiment at any time they wished . Subjects were grouped in four groups - IBT ( Word ) , IBT ( Excel ) , CBT ( Word ) , and CBT ( Excel ) . IBT and CBT contents were similar and were designed to follow similar sequence of topics . <p> The IBT approach used a combined traditional training , stand-up lecture and the hands-on exploratory method . The CBT approach was similar to the IBT approach except for the absence of an instructor . Thus , in CBT there is no direct interaction between the subject and an instructor . In CBT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBT was a commercially available purchased software package and not custom developed for the experiment . CBT software for Microsoft Word ( Ver . 6.0 ) and Excel ( Ver . 5.0 ) were loaded on the computer system . Unlike IBT subjects , CBT subjects were not provided with a training manual . They were required to follow a series of actions displayed by the CBT software . No instructor was present to answer any software-related questions . The only time subjects were assisted was when the system required maintenance or the students had difficulties other than training related . <p> Measurement Procedure <p> There were several measures included in this study . These measurements were taken at various time intervals such as at the beginning of the training , at the end of the training , and one-month after training . <p> Demographic data on each subject were collected at the beginning of the experiment . Demographic data included subjects ' gender , present use of software , current job functions , work experience , computer experience , and education . Demographic data were used in assessing the prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance ) <p> Administering the set of questions on Microsoft Word and Excel software concepts respectively made a knowledge assessment of each subject . The subjects were tested using the same test questions at the beginning of training , at the end of training , and approximately one month after training . At each interval of training , subjects ' scores on the tests were recorded . Measuring the subjects ' performance after a one-month period was useful in determining the lasting nature of learning that each training approach provides . Recording the subjects ' performance also determined the extent that the subjects were able to retain their learning . This measure is a surrogate for the amount of learning that will transfer to the workplace . Individual performance measures included ability to recall key commands , number of errors , and ability to correctly identify conceptual facts about the software . The questions in the instruments were grouped into four categories-menu , icon , control , and exhibit . In the menu category , subjects were asked to pick an appropriate menu item for a specific question . The icon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asked to indicate the appropriate icon . The control category included questions mostly related to the page up , cursor movements , and so forth . An exhibit category was created for answering the questions related to the actual output display of the Microsoft Word 6.0 and Excel 5.0 software . Menu , icon , and exhibit questions were related to the functionality of the software package ( e.g. , file , save , print , etc . ) . It was anticipated that the subjects ' performance might vary in each category depending on their preference for each category . <p> Qualitative performance ( end-user computing satisfaction ) <p> Several individual satisfaction measures were used and included general attitude toward using the software in the future , perceived importance of training , ease of use , overall satisfaction with the trainer and training content , and satisfaction with the facility . The end-user computing satisfaction instrument was used to measure individual satisfaction . <p> The overall results indicated CBT training to be more effective than IBT , which implies that corporations should consider CBT as a pan of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy of the subjects one-month-after-training versus end-of-training . However , several reasons explain why CBT subjects performed significantly better than IBT subjects did . The average education level of CBT subjects was at least college undergraduate or better . Approximately 38% of the CBT subjects were postgraduates and 38% were graduates . Among the IBT subjects , 42% were high school graduates , 26.6% were undergraduates , 14.4% graduates , 1% postgraduate , and 15.5% had other education . Seventy-one percent of the CBT subjects and 38.8% of the IBT subjects used Microsoft Word or Excel before the training . Thus , the higher level of education and use of Word or Excel may explain why the CBT subjects performed better than IBT subjects did . During the course of this study , it was observed that the enrollment for CBT classes was much lower than that for the IBT classes . IBT and CBT classes were announced several times each month to increase enrollment , but the employees preferred IBT . The ratio of IBT to CBT participation in the study was approximately 4.3 to 1 . This clearly indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees prefer the presence of an instructor in a classroom ( this could be a reflection of subjects ' familiarity with the training environment ) . Participation of CBT subjects may imply that they are self-starters and prefer self-paced training . <p> We also examined the impact of training task ( Microsoft Word or Excel ) on the subjects ' performance accuracy and satisfaction at the end-of-training and a month-after-training of all IBT and CBT subjects combined , using training task as a factor with two levels , Microsoft Word and Excel . <p> The employees ' performance data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA test and employees ' satisfaction data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests at a significance level of 5% . The analysis indicated that Excel training was more effective ( p-value = 0.005 ) in longer retention of learning than Microsoft Word training . The rationale for this difference was that 70% of Excel subjects used Excel after the training compared to 51% of Microsoft Word subjects who used Microsoft Word after the training . However , the subjects ' satisfaction was not significantly different for Excel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on immediate and long- term training outcomes . <p> The mean performance of Microsoft Word task was 13.17 versus the mean performance of Excel task at 16.59 . These scores are the average differences between the pre-training and end-of-training performance measures . The analysis indicated that there was no difference in accuracy at the pre-training and at the end-of-training between subjects receiving word processing training and the subjects receiving spreadsheet training ( p-value = 0.302 ) . <p> The net gain in mean performance of the Microsoft Word task one-month-after training was 12.68 versus the mean performance of the Excel task was 20.30 . Thus , the training was more effective ( p-value = 0.025 ) for the Excel program than for the Microsoft Word program . The number of subjects who used Microsoft Word or Excel during the period of one-month-after-training is demonstrated . The results indicate that 71% of Excel subjects used Excel during the period whereas 51% of Microsoft Word subjects used Microsoft Word during the same period . These results explain why training seemed more effective for the Excel subjects than Microsoft Word subjects . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lower one-month-after the training than at the end-of-training . Thus , it was concluded that the use of software after the training increases the retention of learning . The results demonstrated that use of training task after training results in longer retention . When the net gain in performance at the end-of-training and one month after training were compared , the results were not statistically significant ( p-value = 0.11 ) . However , the average mean score was lower for Microsoft Word subjects compared to Excel subjects . Conclusion <p> The findings indicated that the major differences between IBT and CBT subjects were attributed to the performance , enrollment for the classes , motivation and general attitude toward training method , and satisfaction with the facility . Motivation or attitude were not measured but interpreted based on the general comments made by the subjects and the proportion of IBT enrollment versus CBT enrollment . The CBT subjects ' overall end-of-training and one-month-after-training performance was significantly better than IBT subjects ' performance . However , a key issue the research identified was that it is difficult to sell the CBT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another implication of this research for the training manager concerns the long-term learning effect of training . If corporate leaders can correctly identify the employees who need training and who would apply the training immediately , then the result would be a cost savings by not training the employees who do not have a need to use the training material . Training managers may also need to consider the learning styles of trainees ( Bohlen and Ferratt 1997 ) . CBT may be used as a timely way to deliver a preliminary round of training before a trainee uses an IBT ( Paul 1997 ; Filipczak 1997 ) . It was determined by the research that CBT is an effective means of training ; however , its acceptance as a formal training tool was not favorable . CBT programs are beginning to take center stage among retailers who credit CBT with reducing costs , strengthening relations , increasing employee retention and boosting the bottom line ( Janoff 1999 , Schultz 1998 ) . Training managers need to critically evaluate the software interface while selecting CBT . Training managers may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical to end-users in effectively using the CBT ( Paul 1997 ) . Tips to working with CBT vendors are available ( Gordon 1998 ) . This calls for a close partnership between the managers and developers to sell CBT to end-users . <p> The first author would like to express his appreciation to his dissertation chair , Dr. J.
