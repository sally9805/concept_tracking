<p> COLORADO SPRINGS - Dave Hughes has stood where others have , and behaved differently . <p> A 1950 graduate of West Point , Hughes has left his footprints - and the gifts of his personality and genius - around the world . <p> Next month , the 75-year-old Colorado Springs native will travel back to West Point to be honored as one of the U.S. Military Academy 's distinguished graduates . <p> Hughes will review 4,000 cadets , have a medal hung around his neck , and have his portrait hung in Eisenhower Hall , next to the academy 's other esteemed winners : generals Alexander Haig , Norman Schwartzkopf , William Westmoreland , and Philippine President Fidel Ramos . <p> When his friends decided to nominate the Stetson-wearing maverick for the award , they assembled paperwork 4 inches thick on Hughes ' accomplishments . <p> In 1951 , Hughes won a chestful of medals in Korea , more than any other officer in his West Point class . <p> At Fort Carson in the early ' 70s , he painted the post 's barber shop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After the Army , he helped revitalize Old Colorado City , a historic district west of Colorado Springs . He became a pioneer in information technology , one of the world 's experts on bringing broadband networking to the world 's most remote areas . <p> Hughes linked 114 one-room schoolhouses in Montana so they could be connected to the rest of the world - one of the first ' distance learning ' networks ever established . He helped Mongolian schoolchildren connect to the Internet and designed a cybercafe partway up Mount Everest . <p> ' He has a universal personality . Wherever he goes , he blends in well with the total culture , ' said John Robert Flynn of Denver , who served as Hughes ' commander in Korea . ' He does n't do it for ambitious reasons , he does it for mankind . He knows he 's helping someone and improving their lot , instead of talking like politicians do and never getting anything done . <p> ' He has equanimity in personality and demeanor , what makes him uniquely qualified for battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown and undiscovered , ' Flynn said . <p> When Flynn 's roommate at West Point , now Lt. Gen. John Cushman , called Hughes in January to tell him of the award , Cushman 's first question was : ' Are you going to wear your Stetson ? ' <p> Hughes said he has n't decided , but if West Point 's superintendent asks him to remove his signature hat , he 'll probably agree . <p> ' Now I 'll have to behave . Now I 'm part of the establishment , ' he said . ' But I just do n't particularly want to change myself at this age . ' <p> Hughes grew up in the 1200 block of Wood Avenue in Colorado Springs and went to West Point in 1945 . <p> Months after graduation , Hughes found himself fighting in Korea . He 'd had no officer training school , but he was put in charge of a platoon . <p> ' My infantry school was John Flynn , ' Hughes said . <p> ' I gave him the worst platoon , a dispirited platoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform , ' said Flynn , a 1944 West Point grad . Within weeks , Flynn said , Hughes had the platoon whipped into shape . <p> ' I did n't know what the hell I was doing , ' Hughes said . ' It was like pushing wet spaghetti to get my troopers to do certain things . I did n't know my craft really that well . So I 'd take the hill myself . ' <p> A year later , Hughes became company commander . He fought titanic battles with the 7th Cavalry from November 1950 to December 1951 , becoming the Class of 1950 's most decorated warrior : Distinguished Service Cross , Silver Star with oak leaf cluster , Bronze Star , Purple Heart , and Combat Infantry Badge . Later , Lt. Col. Hughes commanded the 25th Division in Vietnam , earning a third Silver Star and 14 air medals . <p> After Korea , Hughes served at Fort Benning and West Point , teaching cadets English and that Moby Dick was more than a fish story . <p> ' My first real remembrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1959 graduate , ' comes from sitting across the desk from him and watching him review my academy file - I had been turned out in Plebe English . He looked up after a couple of minutes and asked , ' Do you want to pass ? " ' I 'm not sure how my affirmative response was phrased . However , I remember him saying , ' OK , soldier , this is what we are going to do . ' ( There was an emphasis on the ' we . ' ) ' <p> Hughes assigned five writing projects every day for seven days . The lessons paid dividends for years to come . <p> ' The lasting impact of Dave Hughes on my life , ' continued Prisk in Hughes ' nomination for the West Point honor , ' and me as a person would be difficult to measure . ' Prisk has written four books , published several articles and authored numerous officer efficiency reports . <p> Hughes served from 1964 to 1966 as adviser to the Army chief of staff and later to Secretary of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 1966 State of the Union address , and McNamara 's landmark speech that marked the break with the administration , predicting the changing role of America 's military , a vision playing out on the front pages of newspapers today . <p> ' I think differently than a lot of people , ' Hughes said . <p> Never was that more evident than at Fort Carson , where he served as a colonel under Gen. Bernie Rogers , a man Hughes called ' a great one . ' <p> ' I consider I had three wars : Korea , Vietnam and Fort Carson , ' Hughes said . ' We had every problem in a soldier suit that the country had . ' <p> Knowing a social revolution was underway , Hughes and other leaders strategized how they could keep the lid on the place and keep communications between soldiers and commanders wide open . <p> ' We did very wild things , ' Hughes said . ' We had go-go girls in the clubs , we had beer in the barracks , we had racial harmony councils . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was going to be volunteer . We had to deal with the social reality . We let the blacks have black guerilla theater in the main post theater so they could get off their chest their black rage in a socially approved forum called theater . Then we could expect them to salute when they walked out the door . ' <p> When Jane Fonda came to the post and said : ' You 're running a political prison called your stockade , ' the post did n't greet her with a bayonet , but an invitation to meet with the general and tour the stockade . <p> ' Nobody had ever been that candid with her . We had nothing to hide , ' Hughes said . ' We invited her to bring her anti-war troupe to the main post theater . <p> ' We were scholars and students of the change . The country was going through change , and so were we in the Army . ' <p> After 27 years , including his service at West Point , Hughes retired as an Army colonel in 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized the future is more important than the past , ' he said . <p> Hughes organized Colorado 's centennial celebration in 1976 , then launched an effort to revitalize Old Colorado City , now a historic district on the city 's west side . <p> Hughes kept track of the renewal project on a microcomputer - one of the first sold in the United States . <p> He provided the first dial-up service in Colorado Springs and established a bulletin board known as ' Roger 's Bar , ' after the legendary bar that once graced Colorado Avenue in Colorado Springs . <p> ' I was the electronic bartender , ' Hughes said . <p> Hughes knew early that the computer would become much of mankind 's means of production . He also knew something that others who had stood in his shoes did not : ' The rural areas are going to get screwed . ' <p> So Hughes concentrated his genius on small towns . Between 1989 and 1993 , Hughes established the nation 's first successful rural education network .

' But they 'd have to put it on a glacier that moves 4 feet a day . You do n't keep it lined up . ' <p> They asked Hughes for help . He called an engineer at Cisco Systems and asked the company to donate three $ 1,000 radios . <p> ' So they can put the satellite up on hard ground - 19,000 feet and use a 4-kilometer link down to the cybercafe and then the climbers and their parties could send e-mail for $ 1 a minute - ' Hi , Mom , I 'm at the base of Mount Everest , send money .
