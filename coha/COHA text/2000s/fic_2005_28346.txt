1 . THE REPLACEMENT The British Lines , Near Ypres , Western BelgiumAutumn 1915 The darkness was complete , a slow march into a black , wet hell . He was the last man in the short column , one part of a line of twenty men , guided by the low sounds in front of him , soft thumps , boots on the sagging duckboards . There were voices , hard whispers , and , close to him , a hissing growl from the sergeant : " Keep together , you bloody laggards ! No stopping ! " No one answered , no protests . Each man held himself tightly inside , the words of the sergeant swept aside by the voices in their own minds , a tight screaming fear , the only response they could have to this march into the black unknown . They had come as so many had come , crossing the Channel on small steamers , filing through the chaos of the seaports , and after a few days , they had boarded the trains . There was singing , bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruits . They had stared curiously at the French and Belgian countryside , returning the smiles of the people who greeted them at every stop , and few noticed that as the trains moved farther inland , closer to the vast desolation of the Western Front , the villagers were quieter , the faces more grim . Then the trains stopped , and the men were ordered out onto roads that had seen too much use , repaired and repaired again . They would march now only at night , hidden from the eyes in the air , the aeroplanes that sought out targets for German artillery . If the roads were bad , the small trails and pathways were worse , men stumbling in tight files , moving closer still to the front . The fire in the recruits was dampened now , by the weather , theever-present mud , the soggy lowlands of Flanders . Then came the first sounds , low rumbles , louder as they marched forward . Even in the darkness , both sides threw a nightly artillery barrage at the other , some firing blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief glimpse of movement on the road , convoys of trucks and horse-drawn carts . Some had the range , knew every foot of the road that stretched out behind the enemy 's lines . Throughout the night , the targets might be unseen , but they were there , and every man at every big gun knew that in the darkness , each road , each small path might be hiding great long lines of men , new recruits , the replacements who marched quietly to the front . His guts were a twisted knot , his arms pulled to his sides , one hand tightly curled around his rifle , his eyes straining at the unseen man in front of him . The soft wood beneath him was bouncing now , sagging low , and his knees buckled , trying to match the rhythm of the footing . There were more soft sounds , splashes , the duckboards spread across some chasm of black water . His mind tried to focus , one foot in front of the other , keeping his boots on the narrow wooden boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the duckboards some kind of bridge , but the image was not complete , his mind shouting at him , to the front , focus to the front . The man in front of him made a low grunt , water splashing , the man stepping hard , trying to catch himself . " Bloody hell ! " He stumbled as well , his boots down in the water , the duckboards sagging too low , and he felt the man suddenly beneath him . He fought for his balance , falling now , one hand pushing down hard on the man 's back . " Get off me , you bloody bastard ! " " Shut up , Greenie ! On your feet ! " It was the sergeant again , and rough hands grabbed his arm , jerking him upright . Beneath him , the other man pulled himself to his feet , both of them gripped hard by the sergeant . " Stay awake ! Keep moving ! " He wanted to whisper something to the man in front , an apology , but the march was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , soft sounds of water and wood . He felt the wetness in his socks now , the chill of the water adding to the cold hard stone in his chest . The replacements had been called Greenies from their first moment on the march , green troops , sent forward to rebuild the front-line units , fill the gaping holes in the British regiments . Their training had been rapid , some said far too rapid , a nation scrambling to find new soldiers , more soldiers than anyone had thought they would need . They had been parceled out into small squads by a system none of them understood , led by unfamiliar sergeants , hard , angry men who had done this work before , the men who knew the trails , who could find their way in the dark . He had joined with many of his friends from the village , a small farming town near the Scottish border . No one had thought the army would be away from home through Christmas , but the newspapers spoke of great battles , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign and fantastic . In the village , there had been talk of young men who would not come home , strangers mostly , sons of farmers barely known , word of families in mourning . His friends spoke of the adventure of it all , that if any of them missed it , or worse , avoided it , they would be called shirkers , traitors to the king . No matter the accounts in the newspapers , a massive and bloody war that had swallowed the whole of Europe , few who lived in the small village could resist the call , to march in song and parade to join a war the likes of which Britain had not seen since Napoleon . He tried to adjust his massive backpack , the darkness broken by a small clink of metal , his canteen rattling against the trenching tool that hung down the side of his pack . He had become used to the weight , the clumsy mass just part of the rhythm of the march , bouncing with him on the duckboards . The ground beneath him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the boots were louder , echoes in the darkness . He heard voices to one side , a group of men , still unseen , and the voices hushed as they passed . He stared through the darkness , wondering , officers perhaps , speaking of plans and tactics . He glanced up , no stars , the night still thick and black . A soft breeze swept past him , a wave of sharp odor . He hunched his shoulders , fought off the smell , but it was all through him , burning his nose , then harder still , sharp and sickening . The man in front of him made a choking sound , others as well , hard coughs , curses . " Keep moving ! That 's just the roses , you bloody greenies ! Plenty more to come ! " The smell was settling dull in his mind , his brain numbing to it . The breeze seemed to stop , but the smells were still there , all around him , and the man in front of him said , " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape , could hear the hard buzz of flies , was grateful now for the dark . He squinted his eyes , fought through the worst of the smell , stared down for a long while . The march continued , more hard odor , different , unseen decay , and he focused on his footsteps , tried not to think of what lay rotting in the deep mud around him . He could see the faint outline of his boots , the motion steady , constant , realized he could see . He looked ahead of him , could see a shape , the man in front of him outlined in a dark gray mist . He glanced to the side , more shapes , low hulks , movement . The duckboards began to sag again , more splashes , and he looked down , each step pushing the water out in low ripples . He stared ahead , past the shadow of the man , tried to see beyond , to see where they were going , what the land looked like . The sergeant moved past him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line is just ahead . We 'll be at the guard post in a minute . Step down easy . We 're close . No talking . None ! Old Fritz is just out there a ways ! " He could hear something new , a slight quiver in the sergeant 's voice . There was none of the profane anger , the mindless screaming at men who had done nothing wrong . He thought of the word , close . How close ? Close enough that the sergeant is afraid ? He felt his legs turning cold , the hard chill in his chest spreading . There was another low voice , unfamiliar , the words barely reaching him . He could see another man , a gray shape , an officer , speaking in low tones to the sergeant , the man 's words finding him through the heavy mist . " Sergeant Cower . . . you 're late . . . daylight . . . heads low . " Behind the two men there was another low , fat hulk . But the soft dawn was spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round barrel . His heart jumped , hard tightnessof course , a cannon . A big one . The carriage was hidden , buried in the wet muddy ground , the barrel pointing out in the direction of the march . The sergeant was moving toward them again , waving his arm , a downward motion , words coming now , but there was a new sound , a hard whistle , ripping the air above them . The ground in front of him erupted , a mass of earth and men , and he felt himself pushed back , rolling down , his face hitting the mud , his backpack lurching up over his shoulders . There was another great scream , another shell landing a few yards to his left , the ground under him rising up in one great gasp , then settling back down . More dirt fell on him , heavy , a sharp punch into his backpack , nearly rolling him over . He gripped the ground , his hands clawing into the mud , but the sounds kept rolling over him , thunderous bursts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathe , blew a sharp breath out , his face buried in water , tried to raise his head , another great blast , lifting him up , dropping him again hard in the mud . He gasped for air , turned his face to the side , saw only smoke , no men , no great gun . He forced a breath , his throat seared by the heat . He looked for the sergeant , tried to shout , something , not words , fought for air , another scream above him , another great blast behind him , other sounds now , more screams . Men . The dirt settled on him again , and he thought of the sergeant , the man 's words , trench line , close . He raised his head up , saw motion , a man running , then another blast , the man disappearing , swept away . He tried to stand , the backpack nearly falling over his head , the weight pulling him over . He tried to run , his legs useless , soft jelly , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's go ! Move ! " The hand released him , and he reached down for his rifle , saw only water , the voice again . " Move ! " The man was running out ahead , and he followed , pumped his legs through the churned-up mud , the backpack bouncing wildly . He saw the man drop down , a large round hole , more black water , and he followed , stumbled down , splashed hard , water up to his waist . " Down ! " He rolled to one side , the backpack sinking beneath him , could sit now , water to his chest , the muddy rim of the hole above him , protection . The shells still came over them , but fell farther back now , the impact jarring him in hard rumbles . He wiped at his eyes , but the mud on his hands made it worse , and he blew hard through his nose , dislodging mud and water . His hands were empty , a new burst of fear , so many days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into every man , the punishment . Never lose your rifle . . . . " My rifle . . . I dropped it ! I have to go back . . . . " The hand clamped hard on his shoulder again , and he saw the face of the sergeant . " Stay put ! There 's more rifles to be found . You wounded ? " The question confused him , and he looked down , saw only water , said , " I do n't know . I do n't know . " " You better check , Greenie . But keep down . " He moved his hands along his sides , was suddenly terrified of what he would find . He felt for his legs , his hands probing slowly beneath the dark water , said , " I do n't know . It does n't hurt . " The sergeant did not laugh , said , " Roll over . Let me have a look . You could bloody well have a hole somewhere . There 's no pain , sometimes . Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the backpack rising up beneath him . Now there was a short laugh , and the sergeant said , " No , do n't appear you been hit . But the quartermaster 's gon na be mighty ticked . You let Fritz blow the hell out of your pack . " He slid the pack off , moved it around , saw shreds of cloth , the contents , his clothes , food rations , ripped to small bits of cloth and metal . He stared at the useless mass , pushed it away from him , watched it disappear into the water . " Say a prayer , Greenie . Probably saved your neck . " He probed again , his hands feeling his chest , stomach , and the sergeant was serious now . " Naw , Greenie , you 're fine . If I had n't gotten you into this shell hole , you might have joined your mates . Direct hit . . . " The sergeant paused , looked up into the thick gray sky . " Shelling 's stopped . For now . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's still anything left . Chances are , those boys fared better than you greenies . Take a look . See if anyone 's moving . " He slid to one side of the shell hole , adjusted his helmet , eased his head up slowly , and the sergeant said , " Go on , there 's nothing to fear now . Fritz ca n't see you back this far . If they start shelling again , you know where to find me . " He glanced up out of the hole , saw low drifting smoke , mounds of dirt , duckboards scattered , splintered . " I do n't see anything . " He turned , saw the sergeant staring at him , saw the man shivering , the water around him moving in low ripples . " You best go on . They 're waiting for the greenies up ahead . You 'll see the trenches , a hole bigger'n this one , pile of sandbags . Tell the guards you 're a replacement for B Company . They 'll know where to put you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something out into the black water . " Double-time it , though . Fritz could start his guns again . " " I do n't know the way . I 'll wait for the others . You have to lead the way ! " He felt a small cold panic rising , stared at the sergeant , who said , " Go ! I 'll be staying here . " " But the others ! " He was angry now , furious at this man , this bully , the big man with the temper and the hard hands , quick to punish , quick in his abuse of the replacements . From the beginning of the march , the sergeant had been on them , cursing them , finding fault with every step . He moved through the water , closer to the sergeant , said , " Damn you ! You can not just order me . . . . I can not just go alone ! We must find the others ! " The sergeant closed his eyes for a moment , said softly , " Direct hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . " " You 're mad ! Twenty men ! " He scrambled to the edge of the shell hole , eased his head up , searched the dull gray . His heart was pounding again , the cold returning . He climbed up farther , pulled himself out of the hole , crawled slowly away . The smoke was mostly gone , the air now thick with wet mist , a light rain beginning to fall . He paused , listened , tried to hear voices , heard only the faint hiss of the rain . He glanced beyond the shell hole , toward the front lines , the place where the trenches were supposed to be . He raised his head up farther , felt suddenly naked , no rifle , nothing in his hands , no heavy mass on his back . He felt light , like an animal , stood up slowly , bent low , began to move back , followed the shattered trail of the duckboards . He could see the muddy ground broken into round patches of water , shell holes in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , mine . . . but the butt was missing , useless . He eased close to a shell hole , said in a low voice , " Anyone . . . ? " He peered over the edge , saw an arm in the water , fingers curled in a loose grip around a rifle . He fought the sickness rising inside him , reached down , pulled at the rifle , the hand giving way , the arm now rising slowly , the man 's body pulled free of the mud below . He tried not to look , but the face turned up in the water , familiar , the name digging into him , Oliver . He turned away , pulled the rifle close to him , held it for a long moment , fought the tears , the panic . He tried to breathe , his throat tight , said in a low voice , " Sorry , old chap . I 've lost my Enfield . Do n't expect you 'll tell the captain . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
