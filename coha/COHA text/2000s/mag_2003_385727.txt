THE ADMINISTRATION A conversation with the secretary of defense  --  and the missus <p> Dateline : Out West <p> Donald Rumsfeld 's up and at ' em , raring to go  --  as usual . Big grin , bounce in his step , shiny as a penny . We 're at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs , where the secretary has just hosted a conference of NATO defense ministers . The Broadmoor has a significant place in Republican history , and in American history : It 's the resort where George W. Bush had his famous 40th-birthday bash , at which point he said , " No mas  --  no more drinking , " and began the ascent that culminated in the presidency . <p> But anyway , Rumsfeld is leaving the Broadmoor and flying to the Los Angeles area , where he 's giving a speech at the Reagan Library . Our departure from the hotel is rather quiet , not to say ho-hum . Other defense ministers have roared out with sirens blaring , lights flashing  --  a lot of pomp . But the Rumsfeld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no traffic laws  --  just proceeds to the base where the secretary will meet his plane for the two-hour flight to California . <p> At the Reagan Library , October 10 , 2003 <p> Aboard the plane , Rumsfeld continues chipper . This is supposed to be a " bad week " for him because there 's been a controversy in the press concerning authority over Iraq : Rumsfeld is alleged to have lost some to Condoleezza Rice . He waves off the controversy , however , saying that everything 's proceeding normally , with a proper division of labor among the National Security Council staff , the State Department , and the Pentagon . <p> We talk about a range of things , beginning with NATO  --  as that has been the main business of the week . Do we still need NATO , more than ten years after the collapse of the Soviet Union ? Yes , says Rumsfeld , and it has been freshened by new entries from the East . In fact , when Rumsfeld made that notorious remark , last January , about " Old Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of NATO : old , established NATO , and the new , augmented NATO . " The center of gravity had shifted to the east , " he says , " and I was being hit with all sorts of questions about , ' Europe 's against you , ' and I was thinking to myself that the overwhelming majority of the European countries were supporting us  --  it just happened that the ones that were n't were Germany and France . " Rumsfeld likes to point out that the formerly Communist countries have been eager to aid the U.S. in Iraq , having a keen appreciation of freedom , and opportunities for a new beginning . <p> Discussion soon turns to the size of the military . A great many people argue that we need a bigger military : more people , more materiel , more of pretty much everything . How can we attend to our global responsibilities  --  or the ones we 've assumed for ourselves  --  with ( to be blunt ) a Clinton-sized military ? Mark Helprin made a powerful case for the " more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " April 22 , 2002 ) . <p> Rumsfeld says , first off , " Mark 's a smart fellow "  --  the understatement of the day . But he goes on to defend the current size of the military , stressing " flexibility " and " deconfliction " ( i.e. , the need to keep different parts of the military out of one another 's way ) . He cautions against a " mindset that 's still back in the 20th century , " and claims that " the people who really get it are the ones who just went through " the Afghan and Iraq campaigns . " It 's a clich to say , ' Well , technology may be more sophisticated these days , but that does n't change the need for boots on the ground , ' and we know that . " It should be recalled , however , that " the Soviets had 300,000 troops on the ground in Afghanistan , and they lost . " <p> Moreover , he says , we must make sure , in Iraq , that we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Foreign forces  --  including those from the United States  --  " ought to be there to help stabilize the situation " and then get out . It 's encouraging , he says , that " we now have 56,000 Iraqis who are contributing to their own security , and I do n't mean just standing around and observing . " No , " they 're contributing in non-trivial ways  --  fighting and dying . " He adds that he 'd be " the first one in the world " to recommend more of our own troops in Iraq , if he were told by those in charge over there that we needed them . <p> Likewise , would he ask for a bigger military , overall , if he thought it were necessary , no matter what the political or budgetary considerations ? Hell , yes ( in a word  --  or two ) . Rumsfeld says that , when he first went to Washington in 1957 , the U.S. was spending a much bigger percentage of GDP on defense , and we could easily do so again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotes from the New York Times , having to do with the **25;1725;TOOLONG story : An " administration official " ( anonymous ) has said , " This is about more than just how we handled Iraq . It 's about getting the Rumsfeld crowd to understand the reality of what 's happening , and what 's not working . " And a " senior American diplomat " has said , " Rumsfeld does n't like this because he does n't want to admit anything went wrong . So , what else is new ? It 's Rumsfeld . " <p> Does he have anything to say about that ? The SecDef practically leaps out of his chair : " He 's talking about me ! And this is n't about me ! It 's so far beyond individual personalities . It 's about Iraq , and the future of that country , and the future of our own country ! " Anything else , he contends , is insignificant , including intra-administration intrigue  --  the existence of which he downplays anyway . <p> Speaking of intra-administration politics : I bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good world press , " I note . " Excellent , " Rumsfeld interjects , gulping down coffee : an excellent press  --  " and in the U.S. , too . " " Yes , I meant to include that , " I continue . " And you , on the other hand , have a rather less good press . Do you have a bit of a good cop/bad cop routine going on , and do you find Secretary Powell 's excellent press just the slightest bit irksome ? " No , he says , there is no good cop/bad cop , at least not consciously , and certainly not on his part . As for the press , " The only thing I worry about is what 's best for the country , and what 's best for the administration , " and that entails doing your job , in fair press weather or foul . <p> I further point out that a lot of people believe that Rumsfeld enjoys war , that he 's belligerent  --  that the War on Terror has been a high for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-part answer . First , anyone who believes this of him does n't know him . He and his wife  --  who is traveling with him , incidentally  --  have visited many military hospitals , seen men with limbs blown off , without faces . And second , he is , it 's true , very competitive  --  and if there 's a fight , he seeks to win it . <p> We come back to the press . It has plenty to say about Rumsfeld ; what does he have to say about it ? In the main , he thinks that the press is a little lazy and a little gullible  --  unwilling to check things out , too ready to accept assertions at face value . " Washington has changed so much since I first arrived . Today it seems so organized around talking points . " On a Sunday-morning talk show , you might hear a fellow saying the same thing " five , ten times in 28 minutes . " And " you get the feeling , ' Fair enough : Either he believes what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " And the talking point may be true : but does n't the " journalistic community " have a responsibility to go find out ? <p> He cites a few specifics : 1 ) " Go it alone "  --  the idea that , in Iraq , the United States was " going it alone . " 2 ) " We need more troops " ( in Iraq ) . 3 ) " No plan "  --  the U.S. was unprepared for after-Saddam . And 4 ) our old friend " imminence "  --  the Iraqi threat was n't imminent , and the administration said it was . Rumsfeld knocks down all of these , in emphatic detail . About No. 4 , he asks , " When , by the way , was 9/11 ' imminent ' ? An hour before it happened ? A week before ? A month before ? A year before ? " <p> I ask whether Rumsfeld reads Maureen Dowd , the New York Times columnist who regularly makes sport of him . He allows that he reads the headline and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he quits . " Do you know her ? " he asks me . " No , " I say , " but you 've been good for her career . " He responds : " I 'm not so sure about that  --  that this has been good for her career . " A highly interesting point , which there is too little time to pursue . PARTNER FOR LIFE <p> Any subject may be pursued with Joyce Rumsfeld , the secretary 's wife of nearly 50 years . This is a famous marriage in political circles , and Mrs. Rumsfeld is an impressive and admired figure in her own right : a reader and a thinker , a doer and an advocate , warm and open . She and the secretary both come from Chicago , as can be heard in their accents ( hers even more than his ) . When did they meet ? " In high school , when we were 14 . " Was he the most popular guy in school ? " Yes . " Was she the most popular girl ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He was fun , exciting . There was a little mystery there . I sort of followed him around . " They were married right after college . <p> Mrs. Rumsfeld is happy to be back in Washington , after a 25-year hiatus . ( Following his stint as defense secretary in the Ford administration , Rumsfeld went into business , although he performed several tasks for the government during those years . ) Mrs. Rumsfeld is obviously a patriot and an idealist . Besides , she says , " This is a good age , the age at which Don and I find ourselves "  --  perspective has been gained , and criticism is unstinging . What 's more , she likes this president , George W. Bush : " He 's my kind of person . He 's straightforward , he knows his own mind , he believes things . He does n't flop around . " <p> And what 's it like , if I may , to be married to a man widely considered a ... sex symbol . " Odd , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People just love him , just mob him , wherever we go . " ( A military aide nearby , and overhearing this conversation , chimes in , " Yeah , sometimes I feel like I 'm a roadie with Pearl Jam "  --  a rock group . ) Mrs. Rumsfeld talks of being in New York recently , and dropping by Bergdorf 's , the department store , with her husband . " A clerk was helping some customers , and she just dropped them when Don came in . She was so flustered . She could n't speak . Later she actually apologized . She said , ' I do n't know what came over me . Movie stars pass through here all the time , and it does n't faze me . But when your husband showed up , I thought I was going to pass out . ' " <p> I ask Mrs. Rumsfeld whether her husband has occasioned this sort of excitement throughout his career ( he was elected to Congress at 30 ) . No , she says : It 's a recent phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  that 's her best guess . The public can see Rumsfeld for themselves , taking in whole press conferences , if they like , forming their own opinions , not having to rely on snippets or others ' reports . This has made an astounding difference . <p> At this point , the secretary bounds back and says to his wife , " We 're comin ' up on the Grand Canyon "  --  and remembers the time when he and Mrs. Rumsfeld had to walk out , because he had a bad back and was unable to sit on his horse . Nine hours , it took them . " In what decade was this ? " I inquire . " Oh , about eight or nine years ago , " he answers . That , and whitewater rafting , and other such activities are the Rumsfelds ' idea of fun . <p> Mrs. Rumsfeld is a bit of a media maven , and I ask whether she reads the New York Times . Yes , she says , " but faster than I used to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're " thoughtful , worthwhile , and not knee-jerk . " And does she read Maureen Dowd ? " Yes , I do . " And ... ? " Well , she 's clearly a bright and talented person , " but her mission seems to be ridicule  --  artful ridicule , with little content or argument . The whole thing is soaked in cynicism . And " there is nothing I like less in a person than cynicism . I hope that the columnist is not cynical in the rest of her life . Because , to be cynical 100 percent of the time  --  that would be sad . " NO CHOICE BUT TO WIN <p> Donald Rumsfeld , like his wife , is plenty idealistic , but he 's also very hard-headed ( and so is she , for that matter ) . I ask him a question of the hour : Can the Middle East undergo a democratic transformation , or should the U.S. confine itself to eliminating terrorists and their state supporters , whenever possible ? " Well , " he says , " the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security , our own defense ( for there is no true and tight defense at our border ) . If we can get " another one or two or three countries to allow their people to be free , " that would be " terrific "  --  it would also contribute handsomely to American security . But the central purpose of the war is self-defense . <p> And what about " preemption " ? Has this overtaken deterrence and containment as the leading U.S. doctrine ? Rumsfeld says , essentially , that all of the above are necessary  --  and that , " in history , " we have always had all of the above . " I mean , if a duke saw a neighboring army forming on the border , he probably would n't wait around . There are certain things that are readily deterrable , and there are certain things that are not readily deterrable . The Afghan government was not deterred from harboring Osama bin Laden and his people "  --  even after 9/11 , when the Taliban was given an ultimatum . And " Saddam Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war with Iraq . We went through all this pain at the U.N. , went through all these efforts , gave them last chances "  --  but nothing . <p> A final question concerning the War on Terror : Will Americans stick with it , or will they get worn down ? " They stuck with the Cold War , " Rumsfeld quickly notes . " And I think Americans have a good sense of what 's important . I have a lot of confidence in people . " <p> As we land at the airport near the Reagan Library , the secretary spots an old plane on the ground and calls back to his wife , " Joyce , do you see that ? " " Yes , Rummy , " she answers . The secretary was a naval aviator in the ' 50s , and Mrs. Rumsfeld has already told me , " We lived at the end of every airstrip . " <p> At the library , the event begins with the Pledge of Allegiance . This is not a public school , so there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the board here , says , " Americans are very fortunate that he is secretary of defense , and America 's enemies are very unfortunate . " Rumsfeld proceeds to wow ' em ( which is easy , granted ) . And , hours later , at the end of a long day , he pulls away in an SUV  --  still chipper , still jaunty , still grinning , still bouncing , still shiny , evidently loving what he 's doing , and having no doubts about the justice of it . <p> By Jay Nordlinger <p>
