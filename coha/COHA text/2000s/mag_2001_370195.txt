GOOD NEWS <P> SPLITTING HEADACHES Here 's a new pick-me-up for longtime sufferers . Researchers report that a combination of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants and stress-management training can significantly reduce the severity and frequency of chronic tension headaches . The regimen is not for folks who suffer from migraines or the occasional pounder ; it 's for those with head pain that is severe and unremitting , occurring nearly every day for at least six months . And though the antidepressants require a prescription , they may be a better choice than aspirin , Advil or other over-the-counter pain relievers , most of which can trigger rebound attacks in chronic sufferers . <P> RACIAL DISPARITY African Americans suffer congestive heart failure twice as often as do whites  --  and are more likely to die of it . Yet for unknown reasons , they do n't seem to get much benefit from treatment . Now doctors show that a combination of a new beta blocker , called Coreg , and ACE inhibitors is equally effective for blacks as it is for whites , Asians and Hispanics at slowing the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOOK , MA , CAVITIES ! Thought you had heard every reason to quit smoking ? Here 's a new one : to protect your kids ' teeth . It turns out that secondhand smoke can nearly double the risk that kids ages 4 through 11 will develop cavities . What 's the connection ? A by-product of nicotine called cotinine , once thought to kill off the bacteria linked to cavities , actually does the opposite , encouraging tooth-destroying bugs to grow and multiply . <P> DIAGNOSIS : FEMALE Even after adjusting for all other risk factors , such as diabetes , high blood pressure and age , researchers have found that women are nearly 60% more likely than men to suffer a stroke after heart surgery  --  and 15% more likely to die soon afterward . Why ? Researchers have no explanation . <P>  --  By Janice M.
