The people who stand ready to trade their lives for ours are part of a tradition that goes back 400 years <p> IN THE DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center , a 77-year-old man from Teaneck , New Jersey , tried repeatedly to cross the George Washington Bridge . He was turned away . But he tried again , and again , until finally police and military personnel waved him through , and soon enough , he was among those thousands who were putting their lives at risk in what proved to be a vain attempt to find and rescue survivors in the smoldering ruins of the Twin Towers . <p> The man from Teaneck knew something about rescues , about building collapses , and about fires . Reginald Julius had joined the Fire Department of New York in 1949 after giving up a job as a letter carrier for the Post Office . His motivation was simple : The Post Office job paid $2,400 a year ; the Fire Department paid $3,000 . " No decision necessary , " he would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FDNY until the late 1980s , when he retired as chief of the Twelfth Battalion , which covers parts of northern Manhattan . As with so many other firefighters around the country - from the largest paid department to the smallest volunteer organization - Reginald Julius 's " retirement " from the fire service simply meant an end to collecting full-time pay . Although he moved to suburban New Jersey , he stayed in touch with colleagues ( like his brother , Vincent Julius , a retired FDNY captain ) , regularly visited firehouses , and kept up with the latest developments in fire science . <p> So when 343 members of the department he loved were killed on a single , awful day , Reginald Julius grabbed the rubber boots , turnout coat , and white chief 's helmet that he had never put into storage , and he went where he was needed . When he finally got into Manhattan , he drove to his old fire-house in Harlem , boarded a commandeered city bus , and made the journey to hell . As he reported for duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him and said , " Well , I guess they 're calling in all the old buffaloes . " Retired Chief Reginald Julius smiled at the semi-affectionate nickname for firefighters of a certain age . " Let me do my work , " he replied . He pulled four consecutive 12hour tours , picking through the horrible wreckage and sickening carnage . He found bodies and pieces of bodies , but never did he find the two people he was looking for , the chiefs who had succeeded him at the Twelfth Battalion . They were among the 343 . <p> Reginald Julius was hardly the only retired firefighter at Ground Zero in the dangerous days just after the attack . There were dozens there , some of them searching for the sons who had followed them into the fire service . Firefighters from around the country flew in to assist the FDNY , and they worked Ground Zero for weeks , long after hopes for rescue had given way to the bleak ritual of recovery . Still others boarded airplanes or trains , put on their white gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a final salute to their fallen colleagues during the funerals and memorial services that followed September 11 . In their stories , rituals , and sense of fraternity , they represented traditions linking the firefighters of Ground Zero to American firefighters of past centuries . <p> FIREFIGHTING IN AMERICA , ONE OF the nation 's most colorful , storied , and dangerous jobs , is a 400-year-old tale told in three volumes . During most of the seventeenth century , as European settlements grew , firefighting was a civic obligation for all able-bodied males ; in the eighteenth century America 's fledgling cities formed volunteer fire departments ; and a century later the volunteer departments began to give way in the cities to paid , professional ones . While the popular image of today 's American firefighter is of a highly trained urban professional , more than 70 percent of the country 's more than one million firefighters are throwbacks to another era ; they are volunteers , many of them working in rural and exurban departments . Most cities are protected by a combination of paid and volunteer companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most famous professional fire department , 10 volunteer fire companies still operate . <p> Whether professional or volunteer , American firefighters share a sense of common history and sacrifice . The tragedy of September 11 was unprecedented , but a firefighter from Los Angeles in 1940 , Chicago in 1840 , or Boston in 1740 would have recognized the selflessness and devotion shown on that day . September 11 , 2001 , was the worst day in the history of the fire service in America . And during that terrible day , and in the days that followed , centuries of tradition and years of transition commanded the public 's attention as never before . Tradition ? Firefighters in America have been putting their lives at risk since the seventeenth century . Transition ? As the number of serious fires have declined in recent years , America 's firefighters quietly have taken on new responsibilities as first responders to all kinds of emergencies , from bomb threats to heart attacks , and many firefighters are now trained in CPR and other first-aid techniques . In fact , of those 343 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two were not firefighters but emergency medical technicians . They are included in the FDNY 's total because New York 's fire department , like many across the country , has been merged with the city 's emergency medical services . <p> While Americans have long admired their firefighters , not until September 11 did many of us fully appreciate the job 's heroism and dangers . Popular culture and the media have made many of us experts in police work ( or so we think ) . Firefighters , however , were nearly invisible in paperback novels , films , and prime-time television . Then , suddenly , they became international symbols of sacrifice , courage , and dedication to duty . They achieved a status seldom granted to mere mortals : They have become models for action figures , available in toy departments and stores near you . <p> Less celebrated are controversies that also have their roots in the history and traditions of the fire service . The American firehouse has been an outpost of masculinity like few others in contemporary life . Long after women police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women firefighters remain a rarity . New York offers the most explicit example , with no more than 30 women among its more than 11,000 firefighters . It is no coincidence that one of the many books celebrating firefighters after September 11 used the word Brotherhood in the title . Similarly , fire departments remain overwhelmingly white even in cities that are majority-minority , or close to it . The Fire Department of New York is 90 percent white ; the departments of Boston , Philadelphia , and Chicago between 70 and 75 percent white . Those statistics obviously indicate that fire departments have been slow to accept African-Americans , Latinos , and Asians . They also are reminders of the American fire service 's guild like traditions , which may be out of favor in the twenty-first century but nevertheless offer the service a cohesion and sense of family crucial in times of peril and tragedy . Firefighters often have a combat soldier 's view of the larger world ( and of their superiors ) . They trust each other , and only each other . And they take dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , seems willing to grant the fire service a pass on its struggles with workplace diversity . And while the outpouring of affection for the nation 's fire departments after September 11 may have marked a change in cultural priorities - suddenly the fame and achievements of athletes and movie stars seemed shallow and trivial - it was not the first time America so publicly embraced its firefighters . More than a century and a half ago a fictional volunteer firefighter from New York named Old Mose took the nation 's stages by storm . He was the central character in a play called A Glance at New York , and both the character and the play were so popular around the country that a series of sequels - called , inevitably , Mosaics - followed . Old Mose was a giant who drank beer from 50-gallon kegs that dangled from his belt , and whose personal consumption of oysters and beef was so prodigious that the rest of New York had to do without when he was on a binge . Historians have described Old Mose , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as urban America 's answer to Paul Bunyan . He was a Bowery b'hoy , a brawling character born of the new America taking shape in the nation 's cities . The b'hoys had a " rolling gait " and " surly manner , " wrote one historian , adding that they usually wore a " shiny stovepipe hat tipped over the forehead , soap-locks plastered flat . against the temple . " And , like many of America 's volunteer firefighters - including an ambitious young man in New York named Bill Tweed - Old Mose wore a bright red shirt and loud suspenders . The character of Old Mose was based on the exploits of a real-life New York firefighter , an Irish-American printer named Moses Humphreys , who was famous not only for his bravery but for the quick work his fists made of competing fire companies . <p> BY THE TIME OLD MOSE BECAME a pop culture icon in 1848 , America 's volunteer firefighters had established themselves as local heroes , capturing the public 's imagination with their brawny masculinity and larger-than-life escapades . Prints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dashing , gallant , and kindly urban knights who were both courageous and chivalrous , who asked for and received no pay for their services to the community . They also were the bane of many a politician and law-enforcement officer , for they took pride in their skepticism and sometimes outright defiance of civilian authority , and they seemed to enjoy righting one another in streets as much as they did fighting fires . <p> The raucous firefighters portrayed in the Martin Scorsese film Gangs of New York were very much a part of the Jacksonian tradition , a time when , as one of Andrew Jackson 's critics sniffed , it seemed as if anybody could become President . Or a fire chief , for that matter . Firefighting had been a gentleman 's vocation in the early years of the Republic , and volunteer fire companies in cities like Philadelphia actually functioned like private clubs . By the 1840s , however , urban companies were drawing from skilled craftsmen and laborers who insisted on electing their own officers , including , in some cities , the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentry , sometimes with good reason . While the volunteers were brave , they were also undisciplined and often seemed more interested in exacting revenge on a rival company than in actually putting out fires . <p> Still , when disaster struck , the firefighters of the 1840s showed they had at least one thing in common with the more genteel volunteers of the past . The organizer of Philadelphia 's first volunteer fire company , Benjamin Franklin , observed that his colleagues in the firehouse " have a Reward in themselves , and they love one another . " <p> As America learned on September 11 , 2001 , that has n't changed . <p> THE FIRE SERVICE IN EARLY colonial America was a form of mandatory community service . When fire broke out , adult males roused themselves from bed or left their work to man bucket brigades , taking their place on one of two lines . One line passed buckets filled with water from a well or reservoir to the fire ; the other line passed the empty buckets back to the water source . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as it was a defense against a larger conflagration . Unfortunately , the citizen firefighters of seventeenth-century America had plenty of opportunity to learn their vocation . Capt . John Smith said of Jamestown that he would consider himself safer in " wild Indian country " than within the settlement because of the tendency of " fools " to " burn down their homes at night . " <p> Decades later , authorities in Boston and New Amsterdam shared Smith 's frustration . The frequency of fires and the dangers to the community at large inspired colonial officials to initiate a struggle that continues to this day : imposition of a rudimentary fire code , which placed the interests of the public in general and firefighters in particular against the rights of property owners and developers . Boston authorities and the famous Dutch reformer in New Amsterdam Peter Stuyvesant outlawed roofs made of grass and thatch , and they also banned the use of wooden chimneys - yes , wooden chimneys . <p> Fire was something of an obsession with Stuyvesant ( that and the tendency of New Amsterdam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayors of New York no doubt will sympathize ) . He raised a property tax in order to buy 150 new leather fire buckets . And he purged New Amsterdam of its curious wooden chimneys and thatched roofs . Few government officials respected the rights and privileges of property more than Peter Stuyvesant , for he was , after all , an agent of Holland 's business interests . Still , he recognized in the 1650s that public safety and fire prevention required at least limited government control over private property . And so was born the centuries-old debate between firefighters and real estate developers over just how much regulation in the name of safety is enough . More than 300 years later , in the late 1990s , some of New York 's firefighters battled developers over legislation that would have required all residential buildings to be retrofitted with sprinklers . It was a bitter battle , one the firefighters lost . The city council decided the measure would be too expensive . <p> Stuyvesant also took a tentative step toward a paid fire department in New Amsterdam , hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ladders , and sending them out on patrol at night . They were empowered to examine private homes to make sure that chimneys were properly swept . Later citizens of the colony established a " rattle watch , " in which a captain and eight men were given rattles to sound an alarm when they spotted a fire ( or a crime in progress ) . The patrols were so successful that Stuyvesant soon had a complement of 50 fire wardens . While they were not paid firefighters per se , these men certainly were the ancestors of today 's FDNY . <p> Firefighting as a profession began in Boston in 1678 , about a quarter-century after the city had ordered its first , primitive fire engine from an ironmaker named Joseph Jynks . The city hired a professional fire company of a dozen men and an officer to operate another engine the city had recently purchased from London . No other cities immediately followed Boston 's lead in hiring and training a corps of professional firefighters . In fact , New York waited until 1865 before establishing a paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated , colonial officials realized that they could no longer depend simply on the civic spirit of brave but untrained civilians . In 1731 New Yorkers assembled near City Hall to witness the arrival of the very latest in firefighting technology , two pumpers that could throw water on a fire through a primitive nozzle . The engines had been developed in the shop of a savvy English inventor named Richard Newsham , who had the foresight to publicize his machines in broadsides published in the New World . The advertisements noted that Newsham 's fire engines had so dazzled the Old World that no less a figure than King George II had ordered one to protect his palace . Thus was born , long before Madison Avenue was so much as a cow path , the celebrity endorsement . <p> The arrival of these sophisticated engines and the growth of settlements along the New World 's Eastern Seaboard soon required a trained corps of firefighters . Volunteer fire departments were organized in New York , Philadelphia , Boston ( to complement the paid fire company there ) , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firefighters an exemption from jury service - a tactic that might be employed to good use today - and from militia duty . <p> Of course , not just any citizen was welcome . From its very beginnings , fire service was considered man 's work , and in most cities , Charleston , South Carolina , being one exception , white man 's work at that . What 's more , those white men were expected to be , in the words of a law that created New York 's volunteer fire department , " sober " and " discreet . " <p> There certainly was enough work , and enough danger , to keep the volunteers on the straight and narrow . Even as America 's emerging cities added to their fire codes by regulating building materials and restricting the storage of explosive material , fire was a constant worry . " By one thoughtless act , " wrote a Philadelphia citizen , " a whole neighbourhood , town or city , may be shortly reduced to ashes , great numbers of lives lost , and numbers ruined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to the Revolution and for a time afterward , America 's volunteer fire companies included people of the caliber of Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , Samuel Adams , and George Washington . Franklin , who surely was not the most objective source on the subject , described volunteer firefighters as " brave Men , Men of Spirit and Humanity , good Citizens , or Neighbours , capable and worthy of civil Society and the Enjoyment of a happy Government . " They certainly were worthy of admiration , for they were expected to respond instantly to an alarm , and more often than not , that meant leaving their homes at night , when more fires occur , and returning hours later - wet , cold , and exhausted , with no reward other than the admiration of fellow citizens and the camaraderie of their fellow firefighters . <p> ONE OF FIREFIGHTING 'S HARDIest traditions , the firefighting family , can be traced to the early volunteer days . The Stoutenburghs of New York served on the Common Council , won appointment to early patronage jobs like oversight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's volunteer fire companies . One of them , Jacobus Stoutenburgh , was given the title of " chief engineer " of New York 's volunteer fire department in 1760 . He was among America 's first fire chiefs . <p> He also was part of another fire department tradition - the convergence of firefighting and military service . Firefighters to this day tend to be veterans in numbers disproportionate to the general population ( Chief Reginald Julius , for example , served in the Navy in World War II ) , and during the Civil War , firefighters formed their own regiments in the Union Army . Stoutenburgh was a patriot , and when George Washington evacuated New York in the fall of 1776 , leaving the city to the British , he and many other volunteers under his command joined the American army . Legend has it that Stoutenburgh formed a battalion of firefighters and was commissioned an officer , and Stoutenburgh 's name does appear on muster rolls from the war . <p> The volunteer fire departments and fire clubs of the 1760s and 1770s played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carp noted in an October 2001 article in The William and Mary Quarterly . Carp found that of the 36 men who turned out at the inaugural meeting of the Albany Sons of Liberty in 1776 , 20 were volunteer firefighters or firemasters , who inspected buildings for fire hazards . " These social bonds , " Carp wrote , " . provided the structure for the formation of organized resistance to the Stamp Act . " At least seven fire companies in Philadelphia , Carp noted , instituted their own nonimportation agreements during patriotic boycotts of British goods in the 1760s and 1770s . ( Among other measures , the firefighters swore off all but domestic beer . ) <p> The end of the Revolution brought a reorganization of the young Republic 's volunteer fire departments . The model created under British rule remained largely intact , but over the first five decades of American independence , the profile of the volunteer firefighter changed . Businessmen and other civic leaders gave way to blacksmiths and cobblers and other skilled laborers in the 1830s . Soon the indefatigable diarist George Templeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firemen do nothing but bustle around in their caps , swear at everybody and try to look tremendous . " Strong found that every aspect of firefighting in the post-Jacksonian age was " as badly conducted as possible . " He did not mention , however , that he chose not to follow the fine example of his aristocratic uncle Benjamin Strong , a financier who had served as a volunteer years before . <p> For better and worse , this was the golden age of urban America 's volunteer fire departments , roughly from 1835 to the Civil War . In their less savory moments , these firemen would look not unlike today 's English soccer hooligan . Every company wanted the honor of what they called " manning the pipe " - in modern terms , working the nozzle . Racing to a fire only to be relegated to a supporting role , like relaying water to the main pumper , was nothing short of humiliating . ( That point of pride remains intact . The nozzleman remains the envy of every self-respecting engine company , and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've arrived as a young firefighter . ) Brawls occasionally decided which company would work the pipes and which would provide unglamorous support . <p> Political clubhouses and gangs looked to firehouses as fertile recruiting ground in the 1840s for any number of reasons , not the least of them being that the neighborhood firehouse served as a social center . Not only the volunteers congregated there . So did young boys and teenagers who looked up to the firefighters as neighborhood celebrities . One New Yorker came to personify the intersection of politics , gangs , and firefighting : Bill Tweed , the onetime leader of the Cherry Street gang , the foreman of Engine Company 6 in downtown New York , and the boss of Tammany Hall . For Tweed , one job led naturally to the next . <p> Clubhouse and gang loyalties gave an added ferocity to rivalries between companies . A nineteenth-century history of New York 's volunteers is filled with admiring references to manly displays of fisticuffs between companies before , during , and after conflagrations . Philadelphia 's firefighters in the 1840s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the words of a contemporary observer , " pistols , knives , iron spanners and slung shot , whenever they met , whether at fires or in the streets . " A civic committee charged in 1853 that there was " scarcely a single case of riot brought before the court that has not its origin in the fire departments .. " <p> Even where riots were uncommon , disorderly behavior was not . In Nashville , authorities in the 1850s cracked down on firefighters who thought that battling a blaze required the assistance of liquids stronger than mere water . In Pittsburgh in 1842 firefighters took it upon themselves to identify and then protect thoroughly houses that served as brothels . A Pittsburgh firefighter , William G. Johnston , wrote that " a rowdy element managed to get a foothold " in the fire department , and those rowdies believed that " fighting was no small part of the duties of a fireman . " <p> So was electioneering . Volunteer firefighters became a potent political force in New York , Baltimore , St. Louis , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the emerging nativist movement , which noted that the volunteer firefighters were becoming Irish and Catholic through the 1850s . As the historian Amy Greenberg noted in her study of nineteenth-century volunteer fire departments , Cause for Alarm , the first elected mayors of Baltimore and St. Louis were firefighters ; so were several antebellum mayors of New York . In fact , when the New York Common Council fired a popular and decidedly independent fire chief , James Gulick , in the aftermath of the aptly named Great Fire of 1835 - it burned 52 acres in the financial district and destroyed 700 businesses - the firefighters countered by nominating and then electing Gulick to the minor post of city register . <p> Firefighters were a natural voting bloc in the 1840s for the very reasons that firefighting remains one of the nation 's last guilds . Despite the violence between companies in the 1840s , firefighters were and still are intensely loyal to one another . They share dangers that no outsider can know . They were and still are quick to perceive disrespect or claim a collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York in 1836 and twice in Memphis , in 1858 and 1860 , when they felt insufficiently appreciated . And , as firefighters proved in Baltimore , St. Louis , New York City , and elsewhere in the early days of the urban machine , they were happy to vote together when they felt slighted or their interests were at stake . The implications of this chip-on-the-shoulder insularity are being played out in firehouses throughout the country today , as women and minorities try to get a foothold in many professional departments . <p> Today 's firehouse culture , where firefighters literally live together and form bonds far stronger than in most civilian professions , has its roots in the intensely masculine , parochial , and raucous world of the Jacksonian volunteers . When cities began disbanding their volunteer departments before the Civil War and replacing them with professionals , the days of riot and rowdy behavior were over , but the culture was passed on - generally for the better , sometimes for the worse . <p> Professional firefighting in the cities of the late nineteenth century was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . They lived in their assigned firehouse 24 hours a day , save for three meal breaks , when they were allowed to return home for an hour or so . In some cities , chief officers lived with their families in their assigned firehouse . Days off were rare , perhaps one or two a month . <p> Still , the job was coveted , in part because professional firefighting retained the glamour and prestige it had when the work was performed by volunteers , in part because firefighting became , albeit slowly , a gateway job into the middle class . It was dangerous work , but with the coming of civil service reform in the 1880s , it also was secure work . Firefighters did n't lose their jobs in hard times . City hall never went out of business . <p> Understandably , then , immigrants and the children of immigrants in the roiling cities of late nineteenth-century America coveted firefighting jobs . While immigrants from Germany , Poland , Italy , and Scandinavia show up on the rosters of fire departments in the 1880s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service than the Irish . Like many other immigrants , the Irish craved economic security , having fled that most insecure of worlds - tenant farming - in the old country . By the time cities across the country began forming professional departments , the Irish already were a powerful voting bloc . They were more than happy to work for city hall , and often their friends in city hall were more than happy to accommodate them . <p> Inquiries into the distinct , insular , cohesive phenomenon known as firehouse culture have launched a thousand dissertations , examining American firefighters from the perspectives of gender , class , and ethnicity . Few , if any , have pointed out that at least in large cities like Boston , Chicago , New York , Baltimore , Philadelphia , and San Francisco , firefighting in the late nineteenth century not only was masculine , working class , and Irish , it was Catholic too . In the firehouse , Catholic immigrants and their children found a society and culture they recognized . Firefighters even in the volunteer days came to regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-segregated from politicians , civilians , and all other outsiders . Catholic immigrants , particularly those from Ireland , had set up their own institutions to separate themselves from Protestant nativists in the 1840s and 1850s . The fire departments of many large cities became almost an extension of the Catholic parish , school system , and social services networks . <p> FIREFIGHTING WAS TRANSFORMED into fire science in the late nineteenth century with the introduction of training academies , civil service exams , and tough physical standards for candidates . But not all firefighting was done in tenement houses and factories , of course , and not all firefighters were from the streets of urban America . On October 8 , 1871 , the very day that the nineteenth century 's most famous fire broke out in Chicago , the Wisconsin lumber town of Peshtigo went up in flames . By the time it was put out , the fire had killed at least 1,200 people and destroyed more than a million acres of forest and rural settlements . Forest fires were common in Wisconsin , as they continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike any other wildfire before or , in terms of lost lives , since . The Chicago fire , which killed at least 300 people , remains better known , but the Peshtigo fire was by far the greater catastrophe . And it continues to speak to another , less celebrated tradition of American firefighting , the professionals and volunteers who battle fires in rural and wild America . In Ghosts of the Foreground , a memoir of fighting recent wildfires in the West , Peter M. Leschak noted that the largest group of wildland firefighters are , in essence , freelancers who work sporadically for low wages and few , if any , benefits . Still , when fires break out , they put their lives on the line as surely as any professional firefighter in any American city or suburb . <p> Several twentieth-century fires stand out as tragic milestones : the blaze aboard the excursion boat General Slocum , which burned in New York 's East River in 1904 , killing more than 1,200 ; the fires set off after the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed nearly 500 ; the Hartford circus fire in 1944 , which claimed 163 lives , many of them children ; and the Happy Land social club fire in the Bronx in 1990 , which killed 87 . The worst fires often led to changes in firefighting tactics or building codes . After the blaze in Our Lady of the Angels school in Chicago in 1958 , which killed 92 children and teachers , the city demanded that all schools have automated sprinklers , among other safety measures , and as was and is so common after such tragedies , observers wondered why such an elementary step had not been in place before the fire . <p> But no fire in American history had the impact of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in New York in 1911 . The deaths of 146 garment workers , most of them young women , led to the passage of an array of laws regulating workplace safety and helped launch the careers of Alfred E. Smith , Robert F. Wagner , and Frances Perkins . It 's hard to imagine the New Deal without considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That blaze , which burned the eighth , ninth , and tenth floors of a building that still stands near Washington Square Park , also inspired the fire service in New York and around the country to press for stronger fire codes , mandatory fire drills , and more extensive use of technology like sprinklers . Even as the Triangle blaze was roaring , Edward Croker , one of the great fire chiefs in New York and American history , was denouncing the employers , like the owners of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company , who refused to conduct fire drills . Croker , the nephew of the notorious Tammany boss Richard Croker , soon retired from the FDNY to become a full-time advocate for fire prevention . <p> Just a few years after the Triangle blaze , America 's professional fire departments began to evolve into the highly trained corps of emergency workers we know today . Those in New York and Boston organized their first rescue units , a foreshadowing of the role firefighters were to play on September 11 , 2001 - that of first responder to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the professional departments throughout the country . Armed with special tools and training , they were prepared for just about any emergency , even those unrelated to fire . Nearly a century later , firefighters around the country - professional and volunteer alike - have taken on new responsibilities and , with them , new dangers in a world where fire and murder can be exported from caves in Third World countries . To cite just one small example , during a panel discussion among fire chiefs in suburban New Jersey not long ago , firefighters told of the HAZMAT training they now receive as a matter of course after September 11 . None of these departments had more than 100 members , which indicates just how widespread special training has become . In a sense , all firefighters belong to rescue companies now , although , given that firefighters have never lost the competitiveness that is the flip side to their intense solidarity , no rescue company member would ever concede such a premise . <p> Still , all firefighters know that if terrorists strike their city , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be on the front lines , risking their lives , as their predecessors did decades and even centuries ago . Volunteer or professional , urban or rural , whether battling blazes in apartment buildings or national parks , our firefighters share more than history and tradition and a sense of duty . They also share our admiration . With good reason . <p> September 11 was unprecedented , but a 1740s fireman would have recognized the selflessness shown that day . <p> Ben Franklin said his colleagues in the firehouse " have a reward in themselves , and they love one another . " <p> From the beginning , fire service was considered man 's work , and , in most cities , white man 's work at that . <p> To be given the nozzle for the first time is to know that you 've arrived as a young firefighter . <p> Firefighters around the country have taken on new responsibilities - and , with them , new dangers . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Confronting the unimaginable : New York firefighters on the morning of September 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens form a bucket brigade to feed their hand-pumped engine in a 1733 engraving . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A Baltimore fireman about 1850 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A New Haven , Connecticut , steam pumper in 1905 ; many of these powerful engines could throw more water than their present-day counterparts . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Call Building burns In San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake .
