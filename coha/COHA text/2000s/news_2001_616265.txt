<p> Three decades after the Civil War , you could n't shake a stick in the South without hitting a " colonel " who 'd fought in every battle from Bull Run to Appomattox . <p> Few of those poseurs were ever even officers . But with every year that passed after the South 's surrender , more soldiers promoted themselves . As late as the 1950s , one old man was hailed as the last Civil War soldier to die , but he turned out to be a fraud  --  not the veteran he 'd claimed to be . <p> Now , more than three decades after the 1960s ended , the same thing is happening again . People who claim to have served in Vietnam but did n't are sprouting like rice in muddy paddies . Wannabe civil-rights movement heroes are surfacing as well . <p> " There 's something about the ' 60s now that marks you as a significant person unless you snored through the decade and did nothing , " says David Oshinsky , a history professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era seen as one of the defining decades in recent history , filled with turbulence and self-sacrifice , it 's very hard all these years later to admit you were n't really part of it . " <p> History professor Joseph Ellis of Mount Holyoke College , who won a Pulitzer Prize this year for " Founding Brothers : The Revolutionary Generation , " is the latest example . He recently admitted he lied about serving in Vietnam , as well as his participation in the anti-war movement . <p> Other high-profile embellishers include actor Brian Dennehy , who claimed he was wounded in Vietnam but never served there ; Toronto Blue Jays manager Tim Johnson , who was fired after his tales of combat in Vietnam were shown to be false ; author and military historian Shelby Stanton , who claimed two tours in Vietnam but never served there ; and Adm . Jeremy " Mike " Boorda , who committed suicide when journalists learned he was wearing Vietnam combat decorations he did n't earn . <p> " Creative liberties are often taken with the facts of personal history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Alabama . " Embellishments are made in aid of the story and sometimes they get out of hand . " <p> The rise in false war claims coincides with the increase in esteem given the military after Desert Storm , and also with the polishing of Vietnam veterans ' public image . <p> Hollywood reflected the popular loser-to-hero view of the vets : One year after the war 's official end , Robert DeNiro played a crazed , pill-popping ex-Marine in " Taxi Driver ; " in 1978 " The Deer Hunter " depicted Vietnam vets as crazy and suicidal . By the late ' 80s and early ' 90s , however , soldiers were shown more sympathetically in " Platoon " and even " Forrest Gump . " <p> Also in the ' 80s , reporters began to notice that influential people  --  CEOs , members of Congress and others  --  had served in Vietnam , and that many negative stereotypes of vets were n't true . " At some point it was accepted that we are not all bad guys , " says Don Pardue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still carries a bullet in his left lung from Vietnam . <p> High schools and colleges updated curricula . Veterans began to be asked to speak in classrooms and at public events . And before long , it was n't just veterans who were talking , but phonies , too , " says George Marlow , 53 , a Lawrenceville car dealer who spent a year as a scout dog handler in Vietnam . " It 's easy to detect . I do n't know how many I killed , and if I told you , I 'd be lying . But you hear people bragging all the time . And that tells me they were n't there . " <p> " It seems people want to make up for not serving , " adds Max Torrence , a 54-year-old Atlanta bank executive and former Vietnam chopper pilot . And it 's not just resume-padders , but also the down-and-out who are making false claims , he says . " I am bothered by guys on the street who have signs saying ' homeless vet ' who wear camouflage jackets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas magazine " D " scouted the streets for homeless men who claimed to be veterans , finding nine of them . Only five had served in the military at all , and only one had set foot in Vietnam  --  and he 'd served only briefly before running afoul of military police and being sent home . <p> The Atlanta Vietnam Veterans Business Association , a 200-person group , has begun to screen prospective members , requiring each applicant to turn in their service records . One applicant has gotten the boot . ' Close to Martin ' <p> There are no definitive records to verify whether someone participated in the civil rights movement . But the real heroes can tell a wannabe from a bona fide . <p> U.S. Rep. John Lewis ( D-Ga. ) , of Atlanta , laughs aloud that " the number of people who say they took part in some of the marches could fill every football stadium in America . " <p> " All the time , people come up and say , ' I marched with you across the bridge at Selma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Hosea Williams was to my right . I knew the people behind me , " he says . <p> " You hear people say , ' I was in school with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , ' but if all these people were in his class , they could fill all the rooms on the Morehouse campus . " <p> Lewis , though , is forgiving . " I sort of take it and say , ' If it makes that person feel good , that 's OK , ' " he says . <p> Emory University historian David Garrow , who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book , " Bearing the Cross : Martin Luther King Jr . and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , " gets similar stories . " I do n't go four months without someone telling me how close they were to Martin , " he says . Categories of lies <p> Such specific claims are easily debunked , however . Groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Coalition and the Student Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee were tight-knit . " People knew people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given point in time knew other people in SNCC . <p> " I do n't begin to get it , why people like Ellis do this . It ca n't be rational because the odds on getting caught are so high . People must know this is self-destructive behavior . " <p> But people do lie , about their history and many other things . <p> Bella DePaulo , a University of California psychologist , has found that Americans lie in at least 20 percent of interactions that last 10 minutes or more . <p> " There are different categories of everyday lies , like what I call altruistic lies , " she says . " Like telling someone you enjoyed the dinner , the gift , something they meant to do to please you . It would be hard to negotiate your life without telling any of those kinds of lies . " <p> On the other hand , she adds , " there are truly exploitative lies , where someone deceives you for their own benefit . " These lies , she says , can be addictive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies , they are telling what they wish to be true , " she says . <p> " There is this odd , childlike quality " to lying , says Alan Hilfer , a psychologist at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn . " People think they can get away with outrageous tales . And people by nature want to believe good things and not be suspicious they 're being lied to . <p> " It 's just part and parcel of everybody 's existence , " Hilfer says . " People lie and they do n't even know it . It 's pervasive in everything . " <p> In recent decades , this inclination to lie has been reinforced by Americans ' mobility . It 's easier to lie to new acquaintances than old . <p> " If they 'd have gone home and told lies , they knew people would know , " says B.G. " Jug " Burkett , a vet and author of " Stolen Valor : How the Vietnam Generation was Robbed of its Heroes and its History . " " But in the suburbs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies and not get caught . " An emotional pull <p> So it 's easy to see how , for many baby boomers , memories of momentous , long-past events can prompt a tall tale , or worse . Burkett , who 's spent years investigating claims of Vietnam service , has personally identified more than 1,800 people from all walks of life who said they were there but were n't . <p> Says Oshinsky : " I teach modern American history . When you hit the decade of the ' 60s , ears perk up . It 's free love , the era of drugs , the invasion of British music , Jimi Hendrix . There is such an emotional pull from that era . Kids recognize it was a transforming decade , and they want to hear from people who played active roles . " <p> Michael Josephson , head of the California-based Josephson Institute of Ethics , says people have always lied about their histories . <p> " People lie about any event that will be credibility-enhancing , " he says . " They used to lie about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . <p> " What 's amazing is we continue to be outraged when we are lied to and we make liars pay heavy prices , while we are lying all the while ourselves . " <p> But the Ellis case could prompt a little more honesty , at least for a while , he says . <p> " High-visibility cases cause reform , " he concludes . " Maybe more people will start telling the unvarnished truth , even when it hurts . " Rep. John Lewis ( left ) , on a civil rights march with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . in Selma , Ala. , in 1965 , says he knows who was there that day  --  and who wasn't. / Staff Graphic : Illustration of a military officer giving a salute / MIKE DABROWA / Staff Photo : Caught up in Vietnam controversy : writer Joseph Ellis ( left ) , actor Brian Dennehy .
