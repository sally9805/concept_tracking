The unique and intimate alliance of the boyish and eccentric photographer Jacques Lowe , then 26 , and the Kennedy clan , the most power-hungry and wealthy family on the national stage , was at first unnoticed . But as it began in the mid-1950s , the Kennedy-Lowe relationship helped define , more than any record of the period , the Jack and Jackie Kennedy mythology . Lowe 's Remembering Jack , which appears on the eve of the 40th anniversary of J.F.K. 's death , is in many ways the most complete account of that youthful political insurgency and the magic it left behind . <P> Lowe was swept into the Kennedy glamour circle before most people knew there was such a thing . He was a half-Jewish kid born in Cologne , Germany , who hid from the Nazis with his mother in World War II and headed for America as soon as the war was over . When he arrived , he worked as an intern for some of the great LIFE photographers and developed a skill with the honest eye of the 35-mm camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcommittee investigating racketeering in the Teamsters , noticed Lowe 's vivid and intimate pictures of the famous hearings and invited the photographer into the tumultuous households of Hickory Hill and Hyannis Port . His pictures of the family of Bobby and Ethel given to Old Joe for his birthday wowed the patriarch , who called Lowe and said he wanted him to do the same for his other son , Jack . <P> Lowe 's first pictures of the Senator and his family , taken when Jack was stiff and rushed by the campaign schedule , disappointed the photographer . But they impressed Jack and Jackie , who summoned Lowe to the family 's New York City apartment one evening in the fall of 1958 . For hours the three of them crawled over the floor examining the contact sheets , choosing pictures to be used for the campaign and the family Christmas card . Lowe was stunned by his reception and left at 1:30 in the morning , after a convivial drink and the promise of more work ahead . <P> From then on , he was the only photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tough primary battles , the nomination at the Democratic National Convention , the triumphant national campaign and first months of the White House . Through his camera 's quiet and unblinking eye , the nation became aware of Jack Kennedy 's profile , his indestructible mat of hair , his smile and the winsome and soft beauty of Jackie .
