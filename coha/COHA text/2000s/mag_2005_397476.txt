Section : Resources Here 's how governments around the world extract money from the ground . They wait until someone has sunk a large sum of money into an oil well or mine , then change the tax rules . <p> POLITICAL FROTHING AT BIG OIL 'S THIRD-QUARTER profits  --  a combined $33 billion for the five largest firms in the U.S.  --  set a familiar Washington stage : chief executives in the dock at a Senate committee hearing in early November , the fulminating solons to their front , T-shirted protesters ( " Expose Exxon ! " ) to the rear . On Nov. 15 the Senate Finance Committee voted to slap a $5 billion surtax on oil companies . <p> That 's par for the course in oil drilling and mining . If you drill a dry hole , the money you lost was yours . If you make money , the government declares that it is a windfall and snatches it . <p> The classic theft occurred during the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 , when the new Soviet government nationalized the Russian assets of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers . Two decades later Mexican President Lzaro Crdenas did the same thing , grabbing the assets of the 17 foreign oil companies in Mexico . In time the U.S. government persuaded the Mexicans to pay $130 million in compensation for the confiscation , but oil companies thought the sum was inadequate . <p> Mineral extractors are easy expropriation targets , too . In 1968 President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) took over Belgian diamond-mining firm Sibeka 's operations there . ( A decade later he returned 20% of the company . ) That might have some connection to the fact that Mobutu , before he was finally run off in 1997 , reportedly pocketed $4 billion . In 1969 Zambia 's president , Kenneth Kaunda , more of a good old-fashioned socialist , nationalized Anglo American 's copper mines , some of the best in the world at the time . Following years of poor management and declining production , Anglo American repurchased the Zambian mines in 2000 for $90 million  --  only to pull out two years later , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be salvaged . <p> Governments have n't gotten less grabby , though most are now less blatant . As oil prices rose from $10 a barrel in 1999 to a recent $57 , 20 countries have changed their fiscal regimes to increase the government take from energy companies , according to a report by Graham Kellas at energy consultant Wood Mackenzie . The majority of countries made changes that apply to future licenses and production , thus giving the ExxonMobils of the world a chance to opt out . But Kellas identified eight instances in which the new higher taxes , royalties or export duties affect existing production . In other words , they changed the rules after the cards had been dealt . <p> " If you 're an oil company , you go where the oil is , " sighs Roger Tissot , a director at PFC Energy . " The location is decided by geology , and you have to deal with the political risk . " <p> Some of the biggest rule-changing has gone on in Venezuela , the world 's fifth-largest net exporter of oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chvez . In June the country 's state-owned oil company raised the royalties it collects on other companies ' wells . For some existing production the royalty went from 16% to 30% . The legislature joined in by jacking up income taxes on oil producers from 34% to 50%  --  and applied the tax retroactively . Only a few companies have made a stink about the changes . ExxonMobil is reported to be seeking arbitration ; its only comment now is that the company " wishes to explore an amicable resolution . " Total of France , one of the largest foreign investors in Venezuela , has paid the higher royalties under protest but has so far balked on paying back taxes , as have most of the other big oil companies . Big Oil is likely to acquiesce to Venezuela 's demands as long as oil prices remain high and their operations profitable . <p> Meanwhile , in mostly free-market Chile ( now governed by a left-center coalition ) , the approach is only different in tone . This past May Chile approved a tax on copper production that ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount produced . It 's likely to reduce earnings a mere 1% or 2% at Chilean mining group Antofagasta Plc . Even where the nick on a company is seemingly slight , the overall bounty to the state can be high . <p> Another banana republic when it comes to taxes on extractive industries is the United Kingdom . In 2002 it raised the tax on oil profits from 30% to 40% for companies operating in the North Sea . This change came after the industry had sunk $300 billion of capital in the ocean . New exploration ceased for a while . But as oil prices continued rising , such investment in exploration resumed . Some oil industry analysts expect Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to announce a further tax hike in the near future . <p> Perhaps the tin-pot legislators over in London were inspired by their counterparts in Washington . In 1979 President Jimmy Carter persuaded Congress to levy what was called a " windfall profits tax " on oil . It would be more accurate to describe the tax as an excise tax of up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil and a base price . Before it was repealed in 1988 , it raised a net $40 billion , significantly less than the government 's projected $175 billion . The net effect was an increased dependence on oil imports as domestic production fell between 3% and 6% and imports grew on the order of 10% annually , said a Congressional Research Service report issued in 1990 . <p> With oil prices high once again , the season is on for more tax hikes . In January Alaska Governor Frank H. Murkowski surprised oil executives by declaring that he would remove tax incentives from most outlying fields in Prudhoe Bay . The biggest losers : BP , Conoco Phillips and ExxonMobil , which together now face an additional annual tax bill of at least $90 million , estimates Fraser McKay of Wood Mackenzie . The trio have appealed the decision . <p> Investment in Bolivian natural gas exploration dropped 73% to a mere $13 million in the first half of this year compared with 2003 . The cause : uncertainty created while the government debated and ultimately passed a hydrocarbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32% income tax on gross revenues of natural gas and oil producers . This , on top of an existing 18% royalty . The new legislation has cast a chill on an otherwise promising natural gas industry . The country has the second-largest natural gas reserves in South America , after Venezuela . Foreign energy companies , keen on the potential , have invested $3 billion in the natural gas sector since it was privatized in the late 1990s . Now they are having second thoughts . <p> The Bolivian hydrocarbons law was passed against a backdrop of relentless protests by labor groups , miners , teachers and indigenous people against the government 's policy of opening the natural gas sector to foreign exploration . In September 2003 the ruckus included roadblocks that paralyzed much of the country and sparked a violent reaction from the Bolivian armed forces ; six villagers were killed . Protests escalated , and within a month President Gonzalo Snchez de Losada resigned and fled the country . The new president , Carlos Mesa , held a referendum , and Bolivians voted to reclaim state ownership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Though elected officials took steps in response this past May , many Bolivians believed the law did not go far enough . They demanded full nationalization . Tens of thousands of protesters blockaded La Paz , the capital , daily . In June Carlos Mesa was forced to resign . <p> The two biggest investors in Bolivia 's gas sector , Petrobras of Brazil and Repsol YPF of Spain , wo n't comment on the situation . But the big international producers in Bolivia sent a letter to the government asking for a " dialogue " about the new law . BG ( formerly British Gas ) says that a presidential election scheduled for December has put all talk on hold . But a BG spokesman says the company continues to operate and is not pulling out of the country . BG does contest three aspects of the hydrocarbons law : the forced signing of new contracts , limits on where producers can export and ownership restriction at the wellhead . " This is not about our investment . It 's very much about the future , " says BG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to generate development could be in jeopardy . " Try yelling that into a bullhorn in La Paz . <p> Sometimes a resource company faces pressure at home . Australian mining giant BHP Billiton first invested in the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea in the late 1970s and eventually acquired a 52% stake . Environmental groups in Australia began criticizing BHP Billiton for dumping tailings from the mine into the Fly River and harming much of the fishing and drinking water . In 1996 BHP Billiton settled out of court one lawsuit brought by affected villagers . But the legal battles brought by environmental groups and villagers continued at courts in Australia and Papua New Guinea . At one point in 2000 , protesters dumped dirt and dead fish in front of BHP Billiton headquarters in Melbourne . <p> BHP Billiton admitted that the pollution " exceeded initial predictions " and tried to convince the government of Papua New Guinea , which owns 30% of the mine , to shut it down . But the government refused ; the copper exported from the mine was among its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred its 52% stake to a sustainable development fund intended to benefit Papua New Guineans ; it wrote off its entire $416 million investment . <p> Since then copper prices have doubled , and the mine 's net income has tripled in the last two years to an annualized $45 million this year . All three lawsuits pending against BHP Billiton in 2002 have been dismissed . The money may reach more politically acceptable pockets , but the mine is still " absolutely disastrous " in environmental terms , says Don Henry , executive director of the Australian Conservation Foundation . <p> Back in Africa , in thoroughly civilized Cape Town , diamond giant DeBeers Group finds itself in the crosshairs of the South African government . In an attempt to create jobs and keep more of the diamond cutting and polishing business at home , Parliament is considering a law to create a state diamond trader . This entity would likely force DeBeers and other producers to sell it a certain percentage of diamonds at " fair market value " and would then presumably sell the diamonds to the regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the diamond polishing is currently done in India and China . <p> The proposed law also would tack a 15% export duty on certain diamonds , depending on their quality . " With a 15% export duty and a possible partial theft of some of DeBeers ' production , this new legislation could certainly reduce DeBeers ' mining operations , " says diamond consultant Richard Wake-Walker , adding that smuggling  --  always an industry curse  --  would be encouraged . Michael Bedford , analyst at Barnard Jacobs Mellet Securities , says the South African government is " overreacting in its attempts to rein in DeBeers . " DeBeers diplomatically says it " shares the government 's goals of a transformed industry . " <p> DeBeers knows how to persevere with potentates  --  it managed to profitably get rough diamonds out of Zaire when Mobutu was ruling the roost and lining his pockets  --  but this game is no fun if the government captures all of the potential profit . A Tale of Greedy Governments <p> <p> From the Soviets in 1917 through Libya 's Muammar Qaddafi , governments have seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even mothball them . More recently strongmen like Venezuela 's Hugo Chvez leave the risk with private operators but demand a bigger slice of profits as commodity prices rise . 1917 <p> The Soviet nationalizes foreign oil companies following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia . 1938 <p> Mexican President Lzaro Crdenas seizes 17 foreign oil companies operating in Mexico . Later the government pays $130 million in compensation . 1951 <p> Iran nationalizes British firm Anglo-Iranian , the predecessor of today 's BP. 1968 <p> Zaire 's president , Mobutu Sese Seko , takes over Miba , a subsidiary of Belgian mining company Sibeka. 1969 <p> President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia nationalizes Anglo American 's thriving copper mines . 1971-72 <p> Libya assumes the operations of BP and Bunker Hunt , and grabs 51% stakes in Occidental Petroleum and other U.S. oil companies in the nation . 1979 <p> President Jimmy Carter imposes a windfall tax on oil profits . Raises a net $40 billion ( and imports ) till repealed in 1988. 2002 <p> U.K. hikes tax on profits of oil companies operating in the North Sea from 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and income taxes as well . <p> Bolivia passes law imposing new 32% tax on revenues of natural gas and oil producers . <p> Chile imposes new tax on copper production that ranges from 0.5% to 5% of operating profits , beginning in January 2006 . A World of Rule-Changers <p> <p> It 's one thing to change the terms of future oil or mining contracts . It 's quite another to shift the terms upon which original investments were made . The surge in commodity prices in recent years has led governments around the world to impose higher taxes , royalties and expert duties on copper , oil , natural gas and  --  now under consideration in South Africa  --  diamonds . ALASKA <p> In January 2005 Governor Frank H. Murkowski removed tax incentives from certain fields in the Prudhoe Bay region . TRINIDAD &; TOBAGO <p> Passed a law in October 2005 that removes various allowances for income tax and supplemental petroleum tax . In effect raising taxes for producers retroactive to 2004 . ARGENTINA <p> Raised export duties on oil twice in 2004 . The duty ranges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase . SOUTH AFRICA <p> Legislation is likely to be passed in December 2005 that creates a state diamond trader and may impose a 15% export duty on some diamonds . RUSSIA <p> Raised export duties in 2004 to 65% on oil above $25 a barrel . PAPUA NEW GUINEA <p> Australian mining giant BHP Billiton exited the Ok Tech copper mine in 2002 following years of environmental protests and lawsuits . INDONESIA <p> In late 2005 the government threatens to seize a $2 billion oilfield from ExxonMobil if it can not resolve a dispute with its partner , state oil company Pertamina . <p> MAP : World Map <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Protesters vs .
