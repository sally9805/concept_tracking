<p> Bechtel Corp. , the San Francisco construction giant known for its global reach and high-powered political connections , won a contract Thursday worth up to $680 million to rebuild Iraqi roads , schools , sewers and hospitals damaged in the war . <p> The contract , sought by the nation 's largest construction firms , places Bechtel squarely in the middle of U.S. efforts to reshape Iraq . <p> The company will repair Iraq 's waterworks , its electrical grid and its sewage systems . Bechtel also may dredge the seaport of Umm Qasr  --  gateway for food and medical supplies flowing into the country  --  as well as repair Iraq 's airports . <p> The U.S. Agency for International Development , in charge of picking companies for Iraq 's reconstruction , offered few details Thursday of why it chose Bechtel . The selection process , which was cloaked in secrecy because of national security concerns and which was open only to U.S. companies that were invited to bid by the government , angered critics in Congress and abroad . <p> Bechtel , however , pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle East as credentials for the job . The company has roughly 1,000 people stationed in the region . <p> " Bechtel is honored to have been asked by USAID to help bring humanitarian assistance , economic recovery and infrastructure reconstruction to the Iraqi people , " Tom Hash , president of Bechtel National , said in a prepared statement Thursday . " We will now begin meeting with USAID to start detailed planning on this important effort . " <p> IRAQIS MAY BE INVOLVED <p> Although the company offered few details of its plans , spokesman Michael Kidder said Bechtel was meeting with USAID to prioritize the work , determining which of the many tasks had to be handled first . The firm then will seek subcontractors to help , a process Kidder said would be open to companies from other nations . <p> American taxpayers will pay for the initial costs of the contract , but Iraqi oil revenue may eventually pay for much of the reconstruction . <p> USAID raised the possibility that some of the work would go to Iraqis , saying in a press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to build local capacity . " An agency spokeswoman , however , said USAID had no authority to require that Bechtel hire subcontractors from any specific country . <p> The contract is the largest for Iraq 's reconstruction so far awarded by USAID , which has also hired companies to piece back together the country 's education system and run the Umm Qasr seaport . Although the government may spend $680 million on the contract during the next 18 months , the initial award to Bechtel Thursday was far smaller , totaling $34.6 million . <p> Many predict , however , that the reconstruction job could lead to other lucrative work in Iraq , as the country rebuilds after decades of international sanctions and war . <p> " Presumably , if you are the first one in to do the initial work , the easiest thing to do is to say , ' OK , you get the next contract , ' " said Michael Tierney , visiting assistant professor of government at the College of William and Mary in Virginia , before Thursday 's announcement . " Whoever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bechtel 's decision to bid for the contract turned the company 's Beale Street headquarters into a flash point for protests in recent weeks . Demonstrators repeatedly tried to block the building 's entrance , saying Bechtel wanted to make money from war . <p> " They use the word reconstruction , " said Patrick Reinsborough , an organizer with Direct Action to Stop the War . " To us , this appears much more a second invasion of Iraq , a carving up of the country by U.S. corporations . " <p> The government 's process of picking companies to rebuild Iraq drew its own protests . <p> Foreign firms resented being shut out . Government watchdogs noted that all six of the companies bidding on the contract Bechtel won Thursday donated heavily to American politicians  --  $3.6 million between 1999 and 2002 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . Most of the money went to Republicans . Bechtel and its employees contributed $1.3 million to federal campaigns and candidates over the past three years , with 59 percent going to Republicans and the rest to Democrats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had powerful friends . <p> Bechtel 's corporate board includes George Shultz , secretary of state during the Reagan administration . Riley Bechtel , the firm 's chairman and chief executive , was recently appointed to President Bush 's export council . Caspar Weinberger was a Bechtel director , vice president and general counsel before become Reagan 's secretary of defense in 1980 . <p> Fluor Corp. , one of Bechtel 's top competitors for the job , boasts as a board member retired Adm . Bobby Inman , former head of the National Security Agency and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency . Last year , Fluor also hired a former Army official who oversaw the Pentagon 's procurement program . <p> " It raises the possibility that the companies specially invited to bid on this huge government contract were those with deep pockets and strong connections , " said Steven Weiss , spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics . " And companies that may have been just as qualified but did n't have as much money or did n't have the connections were n't invited . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For over 100 years , we 've been known as builders , and we 're known as the best , " Bechtel 's Kidder said . " If you look at our record , it 's our performance that 's the bedrock of our success . " <p> In addition to Bechtel and Fluor , the government reportedly also invited Louis Berger Group Inc. , Parsons Corp. , Washington Group International Inc. and a subsidiary of Halliburton Co. to bid on the reconstruction work . <p> Bechtel 's connections run to the top of USAID . The agency 's director , Andrew Natsios , briefly ran Boston 's Big Dig , a mammoth project in which Bechtel and another construction firm are burying miles of freeway beneath the city 's downtown . Massachusetts politicians have blamed Bechtel and its partner for allowing costs to balloon on the $14.6 billion effort . <p> Natsios ' experience with Bechtel , however , probably would not have made a difference in the company 's bid for Iraq reconstruction work . Although he heads the agency , he does not pick the companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procurement specialist and two independent panels . <p> BECHTEL 'S WORK DATES TO WWII <p> Iraq wo n't be the first Middle Eastern country reshaped by Bechtel . <p> The company first started working in the Persian Gulf during World War II and never left . Bechtel built or expanded early refineries in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia to feed the allies ' need for fuel . <p> After the war , Bechtel stretched a pipeline 850 miles across the desolate Saudi desert to Jordan . The company built an electrical plant to light the Saudi capital of Riyadh , linked the city to the Persian Gulf with a new railroad and later added an airport . Muslim pilgrims from Jidda travel to the holy city of Mecca on a Bechtel-built highway . <p> When coalition forces drove Iraq 's army from Kuwait in 1991 , much of the cleanup work fell to Bechtel . <p> The company was one of several that extinguished oil wells set ablaze by the Iraqis and mopped up lakes of crude spilled into the desert . When the fires were out , Bechtel took the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminals trashed by retreating soldiers . <p> Mary Ann Tetreault , a professor of international affairs at Trinity University in Texas , visited Kuwait before and after Iraq 's invasion . Many Kuwaitis , she said , were convinced Bechtel had paid off the royal family to win the contract , a perception Bechtel denies . Although Bechtel wo n't say how much it received , most estimates put the contract 's worth at roughly $2 billion . <p> And yet , Tetreault praised Bechtel 's handling of the job itself . <p> " It was extremely smooth , very professional , very fast , " she said . " And other than the political wrangles over who got paid off by whom for what , there were no complaints about the quality of the work .
