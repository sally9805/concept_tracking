A decade ago , European designer outlet malls fell into two categories : bad and worse . The handful that existed were mainly grubby places in France and Italy . Not surprisingly , they were n't too popular , and retailing experts said that proved Europeans were suspicious of discount malls and cut-rate goods . But why were American outlet centers crammed with holidaying Europeans snatching up bargain brands by the suitcaseload ? Washington developer J.W. ( Joe ) Kaempfer has provided the answer : Old World shoppers appreciate browsing for top-label goods at deep-discount prices , even at home  --  so long as the place they do their shopping has style . <P> Kaempfer , 52 , has shown Europe that discounting can be done with panache . Since 1993 , his company , BAA McArthurGlen , has opened nine snazzy malls in Britain , France and Austria , and it plans to move soon into Germany , Italy and the Netherlands . Thanks to Kaempfer 's vision , millions of Europeans can comfortably shop at places like the Parndorf Designer Outlet , east of Vienna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for huge savings on brand names like Nike and Gap . " BAA McArthurGlen is the pioneer of pan-European outlet shopping , " says Clive Minihan , director of the Credo Group , a developer of retail and new-media business in London . Pioneering has paid off . BAA McArthurGlen has grown from scratch to a sizable ( revenues of $472.3 million in the fiscal year ending March 31 ) behemoth that must now contend with upstart rivals trying to match its accomplishments . <P> Success has not come easily . Compared with the openness of doing business in America , Europe 's zoning procedures are often lengthy , land is costly and red tape plentiful . " In the States , real estate is location , location , location . In Europe , it 's politics , politics , politics , " Kaempfer wryly notes . His initial plans are almost always opposed by local retailers who fear loss of trade . It took four years of court squabbles , which set his company back $15 million in design and legal fees , before Kaempfer was cleared to break ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall . Kaempfer understands local concerns but calls them misplaced . " We 're not threatening anybody , " he asserts , because outlet sales are no more than 3% of the European retail pie . <P> He 's proving his point in Ashford , a thriving , small city some 35 miles south of London . In March , BAA McArthurGlen opened a mall there , and it is drawing 60,000 shoppers a week seeking everything from leisurewear to luggage at bargain rates . Ashford 's downtown retailers were nervous at first , admits Jo James , manager of the local Chamber of Commerce . But so far , losses to traditional retailers have been " minimal , on the whole around 1% . " Moreover , James explains , the mall draws mostly shoppers from outside the region who would n't normally shop in Ashford at all .
