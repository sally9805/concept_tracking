Chapter One He should n't have taken the shortcut . Bahzell Bahnakson realized that the instant he heard the sounds drifting down the inky-dark cross corridor . He 'd had to keep to the back ways used only by the palace servants-and far more numerous slaves-if he wanted to visit Brandark without the Guard 's knowledge , for he was too visible to come and go openly without being seen . But he should n't have risked the shortcut just to avoid the more treacherous passages of the old keep . He stood in an ill-lit hall heavy with the stink of its sparse torches ( the expensive oil lamps were saved for Churnazh and his " courtiers " ) , and his mobile , foxlike ears strained at the faint noises . Then they flattened in recognition , and he cursed . Such sounds were none of his business , he told himself , and keeping clear of trouble was . Besides , they were far from the first screams he 'd heard in Navahk ... and there 'd been nothing a prince of rival Hurgrum could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dagger hilt , and his jaw clenched with the anger he dared not show his " hosts . " Bahzell had never considered himself squeamish , even for a hradani , but that was before his father sent him here as an envoy . As a hostage , really , Bahzell admitted grimly . Prince Bahnak 's army had crushed Navahk and its allies , yet Hurgrum was only a single city-state . She lacked the manpower to occupy her enemies ' territories , though many a hradani chieftain would have let his own realm go to ruin by trying to add the others to it . But Bahnak was no ordinary chieftain . He knew there could be no lasting peace while Churnazh lived , yet he was wise enough to know what would happen if he dispersed his strength in piecemeal garrisons , each too weak to stand alone . He could defeat Navahk and its allies in battle ; to conquer them he needed time to bind the allies his present victories had attracted to him , and he 'd bought that time by tying Churnazh and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense clauses , and contingencies a Purple Lord would have been hard put to unravel . Half a dozen mutually suspicious hradani warlords found the task all but impossible , and to make certain they kept trying rather than resorting to more direct ( and traditional ) means of resolution , Bahnak had insisted on an exchange of hostages . It was simply Bahzell 's ill fortune that Navahk , as the most powerful of Hurgrum 's opponents , was entitled to a hostage from Hurgrum 's royal family . Bahzell understood , but he wished , just this once , that he could have avoided the consequences of being Bahnak 's son . Bad enough that he was a Horse Stealer , towering head and shoulders above the tallest of the Bloody Sword tribes and instantly identifiable as an outsider . Worse that Hurgrum 's crushing victories had humiliated Navahk , which made him an instantly hated outsider . Yet both of those things were only to be expected , and Bahzell could have lived with them , if only Navahk were n't ruled by Prince Churnazh , who not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but despised them as degenerate , over-civilized weaklings , as well . His cronies and hangers-on aped their prince 's attitude and , predictably , each vied with the other to prove his contempt was deeper than any of his fellows ' . So far , Bahzell 's hostage status had kept daggers out of his back and his own sword sheathed , but no hradani was truly suited to the role of diplomat , and Bahzell had come to suspect he was even less suited than most . It might have been different somewhere else , but holding himself in check when Bloody Swords tossed out insults that would have cost a fellow Horse Stealer blood had worn his temper thin . He wondered , sometimes , if Churnazh secretly wanted him to lose control , wanted to drive Bahzell into succumbing to the Rage in order to free himself from the humiliating treaties ? Or was it possible Churnazh truly believed his sneer that the Rage had gone out of Hurgrum , leaving her warriors gutless as water ? It was hard to be sure of anything where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . He hated and despised Prince Bahnak , and his contempt for the changes Bahnak had wrought in Hurgrum was boundless . That Bahzell understood , after a fashion , for he , too , was hradani . He understood the craving for battle , the terrible hot hunger of the Rage , and he shared his people 's disdain for weakness . But he had no use for blind stupidity , either , and what he could n't understand was how Churnazh could continue to think Bahnak a fool . Churnazh might sneer at Hurgrum as a city of shopkeepers who 'd forgotten how to be warriors , but surely even he did n't think it had been pure luck that Hurgrum had won every battle ! Of course , as a lad Bahzell himself had questioned some of his father 's more peculiar notions . What need did a warrior have of reading and writing or arithmetic ? Why worry about tradesmen and artisans or silly things like laws governing money-lending or property rights ? Where was the honor in learning to hold formation instead of charging forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And-despite himself , Bahzell smiled a little in memory , even now-surely bathing every single week would ruin a man 's constitution ! But he questioned no more . Hurgrum 's army had n't simply defeated five times its own numbers ; it had slaughtered them and driven their survivors from the field in a rabble , and it had done so because it fought as a disciplined unit . Because its maps were accurate and the commanders of its fast-marching contingents , or at least their aides , could read the orders their prince sent them and close in upon their enemies in coordinated attacks . And because it was uniformly trained , because its warriors did keep formation and were equipped with weapons of its own city 's manufacture from the hands and forges of the " shopkeepers " Churnazh despised . That was a lesson even other Horse Stealers could appreciate , which explained the new allies Hurgrum was gathering in , but since seeing Navahk , Bahzell had come to recognize an even more enduring side of his father 's accomplishments . Prince Bahnak 's native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet Navahk was worse than Hurgrum had ever been . Far worse . It was a place of noisome streets cluttered with garbage , night soil , and small dead animals , heavy with the stench of unwashed people and waiting pestilence , all presided over by swaggering bullies in the colors of the prince who was supposed to rule his people , not plunder them himself ! But , then , Churnazh had been a common brigand before he joined the Navahkan army , rose through the ranks , and seized the throne , and he was proud of the brute strength that proved his right to rule . Strength Bahzell could appreciate ; weakness was beneath contempt , and he knew his father could n't have held his own throne if his warriors thought for one moment that he was a weakling . But in Churnazh 's eyes , " strength " rested upon terror . His endless wars had made Navahk the most feared of all the Bloody Sword cities , yet Navahk herself was terrified of him ... and his five sons were even worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hostage from Hurgrum had any business doing was standing in this hall listening to screams and even considering intervening . Besides , whoever was screaming was only another Bloody Sword , and , with the noteworthy exception of Brandark , there was n't a Bloody Sword worth the time to send him to Phrobus , much less risk his own life for . Bahzell told himself that with all the hardheaded pragmatism he could summon ... then swore vilely and started down the unlit corridor . Crown Prince Harnak grinned as he smashed his fist into Farmah 's face yet again . Her gagged scream was weaker and less satisfying than it had been , but his metal-reinforced gauntlet cut fresh , bleeding gashes , and he felt a sensual thrill of power even greater than he 'd felt when he raped her . He let her slip to the floor , let her try to crawl away with her arms bound behind her , then kicked her in the ribs . The shredded chemise wadded into her mouth muffled her gurgling shriek as his boot smashed her into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought she was too good for a prince of the blood , did she ? Well , she 'd learned better now , had n't she ? He watched her curl in a beaten ball and savored her hopeless terror . Rape was the one crime that might turn even his father 's men against him , but no one would ever know who 'd had this slut . When they found her body and saw all the things he 'd done-and still looked forward to doing-they 'd assume exactly what he wanted : that someone taken by the Rage 's blood frenzy had slaughtered her like a sow , and-An abrupt explosion of rending wood shattered his hungry anticipation and snatched him around in shock . The long abandoned sleeping chamber 's locked door was thick , as stout and well built as any door in Navahk was likely to be , but its latch simply disappeared in a cloud of splinters , and the door itself slammed back against the wall so hard one iron hinge snapped . Harnak jumped back in instant panic , mind already racing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of discovery , but then his eyes widened as he saw who stood in the opening . That towering figure could not be mistaken for anyone else , but it was alone , and Harnak snarled in contemptuous relief as the intruder glanced at the naked , battered girl huddled against the wall . Big he might be , but Bahzell of Hurgrum was no threat . The puling , puking coward had hidden behind his " hostage " status for over two years , swallowing insults no warrior would let pass ... and he was armed only with a dagger , while Harnak 's sword lay ready on the rotting bed . Bahzell would never raise his hand to the heir to Navahk 's throne-especially if it meant matching eighteen inches of steel against forty ! - and even if he carried the tale to others , no one in Navahk would dare take his word over that of a prince of the blood . Particularly if Harnak saw to it that Farmah had vanished before the Horse Stealer could get back with help . He straightened his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits to order the intruder out , but the words died unspoken as Bahzell 's eyes moved back to him . There was something in them Harnak had never seen before ... and Bahzell was n't stopping in the doorway . A ball of ice froze in Harnak 's belly . He had time to feel one sudden stab of terror , to abandon his swaggering posture and leap desperately for his sword , and then an iron clamp seized him by the throat . Shouting for help would have done him no good-he 'd chosen this spot so no one would hear his victim 's screams-but he never got the chance to try , for his cry died in a wheezing gurgle as the clamp lifted his toes from the floor . He writhed and choked , beating at Bahzell 's wrist with his gauntleted hands , and then another hand-not a clamp , this one , but a spiked mace-crashed into his belly . Harnak screamed as three ribs snapped . The sound was faint and strangled ... and dwarfed by the sound he made when a knee like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world vanished in agony so great he hardly noticed the mace crashing into his belly again . And then again and again and again . But he retained enough awareness to realize what was happening as Bahzell released his throat at last . The choking hand clasped the nape of his neck instead . Another hand caught his belt , and Crown Prince Harnak of Navahk screamed in terror ... until he smashed face-first into the dirty little chamber 's wall and the impact cut his shriek off like a knife . He oozed down the stone , smearing it with red , and Bahzell snarled and started forward to finish the job . The Horse Stealer 's muscles quivered as fury snapped and sputtered through them , but sanity still flickered , and he made himself stop . He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply , fighting back the red haze . It was n't easy , but the killing madness ebbed without quite passing over into the Rage , and he shook himself . He opened his eyes once more and looked down , grimacing at the knuckles he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turned to Harnak 's latest victim . She writhed away in terror , too battered and beaten to realize he was n't Harnak , but then she felt the gentleness of his touch and whimpered . " There , lass . There , " he murmured , bitterly aware of how useless the soothing sounds were yet making them anyway , and her frantic struggles eased . One eye opened , staring fearfully up at him , but the other was swollen shut , and the cheek below it was clearly broken . He touched her hair gently , and disgust filled him as he recognized her cut and bloody face . Farmah . Who but Harnak-or his brothers-would rape a mere girl supposedly under his own father 's protection ? He lifted her , and bleak hate filled his eyes at her pain sound when broken ribs shifted . Her hands were bound behind her , and fresh contempt snarled through him as he recalled Harnak 's swaggering bluster about courage and hardihood . Courage , it seemed , required a " warrior " to bind a teenaged girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he raped her and beat her bloody ! He eased her into a sitting position on a battered old chest against the wall . It was filthy , but the only other furnishing was the bed Harnak had raped her upon . She shuddered in terror and pain , yet she leaned forward to help as he cut the cord that had flayed her wrists raw and plucked the wad of cloth from her mouth . Returning intelligence flickered in her good eye . " Thank you , M'lord , " she whispered . " Thank you ! " Her hand rose and squeezed his wrist with surprising strength . Or perhaps not so surprising , for she , too , was hradani , however slim and delicate she might be compared to Bahzell . " Hush , girl . Do n't be thanking me , " Bahzell rumbled , and looked away from her nakedness in sudden embarrassment . He spied Harnak 's discarded cloak and scooped it up , averting his eyes as he held it out to her , and her sound as she took it was trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twisted ghost of a laugh . It snarled deep inside Bahzell , that sound , striking fresh sparks of fury . He bought a few moments to reassert control by ripping a length of cloth from Harnak 's none too clean shirt and wrapping it around his bleeding knuckles , but the delay was little help , and his hand itched for his dagger once more as he glared down at Harnak . Rape . The one crime not even the Rage could excuse , even in Navahk . Continues ...
