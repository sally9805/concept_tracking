Maj. Sara Brannon arrived at her office fifteen minutes before she was due to report to Gen. Henry Powhatan Clarke . She sorted through her mail , looking for a letter from Kevin Kerney . There was no envelope with either a New Mexico postmark or his familiar scrawl . Disappointed , Sara set the mail aside , took off her fatigue jacket , and glanced at her wristwatch . It was evening in Santa Fe , New Mexico , and she wondered if Kerney was home from work . With the demands of his job as deputy chief of the New Mexico State Police and his gloomy description of the small guest house he was renting , she doubted he spent much time at home . Both Kerney and she were working long , hard hours in pressure-cooker jobs , and camping out in less than inviting quarters . Late March in South Korea had brought a series of cloudy , dreary days that made spring seem a long way off . Sara yearned for sunshine and home . But with several months remaining on her tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her office desk faced a full wall of situation maps documenting all recent North Korean DMZ incursions , infiltrations , and violations . As commander of allied G-2 ground reconnaissance and intelligence units , she was directly responsible for monitoring North Korean troop activity along and inside the DMZ . Her squads had to catch whatever the electronic eyes in the sky missed . Sara routinely accompanied the patrols to assess their effectiveness and efficiency . For the last forty-six years , battle-ready armies had faced each other across a swath of rugged mountains two-and-a-half miles wide and a hundred-and-fifty miles long that cut across the Korean peninsula , keeping the zonor the full moon to set . Under cover of darkness , Sara spread her people out and put the area under close surveillance . For hours nothing moved , but Sara sensed that the North Koreans were up to something . She ordered a ground sweep into the village . As Sara and her team crawled across the clearing , automatic weapon fire opened up from three hidden positions , taking out her point man . Sara popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the infantry platoon stationed behind the wire , and kept the team moving forward as rounds whined overhead . The green dots from the AK-47 tracers , the red dots from the M-60 machine-gun tracers , and the searing white of the flares cast carnival colors across the night sky . Using rocket grenade launchers , the team took out two of the positions and stormed the third , capturing a wounded North Korean soldier . As Sara pulled back with the wounded North Korean and two shot-up team members , the enemy answered with return fire from behind the village . Another soldier took a round in the exchange , but Sara got everyone out . They hit the safety of the fence and a bank of ten-thousand-watt spotlights lit up the village . All shooting stopped . Sara stayed with her wounded until the medics got them stabilized and ready to airlift . Then she reported to the command bunker . A South Korean infantry officer was on the telephone in a terse exchange with his opposite number on the other side of the DMZ . The officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side an immediate stand-down by the North Koreans . At dawn , Sara took a platoon of infantry back into the DMZ to inspect the area . They found three tunnels with shielded ceilings to block any traces of body heat that could be detected by satellites . Dug from the North Korean boundary the tunnels ran to within five hundred feet of the viewing platform that looked over the DMZ , and were positioned to rake the viewing platform in a cross fire . Commando sniper rifles with silencers and telescopic sights were retrieved from the tunnels . Then each tunnel was sealed and destroyed with explosives . As a result of the thwarted assassination plans , the secretary of state 's DMZ visit was cancelled . Weeks later , Sara was still waiting to hear what the CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency had to say about the incident . The Beltway spy shops had taken full control of the investigation and dropped a heavy security blanket over the episode . Since the fire-fight , most of Sara 's time had been spent either undergoing intense questioning by teams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had put her people in for commendations and medals , but had n't heard a word back through the chain of command . Perhaps the incident would be buried so deep that there 'd be no recognition of her team 's outstanding performance . Such a morale-buster would n't make the rest of her tour any easier . She would have to think of ways to keep the unit 's performance at a peak . Sara looked at her wristwatch again . She had five minutes before her meeting with General Clarke . She put on her fatigue jacket and walked across the street to the headquarters building . Upon assuming command of Combined Forces in Korea , Gen. Henry Powhatan Clarke had taken one look at his senior staff dressed in their Class-B headquarters uniforms and issued his first order , making fatigues the duty dress of the day for all personnel regardless of rank or assignment . As commander in chief of a combat-ready army , Clarke wanted the staff that would run the war and the line soldiers who would fight it dressed , equipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first of many changes Clarke made to hone his army to a high state of readiness . In a rare exception to his own policy , General Clarke had worn his Class-A uniform to work . His schedule for the day included a meeting with the United States ambassador and senior members of the embassy staff . Of all the ribbons he wore above his left jacket pocket , his most prized was the Good Conduct Ribbon , awarded only to enlisted personnel . Serving in Vietnam at the age of twenty , Henry Powhatan Clarke had won a competitive service appointment to West Point , and had graduated in time to return as platoon leader during the 1968 Tet Offensive . At his desk , Clarke thumbed through the Defense Intelligence Agency report that had been delivered to his quarters late last night by a special Pentagon courier . The contents of the report , along with a letter and attached orders from the secretary of defense , had prompted his request to have Maj. Sara Brannon report to him . A knock at the open door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front of his desk . " Come in , Major , " he said , gesturing toward the two army-issue , metal straight-back office chairs that , by design , made long sit-down sessions almost unbearable . Clarke liked short meetings that got his people up and moving as quickly as possible . " Thank you , sir , " Sara answered as she sat in the butt-numbing chair with more grace and ease than Clarke would have imagined possible . &lt; She watched as the general gathered papers from the desk and sat , thick brown hair that curled slightly at the ends . Sara met his gaze directly . Clarke knew that Maj. Brannon was an exceptional officer . Any man who only saw her good looks  --  her sparkling green eyes , strawberry blond hair , and the mischievous line of freckles across her nose  --  would be seriously underestimating her . " We finally received a conclusive Intelligence report on the sniper operation , " General Clarke said . " A North Korean diplomat defected and confirmed the assassination plot was mounted by a fanatical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force Kim Jung II into a war with South Korea . " Sara nodded and waited . " The three snipers had orders to kill the South Korean president , the secretary of state , and me . " Henry Powhatan Clarke smiled . " Personally , I like to think that shooting an American four-star general would have pushed us into a war . " " I 'm glad that did n't happen , sir , " Sara said , smiling back . " So am I , Major . I understand you 've been asking my chief of staff about the status of your request for promotions and commendations for your team . " " I have , sir . " " I like an officer who goes to bat for her people . " " They 've earned the recognition , General , " Sara said . " Agreed , Major , " General Clarke said , as he put some papers in Sara 's hands . " Each enlisted rank gets a meritorious promotion and the Army Commendation Medal . Additionally , the wounded men receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " Sara said breaking into a smile as she scanned the orders and citation documents . &lt; " There 's more , " General Clarke said , handing Sara another sheet of paper . " At the request of the secretary of state , and upon the recommendation of the secretary of defense , you are to receive the Distinguished Service Medal . " Stunned into silence , Sara read the citation . Finally , she raised her glance . " I do n't know what to say . " " Congratulations , Colonel Brannon . " " Excuse me ? " Sara said incredulously , forgetting protocol . General Clarke laughed . " We could n't promote everyone else on the team and leave you out , now could we ? I ca n't think of anybody in your academy class who is walking around as a light colonel . " " A few are on the short list , General . " " Well , you 'll have seniority over all of them . You 'll get orders for your next duty assignment within the week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? " " After you report from leave , you 'll be attending the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth . " " I was n't scheduled to attend C and GS until next year , " Sara said . " We ca n't have a highly decorated , new light colonel running around without her C and GS College ticket punched , " General Clarke replied with a warm smile . " You 'll need it in your personnel jacket for your next promotion to full colonel . Considering that you kept the North Koreans from sending me home in a bodybag , it was the least I could do . " " Thank you , sir . " " No sweat , Colonel . Meet me at the Officers ' Club tonight at twenty hundred hours . I 'll pin on those silver oak leaves and douse them with beer , as tradition demands . " " I 'll be there , General . " General Clarke stood and walked to his office door . " Any time you want to return to my command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want nothing but stud officers serving with me , and I do n't give a damn what gender they are . " Sara stood outside the headquarters building in the drizzle paying no attention to the enlisted personnel who walked past snapping off salutes . She recovered her composure and started moving in the direction of G-2 , across the street . A convoy of troop carriers held her up . Sara remained on the sidewalk after the convoy rumbled by , trying to calculate the miles from Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , to Santa Fe . She guessed it to be seven hundred miles . It certainly put Kerney within striking distance . She smiled as a thought crossed her mind . They had been writing to each other more frequently as the time for her to rotate stateside grew closer , making plans for a visit . Maybe she 'd just show up in Santa Fe unannounced and early . Sara 's smile turned into a slightly wicked grin . She had hammered her sexuality into submission by working eighteen-hour days and avoiding even those men who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole sex issue had been the most realistic way to survive with her career intact in a combat-ready command , and she was damn tired of abstinence . A young soldier gave Sara a salute and a sidelong glance as he passed by , and Sara wiped the grin off her face . The cloudy day had turned cold . Sara zipped up her fatigue jacket , yearning for the dry desert heat that she 'd bitched so much about during her tour of duty at White Sands Missile Range . She stepped off the sidewalk and hurried to find her Field Intelligence and Reconnaissance Unit squad leaders . She wanted to be the first to tell her people about the promotions and citations before word le aked out from other sources . Then she 'd finish her workday and celebrate after General Clarke pinned on the silver oak leaves that evening . It was , Lt. Col. Sara Brannon thought , one of the best days in her ten years as an officer in the United States Army . Kevin Kerney sat in the passenger seat of Dale Jennings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend from the Tularosa Basin drove down a San Miguel County dirt road in Northern New Mexico , about fifty miles due east of Santa Fe . It was an unusually warm and pretty early April morning , but Kerney was n't paying any attention to the weather or the vistas . His thoughts were on Erma Fergurson . Erma was his mother 's college roommate and lifelong friend . When his parents died in an auto accident over twenty-five years ago , Erma became one of the few people left in Kerney 's life with a link to his boyhood on his family 's Tularosa ranch . Erma taught art at the state university in Las Cruces for almost forty years . After her retirement , she became one of the most renowned landscape artists of the Southwest . She 'd never married , never had children . Kerney had last seen Erma in November on a visit to Las Cruces . In her seventies , she remained a head-turner . She was vibrant , vital , elegant , and classy . They went out to dinner , reminisced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years when Erma served as his surrogate mother . A massive stroke had killed Erma in early February , and now Kerney was about to take his second look at the ten sections of high country ranch land she had left to him . He 'd known that Erma owned property she once used as a summer retreat . But the size of it  --  6,400 acres  --  came as a complete surprise , as did her bequest of the land and the old cabin that stood on it . Kerney glanced quickly at Dale , now the last living person connected to Kerney 's childhood years on the ranch . Dale 's arm rested on the open window and he steered the truck with one hand . His fingers were blunt and calloused , and his long forehead , covered by the bill of a cap pulled low , hid his thinning hair . His closely cropped sideburns showed a hint of gray and his face was weathered from years working in the scorching sun of southern New Mexico . Dale ranched near the Tularosa , on land handed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor and best boyhood friend . They passed through the village of Ojitos Frios . An adobe church and a cluster of homes  --  some of stone and others coated with cement or plastered with stucco  --  sat among irrigated fields that rimmed the base of flat-topped Tecolote Peak . The small valley seemed frozen in the late nineteenth century . " What is this place ? " Dale asked as he drove through the settlement . " What ? " Kerney asked . " What 's the name of this place ? " " Ojitos Frios . " Dale glanced at Kerney with amused brown eyes . " What 's so funny ? " Kerney asked . " Cold Springs , huh ? If we find one , maybe I 'll give you a good dunking to wake you up . " " I 'm here , " Kerney replied . " Not hardly , " Dale said . " You 've been off in dreamland since I rolled up to your door early this morning . " Kerney laughed . " I guess I have . I still ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That lady loved you like a son , " Dale said . Up ahead a fast moving stream ran across a dip in the road . He dropped the transmission into low gear and rattled the truck through the water , keeping an eye on the trailer hitched to the truck . The trailer held two horses Dale had brought up from his ranch in the San Andres Mountains . One of the animals , Soldier , was a mustang Kerney had trained and later named in honor of his dead godson , Sammy Yazzi . Sammy had been murdered while serving in the army at White Sands Missile Range , on land that once belonged to Kerney 's family . Working with Sara Brannon , an army officer at the base , Kerney solved the crime , and the men responsible for Sammy 's murder were dead . Even though Kerney had given Soldier to him , Dale always planned to return the horse . Now , maybe soon he could . Across the stream , the road curved and climbed the crest of a small hill that opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see deep erosion furrows , a sure sign of poor range management . " Where exactly is this mesa you now own ? " Dale inquired . " A little farther down the road , " Kerney answered , starting to feel a bit antsy . Only three weeks had passed since he 'd been informed of Erma 's bequest of the land and the cabin , and due to the demands of his job as deputy state police chief , he 'd been able to manage just one quick trip up from Santa Fe to look over his unexpected windfall . What Kerney had seen looked promising . The foot of the low mesa held rich grassland , and a live stream wandered near a ramshackle cabin . But most of the land was on the mesa , and Kerney did n't have a clue what to expect in the high country . With Dale supplying the horses and coming along for the ride , Kerney planned to see it all before the weekend ended . The road turned east then north as the valley widened , and a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed steep slopes . Beyond , the Sangre de Cristo Mountains rolled back into the horizon , peaks still capped in deep snow . " That 's my mesa , " Kerney said , when the cabin came into view . " That 's a pretty dinky mesa , " Dale replied , tongue in cheek . " Do n't be a spoilsport , " Kerney said . He directed Dale through the open gate and got out of the truck as soon it came to a stop . Dale eyed the cabin from the cab of his truck . Old stone walls sagged under a rusted , pitched tin roof . The front door and small windows were boarded up with scrap lumber . It looked completely useless . He heard the sound of hoofs on metal and left the truck to find Kerney leading the horses out of the trailer and down the ramp . " In a hurry ? " Dale asked as he reached for Pancho 's halter . Pancho was his best trail horse , sure-footed and with endurance suited for long rides . Soldier stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trailer . " You bet I am , " Kerney said , reaching for the riding tack in the trailer storage compartment . Dale stretched his back to ease the tightness from the long drive and looked around . Off in the distance , he could see the outline of Hermit 's Peak , two massive summits that stood like the hindquarters of a prehistoric animal . His gaze traveled to some smaller button-nose peaks that dipped off at the front end , and suddenly Hermit 's Peak looked like an upturned face with a gaping mouth staring into the sky . He switched his gaze to Kerney and found him saddled and mounted . " Let 's get going , " Kerney said . " Slow down , cowboy . " " Slow down , shit , " Kerney said with a grin . " I want to cover it all before sundown . Saddle up . " Dale grinned back . It had been a long time sin ce he 'd seen Kerney look so damn happy . An old ranch road petered out at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a dense thicket of juniper and pion pine trees . Halfway up the trail got rocky , and the horses picked their way carefully through loose stones and small boulders . They hit the top and encountered a stand of young ponderosas that gradually thickened into a dense climax forest . Kerney turned to look at the rolling valley below . His eyes followed the cuts defining the deep running streams that converged in the village of San Geronimo . Nestled in a shallow depression , the village was mostly in ruins , kept barely alive by the few ranching families who still lived there . The church stood , as did a vacant school and a few homes . But the remaining buildings were weathered empty shells surrounded by piles of hand-cut stone rubble . The hills beyond the village cut off from view all but the uppermost third of Hermit 's Peak , and the mountain looked like two giant loaves of homemade bread set out to cool on a windowsill . " Every time I look at that mountain , it seems different , " Kerney said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale said , buttoning his jacket . A broad stream of clouds blocked the sun and chilled down the air . " It will be the last nice view we have if these woodlands do n't give way to some open country pretty soon . " " You do n't like fighting your way through the brush ? " " Nope . Reminds me too much of work . " " Pray for open country , " Kerney said . They came out of the trees a thousand yards from the ridge line , where the ponderosas dwindled away and grassland took over . A barbed-wire fence barred their passage and they followed it , looking for an o pening . As he rode , Kerney eyed the wide mesa . There were small stands of pinon and juniper trees sprinkled over the land and folded rock outcroppings along the edges of shallow depressions . The land sloped westward and several wandering arroyos had cut through the thin layer of soil down to the rock plate before draining into intermittent catchment basins . From the map Erma 's lawyer and executor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerney knew there was no live water on the mesa . But two windmills tapped groundwater , and Kerney was eager to find them . If they were in working order , it would ease the expense of putting cattle on the land . They entered the grassland through an old cedar pole gate , and moved down an arroyo into a dry basin . The open range , Kerney guessed , took up four thousand acres of the ten section tract , and showed no sign of recent use . He figured the neighboring rancher who leased the grazing rights had decided to rest the land for a season or two . As they came out of the basin , Kerney caught sight of a windmill and stock tank . A black dog with brown stockings limped away from a grove of trees , carrying something in its mouth . Even from a good distance away , the dog looked skinny under its thickly matted fur . It heard the horses , stopped , turned , and retreated in the direction of the trees . Kerney could n't quite make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he closed in for a closer look the dog froze , dropped the object , skirted around Soldier , and scampered for cover , yelping in pain as it ran . " That pooch is n't doing too well , " Dale said . " It does n't seem so , " Kerney said as he broke Soldier into a trot toward the object on the ground . He looked down , fully exp ecting to see a dead rabbit . It was a chewed-up athletic shoe . He dismounted and retrieved it . It carried a name brand and seemed to be sized to fit a woman . The faded label inside the tongue , barely readable , confirmed it . Dale caught up , looked at the shoe in Kerney 's hand , and shook his head . " That dog sure is n't much of a hunter . A retriever , maybe . Do you want to leave it here and move on ? " " No , it 's hurt . Maybe it got dumped or left behind by campers . We 'll round it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying another shoe , moving as quickly as the lame hind leg allowed . Kerney took his boot out of the stirrup , looked up at Dale , made a face , and shook his head . " Now what ? " Dale asked . " A dog carrying one shoe I 'd call mildly curious . But a dog with two shoes piques my interest . " Dale laughed . " Maybe it just likes to collect shoes . " " Maybe . " Kerney looked around the empty mesa . " But from where ? " " Good point . " " Think you can fetch that dog for me ? " Kerney asked . " Sure thing , " Dale said , reaching for his rope . " Bring the shoe back with you . " " What are you going to do ? " " Check out that stand of trees . " " Do n't you ever stop thinking like a cop ? " Dale asked as he broke Pancho into a trot . " Probably not . " Kerney walked Soldier to a lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , looked into the shadows , and saw nothing . He pushed his way through some low branches , and knelt down on a thick mound of needles , letting his eyes adjust to the dim light . The dog had dug out a small hollow at the base of a pion tree . Kerney 's eye caught a touch of color in the loose dirt . Using a twig , he brushed away the dirt and uncovered a comb . He backed away and scanned the ground of the surrounding trees . He saw a scrap of fabric that looked like denim . Next to it was a half-buried bone , with a human foot still attached . Kerney had seen enough . Whatever else there was to be found , he would leave to a crime scene unit and the District State Police Office in Las Vegas . He came out of the grove as Dale rode up , carrying the dog over his saddle . " Find anything ? " Dale asked , as he handed Kerney the shoe . It matched the first one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with some human bones . " " No joke ? " " No joke . " " What are you going to do ? " " I left my cell phone in your truck . We 'll head back and call the district office . " " What about the dog ? It 's a neutered male . I make him to be about five or six years old . He needs a meal bad and he has a gimpy hip . " Kerney looked at the mutt . Mostly black , with brown markings around the eyes that matched his stockings , he had flecks of gray on his chest and a salt-and-pepper tail . He was hairy , filthy skinny , and scared . " I 'll keep him , " Kerney said impulsively . " You need to give him water , food , and a name , " Dale said . " I 'll call him Shoe , for now , " Kerney said , as he opened his saddlebags and reached for one of the sandwiches he had packed for lunch . He handed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupped his hands and Kerney poured water from his canteen into them . Shoe lapped it up and Kerney gave him more . He untied Soldier 's reins and mounted up . Dale held Shoe out to him . " He 's your dog . You might as well get used to his smell . " Kerney sided Soldier over to Dale , took the dog , put him across the saddle , sniffed , and wrinkled his nose . " We 'll head to that stock tan k and clean him up a bit before we turn back . " " Good idea , " Dale said . " We should still have part of the day to explore after things settle down . " " What happens next ? " " Officers and a crime scene unit will come out and search the area . " " Damn , I 'd like to see that . " " I 'm sure you will . " " You sound grumpy . " " This is not the way I wanted to spend my weekend . " " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always think the worst when people turn up dead . " " Maybe you should call this place Skeleton Mesa . " " That 's cute , Dale . " Dale shrugged his shoulders . " Just a suggestion . I think that dog likes you . " Shivers ran through the dog as it laid across the saddle . Kerney could feet it breathing heavily . He ran his hand over the dog 's back to calm him and scratched his ears . The dog looked at him with serious eyes . " Not yet . But I think he will . "
