Here are five battle-tested rules for surviving that dreaded " now what ? " stage of retirement . JIM DOWN 'S 85-YEAR-OLD MOTHER was n't happy for him when he retired . In fact , she cried . The former vice chairman of Mercer Management Consulting was only 50 when he stepped down in 2002  --  far too young , as far as Mom was concerned , to cross the finish line . Jim 's father , a Travelers insurance manager , retired at age 70 and had never been happy with all the free time on his hands . " To her , retirement is the end of the road , " says Down . " I had to convince her it was a new beginning . " First he had to convince himself . " It was scary , " he says . " I thought , Will I feel productive ? " Sure , he kicks back . Each summer he chooses a country and spends two weeks playing as much golf there as he can . Last fall he picked grapes in a Portuguese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has a sense of purpose  --  such as bringing business know-how to nonprofits like Oxfam America . " Retirement is better than I thought it was going to be , " he says . That is a big relief to his mother . But not every retiree in Down 's position is as lucky as he is . " I meet people who are struggling , " he says . " I know people who made money at an early age who do n't have much to do and do n't seem very happy . " People with money who are n't happy in retirement ? Nice problem if you can get it . We 're not going to kid you : Money , and plenty of it , is still one of the backbones of a long and contented rest of your life . But as much as you 've dreamed of the moment when you can finally tell your boss to take this job and  --  how to put this ?  --  allow somebody else the opportunity to bring a new vision and skill set to the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean instant bliss . " The first year after retirement is a quirky time , " says retirement guru Ken Dychtwald . " It 's a time of feeling enthusiastic and liberated . It 's also a time of turmoil . " And it 's gon na be great  --  once you get over the hump and start to create the life you 've always wanted . To help you get there , we 've put together some rules for making it through the first 12 months . TAKE A DEEP BREATH Remember , vegging has its benefits . Suddenly having a lot of free time can lead to regrettable choices  --  like starting ill-conceived businesses or making iffy stock investments just to fill the void . " If you rush off immediately to a gated community in Florida , you could miss out on the next big part of your life , " says Dave Corbett of New Directions , a firm that coaches senior execs through major life changes . How much time should you take ? As much as you need . For Louise Levine , 62 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ski trip to Whistler , B.C. , last January was enough before taking a gig at another pharmaceutical company . " I 'm happy I did n't take more time off , " she says . " My enjoyment in life is to work . " Gail MacDonald , a 50-year-old former section head of quality assurance for Procter &; Gamble , took a year after she retired in 2004 to decompress . During that time she stayed in Cincinnati and took advantage of the attractions she had always been meaning to try . She golfed the local courses Majestic Springs and Legendary Run and dined at Boca and Pigall 's . She planted flowers . " I had all 24 hours in the day , " she says . " I could go grocery shopping on a Tuesday afternoon instead of eight o'clock at night after work . " Three years later she 's now happily ensconced on North Carolina 's Outer Banks . " In that first year , I did n't make any big changes , " she says . " I allowed fate to take me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREE , SO DO N'T ASSUME YOU 'LL BE SPENDING LESS MONEY You know the rule of thumb  --  you 'll need 70% to 80% of your preretirement income to maintain the standard of living you had when you were working . After all , you 'll no longer be wasting money on professional-looking duds and carting yourself to and from the office . Best of all , you wo n't be saving for retirement anymore . Even with increased health-care costs , who needs the extra money ? You might . That retirement calculation is not a magic number . According to the latest retirement study from McKinsey , well over half of retirees with more than $1 million in assets were spending 100% or more of what they spent while they were working . " Free time is an expensive proposition , especially for the affluent , " says Joanna Rotenberg , the consultant who headed up the study . Complicating the spending picture is the transition from traditional pensions , which acted as a de facto budget , to defined-contribution plans , which require the retiree to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a wad of cash to tap , " says Alicia Munnell at Boston College 's Center for Retirement Research . " With the 401(k) , people have to face the challenge of how to use that money over the rest of their life . " Travel is usually high on the list . According to the study , 65% of affluent retirees are setting off to see the world . And when it comes to those leisure pursuits , 55% did n't expect them to cost as much as they did . Even day-to-day expenses can take well-to-do retirees by surprise  --  half are paying more for things like utilities , property taxes , and groceries than they anticipated . And children , no matter what age , can be costly  --  10% of retirees have kids who are still living off Mom and Dad . So the rule of thumb is not retirement gospel . " Think about the full cost of what you want to do , and build it into your financial plan , " says Rotenberg . That bottle of Krug you 've always wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come cheap . Neither does helping your 30-year-old with a down payment on a house . DO N'T PUT THAT BRAIN AWAY : YOU 'RE NOT DONE WORKING Of course , there is an antidote to increased spending : a job . " Unless you 're really wealthy , consider working in retirement so that you do n't have to start spending that nest egg right away , " says Dychtwald . You wo n't be alone . According to a Vanguard survey released this year , 61% of Americans between the ages of 40 and 69 indicated that retirement would include some form of labor . Dennis Wyman , a former systems engineer and trade show manager for Intel , originally planned to retire at age 62 . But last year , when the company laid off more than 10,000 employees , he had to retire three years early . Fortunately , his wife is working full-time . And he had managed to build up more than $400,000 in his 401(k) and another few hundred thousand in his IRA , so they were n't in financial straits . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the nest egg . " We need it to keep growing , " he says . He decided to work , under one condition : It had to have an element of play . An avid cyclist  --  he has twice completed the 450-mile Cycle Oregon  --  he has long enjoyed fixing bicycles . His new career : mechanic at a local bike shop . " Learning something new is exciting , " he says . So is keeping your brain stimulated . " Retirees want to stay intellectually challenged , " says Brad Lawson of YourEncore , an organization that connects highly skilled retirees with FORTUNE 500 companies who need help with short-term projects . " They want to continue to leverage their expertise . " Davey Scoon , 60 , the former CFO of Tom 's of Maine , teaches managerial accounting each fall at Tufts School of Medicine and chairs the audit committee of two publicly traded companies . " If I did n't have a reason to stay up on financial accounting , I would n't be happy , " he says . " Being with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR POST-BIG-SHOT IDENTITY A little work staves off money shortages and boredom ; it can also prevent identity crises . " In this culture , you are what you do , " says Jon Duncan , a Seattle-based financial and retirement planner . " That paycheck is a weekly reminder of your value . " Not surprisingly , the more all-consuming the career , the more difficult for the retiree to adjust . " They need that daily validation from the working world around them , " says Lauren Mackler , a personal and professional coach . Case in point : Ajit Kapoor , 63 , of Orlando , who spent the past 30 years climbing his way up the corporate ladder at companies like Xerox , AlliedSignal , General Motors , and finally Lockheed Martin . His wife , Sarah , had long been telling him that he needed to find an identity outside work . He paid no heed  --  until the pool party at his neighbor 's house last November , a month after he retired as chief technology architect . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big shot at Lockheed . " " Actually I 'm not , " Kapoor replied . " I just retired . " The remark and his own response threw Kapoor for a loop . " My whole life I was Ajit Kapoor , VP of something , " he says . " Suddenly people were like , " Who are you ? " And I had to think about it . " So he took up some hobbies , like golf and cooking . He visited his children in Boston and Phoenix . He read novels . Time helped heal the identity wound . " Gradually you find that you are n't suddenly nobody , " he says . Still , he has n't completely found a sense of self outside work . He recently started a business named ( tellingly ) Kapoor Group that consults with small companies in India . Making new connections is also important in discovering your worth outside work . One of the great nonmonetary benefits of a full-time job is the wellspring of friendships you develop with people who have a pretty good understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us take for granted . According to a 2006 study by Ameriprise Financial , Age Wave , and Harris Interactive , losing those social connections is the most unforeseen difficulty of retirement . Just 13% of preretirees say it will be the hardest aspect to deal with , but once out the door , 22% report this loss as the greatest adversity during the transition . YOU AND THE SPOUSE WILL BE SPENDING A LOT  --  A LOT  --  OF TIME TOGETHER Laura Mendelsohn , 59 , had been warned by friends to expect some tension with her husband after she retired in 2003 as a research scientist for Eli Lilly . Married 26 years to Alan , age 57 , she thought they had worked out all the usual marital kinks along the way . " We got along so well , " she says . " What could we possibly have conflict with ? " For starters , having less time and space to herself . If he is watching television , and she wants to practice her violin , she schleps her stuff upstairs so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on part-time medical writing assignments , he has a hard time with her shutting the door in order to concentrate . " He 's around more than I expected , " she says . " If I want to read a book or work on learning Italian , I have to hide . It 's great that he wants to be with me , but sometimes I 'm busy conjugating verbs . " With all of that togetherness , which you may or may not have been longing for , unexpected issues can arise in even the best of partnerships . " People do n't anticipate the problems around this transition , " says Phyllis Moen , a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied the effects of retirement on marriage . " Couples need to renegotiate their time together and their routines , just as they did early in their marriage . " Her research finds that newly retired couples report the highest levels of marital conflict . The good news is that after two years that tension tends to diminish . Developing common interests keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , so trotting the globe was a big priority . At least once or twice a year the Indianapolis couple takes some far-flung trip  --  a week in Provence , a drive along the Amalfi coast . But just as important is having time apart . Alan wants to see more of the world than Laura does . So last year he toured Asia without her . Laura joined a book group and takes acrylic-painting classes . " I 'm more solitary , and he 's very gregarious , " she says . Which is fine , says Moen : " Marriages do better when spouses have time to do their own thing . " Recalibrating your marriage takes a little practice and a little getting used to , just like everything else about your post-corporate life . If bliss were a simple matter of golf , sailboats , and watching Law &; Order marathons , this stuff would be easy . Alas , no . Retirement is a lot of work , so get cracking .
