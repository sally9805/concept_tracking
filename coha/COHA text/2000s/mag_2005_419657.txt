MLB The Red Sox and Yankees take center stage this weekend in an opening act that kicks off what should be a monthlong race for the A.L . East crown By Stan McNeal Photograph You get what you need when yon apply Mick 's music to Sox-Yanks. // When the Rolling Stones opened their latest tour at Fenway Park , they proved to have plenty in common with the resident left fielder . Like Manny Ramirez , the Stones belt out hits nightly , Like Manny , the Stones sometimes act as though they 've lost a few brain cells . And like Manny , the Stones can cause considerable damage in the outfield ; tons of sod had to be hauled in after their shows left the Fenway grass as pockmarked as Keith Richards ' mug . Though the ageless rockers thrilled Boston in their two-night run , their shows featured no more excitement than what can be expected when the super groups of MLB get together , which will happen again this weekend at Yankee Stadium . Because of pitching breakdowns , the Yankees and Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the past two years . But one of these teams still figures to win the American League East . If recent history holds up-their rivalry is squared at 42 wins apiece since the beginning of 2002 , including the postseason-the race wo n't end until a season-ending series back at Fenway . Devil Rays manager Lou Piniella , who has been running around ballfields as long as 62-year-old Mick Jagger has been strutting on stages , has seen as much of the Sox and Yankees as any opponent , and he does n't know who rates the edge . " I think it 's going to come down to the face-to-face meetings , " Piniella says . " Both teams are good teams . ( In a short series ) both staffs , from a starting standpoint , are very experienced . Really , that bodes well for both teams . " So does this : Both are loaded with stars , much like the Sox 's clubhouse on the nights it was taken over by Mick and his boys . Then there 's also this connection between hardball and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stones , there 's a song or CD out there to define every key story line in this latest clash pitting Derek and the Dynamos against Green ( Monster ) Day . Start Me Up For the Stones : A party song that the Stones sold ( out ) to various commercial endeavors . It also has become an arena favorite . For Sox-Yanks : Curt Schilling would rather be starting than closing . This much is obvious : If Schilling does n't return to form , a return to the World Series for the Sox is about as likely as a Stones retirement . This , too , is obvious : A return to form is no certainty . Schilling said he was as discouraged as he has been in a long time after he was banged around by the Devil Rays for four runs in the second inning of his second start since returning to the rotation . The problems : hanging splitters and a lack of command . But he followed that start with four scoreless innings in which his fastball reached 95 and he made it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Schilling 's tender ankle stays stable , he should get stronger . He wo n't be all the way back for his scheduled start against the Yankees this weekend , but by the end of the month , watch out .

" Mother 's Little Helper " might be a more applicable tune for Giambi 's resurgence but not for the reason the cynics might believe . After a strong July , Giambi stumbled through August until a cortisone shot in his left elbow calmed his tendinitis . He responded with back-to-back two-homer games , which included a 432-foot shot in Seattle that looked as though it was going to knock a hole in the window of the Hit It Here Cafe in right field . Giambi has run hot and cold all season-14 of his 26 homers have come in just seven games-but considering the Yankees wanted to send him to the minors in May , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the club 's most pleasant surprises . Giambi still needs to provide more bang against the Red Sox ( three RBIs in 11 games ) and with men on base . Seventeen of his homers have been solo shots ; by comparison , nine of Gary Sheffield 's 28 homers have come with the bases empty . Photograph Giambi // Beast of Burden For the Stones : A late- ' ' 70s hit about relationships . Like many Stones songs , this one has been interpreted many ways . For Sox-Yanks : A way to describe the pressure on Boston closer Keith Foulke this month . The Sox had one of the best bullpens last season , but this year its ERA is the worst in the A.L. , in no small part because of Foulke 's struggles . He blew four save chances and his ERA ballooned to 6.23 before he underwent knee surgery in early July . He was n't exactly thrilled with his rehab outings- " Maybe I 'm just getting old , " he told reporters while lamenting the lack of velocity on his fastball-but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in the Sox 's postseason chances . When Foulke is back to handle the ninth inning , Mike Timlin can return to his setup role . After discarding the likes of John Halama , Alan Embree ( now with the Yankees ) and Mike Remlinger , Boston entered September with Mike Myers as its only lefthander in the bullpen . At least Myers has been as reliable as any of the club 's relievers . There also is rookie righthander Jonathan Papelbon , who has pitched well and could emerge with a significant bullpen role-if he is n't needed in the rotation . But Foulke remains the key . If he performs , the Sox 's bullpen will be much better than the numbers show . Photograph Foulke // Mixed Emotions For the Stones : A Jagger song that spoke of his relationship with Richards in the late ' ' 80s . For Sox-Yanks : The feelings Red Sox Nation has for shortstop Edgar Renteria . After a slow start , Renteria has his batting average and on-base percentage in line with his career marks . At his price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize shortstop from last offseason would bring more than a .288 average and .348 OBP . Defensively , he has been mediocre . A scout wonders whether Renteria has gained weight , which could explain why his range seems to have diminished . In a three-team version of musical shortstops played last winter , Renteria went from the Cardinals to the Red Sox , Orlando Cabrera from the Sox to the Angels and David Eckstein from the Angels to the Cardinals . Considering Eckstein 's salary is less than half of either Renteria 's or Cabrera 's , he has supplied the most game for the green . Though he hit a slow stretch during St. Louis ' steamy summer , Eckstein leads National League shortstops in on-base percentage . He also has been better than advertised defensively , especially with his throwing . He has twice as many errors ( 12 ) as he did last season but has been a key reason the Cardinals rank in the top three in turning double plays . Cabrera remains the best of the three defensively , but he has struggled on offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitches , Cabrera has a .310 OBP . Photograph Renteria // Sox fans should know Renteria has excelled when it counts most-against the Yankees , against whom he 's hitting a team-high .404 with 13 RBIs in 13 games . You Ca n't Always Get What You Want For the Stones : A late- ' ' 60s hit about always longing for more , no matter what you have . For Sox-Yanks : The best way to assess the state of the Yankees ' rotation . After trotting out a major league-high 14 starters , the Yankees ' rotation seems to be set , at least as set as it has been since April ( names in bold are the rotation survivors ) .

For Sox-Yanks : What both teams have known since their pitching problems surfaced early in the season . It pays to have the most productive offenses in baseball . Just like last year , the Red Sox and Yankees rank 1-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stats : runs scored and on-base percentage . // Photograph Wells // Street Fighting Man For the Stones : A song about civil unrest in Europe and America in the late ' ' 60s . For Sox-Yanks : What Bud Selig considers David Wells . No one should blame the commish for holding a grudge against Wells . All the bombastic Boomer has done is call Selig an idiot and a liar , and that was before Wells really went off . Well , Sox fans should not be too disappointed that Selig upheld Wells ' most recent suspension . It means Wells will start against the Yankees this weekend ; otherwise , his turn would not have come up . Since Wells was rocked on opening day in Yankee Stadium , he has beaten the Yankees twice , holding them to three runs in 15 1/3 innings .
