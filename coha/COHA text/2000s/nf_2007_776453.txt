Introduction Anne Dodge had lost count of all the doctors she had seen over the past fifteen years . She guessed it was close to thirty . Now , two days after Christmas 2004 , on a surprisingly mild morning , she was driving again into Boston to see yet another physician . Her primary care doctor had opposed the trip , arguing that Anne 's problems were so long-standing and so well defined that this consultation would be useless . But her boyfriend had stubbornly insisted . Anne told herself the visit would mollify her boyfriend and she would be back home by midday . // Anne is in her thirties , with sandy brown hair and soft blue eyes . She grew up in a small town in Massachusetts , one of four sisters . No one had had an illness like hers . Around age twenty , she found that food did not agree with her . After a meal , she would feel as if a hand were gripping her stomach and twisting it . The nausea and pain were so intense that occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing wrong . He gave her antacids . But the symptoms continued . Anne lost her appetite and had to force herself to eat ; then she 'd feel sick and quietly retreat to the bathroom to regurgitate . Her general practitioner suspected what was wrong , but to be sure he referred her to a psychiatrist , and the diagnosis was made : anorexia nervosa with bulimia , a disorder marked by vomiting and an aversion to food . If the condition was not corrected , she could starve to death . // Over the years , Anne had seen many internists for her primary care before settling on her current one , a woman whose practice was devoted to patients with eating disorders . Anne was also evaluated by numerous specialists : endocrinologists , orthopedists , hematologists , infectious disease doctors , and , of course , psychologists and psychiatrists . She had been treated with four different antidepressants and had undergone weekly talk therapy . Nutritionists closely monitored her daily caloric intake . // But Anne 's health continued to deteriorate , and the past twelve months had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood cell count and platelets had dropped to perilous levels . A bone marrow biopsy showed very few developing cells . The two hematologists Anne had consulted attributed the low blood counts to her nutritional deficiency . Anne also had severe osteoporosis . One endocrinologist said her bones were like those of a woman in her eighties , from a lack of vitamin D and calcium . An orthopedist diagnosed a hairline fracture of the metatarsal bone of her foot . There were also signs that her immune system was failing ; she suffered a series of infections , including meningitis . She was hospitalized four times in 2004 in a mental health facility so she could try to gain weight under supervision . // To restore her system , her internist had told Anne to consume three thousand calories a day , mostly in easily digested carbohydrates like cereals and pasta . But the more Anne ate , the worse she felt . Not only was she seized by intense nausea and the urge to vomit , but recently she had severe intestinal cramps and diarrhea . Her doctor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with psychological stress . By December , Anne 's weight dropped to eighty-two pounds . Although she said she was forcing down close to three thousand calories , her internist and her psychiatrist took the steady loss of weight as a sure sign that Anne was not telling the truth . // That day Anne was seeing Dr. Myron Falchuk , a gastroenterologist . Falchuk had already gotten her medical records , and her internist had told him that Anne 's irritable bowel syndrome was yet another manifestation of her deteriorating mental health . Falchuk heard in the doctor 's recitation of the case the implicit message that his role was to examine Anne 's abdomen , which had been poked and prodded many times by many physicians , and to reassure her that irritable bowel syndrome , while uncomfortable and annoying , should be treated as the internist had recommended , with an appropriate diet and tranquilizers. // But that is exactly what Falchuk did not do . Instead , he began to question , and listen , and observe , and then to think differently about Anne 's case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because for fifteen years a key aspect of her illness had been missed . // This book is about what goes on in a doctor 's mind as he or she treats a patient . The idea for it came to me unexpectedly , on a September morning three years ago while I was on rounds with a group of interns , residents , and medical students . I was the attending physician on " general medicine , " meaning that it was my responsibility to guide this team of trainees in its care of patients with a wide variety of clinical problems , not just those in my own specialties of blood diseases , cancer , and AIDS . There were patients on our ward with pneumonia , diabetes , and other common ailments , but there were also some with symptoms that did not readily suggest a diagnosis , or with maladies for which there was a range of possible treatments , where no one therapy was clearly superior to the others . // I like to conduct rounds in a traditional way . One member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we move as a group to the bedside , where we talk to the patient and examine him . The team then returns to the conference room to discuss the problem . I follow a Socratic method in the discussion , encouraging the students and residents to challenge each other , and challenge me , with their ideas . But at the end of rounds on that September morning I found myself feeling disturbed . I was concerned about the lack of give-and-take among the trainees , but even more I was disappointed with myself as their teacher . I concluded that these very bright and very affable medical students , interns , and residents all too often failed to question cogently or listen carefully or observe keenly . They were not thinking deeply about their patients ' problems . Something was profoundly wrong with the way they were learning to solve clinical puzzles and care for people . // You hear this kind of criticism - that each new generation of young doctors is not as insightful or competent as its forebears - regularly among older physicians , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years ago , there was real rigor and we had to know our stuff . Nowadays , well ... " These wistful , aging doctors speak as if some magic that had transformed them into consummate clinicians has disappeared . I suspect each older generation carries with it the notion that its time and place , seen through the distorting lens of nostalgia , were superior to those of today . Until recently , I confess , I shared that nostalgic sensibility . But on reflection I saw that there also were major flaws in my own medical training . What distinguished my learning from the learning of my young trainees was the nature of the deficiency , the type of flaw . // My generation was never explicitly taught how to think as clinicians . We learned medicine catch-as-catch-can . Trainees observed senior physicians the way apprentices observed master craftsmen in a medieval guild , and somehow the novices were supposed to assimilate their elders ' approach to diagnosis and treatment . Rarely did an attending physician actually explain the mental steps that led him to his decisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp reaction against this catch- as-catch-can approach . To establish a more organized structure , medical students and residents are being taught to follow preset algorithms and practice guidelines in the form of decision trees . This method is also being touted by certain administrators to senior staff in many hospitals in the United States and Europe . Insurance companies have found it particularly attractive in deciding whether to approve the use of certain diagnostic tests or treatments . // The trunk of the clinical decision tree is a patient 's major symptom or laboratory result , contained within a box . Arrows branch from the first box to other boxes . For example , a common symptom like " sore throat " would begin the algorithm , followed by a series of branches with " yes " or " no " questions about associated symptoms . Is there a fever or not ? Are swollen lymph nodes associated with the sore throat ? Have other family members suffered from this symptom ? Similarly , a laboratory test like a throat culture for bacteria would appear farther down the trunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " no " answers to the results of the culture . Ultimately , following the branches to the end should lead to the correct diagnosis and therapy . // Clinical algorithms can be useful for run-of-the-mill diagnosis and treatment - distinguishing strep throat from viral pharyngitis , for example . But they quickly fall apart when a doctor needs to think outside their boxes , when symptoms are vague , or multiple and confusing , or when test results are inexact . In such cases - the kinds of cases where we most need a discerning doctor - algorithms discourage physicians from thinking independently and creatively . Instead of expanding a doctor 's thinking , they can constrain it . // Similarly , a movement is afoot to base all treatment decisions strictly on statistically proven data . This so-called evidence-based medicine is rapidly becoming the canon in many hospitals . Treatments outside the statistically proven are considered taboo until a sufficient body of data can be generated from clinical trials . Of course , every doctor should consider research studies in choosing a therapy . But today 's rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passively , solely by the numbers . // Statistics can not substitute for the human being before you ; statistics embody averages , not individuals . Numbers can only complement a physician 's personal experience with a drug or a procedure , as well as his knowledge of whether a " best " therapy from a clinical trial fits a patient 's particular needs and values . // Each morning as rounds began , I watched the students and residents eye their algorithms and then invoke statistics from recent studies . I concluded that the next generation of doctors was being conditioned to function like a well-programmed computer that operates within a strict binary framework . After several weeks of unease about the students ' and residents ' reliance on algorithms and evidence-based therapies alone , and my equally unsettling sense that I did n't know how to broaden their perspective and show them otherwise , I asked myself a simple question : How should a doctor think ? // This question , not surprisingly , spawned others : Do different doctors think differently ? Are different forms of thinking more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , do surgeons think differently from internists , who think differently from pediatricians ? Is there one " best " way to think , or are there multiple , alternative styles that can reach a correct diagnosis and choose the most effective treatment ? How does a doctor think when he is forced to improvise , when confronted with a problem for which there is little or no precedent ? ( Here algorithms are essentially irrelevant and statistical evidence is absent . ) How does a doctor 's thinking differ during routine visits versus times of clinical crisis ? Do a doctor 's emotions - his like or dislike of a particular patient , his attitudes about the social and psychological makeup of his patient 's life - color his thinking ? Why do even the most accomplished physicians miss a key clue about a person 's true diagnosis , or detour far afield from the right remedy ? In sum , when and why does thinking go right or go wrong in medicine ? // I had no ready answers to these questions , despite having trained in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical medicine for some thirty years . So I began to ask my colleagues for answers . Nearly all of the practicing physicians I queried were intrigued by the questions but confessed that they had never really thought about how they think . Then I searched the medical literature for studies of clinical thinking . I found a wealth of research that modeled " optimal " medical decision-making with complex mathematical formulas , but even the advocates of such formulas conceded that they rarely mirrored reality at the bedside or could be followed practically . I saw why I found it difficult to teach the trainees on rounds how to think . I also saw that I was not serving my own patients as well as I might . I felt that if I became more aware of my own way of thinking , particularly its pitfalls , I would be a better caregiver . I was n't one of the hematologists who evaluated Anne Dodge , but I could well have been , and I feared that I too could have failed to recognize what was missing in her diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician to be infallible . Medicine is , at its core , an uncertain science . Every doctor makes mistakes in diagnosis and treatment . But the frequency of those mistakes , and their severity , can be reduced by understanding how a doctor thinks and how he or she can think better . This book was written with that goal in mind . It is primarily intended for laymen , though I believe physicians and other medical professionals will find it useful . Why for laymen ? Because doctors desperately need patients and their families and friends to help them think . Without their help , physicians are denied key clues to what is really wrong . I learned this not as a doctor but when I was sick , when I was the patient . // We 've all wondered why a doctor asked certain questions , or detoured into unexpected areas when gathering information about us . We have all asked ourselves exactly what brought him to propose a certain diagnosis and a particular treatment and to reject the alternatives . Although we may listen intently to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often we are left perplexed about what is really going on in his head . That ignorance inhibits us from successfully communicating with the doctor , from telling him all that he needs to hear to come to the correct diagnosis and advice on the best therapy . // In Anne Dodge 's case , after a myriad of tests and procedures , it was her words that led Falchuk to correctly diagnose her illness and save her life . While modern medicine is aided by a dazzling array of technologies , like high-resolution MRI scans and pinpoint DNA analysis , language is still the bedrock of clinical practice . We tell the doctor what is bothering us , what we feel is different , and then respond to his questions . This dialogue is our first clue to how our doctor thinks , so the book begins there , exploring what we learn about a physician 's mind from what he says and how he says it . But it is not only clinical logic that patients can extract from their dialogue with a doctor . They can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor who assesses our emotional state . But few of us realize how strongly a physician 's mood and temperament influence his medical judgment . We , of course , may get only glimpses of our doctor 's feelings , but even those brief moments can reveal a great deal about why he chose to pursue a possible diagnosis or offered a particular treatment . // After surveying the significance of a doctor 's words and feelings , the book follows the path that we take when we move through today 's medical system . If we have an urgent problem , we rush to the emergency room . There , doctors often do not have the benefit of knowing us , and must work with limited information about our medical history . I examine how doctors think under these conditions , how keen judgments and serious cognitive errors are made under the time pressures of the ER . If our clinical problem is not an emergency , then our path begins with our primary care physician - if a child , a pediatrician ; if an adult , an internist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are termed " gatekeepers , " because they open the portals to specialists . The narrative continues through these portals ; at each step along the way , we see how essential it is for even the most astute doctor to doubt his thinking , to repeatedly factor into his analysis the possibility that he is wrong . We also encounter the tension between his acknowledging uncertainty and the need to take a clinical leap and act . One chapter reports on this in my own case ; I sought help from six renowned hand surgeons for an incapacitating problem and got four different opinions . //
