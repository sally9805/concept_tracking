I go commando Jessica Biel ( above ) // GRANDPARENTS ' DAY SPECIAL ! // WHO 'S HE ? Forty-niner Vernon Davis , last year 's No. 6 draft pick who got what was then the largest contract ( $23 million , five years ) ever for a tight end . He grew up the eldest of seven siblings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHE ? Adaline Davis , Vernon 's grandmother , who raised the entire brood herself . // WHY NOW ? This Sunday  --  in case you needed another reason to buy a greeting card  --  is the 30th annual Grandparents Day . // ADALINE 'S RULES Just two : 1 . Do n't accept anything that comes easy , and 2 . Treat everyone with respect . That means everyone . At 15 Vernon , a star athlete at Dunbar High , told Adaline he was ditching his close friends , who were getting into drugs . She said to detach with love . " I told him they could turn their lives around , become lawyers or doctors and that he might need them one day , " Adaline recalls . " So to let them know you love them and you 'll be there for them but you have to do your own thing right now . " // WRONG MOVE At Maryland , Vernon gave himself a reminder of the woman he calls " Ma " by tattooing Adaline on his arm . " When he showed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out the door , turned the lock , shut the lights and did n't sleep a wink that night . " After church the next day Adaline called to forgive him . And after last year 's draft , he got another tattoo  --  of her image on his chest . // GIVING BACK Davis , who describes Adaline as " my best friend , " bought a five-bedroom house for her and his siblings in Silver Spring , Md . He has also pledged a yearly $10,000 donation to her church , Newborn Pentecostal , in D.C. // THE LAST WORD Adaline 's proud of Vernon , but she wo n't come see him play ; she 's too worried he 'll get injured . She records his games , then watches after getting a postgame call from Vernon saying he 's O.K. " I do n't like his tattoos , I do n't like his football and I do n't like his dreads either , " says Adaline . " But with all my heart and soul I love him dearly .
