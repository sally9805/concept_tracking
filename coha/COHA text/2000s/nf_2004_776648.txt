Democracy Before America // It is often said that America " invented " democracy . This view is , of course , an understatement ; America invented not only democracy , but freedom , justice , liberty , and " time-sharing . " But representative democracy is unquestionably our proudest achievement , the creation most uniquely our own , even if the rest of the Western world would have come up with the idea themselves by the 1820s . So why , then , has participation in this most wondrous system withered ? // As heirs to a legacy more than two centuries old , it is understandable why present-day Americans would take their own democracy for granted . A president freely chosen from a wide-open field of two men every four years ; a Congress with a 99% incumbency rate ; a Supreme Court comprised of nine politically appointed judges whose only oversight is the icy scythe of Death- all these reveal a system fully capable of maintaining itself . But our perfect democracy , which neither needs nor particularly wants voters , is a rarity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of government in the world today , and that dozens of foreign countries still long for a democracy such as ours to be imposed on them . // To regain our sense of perspective and wonder , we must take a broader historical view , looking beyond America 's relatively recent success story to examine our predecessors and their adorable failures . In this chapter , we will briefly explore the evolution of an idea , following the H.M.S. Democracy on her dangerous voyage through the mists of time , past the Straits of Monarchy , surviving Hurricane Theocracy , then navigating around the Cape of Good Feudal System to arrive , battered but safe , at her destined port-of-call : Americatown. // Early Man : More Animal Than Political // The human race is by nature brutal , amoral , unreasonable and self-centered , but for the first few hundred thousand years of our existence as a species , we were way too obvious about it . Primitive culture centered on survival of the individual and , occasionally , survival of someone the individual might want to reproduce with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were non-existent , as was debate , which would appear later after the invention of the frontal lobe . For prehistoric man the rule of law , such as it was , could best be summed up by the seminal case Marbury 's Head v. Madison 's Rock . // Early man lived this tenuous Darwinian nightmare for an age or two , until a peculiar thing happened : The unfittest decided they would n't mind surviving either . The feeble and weak realized that without a good plan they were n't were mammoth meat . Together , they would become a force with a chance to see the day when their children 's children would be only 75% covered in hair . From these noble impulses , the groundwork for the first civilizations was laid . // Athens : Our Big Fat Greek Forerunners // Ancient Greece is widely credited with creating the world 's first democracy . It would be a worthy endeavor to travel back in time to the feta-strewn shores of fifth-century B.C. Athens and ask Plato to define democracy , and not only to make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , would already know . Plato would tell us , in that affectionate but non-sexual way of his , that " democracy " is a Greek word combining the roots for " people " ( " demos- " ) and " rule " ( " - kratia " ) . In Greek democracy , political power was concentrated not in the hands of one person , or even a small group of people , but rather evenly and fairly distributed among all the people , meaning every John Q. Publikopolous could play a role in Athenian government . The main legislative body , the Assembly , was comprised of no less than the first 6,000 citizens to arrive at its meetings-and bear in mind , no saving seats . Jury duty was considered an honor to be vied for . Membership in most other civic institutions , including the Supreme Court , was chosen ... by lot ! Imagine a system in which anyone could wind up serving on the Supreme Court . Anyone . Think about your own family . Friends . The guys you knew in college who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them as your randomly chosen Chief Justice , and you 'll appreciate just how fucked-up this system was . // Compared with American democracy , the Athenian version seems simplistic , naive , and gay . Transcripts of early Athenian policy debates reveal a populace moved more by eloquence and rationality than demagogues and fear-mongering . Thankfully , this type of humane governance was n't allowed to take root . Athens 's great experiment ended after less than two centuries , when , in 338 B.C. , Philip of Macedon 's forces invaded the city , inflicting on its inhabitants the eternal fate of the noble and enlightened : to be brutally crushed by the armed and dumb . // Rome : The First Republicans // The fall of Athens was followed by the emergence , overnight , of Rome . At first glance its people appear to have enjoyed a system of representative government similar to ours . True , behind its fa ? ade of allegedly " representative " officials lurked a de facto oligarchy ruled by entrenched plutocrats . But the similarities do n't end there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas from the Roman model , including its bicameral legislature , its emphasis on republicanism and civic virtue , and its Freudian fascination with big white columns . // However , there was very little real democracy in Rome . While the Senate theoretically represented the people , in reality its wealthy members covertly pursued pro-business legislation on behalf of such military-industrial giants as JavelinCorp , United Crucifix , and a cartel of resource-exploiting companies known as Big Aqueduct . They even monopolized the most notorious aspect of Roman life , instituting an orgy policy that can literally be described as " trickle-down. " // Vomitoriums aside , Rome 's biggest contribution to American government was probably its legal system , which codified key concepts like equal protection , " innocent until proven guilty , " and the right to confront one 's accusers . These very same issues would later form the basis of both the Bill of Rights and a mind-numbing quantity of Law and Order scripts . But by the time of Rome 's huge millennium celebration marking the beginning of O A.D. , the faint light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given way to Empire . The only voting to speak of took place in the Colosseum and was generally limited to a handful of disembowelment-related issues . In time , the Empire itself fell , as history teaches us all empires inevitably must . Its most enduring legacy : a numerical system that allowed future generations to more easily keep track of Super Bowls . // The Magna Carta : Power to the Extremely Wealthy People // And then , darkness . For more than 1,000 years democracy disappeared from the European scene . The period instead saw the blossoming of an exciting array of alternate forms of government , such as monarchy , absolute monarchy , kingship , queenhood , and three different types of oppression ( religious/ethnic/ " for shits and giggles " ) . As for individual liberty , " innocent until proven guilty " was rapidly supplanted by a more aggressive law-and-order approach better characterized as " guilty until proven flammable . " // Democracy had disappeared . The people needed a champion , and as is usually the case , the obscenely rich rode to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give King John the money he needed to wage war unless he signed the Magna Carta . The document codified that no man was above the law . Unfortunately for the peasant class , it did little to address how many were below it . Startlingly ahead of its time , this extraordinary document had a profound effect on people and continues to shape twenty-first-century views on topics as diverse as escheat , socage , burage , novel disseisin , and the bailiwicks of Gerard of Athee . But even more importantly , the Magna Carta set a powerful precedent for our own Founding Fathers : There was no more powerful means of safeguarding individual liberty than a vaguely worded manifesto inked in inscrutable cursive on dilapidated parchment. // The Magna Carta served as a wake-up call that Europe would be forced to answer-in about five hundred years . For Lady Democracy , having lain dormant for more than a millennium , had risen from its slumber only to stretch its arms , reach for the clock , and groggily set the snooze bar for " The Enlightenment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though a promising development for democracy , the Magna Carta was mostly ignored as the world plunged into what would be known as the Dark Ages . It was an apt title for an era when amoebic dysentery was considered the good kind of dysentery . Oppression and high mortality rates seemed ready to swallow what remained of mankind , when through the darkness emerged the light that would be its salvation : Reason . It began slowly . " Hey , what if we stop storing the corpses in the drinking water and see if that makes any difference to our health ? " From there , it gathered momentum . Soon , all conventional wisdom , from the shape of the Earth to whether the ruling class could have your hut burned and your organs removed because they thought you caused an eclipse , was up for grabs . This last question proved especially pertinent for the future of democracy and ushered in an era known as the Enlightenment . // The Enlightenment , with its emphasis on reason , would finally provide democracy with its philosophical underpinnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkers espousing political systems based on what they called " the social contract . " Government , they theorized , was a sort of legal agreement between the rulers and the ruled , the terms of which were binding on both parties . It was a groundbreaking theory . All they needed now was some country dumb enough to try it before the King found out and had them all drawn and quartered . // Democracy needed a fresh start-hearty and idealistic champions who would strike out for a new world , willing to risk everything for the principles of equality , liberty , justice ... and slaves . We 'd need some slaves and guns . But we 're getting ahead of ourselves . A new world awaited . //
