The first indication he got that his carefully laid plans for the night were doomed came when he opened his bedchamber door and found Cleopatra standing in the hallway . " Bloody hell , " he said very softly . " I was expecting Minerva . " His long-anticipated vision of a night of passion spent in a comfortable bed with his lover and occasional business partner , Lavinia Lake , faded into a hazy mist . His past had come back to haunt him at a most inconvenient moment . " Hello , Tobias . " The woman in the hall lowered the green and gilt mask attached to the little gold post in her hand . The cobra diadem that graced her long , elaborately braided black wig gleamed in the light of a nearby wall sconce . Wry amusement lit her dark eyes . " It has been a long time , has it not ? May I come in ? " It had , in fact , been three years since he had last seen Aspasia Gray , but she had changed very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical profile that was well-suited to her guise as the queen of Egypt . He knew that her real hair was a deep , rich brown . Her tall , elegantly proportioned figure was displayed to advantage in a pale green gown trimmed with gold embroidery . The last thing he wanted to do tonight was renew old acquaintances , Tobias March thought . But the sight of Aspasia Gray had definitely shattered the mood . Memories from that very dark time three years ago crashed over him with the force of storm-driven waves . He collected his wits with an effort and quickly surveyed the darkened hallway behind Aspasia . There was no sign of Lavinia . Maybe , if he acted swiftly , he would be able to rid himself of hisunwelcome visitor before his evening was entirely ruined . " I suppose you 'd better come in . " Reluctantly , he stepped back . " You have not changed , sir , " she murmured . " Still as gracious as ever , I see . " She entered the firelit room with a soft rustle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door and turned to face her . He had not noticed any Cleopatras at the costume ball earlier in the evening , but that was not surprising . Beaumont Castle was a huge , sprawling monstrosity of a house , and tonight it was crammed with people . He had been interested in only one particular guest . The invitation to the house party had come through the auspices of Lord Vale . Tobias 's first , automatic inclination had been to decline the offer . He had little interest in such affairs . House parties , in particular , struck him as tedious at best , albeit his experience of them was limited . But then Vale had reminded him of the one singular attraction of a properly organized country-house party . Yes , there are the lengthy , boring breakfasts and the frivolous conversations and the silly games , but bear in mind this vastly important , highly relevant point : you and Mrs. Lake will each be provided with a private bedchamber . Furthermore , no one will pay the least attention to which of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true objective of a well-planned house party is to provide ample opportunities of that sort . The reminder of the true nature of a large house party had struck Tobias with the force of a lightning bolt . When Vale , who had no intention of attending the Beaumont affair , graciously offered the use of one of his private carriages for the journey , Tobias had felt himself inspired . He had been surprised , not to say greatly relieved , when Lavinia agreed to the plan with very little fuss . He suspected that her enthusiasm was generated in large part because she viewed the house party as an excellent opportunity to fish for new business . But he refused to allow that fact to depress his spirits . For the first time in their acquaintance , they would enjoy the luxury of being able to spend the better portion of not one but two entire nights in the cozy warmth and privacy of a real bed . The prospect had been dazzling . For once there would be no need to sneak about in remote sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's little study . For three glorious days he would not be obliged to rely on the benevolent graces of Lavinia 's housekeeper , who could sometimes be persuaded to take herself off to shop for currants when he came to call . He certainly savored the all-too-brief encounters alone with Lavinia in town , but those occasionsstimulating though they weretended to be rushed and occasionally nerve-racking . The weather had a nasty habit of delivering rain on afternoons when he chose the park for a tryst , and one never knew when Lavinia 's niece , Emeline , might select an inopportune moment to return home . There was also the unpredictable nature of the business in which he and Lavinia were engaged . When one offered one 's services to persons who wished to commission private inquiries and investigations , one never knew when a client might knock on the door . He looked at Aspasia . " What the devil are you doing here ? I thought you were in Paris . " " I am well aware that you have a tendency to be blunt to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I deserve a warmer welcome from you . It is not as though I am only a casual acquaintance , after all . " She was right , he thought . The two of them were forever linked by the events of the past and by a dead man named Zachary Elland . " My apologies , " he said quietly , " but the truth is , you have caught me very much by surprise . I did not see you this afternoon when the other guests descended on the castle , nor did I notice you at the costume ball tonight . " " I arrived quite late , after the evening festivities had commenced . I saw you at the ball , but you were preoccupied with your little redheaded friend . " Aspasia stripped off her gloves with languid grace and held her hands out to the fire . " Who on earth is she , Tobias ? I would not have said that she was your type . " " Her name is Mrs. Lake . " He did not bother to conceal the edge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked down into the flames . " You are lovers . " It was a statement , not a question . " We are also business partners , " he said evenly . " On occasion . " Aspasia glanced at him , fine brows lifted in a faintly quizzical expression . " I do not understand . Do you refer to some financial dealings in which the two of you are engaged ? " " In a manner of speaking . Mrs. Lake and I both make our livings in the same fashion . She takes commissions for private inquiries , just as I do . We investigate certain cases together . " She smiled fleetingly . " I suppose the private-inquiry business is a step up from being a spy , but surely it is not nearly as respectable as your previous career as a man of business . " " I find it suits my temperament . " " I will not ask how your partner made her living before she went into this odd profession . " Enough was enough , he thought . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aspasia , tell me why you are here . I have plans for the remainder of the night . " " Plans that no doubt include Mrs. Lake . " Aspasia sounded genuinely apologetic . " I truly am sorry , Tobias . Please believe me when I tell you that I would not have come to your bedchamber at this hour had it not been extremely urgent . " " Can this matter wait until morning ? " " I 'm afraid not . " She turned away from the fire and walked slowly toward him . Aspasia was a woman of the world . He knew that she was well-schooled in the fine social art of concealing her private sentiments and feelings . But now he glimpsed a disturbing shift in the shadows beneath her cool veneer . He had seen that same emotion often enough in others to recognize it instantly . Aspasia Gray was afraid . " What is wrong ? " he asked , somewhat more gently this time . She sighed . " I did not come here to spend a few days rusticating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intention whatsoever of accepting the invitation to Beaumont 's house party . Indeed , I sent my regrets some weeks ago . But things changed . I am here now because I followed you , sir . " He glanced at his pocket watch lying on the dressing table and saw that it was nearly one o'clock in the morning . The house had settled down for the night . In a few minutes Lavinia would knock on his door . He very much wanted to get rid of Aspasia before that happened . " Why the devil did you chase all this way after me ? " he asked . " It 's a six-hour drive from Town . " " I had no choice . This morning I went straight to your address in Slate Street but you had already departed . Your man informed me that you had left for Beaumont Castle and would be gone for several days . Fortunately , I remembered that the invitation mentioned the costume ball . I managed to find this wig and a mask at the last minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , curiosity stirring . " Yes , of course . " Aspasia brushed that aside . " Lady Beaumont sends invitations to everyone in Society . She delights in entertaining . It has been her passion for years , and Lord Beaumont is only too happy to indulge her . " Everyone in Society certainly did not include Lavinia or himself , he reflected . They managed to hang around on the fringes of the polite world thanks to connections with some wealthy , powerful former clients such as Vale and Mrs. Dove , but that association did not automatically qualify them to be placed on any hostess 's regular guest list . Aspasia 's pedigree , on the other hand , was impeccable . She was the last of her line , and she controlled a substantial inheritance that she had received from her father . At seventeen she had been briefly married to a man some forty years her senior . His death six months after the nuptials had left her with an additional income . Tobias calculated that she was now twenty-eight . The combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive addition to any guest list . It was not at all surprising that she had received an invitation to Beaumont Castle . " I 'm surprised the housekeeper was able to find a bedchamber for you on such short notice , " he said . " I thought the castle was filled to the rafters . " " It is quite crowded . But when I arrived and made it plain that there had been a mistake with the invitations , ' the butler and housekeeper consulted together . They managed to find a very pleasant room for me just down the hall . I suspect that they arranged to move someone of lesser consequence to a less desirable location . " " Tell me what this is about , Aspasia . " She began to pace back and forth in front of the hearth . " I 'm not sure where to start . I returned from Paris last month and took a house in Town . Naturally I had intended to call upon you in due course after I was settled . " He watched her face very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last statement . He was quite certain that , if she 'd had a choice in the matter , she would have been content to avoid him indefinitely . He understood . She would always associate him with the tragic events of three years past . " What changed your mind ? " he asked . Her expression did not alter , but her elegant bare shoulders stiffened with tension . It would , he reflected , take a great deal to rattle Aspasia 's nerves . " Something happened this morning , " she said , gazing into the fire . " Something quite unsettling . I could not think of anything else to do but to consult with you immediately , Tobias . " " I suggest you come straight to the point , " he said . " Very well , but I fear you will not credit what I have to say if I do not show you what was left on my front step early this morning . " She opened a tiny , beaded reticule and removed a small object wrapped in a linen handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . He plucked the small parcel from her fingers and carried it across the room to examine it in the light of the candle . There he untied the handkerchief and let the cloth fall away . He looked at the ring that had been revealed and felt the hair lift on the back of his neck . " Hell 's teeth , " he whispered . Aspasia said nothing . She folded her arms beneath her breasts and waited , eyes shadowed . He studied the ring more closely . The band was set with black stones . The darkly glittering gems framed a small gold coffin . He used the tip of one finger to raise the lid . A tiny , exquisitely detailed white skull grinned up at him from inside the miniature sarcophagus . He angled the ring to read the Latin inscription on the inside of the lid , translating the ancient warning silently to himself . Death comes . He met Aspasia 's eyes . " It is an old memento-mori ring . " " Yes . " She hugged herself more tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " My housekeeper found it . The ring was inside a small box covered in black velvet . " " Was there a note ? A message of some kind ? " " No . Just that damned ring . " She shuddered , no longer bothering to conceal her disquiet . " You see now why I went to such lengths to find you tonight ? " " It is impossible , " he said flatly . " Zachary Elland is dead , Aspasia . We both saw the body . " She closed her eyes briefly in pain and then looked at him very steadily . " You do not need to remind me . " The old guilt slammed through him . " Of course not . My apologies . " " Afterward , " she said slowly , " you told me you 'd heard rumors of another man who once made a profession of murder , just as Zachary had done , a killer who used the same ghastly signature . " " Calm yourself , Aspasia . " " I recall you told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never any proof of murder in the first place because the deaths always appeared accidental or natural . " " Aspasia " " Maybe he 's still out there , Tobias . Maybe " " Listen closely , " he said in a tone that finally succeeded in silencing her . " The original Memento-Mori Man , if he ever actually existed , would be quite elderly by now . Dead , most likely . Those rumors dated from decades back . Crackenburne and some of his companions heard them years ago when they themselves were young men . " " Yes , I know . " " They eventually concluded that the tale of a professional killer for hire was never anything other than just that , a grisly legend . It was fed by rumors among servants who gossiped in the taverns and told tall tales to their friends . Zachary no doubt took pleasure in invoking the old stories because it suited his sense of melodrama . You know how he thrived on excitement . " " Yes , of course . " The room was warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill . " He craved thrills and drama the way some are addicted to opium . " She hesitated . " He no doubt enjoyed re-creating the legend of the Memento-Mori Man . Now it would appear that someone else has the same taste for melodrama . " " Perhaps . " " Tobias , I do not mind telling you that I am quite frightened . " " Obviously someone else knows about Zachary Elland and his connection to you . " He contemplated the miniature skull in the gold coffin . " Are you sure there was no note ? " " I am positive . " She stared bleakly at the ring . " He left that death's- head on my step to terrify me . " " Why would he do that ? " " I do not know . " A visible shiver went through her . " I 've been thinking about that question all day . Indeed , I 've thought of little else . " She paused . " What if . . . what if whoever left that ring blames me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Zachary took his own life when he realized that I was about to have him brought up on charges of murder . You had nothing to do with his death . " " Maybe whoever left that ring does n't know that . " " Indeed . " But that conclusion did not feel right , he thought . He raised the little skull to the light again . The death's-head stared back at him with its empty eye sockets , taunting him with its macabre grin . " We must also consider the possibility that this was intended as an announcement of some sort . " " What do you mean ? " He weighed the ring in the palm of his hand . " You are one of the very small number of people who would comprehend the significance of this ring , because you are one of the few who knew that Zachary Elland styled himself the Memento-Mori Man and used such rings as his signature . I wonder if this is some new villain 's way of telling us that he plans to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be another murderer out there who seeks to emulate the Memento-Mori Man ? What a terrible thought . " She paused . " But if that were true , it would have been far more logical for him to leave his calling card with you , not me . You were the one who hunted Zachary down . " " For all I know there will be a ring waiting for me when I return to Town , " he said quietly . " I set off very early this morning . Perhaps he delivered this ring to you first , and by the time he got to my house I was gone . " She swung around and took a step toward him , anxiety clear in her eyes . " Tobias , whoever left that ring has something dreadful in mind . If you are right and this is a calling card , we are dealing with a new Memento-Mori Man . You must find him before someone is murdered . "                @ @ @ @ @
