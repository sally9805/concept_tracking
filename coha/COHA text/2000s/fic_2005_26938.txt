Chapter One A Pretty Normal Lunch My name is A.J. and I hate school . " Which do you hate more , " my friend Ryan asked me , " school or vegetables ? " " Hmmm , that 's a hard one , " I said . " I really hate them both . " " I hate school more than vegetables , " said our friend Michael , who never ties his shoes , " because we do n't have to sit inside a vegetable all day and learn stuff . " " Good point , " I agreed . " I hate vegetables more than school , " Ryan said , " because we do n't have to eat the school . " That made perfect sense too . I could n't make up my mind . We were in the vomitorium . It was a pretty normal lunch at Ella Mentry School . Ryan stuck carrot sticks in his mouth and said , " Look , I 'm a walrus ! " Michael put a spoon on his nose , and it hung there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tater Tots and eat them . Ryan will eat anything . Michael dared me to shoot a straw wrapper at Andrea Young , this girl at the next table who is really annoying . The wrapper hit Andrea in the head . She screamed and knocked her apple juice on the floor . Just at that moment , Andrea 's annoying friend Emily was walking by with her tray . Emily slipped on the juice and fell on her butt . As she was falling , she knocked over a whole rack of lunch trays . Crash ! " Ouch ! " Emily shouted . " I bumped my mouth . My tooth is loose ! " I do n't know why , but when people fall on their butt , it 's hilarious . Me and Ryan and Michael just about exploded trying not to laugh . Emily started crying . That big crybaby . She was n't even hurt , and her tooth was probably loose before she fell . Mrs. McGillicuddy , the lunch lady , came running out . " What 's going on ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. McGillicuddy is the meanest lunch lady in the history of the world . She 's always yelling at us to clean off our table , be quiet , and stop throwing food . She 's no fun at all . Mrs. McGillicuddy must not have seen the apple juice on the floor when she came running out . She slipped on it and fell on her butt too . It 's even funnier when grown-ups fall on their butts , especially mean grown-ups like Mrs. McGillicuddy . Everybody was cracking up . " You kids are driving me crazy ! " Mrs. McGillicuddy shouted . " That 's the last straw ! I quit ! " She was totally wrong . There were plenty of straws right there on the lunch counter . But Mrs. McGillicuddy must not have noticed . She yanked off her plastic apron , ripped off her plastic gloves , and pulled off her lunch lady hairnet . She threw all that stuff on the floor and stomped out of the vomitorium . I 'll tell you , there are a lot of crazy grown-ups at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever saw one of them actually go crazy , live and in person . It was cool . Miss Lazar , our custodian , came over with a mop . I feel sorry for her . Every time some kid spills something , she has to clean it up . " I love cleaning up messes ! " Miss Lazar said , mopping the apple juice off the floor . Miss Lazar is bizarre ! When all the excitement was over , Ryan put a carrot stick in his nose and ate it ( the carrot stick , not his nose ) . Michael made a sculpture out of tuna salad . I threw a cookie to Ryan , and he caught it in his mouth . Like I said , it was a pretty normal lunch . Continues ...
