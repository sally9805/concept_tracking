Return Bisesa Dutt gasped , and staggered . She was standing . She did n't know where she was . Music was playing . She stared at a wall , which showed the magnified image of an impossibly beautiful young man crooning into an old-fashioned microphone . Impossible , yes ; he was a synth-star , a distillation of the inchoate longings of subteen girls . " My God , he looks like Alexander the Great . " Bisesa could barely take her eyes off the wall 's moving colors , its brightness . She had forgotten how drab and dun-colored Mir had been . But then , Mir had been another world altogether . Aristotle said , " Good morning , Bisesa . This is your regular alarm call . Breakfast is waiting downstairs . The news headlines today are " " Shut up . " Her voice was a dusty desert croak . " Of course . " The synthetic boy sang on softly . She glanced around . This was her bedroom , in her London apartment . It seemed small , cluttered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She walked to the window . Her military-issue boots were heavy on the carpet and left footprints of crimson dust . The sky was gray , on the cusp of sunrise , and the skyline of London was emerging from the flatness of silhouette . " Aristotle . " " Bisesa ? " " What 's the date ? " " Tuesday . " " The date . " " Ah . The ninth of June , 2037 . " " I should be in Afghanistan . " Aristotle coughed . " I 've grown used to your sudden changes of plans , Bisesa . I remember once " " Mum ? " The voice was small , sleepy . Bisesa turned . Myra was barefoot , her tummy stuck out , fist rubbing at one eye , hair tousled , a barely awake eight-year-old . Shewas wearing her favorite pajamas , the ones across which cartoon characters gamboled , even though they were now about two sizes too small for her . " You did n't say you were coming home . " Something broke inside Bisesa . She reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You smell funny . " Shocked , Bisesa glanced down at herself . In her jumpsuit , scuffed and torn and coated with sweat-soaked sand , she was as out of place in this twenty-first-century London flat as if she had been wearing a spacesuit . She forced a smile . " I guess I need a shower . Then we 'll have breakfast , and I 'll tell you all about it . . . " The light changed , subtly . She turned to the window . There was an Eye over the city , a silver sphere , floating like a barrage balloon . She could n't tell how far away it was , or how big . But she knew it was an instrument of the Firstborn , who had transported her to Mir , another world , and brought her home . And over the rooftops of London , a baleful sun was rising . The Peak of Eternal Light Mikhail Martynov had devoted his life to the study of Earth 's star . And from the first moment he saw the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep in his bones , that something was wrong . " Good morning , Mikhail . The time on the Moon is two o'clock in the morning . Good morning , Mikhail . The time is two o'clock and fifteen seconds . Good morning . . . " " Thank you , Thales . " But he was already up and moving . As always he had woken to within a minute of his personal schedule , without need of Thales 's softly spoken electronic wake-up call , a schedule he kept independently of the Houston time to which the rest of the Moon was enslaved . Mikhail was a man of routine . And he would begin the day , as he began every day of his long solitary watches in this Space Weather Service Station , with a walk into the sunlight . He took a quick breakfast of fruit concentrate and water . He always drank the water pure , never polluted with coffee granules or tea leaves , for it was water from the Moon , the result of billions of years of slow cometary accretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robots ; he believed it deserved to be savored . He clambered briskly into his EVA suit . Comfortable and easy to use , the suit was the result of six decades ' development from the clumsy armor worn by the Apollo astronauts . And it was smart , too ; some said so smart it could go out Moonwalking by itself . But smart suit or not , Mikhail worked cautiously through a series of manual checks of the suit 's vital systems . He lived alone here at the Moon 's South Pole , save for the electronic omnipresence of Thales , and everybody knew that low gravity made you dumbthe " space stupids , " they called it . Mikhail was well aware of the importance of concentrating on the chores necessary to keep himself alive . Still , it was only minutes before he was locked tight into the warm enclosure of the suit . Through the slight distortion of his wedge-shaped visor he peered out at his small living quarters . He was a man equipped for interplanetary space , standing incongruously in a clutter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born of long practice , he pushed his way out through the airlock , and then the small dustlock beyond , and emerged onto the surface of the Moon . Standing on the slope of a crater rim mountain , Mikhail was in shadow broken only by sparse artificial lighting . Above him stars crowded a silent sky . When he looked uphe had to lean back in his stiff suithe could make out dazzling splashes of light high on the crater wall , places the low polar sunlight could reach . Solar-cell arrays and an antenna farm had been placed up there in the light , as well as the sun sensors that were the Station 's main purpose . This Space Weather Service Station , dug into the wall of a crater called Shackleton , was one of the Moon 's smaller habitats , just a few inflatable domes linked by low tunnels and heaped over by a layer of charcoal-gray Moon dust . Unprepossessing the hab itself may have been , but it was situated in one of the Moon 's more remarkable locations . Unlike the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no lunar sea- sons . And at the Moon 's South Pole the sun never rises high in the sky . There the shadows are always longand , in some places , permanent . Thus the pool of darkness in which Mikhail stood had been unbroken for billions of years , save by humans . Mikhail looked down the slope , beyond the low bulges of the Station domes . On Shackleton 's floor floodlights revealed a complex tangle of quarries and lumbering machines . Down there robots toiled over the real treasure of this place : water . When the Apollo astronauts had brought home their first dusty Moon rocks , the geologists had been dumbfounded that the samples contained not a trace of water , not even bound chemically into the mineral structures . It took some decades to unravel the truth . The Moon was no sister world of Earth but a daughter , created in the early days of the solar system when a collision with another infant world had smashed apart a proto-Earth . The debris that had eventually coalesced into the Moon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving off every trace of water . Later , comets had splashed on the Moon 's surface . Out of the billions of tonnes of water delivered by these lesser impacts , most had been lost immediately . But a trace , just a trace , had found its way to the permanently shadowed floors of the polar craters , a gift of water to the Moon as if in recompense for the circumstances of its birth . By Earth 's standards the Moon 's water was little enoughnot much more than a respectably sized lakebut for human colonists it was a treasure beyond price , literally worth far more than its weight in gold . It was invaluable for the scientists too , as it bore a record of eons of cometary formation , and offered indirect clues to the formation of Earth 's oceans , which had also been bequeathed by cometary impacts . Mikhail 's interest in this place was not lunar ice , however , but solar fire . He turned away from the shadows and began to toil up the steepening slope of the rim mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beaten flat by human footprints . It was marked by streetlights , as everybody called them , small globe lamps hung from poles , so he could see what he was doing . The slope was steep , each step an effort even in the Moon 's gentle one-sixth gravity . His suit helped , with a subtle hum from exoskeletal servos and a high-pitched whir of the fans and pumps that labored to keep his faceplate clear of condensed sweat . He was soon breathing hard , and his muscles ached pleasantly : this walk was his daily constitutional . At last he reached the summit of the mountain and emerged into flat sunlight . A small collection of robot sensors huddled here , peering with unending electronic patience at the sun . But the light was too brilliant for Mikhail 's eyes , and his visor quickly opaqued . The view around him was still more dramatic , and complex . He was standing on the rim of Shackleton , itself a comparatively minor crater , but here at its western rim Shackleton intersected the circles of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale : even the craters ' far rims were hidden by the Moon 's horizon . But with long practice Mikhail had trained himself to make out the chains of mountains , slowly curving , that marked the perimeters of these overlapping scars . And all this was thrown into stark relief by the low light of the sun as it rolled endlessly around the horizon , the long shadows it cast turning like clock hands . The South Pole , shaped when the Moon was young by an immense impact that had bequeathed it the deepest crater in all the solar system , was the most contorted landscape on the Moon . A greater contrast to the flat basalt plain of Tranquillity where Armstrong and Aldrin had first landed , far to the north close to the Moon 's equator , would be hard to imagine . And this peak was a special place . Even here among the mountains of the Pole , most places knew some night , as the passing shadows of one crater wall or another blocked out the light . But the peak on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steeper and a little taller than its cousins to either side , and so no shadow ever reached its summit . While the Station , only footsteps away , was in perpetual darkness , this place was in permanent sunlight ; it was the Peak of Eternal Light . There was nowhere like this on tipped-over Earth , and only a handful of locations like it on the Moon . There was no morning here , no true night ; it was no wonder that Mikhail 's personal clock drifted away from the consensus of the rest of the Moon 's inhabitants . But it was a strange , still landscape that he had grown to love . And there was no better place in the EarthMoon system to study the sun , which never set from this airless sky . But today , as he stood here , something troubled him . Of course he was alone ; it was inconceivable that anybody could sneak up on the Station without a hundred automatic systems alerting him . The silent sentinels of the solar monitors showed no signs of disturbance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casings , wrapped in thick meteorite shielding and Kevlar , would have told him anything . So what was troubling him ? The stillness of the Moon was an uncomfortable place to be having such feelings , and Mikhail shivered , despite the comfortable warmth of his suit . Then he understood . " Thales . Show me the sun . " Closing his eyes , he lifted his face toward the glare . When he opened his eyes Mikhail inspected a strange sun . The center of his faceplate had blocked much of the light of the main disk . But he could make out the sun 's atmosphere , the corona , a diffuse glow spreading over many times the sun 's diameter . The corona had a smooth texture that always reminded him of mother-of-pearl . But he knew that that smoothness masked an electromagnetic violence that dwarfed any human technologyindeed , a violence that was a principal cause of the damaging space weather he had devoted his own life to monitoring . At the center of the corona he made out the disk of the sun itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coal-like glow . He called for magnification and could make out a speckling that might be granules , the huge convection cells that tiled the sun 's surface . And just visible near the very center of the disk , he made out a darker patchobviously not a granule , but much more extensive . " An active region , " he murmured . " And a big one , " Thales replied . " I do n't have my log to hand . . . Am I looking at 12687 ? " For decades humans had been numbering the active regions they observed on the sun , the sources of flares and other irritations . " No , " Thales said smoothly . " Active Region 12687 is subsiding , and is a little farther west . " " Then what " " This region has no number . It is too new . " Mikhail whistled . Active regions usually took days to develop . By studying the resonances of the sun , immense slow sound waves that passed through its structure , you could usually spot major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stately rotation brought them into view . But this beast , it seemed , was different . " The sun is restless today , " Mikhail murmured . " Mikhail , your tone of voice is unusual . Did you suspect the active region was there before you asked for the display ? " Mikhail had spent a lot of time alone with Thales , and he thought nothing of this show of curiosity . " One gets an instinct for these things . " " The human sensorium remains a mystery , does n't it , Mikhail ? " " Yes , it does . " Out of the corner of his eye Mikhail spotted movement . He turned away from the sun . When his faceplate cleared he made out a light , crawling toward him through the lunar shadows . It was a sight almost as unusual , for Mikhail , as the face of the troubled sun . " It seems I have a visitor . Thales , you 'd better make sure we have enough hot water for the shower . " He began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan every step in advance despite his mounting excitement . " This looks like it 's going to be quite a day , " he said .
