<p> A Marine in Iraq scans a screen with images of the streets he 'll soon patrol . Spotting suspicious movement , he replays the digital video , just like a TV viewer who 's missed a play from a football game . <p> The cutting-edge surveillance system , called Angel Fire , uses aircraft armed with cameras to monitor the battlefield . It gives troops what U.S. commanders in Iraq have sought for years : a persistent , bird's-eye view to search roads and neighborhoods for improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) and the insurgents who plant them . <p> " Angel Fire distributes real-time imagery straight to the war fighter , providing the ability to zoom in and observe an area more closely , " John Young , director of Defense Research and Engineering at the Pentagon , told Congress in March . " Angel Fire also allows for playback of significant events with a ' TiVo-like ' capability to monitor areas . " <p> Despite Angel Fire 's advantages over other surveillance systems in Iraq , the system 's backers feared it would be killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On one side of the interservice squabble were officers of the Marine Corps and the Air Force , which have been developing Angel Fire since 2005 and regard it as a practical way to relay timely information to small units of troops in combat . On the other side was the Army , which backed an existing surveillance system known as Constant Hawk that surveys a much larger area but is more difficult to use and produces video that must be studied by analysts . <p> Documents and e-mails obtained by USA TODAY show friction among the services over how to rush the latest reconnaissance technology to troops under fire . Marine and Air Force backers of Angel Fire worried it would lose out to Constant Hawk . The Pentagon agency in charge of defeating IEDs finally intervened to fund both systems . <p> Air Force , Marine and Army officials now say concerns about the programs were reconciled and did n't delay the fielding of what they call lifesaving technology . " There is not currently , nor has there been in the past , a conflict with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who helps lead the Air Force 's Angel Fire program , said in a statement last week . " Both programs have shared information and are complementary , not competitive . " <p> The e-mails , however , paint a far different picture . They show Marine and Air Force supporters of Angel Fire were so concerned about the Army 's backing of Constant Hawk that they lobbied Congress to keep Angel Fire alive . <p> The Marines ' Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement , requesting Angel Fire , was filed Sept. 15 , 2006 , with the U.S. top command in Iraq . It encountered resistance from Mark Fultz , an Army official at the military 's command center in Baghdad who favored Constant Hawk , according to the e-mails . He urged the Marines to use Constant Hawk instead . <p> The Marines then began a campaign to save Angel Fire . Col. Phillip Chudoba , a Marine procurement official in Quantico , Va. , said in an Oct. 30 , 2006 , e-mail to Marine and Army officials that " the continual competition between ( Constant Hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war fighter . We have been trying to break through this logjam for months now . " <p> Air Force Gen. Lance Smith , in a statement to Congress in March , said Marines were testing Angel Fire on the battlefield . Smith , head of the U.S. Joint Forces Command , is cited in one e-mail as an advocate of Angel Fire . No more information will be released until November , after the testing is done , says Larine Barr , spokeswoman for the Air Force Research Laboratory . <p> Constant Hawk has been in operation about one year as a " pilot program , " the Army said in its statement last week . No other details were released . <p> Members of Congress have criticized the infighting and how it hindered Angel Fire 's development . " This program has encountered bureaucratic obstacles that have delayed the employment of the system to our war fighters similar to the hurdles we have observed elsewhere in the acquisition process , " Sen. Kit Bond , R-Mo. , said in a statement . The other examples he referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deploying mine-resistant , ambush-protected ( MRAP ) vehicles to protect troops from IEDs . <p> Bond added : " The current acquisition system shows signs of gross mismanagement that impacts the lives and health of our troops . These conditions have most likely existed for years , but they seem to be acute now . " <p> In the hunt for better equipment to combat IEDs , the stakes are huge . Makeshift bombs have caused at least 60% of the 950 U.S. combat deaths in Iraq in the past year . They have crippled , maimed and disfigured thousands more troops . <p> To stop the enemy 's weapon of choice , the Pentagon has spent billions of dollars on equipment ranging from electronic jammers that disrupt signals that trigger remote-controlled bombs to MRAP vehicles to replace the armored Humvee , the workhorse of the military . On Sept. 26 , Defense Secretary Robert Gates asked Congress for $11 billion to buy 7,000 MRAPs . In all , the Pentagon wants 15,000 MRAPs for troops in Iraq ; there are about 1,000 there now . <p> Meanwhile , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lead agency in fighting makeshift bombs , will use more than $4 billion this year to counter the threat . About $1.4 billion will go to surveillance technology including Angel Fire and Constant Hawk . <p> Like a security camera <p> Last fall , Sunni insurgents attacked Marines in western Iraq 's Anbar province daily , and al-Qaeda in Iraq vied with U.S. and Iraqi forces for control of Anbar 's capital , Ramadi . To help stop them , the Marines wanted a system that would provide continuous surveillance of a city-size area . Angel Fire 's replay feature promised to allow them to view an IED blast and trace it back to who planted it , just as police can rewind the tape of a convenience store 's security camera to reveal a robber 's identity . <p> Neither function is available on the aerial surveillance systems now used in Iraq . And Angel Fire , according to Defense Department documents , has the advantage of providing high-resolution imagery to hundreds of users simultaneously . <p> Since 2005 , Marine commanders have listed persistent surveillance as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked not to be identified . <p> In 2005 , graduate students at the Air Force Institute of Technology in Ohio and scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratories developed Angel Fire for " persistent , city-sized surveillance , " according to the institute 's website . " By providing real-time imaging capabilities , IED and other threats ... can be detected , prevented and/or negated . Angel Fire is particularly well-suited to provide enhanced situational awareness to forces operating in an urban environment , convoy operations or other ground operations . " <p> Much of the information about Angel Fire is closely held . USA TODAY 's descriptions are drawn from the testimony of military officials to Congress and public documents . The e-mails USA TODAY obtained were exchanged among Marine , Air Force and Army officials responsible for Angel Fire and Constant Hawk . Military officials confirmed the authenticity of the e-mails but spoke on the condition that they not be identified because many details about Angel Fire are classified . <p> By spring 2006 , a prototype of Angel Fire demonstrated its effectiveness at the Marines ' training base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The request for Angel Fire that the Marines issued in September 2006 was a plea to field the system as quickly as possible . Constant Hawk would have required retrofitting to meet the Marines ' needs , according to an e-mail on Oct. 31 , 2006 , from Chudoba , the Marine procurement official . He favored Angel Fire , he said , because Constant Hawk was 18 to 24 months away from satisfying the Marines ' specifications . <p> E-mails between Air Force and Marine officials from late October until mid-December , when $20 million in funding for Angel Fire was approved , show that the Marines worried about delays and the program 's possible cancellation because of the Army 's opposition . " Army seems intent on depriving Marines ( and soldiers ) of this capability , " Chudoba wrote on Nov. 3 . <p> Request ' not executable ' <p> More than a month after it was sent , the Marines ' request for Angel Fire was still under review by military officials in Baghdad . That led Marine Lt. Col. Susan Murray , an intelligence officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2006 , that " critical " needs such as Angel Fire are " supposed to be turned around in a matter of a couple days , not a few weeks ! " <p> That 's not always true , says Len Blaisol , director of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Integration Division . An urgent plea for winter clothing for a battalion in Afghanistan can be filled in a few weeks , says Blaisol , while a system such as Angel Fire may require months of testing before it 's fielded . <p> One unit that had to approve the Marines ' request was Multi-National Corps-Iraq , the top military command in Iraq . There , Fultz , an Army science and technology official , was involved in handling the request . In an Oct. 28 e-mail to Army officers , he called it " not executable . " He asked the Marines to rewrite their request and instead consider Constant Hawk , which he helped develop . <p> " As always , the problem is ground truth capabilities versus marketing , " Fultz wrote , suggesting the Marines might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week that Fultz did not want to comment , and he could not be reached by USA TODAY . The Army 's Research , Development and Engineering Command , where Fultz works , gave him an award this year for his work developing Constant Hawk . <p> Fultz 's position enraged Angel Fire 's developers . Chudoba , the Marine colonel , fired off a response to Fultz and other Army officials on Oct. 30 , arguing that Angel Fire " is the quick win that can place a powerful capability in the hand of our Marine and Army users NOW . " He said Smith , a four-star general , agreed . <p> Also on Oct. 30 , Gary Stradling , the Angel Fire project leader at Los Alamos , e-mailed Marine and Air Force officials to warn them the Army was pushing Constant Hawk " specifically to pre-empt USMC/Angel Fire . " Stradling said Constant Hawk cost $18 million in 2005 compared with $4.5 million for Angel Fire . " That is more than a factor of four cheaper , for a more capable product . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help from members of Congress , including Sen. Pete Domenici , R-N.M . Los Alamos is in New Mexico . Stradling was not available to comment , the Air Force said . Los Alamos did not respond to a request for comment . <p> Other e-mails were sent directly to staff members at the Senate and House of Representatives , urging them to raise the issue with their bosses and help speed delivery of Angel Fire . <p> The competition came to a head in December , when backers of both systems sought funding from the Joint IED Defeat Organization . That month , Angel Fire received approval and the $20 million in funding from the IED group . By March , the system was being tested in Iraq . Domenici supported appropriations for Angel Fire that jumped from $5.5 million in 2006 to $55 million in 2007 , says Courtney Sanders , a spokeswoman for the senator . JIEDDO spent $84 million on Constant Hawk in 2007 . On its website , the Army listed Constant Hawk as one of its top inventions of 2006 . <p> Today , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine Devries , spokeswoman for JIEDDO . Constant Hawk provides wide-area surveillance , she says , while Angel Fire serves as an " eye in the sky " for fighters . " There 's really not a competition . " <p> In an interview Tuesday , Chudoba said , " There were in fact some friction points . However , we were able to candidly discuss them with the Army and worked around whatever friction there was . " <p> USA TODAY was asked by the Marine Corps and the Air Force to limit descriptions of the Angel Fire system and its capabilities , to safeguard the security of the troops . USA TODAY agreed to that request . <p> # Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
