<p> Catch-and-release zones may be more about religious fervor than scientific fact . <p> At least when it comes to river smallmouth bass in Illinois . <p> Preliminary evidence from a five-year study on the Fox River suggests unmanaged zones may produce more large smallmouth than catch-and-release zones . <p> In 1997 , the Illinois Department of Natural Resources established a regulation study on the Fox River . <p> The area between the South Elgin and North Aurora dams was made a catch-and-release zone . Between the North Aurora and the Montgomery dams , smallmouth had to be at least 14 inches . A control area was established where the statewide regulations  --  three smallmouth of any size  --  applied . <p> Catch-and-release supporters have pushed for zones like those in many areas , including on Lake Michigan , the belief being that protected zones would produce more large smallmouth . <p> That did n't happen on the Fox . In fact , the catch-and-release zone saw a drop of a third in preferred-sized " smallmouth , those 14 inches and larger . <p> We kind of expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regulation in other parts of the state , " streams biologist Steve Pescitelli said . We have n't had real good success with river regulations in general . " <p> Smallmouth are affected by habitat more than hooks . <p> It seems there is a real high abundance of fish until 10 , 12 , 13 inches , then the abundance goes way down , " Pescitelli said . <p> The largest smallmouth in the study was 191/2 inches in five years . Even 18-inchers were rare . <p> What happens , some would argue , is harvest , but if you believe our data , that would suggest there is something else , " Pescitelli said . There must be some factor that increases mortality at that stage . <p> Mortality could be related to spawning . Mortality increases because it takes energy to produce gonads and because of the competition for spawning beds , particularly in these short sections of the rivers between dams . <p> Or it could be a lot more harvest that we do n't know about . We will hear of all these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much effect . Not that I am condoning that , but there is an overabundance of that size . " <p> But something definitely goes on before the smallmouth reach the quality size . <p> It is somewhat confusing , " Pescitelli said . There does n't seem to be any limit on forage . There 's lots of minnows and crayfish . That can be deceiving , too  --  there is always an optimal forage size . If they have to expend more energy to catch food , then it can be counterproductive . " <p> Pescitelli also had an interesting theory on why protected zones may have seen a drop in big fish . It just may be that a catch-and-release zone can increase the fishing pressure , " he said . <p> He would like to see some areas continue with catch-and-release , simply to gather additional data . <p> More restrictive regs for the tribs feeder streams may make sense , " he said . Smaller creeks may have more impact by angling . " <p> More important , Pescitelli wishes anglers would redirect their energies into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get them involved in issues like dams and water quality , which is kind of tied in together , " he said . What is probably even more important is limitation of habitat . Basically , 50 percent of the river is unhabitable . You do n't catch smallmouth behind the dams . " <p> Free-flowing rivers mean more than restrictive regulations . <p> You can e-mail Dale Bowman at outdoordb@aol.com . <p> BIRKIE SHORTENED : On Wednesday , officials of the Johnson Bank American Birkebeiner decided to shorten the famed ski event , slated for Saturday , from 51K to 25K because of poor snow conditions on some hills near Hayward , Wis . The 23K Kortelopet will go as scheduled Saturday . On Thursday , the Salomon Elite Sprints and the Son 's of Norway/Swiss Miss Barnebirkie ( for kids ) will go . On Friday , the Junior Birkie ( ages 10-15 ) , the Chequamegon Telephone Cooperative 10k Family Fun Ski and the Hayward Chamber of Commerce Citizen Sprints will be held as planned . <p> DRINK TO THAT : Sturgeon spearing started very slowly compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday , the total stood at only 516 . The season opened on Feb. 9 . In the previous two seasons , the season lasted only two days . But shorter spearing hours ( 6:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. ) , poor ice and cloudy water have kept down the kill . On opening day this year , only 227 sturgeon were speared , even though 4,368 shanties were counted . That compares with the 1,074 sturgeon speared and 4,997 shanties counted on opening day last year . <p> Generally , the half-day emergency rule has been well accepted by the spearers , " biologist Ron Bruch says . The local establishments are very pleased with it . They 've got booming business now in the afternoon .

I was just wondering if you could give me a Web site with info on fishing there or call me . I have never heard of the lake and would like more info . <p> E-mail from Wayne Huffman <p> Q : Hello , are they going to open the cooling lakes this year ? <p> E-mail from George Bahnick <p> A : The two questions are related . With loss of recreational opportunities at the cooling lakes because of Sept. 11 , Chicago-area fishermen and hunters are forced to spread out in seeking big-water opportunities . Everything is in limbo ( especially with the recent series of alerts ) on any reopening of our cooling lakes ( Braidwood , Heidecke and LaSalle ) . One option is Shabbona Lake in DeKalb County , which had increased pressure after Sept. 11 . The other option is Downstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to like Powerton because the distance is manageable ( about a three-hour drive ) and the fishing from shore and boat is good . Boat fishing at Powerton opened Friday . The lake is open to shore fishing except during the central zone waterfowl season . Catfish and white bass are among the mainstays . But there are some surprisingly large yellow bass there , too . I like Powerton because of its monster smallmouth bass . For years , the rumor has circulated that 8-pound smallmouth are there , but the DNR denies ever finding one ( that would be a state record ) . But the lake has that kind of potential . To reach Powerton , take Interstate 55 South to I-74 West , then I-474 and exit Route 29 at Pekin . The lake is just south of Pekin . Winter hours are 8 a.m. -4 p.m .
