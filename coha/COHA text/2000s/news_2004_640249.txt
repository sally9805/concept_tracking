<p> Would n't it be fun if a TV chef walked off the set right into your kitchen ? How about rolling pasta with the pouty Rocco DiSpirito of ' The Restaurant ' ? Smoking up the grill with Bobby Flay ? Or having a quickie dinner with Rachael Ray of ' 30 Minutes ' fame ? <p> While it 's not the sexiest concept on television , ' America 's Test Kitchen ' and its prim host , Christopher Kimball , offer the best advice on how to cook real food . <p> Those other shows sell the sizzle . Kimball 's much more interested in the steak . <p> Of all the toques on TV , Kimball , who founded Cook 's Illustrated magazine and has written four cookbooks , is the most scholarly . He 's the only banjo-playing Deadhead of the bunch . And he does n't even watch TV . <p> Picture ' Bill Nye the Science Guy meets Julia Child , ' with a measure of Yankee reserve . Kimball cultivates the slightly nerdy image , although he 's anything but . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show lures 2 million viewers and Kimball 's publishing house , Boston Common Press , churns out books by the bushel . The whole shebang generated about $ 25 million in sales last year . <p> Kimball can be as exacting with his staff as he is about recipes and sales figures , but many cooks and editors have been with him for years . <p> John ' Doc ' Willoughby started writing for Cook 's in 1989 and recently left to become executive editor at Gourmet . <p> ' ( Kimball ) is a very smart , very smart , man , and he can be prickly and difficult . But he 's very self-effacing and can laugh at himself at all times . Chris does n't mind being criticized directly and forcefully , and he expects to do the same , ' Willoughby says from his New York office . <p> Instead of enduring the typical Q &A; session book authors undergo while promoting their work ( in this case , ' Baking Illustrated ' by the editors of Cook 's Illustrated ) , Kimball agreed to make lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how he would handle cooking in a typical suburban kitchen , far from the fully equipped cook 's paradise at the magazine 's headquarters where the show is filmed . <p> The deal : Kimball chooses the menu and does the cooking . An assistant does the shopping , and we do the dishes . <p> The menu : corn soup with coconut milk and ginger ; steaks with sherry-shallot pan sauce ; steamed potatoes with chives , shallots and parsley ; and German apple pancake . <p> He arrives on time , serious and focused in his bow tie and pink button-down shirt . Faced with unfamiliar , if run-of-the-mill , equipment , Kimball sets about prepping the ingredients for the soup . The knife is dull , the cutting board too small , and the pans have the wrong finish ( he prefers stainless steel to Teflon ) . But the stoic Vermonter soldiers on . <p> He requests lots of little bowls ( no worries about washing up here ) and cookie sheets to put them on . Just like on TV , we were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingredients on the baking trays . <p> At the magazine and for the show , test cooks follow the same procedure , placing all the ingredients , along with a copy of the recipe and necessary equipment , on trays . This ' be-prepared ' approach allows the cook to concentrate on the cooking , Kimball says . <p> The most important piece of equipment , a corn stripper his assistant bought at Bed , Bath and Beyond , turns out to be the wrong kind , so we set to scoring each row of kernels and scraping with the back of the knife to release their sweet milk . Accustomed to having a cadre of prep cooks , Kimball minces shallots and chops onions until the tears run . <p> As he works , we discuss his persnickety approach to food . ' We are very persnickety , that 's the right term , ' says Kimball , who remeasures a half-cup of flour Mom hands him . <p> Making recipes foolproof <p> The mission of Cook 's Illustrated is to make recipes relatively foolproof so people can cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says Kimball , known for testing a single dish up to 30 times to determine the perfect formula . ' The key to successful recipes is figuring out all the ways people can destroy them . ' <p> Kimball , 52 , did not attend culinary school , rather , he took ' a lot ' of cooking classes after majoring in primitive art at Columbia University . When he realized he could n't make a career of hanging out at the Fillmore East , he started Cook 's in 1980 at age 27 . Then came ' The Cook 's Bible , ' ' The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook , ' ' The Dessert Bible ' and ' The Kitchen Detective . ' The TV show began in 2001 . <p> Kimball and his wife , Adrienne , a former Cook 's marketing manager , have four children , from 16 to 6 , and split their time between a Boston brownstone and the Vermont farm he often writes about . He muses about family life in his magazine column , sometimes just touching on food and reaching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' yes , but listen to this letter to his daughter : ' aon a cold winter 's morning , your world can be measured in inches from the wood cookstove while the rest of us pace off the universe in light years . Your day is measured by the length of a crayon , the size of a lollipop , the pieces of a puzzle . ' <p> Kimball measures his days on airplanes and in interviews while on tour promoting his latest project , but he always returns home on the weekends , to cook , something he does n't do as often as he 'd like . <p> Kimball chose our lunch menu for its simplicity . The soup would have been quick if we had the right scraper , but the sweet , creamy result is worth the work : perfumed with coconut and a surprising bite of ginger . <p> ' I do n't cook a lot of complicated food , ' says Kimball , and neither do his readers . ' Most people do n't cook that differently . They like familiar food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potatoes . Kimball sears the steaks and tops them with a tangy pan sauce , accompanied by **25;509;TOOLONG tiny red new potatoes . <p> As we ' mmmm ' over the German apple pancake , Kimball acknowledges he learned something , too - that he could improvise and still succeed . But I think he already knew that . <p> Those other TV chefs could learn a thing or two from Christopher Kimball . He can bring home the steak , make it sizzle and tell you why . Who cares if the food is sexy when it tastes this good ? <p> ' America 's Test Kitchen ' airs at 2 p.m .
