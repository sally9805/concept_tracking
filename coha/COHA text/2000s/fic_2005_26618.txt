The Good , the Bad , and the Undead Chapter One I hitched the canvas strap holding the watering canister higher up on my shoulder and stretched to get the nozzle into the hanging plant . Sunlight streamed in , warm through my blue institutional jumpsuit . Past the narrow plate-glass windows was a small courtyard surrounded by VIP offices . Squinting from the sun , I squeezed the handle of the watering hose , and the barest hint of water hissed through . There was a burst of clattering computer keys , and I moved to the next plant down . Phone conversation filtered in from the office past the reception desk , accompanied by a belly laugh that sounded like the bark of a dog . Weres . The higher up in the pack they were , the more human looking they managed , but you could always tell when they laughed . I glanced down the row of hanging plants before the windows to the freestanding fish tank behind the receptionist 's desk . Yup . Cream-colored fins . Black spot on right side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing them in Cincinnati 's annual fish show . Last year 's winner was always displayed in his outer office , but now there were two fish , and the Howlers ' mascot was missing . Mr. Ray was a Den boy , a rival of Cincinnati 's all Inderland baseball team . It did n't take much to put two and two together and get stolen fish . " So , " the cheerful woman behind the desk said as she stood to drop a ream of paper into the printer 's hopper . " Mark is on vacation ? He did n't tell me . " I nodded , not looking at the secretary dressed in her snappy cream-colored business suit as I dragged my watering equipment down another three feet . Mark was taking a short vacation in the stairwell of the building he had been servicing before this one . Knocked out with a short-term sleepy-time potion . " Yes , ma'am , " I added , raising my voice and adding a slight lisp . " He told me what plants to water , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she spotted them . They did n't go with the working plant-girl image . I should have thought of that earlier . " All the ones on this floor , and then the arboretum on the roof . " The woman smiled to show me her slightly larger teeth . She was a Were , and fairly high up in the office pack by her amount of polish . And Mr. Ray would n't have a dog for a secretary when he could pay a high enough salary for a bitch . A faint scent of musk came from her , not unpleasant . " Did Mark tell you about the service elevator at the back of the building ? " she said helpfully . " It 's easier than lugging that cart up all those stairs . " " No , ma'am , " I said , pulling the ugly cap with the plantman logo on it tighter to my head . " I think he 's making everything just hard enough that I do n't try to take his territory . " Pulse quickening , I pushed Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watering system farther down the line . I had known of the elevator , along with the placement of the six emergency exits , the pulls for the fire alarm , and where they kept the doughnuts . " Men , " she said , rolling her eyes as she sat before her screen again . " Do n't they realize that if we wanted to rule the world , we could ? " I gave her a noncommittal nod and squirted a tiny amount of water into the next plant . I kinda thought we already did . A tight hum rose over the whirl of the printer and the faint office chatter . It was Jenks , my partner , and he was clearly in a bad mood as he flew out of the boss 's back office and to me . His dragonfly wings were bright red in agitation , and pixy dust sifted from him to make temporary sunbeams . " I 'm done with the plants in there , " he said loudly as he landed on the rim of the hanging pot in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look like a middle-age Peter Pan grown up to be a trashman in his little blue jumpsuit . His wife had even sewn him a matching cap . " All they need is water . Can I help you out here with anything , or can I go back and sleep in the truck ? " he added acerbically . I took the watering canister off me , setting it down to unscrew the top . " I could use a fertilizer pellet , " I prompted , wondering what his problem was . Grumbling , he flew to the cart and started rummaging . Green twist ties , stakes , and used pH test strips flew everywhere . " Got one , " he said , coming up with a white pellet as large as his head . He dropped it in the canister and it fizzed . It was n't a fertilizer pellet but an oxygenator and slime-coat promoter . What 's the point of stealing a fish if it dies in transport ? " Oh my God , Rachel , " Jenks whispered as he landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyester ! " My tension eased as I realized where his bad mood came from . " It 'll be okay . " " I 'm breaking out ! " he said , scratching vigorously under his collar . " I ca n't wear polyester . Pixies are allergic to polyester . Look . See ? " He tilted his head so his blond hair shifted from his neck , but he was too close to focus on . " Welts . And it stinks . I can smell the oil . I 'm wearing dead dinosaur . I ca n't wear a dead animal . It 's barbaric , Rache , " he pleaded . " Jenks ? " I screwed the cap lightly back onto the canister and hung it over my shoulder , pushing Jenks from me in the process . " I 'm wearing the same thing . Suck it up . " " But it stinks ! " I eyed him hovering before me . " Prune something , " I said through gritted teeth . He flipped me off with both hands , hovering backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vile blue jumpsuit , I found my snippers ...
