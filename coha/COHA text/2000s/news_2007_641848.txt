<p> For the past two years , some of the Avalanche 's best young minor-league prospects have been taught in the ways of the Carolina Hurricanes . Being that the Hurricanes won the Stanley Cup in 2006 , some might consider that a good thing . But the Avalanche never thought so . <p> If you have kids , you do n't want someone else raising them . So , for the first time since the Avs moved to Denver , they are in total control of their best prospects . <p> It 's all part of an organization-wide shift to create a new culture . It 's not just hockey . It 's Avalanche hockey . <p> " It 's taking pride , in the organization , in the Avalanche sweater , " Avs general manager Francois Giguere said . " Now we can school them in that ourselves , and develop a better relationship with our younger players earlier than we have before . " <p> The Avs have been one of hockey 's best teams over the past 11 years , but they 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise , there was still much of the culture of the Quebec Nordiques in place . When the team moved to Denver in 1995 , it took several months just to decide on a new name . <p> On the ice , the Avs carved out an impressive rsum , doing whatever it took to win . <p> But it has been a source of frustration to management not to be able to imprint its philosophies on players before they reach the big club . In the new salary-cap era of the NHL , management felt it was time to change everything from the marketing strategy at the top to developing talent on the farm . <p> On the ice , that means playing and teaching an up-tempo , aggressive brand of hockey . Off the ice , it means fostering a more family-type feel throughout the organization . To that end , the team has looked to former players such as Craig Billington , Steve Konowalchuk and Sylvain Lefebvre to fill key management positions in the development of young prospects and spread the Avs ' gospel . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the pride of wearing that jersey , " Giguere said . " To me , that 's what you 're trying to create with a young player , before they even get to the NHL level . " <p> Billington , a former backup goalie to Patrick Roy , serves as the Avs ' director of player development . Konowalchuk , who retired from the Avs last year because of a heart ailment , is Billington 's assistant , as player development coordinator . Lefebvre , a former defenseman who played on the Avs ' 1996 Stanley Cup-winning team , is an assistant coach with the expansion Lake Erie Monsters , the Avs ' new farm club in the American Hockey League . From the general manager on down to the trainer , the Avs control all aspects of the Monsters ' operations . <p> " Now it 's really important to build from within , with the salary cap , " Konowalchuk said . " You can only buy so many free agents now . You really need young guys consistently coming through your lineup , pushing the vets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our young guys are ready when they get here , who know what our organization is all about and can put names to faces throughout . " <p> Apart from making him feel older , Avalanche captain Joe Sakic thinks having his former teammates work with younger players is a great idea . <p> " They know what kinds of things the organization stands for . I think all the great teams have that feeling of tradition that gets passed down to the younger guys , " Sakic said . <p> For the past two years , the Avs ' top minor-league prospects played under coach Tom Rowe , last season in Albany , N.Y. , and in Lowell , Mass. , the previous year . Rowe was an employee of the Hurricanes , who , under a joint agreement with the Avs , also supplied players to the team . The management was controlled by Carolina . <p> The Monsters , who will play at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland , are owned by Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert . But everything that happens on the ice is controlled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winning difference in years to come . <p> " Before , the culture was that of the Hurricanes , " Quenne- <p> ville said . " It was their system at Albany . It was their coach 's decision about where our guys played , who got promoted , how much ice time they got . Now we can talk to our own guys on their bench , and better implement the kind of style we try to play as an organization , which is fast and aggressive and always on the puck . " <p> Giguere said he is n't trying to pattern the Avs after any other sports franchise . He just wants the Avalanche - a franchise that began in Quebec in 1972 - to stand for something . Above all , that means winning , but with a certain style . <p> " We always want to be looking to the future , but also honoring and respecting our past , " Giguere said . <p> Adrian Dater : 303-954-1360 or adater@denverpost.com  --  Breeds apart <p> With the Avs making a push to establish their style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' careers , NHL reporter Adrian Dater looks at teams from various sports that were distinctive in style and culture : <p> Philadelphia Flyers , early 1970s <p> They were the " Broad Street Bullies , " a team that did n't just beat you , but beat you up doing it . Hardscrabble players such as Dave Schultz , Bobby Clarke and Andre Dupont were loved by Flyers fans and loathed by everyone else . <p> Nuggets , <p> 1970s and 1980s <p> The Nuggets used the mile-high altitude to run , run , run their opponents into submission . <p> Boston Red Sox , <p> 1970s and 1980s <p> With the Green Monster in left , Red Sox management tailored the teams around it at Fenway Park . Big , right-handed sluggers were prized above all else . <p> Los Angeles Lakers , 1980s <p> It was always " Showtime " at the old Great Western Forum when Magic Johnson and the fast-breaking Lakers took the floor . <p> Los Angeles Dodgers , 1960s <p> The Dodgers beat you with speed on the bases and a dominant pitching staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were enough . <p> Detroit Pistons , late 1980s <p> The " Bad Boys " were the NBA 's version of the Flyers of the early 1970s NHL . Playing mostly a methodical , defense-first game , the Pistons would n't hesitate to win dirty , either . <p> New Jersey Devils , mid-1990s <p> The Devils seemed to bore opponents to death with a trapping defense that prized patience and little offensive freedom . <p> Green Bay Packers , 1960s
