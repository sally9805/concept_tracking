Snare Noon Detonation in twelve hours With a crystal-shattering shriek , the bit of the power drill bored deep into the Arctic ice . Gray-white slush churned out of the hole , sluiced across the crusted snow , and refroze in seconds . The flared auger was out of sight , and most of the long steel shank also had disappeared into the four-inch-diameter shaft . Watching the drill , Harry Carpenter had a curious premonition of imminent disaster . A faint flicker of alarm . Like a bird shadow fluttering across a bright landscape . Even inside his heavily insulated clothing , he shivered . As a scientist , Harry respected the tools of logic , method , and reason , but he had learned never to discount a hunchespecially on the ice , where strange things could happen . He was unable to identify the source of his sudden uneasiness , though occasional dark forebodings were to be expected on a job involving high explosives . The chance of one of the charges detonating prematurely , killing them all , was slim to nil . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the team 's demolitions expert , switched off the drill and stepped back from it . In his white Gore-Tex/Thermolite storm suit , fur-lined parka , and fur-lined hood , Pete resembled a polar bearexcept for his dark brown face . Claude Jobert shut down the portable generator that supplied power to thedrill . The resultant hush had an eerie quality of expectancy so intense that Harry glanced behind himself and then up into the sky , half convinced that something was rushing or falling toward him . If Death kissed anyone today , it was more likely to rise up from below than to descend upon them . As the bleak afternoon began , the three men were preparing to lower the last hundred-pound explosive charge deep into the ice . It was the sixtieth demolitions package that they had handled since the previous morning , and they were all uneasily conscious of standing upon enough high-yield plastic explosives to destroy them in an apocalyptic flash . No fertile imagination was required to picture themselves dying in these hostile climes : The icecap was a perfect graveyard , utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluish-white plains led off in all directions , somber and moody during that long season of nearly constant darkness , brief twilight , and perpetual overcast . At the moment , visibility was fair because the day had drawn down to that time when a vague , cloud-filtered crescent of sunlight painted the horizon . However , the sun had little to illuminate in the stark landscape . The only points of elevation were the jagged pressure ridges and hundreds of slabs of icesome only as large as a man , others bigger than housesthat had popped from the field and stood on end like gigantic tombstones . Pete Johnson , joining Harry and Claude at a pair of snowmobiles that had been specially rebuilt for the rigors of the pole , told them , " The shaft 's twenty-eight yards deep . One more extension for the bit , and the job 's done . " " Thank God ! " Claude Jobert shivered as if his thermal suit provided no protection whatsoever . In spite of the transparent film of petroleum jelly that protected the exposed portions of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll make it back to base camp tonight . Think of that ! I have n't been warm one minute since we left . " Ordinarily , Claude did n't complain . He was a jovial , energetic little man . At a glance , he seemed fragile , but that was not the case . At five seven and a hundred thirty pounds , he was lean , wiry , hard . He had a mane of white hair now tucked under his hood , a face weathered and made leathery by a lifetime in extreme climates , and bring blue eyes as clear as those of a child . Harry had never seen hatred or anger in those eyes . Until yesterday , he had never seen self-pity in them , either , not even three years ago , when Claude lost his wife , Colette , in a sudden , senseless act of violence ; he had been consumed by grief but had never wallowed in self-pity . Since they had left the comfort of Edgeway Station , however , Claude had been neither jovial nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At fifty-nine , he was the oldest member of the expedition , eighteen years older than Harry Carpenter , which was the outer limit for anyone working in those brutal latitudes . Although he was a fine arctic geologist specializing in the dynamics of ice formation and movement , the current expedition would be his last trip to either pole . Henceforth , his research would be done in laboratories and at computers , for from the severe conditions of the icecap . Harry wondered if Jobert was bothered less by the bitter cold than by the knowledge that the work he loved had grown too demanding for him . One day Harry would have to face the same truth , and he was n't sure that he would be able to exit with grace . The great chaste spaces of the Arctic and Antarctic enthralled him : the power of the extreme weather , the mystery that cloaked the white geometric landscapes and pooled in the purple shadows of every seemingly unplumbable crevasse , the spectacle on clear night when the aurora borealis splashed the sky with shimmering streamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stars when the curtains of the aurora drew back to reveal them . In some ways he was still the kid who had grown up on a quiet farm in Indiana , without brothers or sisters or playmates : the lonely boy who 'd felt stifled by the life into which he 'd been born , who 'd daydreamed of traveling to far places and seeing all the exotic marvels of the world , who 'd wanted never to be tied down to one plot of earth , and who 'd yearned for adventure . He was a grown man now , and he knew that adventure was hard work . Yet , from time to time , the boy within him was abruptly overcome by wonder , stopped whatever he was doing , slowly turned in a circle to look at the dazzlingly white world around him , and thought : Holy jumping catfish , I 'm really here , all the way from Indiana to the end of the earth , the top of the world ! Pete Johnson said , " It 's snowing . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending in a silent ballet . The day was windless , though the calm might not endure much longer . Claude Jobert frowned . " We were n't due for this storm until this evening . " The trip out from Edgeway Stationwhich lay four air miles to the northeast of their temporary camp , six miles by snowmobile past ridges and deep chasmshad not been difficult . Nevertheless , a bad storm might make the return journey impossible . Visibility could quickly deteriorate to zero , and they could easily get lost because of compass distortion . And if their snowmobiles ran out of fuel , they would freeze to death , for even their thermal suits would be insufficient protection against prolonged exposure to the more murderous cold that would ride in on the back of a blizzard . Deep snows were not as common on the Greenland cap as might have been expected , in part because of the extreme lows to which the air temperature could sink .. At some point in virtually every blizzard , the snowflakes metamorphosed into spicules of ice , but even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Maybe it 's a local squall . " " Yes , that 's just what Online Weather said last week about that storm , " Claude reminded him . " We were to have only local squalls on the periphery of the main event . Then we had so much snow and ice it would 've kept Pre Nol home on Christmas Eve . " " So we 'd better finish this job quickly . " " Yesterday would be good . " As if to confirm the need for haste , a wind sprang up from the west , as crisp and odorless as a wind could be only if it was coming off hundreds of miles of barren ice . The snowflakes shrank and began to descend at an angle , no longer spiraling prettily like flakes in a crystal bibelot . Pete freed the drill from the shank of the buried bit and lifted it out of its supportive frame , handling it as if it weighed a tenth of its actual eighty-five pounds . A decade ago he had been a football star at Penn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't wanted to play out the role that society dictated for every six-foot-four-inch , two-hundred-pound black football hero . Instead , he had won scholarships , earned two degrees , and taken a well-paid position with a computer-industry think tank . Now he was vital to Harry 's expedition . He maintained the electronic data-gathering equipment at Edgeway , and having designed the explosive devices , he was the only one who could deal with them in full confidence if something went wrong . Furthermore , his tremendous strength was an asset out there on the inhospitable top of the world . As Pete swung the drill out of the way , Harry and Claude lifted a three-foot bit extension from one of the cargo trailers that were coupled to the snowmobiles . They screwed it onto the thread shank , which was still buried in the ice . Claude started the generator again . Pete slammed the drill in place , turned the keyless chuck to clamp the jaws tight around the shank , and finished boring the twenty-nine-yard-deep shaft , at the bottom of which they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared , Harry gazed at the heavens . Within the past few minutes , the weather had deteriorated alarmingly . Most of the ashen light had faded from behind the oppressive overcast . So much snow was falling that the sky no longer was mottled with grays and black ; nothing whatsoever of the actual cloud cover could be seen through the crystalline torrents . Above them was only a deep , whirling whiteness . Already shrinking and becoming grainlike , the flakes lightly pricked his greased face . The wind escalated to perhaps twenty miles an hour , and its song was a mournful drone . Harry still sensed oncoming disaster . The feeling was formless , vague , but unshakable . As a boy on the farm , he had never realized that adventure was hard work , although he had understood that it was dangerous . To a kid , danger had been part of the appeal . In the process of growing up , however , as he 'd lost both parents to illness and learned the violent ways of the world , he had ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he admitted to a certain perverse nostalgia for the innocence that had once made it possible to find a pleasurable thrill in the taking of mortal risks . Claude Jobert leaned close and shouted above the noise from the wind and the grinding auger : " Do n't worry , Harry . We 'll be back at Edgeway soon . Good brandy , a game of chess , Benny Goodman on the CD player , all the comforts . " Harry Carpenter nodded . He continued to study the sky . 12:20 In the telecommunications shack at Edgeway Station , Gunvald Larsson stood at the single small window , chewing nervously on the stem of his unlit pipe and peering out at the rapidly escalating storm . Relentless tides of snow churned through the camp , like ghost waves from an ancient sea that had evaporated millennia ago . Half an hour earlier , he 'd scraped the ice off the outside of the triple-pane window , but already feathery new patterns of crystals were regrowing along the perimeter of the glass . In an hour , another blinding cataract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edgeway Station looked so isolatedand contrasted so boldly with the environment in which it stoodthat it might have been humanity 's only outpost on an alien planet . It was the only splash of color on the white , silver , and alabaster fields . The six canary-yellow Nissen huts had been airlifted onto the icecap in prefabricated sections at tremendous effort and expense . Each one-story structure measured twenty by fifteen feet . The wallslayers of sheet metal and lightweight foam insulationwere riveted to hooped girders , and the floor of each hut was countersunk into the ice . As unattractive as slum buildings and hardly less cramped than packing crates , the huts were nonetheless dependable and secure against the wind . A hundred yards north of the camp , a smaller structure stood by itself . It housed the fuel tanks that fed the generators . Because the tanks held diesel fuel , which could burn but could n't explode , the danger of fire was minimal . Nevertheless , the thought of being trapped in a flash fire fanned by an arctic gale was so terrifyingespecially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which to fight itthat excessive precautions had to be taken for everyone 's peace of mind . Gunvald Larsson 's peach of mind had been shattered hours ago , but he was not worried about fire . Earthquakes were what troubled him now . Specifically , suboceanic earthquakes . The son of a Swedish father and a Danish mother , he had been on the Swedish ski teams at two winter Olympics , had earned one silver medal , and was proud of his heritage ; he cultivated the image of an imperturbable Scandinavian and usually possessed an inner calm that matched his cool exterior . His wife said that , like precision calipers , his quick blue eyes continuously measured the world . When he was n't working outdoors , he usually wore slacks and colorful ski sweaters ; at the moment , in fact , he was dressed as though lolling in a mountain lodge after a pleasant day on the slopes rather than sitting in an isolated hut on the winter icecap , waiting for calamity to strike . During the past several hours , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chewing on the pipestem , he turned away from the frost-fringed windowpane and scowled at the computers and the data-gathering equipment that lined three walls of the telecommunications shack . Early the previous afternoon , when Harry and the others had gone south toward the edge of the ice , Gunvald had stayed behind to monitor incoming calls on the radio and to keep a watch over the station . This was not the first time that all but one of the expedition members had left Edgeway to conduct an experiment in the field , but on previous occasions , someone other than Gunvald had remained behind . After weeks of living in a tiny community with eight too-close neighbors , he had been eager for his session of solitude . By four o'clock the previous day , however , when Edgeway 's seismographs registered the first quake , Gunvald had begun to wish that the other members of the team had not ventured so near to the edge of the ice , where the polar cap met the sea . At 4:14 , the jolt was confirmed by radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway . Severe slippage had occurred in the seabed sixty miles northeast of Raufarhfn , Iceland . The shock was on the same chain of interlinked faults that had triggered destructive volcanic eruptions on Iceland more than three decades ago . This time there had been no damage on any land bordering the Greenland Sea , although the tremor had registered a solid 6.5 on the Richter scale . Gunvald 's concern arose from the suspicion that the quake had been neither an isolated incident nor the main event . He had good reason to believe that it was a foreshock , precursor to an event of far greater magnitude . From the outset the team had intended to study , among other things , ocean-bed temblors in the Greenland Sea to learn more about local suboceanic fault lines . They were working in a geologically active part of the earth that could never be trusted until it was better known . If dozens of ships were to be towing colossal icebergs in those waters , they would need to know how often the sea was disturbed by major submarine quakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiating from the epicenter of a powerful quakecould endanger even a fairly large ship , although less in the open sea than if the vessel was near a shoreline . He should have been pleased with the opportunity to observe , at such close quarters , the characteristics and patterns of major temblors on the Greenland Sea fault network . But he was n't pleased at all . Using a microwave uplink to orbiting communications satellites , Gunvald was able to go on-line and access any computers tied into the worldwide Infonet . Though he was geographically isolated , he had at his disposal virtually all the research databases and software that would have been available in any city . Yesterday , he had tapped those impressive resources to analyze the seismographic data on the recent quake . What he discovered had made him uneasy . The enormous energy of the temblor had been released less by lateral seabed movement than by violent upward thrust . That was precisely the type of ground movement that would put the greatest amount of strain on the interlinked faults lying to the east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgeway Station itself was in no imminent danger . If major seabed slippage occurred nearby , a tsunami might roll beneath the icecap and precipitate some changes : Primarily , new chasms and pressure ridges would form . If the quake were related to submarine volcanic activity , in which millions of cubic tons of molten lava gushed out of the ocean floor , perhaps even temporary holes of warm water would open in the icecap . But most of the polar terrain would be unchanged , and the likelihood was slim that the base camp would be either damaged or destroyed . The other expedition members , however , could n't be as certain of their safety as Gunvald was of his own . In addition to creating pressure ridges and chasms , a hot tsunami was likely to snap off sections of the ice at the edge of the winter field . Harry and the others might find the cap falling out from under them while the sea rushed up dark , cold , and deadly . At nine o'clock last night , five hours after the first tremor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault chain . The seabed had shifted violently one hundred five miles north-northeast of Raufarhfn . The epicenter had been thirty-five miles nearer Edgeway than that of the initial shaker . Gunvald took no comfort from the fact that the second quake had been less powerful than the first . The diminution in force was not absolute proof that the more recent temblor had been an aftershock to the first . Both might have been foreshocks , with the main event still to come . During the Cold War , the United States had planted a series of extremely sensitive sonic monitors on the floor of the Greenland Sea , as well as in many other strategic areas of the world 's oceans , to detect the nearly silent passage of nuclear-armed enemy submarines . Subsequent to the collapse of the Soviet Union , some of those sophisticated devices had begun doing double duty , both monitoring submarines and providing data for scientific purposes . Since the second quake , most of the deep-ocean listening stations in the Greenland Sea had been transmitting a faint but almost continuous low-frequency grumble : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth . A slow-motion domino reaction might have begun . And the dominoes might be falling toward Edgeway Station . During the past sixteen hours , Gunvald had spent less time smoking his pipe than chewing nervously on the stem of it . At nine-thirty the previous night , when the radio confirmed the location and force of the second shock , Gunvald had put through a call to the temporary camp six miles to the southwest . He told Harry about the quakes and explained the risks that they were taking by remaining on the perimeter of the polar ice . " We 've got a job to do , " Harry had said . " Forty-six packages are in place , armed , and ticking . Getting them out of the ice again before they all detonate would be harder than getting a politician 's hand out of your pocket . And if we do n't place the other fourteen tomorrow , without all sixty synchronized charges , we likely wo n't break off the size berg we need . In effect , we 'll be aborting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think we should consider it . " " No , no . The project 's too damned expensive to chuck it all just because there might be a seismic risk . Money 's tight . We might not get another chance if we screw up this one . " " I suppose you 're right , " Gunvald acknowledged , " but I do n't like it . " The open frequency crackled with static as Harry said , " Ca n't say I 'm doing cartwheels , either . Do you have any projection about how long it might take major slippage to pass through an entire fault chain like this one ? " " You know that 's anybody 's guess , Harry . Days , maybe weeks , even months . " " You see ? We have more than enough time . Hell , it can even take longer . " " Or it can happen much faster . In hours . " " Not this time . The second tremor was less violent than the first , was n't it ? " Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean the reaction will just play itself out . The third might be smaller or larger than the first two . " " At any rate , " Harry said , " the ice is seven hundred feet thick where we are . It wo n't just splinter apart like the first coat on a winter pond . " " Nevertheless , I strongly suggest you wrap things up quickly tomorrow . " " No need to worry about that . Living out here in these damned inflatable igloos makes any lousy shack at Edgeway seem like a suite at the Ritz-Carlton . " After that conversation , Gunvald Larsson had gone to bed . He had n't slept well . In his nightmares , the world crumbled apart , dropped away from him in enormous chunks , and he fell into a cold , bottomless void . At seven-thirty in the morning , while Gunvald had been shaving , with the bad dreams still fresh in his mind , the seismograph had recorded a third tremor : Richter 5.2 . His breakfast had consisted of a single cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth quake had struck only two hundred miles due south : 4.4 on the Richter scale . He had not been cheered to see that each event was less powerful than the one that preceded it . Perhaps the earth was conserving its energy for a single gigantic blow . The fifth tremor had hit at 11:50 . The epicenter was approximately one hundred ten miles due south . Much closer than any previous tremor , essentially on their doorstep . Richter 4.2 . He 'd called the temporary camp , and Rita Carpenter had assured him that the expedition would leave the edge of the icecap by two o'clock . " The weather will be a problem , " Gunvald worried . " It 's snowing here , but we thought it was a local squall . " " I 'm afraid not . The storm is shifting course and picking up speed . We 'll have heavy snow this afternoon . " " We 'll surely be back at Edgeway by four o'clock , " she 'd said . " Maybe sooner . " At twelve minutes past noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles south : 4.5 on the Richter scale . Now , at twelve-thirty , when Harry and the others were probably planting the final package of explosives , Gunvald Larsson was biting so hard on his pipe that , with only the slightest additional pressure , he could have snapped the stem in two .
