" I 'm so stupid , " Jamie Warren wailed , tossing the crumpled tissue over her shoulder . Rich Manning , who was sitting across the kitchen table from her , held out a fresh one . " I trusted Tony , and he 's nothing more than ajerk . " <p> She yanked the tissue from Rich 's hand and ingloriously blew her nose . That tissue took the same path as the previous one . " I feel like the biggest fool who ever lived . " <p> " It 's Tony who 's the fool . " <p> " Oh , right . Then why am I the one sitting here crying my eyes out ? " Jamie really did n't expect him to answer . Calling Rich at an ungodly hour , sobbing out her tale of woe , was n't the most considerate thing she 'd ever done , but she had to talk to someone and he was the first person who 'd come to mind . <p> He was the kind of friend she felt comfortable calling in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately drive over if she needed sympathy or consolation . They 'd been close ever since they 'd worked together on their yearbook in high school . Although they did n't see each other often , Jamie had always felt their relationship was special . <p> " At least crying 's better than getting drunk , which is what I did when I found out Pamela was cheating on me , " Rich admitted with a wry twist of his mouth . He got up and poured them each another cup of coffee . <p> " You have n't seen her since , have you ? " <p> " Sure , I have . I would n't want her to think I was jealous . " <p> Despite everything , Jamie laughed . " You 're still dating her ? Even after you learned she was seeing another guy behind your back ? " <p> Rich shrugged carelessly , as though the entire situation was of little consequence , something Jamie knew not to be the case . Although he 'd been devastated , he 'd worn a nonchalant facade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His flippant attitude could n't camouflage the pain . <p> " I took her to a movie a couple of times , " Rich continued . " I played it cool . But as far as I 'm concerned , it was over the minute I heard about that other guy . " <p> " It 's over with me and Tony , too , " Jamie murmured . Just saying the words produced a painful tightening in her chest . She was truly in love with Tony and had been for nearly a year . They 'd often talked about getting married and raising a family together . Jamie wanted children so badly . The weekend before , they 'd gone shopping for engagement rings . Her mother , who was crazy about him , had been thrilled . Since Jamie was over thirty her mom tended to worry about her marriage prospects , but even she said that waiting for a man like Tony Sanchez had been time well spent . Sharing the bad news with her widowed mother had been almost as upsetting as learning about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's baby is his ? " Rich asked , reaching for her hand . " She could be stirring up trouble . " <p> " He did n't bother to deny it . " In the beginning , Jamie had hoped the woman was lying . She 'd searched Tony 's face , praying it was all some malicious joke . His beautiful dark eyes had turned defensive , but gradually the regret , the doubt , had shown , and he 'd slid his gaze away from hers . It had been a mistake , he 'd told her , a momentary slip in judgment . A one-night fling that meant nothing . He felt terrible about it and promised nothing like this would ever happen again . <p> Tony was cheating on her before they were even married , and Jamie did n't need a crystal ball to know that pattern would almost certainly continue . <p> " This is n't the first time , " she admitted , biting her lower lip to control the trembling . " Margie , in New Accounts , mentioned seeing Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd told me he was out of town and II was sure it was just a case of mistaken identity . I should 've known then . " <p> " Do n't be so hard on yourself , " Rich said , bending to brush a wisp of dark brown hair from her temple . " There were plenty of signs that Pamela was playing me for a fool , too , but I was so taken with her  --  " <p> " Bust line . Which was always your primary interest . " <p> " That 's probably why I never dated you , " he countered , grinning . <p> Jamie smiled . The joke was an old one between them . When they 'd first been assigned to work together on the yearbook , Rich had been a popular football player and she 'd been a nondescript bookworm . They 'd clashed constantly . One day , after a particularly nasty confrontation , she 'd shouted that if she had a bigger bust , he might actually listen to her . Rich had gone speechless , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice between them and they 'd been friends ever since . The best of friends . <p> " I hear there 's help in the form of surgery , " he teased , leveling his gaze at her chest . <p> " Oh , honestly . " Her breasts were n't that small , but it was comfortable and easy to fall into their old banter . Focusing on something other than what a mistake Tony had turned out to be provided her with a good  --  if mo-mentary  --  distraction . She 'd wasted an entire year of her life on him . An entire year ! <p> Rich reached for his coffee , then leaned back in the chair and sighed . " I 'm beginning to wonder if anyone 's faithful anymore . " <p> " I 'm the last person you should be asking that , " she said , taking a sip of her coffee . She did n't blame Rich for having doubts . Relationships all around her seemed to be failing . Friends , whose marriages had appeared strong and secure , were divorcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamie was sick of it all . <p> " When Mark Brooks cheated on my sister Taylor , she took that teaching position in another state , " Rich went on to say . " You know , I never much liked Mark . From the first I felt there was something off about him . I wish I 'd spoken to Taylor about it . " <p> " I felt so bad for her . " <p> " The whole family was worried . Then she moved to the backwoods of Montana and a few months later , she married Russ Palmer . Everyone was sure she 'd made a terrible mistake , marrying a cowpoke on the rebound , but I 've never seen her happier . And now Christy 's married to Cody Franklin . " <p> " Christy 's married to whom ? " <p> " The Custer County sheriff . She 's living in Montana , too . " <p> " But I thought she was engaged to James Wilkens ! Good grief , I was at her engagement party just a few months ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James is out of the picture . " <p> " Christy dumped James ? " It was hard to believe . Jamie had assumed they were perfect for each other . They 'd acted like the ideal couple at the engagement party , sipping champagne and discussing wedding dates with their families . <p> Rich chuckled . " If you 're surprised by that , wait until you hear this . While Christy was still engaged to James , she was married to Cody . " <p> Jamie was shocked . She did n't know Rich 's youngest sister well , but she would never have imagined Christy doing anything so underhanded . " I am surprised . " <p> " There were mitigating circumstances and it 's not as bad as it sounds , but Christy is yet another example of how fickle women can be . " <p> " Women ? " Jamie protested . " Men are notoriously untrustworthy  --  they always have been . " <p> It looked as though Rich wanted to argue . He straightened and opened his mouth , then shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've begun to think commitment means nothing these days . " <p> " I hate to be so cynical , but I agree . " <p> Standing , Rich carried his mug to the kitchen sink . " Are you going to be able to sleep now ? " <p> Jamie nodded , although she was n't convinced . However , she 'd taken enough of Rich 's time for one night and did n't want to keep him any longer . <p> " Liar , " he whispered softly . <p> Jamie smiled and got up , too . He slipped his arms around her and she laid her cheek against his shoulder . It felt good to be held . Rich 's comfort was that of a loving friend , someone who truly cared about her without the complications of romance or male-female dynamics . <p> " You 're going to get through this . " <p> " I know , " she whispered . But she had n't been confident of that until she 'd talked to Rich . How fortunate she was to have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added . <p> A sigh rumbled through Rich 's chest . " Do n't you wish life could be as simple now as it was in high school ? " <p> That remark gave Jamie pause . " No , " she finally said , then laughed . " I was so shy back then . " <p> " Shy ? " Rich argued , releasing her enough to cast her a challenging look . " You were a lot of things , Jamie Warren , but shy was n't one of them . " <p> " Maybe not with you . " <p> " I wish you had been , then you might 've done things my way without so much arguing . " <p> " You 're still upset that I did n't use your picture on the sports page , are n't you ? We 've been out of high school for thirteen years and you have n't forgiven me for using that shot of Josh McGinnes instead . " <p> Rich chuckled . " I could be upset , but I 'm willing to let bygones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it . " She led him to the door of her condo . " Seriously , though , I really am grateful you came . " <p> " Call if you need me ? " <p> She nodded . The worst of it was over . She would pick up the pieces of her life and start again , a little less trusting and a whole lot more wary . <p> Two months later , Rich was sitting in his office at Boeing when the image of Jamie Warren 's tear-streaked face drifted into his mind . It was as if their conversation had taken place just the night before  --  even though he 'd talked to her two or three times over the holidays , and she 'd sounded good . Cheerful , in fact . Certainly in better spirits than he 'd been himself . <p> She had n't made any attempt to fool him . Tony had hurt her badly . From what she 'd said , he 'd made several attempts to resume their engagement , but she 'd rejected the idea in no uncertain terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really know Jamie Warren . The woman was stubborn enough to impress a mule . Once she made up her mind , that was it . Oh , she appeared docile and easygoing , but Rich had collided with that stubborn streak of hers a time or two and come away battered and bruised . <p> It bothered Rich that Jamie had never married . She 'd always loved children , and he 'd fully expected her to have a passel of kids by now . <p> Most men , he realized , passed Jamie over without a second glance . That bothered him even more . <p> The problem , not that he 'd call it a problem , was that she did n't possess the looks of a beauty queen . She was n't plain , nor was she unappealing . She was just  --  he hated to admit it  --  ordinary . Generally , there was one thing or other that stood out in a woman . A flawless face . Cascades of shining hair , blond or gold or black Jamie 's was n't blond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't long , but it was n't short either . Some women had eyes that could pierce a man 's soul . Jamie had brown eyes . Regular brown eyes . Not dark or seductive or anything else , just brown eyes . Nice , but average . <p> She was about five-five , and a little on the thin side . Giving the matter some consideration , Rich noted that there did n't seem to be any distinguishing curves on her . Not her hips , and certainly not her breasts . He could be mistaken of course , since he had n't really looked at her that way. To be honest , he 'd never looked at her in any way other than as a friend . <p> She did n't have a body that would stop traffic . The thing was , a woman could have an ordinary face , but if she had curves , men fell all over themselves . Rich hated to admit something so derogatory about his fellow man , but he felt it was true . <p> What few took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . He 'd never known a more giving woman . What she 'd said about being shy was true , even though he 'd denied it . Yet she had spunk and she had spirit . Enough to stand up to him , which was no easy thing . <p> Pushing against the edge of his desk , Rich rolled back his chair and stood up . He headed down the hallway with determination . <p> " Bill , " he said , striding purposefully into his friend 's office . " Got a minute ? " <p> " What 's up ? " <p> Rich had never played the role of matchmaker before , and he was n't sure where to start . " There 's someone I want you to meet . " <p> " Oh . " Bill did n't look too enthusiastic . <p> " A friend of mine . " <p> " Widowed or divorced ? " <p> " Single . " <p> Bill 's brows arched toward his receding hairline . " You mean a leftover girl . " <p> Rich was n't comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to argue . " We went to high school together . " <p> " High school ? Exactly how old is she ? " <p> " Thirty-one . " Her birthday was n't until April . Their birthdays were both in April , and Jamie loved to point out that she was a whole week older . <br> Continues ...
