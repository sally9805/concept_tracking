I have a recurring dream in which I open the front door to my father 's house , and he has a slanted block of wood , the doorstop , in his hand . He thinks I 'm trying to break in . Without his glasses , in the unlit hallway , he thinks I 'm a burglar . He 's going to stop me with a 3 " x 5 " piece of wood . He squeezes the wood and gets a sliver in his palm , dropping the doorstop on his shoes . <p> Tissues bulge out of each pocket of his bathrobe . Underneath , he 's wearing khaki pants and a wool shirt . His hand is in his right pocket , jingling change . <p> Hello , he says . <p> It 's good to see you , Father , I say , although I 've never in my life called him " Father . " <p> There 's no light on in the house . It 's four o'clock in February , and I want a lamp , a candle , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the wooden floors . The windows are shut , and the shades are drawn . <p> Do n't track dirty snow into the house , he says . Go shake your shoes off outside . ( Growing up in California , I did n't see snow until I went east to college . ) <p> Random walls of snowdrifts rise out of the field , and in the dismal sun the trees reflect onto the snow like huge , broken umbrellas . The wind sweeps the snow off the ground , through the trees , and against the windows of the house . <p> In the living room , he rocks in his chair , with his feet on the stool . His hands are folded in his lap . He opens his mouth , but no words come out . Newspapers are scattered across the floor . I sit away from him on the springs of a couch without cushions . <p> Under the glass tabletop next to him is a black-and-white picture of him hiking in the mountains with a walking stick in one hand , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a backpack on and is half-turned toward the camera ; in the photo , sunlight glamorizes his face . <p> I lift up the glass , hold up the picture by its edges , and place it in front of him . <p> Look at this picture , I say . <p> I need my glasses , he says . <p> You can see without them , I say . <p> It 's fuzzy , he says . Get me my glasses . <p> A leather case is on the arm of the couch . I take out a pair of glasses that have sturdy black frames but no lenses . I hand the picture and glasses to him . <p> He ca n't hold the picture steady ; his hands shake and stop and jerk again . I reach over from behind him and point to his face . The collar of his bathrobe is specked with dandruff . <p> Look at yourself , I say . <p> His glasses are too large and rest on the tip of his nose . He looks over the frames to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I took that picture ; do n't you remember ? <p> No . Who is it ? <p> You . <p> He puts his hand inside his bathrobe and , with his chin pressed to his chest , studies his shirt . When he tries to drop the photograph into the pocket of his bathrobe , the photo slips out of his hand and drifts to the floor . <p> I open the window shade . Outside , to my surprise , it 's twilight . The wind snaps twigs off the tree limbs ; twigs fall into the snow . The snowdrifts are higher now . <p> Is the walkway clear ? he asks . <p> The walkway from the porch to the driveway to the street is two feet deep in snow . <p> No , Father , I say . Why ? <p> Let 's go for a walk . <p> It 's snowing out . It 's five below . <p> Let 's go to the post office . <p> You ca n't go out like that . You 'll <p> I 'm expecting a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At least change into something warmer . <p> The shovel 's on the porch . <p> I stand deep in the snow and dig into the snowdrifts on either side of me . A sudden gust of wind and the weight of the shovel nearly make me fall . He stands behind the screen door , wearing a jacket so big he could use it as a sleeping bag . The pockets are at his knees , and the hood is puffed out , framing his face . <p> There 's ice on the walkway , he says . <p> I hit the blade against the ice , but it 's frozen solid . He holds on to my arm and steps down off the porch , shuffling his feet until we get to the road , which is nearly a foot deep in snow . We trudge toward the post office at the end of the block . He holds on to my shoulder to prevent himself from falling . <p> Who wrote you a letter ? I ask . <p> You 'll see when we get there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get your hopes up . It 's probably been delayed . <p> The post office is an old brick building . Its cement steps are covered with snow , and its wooden door is halfway off its hinges . Inside are benches and a warped floor and a couple of hundred post-office boxes-rose-colored glass rectangles with black numbers . <p> He takes off his coat and uses it as a pillow , kneeling on the floor and turning the dials of a box , rattling it until it opens . He beats his right hand against the sides . <p> Well , you were right , he says . The letter 's been held up . Again . <p> Outside , the sky is blankly black , the color of my gloves . Too cold to move , he clings to my arm . Ice gathers on his hood , forming a comical cap . He stops to cough , closing his eyes and breathing heavily . <p> Are you all right ? I ask . <p> I 'm cold , he says . <p> The return trip is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly ends , with its odd impulse to phrase Oedipal unknowability as New England winter . <p> <p> By David Shields er Erickson ry 30 , 2001 <p>
