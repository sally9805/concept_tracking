For 30 days , a trim , fit , politically correct fellow named Morgan Spurlock took all his meals  --  breakfast , lunch and dinner , no exceptions , no excuses , no midnight raids on the fridge for a side salad  --  at McDonald 's while directing the film crews recording his horror story . <P> Some results of his ordeal , as reported in his documentary Super Size Me , are predictable : he gained 24.5 lbs. , and his cholesterol count shot up alarmingly . Some are less so : the amount of damage he did to his liver was roughly the same as if he had been on an alcohol binge of a similar duration . There is also evidence that he became something of a fast-food addict , with his sense of well-being increasingly dependent on the rush his fat-and fructose-laden eats provided . You come away from his film convinced that " Happy Meal " is something more than a trademark . For a certain class of Americans , it is the cheapest available source of bliss  --  ephemeral yet palpable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portrait of Spurlock growing increasingly gray , whiny and , finally , scared about what he 's doing to himself , it would be no more than an attention-getting device by a slightly smarmy man who rather lacks Michael Moore 's bullying star quality . Face it , even in a nation where a quarter of the population eats at least once a week in a fast-food joint , mass emulation of his diet is unlikely . <P> What 's best in Spurlock 's film is what 's most conventional about it  --  talking heads speaking persuasively about how a huge American industry seduces the innocent with cheesy toys and free playgrounds . In this effort , government at every level is complicit . The feds ship sloppy joe makings to grateful school-lunch programs  --  it 's the cheapest grub available . Other schools contract for pizza and sodas from corporate purveyors while cutting back on phys-ed classes . And everyone starts getting fatter younger . And sicker younger  --  with all the attendant social and medical costs . <P> Spurlock 's critics  --  some of them paid operatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gained weight force feeding himself Big Macs to the tune of 5,000 calories a day . One of his detractors put herself on an all-McDonald 's diet and managed to lose 10 lbs . in 30 days , eating fewer than 2,200 calories a day . Her movie is due out in late summer . <P> There is , however , one mystery Super Size Me and , indeed , most commentaries on the obesity epidemic do not address . Everyone knows that fat is ugly and that it kills . The press has been all over this story for years while at the same time celebrating the svelte and the diets that make them that way . So it 's not enough to say the fast-food industry 's propaganda trumps our mass desire to be slender . Something else must be operative here  --  some desperate need for sugary comfort that all the green , leafy vegetables in the world can not satisfy . We still say it 's spinach , and we still say the hell with it .  --  By Richard Schickel      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
