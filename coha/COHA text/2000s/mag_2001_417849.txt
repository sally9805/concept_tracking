Photograph Photograph At the national championships in December , Josh finds himself in a familiar spot-in front of the pack . // A harsh wind blew across the frozen fields in Overland Park , Kan . It was the type of raw , midwinter day that would discourage timid souls from venturing outside . No one could blame the competitors at the U.S. National Cyclo-cross Championships last December if they were anxious about the forecast . " It was 10 to 15 degrees , and the wind chill 40 below zero , so we were dressing for arctic conditions , " says Josh Anthony of Beverly , Mass. , racing in the 17-18year-old category . " The ice was the craziest part of it . The snow had melted the day before , then it froze the night before the race . " Conditions did n't look any better to Josh 's younger brother , Jesse , competing in the 15-16 division . " We were racing on solid ice , with 30 mile-an-hour crosswinds . " But in cyclo-cross-biking 's wild off-season cousin that combines road cycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed skating-the elements are never an excuse to stay indoors . " With cyclo-cross , you have to take whatever the weather throws at you , " Josh says . Part of the Team While the ultra-slick course scattered riders and bikes like pinballs , the Anthonys maintained control . Josh led his entire race and earned a spot on the U.S. National Under-23 team for the world championships in the Czech Republic in February ( he finished 43rd , gaining valuable worldclass experience ) . Jesse jumped to the front in his national age-group race with less than a lap to go . This past spring , the brothers signed to race for the Saturn Development Team , the amateur squad affiliated with the powerful Saturn Cycling Team . " That was cool , putting on the team colors for the first time , " says Jesse , who also won a national title in 1999 . " Now we have to perform and hold up our end of the bargain . " Brawn ... and Brains If hard work guarantees results , the Anthonys will deliver . The brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dabbled in road racing before trying cyclo-cross in the fall of 1998 . Both found an instant bond . Cyclo-cross mixes the explosive power of sprinters , the endurance of marathoners , the agility of gymnasts and the nerve of high-wire artists . And since the season runs from September through January , it can also mix sunshine , rain , hail , sleet and snow . Photograph Born : Nov. 6 , 1982 , Beverly , Mass . Lives : Beverly , Mass .

Photograph Jesse learned to race by following his brother to the Essex County Velo ( ECV ) team . // " When I started cyclo-cross , I started racing every weekend , and I got a couple of top-five finishes , " Josh says . " It 's really intense racing over a short period of time-45 minutes to an hour . A lot of things have to come together to make a good cyclo-cross racer . It 's not just pure speed , or pure technical skills . It 's a combination of those , as well as some unique skills , such as getting off and on . " What sets cyclo-cross apart from other bike racing is the dismount . Obstacles , usually between 15 and 18 inches high , are placed around the course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstacles and remount . The best racers perform this feat without any loss of momentum . And since the races are short ( mountain bike and road races can last anywhere from 90 minutes to four hours ) , riders go full bore from start to finish . " It 's not all about the fastest person , " Jesse says . " If you 're smart , and ride a good race , you can win even if you 're not the strongest guy . You have to be tough , you have to be competitive , and you have to know that the race is not over until you cross the finish line . " Ride , Sleep , Eat , Work Home-schooled with their five brothers and sisters , Josh and Jesse benefit from the flexibility to train whenever the weather cooperates . But the discipline to train hard , when others might be taking it easy , comes from within . And it requires sacrifice . " You have to give up a lot of things-movies , concerts or just hanging out with friends , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , eat and work . " That does n't mean the boys are not having fun . " I have to be careful of overtraining , " says Jesse . " Being competitive at a high level , you have to train a lot . But racing is fun , and I think I can go somewhere with it . When it 's not fun anymore , it 's time to stop . " This year , Jesse plans on joining Josh at the Worlds . But first , the Anthonys have set their sights on defending their national titles , no matter what the weather , the course or the competition throws at them . " I try not to focus on the suffering , " says Jesse with a broad smile . " I just think about winning . " Sidebar THE CYCLO-CROSS BIKE Sidebar The classic cyclo-cros , bike looks like a road bike , but there are Significant differences . * The rear triangle and fork have more clearance to allow for wilder tires and to help reduce mud build-up . * Tires are wider than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or muddy or sandy it is ) and have small knobs . Sidebar * Cyclo-cross bikes usually have cantilever brakes for mud clearance and control in messy conditions . The handlebars are the drop type typical in roads racing , for better handling and control than flat bars . * Cross bikes are usually much lighter than mountain bikes , since riders must carry the bike over parts of the course . * Front shocks are rare , since most courses have few rocky or roomy sections . And shocks add weight . // <p>
