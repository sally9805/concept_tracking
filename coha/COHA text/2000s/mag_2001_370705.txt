The garish orange livery of Stelios Haji-Ioannou is spreading over Europe like a virus  --  and his competitors have n't found a cure . This natural-born salesman , a 34-year-old combination of the cerebral and the showman , of rich kid and hustler , has a knack for presenting the consumer with a cheap service that 's free of the hassle and headache usually associated with discounts . He 's applying the idea liberally across a growing number of businesses under the umbrella of easy  --  as in easyJet , easyRentacar and easyEverything . <P> Everyone calls him Stelios . It 's part of a strategy inspired by Richard Branson , founder of Virgin . The idea is to become a populist icon behind a brand that is expandable to any number of consumer businesses . Populism is good for business , though a little odd for the billionaire son of a Greek Cypriot shipping magnate who spends his weekends in Monaco . Stelios started in his dad 's business of oil tankers but became famous with easyJet , a no-frills airline modeled on U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its planes are more than 80% full , compared with the European average load of 60% . <P> Then came a chain of Internet cafes called easyEverything , which pack ' em in by the hundreds for 24-hour cheap access to the Net ( $.25 to $3 an hour ) . There are 20 in Europe . A new cafe in New York City 's Times Square each week attracts more than 30,000 customers  --  students , people between jobs , travelers  --  with more U.S. outlets to come . The latest is his cheapo car-rental agency , easyCar , where prices start at $13 a day . " I like to invest in the brand , " he says , which he jokes means " being up front about it , loud , and hope someone picks a fight with you . " <P>  --  By J.F.O. McAllister
