John Carroll , editor of the Los Angeles Times , is sitting at the black marble table in his office , writing a headline for the next Sunday 's paper . Never mind that this is normally the job of a copy editor . Carroll likes the story  --  about a woman seeking the truth of her father 's death in 1948 and why the government covered it up  --  and he wants readers to be drawn in . But more important , Carroll believes that no detail is too small in making a great newspaper . And after four years of his leadership , the world is taking notice . Carroll and his colleagues will pick up five Pulitzers at the annual awards lunch later this month , the second largest haul in the history of the prizes . ( The New York Times won seven in 2002 . ) The total Pulitzer tally for the paper during Carroll 's tenure is 11 ; during the previous decade , the paper won just eight . <P> " The Times 's run on Pulitzers is a good indicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be laid at the feet of Carroll , " says Orville Schell , dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California , Berkeley . Even Richard Riordan , the former Los Angeles mayor who had long complained of the paper 's liberal bias , is a convert , won over by such coverage as the paper 's evenhanded reporting on racial tensions at a hospital in South Los Angeles . " I think Carroll has done a sensational job , " says Riordan , whose plans to set up a rival paper are now consigned to the back burner . <P> Born in New York City and raised in North Carolina , Carroll , 62 , previously edited the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky and the Baltimore Sun in Maryland . He maintains an elegant Southern gentility that leads him to preface his critiques with " I am inclined to think " and spreads credit for the paper 's success widely among his staff . But few doubt he is the force behind the Times 's renaissance , achieved at a time when editors of two rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past year , two of his peers  --  Howell Raines at the New York Times and Karen Jurgensen at USA Today  --  had to resign because of scandals in their newsrooms . <P> Back in the late ' 90s , morale at the Los Angeles Times had reached an all-time low . The business side was being run by Mark Willes , a former president of General Mills who was dubbed the " cereal killer " and was resented at the newspaper for firing journalists and attempting to break down the wall between advertising and editorial . This culminated in a scandal over a special issue of the Sunday magazine in 1999 devoted to the new Staples convention center in downtown Los Angeles . After the issue 's publication , it emerged that the paper had agreed to share the advertising profits with the Staples center , a fatal marriage of business and reporting . Many of the paper 's best reporters left during this period , and the rest of the staff was in open revolt against management . " My job during the Willes era was basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Washington bureau chief since 1996 . The paper was sold in 2000 to Chicago 's Tribune Co. , which offered the editorship to Carroll just as he was about to become head of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard .
