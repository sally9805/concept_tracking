<p> TUESDAY RANT <p> NFL NEEDS TO REWORK ARCHAIC CBA <p> New NFL commissioner Roger Goodell inherits the greatest sports league in North America when he succeeds Paul Tagliabue this season . Here 's one way to make it better : <p> How about reworking the Collective Bargaining Agreement so that players who perform get rewarded instead of first-round draft picks who have n't done a thing in the league ? <p> With a salary cap and a relatively finite salary pool , there 's no reason why the money ca n't be redistributed more equitably . And it would stop agents from playing both sides of the fence  --  holding out their first-round picks for big contracts that have not been earned on the one hand , then arguing that breakout-year players under contract deserve a new deal on the other . <p> If players like Lance Briggs and Nathan Vasher are wondering where their money is , it 's in the pockets of Cade McNown , David Terrell and Curtis Enis  --  who held out as rookies to get deals they did n't deserve and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential and performance ? <p> How much easier would it have been for the Bears to redo Briggs ' contract if they had n't lost millions on McNown , Terrell , Enis and others ? <p> ( An aside : What 's the deal with Thomas Jones ' offseason pout ? How can a guy who gained 373 yards ( 3.3 per carry ) after receiving a $5.7 million signing bonus as the No. 5 pick in the draft in 2000 have any gripe about Cedric Benson ? The Bears should give Jones twice as much as he gave back to the Cardinals in 2000 . ) <p> Is there something wrong with the NBA 's slotted system , where even LeBron James signed a three-year , $12.96 million rookie contract , leaving more money for veterans who have earned it . What 's wrong with that ? It seems like the only ones who would n't be happy are the agents . Are they ever ? <p> A SICKENING TREND <p> WORSE THINGS FIRST : CUBS CA N'T SEEM TO GET BETTER <p> When Cubs get hurt , why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has typified the frustration of the Andy MacPhail-Jim Hendry era , the disabled list has become a black hole for the Men in Blue . Mark Prior was supposed to return by mid-March . Kerry Wood was supposed to return by May 1 . Wade Miller by June 1 . Derrek Lee came back too soon . Freddie Bynum still is n't back . Will Sean Marshall ever come back ? And Glendon Rusch ... oh , forget it . <p> Of the nine players the Cubs have put on the disabled list this season , only one has returned to midseason form . <p> Reserve outfielder Angel Pagan , who returned after missing two months with a hamstring injury , is hitting .307 with four home runs and 10 RBI . <p> Everybody else has been subpar or has n't come back at all . <p> Maybe it 's just bad luck . Every team suffers injuries . But is any team as severely star-crossed as the Cubs ? The Cardinals lost the incomparable Albert Pujols to an injury in early June . He went on the 15-day disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out 15 days to a month . He missed two weeks . Since he returned , he 's not quite the <p> Pujols of old , but pretty close : a .351 average with nine home runs and 26 RBI in 46 games ( that 's a 31-homer , 92-RBI pace ) . <p> It seems like the Cubs are just as poor at diagnosing injuries and rehabilitating them as they are at taking a walk or hitting the cutoff man . Or maybe they just have the worst luck in the league . <p> If MacPhail and Hendry do n't notice the trend , you get the sense that Wood and Prior are starting to cease cursing their bad luck and wonder what is going on . <p> CUBS ON THE DL <p> Nine Cubs have spent time on the disabled list this season . Here 's how they 've fared : <p> Mark Prior right subscapularis strain <p> DL : March 28 ; April 26 ; July 14 ; Aug. 12 <p> Return : 1-6 , 7.21 ERA between DL stints . <p> Kerry Wood right shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 9 . Return : 1-2 , 4.12 ERA between DL stints . <p> Wade Miller elbow <p> DL : March 28 ( 15 ) ; April 21 ( 60 ) . Return : Still might be back . <p> Derrek Lee broken wrist <p> DL : April 21 ; July 24 . Return : .227 , 3 HR , 9 RBI in 20 games between DL stints . <p> Scott Williamson elbow soreness <p> DL : June 4 . Return : 7IP , 7.71 ERA before being traded . <p> Angel Pagan strained hamstring <p> DL : April 17 ; June 18 . Return : .307 , 4 HR , 10 RBI . <p> Glendon Rusch lower back spasms <p> DL : June 18 ; Aug. 3 . Return : 6.28 ERA between DL stints . <p> Sean Marshall strained oblique muscle <p> DL : July 23 . Return : Has missed three weeks . <p> Freddie Bynum shoulder inflammation <p> DL dates : June 25 . Return : Has n't played since . <p> QB ON FIRE <p> ROMO BURNING FOR COWBOYS <p> Former Eastern Illinois quarterback Tony Romo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kind of . <p> Romo 's outstanding performance in a preseason showcase against Seattle on Saturday night has fans in Big D wondering if he might be the choice over Drew Henson , the Michigan-pedigreed former New York Yankees farmhand , or whatever 's behind Door No. 2 to back up Drew Bledsoe this season . <p> Romo , getting a rare preseason opportunity to play the entire game , completed 19 of 25 passes for 235 yards and a touchdown in a 13-3 victory over the Seahawks . He scrambled five times for 18 yards . And he fumbled twice , but recovered both of them . His passer rating was 117.9 . <p> It 's just preseason , but that 's not bad for someone who has yet to throw a regular-season pass in four NFL seasons . <p> " I 'm a pretty confident guy . I think I can get the job done , " said Romo , who won the Walter Payton Award as the top player in Division I-AA and was a three-time MVP in the Ohio Valley Conference for Bob Spoo at Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game because you control a lot of the outcome . " <p> Coach Bill Parcells , who has been moaning about the dearth of No. 2 quarterbacks in the NFL , was absolutely ecstatic . <p> " He fumbled two snaps , " he said . " You ca n't do that . " <p> Well , maybe ecstatic is n't quite the word . <p> " He got us out of some trouble , " Parcells said . " He put a 19-play drive together . He made a couple of good back-shoulder throws . He generally managed the game well . He moved around in the pocket . I do n't believe we got sacked . Other than that , I 'm glad I got him the work . " <p> Romo knows better than to expect effusive praise from Parcells , who now is the matriarch of the dour , heavy-handed , anti-media , control-freak brand of football coach that is spreading through the NFL and the college game like wildfire . <p> " He 's not a man of many encouraging words , " Romo said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UP FOR TROOPS IN S. KOREA <p> Anybody who plays for former Army coach Mike Krzyzewski knows all about marching orders . But the players on the U.S. basketball team preparing for the world championships got a dose of the real thing Monday . <p> Krzyzewski , who served in the Army from 1969-74 , took his team to Yongsan Army Garrison in Seoul , South Korea , to meet and entertain U.S. troops stationed there . <p> The team was in Seoul to prepare for the world championships in Saporro , Japan , later this week . <p> According to the Associated Press , the U.S. team , which includes LeBron James , Dwyane Wade and Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich , went through drills and thrilled the crowd with alley-oop dunks and three-point shooting in the steamy base gymnasium . <p> " It felt great to come here and do something for the troops , " said Wade , the former Richards High School star . " It definitely helps us get motivated by realizing there are a lot of people behind us and we 're representing our country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That was a lot of fun , " staff sergeant Eric Jordon of Detroit said . " It was a privilege and an honor . For them to take the time to come here is impressive and means a lot to us . " <p> BOXER SHORT <p> TYSON KO 'S COMEBACK TALK <p> Can Mike Tyson save heavyweight boxing in America ? <p> Do n't count on it . <p> Odd as it sounds , Tyson could be the 21st century version of " The Great White Hope . " After Russian Oleg Maskaev upset Hasim Rahman , the Russians own every bit of the heavyweight championship : Vladimir <p> Klitschko ( IBF ) , Nikolay Valuev ( WBA ) and Chicagoan Sergei Liakhovich ( WBO ) . <p> Tyson , one of the most disappointing American athletes of our time , just turned 40 . He attended the Rahman-Maskaev fight in Las Vegas , and was asked if Maskaev 's victory tempted him to make a comeback . <p> " Hell , yeah , he told New York Newsday 's Wallace Matthews . " But forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can bring me back to this . " <p> We 'll see about that . Tyson declared bankruptcy in 2002 and still owes the IRS $8 million in back taxes . <p> And , as reported by Matthews , " no heavyweight in the Thomas &; Mack Center got the ovation Tyson received from the crowd of 8,000  --  not Maskaev ... nor Rahman ... nor Lennox Lewis , who spanked Tyson like a little boy four years ago in Memphis . It was a roar of thanks for electrifyingly brutal nights long past , and perhaps also a plea for a return to glory for a division that seems irretrievably lost . " <p> O.J. AND USC <p> FLOYD REMAINS ON HOLD FOR MAYO <p> O.J. Mayo ca n't make up his mind . <p> Or more likely , his people ca n't make up their minds . <p> Mayo , the Cincinnati schoolboy generally regarded as the No. 1 prep basketball player in the United States , canceled a news conference to announce he would sign a national letter of intent with USC  --  two hours before the scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has reportedly committed to USC without coming through . According to the Los Angeles Daily News , Mayo told friends he would announce for USC last month , but changed his mind . <p> The Daily News surmised that Mayo  --  who almost certainly would be in the NBA if not for the league 's minimum-age requirement  --  might be waiting to pass his entrance exams in the fall before making it official . <p> It should be nothing new for USC coach Tim Floyd . He once thought he might be coaching Michael Jordan with the Bulls . Instead , he got Brent Barry . The Bulls went 13-37 . Color Photo : Timothy A.
