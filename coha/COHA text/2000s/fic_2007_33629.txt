March , 1918 I used to be a conductor on the train that ran back and forth from Milwaukee to Chicago . Two or three times a year I acted in our local community theater , playing small roles mostly , but occasionally I was given a featured role . When the Milwaukee Players were putting on a play called A Brave Coward , by Winslow Clarke , I was given the part of a cowardly soldier during the Civil War who chooses , for the first time , to do something heroic . This was the biggest role our director had ever given me . Our community theater gave only three performances for each of our plays , and on the last night of A Brave Coward I was in the men 's dressing room applying some Skolgie 's theatrical glue onto a mustache I 'd made out of crepe hair , pressing it hard above my upper lip , when our director walked in . His name was John Freidel , but all the actors called him " sir " because we were a little afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were getting into costumes and going over their lines , and came up to my chair . " You 're late , Peachy , " he said . " Sorry , sir , I came right from work . The train was late . " " Sir " could be very sarcastic when he was giving notes , but I had n't heard him yell at anyone yet . He was a tall man and Ithought his knee would hurt when he kneeled down next to me on the hard wooden floor , but I certainly was n't going to interrupt him . He spoke confidentially , but he was very intense . " You 've been way too soft these last few nights , Paul . Terribly gentle and polite . A coward is n't a coward all the goddamn time , you know ? You 're starting to act like you 're scared to death . Will you loosen up for me tonight ? " " I 'll try , sir , " I said . " When the curtain goes up , forget the goddamn audience ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for me , Paul ? " " I 'll try . " Twenty minutes later my heart was in my throat . I heard the stage manager whisper " Go ! " and the curtain went up . There was silence for a moment as the audience waited , and then the first line was spoken . Thank goodness the play went well , and I know the audience liked me because they clapped especially loud when I took my bow during the curtain calls . I looked out into the audience while I was bowing and saw our director sitting in the front row . He gave me a smile and a little nod of approval . When the play was over I kept my mustache on , which I had purposely made the color of my wife 's auburn hair . I kept trying to picture Elsie when she saw it . Elsie and I had only been married for four and a half years , but the romantic part of our relationship seemed to have faded away , like the yellow roses in our backyard at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother in three rooms on the second floor of a small but clean house in the German-Polish section of Milwaukee . On the bus ride home a pretty girl and a soldier were sitting across the aisle from me , holding hands . The girl smiled at me . Without thinking , I touched my mustache and smiled back at her . Her boyfriend turned and gave me a hard stare . I dropped my head , pretending to be reading my theater program . When I got home I raced up the stairs and unlocked the kitchen door . There was a soft light coming from the half-open door of our bedroom . I stuck my head into the doorway . " Look who 's here ! " I said , as rakishly as I could . Elsie was asleep , propped up against two big pillows , her long auburn hair spread out around her . A gas lamp was burning on the nightstand . The sound of my voice woke her . " Oh , Paul , " she said , still half asleep . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you feel ? " " I was waiting up , and then I just dozed off , " she said . I made a tiny leap , trying to feature my mustache . " Look who 's here ! " I said . " What time is it ? " Elsie asked , trying to see the little table clock on my side of the bed . " It must be a little past ten , " I said . " How do you feel , Elsie ? " " Is my mother 's light out ? " she asked . There was n't any light coming from the adjoining bedroom . " Yes , it 's out , " I said . Still trying to get Elsie to notice my mustache , I made another little John Barrymore leap in the air and said , " Look who 's here , Elsie . " " Paul , if you 're going to eat something , please hurry . " " I 'm not hungry , Elsie . " " You must be starving , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honestly , I 'm not hungry . How do you feel ? " " If you cared how I felt , would you have left me tonight ? " " Well . . . I did care , even though I left , so the answer must be Yes . ' You look so pretty with your hair that way . " " I do n't feel pretty . " " Is n't life funny , because you do look so pretty ? " " Thank you . " I walked up and sat beside her on the bed . " I brought you something , sweetheart . " " You did n't bring me another pastry ? " she asked . " Oh , Paul , why do you do that ? " " It must be love , " I said , taking her hand . " You 've still got makeup all over your face . Did you know that ? " " I must have forgotten-I was so excited after the play , and I wanted to get home before you went to sleep . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers and underwear and socks , leaving on my shirt . I turned down the lamp and got into bed . " Do n't touch me like that , Paul . " " Why ? " " I do n't feel like it , " she said . " Why ? " Elsie turned away . I lay next to her for a while , until I finally fell asleep . The next morning I was punching tickets on the ride back to Milwaukee . The car was stuffed with soldiers and their girlfriends or wives . Mostly girlfriends , I think . Standing or seated , all the couples seemed to be kissing . A few of the older men and women were trying not to look . As I walked down the aisle my attention was caught by a passenger 's newspaper .
