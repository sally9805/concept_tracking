The first time Kanye West asked the folks at Roc-A-Fella records to let him rap , there was an uncomfortable silence . As a producer , West had churned out hits for Roc-A-Fella 's intimidating trio of stars  --  Jay-Z , Cam'ron and Beanie Siegel  --  and earned praise for his great ear and tireless ethic . But in 2002 the idea that someone like West could be a successful rapper was faintly absurd . " Kanye wore a pink shirt with the collar sticking up and Gucci loafers , " recalls Damon Dash , then Roc-A-Fella CEO . " It was obvious we were not from the same place or cut from the same cloth . " Says Jay-Z : " We all grew up street guys who had to do whatever we had to do to get by . Then there 's Kanye , who to my knowledge has never hustled a day in his life . I did n't see how it could work . " <P> Roc-A-Fella was n't the only label to pass on Kanye ( pronounced Kahn-yay ; it means " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record companies large and small failed to reconcile West 's appearance and demeanor with their expectations of what a rapper should be . They had no idea how to market him . " It was a strike against me that I did n't wear baggy jeans and jerseys and that I never hustled , never sold drugs , " says West , 28 , who grew up in suburban Chicago and often dresses as if he 's anticipating an acceptance letter from Exeter . " But for me to have the opportunity to stand in front of a bunch of executives and present myself , I had to hustle in my own way . I ca n't tell you how frustrating it was that they did n't get that . No joke  --  I 'd leave meetings crying all the time . " <P> When West finally got a deal ( in the end , Roc-A-Fella overcame its institutional bias against Polo shirts ) , he shattered the myth that he was too soft , too weird and too bourgeois to fit the mold of a platinum-selling rapper . His 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platinum , topped all the major critics ' polls , earned 10 Grammy nominations and made rap accessible to audiences that had n't paid attention in years . " That record restored my faith in hip-hop , " says Jamie Foxx , who lent comic vocals to West 's No. 1 hit Slow Jamz . <P> West is hardly the first person to bring a Buppie sensibility to rap . In the ' 80s , DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince , A Tribe Called Quest and LL Cool J successfully wove suburban perspectives into rebellious music , but when gangsta rap arrived , nuance was smothered by a blanket of extreme poses . Tupac Shakur , once a student at the Baltimore School for the Arts , died with THUG LIFE tattooed across his torso . On The College Dropout , West found a way to bridge the divide without self-destruction . His follow-up , Late Registration , arrives Aug. 30 and continues to mix race and class with beats and melodies . It is widely expected to be the biggest-selling record of the year  --  1.6 million copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release .
