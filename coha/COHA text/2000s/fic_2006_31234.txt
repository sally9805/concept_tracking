Henry Meloux , the old Ojibwe Mide , might tell the story this way . He might begin by saying that the earth is alive , that all things on it  --  water , air , plants , rocks , even dead trees  --  have spirit . In the absence of wind , the grass still trembles . On days when the clouds are dense as gray wool , flowers still understand how to track the sun . Trees , when they bend , whisper to one another . In such a community of spirits , nothing goes unnoticed . Would not the forest , therefore , know that a child is about to die ? She is fourteen years , nine months , twenty-seven days old . She has never had a period , never had a boyfriend , never even had a real date . She has never eaten in a restaurant more formal than McDonald 's . She has never seen a city larger than Marquette , Michigan . She can not remember a night when she was n't awakened by nightmares , some dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she was happy , although she has always been hopeful that she might find happiness , discover it like a diamond in the dust at her feet . Through all the horror of her life , she has , miraculously , held to that hope . Until now . Now , though she is only fourteen , she is about to die . And she knows it . Somewhere among the trees below her , the man she calls Scorpio is coming for her . She cringes behind a pile of brush in the middle of a clear-cut hillside studded with stumps like gravestones . The morning sun has just climbed above the tops of the poplar trees that outline the clearing . The chill bite of autumn is in the air . From where she crouches high on the hill , she can see the gleam of Lake Superior miles to the north . The great inland sea beckons , and she imagines sailing away on all that empty blue , alone on a boat taking her toward a place where someone waits for her and worries , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before fleeing , she grabbed a thin brown blanket , which she wrapped around her shoulders . Her feet are bare , gone numb in the long , cold night . They bleed , wounded during her flight through the woods , but she no longer feels any pain . They 've become stones at the end of her ankles . In the trees far below , a dog barks , cracking the morning calm . The girl focuses on a place two hundred yards distant where , half an hour earlier , she 'd emerged from the forest and started to climb the logged-over hillside . An hour after dawn , Scorpio 's dog had begun baying . When she heard the hungry sound , she knew he 'd got hold of her scent . What little hope she 'd held to melted instantly . After that , it was a frantic run trying to stay ahead . Scorpio steps from the shadow of the trees . He 's like a whip , thin and cruel and electric in the sunlight . She can see the glint off the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and tan German shepherd , pads before him , nose to the earth , tracking her through the graveyard of stumps . Scorpio scans the hillside above . She thinks she can see him smile , a gash of white . There is no sense in hiding now . In a few minutes , Scorpio will be on her . Grasshopper quick , she pops from the blind of brush and sprints toward the hilltop . Her senseless feet thud against the hard earth . She lets the blanket fall to the ground , leaves it behind her . Starved for sunlight , the skin of her face and arms looks bleached . Beneath her thin , dirty T-shirt her breasts are barely formed , but the small , fleshy mounds rise and fall dramatically as she sucks air in desperate gasps . Behind her , the dog begins a furious barking . He has seen the prey . She crests the hill and comes to a dead end . Before her the ground falls away , a sheer drop two hundred feet to a river that 's a rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place left to run . She casts a frenzied eye back . Scorpio lopes toward her with Snatch in the lead . To her left and right , there is only the ragged lip of the cut across the hill . Only one way for her to go now : down . The face of the cliff below is a rugged profile offering handholds and small ledges . There are also tufts of brush that cling tenaciously to the stone , rooted in tiny fissures . She spies a shelf ten feet below , barely wider than her foot , but it is enough . She kneels and lowers herself over the edge . Clinging to the brush and the rough knobs of stone that punctuate the cliff , she begins her descent . The rock scrapes her skin , leaves her arms bleeding . Her toes stretch for a foothold but , numbed , feel almost nothing . Weakened by an ordeal that has gone on longer than she can remember , her strength threatens to fail her , but she does not give up . She has never given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has always faced it and pushed ahead . This moment is no different . She wills a place to stand . Her feet find support , a few inches of flat rock on which she eases herself down . " Come on , sweet thing . Come on back up . " Scorpio 's voice is reasonable , almost comforting . She lifts her face . He 's smiling , bone-white teeth between thin , bloodless lips . Beside him , the dog snarls and snaps , foam dripping from his purple gums . " Hush ! " Scorpio orders . " Sit . " Snatch obeys . " Come on , now . Time to end this foolishness . " He lays down his rifle , bends low , and offers his hand . In the quiet while she considers , she presses herself to the cliff where the stone still holds the cold of night . She can hear far below the hiss and roiling of the white water . " We 'll go back to the cabin , " Scorpio says . " Have a little breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sound better than running over these woods , ruining those pretty little feet , freezing your ass off ? " He bends lower . His outstretched hand pushes nearer , a hand that has offered only humiliation and pain . On his wrist is a tattoo , a large black scorpion , the reason for the name she has given him in her thinking . She eyes his hairy knuckles , then looks into his face , which at the moment appears deceptively human . " Think about it . You find a place to perch on that cliff , then what ? It 's not so bad out here right now . Sun 's up , air 's calm . But tonight it 'll be close to freezing . That means you , too . You want to freeze to death ? Hell , it does n't matter anyway . I 'll just leave old Snatch here to make sure you do n't climb back up , go get me some rope , and come down there to get you . But I guarantee if I have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So what do you say ? " Not taking her eyes off him , she seeks a foothold farther down , somewhere out of his reach , but she can not feel her toes . Finally , she risks a glance below her . In that instant , Scorpio 's hand locks around her wrist . " Got you . " He 's strong , his grip powerful . He drags her kicking up the face of the rock . She struggles , screams as he wraps his arms around her . The dog dances back from the edge , barking crazily . Scorpio 's breath smells of tobacco and coffee , but there 's another smell coming off him , familiar and revolting . The musk odor of his sex . " Oh , little darling , " he croons , " am I going to make you pay . " She puts all her desperation , all her remaining strength , into one last effort , a violent twist that breaks her loose , sends her tumbling backward over the cliff . The world spins . First there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky again . She closes her eyes and spreads her arms . Suddenly she is n't falling but flying . The wind streams across her skin . Her held breath fills her like a smooth balloon . She is weightless . For one glorious moment in her short , unhappy life , she is absolutely free . * * * Meloux would finish gently , pointing out , perhaps , that the fall of the smallest robin is known to the spirits of the earth , that no death goes unnoticed or unmourned , that the river has simply been waiting , and like a mother she has opened wide her arms .
