Chapter One Thursday Dear Diary , I 'm so psyched ! Ashley and I have been at Camp Rock ' n ' Roll for two whole weeks . And here 's the best part : We have two whole weeks left to go . Camp Rock ' n ' Roll is an all-girls camp in Pennsylvania . We 're here to learn all about putting together a rock band . I 've already made really cool friends  --  friends like Lark Maitland . Lark and I share all kinds of things : Bunk Elvis , for instance ( all the bunks are named after rock stars )  --  and a serious love of soccer ! Today , before we headed over to the camp barbecue , Lark and I worked up an appetite on the soccer field . She has an awesome kick . " Wow , " I said as I watched her ball disappear over the trees . " Where do you think it landed ? " Lark asked , shading her brown eyes with her hand . " Probably on the barbecue grill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizzle . " " Omigosh ! The barbecue ! " Lark exclaimed . " What if they already ran out of watermelon ? " " That would be the pits , " I joked . We ran to the barbecue so fast , Lark 's long dark hair bounced on her shoulders . Halfway there , she stopped . " I almost forgot , " she said . " I have something for you . " She held up her arm to show me the studded leather bracelet I 'd given her . " You made me a friendship bracelet in arts and crafts , " she said . " So I made you one , too ! " She reached into the pocket of her jeans , then dropped a bracelet with silver and turquoise beads into my hand . " It 's awesome ! " I said . I slipped the bracelet on my wrist . " Thanks , Lark . " It 's still hard to believe that Lark and I are friends . I 've never known anyone who was rock royalty before . Lark 's dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge mansion in England and a gazillion platinum records . But Lark is totally down-to-earth . We have tons of stuff in common . We both love sports , soggy cornflakes , and wearing sneakers all the time . At the barbecue , Lark and I joined my sister , Ashley , and our other bunk mate , Janelle Chow , on the grass . Janelle 's spiky black hair was stuffed into a backward baseball cap . She looked totally metal in her black shirt and studded bracelets . The only thing missing was her electric guitar . " Hamburger , " Janelle mumbled as she stared at her paper plate . " Hot dog ... root beer ... coleslaw ... I stared at Janelle . Why was she acting so weird ? " Potato salad , " Janelle kept mumbling . " Lemonade ... barbecue sauce ... " " Janelle , what are you doing ? " I finally asked . " I was just thinking up more names for our band , " Janelle said . " How about the Dill Pickles ? " Everyone at Camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lark sings and plays tambourine . Ashley and Janelle play electric guitar . I play a mean set of drums  --  well , more like four jumbo tin cans , three upside-down pails , and two aluminum buckets . My drums may look funky , but once I get the beatwatch out ! Janelle , Lark , and I are in a band we 've been calling Crush . But before that it was The Diva Dollz , Xtreme  --  even Atomic Pizza ! " You guys change your band name more than most people change their socks ! " Ashley joked . " Let 's stick with Crush , Janelle , " I said . " The Dill Pickles ' sounds like some cartoon show . " " Fine with me , " Janelle said . She picked up a corncob . " Now I can concentrate on the Battle of the Bands ! " The Battle of the Bands is the highlight of camp . The contest includes four different categories : harmony , vocals , choreography , and songwriting ... Continues ...      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
