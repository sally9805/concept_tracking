<p> Lorne Hirsch remembers the day he paid $150 for a tackle box at a yard sale . He wanted one old lure from the stuff . Under it all , he found a folding hunting knife made by Marbles Arms Company in Gladstone , Mich. , at the turn of the century . <p> " I sold it on eBay , " the California collector said . It moved up to $1,300 . Then in the last 60 seconds , it sold for $2,350 . " <p> His story shows how the romance of seeking sporting collectibles is colliding with the modern world of the Internet and eBay . <p> The Internet helps to dispose of the things you do n't want to collect , " Hirsch said . <p> It also has turned collecting into a worldwide phenomenon . <p> I have a love/hate relationship with eBay , " Hirsch said . It maximizes the market . On the negative , it keeps things from the shows and shops . " <p> You go in the antique malls now , and they are selling on eBay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the president of the National Fishing Lure Collectors Club . It has destroyed the whole anticipation of walking around and finding something . " <p> There were plenty of fanciful collections when the NFLCC held its annual show last week at the Peoria Civic Center . The non-profit club was founded in 1974 . About 2,000 of its 5,000 members came to the show . <p> The romance of collecting drew in most . <p> It 's like fishing  --  you do n't know what or how big a fish you will get , " said Hirsch , who makes the annual show a three-week treasure hunt . <p> We come over the Rockies and hit every antique mall and shop from Denver east in every city , " Hirsch said . We used to sleep overnight in some parking lots . " <p> That 's a week driving to the show , a week at the show and a week driving home . <p> You go up and down the aisles and do n't know what you will find , " Hirsch said . Everybody is looking for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector . Some focus on one color of one lure , others on one company or lure maker and others collect on whims . <p> Gibson has a fairly typical story . The 57-year-old from Nashville , Tenn. , is retired from management with Delta Airlines . His grandfather and buddies started him on the collecting trail . <p> I was a closet collector for five or six years , " said Gibson , who has been collecting for more than 20 years . I fished the early B.A.S.S . tournaments , then really got into collecting . " <p> He focuses on wooden , black Jitterbug muskie lures . <p> Growing up , he fished deep mountain lakes in the Great Smokies for huge largemouth bass at night . The technique was casting the black Jitterbug , a topwater lure , parallel to shore . <p> When the fish hit it , it sounded like the dam broke , " Gibson said . The guy in the back would paddle until the guy in the front caught a fish . " <p> His favorite collectible is a muskie Jitterbug with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never listed in a catalog , was made for muskie fishermen who fished at night . <p> Some collecting is more universal . Enough collect old reels that the Old Reel Collectors Association was formed within the NFLCC . Iowa collector Andy Foster is president . <p> He would not allow photographs of his rarer reels . Why ? At a certain level of collecting , the big players are known . And somebody who desperately wants , say , the first Shakespeare rubber reel will come begging . <p> Just touching Foster 's reels is a treat . To turn a 100-year-old reel soundlessly is something else . Or to see how winding reels evolved . <p> Frank Koffend of A-Lure in Neenah , Wis. , has seen a mighty evolution in his collecting the last 45 years . <p> Initially , I said I would never spend more than $5 for a lure , " he said . <p> That figure is long gone . While there are plenty of reasonable antique or collectible lures left , the top end keeps expanding . The top is the $101,200 paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1859 , at Lang 's Sporting Collectibles fall auction in 2003 . <p> Interests evolve , too . <p> I am always looking for something different , " Koffend said . <p> He owns a very eclectic collection . He has the Howard Hughes dinghy from the Spruce Goose and vintage 2.5-horse Johnson sausage motors . <p> I like novelties like seasickness tins or cherry English fishing reels , " he said . <p> He simply collects wonderful stuff . <p> The best part of collecting is not just the knowledge , not just building a collection , but the longtime , lifetime friends you make , " Gibson said . That is the big sale . " <p> Even in the Internet age , the human touch is the best closer . <p> Bowman can be reached at dale@DaleBowman.com .

Every day there are about 50,000 fishing products . There 's still a vibrant vintage section , about 10,000 . The real bulk , rods and reels are the driver of the category . " <p> Boats are sold every day , too . Fishing products quickly climbed to No. 3 on the sporting side of eBay , trailing only golf and cycling . <p> For beginners , Marich offered these recommendations . <p> As a buyer , look at a seller 's feedback rating , " he said . Beyond that , take a look at the listing . A typical listing has plenty of photos . " <p> Ask questions . Know what the product is .
