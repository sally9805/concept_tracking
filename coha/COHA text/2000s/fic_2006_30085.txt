A Simple Gift By Karyn Witmer Random House Karyn Witmer Avery Montgomery 's life changed in the checkout line at the Food-4-Less , right between the Bounty paper towels and the Heifitz hamburger dills . " You got coupons , Avery , honey ? " the checker asked . Avery flashed the woman a smile and dug into the side pocket of her purse . She 'd gone to high school with Loretta McGee ; Loretta Polk she 'd been then . They were awarded their diplomas at Larkin High two students apartParrish , Pettigrew , Pignoli , Polk . Loretta had been so pregnant that afternoon not even her graduation gown had been able to camouflage her condition , and she 'd been married to Sam McGee before most of the senior class had recovered from their graduation-party hangovers . Avery handed Loretta a fistful of coupons and glanced past the woman 's care-weathered features to the people lined up at the next checkout . A burly man in a red plaid shirt jammed change into the pocket of his jeans and grabbed up the twelve-pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the second-half kickoff . As he turned toward the door , Avery caught sight of the checker at the next register . She was new to the Food-4-Less , sharp-featured and bony in the way kids consider provocative these days . With her bird 's nest of raspberry-purple hair and the silver studs inching up the curve of her ear like a metallic centipede , she was n't the type of girl Gill Matheson usually hired . Then , as the new checker turned to greet her next customer , her gaze caughtand heldAvery 's own . In that instant , a shock of recognition thundered through Avery . The air in her lungs went vaporous and thin . Cold doused her . A maelstrom howled in Avery 's head , as years of cherished memories swirled past her eyes . Instinctively she reached back , seeking her husband 's hand . Mike was there , just like always , clasping her fingers in his own , pressing his thorny thumb into the hollow of her palm . Holding her together . " It'sit 's her ! " Avery whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FionaFee who 'd run off eighteen months before to tour with Jared Hightower 's rock band . Deep inside , the fragile vessel where Avery had stored up every dram of her anguish and fear for her daughter abruptly burst . Thick , sweet relief spilled through her chest and belly . Fiona was here . Fiona was safe . Fiona was home . Then , Fee shifted her gaze to her next customer . Without the intensity of that contact , Avery wavered , then felt her husband steady her . Every morning since her daughter ran away , Avery had risen from sleep with a hot , nameless dread squirming in her chest . For an instant she could n't remember why that was , then she 'd see Fee 's photograph on her nightstand , and it gave that dread a name . It gave it substance and form and urgency . It stirred up grief that lay like a burden on her heart , a weight she carried around with her no matter what she did or where she went . Avery had spent every day since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for one of her daughter 's infrequent e-mails to arrive . Every night she 'd scurry back to the house where she and Mike and Fee had lived together , open the door hopingthen stand staggered by the emptiness . Not once in all those months had Avery closed her eyes at night without wondering where Fiona was and if she was well and safe . It 's going to be all right now , Avery told herself . Now that Fee was back in Larkin , Avery would find a way to make it right . She drew herself up tall and fought to find her balance . She needed to go to her daughter , clasp her hands around those bony shoulders , and smooth that haystack hair . She needed to kiss her daughter 's cheek and seek the child she 'd lost in the body of this stranger . Avery stepped forward , meaning to greet Fee , to hold her safe in her arms , but Mike tightened his grip on her hand . " You do n't mean to confront her here , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not with half the town watching to see what happens . " Before Avery could think , he turned to Loretta . " I 'll be back to get the groceries later . " Loretta glanced first at Avery , then at Fee . " I 'll have someone put them in the cooler out back . " " Thanks , " Mike said and shifted his grip to Avery 's elbow . He steered her down the checkout lane , propelled her past the row of teenage baggers , and through a clot of abandoned shopping carts . Fiona did n't so much as glance their way , concentrating instead on the queue of Sunday afternoon customers backed up at her register . The door into the parking lot whooshed open before them . The toes of Mike 's work boots nudged the heels of Avery 's pumps as he urged her through . He bustled her down the ramp and across the blacktop to where his midnight- blue Silverado was parked . Any other time , Avery would have resisted , but she was too shaken by seeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to pull out of Mike 's grasp . Over the years she 'd trusted Mike to do what he thought was best for her , to do what he thought was best for all of them . So she let him hand her into the cab of the truck . She waited for him to stride around to the driver 's side . He had barely slammed the door behind him , when she burst out , " That was Fiona , was n't it ? " She was almost afraid to believe what she 'd seen , to believe that the terrible months of anxiety were over . " Yes , " Mike confirmed . " After all this time , " she wanted to know , " how could she just turn up here ? Right in the middle of the grocery store ? " " I do n't know , sweetheart . " Avery looked up in to her husband 's angular , sun-browned face and tried to gauge his reaction to unexpectedly encountering their daughter . " Where do you suppose she 's been all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why did she decide to come back to Larkin now ? " Mike reached out and took her hand . " She has to have been in town for at least a little while , " Avery went on , reasoning aloud . " Prime jobs like checking at the Food-4-Less get filled the minute the kids come back to college . " " I suppose . " Mike 's deep , sure voice steadied her , just the way it always did . She stared past him out the window and tried to think . " Where do you think she 's been staying ? " " With Casey ? " he guessed . Casey DeCristo had been Fiona 's best friend ever since the day her daughter had been summarily promoted from second to fourth grade . She 'd arrived in Mrs. Lapp 's classroom a scrawny , fierce-eyed seven-year-old . Fee had already figured out that being smarter than everyone else made you a freak and wanted her classmates to know she was n't going to let them bully her . But that first day at recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-possessed ten , had gone out of her way to befriend the younger girl . That simple kindness had forged a friendship that was going to last all their lives . Since then , the two girls had ridden bikes together , tried out for school plays together , " eewed " through dissections in biology class together . They 'd had sleepovers at each other 's houses , baked countless pans of butterscotch brownies , and gone off to band camp arm in arm . Fee and Casey had shared clothes and worries and girlish secrets . Then , in the middle of their junior year of high school , Casey had met and fallen in love with Dan DeCristo . From that day on , she and Fee had set about making very different lives for themselvesbut their friendship had never wavered . Avery nodded in agreement with her husband . " If Fee is back in Larkin , she 'd be staying in that tiny little house of Casey and Dan 's . " The tiny little house mere blocks from where Fee had grown up , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mike ! " Knowing how close her daughter had been put that quaver back in Avery 's voice . " Why would n't Fee come home to us instead ? Why did n't she even let us know she was back in Larkin ? " Her husband slid an arm around her shoulders and pulled her toward him across the seat . He wrapped her against him , drawing her close . She nestled into the hard breadth of that workingman 's body , breathed the tang of freshly sawed wood that was so much a part of who he was , and closed her eyes against the sting of tears . He stroked his hand the length of her ruddy-brown braid , feathered kisses against the faint crease that had formed between her brows . He hugged her close , and Avery indulged herself in the comfort she 'd always found in her husband 's strength . " Fee 's always insisted on having things her own way , " he murmured . As if that explained why Fiona had kept her return to Larkin a secret , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even as mildly as he 'd spoken , Avery heard the edge in his voice . Because Fee had always been her daddy 's girl , Mike had been angry and deeply hurt by the way she left . " If she wanted us to know she was back , " he went on , " she did n't have to guess about where to find us . " After all these months of silence , Avery did n't care what Fiona wanted . She did n't care that Mike was advocating caution in approaching her . Right now Avery knew exactly where her daughter was , and she meant to have a word with Fee before she slipped away again . Avery lifted her head from her husband 's shoulder and looked up into his deep-blue eyes . Her gaze skimmed the angle of his long jaw , touched the sprinkling of gray in his dark hair . " Thank you , " she whispered . She eased out of his arms and reached for the door handle . " What are you doing ? " Mike demanded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fiona . " " You 're going in there and will make a scene " he notched his chin in the direction of the grocery store " that will set the whole town talking ! " Avery turned and looked back at him . " If people know Fiona 's back in Larkin , " she pointed out , " they 're talking already . As fast as word usually gets around , I 'm surprised no one 's seen fit to tell one or the other of us that Fee 's returned . " If Avery had n't been looking at Mike directly , if she had n't known his face as well as she knew her own , she might have missed the faint shift in his expression . She might not have seen the nearly imperceptible tightening at one corner of his mouth , the shadow that crept into his eyes . In that instant , Avery felt the weight of certainty settle over her . " My God ! " she said on a shaky breath . " You knew Fiona was back in Larkin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , she was just too stupid to live . Fiona eased her purple Neon into the parking space behind Dan and Casey DeCristo 's tiny brick house and killed the engine . " Damn it ! " she shouted , pounding her palms on the steering wheel . " Damn it , damn it ! You knew if you came back to live in Larkin you were bound to run into your parents ! " On the drive from California to Kansas , Fiona had brooded over that first meeting for miles on end . What she ought to do , she 'd told herself , was drive directly to her parents ' house and announce that she 'd come home to Larkin in disgrace . But she had n't been brave enough to do that . Fee thought about stopping at the Holding Company on her way into town , the stuffed-animal business her mother had founded when Fee went into kindergarten . Once the women who 'd been doting on Fee since she was five years old had welcomed her back , what choice would her mother have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't had the courage to do that , either , Fee had been considering asking Casey to invite Avery over for coffee . That way , at least , she would have been able to confront her mother for the first time in private . Fiona had n't dared to think what it might be like to confront her father . She wrapped her hands around the steering wheel and shook it hard . Since she 'd made this mess , she should have taken responsibility for arranging the first meeting with her parents . It might not have been comfortable , but at least it would have been on her own terms . Instead she 'd glanced up from her register at the Food-4-Less and found them staring at her from the next checkout . Her heart had leaped so hard against her breastbone Fee thought it might pop the snaps down the front of her scum-green smock . Fee raised her fist to her chest and tried to rub away that lingering tightness . Since her parents almost always shopped at the Food-4-Less in town , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the highway . Yet there they 'd been , right in the middle of the Sunday afternoon rush : her mother , whey- faced and swaying on her feet , and her father , glaring as if he intended to incinerate her on the spot . In that instant , Fee had been shocked not just at the sight of them , but by the new creases that stood out around her mother 's eyes like wrinkles in a bedsheet . The open hostility in her father 's face had forced her back a step , and she wondered if he was more angry with her for what she 'd done , or how it had affected her mother . It 's all my fault , Fee conceded , her conscience jabbing her . She 'd deliberately snatched up the chance to get away , chosen love and adventure over what she realized even then was the wiser choice . Knowing the things she and her parents had said to one another that last night and remembering the way she 'd left , Fee had n't wanted all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother worry and her father . . . God only knows what her father thought . Fiona huffed out a shaky breath and scrubbed at her eyes . She climbed out of the car and darted across the backyard to the DeCristo 's side door . As Fee jerked it open , Casey appeared on the landing trailed by her sturdy two-year-old son . Casey had on a frilly lavender sundress in deference to the lingering mid-September heat and had curled her hair . Guilt prodded Fee hard . She 'd forgotten she promised to baby-sit for Casey and Dan tonight . Now she was late and had wasted their precious time together . " I 'm sorry , " she apologized hastily . " I did n't mean to hold you and Dan up . " " Not a problem , " Casey assured her and gathered Derek up in her arms . Fee followed Casey and her toddler into the hall , then headed directly for the bedroom at the back of the house . It was barely large enough to accommodate the low toddler 's bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continues ... by Karyn Witmer Excerpted by permission .
