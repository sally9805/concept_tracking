<p> It never should have come to this , a day of colliding emotions , a moment as bitter as it is sweet . If only Jerry Reinsdorf were a bigger person , he would have realized long ago the importance of extending an olive branch to Carlton Fisk and making sure today was a grand part of White Sox history . <p> For once in his stubborn life , Uncle Jerry would have compromised his ego for the good of a stumbling franchise and the pride of Sox fans everywhere , all 500 of them . He would have called a meeting with Fisk , deeply apologized for his role in their long-running feud and asked Pudge to accept a job with the team . He would have done just what the Boston Red Sox did last spring , in fact , ending their own acrimony with Fisk by naming him a special assistant to the general manager . <p> But never , ever would Reinsdorf stoop to such a concession , even as Fisk and his wife continue to live a short drive away in Lockport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Fisk 's No. 72 was retired at the ballmall , but it was so uneventful that no one remembers much about it . Reinsdorf was n't even present , at the request of Fisk , who was tired of dealing with the chairman 's minions after so many episodes when he felt mistreated and unappreciated . Such as the day he was released from the team and run out of the game , without a hint , during the 1993 season . And the night he tried to get into the Sox ' clubhouse to see former teammates during the playoffs , only to be turned aside by a security cop . To forge a truce , Reinsdorf would have had to take charge with a heartfelt effort . <p> He did n't even try . <p> Which is why Chicago , on the day of Fisk 's probable election to the Baseball Hall of Fame , is the Second City again . It feels as if Pudge belongs completely to someone else as we sit in the shadows of his legend . That someone is Boston  --  New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who grew up in New Hampshire and embodied a region right down to his flannel shirt . You might say he was destined to enter Cooperstown in a Red Sox cap , knowing the enduring power of his 1975 World Series homer that assured him an icon 's life there . Yet he had sworn off allegiances to the team until the persistent healing efforts of owner John Harrington and GM Dan Duquette . The issue of which Sox cap he would wear at his Hall induction , White or Red , was in limbo in the ' 90s . The team that wanted Fisk more would get him . <p> " I was bitter and angry at both of them , " he said . <p> Boston won without a fight . Consider it another in a series of public-relations errors that imperils the Sox ' viability in Chicago and may yet turn an obsolete ballpark , within 10 years , into the Bears ' next home or the city 's largest sausage factory . <p> " It ended rather poorly , " Fisk said of his row with Reinsdorf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for amending the situation . It was n't a good one when it ended . It was n't a good one a long time before my career was over . " <p> While Fisk awaited the magic phone call , his father also reflected on the Chicago disappointment . " It 's too bad it ended up that way , " Cecil Fisk said Monday from Charlestown , N.H. , where Carlton was a two-sport star in high school . " He had some good years with Chicago . Unfortunately , his relationship with management did n't work out well . I did meet Reinsdorf when Carlton first went there , but I think that 's the only time I ever saw him . Maybe at spring training once , but I never really had the chance to talk to him . " <p> Is it safe to say his son will wear the Red Sox cap ? " I know the New England people would like that , " said the elder Fisk , playing coy like his son , who has rejected interviews this month in fear of jinxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him leave the Red Sox . He has n't said anything to us about the hat . " <p> Put it this way : Chances are better of the White Sox making a World Series than Fisk wearing White Sox headgear . As if reminders are needed , he played 13 seasons and 1,421 games here . He lended critical credibility to the team back when Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn , the reckless Sunshine Boys , were ridiculing Bill Veeck and making enemies . Fisk was the biggest Sox hero of a generation , the heart of the Winning Ugly team , one of the few gate attractions during the nondescript years , a bridge from old Comiskey to the ballmall , an ornery cuss who worshipped the game and commanded reverence from the young . <p> If he was n't the best catcher ever , he was the rock of his craft , the one who belongs on baseball 's Mt . Rushmore , the eyeblack-wearing ironman who played the most games and years at the position and clearly looked the part . So many of those classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you think , in a perfect world , that Chicago would feel central to the Hall of Fame story . <p> But most of his romanticism is attached to the Red Sox Nation now . Said Fisk : " I think you grow , you mature in life . I think every guy , kid and athlete who has grown up in New England fantasizes about playing for the Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park , wearing the Red Sox uniform , and I was fortunate enough to relive that fairy tale . A lot of fairy tales have been told , and in every one of them , there 's a scary part , an unpleasant part , but they all culminate with happy endings . " <p> It was hard not to smile last July when Fisk appeared at Fenway for the All-Star Game . This was his first high-profile appearance in years , and by the end , his cold , crusty exterior had succumbed to tears . He was among nominees for the All-Century Team , and as he stood on the field , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch , thrown out by . . . Ted Williams . It 's amazing the Citgo sign did n't burn out from the excitement surge . <p> Later , Fisk turned to a newer star from Beantown , actor Matt Damon . " When I think of that , I get goosebumps , " he said . Fisk , goosebumps ? Sure enough , he stuck out his forearm and showed Damon the bumps . When you see Fisk that content and joyful , you know he has found his rightful landing place . <p> Of course , he deserves to be in the Hall . He did last year , thwarted only by the rare powerhouse triad of Nolan Ryan , George Brett and Robin Yount . He hit the most home runs by a catcher . He hit one of the most famous homers of all time , which popularized the sport and led to a $ 113,273 payout for the ball at a 1999 auction . He was an 11-time All-Star . He was a slave to the work ethic , surviving until 45 by staying two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft and made sure others did , too , once admonishing a brash rookie named Deion Sanders for not running out a pop . Since then , Sanders has found the Lord and accepted Fisk 's message as a healthy lesson . <p> You wish Pudge would have worn the White Sox cap on the famed steps . It 's a sight rarely seen . More than that , it would have represented the ability of an owner to put history ahead of himself . <p> Sadly , that is n't Uncle Jerry 's style .
