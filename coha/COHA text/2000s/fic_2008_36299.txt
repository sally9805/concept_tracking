PERCHED LIKE A FLAMINGO ON ONE LEG , I TRIED TO BALANCE the groceries on my thigh without disturbing baby Luke , who was sound asleep in his sling . Somehow , I managed to unlock the front door and juggle my way inside without dropping the lemon meringue pie that was teetering perilously on top of the pretzel packages , and I made it into the kitchen without waking Luke or losing hold of either bag . <p> The house still reeked of last night 's beer . Judging by the empties lined up on the kitchen counter , Nick and his brothers had gone through several six-packs . Not that I blamed them , really . It was a family reunion . If not for the baby , I 'd undoubtedly have joined in , drinking my share for no reason other than to avoid being what I had been lately : the only sober adult in the house . Instead of beer , I 'd sipped decaffeinated mint tea , listening to them recount childhood memories , hoot over private jokes , tease each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renditions of their favorite oldies . It had been a long few nights . Actually , a long three nights . Ever since Tuesday , when Tony and Sam had arrived , our house had been home to a non-stop party . <p> Even so , the demands of daily life continued . Food needed to be bought , meals to be cooked . Shoving the empties aside with my elbow to make room for the grocery bags , I noticed a puddle on the floor next to the refrigerator . Damn . Somebody had let the puppy out of his crate again . And , as if on cue , he raced over , jumping and yipping , nipping at my ankles with joy at our return . <p> " Oliver , no , no . " I knelt , cradling the baby 's sling with one hand , shaking a finger at him with the other . " No . Do not piddle in the house . " <p> Oliver , our almost-five-month-old Pembroke Welsh corgi puppy , still was n't housebroken . His training kept getting interrupted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit tended to interfere . The result was that Oliver left surprises for us all over the house . If he was n't leaving deposits , he was chewing on chair legs or shoes , anything he could wrap his mouth around . <p> When I released his nose , Oliver stared at me with shiny , eager eyes , oblivious to the scolding . In fact , he was smiling , tongue dangling , panting with eagerness and delight , waiting attentively for who knew what . I had to admit he was cute . How was I supposed to stay angry with a little guy who grinned at me with such complete adoration ? Sighing , I tightened the wrap that secured Luke to my body and gave Oliver an affectionate scratch before attending to his puddle . <p> As I looked for the paper towels , though , it occurred to me that , oops , I should n't have petted him . The teacher at puppy school had warned about reinforcing bad behavior . What if Oliver connected the puddle with the scratch and thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn . I might be counter-training him . But it was too late to take the scratch back . I 'd have to be more careful from now on or we 'd have an incorrigible corgi , a sociopath , completely indifferent to the concepts of bad and good . Meantime , I had to clean up his puddle . <p> Where were the paper towels ? I hunted , scanning the sink full of breakfast dishes , the still half-full coffeepot , the stack of miscellaneous coupons and carryout menus , eventually spotting the towels behind the knife rack near the phone , which was blinking , the red light flashing , indicating that we had messages . So , grabbing a wad of crumpled paper towels , I multitasked , putting the phone on speaker , dialing our voice mail number and listening as I squatted to attend to the mess , still trying not to awaken Luke . <p> But I was too late ; Luke 's eyes were already open and alert . Any moment , he 'd realize he was hungry ; I had to hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , I soaked up the puddle , still hoping to get the groceries put away before I had to feed him . <p> " You have five messages . " The computerized voice sounded impressed . " First message . " <p> " Zoe , I 'll be back Monday . " It was Ivy , our babysitter , whose car had been stolen earlier in the week while parked right in front of our house . Normally , Ivy walked to work ; she lived only about a mile away . But the one time she 'd driven , her car had vanished in broad daylight . Ivy 's voice now reported that she had spent the entire day doing the paperwork for her car insurance and she was ready to come back to work . From her tone , I could tell that she still blamed me for the theft . Somehow , she 'd figured that since her car had been parked on my street , it was my fault that it was stolen . I 'd been unable to convince her otherwise . Ivy took no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood as well as I did . The crime rate was high in Philadelphia , and it seemed to be higher than average in our neighborhood , Queen Village . The area was in transition , but it was a long way from gentrified . Robberies , muggings , even drive-by shootings were not unheard of . Addicts and drunks frequented the nighttime sidewalks that by day sported upscale perambulators . The street was n't a place you 'd let children play unsupervised . And it was n't a place where you 'd leave your parked car unlocked . But according to Ivy , the person who could n't remember locking her car , the theft of the vehicle , like her presence on the street , was because of me . Ivy was neither logical nor easy to get along with , but Molly liked her and , despite Ivy 's attitudes , I was desperate . I needed her help . It was already Friday , and there were just eight days until the wedding  --  Wait . Stop . I had to repeat that fact . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding . <p> Breathe , I told myself . Just stop and breathe . I closed my eyes and let air rush into my lungs , holding it there for a moment , letting it enter my blood . Then I exhaled slowly . I was on overload , and I had to stop spinning , get organized . But every time I even thought about the w word , my heart did a dizzying break dance and I stopped breathing . Excitement , nerves , joy , panic  --  I did n't know what . It did n't matter , either , because time was passing and there was so much left to do that I had no time for stuff like naming emotions . And , meantime , the lady in the telephone was impatiently repeating that I needed to push 1 to repeat , 2 to save , 3 to delete Ivy 's message . <p> I stood , pushed 3 and tossed the soggy paper towels into the trash , held a soapy rag under hot water and squatted again , simultaneously telling Oliver to stop jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to whimper , awake enough to realize that it was way past time for his every-four-hour meal . I sang him the song about the Puffer Bellies , hoping to distract him for a couple of minutes , long enough for me to at least finish cleaning up the floor . So I washed the tiles , singing , while the puppy chased the soapy rag , chomping and pouncing , trying to grab it , having a wonderful time , and the phone mail voice announced , " Second message . " <p> This one was from Anna , the special event planner from hell . No , that was n't fair . Anna was efficient and detail oriented , persistent and organized ; she was everything I needed her to be . It was n't her fault that her voice was nasal and sharply birdlike , or that the shape of her glasses reminded me of outstretched wings . And I 'd just left her half an hour ago ; what could she possibly need to say that she had n't already said ? It did n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a dozen times a day , always had one more item to discuss . I stopped singing long enough to listen to her say that she wanted to remind me , even though she 'd just reminded me in person , that she needed a final count for the reception dinner . The chef at the Four Seasons required a week 's notice . And Anna needed a decision about whether to go with Amaretto or hazelnut for the cake . I mentally recited the list along with her ; she 'd repeated it so many times , I had it memorized . <p> I stood , pushed number 3 to delete , rinsed out the rag , stooped again and , singing , " See the engine driver pull the little handles , " rushed to wipe up the soap bubbles before the puppy could lick them up . " Puff , puff , toot , toot , off we go ! " Lulled by either my singing or my repeated standing and stooping , Luke quieted down , burbling softly . <p> " Third message , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was calling for Zoe Hayes with a message from Haverford Place about Walter Hayes . Oh dear . Walter Hayes was my eighty-three-year-old father . And Haverford Place was the retirement village where he lived . I froze , rag in hand , staring at the phone , dreading the message , praying he was all right . The soprano insisted that she did n't want to alarm anyone , but she was wondering if , possibly , Ms. Hayes had any idea where her father might be . Because , she did n't mean to worry his family , but no one had seen Mr. Hayes in a while . Actually , since yesterday . In fact , Walter Hayes appeared to be missing . <p> Missing ? I released a breath , relieved ; at least he was alive . As far as we knew , no harm had come to him . All we needed to do was find out where he 'd gone . This was not the first time Dad had taken off on his own . He was stubbornly independent , unwilling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turmoil he caused when he neglected to sign the ledger book before he went out . Probably he 'd gone back to his old neighborhood , stopping by his old house , pulling the " For Sale " sign out of the grass one more time . Or maybe he 'd hopped a bus to Atlantic City for some blackjack . Or gone to Delaware Park to play the horses . He was fine . Probably . <p> But then again , he had n't been seen since yesterday . That was a long time , even for my father . I deleted the message and tossed the rag into a bucket under the sink , ready to call Haverford Place . But before I could , the fourth message began , sounding much like the third but less frantic . The soprano , cheerful now , asked Ms. Hayes to disregard her previous call . The search was off ; my father had reappeared in prime condition , no need for concern . She did n't elaborate , offered no details . But that was fine ; Dad was safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to know . There was no need to hunt for him . <p> Luke began wriggling , his little mouth rooting around for a nipple . " Fifth message . " It was the last one . I whispered to Luke , asking him to wait while we heard this last message , wincing as soon as I recognized the caller 's voice . Bryce Edmond was the administrator of the Psychiatric Institute where I worked , and he 'd been calling all week . In truth , I 'd been avoiding him . <p> " Zoe . " Bryce sounded peeved . " I 've sent you two dozen e-mails and called you eleven times . " Bryce was nothing if not exact . And while he did n't want to disturb me during my maternity leave , he needed to speak with me at my earliest convenience . <p> Damn . Why could n't he leave me alone ? Obviously , Bryce wanted to talk about work . And I did n't . Whatever he had to say was n't going to be good . The Psychiatric Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My program in art therapy was considered by the administration to be " unessential " ; it had already been cut in half . In addition , my three months of maternity leave were just about , if not already , up . So , either Bryce was calling to say that it was time to come back to my job , which I was n't ready to do , or he was calling to say that there was no job for me to come back to , which I was n't ready to hear . Either way , I figured that if he could n't reach me , he could n't deliver his news . So , as I had every time he 'd called , I pushed number 3 , and Bryce was deleted . I told myself not to feel bad about ignoring him . After all , it was just a week until my wedding  --  oops , there was the w word again  --  and there went my heart , taking off in its frenzied , dizzying spin , bouncing off my ribs . So Bryce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't just the wed  --  the upcoming event . I also had to care for a new baby , an energetic six-year-old daughter , Molly , an unhousebroken puppy and a houseful of my soon-to-be-in-laws . I simply could n't be expected to deal with anything else  --  certainly not my job . Whatever was on Bryce 's mind would have to wait until after the w  --  ceremony . <p> I turned off the phone , abandoning the unpacked groceries , assuring Luke that he was finally going to eat . His whimpers had escalated , turned into complaints . Poor baby had been patient all morning , riding around snuggled against my belly , tied to me by a long hand-woven shawl-like sling my friend Karen had given me as a shower gift . He 'd kept me company on this weirdly warm , foggy April day while I 'd shopped and picked up the cleaning . He 'd nuzzled me peacefully while I 'd met with Anna to taste pastries and appetizers for the reception . But now , he was finished being Mr. Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowing as fiercely as his eleven-week-old lungs would allow . And , on command , automatically , my body responded . Milk welled up and spilled from the swollen spigots that were my breasts . <p> " Okay , " I pleaded . " Lunchtime , Luke . Just a second . " Normally , I changed his diaper before feeding him , but he was wailing . The diaper , like the groceries , could wait . I hurried down the hall to the living room , Oliver snapping and nipping at my heels with all of his purebred herding dog instincts . I cooed to Luke , but he was inconsolable . He 'd smelled lunch and , red-faced , tight-fisted , he let his fury rip . <p> Pulling up my sweater , I plopped down onto my purple velvet sofa and popped right up again , tossing an iPod onto the coffee table . Tony , one of Nick 's brothers , had been camping on my sofa . Living on it , actually . Making a tiny home there . I shoved aside an afghan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Luke let loose with a shrill , spine-piercing shriek , sat back down and opened the cup of my nursing bra . Luke lunged , sucking ferociously , and distracted by I did n't care what , the puppy finally released the hem of my jeans . <p> I leaned back , settling in , closing my eyes . Peace at last . I sank against the cushions , felt the soreness in my breasts ease as Luke drank . Breast-feeding was intoxicating . It made me sleepy , maudlin and sappy ; it made thinking about anything but the baby impossible . The world around us dissolved away . All that existed was Luke 's downy head , sweet skin and soft smell , his purring as he nuzzled possessively against me , his sweaty , passionate breathing as he suckled . As always when I nursed him , I floated , lost in hormonal bliss . I felt cozy and brainless , fulfilled , as if my entire reason for being was to provide nourishment for this precious tiny creature . Usually , a full stomach made Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to doze . <p> But peace that Friday was brief . No sooner did I drift off than Oliver began yelping . I cracked an eyelid , saw him digging on the mat by the sliding door to our tiny backyard . Maybe he was asking to go out ? Picking this particular moment to get housebroken ? Amazing . Oh well . He 'd have to wait . I could n't let him out while Luke was nursing . " Easy , Oliver , " I pleaded . " Hold on for a little bit . " <p> I shut my eyes again , determined to reclaim my bliss , hoping Oliver would not leave yet another puddle to mop up . But Oliver kept yipping , scratching at the glass of the sliding door . Maybe there was a squirrel out there . Or a cat . Or a UFO . I did n't care ; I just wanted it to leave so Oliver would quiet down . But he did n't . His high-pitched barks persisted . Finally , I 'd had it . Unable to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oliver , no ! " <p> He stopped barking and looked at me , head tilted , baffled , clearly wondering what was wrong with me . How could I just sit there ? Then he turned back to the door and barked . I followed his gaze , saw no movement . No rodent . No feline . Nothing . And still , he barked . <p> " Oliver , " I commanded , " enough . Shut up . " <p> Deliberately , I leaned back and shut my eyes . If I ignored him , he 'd eventually quiet down . But my mind must have unconsciously registered some abnormal detail , because without knowing why , I sat up and took another , more careful look at the sliding door . And there , on the concrete , on the right side of the glass , I saw something that made no sense . Something that simply could n't be there . Something that looked like five plump , pink toes . <p> Excerpted from The Borrowed and Blue Murders by Merry Jones <p> Copyright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunne Books , St. Martin
