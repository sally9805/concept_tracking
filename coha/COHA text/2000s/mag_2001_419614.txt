Photograph by Peter Brenner . Photograph // How collectors decide on the focus of their collection is often a fascinating process . An interesting case in point is the story of a couple who came to American art after having achieved distinction as collectors of Asian , especially Japanese , art . Their approach to American art was conditioned by what they had learned from Japanese art . First , they had acquired an advanced awareness of two-dimensional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that immediately sets up a tension between what is represented and how it is represented . Thus , for this couple , a painting 's subject does not hold the absolute primacy it does with most collectors . A second quality they had learned through their study and collecting of Japanese art was attentiveness to subtlety , for the goal of all Japanese masters is refinement and nuance . This is different from the expectations of many collectors of American art , who often do not expect to find much beyond the first impact . Yet another distinctive quality that these collectors brought to their collecting was connoisseurship . In collecting Japanese all , they sought the advice of distinguished experts , from whom they could learn not only about their subject but also the skills of perception that mark the connoisseur . I was flattered to be chosen by these collectors as their adviser for American art and to have the opportunity to work with them , observe their approach , and assist with their choices . Their expectations about art inevitably led the collectors to focus on American art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period that itself had felt the influence of Japanese art . Between about 1875 and 1885 the aesthetic movement brought to American decorative and fine art circles a new consciousness of Japanese art , particularly an emphasis on the decoration of surfaces and thus an increased awareness of twodimensional design . Evidence of this influence can be found in the work of artists as important as Winslow Homer ( 1836-1910 ) and George Inness ( 1825-1894 ) in the late 1870s , as well as in the work of many other painters . Coinciding with the influence of the aesthetic movement was a new consciousness of the painted surface among young artists returning to New York from study in Munich and especially Paris in the late 1870s and 1880s . There they had learned to appreciate brilliant technique . Subject matter diminished in interest , while how the subject was painted became paramount . This reversal of the usual interest was seen in the exhibitions of the newly formed Society of American Artists in the late 1870s , to which young artists often sent their preparatory oil sketches for the finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Design . In their sketches they were showing their colleagues how economically or expressively they could paint and how beautifully they manipulated the medium . Thus another point of contact between American art of this period and Japanese art is an intense interest in the way a work is painted . Photograph Pl . II .

As the latters ' sensitivity and influence steadily increased past the turn of the century , artists could take chances on more complicated or more subtle paintings , certain that they would be viewed sympathetically They were likewise supported by avantgarde dealers such as Newman E. Montross ( 1849-1932 ) and William Macbeth ( 18511917 ) , both in New York City , and by a generation of collectors of great sophistication , including William K. Bixby , Thomas B. Clarke , William T Evans , Charles Lang Freer , John Gellatly , and George A Hearn . The artists were , however , painting for a relatively small group of perceptive individuals , and many decades later much of their work still did not have broad appeal . This is where their years of developing a discriminating eye for Japanese art began to pay off for the couple whose collection is featured in this article . For example , they were able to purchase two wonderful paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Early Morning ( Pl . XIII ) , at a time when the artist was of little interest to major dealers . The collectors ' crucial advantage was that they were accustomed to responding to subtlety In Early Morning Tryon used dim light and mist to soften shapes , and he placed one screen of trees in front of two others , further confusing the reading of the landscape . Such layering makes the painting inaccessible to anyone responding to it hastily or superficially . Displayed in a gallery window at street level on Madison Avenue in New York City , Early Morning was by-passed by many glancing American art collectors , but these collectors stopped , studied it , and recognized it for what it was . Like many of their paintings , Early Morning was painted with the expectation that the viewer would take an active part in understanding and enjoying it . To appreciate it , one must spend some time registering the slight variations in the intensity of the several greens that provide the key to the spatial separation of the three screens of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity and texture of the painting also unveils considerable space in the foreground meadow , which initially appears flat and shallow . By this point the patient viewer is also able to see the slight pink that so gently tints the sky and parts of the landscape . Next the viewer senses the warm light filtering through the cool green of the fine foliage in the screen of tallest and nearest trees . More and more content gradually emerges-the light on the distant field , the low wall crossing the painting near the row of tall trees , the bushes by the wall , and the foreground weeds . Most importantly , the viewer begins to experience the paintings very poetic feeling , a delicate , tender , and exquisite feeling that is produced by suggestion and nuance . Their experience with Japanese art had prepared these collectors to take this very active role in appreciating the painting , and , as a result , as one of their first purchases , they had chosen one of the artists finest examples from his best period . Their other work by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every bit as fine , although quite different . When they bought it , it was being sold by the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh , which had originally acquired it for its permanent collection in 1899 as an exceptional example of the advancement of American art . At the low ebb of the artists reputation and in defiance of general taste , the painting was seized by the collectors who were certain they had the opportunity to acquire a major work . Another work that rewards this kind of searching , sensitive viewing is Meditation ( Pl . XV ) , a wonderful pastel portrait by William Merritt Chase of his fiancee , Alice Gerson . To the superficial glance it can appear subdued and simple , and many collectors would probably prefer one of the artists more dramatic interiors or one with showier colors . But the viewer who spends time with the pastel will register the voluptuous and varied textures of several velvets , fur , and flesh , and the precisely tuned range of tonally close , muted colors . Concentrating in this way on the portraits subtleties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beloved young woman . This work must be approached on its own terms and searched for its sensuous richness and the haunting emotional response it produces in the careful viewer . Many collectors of American art , however expect paintings to meet them on their terms and judge a painting by its success in presenting a persuasive and immediately apparent vision of an attractive subject . Very few of the paintings in this collection are so obliging . Some of them , for instance , have quite enigmatic subjects that are meant to engage the imagination . For example , The Fortune Teller , painted by Thomas Wilmer Dewing about 1904 or 1905 ( Pl . III ) , was rapturously admired by the greatest connoisseurs of that day , but it offers little in the way of immediate gratification . Its ostensible subject , one woman using a deck of cards to tell another 's fortune , is only the very beginning of its rich content , and even that apparent subject is compromised by ambiguities . The extreme withdrawal of the figure on the left renders a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the space , the powerful form of the table , pressing one figure into the upper corner , the extreme contrast between the compact passive figure and the open pose of the active one , the palpable atmosphere , the delicate color , and other formal elements all form parts of a larger , more complex content . The tensions and ambiguities that stretch the imagination also engage the viewers feelings in an inexplicable alchemy . In paintings of this kind it is the nature of art to be indirect and poetic , to affect the emotions . Photograph Pl . V Maine Coast , by Emil Carlsen ( 1853-1932 ) , 1914 .

Brenner photograph // Beyond seeking works that require active investigation , the collectors have always looked for paintings the surfaces of which are themselves expressions of exceptional beauty . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in Japanese art , and it was of primary interest to some American artists of the late nineteenth century , among them Abbott Handerson Thayer , who is represented in the collection by a landscape and a portrait . His Portrait of Bessie Price ( Pl . II ) won the Thomas B. Clarke Prize when it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1898 . Its image of the ideal young woman is appealing , even in reproduction , but what can be seen only in the original is the breathtaking brilliance of the brushwork , which makes believable fabrics out of a magical jumble of free unhesitating brushstrokes . Many collectors are oblivious to minor miracles of technique like this , but these two collectors were accustomed to always examining and responding to technique in their Japanese painting , and so they looked for it in their American paintings as well . Skillful , sensuous surfaces are an additional pleasure in almost all the American paintings in their collection . Finally , I would like to bring into sharper focus one unusual asset these collectors brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider how they display and view their large collection of choice Japanese scrolls and screens . Normally , these works are carefully stored away , but when there is an occasion for viewing , individual pieces are brought out one at a time and displayed in a tokonoma , or alcove , alone or often with a flower arrangement . This approach , which anticipates that a special , rare experience will reward the fully focused and informed viewer , was the key element that they transferred from the one area of collecting to the other . They expected that their paintings would be wonderful , and those expectations gave them the courage to reach for the exceptional . The combination of Asian art and American art in this collection calls to mind the celebrated collection of Charles Lang Freer ( 18541919 ) , the founder on the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. Interestingly , he began by collecting American paintings , and indeed owned works by some of the very artists who are prominent in the collection discussed here : Thomas Dewing , Dwight Tryon , Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opposite direction and began collecting the Asian art that so well represented the qualities he admired in his American paintings . It would appear that Asian art and this most poetic aspect of American art are a natural , perhaps inevitable , combination . Most of the paintings in this article are on view in Poetic Painting , an exhibition at Vance Jordan Fine Art in New York City until December 7 .
