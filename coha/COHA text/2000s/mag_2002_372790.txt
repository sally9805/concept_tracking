PLACEBO POWER Move over , Prozac . It looks as if sugar pills can chase the blues away too . A six-week clinical trial in which doctors used PET scans to examine the brains of 17 patients hospitalized for depression shows that high-priced antidepressants and dummy pills both cause visible changes in the mood-regulating regions of the brain . Asked how they felt , patients on fake and real pills alike reported that their symptoms improved . But do n't tear up your prescription just yet . The catch ? The subjects ' moods may have lifted in part because they had left their usual worries behind and moved into a supportive environment . Also , it 's not clear that the effect will last ; placebo effects are notoriously short-lived . Moreover , dummy pills work only if patients believe they are getting the real thing , which does n't usually happen outside a clinical trial . <P> GO ORGANIC Worried that you 're paying a premium for organic food but that it 's chock-full of chemicals anyway ? Well , the first detailed scientific analysis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residue , but far less often than conventional produce does ( 23% vs. 73% of the time ) . And when residues show up , they 're usually in very low concentrations . Why does organic food contain chemicals in any amount ? Pesticides that were banned long ago , like DDT , can hang around in soil for years . <P>  --  By Janice M.
