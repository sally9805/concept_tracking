On April 25 , 1990 , the crew aboard Space Shuttle Discovery deployed the Hubble Space Telescope , seen here floating above the shuttle 's cargo bay . HST reached space six years behind schedule and soon was found to have a defective primary mirror . Optics to sharpen HST 's images at visible , ultraviolet , and near-infrared wavelengths were not delivered to the telescope for nearly four years .

At the front of the room a handful of ashen-faced A managers , engineers , and scientists are facing a barrage of questions from reporters . The NASA officials have just announced that the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope suffers from severe spherical aberration and that the telescope 's performance will be considerably worse than expected . This announcement provoked consternation and anger from Capitol Hill - one senator called the telescope a " technoturkey " - as well as ridicule from late-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . Some astronomers even worried that NASA and Congress might be tempted to cut their losses and end the telescope 's mission before it had started . Yet even a hobbled Hubble was capable of some first-rate science . It quickly helped set an upper limit to the coontribution of faint red stars to the darkmatter component of our Milky Way galaxy and shed new light on quasar absorption lines , for example . But overall this was not the quality of science for which NASA and the European Space Agency had paid $2 billion . It was only after an imaginative technical " fix , " together with a brilliantly successful repair mission by Space Shuttle astronauts in December 1993 , that HST 's reputation truly began to be remade . Photograph // The telescope , in fact , was swiftly transformed into a public symbol of scientific and technical prowess . Indeed , from the vantage of early 2000 and 10 years of performance in orbit - that is , halfway through its currently planned lifetime - it 's possible to start to address how the science secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before launch . Of course , the initial expectations were so very high because HST would be the first large optical telescope to obtain images at the theoretical diffraction limit . Thus HST promised angular resolution an order of magnitude better than can generally be obtained through the Earth 's atmosphere . A further consequence is that the sky background failing on each resolution element of an image is reduced by an enormous factor , so images have unparalleled contrast . In addition , by getting above the obscuring layers of the Earth 's atmosphere , the range of wavelengths available to HST is greater than for ground-based optical telescopes . HST has a long history and was first discussed in detail among astronomers in the late 1960s . Its planned capabilities led to rapidly growing interest in the early 1970s . These were also the years when the fine points of some of the scientific problems the telescope might tackle were first worked out in some specificity . The Solar System Even in the very early planning it was widely assumed that the telescope 's biggest contributions would lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescope would be extremely valuable for examining astronomical targets much closer to home , including long-term monitoring of planetary atmospheres . For example , in 1974 , four years before construction of the telescope began , the prominent astronomer Harlan Smith addressed a major meeting on " Solar System Astronomy from the LST . " ( Until 1975 the planned telescope was called the Large Space Telescope , LST , intended to have a 3-meter primary mirror ; it then became the 2.4-meter Space Telescope before being renamed the Hubble Space Telescope in 1982 . ) At a time before the Voyager missions to the outer solar system , Smith worried that " Uranus and Neptune may not have detectable features at any wavelength . " HST in fact has been very successful in observing cloud motions on both Uranus and Neptune . In June 1994 , for instance , its observations indicated that a great dark spot in the cloudy atmosphere of Neptune - first seen by Voyager 2 during its 1989 flyby of the planet - had disappeared . However , shortly afterward a new , great dark spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter were interpreted as atmospheric gases flowing over the spot and colliding to form clouds of methane-ice crystals . The atmosphere of Uranus - the blandest of the outer planets when Voyager 2 swept by in 1986 - has also been scrutinized by HST From observations made between 1994 and 1998 astronomers have detected seasonal changes on the planet and secured highly persuasive evidence that Uranus experiences storms similar to those seen on the other gas giants . Photograph One of the principal justifications for building HST was to determine the distance scale of the universe through observations of Cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies . This HST image of NGC 4603 , one of the farthest in which Cepheids have been detected , revealed three or four dozen of these stars that indicate this Centaurus splendor is 108 million light-years away . Note the blue starforming regions that outline NGC 4603 's spiral arms . // But perhaps the most spectacular planetary-astronomy role for HST was an unexpected one , the monitoring of the fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 as they sped toward and then smashed into Jupiter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these events and was able to resolve features as small as 320 kilometers across . One problem often discussed in connection with LST , ST , and then HST , in both scientific and public forums , was the possible detection of extrasolar planets , usually by direct imaging or astrometry ( that is , searching for the " wobble " of the parent star ) . This problem was generally seen as a hard one for HST to crack , but a positive result would be so exciting that any effort was well worth it . To date , there is no strong evidence that HST has found an extrasolar planet . Star Formation and Stellar Evolution Summarizing a conference held in 1979 to debate what science should be done with HST , James Gunn , then of Hale Observatories , reckoned that " star formation , the interstellar medium , and gravitation together make galaxies , and it is in the high resolution study of their component parts that HST will make significant advances . " Not only have HST 's studies of star formation spawned many tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most remarkable images . Indeed , perhaps the most famous of all to date is that of newborn stars emerging from EGGs ( evaporating gaseous globules ) in the Eagle Nebula , M16 . HST also has helped to establish that protoplanetary disks are relatively common and has provided direct evidence - described as " one of the great surprises of the Hubble Space Telescope " - for dusty disks around low-mass stars in the vicinity of the Orion Nebula . Furthermore , it yielded direct evidence for the theoretically expected jets that emanate perpendicular to an accretion disk around a newly forming star . // HST 's Legacy at a Glance Photograph Fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 caused dusky blotches in Jupiter 's atmosphere.The conspicuous left-hand smear is due to overlapping impacts from fragments D and G ( fourth and seventh from left in the comet image ) , and the right-hand one is from fragment L ( tenth ) . HST recorded the comet in January 1994 , about six months before it imaged the impacts . // HST has also made very major contributions to the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numerous planetary nebulae have been observed by HST The telescope has recorded an astonishing variety of intricate and often bizarre shapes , challenging astronomers to explain the hydrodynamic effects involved in the interactions between the planetary nebula and the surrounding medium . The supernova that exploded violently in the Large Magellanic Cloud in 1987 was quickly examined by a battery of telescopes on Earth and in space . But later FIST images of SN 1987A - the brightest supernova visible from Earth since Kepler 's Star of 1604 - revealed more detail , and the telescope has been able to track changes at the sub-lightyear scale . The remarkable set of rings it has recorded has so far defied an explanation that has drawn a broad consensus . Perhaps the images show hot , fastmoving gas , blown off in the supernova explosion , colliding with slower-moving , cooler , and denser gas ejected from the star some 20,000 years ago . Supermassive Black Holes Another of those to attend the 1979 symposium to address the scientific research to be conducted by HST was Wallace Sargent of Hale Observatories . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuclei of Seyfert galaxies , quasars , BL Lacertae objects ( blazars ) , and X-ray galaxies are all powered ultimately by collapsed objects at their centers . At that time , the most widely , but not universally , held view was that the central engine in active galaxies and QSOs was driven by the accretion of stars or gas onto a supermassive black hole . But in Sargent 's opinion the " history of the study of active galaxies and QSOs has been marked by an enormous gap between theory and observation . It is one of the prime tasks of the Space Telescope to close this gap . " In fact , two years earlier Sargent , Peter J. Young , and their collaborators had argued in two seminal papers that a **26;1878;TOOLONG black hole sits in the center of M87 , the famous elliptical galaxy some 50 million light-years away in the Virgo Cluster . Later , other astronomers using ground-based telescopes found evidence for supermassive black holes in other galaxies . HST has been exploited extensively to examine the centers of numerous relatively nearby galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for supermassive black holes at the centers of many of them . For example , the team of astronomers associated with the Faint Object Spectrograph ( FOS ) , one of HST 's original complement of scientific instruments , studied the environment very close to M87 's core using its spectrograph as well as the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 . ( The latter was installed during the 1993 servicing mission . ) With this camera they found a gas disk in the center of M87 - a surprise in itself for an elliptical galaxy - that is nearly perpendicular to the galaxy 's famous one-sided jet , and with the FOS they measured the speed of orbiting gas on either side of the disk . They decided that their observations could be explained by the presence of more than 2 billion solar masses in a region at most 120 light-years across . For the team of astronomers involved , here was absolutely clear-cut evidence that a supermassive black hole was present at the very heart of M87 . Quasars From the very early days of quasar astronomy ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one body of astronomers has maintained that quasars are sited in galaxies , probably in their nuclei . Not only are quasars very distant ( so that the host galaxies would be expected to be extremely dim ) but their prodigious light output adds greatly to the difficulty of detecting the underlying host . In early 1973 Jerome Kristian , an astronomer at Palomar Observatory and later a member of the Wide Field/Planetary Camera team , argued that halos should be detectable around images of the closest quasars , and indeed he found " fuzz " around some with correspondingly low redshifts . Photograph Taken by HST in June 1994 , this pair of almost true-color images reveals Neptune 's atmospheric features on opposite hemispheres . Although the planet 's disk was only 2.3 arcseconds in diameter , the bright , high-altitude , methane-ice clouds discussed in the text on page 29 are evident .

The builders of ESAs Faint Object Camera ( FOC ) , one of the telescope 's first complement of instruments , designed it with quasars very much in mind . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one aim of which was to block the light of quasars so as to make visible the surrounding hosts . But following the discovery of spherical aberration and the subsequent " fix " ( one consequence of which was to reduce the field of view of the FOC ) , the original FOC team and another team of astronomers searching for the host galaxies of quasars employed the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 in their hunt . The results were surprising indeed and went beyond what had been done from the ground . Although there were some differences in their findings , the two teams could agree that : 1 . Most of the quasars examined were found to lie at the cores of luminous galaxies. 2 . It was expected before the HST observations that " radio-loud " quasars were to be found in ellipticals and " radioquiet " ones in spirals . Indeed , quasars with the strongest radio signals were associated primarily with elliptical galaxies , but some of the radio-quiet quasars were found to live in ellipticals too . 3 . Many , but not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other galaxies . ( This already had been determined using adaptive optics with a groundbased telescope , but HST 's evidence was more clear-cut . ) The leader of one of the two teams was John Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey , one of the key figures in winning support for the telescope in the 1970s and planning for its use in the 1980s . In discussing these results in 1996 , he said , " If we thought we had a complete theory of quasars before , now we know we do n't . No coherent , single pattern of quasar behavior emerges . The basic assumption was that there was only one kind of host galaxy , or catastrophic event , which feeds a quasar . In reality we do n't have a simple picture - we have a mess . " The Deep Field In December 1995 HST spent 10 days pointed toward a patch of sky some 2.7 arcminutes on a side , or about a tenth the diameter of the full Moon , near the Handle of the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core sample of the universe " by securing an image of objects as faint as possible with the telescope . Although previous ground-based observations might have reached the 30th-magnitude limit of this Hubble Deep Field ( HDF ) , HST provided much better angular resolution . The HDF sparked enormous interest and numerous investigations . Somewhat unusual in astronomy , everyone had immediate access to the same sample and it consisted of more than 1,500 galaxies at the farthest limits of the observable universe . Exactly what the sample had to say about cosmology and the evolution of galaxies led to a hot competition to produce the first interpretive papers , and many others have followed in their wake , The HDF also prompted numerous follow-up observations , not just with HST but also with other space observatories and big ground-based telescopes , including the Very Large Array radio telescope . To judge from the response of astronomers , the HDF is perhaps the HST 's single most scientifically significant image to date . The Hubble Constant If there was one scientific problem that became associated with the Hubble Space Telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance scale of the universe and the determination of the Hubble constant . Photograph Hubble images confirmed astronomers ' suspicions that many quasars reside in galaxies , some having a tortured appearance . Quasars are believed to light up when a black hole begins to feed on its host galaxy 's gas and stars .

Courtesy John Bahcall and Mike Disney/NASA . Photograph This Hubble Deep Field " 100-hour exposure " yielded a portrait of the universe when it was less than half its present age . This small piece , populated by tightly packed galaxies as faint as 30th magnitude , is a typical scene . The true sizes of the tiniest , faintest galaxies - thus generally those farthest away - are only a fraction of the size of " today 's " typical systems like our Milky Way . Some astronomers believe this suggests that galaxies began small and then grew . // In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned telescope , and for a time the space agency 's industrial contractors examined a telescope with a primary mirror 1.8 meters in diameter . The astronomers , however , balked . Their chief scientific reason was that they wanted to ensure that whatever telescope was built would be big enough to detect Cepheid variable stars in the Virgo cluster of galaxies , a crucial step in determining the distance scale . Also , in 1977 , when NASA issued a so-called Announcement of Opportunity for astronomers to become involved in the development of ST , the determination of the Hubble constant was the number one scientific problem . That there was a need for a better determination was evident from one astronomer in 1979 , who could have been speaking for many when he judged that " it is evident from the controversy still surrounding the problem that it has not been solved from the ground , and that the faint limit and high angular resolution of HST render it an incomparable tool for its solution - not that it will be easy even with HST . " Edwin Hubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come to bear his name was 558 kilometers per second per megaparsec ( a parsec equals 3.26 light-years ) . Since then the accepted value of the constant has been dropping , and by the late 1980s ( and for some time before then ) it was generally reckoned to be somewhere in the range between 50 and 100 km/sec/Mpc . By 1984 this problem had become a " Key Project " for HST , and it was to be awarded more than 400 hours of observing time in the telescope 's first eight years in space . The goal was to come up with a value of the Hubble constant accurate to 10 percent . The value painstakingly arrived at by Wendy L. Freedman ( Carnegie Observatories ) and her Key Project team is Hsub 0 , = 70 +/- 7 km/sec/Mpc . The team 's initial and more tentative value for Hsub 0 , was 80 , a value that prompted discussions of a crisis in cosmology . When linked to the accepted values of other cosmological parameters in vogue during the mid-1990s , this larger number implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shorter than , the age of its oldest stars . During the last three years , however , there has been less concern over this issue because tentative evidence from high-redshift ( and therefore very distant ) Type la supernovae suggests the universe is accelerating and not decelerating as cosmologists have usually believed . If true , this acceleration would lengthen the universe 's time scale , but the idea is some way from being generally accepted . Some recent work has even cast doubt on how reliable exceptionally distant Type la supernovae are as distance indicators ( S &T.; August 1999 , page 16 , and December 1999 , page 18 ) . In addition to the Key Project team , another group has used HST data from Cepheid-calibrated Type Ia supernovae to come up with a somewhat lower value for Hsub 0 , of 58 +/- 5 km/sec/Mpc . This team is led by Allan Sandage ( also at Carnegie Observatories ) , long a leading figure in determining the Hubble constant , who wrote as long ago as 1974 on the use of what was then called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's still a controversy , " and the Key Project 's value " is n't going to settle it . " Other astronomers have also produced values of Hsub 0 , in the 50s from other methods , including gravitational lenses . So , though the spread of the new estimates is certainly a lot narrower than the 50 to 100 km/sec/Mpc range of a decade or so ago , and it 's reasonable to claim substantial progress , the problem has not yet been solved in the sense of nearly all astronomers agreeing on a single value . Perhaps such a consensus - or an accuracy of 1 percent - will have to await future satellite missions . Impact Judging the impact of HST is complicated , and not just because of HST 's astronomical discoveries . Among other issues to take into account are the following .

Photograph In 1997 two new scientific instruments were shipped to HST .

NICMOS is currently inoperative , awaiting a servicing mission to fix a coolant problem ; the next one is scheduled for 2001 . In the foreground is the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) , which can take many spectra of an object simultaneously . // 1 . Even before it was launched , the development of HST was one of the major drivers of CCD technology for astronomy . 2 . The 1993 repair mission led to a big leap in the telescope 's capabilities and also gave a huge boost to NASA . Without a NASA in which the White House and Congress had confidence , the future of space astronomy in the U.S. would have been under a heavy cloud ( to say nothing of other NASA missions , including the International Space Station ) . 3 . HST , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn enormous attention from a very broad and fascinated public . No other telescope of the last few decades has so captured the public 's imagination . 4 . A point made to me by several astronomers is that the profusion of highresolution images secured by HST has also changed the way they " see " astronomical objects . Even familiar ones , such as the Orion Nebula , when subjected to the gaze of HST , are revealed to be different and often decidedly more complex than had previously been realized . And seeing objects in new ways is linked to thinking about them in novel ways . 5 . When the great 200-inch reflector on Palomar Mountain went into operation in 1948 , it dominated observational astronomy . Astronomy is now a very different enterprise , with a range of very powerful ground-based and space observatories operating at many wavelengths . No one telescope , not even HST , can now dominate so much of the field in such a fashion . While we can argue that HST has assumed the leading role in observational astronomy , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been the case even a decade earlier . This point is underscored , for example , by the variety of other telescopes used to investigate the Hubble Deep Field . Evolutionary or Revolutionary ? Writing in 1946 , the late Lyman Spitzer Jr. , father of the Hubble Space Telescope , argued that " the chief contribution of such a radically new and more powerful instrument would be , not to supplement our present ideas of the universe we live in , but rather to uncover new phenomena not yet imagined , and perhaps modify profoundly our basic concepts of space and time . " After a decade of use it seems that the telescope 's central role , through its all-round capabilities as a highly advanced observatory , has been to contribute ( sometimes with the aid of observations made by or in support of other telescopes ) in very significant ways to a remarkably wide range of astronomical problems . In this work it has indeed supplemented our present ideas of the universe . But , assuming the telescope 's technology holds up and political support continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HST in orbit to further test Spitzer 's speculation . Much of that time will be spent exercising capabilities that are considerably enhanced over those that HST now possesses .
