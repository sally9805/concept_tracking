Section : Nation &; World In northern Afghanistan , a rebel offensive and a reversal for the Taliban <p> In the first land battle of the first war of the 21st century , horse cavalry led the charge against Soviet-era artillery . U.S. Special Forces directed laser beams to guide precision airstrikes , while American cargo planes dropped horse feed and Kalashnikov rifles to advancing Afghan rebels . <p> If the battle had a certain back-to-the-future feel , so did the outcome , as the Northern Alliance claimed control of a key city lost to the Taliban three years ago . With the apparent fall of Mazar-e Sharif , the Bush administration , too , may be able to claim an important victory just when there are stirrings of public unease about a seeming lack of progress in the war . The critical city along the ancient silk roads is prized not for what it contains  --  the 15th-century Blue Mosque honoring the Prophet Mohammed 's son-in-law  --  but for its aging airfield and strategic crossroads location . <p> It also can give the United States a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are poised to ferry in hundreds of tons of food , ammunition , medical supplies  --  and , more than likely , American ground forces . U.S. News has learned that the leader of the Mazar offensive , Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum , says he was told by the United States that if the rebels captured Mazar , U.S. ground troops would come over the border from Uzbekistan to help hold the city . Pentagon officials would not confirm such a plan , but the United States currently has more than 1,000 soldiers from the Army 's 10th Mountain Division stationed at an old Soviet air base in Uzbekistan . <p> The fall of Mazar , U.S. war planners say , could break the Taliban 's grip on a string of nearby towns and give the Northern Alliance a direct supply line to the rebel forces outside the Taliban-controlled capital of Kabul . In fact , Northern Alliance forces to the northeast began a coordinated offensive early Saturday , with dozens of Russian T-55 tanks and armored personnel carriers heading toward the Taliban-controlled northern town of Taloqan in hopes of driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The great unknown . The Taliban forces may try to regroup for a counteroffensive , though their movement now makes them ready targets for American warplanes . But even if the Taliban crumbles in northern Afghanistan , what the United States plans next is unclear . " There 's no road map , " Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asserted last week . " This has never been done before . " The round-the-clock bombing of Taliban and al Qaeda forces near Kandahar and Kabul has dispersed troops into caves and into the cities , where they are hunkering down for winter . <p> Opposition to the Taliban among the Pashtun tribes remains patchy , making it difficult for coalition forces to make inroads in the south . Army Gen. Tommy Franks , who commands U.S. forces in the Middle East and Central Asia , insists that no option is off the table , yet the United States for now seems content to let the rebel forces do the grunt work against the Taliban . " It is easier to look for historical mistakes in Afghanistan than to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon official . " We want to be the first ones to get it right . " <p> To be sure , one month of airstrikes has taken its toll on the Taliban . The negligible air defenses that once existed are now largely gone , along with many of the Taliban 's supply lines and command-and-control facilities . Two weeks of carpet-bombing has also cut down the Taliban 's front lines . Truckloads of Taliban dead and injured line the roads leading toward the front , and itinerant traders in the region report that soldiers are running from their posts to escape the bombing . " I saw bodies in two trucks . They were bloody and charred , " says Mohammed Amin , a sugar peddler who passed a bombed frontline post last week . " There were soldiers running everywhere . " <p> Yet at least publicly , the Taliban is showing few signs of caving . Public displays of Taliban bravado are evident throughout Afghanistan . In the city of Ghazni , two hours south of Kabul , Taliban leaders hung what they claimed were pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result of aggression . " On a military base south of the city , tanks , antiaircraft guns , and artillery pieces sat not far from a collection of white pebbles used to spell out " Osama hero , Bush zero . " <p> U.S. officials say repeatedly that defeating such an enemy requires the patience of Job , and the American public is largely embracing the message . Yet in Europe , the calls for patience are not going down as smoothly . A French poll last week found support for the U.S. military attacks falling from 66 percent to 51 percent . Majorities in NATO allies Germany and Spain want the bombing to end . Last week , President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan repeated calls for a bombing pause during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan , which begins November 17 , saying that the campaign " is being perceived , in the whole world , as if this is a war against the poor , miserable , innocent people of Afghanistan . " <p> While they insist the bombing must continue , U.S. officials concede that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that political atmosphere to start to produce results , " says one senior Pentagon official . " Every day that you 're bombing , a few more people get angry at you . " The administration is now counting on the victory in Mazar-e Sharif to help turn the tide of public opinion . <p> In spite of softening public support , leaders of coalition nations upped the ante last week with commitments of ground troops . Germany , in a historic move , heeded a U.S. request and made 3,900 troops available . The Germans are also sending Fuchs armored reconnaissance vehicles that can detect nuclear , chemical , and biological warfare agents . Three Japanese warships will soon be joining the American Navy in the Indian Ocean , and Italy has agreed to dispatch up to 2,700 troops and the aircraft carrier Garibaldi to join the coalition forces . <p> Initially , the Pentagon politely declined the offers of NATO countries . Hoping to avoid slow , groupthink decisions that characterized the Kosovo conflict , the United States has tried to keep war management to itself  --  with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell recently assured a Senate committee , the coalition does n't " in any way , shape , fashion , or form constrain the president in the exercise of his constitutional responsibilities to defend the United States of America . " Now , U.S. officials believe that deeper coalition involvement will help foster support in those countries for the war on terrorism . <p> Southern discomfort . During his recent whirlwind tour of Central Asia , Rumsfeld was offered access to three former Soviet air bases in Tajikistan , which would allow U.S. jets to provide close air support to Northern Alliance troops . Yet such coordination between the United States and Afghans is still far off in southern Afghanistan , where the Pashtun power brokers continue , at least ostensibly , to remain loyal to the Taliban . To win supporters in the south , the United States is broadcasting radio messages linking the Taliban and al Qaeda to the September 11 atrocities and dropping leaflets depicting women in head-to-toe burkas being beaten by a Taliban guard . Since the first U.S. raid on Kandahar on October 19 , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south to weaken the Taliban 's grip over the region . <p> Unlike in the north , where the United States can tap into an organized Taliban resistance , the United States has very few people in the south who can even speak the local languages , Pashto and Dari . This hampers the intelligence-gathering process , essential when fighting an enemy hiding in southern Afghanistan 's extensive network of caves and tunnels . As one Air Force official involved in the war planning puts it , " It 's like a prairie dog town down there . Those tunnels go all over the place . " With Taliban and al Qaeda forces moving through the tunnels , unmanned spy planes have difficulty relaying real-time coordinates to fighters and bombers . <p> The Pentagon took the gloves off last week by dropping 15,000-pound " daisy cutter " bombs , Vietnam-era munitions ( also used in the Gulf War ) that can incinerate everything in a 600-yard radius . Nevertheless , the relatively slow pace of the southern campaign has drawn fire from critics who say that war planners have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is increasingly clear that contrary to the pronouncements of the president and his cabinet , we are not at war , " chides one Army official . General Franks answered the criticisms from the Pentagon podium last week , contending that the military strategy , while hampered by some logistical obstacles , is being executed according to plan . In his defense , some analysts argue that the media 's and the public 's appetite for a " perfect war " with daily progress , no civilian casualties , and endless political support is unattainable . " General Franks ca n't possibly meet that standard , " argues Anthony Cordesman , a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . <p> Northern instability . Yet the strategy of relying so heavily on the Northern Alliance has created tension between the Pentagon and the State Department . While war planners clearly hope that using homegrown rebels can reduce the U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan , some at the State Department believe that the Northern Alliance as a collection of ethnic Uzbek , Tajik , and Hazara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it controls . In addition , the Northern Alliance amassed a record of summary execution and torture during its turn in power in Kabul . " None of the factions on its own can bring the rest of Afghanistan to heel , " says one State Department official . " You do n't want to help one group to take over . It wo n't work . " <p> The Northern Alliance might already be thinking about the future . Some U.S. officials believe that the rebels have been holding back in their attacks on the Taliban , in order to preserve rebel numbers for the post-Taliban power struggle . " Should they defeat the Taliban , " says one defense official , " the old tribal squabbles will return . " In a nation that has known only war for two decades , it is never too early to start planning the next battle . <p> MAP : Afghanistan <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ATTACK MODE .
