// The Exposition internationale des arts decoratifs et industriels modernes held in Paris in 1925 is celebrated as a defining point of modernism . However , with only a handful of exceptions , the buildings and exhibits were products of historicism rather than what would be considered a modernist aesthetic . Studying the French exhibits and documents surrounding the exposition suggests a provocative answer to this paradox . The modernism of the exposition was largely the product of commercial motives and expedience . The traditional look of the exposition catered to the marketplace ; that the show was seen as modern was the combined result of wishful thinking , artful labels , and political spin . In 1925 modernism was still a relatively new concept and certainly a radical one . Although it had been incubating since before the turn of the century , it had not coalesced into a defined aesthetic . However , the avantgarde explorations of De Stijl in the Netherlands , the Bauhaus in Germany , and the Wiener Werkstatte in Austria shared characteristics that have come to be equated with modern design-geometric silhouettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament , and an awareness of the need to accommodate the machine .

Photograph // The organizers of the 1925 exposition intended that objects on exhibit not only be original but also free of all historical references . By that standard , there was very little modern design in the French exhibits . In place of bronze mounts and three-dimensional carving , cabinets were dressed in figured veneers or intricate inlays . In place of the motifs of classical tapestry , upholstery and wall coverings were marked by bold florals and fantasy figures . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels , or other elaborate surfaces . The discrepancy between declared modernism and the traditional design on display was not a calculated deception . The long leadership in design enjoyed by Paris had been eroded by Germany and Britain , and the French realized the importance of allying themselves with the modernist camp . However , it was easier to proclaim modernism than to practice it . The French were ambivalent about industrialization and were tied to an artisan tradition . Many of the designers participating in the 1925 exposition had never worked in the new style , and although they were told that " copies or adaptations of ancient styles are banned , " 1 they were not told what was acceptable . Moreover , the pragmatists among them knew that their clients " did not expect radical discourse in their furniture , " as one commentator pointed out.2 So , at the risk of losing customers through too much innovation , the allegiance to luxury overwhelmed the inclination to experiment . The French designers ' forays into modernism , although occasionally brilliant , were often schizophrenic . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every interior was decorated with reliefs , murals , mosaics , inlays , or patterns upon patterns , all suggesting the excesses of the monarchy rather than the moderation of an egalitarian age . The public and the media , anxious themselves to appear modern , took the presentations at face value . Good Fumiture Magazine , one of the most influential American trade publications of the time , commented on the " daring originality and freedom from the traditions of earlier periods " of the French interior ; , while noting their differences from the " severe simplicity " of recent American ones.3 Thus , historicist rooms labeled modem were accepted as such by all but the most astute observers . Frank Lloyd Wright ( 1867-1959 ) , for example , later commented : The Germans , Austrians and Hollanders. .. should have the credit for having carried the modem movement very far while France was still recovering from LArt Nouveau.4 Although the exposition was international , well over half of its fifty-eight-acre expanse was devoted to exhibits from France , which were understandably the most noticed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style popular in the sponsoring country at the time , from classical to folk . The notable exceptions were the Austrian pavilion designed by Josef Hoffmann ( 1870-1956 ) , the Danish designed by Kay Fisker ( 1893-1965 ) , and the Russian designed by Konstantin Stepanovich Melnikov ( 1890-1974 ) . There were more than one hundred French pavilions of which only four were modern : the Pavilion de Tourisme designed by Robert Mallet Stevens ( 1886-1945 ) , the Lyon and Saint Etienne pavilions designed by Tony Gamier ( 1869-1948 ) , and the Pavillion de l'Esprit Nouveau designed by Le Corbusier ( 1887-1965 ) with Pierre Jeanneret ( 1896-1965 ) . The latter was the most criticized and controversial design in the exhibition . This innovative modern building ultimately became the bestknown and most admired exhibit of all . More typical were buildings like the Pavillion de la Vine de Paris , classical in form and rarely of any particular distinction , and most adorned with ornate friezes , sculptural ornament , and ( to proclaim modernity ) machine symbolism . Judging by the eighteen-foot fence erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last minute thanks to the intervention of the minister of arts , 5 the conservative or equivocal approach was the wiser choice . Within the French pavilions almost 140 coordinated interiors reflected the divergent approaches of the traditionalists and the modernists , sometimes even in the same room , and not always in comfortable juxtaposition . Almost without exception it was the traditionalists who were acclaimed by the public and the critics , and in every case they were described as modern . Good Furniture Magazine wrote of these interiors : " Modern art , as expressed in interior decoration ... absolutely abhors undecorated surfaces of any kind , whether on walls , ceilings , floors or furniture .

The French designers used rectilinear shapes , which they interpreted as modern , wrapping them in exotic figured woods and patterned materials . Their lustrous lacquer finishes and intricate inlays , undeniably ornamental , were the antithesis of machine production . The most admired of the French exhibits was that of Smile Jacques Ruhlmann . His unabashedly elitist Hotel du Collectionneur ( Pls . II , IIa , V , X , XII ) housed interiors of extraordinary elegance that clearly owed more to Louis XVI than the industrial age . Tapestry , crystal , polished and inlaid surfaces , and rooms on a palatial scale evoked the grandeur of the past rather the simplicity dictated by mass production . These interiors were hailed as " museums-but museums in which one can live , " 7 which is scarcely a description that evokes modernism . Ruhlmann 's Grand Salon was admired by a Good Furniture Magazine reporter for its " great abundance of rich coloring and design , " 8 but twenty years later Interiors , then the reigning tastemaker of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obese desks looked almost as funny to us then as they do to you now . " 9 The Societe des artistes decorateurs created twenty three interiors in L'Ambassade Franaise the prototype for a French embassy . The most popular of these by far was a romantic pink and gray woman 's bedroom designed by Andre Groult ( PI . IX ) . It was a mixture of curvy furniture and extravagant materials , including lapis lazuli , ivory , amazonite , ebony horn , and rose quartz . The smoking room by Jean Dunand , although cubist influenced , was surfaced with exotic red and black lacquer and silver-leaf paneling . The much published library by Pierre Chareau ( Pl . VI ) , with luxurious finishes to temper the shock of its geometric configuration , was the only modernist mom that drew admiring comments.10 The avant-garde environments by Francis Jourdain ( 1876-1958 ) and Mallet-Stevens-the latter an almost bare room hung with controversial cubist paintings-were rarely mentioned in press reports . The palatial salon in the Musee d'art contemporain designed for the exposition by Louis Sue and Andre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domed ceiling , a huge chandelier , multicolored tapestries , and inlaid furniture , prompting Good Furniture Magazine to comment admiringly that no expense was spared.11 The pavilions of the four leading Paris department stores : Printemps , Galeries Lafayette , Bon Marche , and Grands Magasins du Louvre , were cornucopiae of popular taste , none of it particularly modern , although again , it was so labeled . Among the most widely praised settings was an altogether impractical white-on-white bedroom by Maurice Dufrene ( 1876-1955 ) for Galeries Lafayette , in which the shell-shaped bed alcove with its coffered ceiling , silk walls , silver paint , and satin-and-fur-covered bed evoked more clearly the age of the courtesan than the age of the flapper . Published reports consistently referred to the modernity of the exposition but devoted most attention and praise to exhibits that evoked familiar surroundings . The conservative floral carpet and upholstered interiors that Paul Follot ( 1877-1941 ) designed for Bon Marche led Good Furniture Magazine to comment that although modern it was tasteful " with no exaggerations that make the work unsalable a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the exposition were Rene Lalique ( 1860-1945 ) , Edgar Brandt ( see Pls . IV , VIII ) , and Jean Dunand . Lalique 's exquisite illuminated fountain , his walls of inlaid glass mosaic or the etched glass wall in his own exhibit can not truly be considered modern , nor can Brandt 's extravagant flourishes of wrought iron and combined metals . Dunand 's motifs were modest , but he employed techniques requiring painstaking craftsmanship and costly outlays of time , precluding any possibility of industrial production . // Pl . VII .

VI ) expressed " an equilibrium between the cube of the interior and the volume of its components . " 13 However , it illustrated the elaborate rather than the restrained interiors and praised the modem aesthetic for " giving a rational solution to all decorative problems .

Visitors from the United States , whose exposure to the modern movement was very limited at the time , were generally impressed with the exposition . ( A notable exception was Richardson Wright 1887-1961 , the editor of House and Garden magazine , who declared it " the most serious and sustained exhibition of ad taste the world has ever seen . " 15 ) Good Furniture Magazine illustrated the interiors it deemed " of the greatest importance " to readers , 16 but they are not particularly modern , and its reporter dwelled on such distinctly not avant-garde details as " a magnificent lace curtain of Greek tulle entirely covered with widely varied floral figures , " " richly sculptured geometric leaves , " a " very beautiful carpet . .. profusely cov erect with flowers , leaves and checkered effects , " and another with " many colored floral designs in all-over patterns which give the effect of one enormous piece of hand-made lace . " 17 The United States was conspicuous by its absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having insufficient good modern design . Although this judgment by Herbert Hoover ( 1874-1964 ) , then the secretary of commerce , was correct and a blow to national pride , in view of the quality of the exhibits , his refusal was unnecessary Hoover named a delegation of representatives from museums , manufacturers , retailers , and trade associations to report on the exposition , and 108 of them attended at their own expense . In their report they alternately admired and derided the French displays , while asserting the need to emulate the French example . " As a nation we now live artistically largely on warmed-over dishes , " the report claimed.18 The delegation felt that modernism could be the path to American artistic independence from Europe , but declared that most of the modem designs in Paris were " too radical to be generally accepted by the American consumer . " 19 The furniture was criticized for its tendency toward " over-elaboration or peculiarity of form , " shapes that " reached the point of awkwardness and bizarre treatment , " and an indiscriminate use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials . " 20 However , no one appeared to question whether the objects on view in the exposition were indeed modern , or only labeled as such . By almost any standards the exposition was a huge success . According to the American report attendance totaled more than sixteen million , with often more than a quarter of a million visitors on a given day The show was funded by a sixty-million-franc bond issue and fifteen million francs from the city of Paris , but receipts exceeded expenditures . Moreover , reports about the show appeared in countries around the world , whether or not they participated . Much has been written about the expositions influence in the United States , particularly through the traveling exhibition organized by the American Association of Museums to spread the gospel of modernism . Consisting of selections from the 1925 Paris exposition , it traveled in 1926 and 1927 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and to seven other major institutions . An accompanying brochure announced its intent " to bring about an understanding of this important modern movement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instituted in our own country " 21 However , the exhibition was composed of a conservative mixt of artisanal objects heavily weighted toward jewelry , ceramics , and glass . Edgar Brandt , identified in the catalogue as " the outstanding genius of the modern French movement " 22 was reprerented by eleven works . Sue and Mare were praised for furniture recalling either the eighteenth century or the style of the period of Louis Philippe , which preserved " the spirit of the older French furniture .. . in forms suitable for the modern home . " 23 Armand Albert Rateau " retained the spirit of the older French styles , " 24 and of Ruhlmann it was noted that he " does not depart radically in his design from the forms of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century . " 25 In choosing objects that were essentially traditional in form and praising them for their reliance on tradition rather than originality the organizers of the show seem to have preferred the idea of modernism rather than its incarnation . Only during the following decade was the stile modeme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which itself evolved into the " streamlined style , " and finally emerged as modern industrial design . Not only the Americans but the French misinterpreted their countrymen 's designs . A report published in France after the exhibition claimed that it had represented " the best modern efforts " of French artists and industries , and cited the contributions of the ensembliers , or creators of coordinated interiors , as " the most complete presentation of the modern tendencies . " 26 The comment referred only to the look of the interiors . However , the ensembliers did make an innovative contribution by conceiving of an interior as a harmonious combination of related objects . Despite its mixed messages , the Paris exposition of 1925 recaptured the design leadership France had lost and reinvigorated an international market for the country 's luxury goods . It provided a showcase of handcrafted design on a scale never seen before and , sadly never seen since .
