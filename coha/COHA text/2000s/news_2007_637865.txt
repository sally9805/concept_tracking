<p> Fresh off a trip to New York City 's Midtown Community Court , Mayor Gavin Newsom announced in March he would open a community court in San Francisco to prosecute quality-of-life crimes that plague the Tenderloin and South of Market neighborhoods . <p> Standing in his City Hall office , he said he envisioned those who urinate in public , scrawl graffiti on walls and panhandle aggressively being picked up by police and taken to a courthouse . There , they 'd be told by a judge to perform community service to pay back the neighborhood and possibly participate in social services to address underlying issues , such as alcoholism or unemployment . <p> " We are bringing it to San Francisco , and I can not tell you how enthusiastic I am , " the mayor said then , adding that he intended to open the new court by this summer . <p> Today , a San Francisco version of a Midtown Community Court is a long way off as it is becoming abundantly clear that the mayor failed to take into account important local realities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community court system and those involved have a vested interest in keeping it alive and not being replaced . <p> Moreover , under California law , police in San Francisco do n't have as much latitude as their counterparts in New York to drag people suspected of committing certain quality-of-life offenses directly before a judge . <p> And , finally , a new community court along the lines of New York 's needs the blessing and cooperation of the local judiciary , which the mayor had failed to secure at the time . <p> " The members of the community courts  --  all of those that I 've spoken with  --  they just felt really abused the way the mayor handled it , " said Jeoflin Roh , a volunteer in the city 's Tenderloin and SoMa community courts , two of 12 opened in various neighborhoods since 1998 . " It 's really insulting . They 're obviously not paying attention to us . We 're looking at the exact same issue . " <p> Nathan Ballard , Newsom 's press secretary , acknowledged the mayor announced the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . But , he said , the new court  --  dubbed the Community Justice Center to avoid confusion with the existing community courts  --  is very different from those that are already operating . <p> Unlike the existing courts , the new edition will have social services under the same roof as the courtroom itself , and the services will be accessible to anyone  --  regardless of whether they committed a crime . It also will have a Superior Court judge presiding , rather than neighbors left to decide sentences , giving it more authority . <p> " It 's like tribal justice with no enforcement mechanism , " Ballard said of the existing community courts . " They are as different from our Community Justice Center as night is to day . " <p> Since rolling out the idea in March , the Newsom administration has won a signal of general support for the concept from the Superior Court judges . <p> What may be less easily overcome are the objections of those running city community courts already  --  and the fact that the mayor did n't take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it is his office that funds them at $225,000 a year . <p> To get a sense of the effectiveness of the existing system , The Chronicle visited three courts , the first of which got their start under former District Attorney Terence Hallinan , who started nine altogether . Three others have been launched by District Attorney Kamala Harris . <p> Each court meets once a month in community centers , hotels , apartment buildings or churches . They are administered by a nonprofit arbitration and mediation service called California Community Dispute Services , which tells defendants when to show up and recruits neighbors to serve as judges . <p> On June 25 at the Tenderloin community court , one volunteer judge showed up  --  but no defendants came , though numerous cases were scheduled to be decided . At the South of Market session on June 26 , one judge and two defendants showed up . <p> One of the defendants was a 48-year-old man who was picked up for jaywalking and carrying a crack pipe . He was referred to substance abuse counseling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from police after fighting outside a SoMa club . He plays in the National Football League  --  he did n't want his name published  --  and said he already does a lot of community service with his teammates . He was let off with no punishment . <p> At the Mission community court on July 12 , which was comparatively active , one volunteer judge heard seven cases  --  most of them for prostitution . Most defendants zipped in and out after agreeing to pay a $500 fine . One man arrested for soliciting prostitutes showed up in a natty suit and tie  --  and his smiling wife on his arm . <p> " Half the cases are guys who are married with kids at home , and they 're fooling around , " said Officer Steve Thoma , who attends each month to read police reports . " They 're embarrassed , and they just want to pay their fines and get out of here . " <p> Thoma said that when he started coming five years ago , the volunteer judges would hear 20 cases at a time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Paula Bullock , who manages the courts for California Community Dispute Services , confirmed the trend , saying this year has been the slowest ever . <p> It 's certainly not because San Franciscans are no longer committing lower-level offenses . According to Harris ' office , 13,612 misdemeanor arrests were made in 2006 , and 2,979 of them were sent to community court . Most of those referred to community courts are for less serious misdemeanors , including prostitution and shoplifting . <p> The problem seems to be enforcement . There 's no punishment for not showing up at community court . Harris ' office has begun sending follow-up letters to no-shows , but does n't obtain warrants for their arrest like a judge could issue in a traditional courtroom . <p> " The criminal justice system is already overburdened , " Harris said in an interview , explaining why her office does n't pursue community court scofflaws . " No one is going to say , ' Go serve this warrant , ' honestly . That 's the reality of it . " <p> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more support . She said in a city with such distinct neighborhoods , a large number of civic-minded volunteers and plenty of quality-of-life crimes that bother residents , it 's a great model . <p> " San Francisco is so well situated for it , " she said . " I 'm not saying they 're perfect , but it 's designed to address a level of crime that frankly would not be addressed in the regular court system . " <p> Another city official has his eye on strengthening the existing community courts . Supervisor Bevan Dufty , who helped establish the first community courts when he ran former Mayor Willie Brown 's Office of Neighborhood Services , said he 's asked Controller Ed Harrington to prepare a report on how they 're working . <p> In the meantime , the Board of Supervisors has approved most of the money Newsom has sought to establish his Community Justice Center  --  $500,000 out of $750,000 requested  --  but placed the money on reserve pending a more detailed proposal coming forward from the mayor . <p> Some already in the San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York model  --  in which a judge metes out sentences in 17,000 cases a year and sometimes dozens a day  --  into gentler San Francisco . <p> " They ca n't be as harsh here as they are in New York , " said Bullock , of California Community Dispute Services . " That 's not going to fly . " <p> And there are legal differences between New York state and California . <p> In New York , police can arrest people committing quality-of-life crimes and take them straight to court . That is n't allowable under California law , which says infractions , such as public urination and public drunkenness , go to traffic court . <p> Roh , the San Francisco community court volunteer , predicted that the turmoil caused by Newsom 's proposal will wind up benefiting the existing system because City Hall will start paying attention to it . <p> " I think there 's a real infusion of new energy which we needed , " Roh said . " In an odd , serendipitous way , this whole thing with the mayor 's brash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to actually try and show the mayor up . " <p> San Francisco police Capt . Denis O'Leary , who sits in on every session of the South of Market court to read police reports , believes the city 's existing approach is the right one because it gives perpetrators of crimes and the neighbors who are affected by them the chance to talk it out . <p> " It 's a great way to get your say out in a comfortable setting  --  you feel relaxed . And we 're right here telling the person what they need to do to settle the matter , " he said . " This is working .
