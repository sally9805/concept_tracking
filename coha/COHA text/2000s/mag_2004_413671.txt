I do n't want to come off as a genius here , but I did predict this one . In a CBS promo shot way before The Masters  --  you 've seen it by now  --  I prayed for Phil Mickelson to win a major . At the end you saw that my jammies and sheets were festooned with Phil faces . Ha ha , that 's a wrap , end of script . But I did n't like it . " Ye faithless Philistines , " said I. " Phil will win ! " Now , others may tell you I actually said , " might maybe just possibly " instead of " will . " The point is , I made them shoot an alternate ending , thanking the golf gods for a Mickelson victory . I almost lost faith on Sunday . It looked like the usual Sunday afternoon at The Masters : The leaders went out , and Phil started knocking nails into his own coffin with a big left-handed hammer . He was n't the only one on the funeral march , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole show was looking like a train wreck . And who should emerge but Mr. 0-for-46-in-the-Majors ? I ca n't remember a major in which a leader faltered so badly , then regained his momentum . That takes some serious subcutaneous heart , but Phil 's demeanor was positively beatific all day . Even when he flubbed his second bunker shot of the day , at the 5th , there was no dismay . Rather , there was a centered , almost blissed-out look about the big man , and finally , when Chris DiMarco 's bunker shot trickled over his marker and came to rest about an inch behind it on the 18th green , giving Mickelson a perfect read , you just felt it was Phil 's day . The atmosphere over the last few holes was crackling like the top of the mast above Frankenstein 's lab . Phil did n't blink , not even when he stared at the scoreboard after Ernie 's eagle at 13 . There was a roar , then a number changed on a scoreboard , and then another roar . Again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole I stayed in my tower there , riveted to the monitor . Fans all over the golf course were gathering beneath camera towers , waiting for news , wanting the roars and cheers they were hearing translated into whos and hows . Our cameramen turned their cameras around so the fans below could watch the action on tiny 6-by-4-inch black-and-white viewfinders . Augusta National had never seen anything like it . Martha Burk could have run naked down Washington Road and people would have paid her even less attention than they did last year . This was about Phil . It was Guinness-ad brilliant , that 's how good it was . In the week of Arnold Palmer 's 50th and last Masters , it was exit one people 's champion and enter the next , landing flat on his big , awkward feet on the greatest stage in golf . Phil does n't hitch his pants as much as Arnie did , but his connection with fans is the same . His win was one of the biggest sports moments of the new century , maybe the biggest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't generate a buzz without Tiger Woods . If Tiger is the new Jack Nicklaus , Phil 's the modern Arnie . I always figured he was going to win a major no matter what . As well as he played in them  --  three straight thirds at Augusta  --  at the very least someone was bound to brain-fart the lead away and he 'd be there to catch it . But nobody fainted and handed him this one . When it mattered most Phil beat Els , a great front-runner at the peak of his game , and he did it with his head and his heart . His win was golf 's best clutch performance since Bobby Jones won the 1930 U.S. Amateur at Merion to complete the Grand Slam . Sure , there was Nicklaus at Augusta in ' ' 86 , but Jack was n't the " Best Player Never to Have Won a Major . " It 's fitting that Arnold 's last major was Phil 's first win . They both play the way most people would like to , with **33;1143;TOOLONG abandon . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With King Kong finally off his back , he might really go deep now . Hogan was 34 when he won his first major , and he went on to win eight more . Phil turns 34 on June 16 . If he wins a slew of majors , there 'll be roars of joy all over the place . Fans may look at Tiger with awe , but they look at Phil with love . Because it 's just golf after all , and the truth of it is we all believe we can pull off that crazy shot or stare down the winning putt and knock it in . Like Phil Mickelson , we might fall short 46 times in a row , but we only need to get it right once to prove that sometimes , just when we need it most , the golf gods hear our prayers .
