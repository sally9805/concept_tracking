Chapter One This is my story about what happened to me last year when Mum got ill and Dad and I had to go and stay at Aunt Nan 's and I had my weird dream . It 's the first story I 've written down , although sometimes I like to make up stories in my head . ( This is n't a made-up story , though . ) Normally , what I do best is draw , although I can do a lot of other things , too . I can juggle . I can sell popcorn . I can walk a tightrope and I 'm an extra clown when we need one - and , trust me , the Campbell Family Circus pretty much always needs an extra clown . I call this story MirrorMask and it is written and illustrated by me , Helena Campbell . So . Last year I had my own camper , which was n't big but it was mine . It had my drawings all over the walls . I love drawing places , imaginary cities with bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were n't anywhere long enough for me to go to school , so Mum would teach me things like geography and math , and the German Tumblers taught me some German , and Eric the Violin Player used to be a biologist before he ran away and joined the circus , so he taught me science . You probably think that with a name like The Campbell Family Circus there would be lots of us Campbells , but it 's only my dad , Morris Campbell , my mum , Joanne , and me . Everyone else works for Dad . Dad says the circus is in his blood , and it was his dream to have his own circus since he was a little boy , when he learned about the first Campbell 's Circus , the one my grandfather owned . He says the circus is in my blood , too . My dad says lots of silly things like that . Dad 's the ringmaster , also he juggles and takes bookings . My mum is the brains behind the outfit . She was once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great disappointment to everyone when she married my dad instead of going off and being a film star or something . Mum sells tickets . She talks to the bank and to the tax people , keeps the books , does things with contracts . Also she does a Spanish Web act and is the Gorilla . ( Dad bought the gorilla costume cheaply when I was seven and he uses it whenever he can . ) That night Mum was utterly furious , and it was all my fault . I 'd sort of lost track of time , and I was in my camper making up a story with my socks when my mum started banging on the window , and she 's all , " Helena , you 're not even dressed yet " ( I was actually ) , and I was all , " Mum , it never ends . It 's always smile for the punters , Helena sell popcorn , Helena juggle , Helena help with the washing up , " and the washing up , even in a little circus like ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all . " Listen to those kids in there , " said Mum . " They all want to run away and join the circus . " " Let them , " I said . " I want to run away and join Real Life . " After that , the argument just got worse and worse , with me inside my camper and her outside , and I told her I was getting dressed and not to shout at me , and she shouted that she was n't shouting , and it was all getting sort of horrid when she said , " You 'll be the death of me , " and I said , " I wish I was . " I did n't think I 'd said it loud enough to be heard , but she went very quiet . It sort of hung there in the air and it could n't be unsaid . " Real life ? Helena , you could n't handle real life , " she said , and she went away , hurt , and I knew that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what it is with me and Mum . We never mean to fight , but suddenly we 're yelling at each other and it 's all stupid . I pulled on my mask , and I ran for it . The masks were my dad 's idea . They make it look like there 's more people in the circus than there are , so you wo n't go , " Oh look , that lady on the rope is the same lady I bought my ticket from . " As if you 'd notice , or you 'd care . I was in a rotten mood , but it started to lift when Dad and I went out to juggle ( as " Raymondo and Fortuna , from Darkest Peru , " and the name is Dad 's . We have to talk in what I think Dad imagines a Peruvian accent sounds like . We 'd just got up to the gorilla bit , where Dad says , " Hey , Bambino . You want to joggle the bananas ? " and I go , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bananas ? " and he says , " What ? " and I say , " Gorillas ! " and that 's always when Mum comes out in the gorilla suit and chases us around the stage and then juggles the bananas . Only she did n't . She missed her cue . And you can set your watch by my mum . And when she did come on , she did n't even try to juggle the bananas . Just ran around . But the kids were cheering , and , you know , when I ran out of the ring I was thinking that there are a lot worse things than being in a circus . And that was when the gorilla took off its head , and it was n't Mum . It was Fred , the strong man . Mum was on the floor . She 'd passed out . The show went on ( the show must go on ) . An ambulance came and I watched them take my mum away . You 'll be the death of me , she 'd said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Continues ... )
