<p> For Clinton aide Michael Waldman , April 7 , 1995 , began routinely enough . His former college roommates were in town , and he was engaged in an ego-boosting perk familiar to generations of administration aides : showing his friends around the White House . They had lunch in the executive branch cafeteria . They poked around the West Wing . Then they peeked into an exclusive bit of real estate - the chief of staff 's outer office . That 's when things began to get a little strange . President Clinton himself was on CNN that very minute , giving a big speech before the National Association of Newspaper Editors in Dallas . Mr. Waldman knew the subject of the address was supposed to be education , an issue Democrats felt they could use to distinguish themselves from Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies , the newly ascendant House Republicans . But Mr. Clinton was n't talking about education at all . Instead , he was explaining how he could work with the House GOP leadership on its " Contract With America " agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He peered into Vice President Al Gore 's office . Staff there were staring at their TV screen , jaws dropped , while Clinton ticked through the contract , listing what he could support , what he could n't , and what he would change . " I was not elected president to pile up a stack of vetoes , " Clinton said . For many Americans - indeed , for most of the president 's advisers - this moment was their first clear look at the disarming political tactics Bill Clinton would use to deal with congressional Republicans for years to come . Rather than fight the GOP directly , Clinton decided to outflank it . He would take some of their issues for his own , while discarding others . He would attempt to appear reasonable , while portraying his opponents as extreme . This centrist course of " triangulation " reestablished Clinton as a national force in the wake of the GOP 's 1994 election gains . It also often drove House Republicans to distraction . But even as they grumbled in the cloakrooms , many in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has referred to Clinton as " the best political tactician since FDR . " Indeed , one of history 's most lasting memories of this president may be his political acumen . Even his critics concede that when it comes to the skills of his trade - poll reading , issue framing , media spinning , speech giving - Bill Clinton is the Tiger Woods of modern American politics . If he were n't , he might not have survived . The Monica Lewinsky affair and impeachment presented Clinton with a dire crisis , largely of his own making . A less adept politician might have been forced to resign , or been removed by the Senate . Perhaps history 's judgment will be that Clinton 's darkest hour most clearly revealed his strengths , as well as his weaknesses - and showed how these two sides of his personality were inextricably linked . " Clinton was never so good as when he used his skills for his own survival , " says Al Felzenberg , presidential scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation . Clinton 's gift for political gab was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His war-room called him " the Natural " for his ability to connect with small crowds in the diners and legion halls of New Hampshire and other early-primary states . But after his election , Clinton found that these skills did not guarantee a successful presidency . Far from it . After two years of administration missteps and perceived lurches toward liberalism ( remember the healthcare plan ? ) , the GOP swept into power in Congress in the midterm elections of 1994 . Enter a new political geometry . With GOP revolutionaries on the rise , the president secretly turned to a longtime consultant , Dick Morris , who had helped revive Clinton 's career following a gubernatorial defeat in Arkansas . Mr. Morris - who also worked for Republican clients - argued that Clinton could govern successfully if he embraced GOP issues , but on his own terms . To do this , the president would have to distance himself from both Republicans and the congressional wing of his own party - hence the " triangulation " tag . Eventually Clinton brought his senior staff in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euclid and feared a conservative double agent in their midst . Clinton did it anyway . The move marked a clear shift in his governing style - in fact , many aides now see the change as a break between what were almost different terms in office . It alienated Republicans , who felt he had stolen their ideas . It alienated some Democrats , who felt he had abandoned his principles . But , measured by his reelection and job-approval ratings , it worked . Not that triangulation was original to the Clinton administration . Some political analysts and historians say it is simply centrism by another name . Other presidents have tried it - Richard Nixon , for instance . Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency and issued wage and price controls , two very un-Republican actions . " Triangulation was vastly overspun . In fact , it was a very straightforward bow to realism and centrism , done with remarkable skill by Clinton , " says presidential scholar Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington . What made the move unique in Clinton 's case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most modern presidents of his party have hewed more closely to the partisan line . " This is not the way other Democratic presidents have made their mark , " says Allan Lichtman , an American University historian . Of course , one big reason Clinton 's move to the center worked was because it reflected real beliefs . He had long promoted himself as a New Democrat who believed that government should help people help themselves , as opposed to hand out money . Triangulation fit with his vision of a " third way " government that provides opportunity while the public takes on responsibility . Political analysts say it 's precisely through this traditionally un-Democratic approach that Clinton made his greatest mark on domestic affairs - signing a sweeping welfare-reform bill , attacking the budget deficit , and ushering in a new era of free trade . In the end , triangulation was not only good policy , but great politics , says former Clinton Chief of Staff Leon Panetta , one of the original in-house skeptics . For instance , if Clinton had not decided to publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , the president would not have had the standing to outlast Republicans in the famous budget battles that shut down the government later that fall and winter . " Looking back on it , it was important to kind of checkmate the Republicans on the balanced-budget issue , " Mr. Panetta says . " If they were advancing it , and we were advancing more red ink , they would win the argument . " Instead , Clinton stole their issue , and won a second term . <p> * * * The president wanted to talk to Dick Morris , urgently . The White House paged him twice in the space of 15 minutes , and when the consultant finally called back , Clinton said , " I did n't do what they said I did , but I did do something . " It was the morning of Jan. 21 , 1998 , and Clinton was referring to media revelations about his relationship with a young intern named Monica Lewinsky . Mr. Morris , who had learned hard lessons from his own messy sex scandal , suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask forgiveness . " What about the legal thing ? ... You know , Starr and perjury and all that ? " Clinton asked , according to Morris 's later grand-jury testimony . Morris suggested this was not a legal process , but a political one . He cautioned the president not to get trapped in a rigid posture of denial , as Nixon had . But Clinton was still skeptical about coming clean , so Morris volunteered : " Why do n't we poll it ? " The consultant felt sure a survey would show the public granting the president some slack . But his polling results indicated it would only go so far . When he got back to the president late that night , he said , " They 're willing to forgive you for adultery , but not for perjury or obstruction of justice . " Well , Clinton concluded , " we just have to win , then . " Before the year of impeachment , the president 's political prowess was directed mainly toward winning policy battles , as well as gaining reelection so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite a GOP-controlled Congress , he was able to chalk up two fairly productive years - signing welfare reform , telecommunications reform , and a minimum-wage increase in 1996 , and reaching a historic balanced-budget agreement in 1997 . But in 1998 , as it became clear the Lewinsky matter endangered his presidency , his political skills were turned almost entirely toward his own survival . If nothing else , the country witnessed a display of self-preservation politics unmatched in scope since Watergate . Take Clinton 's use of polls . The president had long relied on polling to test prospective policies , and even the words and symbols used to describe them , to a greater extent than any of his predecessors . But during the impeachment crisis , poll data may have shaped his actions to the exclusion of some moral considerations - guiding the president in lieu of any internal compass . Similarly , Clinton 's considerable intellect was channeled to his defense in a way that at times offended even his supporters . His parsing of simple words in a legal deposition ( " that depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed , at best , evasive , and at worst , out-and-out obstruction of justice . The president 's defense also produced a certain amount of collateral damage . Many of his staff had to hire expensive attorneys and pay for them out of their own pockets . The media 's access to the president was greatly circumscribed , replaced by briefing-room spinners and preemptive attempts at shaping public opinion , such as the release of a 73-page " pre-buttal " to the impending report of independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr . Clinton biographer David Maraniss maintains that impeachment revealed as never before Clinton 's political and personal strengths and weaknesses . Yet he also argues that the president 's strengths are his weaknesses , and vice versa . Indeed , what some might call stonewalling and delay others might judge as perseverance and fortitude . As the impeachment process ground toward Clinton 's eventual Senate acquittal , the president threw himself into his day job with vigor . He wrangled with Republicans on the budget , pushed hard for a peace agreement in the Middle East , approved the bombing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union address . Over and over , he made use of the bully pulpit of the presidency , telling Americans he was doing the job they had elected him to do , and insisting that his Republican opponents and Mr. Starr were political opportunists who would do anything to get him out of office . In fact , by the time he was acquitted , polls showed that more than 60 percent of Americans basically shared this view . In a series of exit interviews with the media , Clinton has continued to insist that impeachment was a fundamentally political move and not something that had a basis in principles of the Constitution , or law . Even with the benefit of hindsight , Americans continue to give high marks to his professional , as opposed to personal , performance . Clinton leaves office with a job-approval rating of 66 percent , higher than the modern presidency 's other two-termers : Ronald Reagan ( 63 percent ) and Dwight Eisenhower ( 59 percent ) . Yet despite this high level of approval , historians are already ranking Clinton as just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced made progress impossible on big issues , such as entitlement reform , as well as small ones , like a patients ' bill of rights . In terms of policy , Clinton 's tenure will be seen as transitional , not transformational , says presidential historian Robert Dallek . He helped turn the economy around , and kept the country in good shape for the next president - a respectable achievement , but not one to put him up there with Lincoln or FDR . On the other hand , Americans were n't exactly yearning for monumental change , says independent pollster John Zogby . The president 's limited approach to governing - tuition tax credits here , hiring 100,000 cops there - seemed about right for the times . The nation 's 42nd president , concludes Mr. Zogby , " will be remembered as an extra-gifted politician , and a great intellect at a time when Americans did n't demand great things from a president . " After a pause , he adds , " He 'll also be remembered as personally flawed . " <p> ( c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
