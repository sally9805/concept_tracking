For all its reputation as the city of tomorrow , a place that will marry capitalism and cool as effortlessly as New York City or London , the city of Shanghai , truth be told , is not a particularly pleasant place during the summer . It 's a steambath , and when the occasional typhoon blows through , it will rain for three days nonstop . Many of the streets simply reek as garbage rots in the oppressive heat . Most people , if they have a choice , try to avoid Shanghai this time of year . <P> Meg Whitman would not be among those people  --  at least not this summer . If , in fact , the CEO of eBay , the world 's most famous and successful e-commerce company , had to write an essay this fall titled " How I Spent My Summer Vacation , ' ' it might begin , " I did n't have one . I went to Shanghai instead , trying to figure out the China market , because my company 's future may depend on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " market leadership in China will be a defining characteristic of leadership globally . " Lots of big-time CEOS say things like that these days . Few follow it up by summering in Shanghai . The company cast Whitman 's stint in China as business as usual . " She goes there quite a bit but it 's not too extraordinary , " says Matt Bannick , president of eBay 's international division . " You know , Meg travels a lot . " Whitman , in an e-mail interview with TIME , says , " China is unique . It is growing rapidly , and it has a tremendous amount of potential , which is why we have made it a priority for the company . " <P> Yet her Shanghai sojourn is not business as usual to anyone who is anyone in the booming e-commerce market in China . That includes the CEO of the local company giving eBay fits there , Yun ( Jack ) Ma of Alibaba-Taobao . On Aug. 8 , the Alibaba-eBay competition ceased being a David vs . Goliath battle . Ma announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yahoo ! for $1 billion . <P> " We welcome her and the eBay team to China , and with this Yahoo ! deal , we decided to give them a nice big welcome gift , " Ma says puckishly . The move instantly transformed the pivotal fight for the e-commerce market in China into a high-profile showdown between two of the most successful companies of the Internet age . " The competition for the China market will be fierce , no doubt about it , " says Yahoo ! co-founder Jerry Yang , who has been friends with Ma for years . <P> Ma says he and Yang started talking seriously about a deal in May . The key to it , Ma says , is that it gives Alibaba a strong position in four growth segments : business to business , consumer sales , online payments and now , with Yahoo ! , search . " When we started Taobao , even our own chief technology officer said , ' Jack , you are crazy . Do n't forget eBay . ' But we passed eBay in China in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not have been surprised by Yahoo ! ' s entrance into China . " Given how quickly the Internet and e-commerce market is exploding in China , you would expect to see a number of players staking claims , which is exactly the case , " she told TIME . <P> On Aug. 5 , a search-engine outfit called Baidu , a.k.a . China 's Google , launched an IPO in the U.S. The stock was initially priced at $27  --  and closed at $122.54 after its first day of trading , a move that evoked nothing if not the infamous dotcom bubble of the 1990s . Except that no one believes China 's Internet boom is a bubble , given that there is so much potential growth .
