A Troubled Beginning // A defeated army on its return home is never a pretty sight . The bandaged wounds , the missing limbs , the hobbled walk on crutches seem even more ghastly shadowed by the sullen mood of the bedraggled soldiers ( fig. 1.1 ) . But on 10 December 1918 , the chairman of the Council of People 's Representatives , Friedrich Ebert , in office for just a month , sought to put a brave face on his greetings to the returning soldiers who had been defeated in battle . // Comrades , welcome in the German Republic , welcome in the homeland , which has yearned for you .... Joyfully we welcome you back in the homeland .... No enemy has prevailed over you . Only when the opponent 's superiority of men and mat ? riel became ever more oppressive did we give up the struggle .... You have protected the homeland from the enemy 's invasion . You have saved your women and children , your parents , from the murder and fire of war . You have saved Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we at home thank you from the very depths of our being . // Ebert , who had supported the war and had lost two sons to it , could not venture to critique the war as a tragic waste of human lives and material resources . He still sought meaning in the venture . // But he also sought to prepare the soldiers for the vast changes at home . The old rulers , who had weighed like a curse on Germany , have been shunted aside by the German people . We are now the masters of our own destiny , he claimed , and the future of German freedom rests on you , the returning soldiers . " Nobody has suffered more than you from the injustice of the old regime . We were thinking of you when we cleared out that doomed system . For you we fought for freedom , for you we 've established the rights of labor . " We can not greet you with rich offerings and comforts . Our " unhappy country has become poor , " and the victors burden us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to shape a new Germany . " // More than thirteen million men , 19.7 percent of Germany 's 1914 population , served in the army during World War I. Nearly eight million of them were still in arms on 11 November 1918 , when the armistice was signed . They had gone to war , so they had been told , to defend the Fatherland against the barbaric Russians , who threatened to wreak chaos and destruction on German soil ; against the Belgians and French , who had designs on German land and German women ; against the British and Americans , who coveted German goods and feared German economic competition . Not all Germans had gone to war willingly ; in the summer of 1914 , stirring calls for peace and negotiations had also resounded in towns and cities . There were pacifists like the young architect Bruno Taut and radical socialists like Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg , who opposed the conflict as the ultimate manifestation of capitalism 's inhumanity . But those voices were ultimately drowned out by the headlong rush to war spearheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian government . However much democracy had progressed in Germany in the decades before World War I , the army and the government still served at the behest of the kaiser , not of the Reichstag and certainly not of the electorate . // No soldier drafted into the German army in World War I began his march home on 11 November 1918 as the same man he had been in 1914 or 1916 or even in September and October 1918 , when draftees were still being sent to the front . No returning soldier found his family and his village , town , or city in the same condition as he had left it . The sheer number of casualties had been too great . In Elkenroth , a tiny village of about 700 people in Rheinland-Pfalz , 91 men served in the army during the war , 21 percent of whom died and another 23 percent of whom came back wounded . Every inhabitant of the village was directly affected by the loss of life or the physical and psychic damage of the war . All told , roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in World War I. Around 19 percent of the entire male population were direct casualties of the violence of the war . Many of the survivors lived the rest of their lives with appalling physical and psychological wounds . Some were spirited away by their families or attempted of their own volition to endure life in bitter isolation from society . Yet the war-wounded , masks covering faces that had been blown away , dark glasses covering blinded eyes , wheelchairs replacing the gait of the walker , were everywhere visible on the streets of Germany 's cities and towns in the postwar decade . Physicians had to deal also with a new " disease , " shell shock , the autism and tremors that soldiers developed in reaction to ceaseless bombardments in damp and dirty trenches. // When the soldiers disembarked from the trains that eventually carried them home , they found that the women left behind had endured their own ordeal . Everywhere food rationing had been instituted by the spring of 1915 , but food shortages nonetheless became the daily reality . In the winter of 1916-17 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one-quarter liter of milk three times per week . The city authorities noted that the bread was almost unpalatable because of all sorts of additives-bean flour and sometimes even sawdust-used to compensate for the shortages of wheat and rye . The infamous " turnip winter " of 1916-17 was indeed reality for many Germans . Many years later , one man , a schoolboy during the war , remembered eating turnips for breakfast , unpacking the school lunch his mother had sent him to find turnips , and going home to a dinner of still more turnips. // Women had also gone to work in the munitions factories . The extent of the transformation has often been exaggerated , since before 1914 large numbers of women already labored in Germany 's industrial plants . But the demands of total war , of an economy and society that were completely mobilized to support Germany 's army in the field , meant that many women moved into metalworking and munitions factories . Where once they had been few in number and hired only as helpers , now they became numerous and skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major munitions factory , the company in August 1914 employed only 963 women out of a total workforce of 41,764 . By mid-1917 , the workforce had tripled in size , and one-quarter , 28,664 in total , were women . Before the war most of the women had worked as cleaners and kitchen staff . By 1917 , they were filling casings with gunpowder , polishing metal , and working the lathes and drill presses that kept production moving . // The work was hard , the conditions deplorable . Alfred D ? blin , one of Weimar Germany 's master novelists , in A People Betrayed , had one of his characters , Minna Imker , describe to her brother , newly returned from the front , the conditions she endured in a Berlin munitions plant . She worked long hours for minimal pay . Her hair had turned green from the gunpowder in the factory . But it was not only bosses and foremen and the extreme conditions of war that created such misery for her . // We were doing piece work . The men were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six lathes to one man . In the meantime you just stand around and time passes and you know you 'll get fired . He 's happily working away at his girlfriend 's lathe . The rest can wait . Ed , I 've stood there sometimes so wild with anger . And when they 're eating and drinking , what do they talk about if not the horses ? Women . They passed the word to each other who was good in bed . They exploited our misery just like the owners . Or Wilhelm and his generals . // Women also spent countless hours searching for food and fuel . Grandmothers and aunts took to the queues , waiting for meager rations of bread , while younger women worked their shifts in the factories . Hordes of women and youth spread out over railroad yards to pick up chunks of coal that had fallen from trains , or rummaged through fields like gleaners depicted in the Bible . As women engaged in more active protests , sometimes invading and looting stores or markets , the police reacted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin police reported as early as 1915 that " there are innumerable families who are going day after day without butter or other fats , and who are forced to eat their bread dry and to prepare their food without cooking fat .... Even good , faithful patriots have begun to turn into pessimists . " The police admitted that they " hated taking drastic measures toward women . " The " hours-long , often fruitless wait of housewives " made them easily susceptible to political agitation , in the view of the police . // The burdens of industrial labor and food hunts were great , but far worse was the loss of loved ones , the husbands , brothers , and lovers who never returned from France , Belgium , or Russia . Those who did come home were often physically and psychically wounded . The pain of the loss would always remain , and was captured best , perhaps , by the artist and pacifist Kathe Kollwitz . She lost her only son in the first months of the war and spent years trying to exorcise her loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fig. 1.2 ) , commonly known as The Pieta which she finally completed in 1937-38 , is a searingly sad commentary on the waste of war . The artistic creation did little to assuage her own pain , which mirrored the ache felt by so many German mothers . // Yet the experience of the war years , for all of the horrors at the front and difficulties at home , was also liberating for many women and men . The fury of war destroyed numerous social and artistic conventions . The Weimar era , with its heady enthusiasms , its artistic experimentation , its flaunting of sexuality and unconventional relations , its vibrant , kinetic energy , was a direct result of the vast disruptions of World War I , the distorted reverberations of its crashing destructiveness . An intense desire to grasp life in all its manifold dimensions , to experience love , sex , beauty , and power , fast cars and airborne flight , theater and dance crazes , arose out of the strong sense of the ephemeral character of life , of lives so quickly snuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // For many women , the factory and the city got them away from the strict gaze of parents , pastors or priests , and village gossips . As hard as the labor was , money in their own hands gave them a sense of emancipation that would carry over into the Weimar years . The forces of order-state officials , police , foremen and managers , even their own fathers , husbands , and brothers-watched all this with great trepidation . Together , they would try to ensure that the postwar factory would remain a man 's world , but their success would be limited . Women would be removed from some sectors , like metalworking . But overall , the economy needed their labor-paid so much more cheaply than men's-and women needed jobs to support themselves and their families , so never was the entire female population consigned to the household . // The war also destroyed conventional notions of respectability and faith in authority . This was , after all , a war instigated by the elites of Germany and Europe . This was total war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great responsibilities , managing everything in sight , including labor , raw materials , and the food supply . It also attempted to manage sexuality , threatening women who took lovers with the loss of their soldiers ' wives ' allowances . The state also promised great things , a prosperous , powerful Germany after the victory , a Germany that stood astride the continent . From that position Of dominance , the benefits would flow to every member of the national community . But when , by the third year of war , the promises seemed increasingly hollow , many Germans began to attack the symbols and institutions that they had followed into war . Officials noted nervously the murmurings of discontent , the snide references to the once-sacred symbols of Germany , the imperial family and the officer corps , the disrespect shown to foremen and managers . The artist George Grosz captured these sentiments perfectly in many of his drawings and paintings , like The Faith Healers ( fig. 1.3 ) , which shows army officers and physicians declaring even a skeleton fit for military service . Grosz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected the loathing that so many Germans felt for their elites . Never an easygoing character , Grosz had become utterly enraged at the uselessness of the war . For Grosz as for many Germans , the savagery of total war undermined deference toward authority , and obedience and respect would never be wholly restored in the fourteen years of the republic . // * * * // On 21 March 1918 , the German army had launched its last great offensive on the western front . It threw everything possible into the battle : soldiers , reserves , munitions . The campaign lasted two weeks , and the army accomplished some advances but could never achieve a clear breakthrough of the Allied defenses . The malnourished German troops fell upon the provisions they found when they took the Allies ' first lines , and all the threats of their officers could not get them to move on until they were satiated . That was only one of the reasons that the German advance failed . Germany no longer had the human and material resources to do anything more than try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller offensives in the subsequent months , the last around Reims in July , and these were even less successful . In late July and August , the Allies regained the initiative and even sent German troops fleeing in panic with a tank attack near Cambrai on 8 August 1918. // Still , it took weeks for the authorities to come to grips with the reality of Germany 's desperate situation . At the very end of September , in a fit of panic-which they would later try to cover up-the two leaders of the Supreme Military Command , Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff , approached Kaiser Wilhelm II and told him that Germany had to request an armistice . Ludendorff had been aware for months of Germany 's severe military and economic deficiencies , yet had hidden the truth from the kaiser and the civilian government . The German population , still promised great things , knew even less . But Ludendorff especially was already looking to the future , and wanted to foist the responsibility for the disaster onto a civilian government based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and thereby preserve the pristine stature of the officer corps and the German army . The kaiser , reportedly , was taken aback , but Hindenburg and Ludendorff insisted that he initiate contacts with the American government to bring the war to an end . // America had entered the war only in April 1917 . In his famous " Fourteen Points " address to Congress on 8 January 1918 and in subsequent statements and speeches , President Woodrow Wilson had promised a just and lasting peace , one that ensured every nation the possibility of free development . // There shall be no annexations , no contributions , no punitive damages .... National aspirations must be respected ; peoples may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent . " Self-determination " is ... an imperative principle of action , which statesmen will henceforth ignore at their peril . // After Germany 's blatant disregard of Belgian neutrality , and the ravages of French , Belgian , and Russian territory and populations , Ludendorff and Hindenburg knew that the only hope for a reasonable peace offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans would need some sign of domestic reform before they would negotiate seriously with Germany . They also wanted to shift the blame for the impending defeat from the kaiser and army onto the parliament . In their hour of desperation , the two archauthoritarians , the generals who had spent two years directing a military dictatorship over Germany , initiated a process of democratization. //
