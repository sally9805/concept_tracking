Night Bites By Nina Bangs Dorchester Publishing Nina Bangs Cindy Harper had werewolf burnout . Six had checked in this week , and once a werewolf sat on your furniture it took days to get the hair out . Why did it always have to be werewolves ? Why not wereducks , or werebunnies ? She stood near the front door , smile already in place and electronic organizer in hand , waiting for the last few guests to check in . She knew the organizer sort of jarred with the old-fashioned feel of the inn , but she could n't help it . She was addicted to technology . Electronic gadgets were now , and her motto was : Always look forward , never look back . Looking back was useless . She had n't found the answers she needed there . Cindy could n't wait to meet people who checked in after sunset . Guests who arrived at nightfall were usually the most interesting . They understood the game . Her inn only awoke when night mist crept from the surrounding forest and twined around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Woo Woo Inn five stars for atmosphere . " Uh , Cindy , could you tell me how to get to that cemetery you mentioned in your brochure ? It 's dark now , so I figure the spirits will be up and running soon . " Her guest from the Dracula room offered Cindy a toothy grin showcasing his long pointy canines . Running away , if the spirits had any sense.Cindy always wondered what dentists thought when patients walked in and said , " I wan na be a vampire , Doc . " She smiled at the mental picture . " No problem , Latrienne . " Also known as Jim Kehoe on his American Express card . " Just take the path into the woods behind the inn . It 's about a five-minute walk , and do n't forget your flashlight . " He frowned . " Wo n't the light scare away the spirits ? " She shrugged . " It 's an old graveyard so I 'm pretty sure the spirits are down with flashlights . Besides , lots of murderers , bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that bunch . " " Worse ? Oh . " He swallowed hard . " I think I 'll take my girlfriend along . She wo n't want to miss this . " He scurried up the staircase , his black cape flapping as he went . Cape ? She needed to take him aside for some advice on the latest styles in vampire gear . Cindy shook her head in wonder . Did n't these people know that none of this was real ? Obviously not , because her inn was always full . With enough capital to indulge her sense of humor , she 'd bought and renovated the old place , then dedicated it to all those who were fascinated by the strange and unexplained or who thought they were the strange and unexplained . She 'd named it the Woo Woo Inn in a moment of wild whimsy then stepped back to see what happened . What happened was that she had a spectacular success on her hands . During her six months in business it had been pretty easy to separate her guests into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few were genetic scientists she 'd specifically invited to visit the inn in the hope that ... Her thoughts scattered as one of the final guests she 'd been expecting walked in . The impact of the man striding toward her made Cindy suck in her breath . She dealt with the weird , wacky , and wonderful on a daily basis , so she felt she was pretty much immune to anyone or anything that walked through the Woo Woo Inn 's doors . But this man ... It was as though every woman 's darkest fantasy of the ultimate alpha male had suddenly materialized in her hallway . She did n't need to burn any brain cells analyzing him . This was a man to be enjoyed on a strictly primitive level . Cindy let her basic instincts do their thing . First impressions- Tall . Broad-shouldered . Long leather coat ? unbuttoned . Jeans ? buttoned . Damn . White shirt ? mostly buttoned . Double damn . Of course , her basic instincts never spoke in complete sentences , so once her gaze wandered above his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process to do justice to him . Describing any other man , she 'd simply say he had blond hair , but on this man blond did n't say it at all . Blond evoked images of all things soft and golden . No one in their right mind would describe him as soft or golden . The wind had whipped his hair into a long tangled glory lying across those incredible shoulders . Each strand was the sun rising over the icy North Sea , the swish of a longboat 's prow cutting through the gray waves , the battle cries of sea-borne invaders . It was ... Viking . He was a dark warrior no matter the color of his hair . Dark warrior ? Whoa . She was skating on the thin ice of purple prose when she usually just laid everything out in the fewest possible words . He had a great bod and sexy hair . That 's all there was to it . " You must be Cindy Harper . " He stopped in front of her and offered his hand . " Thrain Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all husky and filled with dangerous erotic traps for unwary women . And she definitely detected a touch of Scotland there , not so much in his choice of words , but in the cadence of them . Cindy shifted her Viking imagery to purple hills , shadowed glens , and sexy Highlanders . " Hi . " She automatically took the hand he offered , but still kept her unblinking gaze on his face . His eyes were a strangely brilliant shade of blue . Blue was an ambiguous color . It was a flame 's superheated center and winter 's coldest waters . She suspected he could be both . Uh-oh . She 'd just fallen through the ice . " Welcome to the Woo Woo Inn . " Her brain 's welcome . " Oooh , yes ! Pant , pant , pant . Woo-hoo , come and get me , you big beautiful hottie . " The welcomes from the sluts who lived in her basement . " Thanks . " He smiled . Even if a portal to Hell had opened at her feet , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensual lips and great teeth , but that 's not what his smile was about . It was about temptation . Every woman who ever saw Thrain Davis smile would wonder about the pleasure his mouth could give her , and from there go on to imagine what his mouth combined with the rest of him could accomplish . His intense blue gaze and sexy smile were an invitation that said , " Press any of my body 's hot spots for sensational sex . " Cindy allowed her glance to slide the length of him . Both her basic and higher-level instincts agreed that it would be fun to explore those hot spots . " I think you need to blink now . " His smile widened . Cindy blinked then quickly dropped his hand . What had that been all about ? She 'd learned when she was eighteen never to let a man 's physical appearance affect her judgment , and she had n't been eighteen for a very long time . But she tried to be honest with herself most of the time , and she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot spots . " You 're a spectacular-looking man . I 'm sure women all over the world have suffered dry eyeballs after meeting you . " She smiled back at him . It was his turn to blink . He was probably used to women playing coy around him . Well , she said what she thought . Within reason . She did n't think she 'd share her hot spot fantasy with him . " Spectacular-looking ? I do n't think so . " He frowned then raked his fingers through his hair . " At least , I hope not . I want to blend in with your other guests . " He actually looked worried . " It 's the hair , is n't it ? " Cindy thought about some of her other guests . No , he definitely would n't blend in . " It 's the whole package . " His response sort of surprised her . Most men she 'd known loved to have their egos stroked . " You must n't look in a mirror often . " A smile tugged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling he was laughing at a private joke . " No , I do n't . But you 're wrong , Cindy . What you see now is the ordinary me . I save ' spectacular ' for dark moonless nights . " Cindy felt a stab of disappointment . He must be just like most of her other guests who liked to play at being something they were n't . She glanced at her organizer . For some reason , Hal had n't entered any info next to Thrain 's name . An oversight . " So are you a vampire , werewolf , demon ... ? " She waited , ready to put in the details . His soft chuckle mocked her . " None of the above . I 'm only here to observe . Paranormal events fascinate me . " Cindy glanced up to meet his suddenly intent stare . Sheesh . She was back to the unable-to-blink thing . And she felt ... different . She could n't put her finger on it , but it was like something alien had touched her mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Probably just the beginning of a headache . She had n't slept well today , and lack of sleep always gave her a headache . " You do n't believe any of this , do you ? " Thrain swept his arm wide to encompass all that she did n't believe . " Why do you run this place if you do n't believe in any of the paranormal stuff ? " For some reason , he seemed really bent out of shape by his insight . How had he known ? She 'd never talked about her personal beliefs with anyone . Cindy shrugged away what she could n't explain . " I do n't know what makes you think that , but I guess the truth is that I 'm an observer like you . I 'm open-minded , but I need proof before I believe anything . " And proof was the one thing that no one had ever offered . But someday , someone might walk through the inn 's door with all the answers to her questions , and she wanted to be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to invest my money in a business , and this seemed like it would be fun . " Not the only reason . Definitely not the only reason . He latched on to just one part of her answer . " I think we 're entirely different kinds of observers . " She sensed disappointment before he seemed to close off his emotions . His expression gave away nothing . Since she could n't think of anything meaningful to say , Cindy simply shrugged . " Are you really open-minded ? Would you accept proof if it were standing in front of you ? " He sounded sincerely interested in her answer , but his eyes remained neutral . Now he was creeping her out . " Sure . " Maybe . She shifted her attention to her organizer and carefully entered him as an interested observer . " I 'll have someone carry your ? " " I can carry my own bag . " Cindy looked up from her clipboard at his terse comment . Yep , she 'd somehow managed to annoy him . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope it would improve his mood . " Your choice . I 'll have someone show you to your ? " " I can find my own room . " He held out his hand for the key . Now he was making her mad . She barely stopped herself from slapping the key into his palm . " Fine . You 're in the Incubus room . Second floor , turn right . Breakfast will be in a half-hour , and then you have a choice of activities . The brochure in your room will give you the details . " She forced some warmth into her voice . No matter how strange her guests acted , they were still paying for an enjoyable experience , and she 'd play the happy hostess even if it killed her . Cindy tried to look past him , but he stayed planted in front of her , his body blocking her view of the front door . Impatient , she looked up at him . " What ? " A sudden smile softened his mouth and actually reached his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Memories ? What did memories have to do with anything ? He left her staring after him as he strode past her then climbed the stairs . Mmm . He looked just as wow going as he did coming . She smiled . What a totally sexual animal . Within that context , she understood the great memories thing perfectly . Only when he was out of sight did she return her attention to the front door . What had just happened ? Because something had definitely happened . Okay , she would n't think about it now . At least there was one thing she knew for sure . No way could the last guest top that .
