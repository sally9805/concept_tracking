<p> In 1804 an obscure English sailor named John Davis published an imaginative account of the seventeenth-century romance between Pocahontas and Capt . John Smith and called it The First Settlers of Virginia , An Historical Novel . Davis 's book disappeared from view almost at once , but two decades later , in 1821 , James Fenimore Cooper 's The Spy appeared , an adventure tale of the Revolutionary War in which the historical George Washington makes several stiff , fatherly , and entirely fictitious cameo appearances . So well received was this combination ( despite its turgid and gelatinous prose ) that ever since , with very little dissent , Cooper has been regarded as the father of American historical fiction . <p> It is a very ancient form of fabulation , to be sure , telling dramatic , made-up stories about vanished ways of life or departed heroes . Its appeal is part antiquarian , part mythological , and as a literary exercise it is at least as old as the Iliad . Homer , indeed , seems to have laid out all the essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the author concentrates on the foreground of character and action , such fiction always attempts to tell the larger history of the tribe - why Troy fell , how Rome was founded . It rarely chronicles a whole life or story from beginning to end but likes to choose instead one or two crucial episodes and begin in medias res . Its nature is to range widely , from Hades to Olympus , and its form is inherently epic . <p> In its modern version , inaugurated by Sir Walter Scott with Waverley in 1814 , a nearly archeological fidelity to historical research and detail is added , along with the working definition that a novel is " historical " only if its action takes place at least half a century before its year of publication . ( Tolstoy was well aware of both Scott and Homer when he sat down to write the greatest of historical novels , War and Peace . ) <p> In the highly personal list that follows ( alphabetical by author ) I have observed Scott 's chronological limitation of 50 years . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the function of literature is to " bring realities to mind " - in this case , broad , sweeping , musket-loading , plainscrossing , hog-butchering , unmistakably big-shouldered American realities . I have had to exclude a few favorites , either because they were written too close to their time of action ( The Red Badge of Courage ) or because , good as the novel might be ( Gone With the Wind ) , its tribal themes were too faint . <p> Death Comes for the Archbishop , by Willa Cather ( 1927 ; many editions ) . A French priest , based on the real-life Bishop Jean Baptiste Lamy , establishes a diocese in mid-nineteenth-century New Mexico and Arizona . Kit Carson appears under his own name . Cather warned other writers against " over-plotting " their novels . Here in a series of quiet , loosely related , almost gaunt scenes , she creates an absolutely beautiful evocation of American landscape and life . <p> Ragtime , by E. L. Doctorow ( 1975 ; Chelsea House ) . Fiction by the pointillist method : Drop by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly shimmering portrait of New York City at the beginning of the twentieth century . Like many other historical novelists , he mingles real and fictional characters . His originality here is one of scale and energy ; several invented families find themselves entwined with ( among others ) Henry Ford , Emma Goldman , Harry Houdini , J. P. Morgan , and Emiliano Zapata . <p> The Big Sky , by A. B. Guthrie , Jr . ( 1947 ; Mariner Books ) . It is sometimes said that there are really only two basic plots in fiction : Someone goes on a journey , or a stranger comes to town . This is the first plot . Its hero , Boone Caudill , leaves Kentucky in 1830 and travels up the Missouri into Blackfoot country , where he marries an Indian and lives as a Mountain Man until the first rumblings of the westering wagon trains can be heard in the valleys below . Guthrie won a Pulitzer Prize for a later novel , The Way West , but this is a far better story , about a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Time and Again , by Jack Finney ( 1970 ; Simon &; Schuster ) . Time travel back to New York City in 1882 . In an afterword Finney says tongue-in-cheek that he has n't " let accuracy interfere with the story . " In fact , it 's a wonderfully entertaining ( and very accurate ) love poem to an American place and moment . Illustrated with drawings and photographs . <p> The Bad Lands , by Oakley Hall ( 1978 ; Bantam ; out of print ) . This is the second basic fictional plot . Hall 's protagonist is an unlikely but brilliantly persuasive amalgam of Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Adams , a bookish Eastern stranger who arrives in the Dakota Territory in 1883 and tries to make a new life for himself . Lynchings , vigilantes , cattle drives , saloons , and brothels - it 's never been better done . As a bonus , we have the Scottish Lord Machray , likewise a stranger come to town , a spectacularly Falstaffian character based on the historical Marquis de Mores . <p> The Trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A beautiful first sentence : " They moved along in the bobbing , springy gait of a family that followed the woods as some families follow the sea . " This is followed by a great lyric saga of the settlement of the Ohio Valley at the end of the eighteenth century . Gentle , anguished , profoundly inevitable - American history as Chekhov might have written it . <p> The Great Meadow , by Elizabeth Madox Roberts ( 1930 ; Ivan R. Dee ) . One of the most appealing heroines in American fiction , Diony Hall , marries and moves with her new husband in 1777 into the Kentucky wilderness . There 's not much more to the plot than that . But here the simple , abstract theme of human nature against the wilderness is brought to life in gorgeous prose , tempered by the author 's remarkable introduction of other voices , such as those of Thomas Jefferson , Bishop Berkeley , Daniel Boone , and the poet Virgil . ( As the baseball player and manager Casey Stengel said apropos of the perennial dispute about plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting , and vice-versa . " ) <p> Arundel , by Kenneth Roberts ( 1929 ; Down East Books ) . Arundel is a town in southern Maine . From it in 1775 young Steven Nason joins Col. Benedict Arnold on his expedition up the Kennebec River and overland for a doomed assault on Quebec . Roberts wrote many best-selling historical novels , including Northwest Passage and Rabble in Arms . But for sheer storytelling exuberance and historical detail ( not to mention a rich and sympathetic depiction of New England Indian life ) , this has always seemed to me the pick of the lot . <p> The Killer Angels , by Michael Shaara ( 1974 ; Ballantine ) . Henry James thought that the novel could arrive at the condition of art only by means of the third-person point of view . Here , in a tour de force of disciplined imagination , Shaara re-creates the Battle of Gettysburg from the several points of view of its actual soldiers , North and South : Lee , Longstreet , Pickett , Buford , and most especially Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : There are no invented characters , but the techniques of fiction and history have rarely been so powerfully fused . <p> Lincoln , by Gore Vidal ( 1984 ; Knopf ) . Vidai makes two perfect technical decisions . The first is to avoid a full-scale birth-to-death narrative and to tell only the story of Lincoln 's Presidency . The second is to present Lincoln not from the inside , like the characters in Shaara 's novel , but only from the outside , as observed by a revolving carousel of his enemies and friends , including John Hay , William Seward , and Lincoln 's intermittently mad wife , Mary . The result is Homeric , noble , a history focused on a single , mysterious , barely flawed hero who ultimately wills his own murder , the young John Hay comes to believe , " as a form of atonement for the great and terrible thing that he had done by giving so bloody and absolute a rebirth to his nation .
