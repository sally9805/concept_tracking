TRANSFORMING DISSATISFACTION AT WORK // * * * // It had been a long day for the Dalai Lama . Even by the time he had eaten his meager breakfast of tsampa and tea at 7:30 A.M. , he had already been up for four hours , completing his rigorous daily regimen of prayer , study , and meditation . After breakfast he began his usual workday , and that day there was a full lineup : meeting with one person after another , he saw an Indian government liaison officer , the head lama of one of the ancient lineages of Tibetan Buddhism , the president of a member republic of the Russian Federation , a high official in the Tibetan government-in-exile , and various members of his private office staff . And scheduled among these private meetings , I watched with admiration as he met with a group of newly arrived Tibetan refugees . They had made the arduous journey across the Himalayas by any means of conveyance they could find , lucky if they could afford a ride on an antediluvian bus , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open bed of a shuddering pickup truck . Some had crossed the rugged border on foot , climbing high-altitude passes with grim determination . Here and there one could see a child missing a finger or a toe-casualties of frostbite . Many arrived penniless , destitute , their traditional chubas ( native Tibetan costumes ) tattered and dusty from the long journey . In some of the older faces , ruddy faces , weathered and creased by winds and harsh climate , one could detect traces of untold suffering , spirits hardened by years of mistreatment at the hands of the Chinese Communists . For many of these people , however , a mere glimpse of the Dalai Lama , the fulfillment of a lifelong dream , was enough to revive their withered spirits and infuse them with renewed hope and joy . He offered them all , young and old , words of hope and encouragement , as well as hardheaded practical advice , ranging from " Education is critical to success " to " Now you men should be careful of going with prostitutes-you could catch a disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last scheduled appointment for the day . And here was I. I had been allotted several hours each afternoon to collaborate on our book , and I was here to collect . Our meetings were far from chatty t ? te- ? -t ? tes , however . In fact , I often gave him no end of difficulty as we struggled to reconcile East and West , pestering him with endless questions , a fair proportion of which he labeled so silly or impossible to answer that it had become a running joke between us , trying even his legendary patience . // Standing outside on his bougainvillea-draped porch , with the majestic snowcapped Dhauladhar Mountains of northern India as a backdrop , the Dalai Lama greeted me warmly as he led me inside his home . Little had changed in this room since our first meeting twenty years before . The same traditional Tibetan thanka paintings lined the pale yellow walls , the same Buddhist shrine covered with ornate Buddhist icons at one end of the room , and the same floor-to-ceiling relief map of Tibet dominating the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , although it 's possible the sofa may have been reupholstered. // As I unpacked my notebooks and fumbled with my tape recorder , we spoke casually about some of his activities and meetings earlier that day . The Dalai Lama generally scheduled our meetings for his last appointment of the day , so as I loitered in the attached reception room waiting for our meeting to begin , I often had the opportunity to observe the collection of individuals who came to meet with him . On that day in particular I was struck by the diversity of individuals seeking his time and counsel , people coming to visit him from all corners of the earth . // Thinking about this as I began our session , I said , " You know , I could n't help but notice how many different kinds of people come to see you , people with various professions , all sorts of jobs . And I was thinking about how you also are involved in so many different kinds of activities . Now , this week I want to focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Dalai Lama nodded . // " And since we 're going to be talking about work this week , I was just curious , what do you consider to be your primary job ? " // The Dalai Lama looked puzzled . " What do you mean ? " // I was puzzled why he was puzzled . It seemed to be a simple question . // " Well , in the West , " I explained , " when you meet somebody , often the first question you ask a stranger is , ' What do you do ? ' meaning specifically , ' What kind of work do you do ? What 's your job ? ' So , if you met a complete stranger and they did n't know you or had never heard of the Dalai Lama and they did n't even know what your monk 's robes signified , they just met you as a human being and they asked you , ' What do you do for a living ? ' what would you tell them ? " // The Dalai Lama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared , " Nothing . I do nothing . " // Nothing ? In response to my blank stare , he repeated himself . " If I was suddenly posed with this question that would probably be my answer . Nothing . " // Nothing ? I did n't buy it . He clearly worked as hard as anyone I knew , harder even . And as grueling as this day had been , it was light duty compared to his schedule during his frequent trips abroad . In fact , informally attached to his small staff on a speaking tour of the U.S. the year before , I had witnessed a remarkable display of relentless activity , dedication , and hard work : as a statesman , he had met with President George W. Bush , Secretary of State Colin Powell , and a host of high-ranking senators and members of Congress . As a teacher , an ordained Buddhist monk and consummate Buddhist scholar , he gave extensive lectures expounding the most subtle facets of Buddhist philosophy . As a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and tireless advocate for world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands . As a religious leader striving to promote interfaith dialogue and harmony , he met with religious figures from many faiths : priests , rabbis , ministers , and swamis , even the president of the Mormon Church . He met with scientists , scholars , entertainers , the famous and the obscure . And in each place he visited , he met with local Tibetan refugees struggling to make a life and prosper in their new country . He worked morning till night , traveling from city to city with such speed that one place seemed to merge into the next . And yet not a single meeting or event on this tour was initiated at his own request-all were based on invitations from others . And even more remarkable-no matter how rigorous his schedule became , he seemed to handle his work effortlessly . He was happy doing it . // He did nothing ? Not by a long shot . // " No , really , " I pressed . " What if someone persisted and asked you again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case , I would probably say , ' I just look after myself , just take care of myself . ' " Perhaps sensing my frustration with this glib response , he smiled and continued , " I think maybe this answer is n't entirely serious . But actually , if you think about it , that 's true . All six billion human beings in the world are just ' taking care of number one . ' Is n't it ? So whether one is a professional , or whatever line of work one is in , each of us from birth to death is just working to take care of ourselves . That 's our main task . " // My attempt to pin him down on his job description was getting nowhere fast . And this was n't the first time I had noticed his natural reluctance to engage in discussion about his role in the world . Perhaps it was due to a certain lack of self-absorption , an absence of self-involvement . I do n't know . But I decided to drop the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // " Well , in working to take care of ourselves most people need some kind of job . Now many times in the past I 've heard you say that the purpose of life is happiness . " // " That 's right , " he affirmed . // " So , we need a way to be happy at work as well as at home , but that 's not always easy . Let me give you an example of a friend of mine . I gave her a copy of The Art of Happiness shortly after it came out . She told me that she kept it on her bedside table and read from it each night before she went to bed . She was tremendously inspired by your words , and she said that when she read it she felt it was really possible to be happy . But then she told me , ' When I go to bed , I 'm thinking that if I make the effort , happiness is within my reach , genuine happiness is out there waiting for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at five o'clock in the morning and face an hour-long commute to work . And the minute I step into the office , everything changes-I have to deal with the pressures , the demands , my boss is a jerk , and I ca n't stand my co-workers . And suddenly it seems like the idea of happiness slips away . It just evaporates . Things are so hectic that I barely have a chance to catch my breath , let alone think about training my mind or inner development . And of course the company I work for does n't care a bit about my happiness . But I need to work . I need the money . I ca n't just quit and expect to get another job . So , how can I find happiness at work ? " // " And of course my friend is n't an isolated case , " I continued . " In many countries throughout the world , there seems to be a kind of widespread dissatisfaction at work . In fact , I recently read a survey that reported that nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their jobs . I 've talked to some experts who say that the number may even be higher than that . And things seem to be getting worse . According to the Conference Board , the nonprofit organization that conducted the survey , that same survey showed that over the past five or six years the percentage of people who are satisfied with their job has dropped by around eight percent . " // The Dalai Lama appeared surprised . " Why is that ? " he asked . // " Well , according to the studies I 've read , there may be a variety of reasons , ranging from inadequate compensation , or simple boredom , to more complex factors related to the specific nature of the work or the workplace conditions . There are all sorts of things that can make a person miserable at work : poor social atmosphere , lack of recognition , not enough variety , and other things . In fact , I 'd be interested in hearing your opinion on each one of these factors . But let me give you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had dinner with some friends who were both in the software industry and worked for large corporations . They spent most of the dinner sitting around complaining about their jobs . Even though they worked for different companies , one thing they both mentioned was that they felt they had no control over what they did every day . They had no sense of autonomy , no freedom to do their work in their own way . They both complained that they did n't get enough information and direction from their bosses , but once they were finally given a clear-cut task or assignment , they wanted to carry out the assignment in their own way . Instead , the supervisor seemed to be standing over them breathing down their necks , giving them no room for creativity or personal initiative . They resented the fact that not only did n't they have any control over the kind of work they are required to do , they could n't even choose how to go about doing it . // " So , do you have any thoughts about how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom at work completely depend on the person 's individual circumstances , what position they are in. " // " Any general suggestions ? " // He reflected for a moment . " Let 's take the example of a prisoner . Now of course it is best not to be in prison , but even in that situation , where a person may be deprived of freedom , he or she may discover small choices that they are able to make . And even if somebody is in prison , with very rigid rules , they can undertake some spiritual practices to try to lessen their mental frustrations , try to get some peace of mind . So they can work on internal development . In fact , I 've heard that there is a program here in India where prisoners are being taught meditation . // " So , I 'm thinking that if people can do this under the extreme conditions of prison , in the workplace people may try to discover small things , small choices that they can make in how to go about their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly line with little variation in how to do their tasks , but they still have other kinds of choices in terms of their attitudes , how they interact with their co-workers , whether they utilize certain inner qualities or spiritual strengths to change their attitude at work even though the nature of the work may be difficult . Is n't it ? So , perhaps that would help . // " Of course , when you are talking about rigid rules and lack of freedom , that does n't mean that you are required to blindly follow and accept everything others tell you . In instances where the worker might be exploited , where the employer thinks of nothing but profit and pays a small salary and demands a lot of overtime , or where one may be asked to do things that are not appropriate or are unethical , one should not simply think , Well , this is my karma , and take no action . Here it is not enough to think , I should just be content . // " If there is injustice , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts mention what is called ' misplaced tolerance , ' or ' misplaced forbearance . ' So , for example , in the case of Tibetans , in the face of Chinese injustice generally , misplaced patience or forbearance refers to the sense of endurance that some individuals have when they are subject to a very destructive , negative activity . That is a misplaced forbearance and endurance . Similarly , in the work environment , if there is a lot of injustice and exploitation , then to passively tolerate it is the wrong response . The appropriate response really is to actively resist it , to try to change this environment rather than accept it . One should take some action . " // " What kind of action ? " I asked . // " Of course it again depends on the situation , " the Dalai Lama said reasonably . " But perhaps one could speak with the boss , with the management , and try to change these things . " // " And if that does n't work ? " // " Then , revolt ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I generally say . One needs to actively resist exploitation . And in some cases , one may simply need to quit and to look for other work . " // " Well , in today 's world , exploitation certainly goes on , " I agreed . " But in a lot of cases it is n't a matter of gross exploitation . //
