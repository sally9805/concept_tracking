Willie and Hattie Bent only had two children . Lilian , " that pretty child with the bright eyes , " and Forestine , " the big , thickset one with the nappy hair . " In 1958 , this was how neighbors in the Kings County projects referred to the Bent girls . Lilian , at nineteen , was petite with eyes a shade lighter than her deep-brown face . Church members commented on her grace and beauty . They admired her glossy , paper-bag curls and the way her poofy poodle skirt cinched a waist the size of a large man 's fist . Forestine , on the other hand , was a year younger , three shades darker , and already over six feet tall . " Sometimes I think a grizzly took me in the night and nine months later Forestine was born , " Hattie would say to friends of her younger daughter . No matter how much he loved her , Willie could n't quite find the courage to come to Forestine 's defense . She was the spitting image of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good thing . But he liked the way she laughed , especially about herself . He enjoyed how she would make up little songs and sing them just for him . Willie had recognized Forestine 's gift for singing at an early age and always encouraged it . The two were inseparable . At the end of working a full day as a doorman at the St. George Hotel , Willie would hang out with Forestine at old man Nick 's apartment or Lester 's Pub , where she 'd stand in the back near the door watching the singers onstage , while Willie sat at the bar and got toasted . At dinnertime they 'd climb into his car and she 'd drive them both home . One night , Phyllis Chubbs , a first-floor neighbor , had seen Forestine get out of thedriver 's seat and literally carry her father to the front door . Of course she called Hattie . Hattie decided not to raise hell right away . She 'd wait until Willie 's head was clear . The next afternoon Hattie was straightening Lilian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid her mother 's glare , sat in the adjoining living room next to the window . Hattie had been unusually quiet most of the morning , and now her face was as hard and blank as a slab of concrete . She slammed the hot comb onto the jet and tiny flames rose up . " You okay , Mama ? " Lilian asked , pulling a fraying blue towel onto her shoulders to protect the collar of her cotton blouse . " I 'm fine , " Hattie snipped . Forestine could see by the way Hattie waved the smoking comb in the air that she was n't fine . She could tell by the way her mother kept glancing at the closed bedroom door that she was waiting for Willie to come out . She yanked a patch of Lilian 's hair and set the comb in it . Forestine could hear the sizzling of pomade . " You sure you okay ? " Lilian repeated as her head jerked back again . " If folks do what the hell they supposed to be doin ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things be alright . " " What you do , Forestine ? " Lilian asked . Forestine continued to watch the late afternoon traffic pass through the fourth walk . Their apartment was on the third floor , so she could see straight down the walk in front of her building . Over the years she had witnessed muggings , teenagers feeling each other on the benches , fights , and drug exchanges of all sorts . Just then , the bedroom door opened and Willie walked out . He was dressed for work in his navy uniform pants , his jacket slung over one shoulder . " Mornin ' , " he mumbled . " It 's damn near evenin ' , " Hattie spat . He went to the stove and filled a coffee cup . Usually Hattie would start in on him about what errands he had needed to do for her today or what he forgot to do yesterday , but instead , she just went about straightening Lilian 's hair . Willie eyed her suspiciously . " How long you been lettin ' Forestine drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car ? ! " Lilian asked . Willie turned away and shut his eyes . Forestine braced herself . " I said , how long ? " Hattie repeated . " I do n't know , " Willie stuttered . " Couple years . . . maybe . . . " Then he quickly added , " But jes ' a little ways . " " Are you out yo ' mind , " Hattie barked . " She ai n't had license the first , ya damn drunk-up fool . " " Well , " he halfway yelled back . " Leastwise she was big enough to reach the wheel . " Hattie cocked her head to the side and pursed her lips . " You know , Willie , " she started , " there ai n't no excuse for a man yo ' age acting as stupid as that daughter of yours . " She smeared thick grease on another section of Lilian 's hair and gently pulled the smoking comb through . " Forestine yo ' daughter too , " Willie said . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sun rising in the morning , and had been since Forestine was old enough to understand . " I never have so much as a worry ' bout Lilian . " Hattie placed the steel comb back on the flame and waited . " Lord know she do n't give me a worry . But yo ' daughter Forestine . . . did you know she cut two classes last week ? " Willie shot Forestine a surprised look . " That 's right , " Hattie went on . " Runnin ' ' round out there tryin ' to sing something . " Hattie grabbed the comb from the flame . The odor of singed hair permeated the whole apartment . " I tell you , Forestine , you got yo ' priorities all messed up . " She ran the comb through the section of frizzy hair . " Never did know what was important . Need to take yo ' ass on to school , ' cause a girl look like you better have some sense . " Forestine leaned in toward the windowpane . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambush . " And she do n't ever fix herself up none . Look just like a man . " Hattie stopped talking to focus on pulling straight the small tight hairs around Lilian 's ear . " Somebody ask me the other day how my son was doin ' . I say , my what ? Like to embarrass me to death . Runnin ' in them streets and worse , goin ' up there to see that nasty ole man . . . " Then like a staticky radio that finally clicked into a station , Hattie 's words were crystal clear to Forestine . " Oh , I know ' bout that old man . " " Nick ? What you know , woman ? " Willie blustered . " Seventy-some-odd years old and sniffin ' after young girls like a dawg in heat . An old-ass dawg . . . hold yo ' head down , sweetie . . . I tole you to stay away from that old man , Forestine . I heard things about him . " " The old man cai n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' do something ? ' Sides , Nick ai n't big as a minute and Forestine beat the shit out of ' im if he try something . " " I heard things too , " Lilian jumped in . " All two of you ai n't heard nothin ' but yo ' own voices , " Willie said , waving them away . Hattie wiped her hands on the towel hanging around Lilian 's neck . She combed through the two sections of straight hair , stood back , and admired her work . " Always wished I had hair this long . Mostly wo ' wigs when I was yo ' age . But I had the body . . . Lord knows I had the body . " She shook her head sadly . " That was years ago . " " Not so long ago , Mama , " Lilian said . " Been long as I can remember , " Willie put in . " Just get the hell outta here , ya fool , " Hattie mumbled . Willie slipped into his uniform jacket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One that apologized for leaving her in the trenches alone . " And you bring yo ' ass straight in here tonight , " Hattie went on . " Do n't let me have to come lookin ' for you . " She unclipped the next section of Lilian 's hair and dotted grease in the scalp between the parts . Hattie had always fashioned herself a woman of beauty . She came to Brooklyn in the forties from Pulpwood , Louisiana , with countless other colored folks . At just twenty , she started working at the Bushwick Cab Company as a dispatcher , but Hattie never saw herself as any kind of a career woman . Jobs were for men , and she 'd only support herself until she found the right man . That would n't be long , because Hattie was a stone head-turner and enjoyed every glance her chestnut face afforded her . She was considered a whole package , with straight white teeth , pensive almond eyes , and lips naturally shaded like dark cherries . Her chest was small , but her other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no compunction about dropping her purse or hankie in front of a possible suitor so that she could turn , bend over , and reveal her true blessing from God . There were plenty of men , but Hattie never considered any to be deserving , so she always held out for the next . It was n't until she was twenty-five that a local player caught her attention . She was sitting at her usual table at the Night Owl , a Brooklyn social club , right beside one of the red paper lanterns that she tilted in such a way as to give her face a bit of mystery . The bar was in the opposite direction from where she sat , but men usually took the long way around , just to pass her . His name was Searle Watson and he was a Brooklyn numbers man . He sported a high conk , and had a heart-shaped face and velvet black skin . Hattie knew right away that this was the man for her . He had money and was as pretty as she was . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her everything she needed : clothes , jewelry , and a furnished apartment on Flatbush Avenue . She did without his time , his babies , and his name . Searle had let her know , from day one that these things already belonged to his wife . After a dozen years , though , Hattie needed more . At thirty-seven , she left Searle Watson . With no husband , no family , and no home , she had to return to the cab company . Then came Willie Bent . Hattie and Willie Bent : a union that even God scratched his head over . Willie was n't a singer , swinger , or numbers runner . He was n't a tire salesman or even a butcher who could shower a woman in prime rib or pork butt . He was n't any kind of a poet or preacher man ; he never even went to church . In fact , at the time they met , he did n't have a job at all . He was tall and so thin that he looked fragile , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in Searle Watson or any other man . Hattie first heard of Willie Bent at the cab company . He 'd tried to stiff a cabbie by making a dash for it after riding from Eastern Parkway to Willoughby Avenue . Cab number 862 had been headed down Ralph Avenue and saw number 477 in distress . The two drivers jumped from their cars and ran Willie down . They trussed him up , hands behind him , heels brushing the back of his thighs , and took him into the cab station , thinking this was the worm that had recently hit up some of the other drivers . Some cabbies had been cheated out of as much as a twenty-dollar meter . They called dispatch on their way in and told Hattie to round up as many of the drivers as she could find . " Children , come on back to the bush , " she droned into the radio . " Eight sixty-two wit ' a weasel by the toe . Get back if you can . " They brought Willie in , his hair dented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilted lettuce . They untied his feet , then shoved him into an aluminum chair set beside the dispatch desk . Then one at a time the cabbies filed by and identified him as the little skunk who had stiffed them and run . Hattie sat at the dispatch desk , cigarette in hand , smoke shimmying above her red wig . Folks who had never even filed a complaint pointed their fingers at this pathetic creature . She knew poor Willie would end up out in the back lot with a good old-fashioned Bushwick Cab Company ass-beating . Hattie phoned the police . She could n't recall a time when someone in Bed-Stuy was happy to see the cops , but Willie cried tears of joy . On the second day of Willie 's stay in jail , Hattie went to see him . She was n't a softhearted woman . Somehow , though , Willie and his pitiful self touched her . Maybe because she knew that he was n't responsible for everything they accused him of , or because he had a sad face , or perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and needed a man . She sat at a long wooden table and waited for them to bring Willie out . She had gone to see Searle in jail when the numbers house was raided , but that place was different . Hattie had traveled all the way to New Jersey to visit with Searle behind clear glass . Here at the Twenty-seventh Precinct , prisoners were lead into an airy visiting room and allowed to sit right across the table from their family . Hattie took a nervous breath and rested her hands on the wooden table . Her thumb dropped along the bottom , but she pulled it back quickly when she felt the wads of gum plastered underneath . The side door opened and Willie Bent came out . He wore that same green suit , only the jacket was unbuttoned down the front and his white undershirt soiled with tea-colored spots . He stood by the door with his hands shoved in his pockets , searching the table for a familiar face . He walked past Hattie twice before she called to him . " You remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , but did n't sit down . " JoMarie 's sister-in-law ? " " No , I am not . " " You ai n't no kin to JoMarie ? Name is . . . ? " He leaned in a little closer . " Bev'ly . . . yeah Bev'ly . That 's yo ' name . Work up at the rib house , right ? " " No , I 'm not no Beverly . " " Damn , " he said , rubbing his stubby chin . " If you ai n't JoMarie 's sister-in-law then I do n't know who you is . " Hattie grabbed her purse to her chest and lowered her head . She had made a mistake . A desperate woman 's mistake . " Whoever you is , " he said , " you got the prettiest eyes the Lord ever made . " Hattie looked up from her lap and saw the gentleness in his smile . He sat down across from her . " I 'm from the cab company , " she said . He drew back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not here to hurt you . Just wan na know how you gettin ' along . " Warily , he settled back into his seat . " Why you wan na see me , woman ? " he asked . Hattie nervously ran her fingertips over the chipped wooden table . " Them men at the cab company . . . " she started . " Sometime they like a pack of dawgs , you know . All one mind . Run together , do they business together , and Lord , do n't let nobody drop a piece of meat . " Willie chuckled , and Hattie laughed with him . " I believe that 's what happened to you . Went at you like a raw steak . You prob'ly ai n't done half the things they say you did . "
