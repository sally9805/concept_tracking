To many people around the world , the U.S. is an international bully , swaggering , breaking things , indifferent to the human or political cost . Some movie people , for whom every perceived moral disaster is just a melodrama waiting to be scripted , think they have a fantasy answer to the threat of America : blow it up . <P> That , at least , was the solution proposed in the two works that dominated the 56th Cannes Film Festival . One picture came in with all the hype : Dogville , Danish director Lars von Trier 's upending of Our Town into the tale of a small-minded Colorado community that torments a beautiful stranger ( Nicole Kidman ) and fully earns its violent comeuppance . The other film arrived with little fanfare but walked away with the major awards . Elephant , which transposes the Columbine , Colo. , massacre to an Oregon high school , won the Palme d'Or as top film and the Best Director prize for Gus Van Sant . Dogville was shut out  --  not a kibble . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint their own conspiracy theories . And while it wildly oversimplifies Elephant and Dogville to see them as primarily , or even tangentially , anti-American , the jury did honor a film critical of the American addiction to gun violence  --  as it did with a prizewinner last year , Michael Moore 's Bowling for Columbine . <P> Van Sant 's terse ( 80 min. ) , remorseless film , made for HBO , describes , with fascination but no special urgency , a typical day at a generic high school . For minutes on end , the camera tracks the movements of several students at Watt High : a blond boy arriving late because he has been caring for his alcoholic father , an athlete and his pretty girlfriend planning their calendar , and two lads arming themselves for their own private Armageddon . <P> Then the shooting starts . The lyrical pseudo-documentary style quickly lurches into horror-film mode . The killers stalk their prey down the bright corridors as efficiently and implacably as any Jason or Freddy . They spring out of nowhere , giving their victims ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the id  --  our worst nightmare . Not America 's . Humanity 's . <P> This is n't a terrific film ; it 's a murmuring , meandering study with an apocalyptic punch line . But the corpses strewing the school corridors do n't make the movie anti-American , any more than Hamlet is anti-Danish . Elephant depicts evil , and the ordinary people who , through bad luck , get in its way .  --  By Richard Corliss
