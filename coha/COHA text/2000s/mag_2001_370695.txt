If you 're stunned as you watch your 401(k) balance shrink , know that your pain is shared by millions  --  reflecting a broad decline that has n't occurred since these retirement-savings plans started 20 years ago . A recent study by Cerulli Associates shows the average account lost nearly $5,000 in 2000 . With the equity markets expected to stay cool for a while , researchers at the benefits consulting firm say the growth of 401(k) assets is likely to continue to taper . <P> But sinking stocks may not be your only problem . Have you taken the time to design a well-diversified plan ? Even " affluent " baby boomers  --  those with household incomes between $50,000 and $125,000 a year  --  spend less than an hour a month planning for their retirement . That 's just one of several blunders identified by " Boomers on the Brink , " a survey of 35-to-55-year-olds ' retirement-savings strategies conducted by ING Aetna Financial Services . <P> Here are a few other missteps and ways to avoid them : <P>  --  Confusing your 401(k) plan with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many boomers are dipping into the largest pot they have . But if you quit or lose your job , you have to pay back the whole loan amount quickly or you will owe taxes on the money , plus a 10% penalty if you 're under age 59 1/2 . Another trap : cashing out when you change jobs . Sure , you will start another 401(k) , but you 've lost momentum from compounding interest . Solution : Do n't dip . You will need at least 70% of your preretirement income to retire comfortably . <P>  --  Failing to protect your main asset : you . Nearly 40% of workers surveyed in the ING report do n't have disability insurance . Yet the same percentage have a good chance of being out of work for three months or more at some point . Solution : Get some disability insurance  --  the inflation-indexed kind is best . <P>  --  Living beyond your means . Too many of us love to buy now and pay later . Metropolitan Life estimates younger boomers have amassed personal debt equal to 95% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kids ' education , there 's little extra cash to put away for the golden years . Solution : Start paying off those credit cards now . Whittle down as much as you can afford each month  --  and save . If you start today by investing $150 monthly ( with an 8% return ) , you will have about $27,625 after 10 years , according to Putnam Investments . Start three years from now , and you will have stashed away just $16,929 . <P> The new tax bill may also help . Next year a special " catch-up " provision lets workers 50 and older contribute an extra $1,000 to their 401(k)s , increasing $1,000 each year to $5,000 by 2006 . For IRAs , the limits are $500 in 2002 through 2005 and $1,000 after that . <P> So do n't get blindsided by common blunders . In the long term , if you stick to your plan  --  and continue to re-evaluate it  --  you will be less likely to fall short of your goals . <P> For daily economic news and analysis visit  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
