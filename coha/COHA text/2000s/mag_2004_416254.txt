3 moves to strengthen your lats and give you a sleek and sexy look By stacy whitman TRAINER 'S STRATEGY Use real-life and sport-specific movements to effectively work the latissimus dorsi and build strength . WHY IT WORKS These exercises , designed by trainer Scott Berlinger , involve two key motions - downward pulling and rowing - to train your largest back muscle in a functional way and give you more strength and endurance for your athletic pursuits . You 'll start with the lat pull-down , one of the best exercises to target your lats . However , for a twist on the traditional , you 'll forgo use of the kneepad to increase the challenge . Next you 'll do the resistance-band pull , a standing exercise that hits deep into the upper fibers of your lat muscle . You 'll finish with a one-arm row , which strengthens both sides of your back egually by working each arm separately for a balanced upper body . // MUSCLES WORKED middle back and rear shoulders : 1 . latissimus dorsi 2. teres major 3. posterior deltoid // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your upper body , covers the lower and middle portions of your back , originates at your spine and the top of your hipbone and attaches to your upper arm . It 's responsible for downward movements of your upper arm , as your elbows pull down and inward toward your waist , and also works when you extend your arms behind you . The teres major originates at the inside lower edge of your shoulder blade ; it attaches on your upper-arm bone and performs the same movements as the lats . The posterior deltoid moves your upper arm back and away from your body . DETAILS You 'll need a lat pull-down machine , a light- to mediumresistance band , and a set of 5- to 15-pound dumbbells . Warm up with 5 minutes of low-intensity cardio . End by stretching your back muscles , holding each stretch for 30 seconds without bouncing .

Photograph // WHAT WORKS Knowing how to engage your lats is necessary to achieving a strong , sculpted back . " The lats can be a tricky muscle to target , " explains Scott Berlinger , creator of Full Throttle Endurance Training and Racing at the Sports Center at Chelsea Piers in New York City . If you do n't recruit the muscle properly , the biceps will take over , diminishing the effort in your lats , he adds . Berlinger recommends first squeezing your shoulder blades together , then actively contracting your lats by pressing them downward before doing each move . As you perform the exercises , concentrate on using your back muscles , not your arms , and continue drawing your shoulder blades together . Do n't forget : Proper form is more important than how much resistance you 're using . " Do n't be afraid to lower the weight if you feel the tension leaving your lats , " Berlinger says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anchor you will force you to use your core muscles to stabilize your position and stop you from using your knees for leverage . // 1 . lat pull-down Strengthens middle back , rear shoulders , some biceps * Attach a long bar to a lat pull-down machine , grasp the bar with an overhand grip , slightly wider than shoulder-width , and sit down , seat adjusted so thighs are parallel to floor and kneepad is elevated so thighs are n't touching it , knees bent and aligned over ankles , feet flat on floor . * Contract abs and lean back from hips so bar is positioned over breastbone , arms straight and wrists in a neutral position . * Without using kneepad , draw shoulder blades down and together to stabilize your position , then contract your back muscles and drive elbows down and in toward waist as you lower bar toward breastbone , simultaneously lifting chest toward bar . * Pause , keeping back straight , then slowly straighten arms to starting position .
