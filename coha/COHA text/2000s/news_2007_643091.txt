<p> On a recent visit to the new cafeteria of The New York Times , Julia A. Stewart , 52 , complimented the gleaming hardwood floors and then suddenly stopped . " I 'm sorry , " she said , as she stepped around a coffee spill to grab a few napkins and then proceeded to clean it up . <p> Ms. Stewart , the chairwoman and chief executive of the IHOP Corporation of Glendale , Calif. , knows a hazard when she sees one . She can also apparently spot a bargain . <p> Last month , IHOP  --  the International House of Pancakes  --  jumped to the head of the pack to become a strategic buyer of the troubled Applebee 's International chain in Overland Park , Kan . IHOP 's market value is about half of Applebee 's . <p> Since Ms. Stewart 's arrival in 2001 , IHOP has transformed itself into a pure-play franchiser  --  more than 99 percent of its 1,319 restaurant system owned and operated by franchisees . <p> It says it believes it can do the same with Applebee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants . <p> During her visit , Ms. Stewart , who worked as an IHOP waitress in high school and later was a president at Applebee 's , spoke of the deal and IHOP 's turnaround . Following are excerpts : <p> Q.You surprised a lot of people with your announced plans to buy Applebee 's International for $1.9 billion  --  in cash  --  plus the assumption of debt . How did the deal come together ? <p> A. We announced in January 2006 that we would be looking at strategic alternatives , which included an acquisition . <p> It had to be a concept that did not compete with our base business . So it could n't be in the family dining category , because we did n't want to jeopardize our terrific relationship with our franchisees . It had to be something in either casual or fast food or specialty . <p> Secondarily , it had to be something of significant size . It had to matter . And it had to be something that would really fit with our core competencies . It had to be a strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright steal " at that price . <p> A. At $25.50 , it is certainly a 4 percent premium to the day before the announcement was made . But it is a significant premium , upward of 20 percent when they announced they were going to consider selling the company . <p> Q. This is a critical moment in your career  --  you are basking in the glory of 18 consecutive quarters of growth at IHOP and a strong stock price . What if you bet wrong on Applebee 's ? <p> A. I do n't see it that way . I see it as we successfully turned IHOP into this fabulous successful brand , as measured by top-line sales and franchisee health and consumers  --  and we are now doing the same exact thing at Applebee 's , so to me , it 's just more of the same . I do n't see it as a turning point but a repeat . <p> Q. Your experience with Applebee 's has to help . <p> A. For me , it 's a sense of familiarity , rekindling relationships  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for the brand , I think , makes for a great match . <p> Q.After you complete the Applebee 's transaction , pending approval of Applebee 's shareholders and regulators in the fourth quarter , what 's next ? <p> A. I think we 're happy now . Let 's get through the transaction . I think right now our real focus is integrating the two brands . There is synergy and opportunity . <p> Q.Your franchisees have given you a nickname  --  the Velvet Hammer . What 's that all about ? <p> A. What that means is  --  I think , because it is their nickname  --  that I am tough on standards and raising the bar , but I do it in a caring manner . I think I am a very people person , I 'm very supportive . My style is much more collaborative , to do it in a relationship-building way . <p> It is a different set of skills to run a franchise organization . No one reports to me . These are all very successful businessmen and women who have an entrepreneurial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they want the leadership and direction from us as the franchiser . It 's a fine line you walk in providing leadership and direction and strategy and tools , but doing it in a way where it is a push-pull . <p> Q.If you had to eat all your meals at IHOP and Applebee 's for one day , how would you do it ? <p> A. I 'd start at IHOP , have a fabulous cup of our new and improved coffee and a glass of orange juice . I 'd probably order a short stack of our famous buttermilk pancakes , and a side of our delicious bacon . <p> Then I 'd split my lunch visit . First I 'd have lunch at Applebee 's . I 'd do a pick and pair  --  soup and salad  --  with a refreshing glass of iced tea . Then I 'd run over to IHOP , to have our new spinach chicken salad , probably with lemonade . <p> Then I 'd go back to Applebee 's for dinner , and have our new steak dinner with mushroom topping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I might have dessert at both places . That 's a perfect day . In between I might try to jog . <p> Q.IHOP will soon be celebrating 50 years , and you are making changes to the restaurants . What 's the new look ? <p> A. On the inside , think of it as warm colors , lighting for breakfast , lunch and dinner . Think of it as the decor package much more befitting an American icon . Think of the uniforms as much more contemporary , the same with the glassware , plateware , silverware . It 's still the heritage of IHOP but much more contemporized and much more a place you 'd want to go eat breakfast , lunch and dinner . And the colors are more warm , gold tones . Much more befitting of a brand in the 21st century . <p> The prototype is the same look inside . On the exterior we were able to add an A frame , and the entry is beautiful . It takes on the heritage . We 're known for the chalet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more contemporary . We intend to do the same thing with Applebee 's , contemporary but grounded in the bar and grill look . <p> The menu needs to be an ongoing process , and frankly that 's the point I 'm trying to make here . My commitment to the franchisees of both brands is that we 'll continue to evolve and stay contemporary , yet grounded in our heritage so we do n't fall beyond . With IHOP 50 years next year and Applebee 's almost 30 years  --  two American icons coming together , to form the largest sit-down restaurant chain in the world. ##
