Asking a die-hard sports spectator to predict how we will spectate in the future can cause terrible cognitive dissonance . The sports fan is not oriented toward the future ; he is the retrospective creature par excellence . He travels forward with his eyes glued to the rearview mirror . His preferred modes of spectating are historical  --  the highlight reel ; the classic NFL film with its sonorous , Homeric narration ; and , most perfectly , the instant replay , which , of course , instantly historicizes the present . <P> Obviously , the essential need to spectate will endure into the distant future . We ca n't talk sports unless we watch sports . And talk we must . Sports blather will remain the lingua franca in bars , elevators and doctors ' waiting rooms around the world . In 2025 , no matter how far-flung or misbegotten a place he finds himself in , man will always be able to strike up a lively conversation with the opening gambit " Livingston Bramble , Boom-Boom Mancini , 1985 . That was a fight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the last areas in our life in which we can experience the unexpected , the improvisational . But how we watch will change radically . The two primary styles of live spectating  --  the self-aggrandizing preening of the ringside celebrity and the self-annulling ecstasy of the anonymous face-painted fan  --  will soon be relics of the past , available only in dioramas in sports museums . <P> Referring to the Golden Age of the Latin American caudillo , Ryszard Kapuscinski wrote that " stadiums play a double role : in peacetime they are sports venues ; in war they turn into concentration camps . " Well , in the future , in the synergistic bliss of the globalized economy , stadiums and arenas will simply turn into malls and food courts . The live event  --  the game itself  --  will become , at best , a point-of-purchase display . Already , most people attending a basketball game rarely glance at the live action . They watch the Jumbotron screens cantilevered above the court or the monitors mounted in the arena 's various saloons and emporiums . <P> Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers or stand in line and chat with other people who also have to urinate badly , there will be no valid reason to attend a live sports event as a spectator . All sports , and especially football , will continue to be better on TV . The only way to sustain interest in actual attendance at sports events in the future will be to incorporate fans into the action . But how ? <P> Recent incidents , such as the projectile-throwing tantrum at the Yankees-Red Sox game at Fenway Park and the abuse of European golfers at the Ryder Cup in Brookline , Mass. , suggest an answer : legal hooliganism . Teams will sponsor cells of well-trained , remorseless thugs ready at any moment to storm the field and waylay players . Athletes will be expected to hone those skills necessary to contend with this exciting new variable .
