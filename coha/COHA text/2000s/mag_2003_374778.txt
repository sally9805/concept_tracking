The man with the square moustache jumped onto a table and fired a shot into the ceiling of the Buergerbraukeller , a large beer hall in Munich . " The national revolution has begun , " he shouted . Not quite . Adolf Hitler was forcing the issue . With Germany seething at the spineless Weimar government over the humiliating terms of the World War I armistice , Hitler sensed an opportunity . Just before 9 p.m. , his Nazis launched a putsch , or coup d'etat , taking three powerful officials hostage . With hundreds of his Storm Troopers surrounding the hall , he compelled the trio to support him . But Nazi euphoria was fleeting ; Hitler 's three " supporters " slipped away and denounced him . Police opened fire on the Nazis when they took to the streets the next day . Hitler was arrested . The putsch was a joke . But at his trial , Hitler beguiled the populace with orations for restoring German greatness . After serving only eight months of a five-year sentence , he emerged from jail with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kampf . The joke would have a devastating punch line .  --  By Howard Chua-Eoan
