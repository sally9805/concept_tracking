Star Wars ( r ) Legacy of the Force Betrayal By Aaron Allston Random House Aaron Allston Leia Organa Solo , one-time princess of the world of Alderaan , former Chief of State of the New Republic , now a Jedi Knight , stood dressed in all-white robes , suitable to either a Jedi or a politician in informal surroundings , before the portal . It was not an ordinary door ; though in appearance it was identical to billions of dwelling exterior doors found on the world of Coruscant , in reality it was not . In the recent past , the original low-cost , composite-material door had been replaced with this innocuous-appearing thing of armor . It would hold against blaster assault -- for a while , anyway . The cool blue it was painted belied its defensive function . Leia 's husband , Han Solo , one of the most famous men in the galaxy , moved up beside her . He was wearing his favorite clothes : dark military trousers decorated with the red Corellian Bloodstripes he had earned when he was a younger man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except for the lines in his face and gray in his hair , honestly earned through deeds as well as accumulated over the passage of time , he was indistinguishable from the man she 'd met aboard the first Death Star so many years ago . Her spirit lifted . No matter how badly things went , they were always better with Han at her side . Not that she 'd necessarily tellhim that . His ego had n't diminished in all those years , either . Han looked gravely at the door . " You figure that 's how they 're going to come at us ? " She nodded . " That 's the only approach that makes any sense , and you know it . " " Well , the only strategy that makes any sense is for us to just open the door for them . They 're less likely to attempt some sort of sneaky side entry if the front is open . We can pick them off as they 're framed in the doorway . Once their numbers become too great for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leia considered . " I do n't know . Maybe I should be up front and center to bat back their blaster assaults while you fire on them from the side . " " Oh , my . " This third voice was higher-pitched than Han 's and carried just a hint of alarm . " If I may ask , has there been some change of plans ? " Han and Leia turned . Entering the outer chamber was C-3PO , the gold-toned protocol droid who had served them faithfully -- if fussily -- for four decades . C-3PO moved up to them , his every action accompanied by the barely audible sound of whining servos , and added , " I thought that the plan was to admit them , then feed them the appetizers I have labored for so long to assemble . Appetizers that are laid out in the kitchen . Was I wrong ? Will there be shooting ? " Han and Leia exchanged a glance . " Appetizers would be easier , " Han admitted . " Fewer blaster bolts hitting the walls , fewer repairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that way . " " All right , Goldilocks . " Han clapped C-3PO on one shining shoulder , rocking the droid in place . " We 'll do it your way . This time . " " You 're toying with me again , are n't you , sir ? " C-3PO 's sigh was audible . Han nodded . " It 's more fun and less destructive than hanging meat around your neck and letting the war-dogs loose on you . " " Humpf . " The droid turned back toward the door through which he 'd entered . " Not very sporting , I must say . " A chime filled the air -- the delicate first five notes of " Path to the Sky , " a ballad from Leia 's homeworld of Alderaan . Han heaved a sigh . " Not too late to change your mind . We could hold them off for days . " Leia smiled at him . " Hush . " # First through that door were Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker . For this occasion , Luke wore his black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still-fair complexion and bright blond hair . Mara wore more traditional Jedi robes in browns and tans , and a red belt that set off her red hair . With them was R2-D2 , the plug-shaped astromech who had variously served Luke and the Solos for decades , and the little droid made as many musical , wheetling noises of appreciation during their tour of the Solos ' new quarters as the humans made verbal comments . Next to arrive , just a few minutes later , were Jacen and Ben . Led from room to room by C-3PO , Jacen made noncommittal noises about the antechamber , living chamber , master bedroom , bedrooms for Leia 's Noghri bodyguards Meewalh and Cakhmaim , guest bedrooms , library , refreshers , furnished balcony , kitchen , dining room , and communications center , all but the last decorated and furnished in warm-colored hardwoods , some with dark carpets and some with pebbled flooring . The communications center , where the majority of the household 's computers and electronics repair equipment was kept , was more modern , all steely surfaces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Where are the secret chambers ? " C-3PO stopped short and leaned awkwardly to look at the boyman . " I do n't quite understand , young sir . " " C'm on . " Ben grinned up at the droid -- not far up , as he 'd grown centimeters since the last time he 'd seen the protocol droid . " Uncle Han is a smuggler . I bet this place is stuffed with secret chambers . They 'll all have blasters in them . Some of them will have identicards in fake names , and credcards , and secret electronics gear , and maybe a disassembled scoutspeeder . Some of them will be hidey-holes for the Noghri . " C-3PO 's voice was stiff , even for the droid . " I can assure you , sir , that there are no secret chambers . " " Aha ! " Ben held up an accusative finger . He sounded as though he 'd just found the essential clue to solve a murder . " I can assure you is n't the same thing as There are no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no secret chambers . ' " " I can assure you , sir , that there --  " " Aha ! " The droid shot Jacen a look that , a far as Jacen could interpret droid body language , looked hurt . " I say , sir , must every generation of Solos and Skywalkers act like this ? " Jacen nodded . " Pretty much , yes . " In the living chamber , as C-3PO held out his carefully arrayed tray of geometrically shaped cheeses and fungus crackers to Mara , Leia said , " Jaina just called in . She and Zekk are just a few minutes out . " Han straightened , irritably , on the couch . " And Zekk . Who , may I ask , invited Zekk ? He 's not family . " Luke and Mara managed to say " Not yet " simultaneously . Han glared at them . " I invited him , " Leia said . " Just now . Otherwise , he would have gone off to the Temple , been alone in whatever tiny chamber they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alone --  " " While rain poured on his head wherever he moved and sad synthesized music filled the hallways . " Han shot her a scornful look . Leia merely smiled at him , the maddening smile of a politician who wo n't be budged from her position . " Han , he 's her partner . Her Jedi partner . If he were her , say , smuggling partner , would you send him off ? " " Depends on how he looks at her . Y'see , here 's the problem . A father 's got a right to terrorize any young bantha who 's following his daughter around . " Leia shook her head . " Jaina says they 're friends . Just friends . " Han 's scowl deepened and became almost comic . " Jaina 's got herself blinded . It 's got to be one of those Force abilities -- they say the Force can have a profound effect on people who do n't want to believe the truth . " Luke snorted . " No , they do n't . " " Anyway , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Zekk 's a Jedi . He does n't scare easily . So what do I do ? " Han considered , then looked around . In corners of the room , motionless , inconspicuous , stood Leia 's bodyguards , Meewalh and Cakhmaim , members of the Noghri species -- gray-skinned , no taller than R2-D2 , shrouded in concealing cloaks . Like hold-out blasters , they were small , hard to detect , and deadly . " Maybe we could get Meewalh and Cakhmaim to rattle him . " " Give it up , Han , " Mara suggested . " Leia , I like your quarters . " " Thanks . " Leia settled on the couch beside her sulky husband . " It 's really nice to have someplace that 's permanent , not the hotel of the month , or quarters aboard some political ship , or the living compartment on the Falcon . It 's the first place we 've been able to really call home since Coruscant fell . " A shadow crossed her face . Coruscant had fallen to the Yuuzhan Vong at almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had died . Those had been dark times . " We almost decided on Corellia , " Han said . " A planet where you can move more than three meters without hitting a wall . But we have too many family and friends here . " The door chime rang again . " Speaking of which . . . " This time it was Jaina and Zekk . Jaina , too , was in standard Jedi robes , hers made of hard-wearing cloth suited to travel and styled to be less conspicuously those of a Jedi Knight . She was of about the same height as her mother , and more slender of build , with dark eyes and delicate features . Zekk , her partner , was in his late twenties , slightly younger than Jaina , but was otherwise her opposite in almost every way -- tall enough for his scalp to scrape the top of the doorway as he entered , his long black hair pulled back in a ponytail , he would stand out in any crowd regardless of the cut and color of his traveler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful , energetic appearance . But he was , in contrast with his good nature , quiet almost to the point of shyness during the tour he and Jaina received of the quarters . His one comment was to Leia : " I take it that the Vongforming has pretty much been beaten back from this area ? " At the height of the Yuuzhan Vong war , when Coruscant had fallen , the Yuuzhan Vong had used their arts to alter the very nature of the world , installing a World Brain to coordinate the reshaping of the planet . Under the brain 's guidance , they introduced overwhelming quantities of fauna and flora to erode the construction that nearly covered Coruscant 's surface and replaced indigenous species with Yuuzhan Vong species , attempting to eradicate every sign that any species but the Yuuzhan Vong had lived here . The process , called Vongforming , would have been complete within a few standard decades , save that Jacen Solo , who had befriended the World Brain during his captivity , convinced it to turn on its makers and help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vong-forming was slowly being reversed by the aggressive use of technology and toxins , but everywhere on Coruscant there remained signs of the World Brain 's influence -- alien molds that lived in cracks and gaps and culverts , insect species that had become a part of Coruscant 's ecosystem , odd and dangerous life-forms who now dwelled in the darkness of the sewers and other subterranean infrastructure . Leia shrugged . " A few kilometers from here , you get weirdly overgrown ruins and some areas I can only think of as alien parks . It 's much more normal around here , " she said . " The nearby areas that were , before the change , dangerous after dark or too deep for sunlight to reach are just slightly more so now . It 's like Coruscant used to be . . . except the shadows have a little more in them , you know what I mean ? " Zekk nodded , smiling slightly . " I know all about that . " # The argument began over spiceloaf . Spiceloaf was not the cause of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the heat tolerance of the diners , was , as Leia had prepared it , both mild and savory , and was not likely to cause disagreement all by itself . It was merely the course that was on everyone 's plate at the point Han decided to become argumentative . He set his fork down and looked suspiciously at his nephew Ben . " You were doing what ? " " Making sure they did what the government said . " The boy returned his uncle 's stare , unintimidated . " Stopped making weapons except for the government . " " Well , that 's an oversimplification , " Jacen said . " This Adumari company was producing explosive ordnance beyond what was permitted for delivery to the Galactic Alliance armed forces or otherwise legal as per Order **31;295;TOOLONG is , beyond the amounts necessary for their own planetary defense . In other words , they were assembling proton torpedoes and other missiles for sale to other planets , not for delivery to the GA . " " So ? " Han asked . " That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians with nothing better to do . Next thing you know , we 'll have Jedi walking the government halls on Corellia and telling us what to do . " Leia smiled . Han had n't lived on Corellia for decades , but in his heart , he was all Corellian , embodying the swagger , the cockiness , the carefree attitude that the citizens of that system considered essential elements of their culture . His exploits during the Rebellion and up through the present day had made him dear to the hearts of the people of that system . The second best-known Corellian hero of the same era , Wedge Antilles , did live in the Corellian system , but he was more reserved , less brash , and simply had n't captured the public 's affection as Han had . But Luke was n't as amused . " Han , the Corellians are playing a dangerous game . They 're demanding all the advantages of Galactic Alliance membership -- trade benefits , use of the GA communications and travel infrastructure , citizenship rights , all of it -- but not contributing their fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on supplying ships and personnel to the military , on providing tax revenues --  " " See , that 's the thing . " Han pointed his fork at Luke 's chest as if intending to jam it in and probe around the heart and lungs . Continues ...
