A departing British correspondent tips his hat to the country and people he once ridiculed . <p> WE EUROPEANS ALL KNOW AMERICA , DO N'T WE ? It 's the land of the ignorant , cowboy president and shopping malls inhabited by the morbidly obese . A place where blacks are represented by sleeping lawyers before being condemned to death and elections are stolen or rigged . <p> In the U.S. of A. , criticism of the White House is considered treasonous . Pickup trucks with Klansmen at the wheel and gun racks in the back fill the roads . Workplace gripes are routinely settled by shooting sprees . Brainwashing begins with the Pledge of Allegiance in kindergarten . <p> Americans can not place Europe on a map and most do n't have passports . Rabid Christian fundamentalists control the government and much of the country . Either the insidious " Jewish lobby " or rapacious oil companies dictate foreign policy . <p> A ludicrous caricature ? Of America , certainly . But during four years of living in America , I have heard each of these charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Satan . America , or their notion of it , is truly hated by a majority of opinion formers  --  and the vitriol filters down into their populaces . <p> Hollywood bears much blame for exporting so much that emphasizes the bizarre , the extreme , the excessive , the unrepresentative about America  --  Michael Moore being the most celebrated current export . <p> Publishers in Blighty like nothing more than an American who knocks America . Scanning the shelves of Books Etc. in London 's Fleet Street  --  once the home of our newspaper industry  --  this fall was profoundly depressing . <p> What is being offered to the great British public ? As well as Moore 's latest money spinner , there was Rogue Nation : American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions , by Clyde Prestowitz ; Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace : How We Got to Be Hated So Much , by Gore Vidal ; The Great Unravelling : From Boom to Bust in Three Scandalous Years , by Paul Krugman ; and a cartoon book called Weapons of Mass Deception . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many Britons base their views of American politics on The West Wing , a portrayal of the White House that Hollywood wants , complete with a super-clever , verbose , quotation-loving , irredeemably liberal but sexually continent president and Republicans who stop just short of eating babies for breakfast . <p> The result is a fairground mirror version of the country I have lived in and grown to love over the past four years . <p> Driving across America with my 16-year-old brother recently  --  an exhilarating , enthralling and exhausting three-week trip covering 26 states and 7,896 miles to California and back  --  I pondered this place about which my fellow countrymen seemed to know so much and yet understand so little . <p> Before I set off , I reread a diary I had kept during the last coast-to-coast trip , on Greyhound buses , that I had made as a student in 1989 during my first transatlantic visit . Another president called Bush had just taken office , though my callow attitudes had been shaped by endless chatter in Britain about an ignorant , cowboy president  --  sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Statue of Liberty , I sneered , was spoiled by " a lot of typical U.S. rhetoric about protecting freedom and democracy . " Universal Studios in Hollywood " epitomized all that is bad about the States  --  packaged , contrived , corny , expensive and mindless . " <p> Even the World Trade Center provoked my ire . " The preoccupation in the States with having the tallest building in the world seems to say so much , " I sniffed . " Everything must be the biggest and the best . " I probably thought I was being clever at the time ; in reality I was parroting the comfortable old clichs that are a substitute for real thought . <p> A dozen years later I was in Washington watching television on deadline with tears streaming down my face , as office workers  --  male and female , black and white , many Americans , some not  --  leapt to their deaths from those tall buildings . <p> A short distance from the Telegraph bureau , White House aides were being told to run for their lives after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon , unbelievably , was hit . <p> When I finally went for " lunch " at 8 p.m. , 11 hours after the first plane hit New York , the face of Barbara Olson , the first member of the public to be named as a victim , flashed up on ABC television . <p> I knew her , initially from American Spectator dinners . The day before her untimely death , I had put off writing a thank you note for a small kindness she had shown me . The calmness and bravery she displayed in the last moments of her life still inspire many Americans . <p> EVEN BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11 , my view of America had altered fundamentally . I had begun to see patriotism ( a dirty word in Britain ) and the conviction that anything is possible ( which jars with the negativity I grew up experiencing ) as signs of strength and self-reliance rather than arrogance and shallowness . <p> On that day , I had little doubt Americans would cope , principally because they loved their country . Despite their many differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains today , they believed in the idea , the ideal , almost the emotion , that is the United States . What unites the country is so much stronger than what divides it . <p> More than two years on , there is still an electronic sign above the Pennsylvania Turnpike , which passes close to the site where Flight 93 , intended to hit the Capitol in Washington , was brought down by heroic passengers . It reads : " United We Stand "  --  a statement of fact rather than an exhortation . <p> The attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon turned Americans into combatants in the war on terror . No one who was here on September 11 sees the world in the same way , but most European leaders  --  Tony Blair is an honorable exception  --  have failed to grasp either how Americans were affected that day or what that meant in foreign policy terms . After the obligatory period of mourning , they reverted to type . <p> Driving from Ground Zero , through the Amish Country of Pennsylvania , by Graceland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 27th anniversary of the death of the King , and into the majestic landscape of Valley of the Dead in Utah , the remarkable variety of America constantly hit me . <p> How could all this be compressed into a one-dimensional stereotype ? The roadside ubiquity of McDonald 's , Applebees , Cracker Barrel and Arby 's notwithstanding , this was not a place of homogeneity but a mosaic of extraordinary intricacy . <p> Since 1999 , I have reported from 47 states and visited two others , Utah and Maine . My apologies to Rhode Island , though I did spend several days with you during a port visit with the Royal Navy a decade ago . <p> I have interviewed steel workers in West Virginia , chased cactus rustlers in Arizona , attended black church services in Alabama , eaten whale in Alaska , discussed the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammad with a CIA man wearing a dress and black lipstick , and smuggled a toilet into North Dakota . <p> Along the way , I picked up speeding tickets in Kentucky , Ohio , Colorado , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a warrant for my arrest in the Lone Star State , which has never been easy on lawbreakers . <p> Despite the conventional wisdom in Britain that debate in America has been suppressed , in fact it has seldom been more vibrant . Crossing the country , I was accosted by people expressing their views , many highly critical of Mr. Bush , almost daily . <p> Within the Bush administration , an ongoing debate over the fundamental conduct of foreign policy has raged for nearly three years . British diplomats at the United Nations would feel sorry for American diplomats because after marathon Security Council negotiations they had to go back and do the same thing all over again in Washington . <p> Talk radio  --  what Dick Armey once described to me as " the voice of freedom "  --  and Fox News compete with the liberal-hued networks and big-city newspapers for the minds of citizens . Bloggers fill in the gaps . <p> The discussions can be frustrating . I sometimes think the American view of balance is having two nutcases from opposite extremes screaming at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any case . <p> Of course , not everything about America is wonderful and there is an element of truth in some of the most common accusations . Cell phone reception is appalling , road signs are awful , telemarketers and automated phones drive me to distraction . <p> I have also been shocked at how , in the land of the free , petty officials enforce the most ridiculous rules and citizens meekly obey . While I was visiting Mount Rushmore , a National Park ranger gave me a $50 ticket for leaving my dog Finn ( an Irish-American mutt , soon to become , like Senator John Kerry , Irish-American-Jewish ) tied up outside for half an hour . Okay , maybe I should observe speed limits . <p> The Drive Thru window and All U Can Eat buffet have indeed taken their toll on the girths of Americans . I confess that my brother and I had shared what we called " fat American moments "  --  a look from one was all that was needed to provoke stifled giggles from the other as some humungous human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a three-scoop ice cream with all the toppings . <p> Equally , though , many Americans are obsessed with physical exercise . Formerly a bit of a porker myself , I have become caught up in the marathon bug ( my farewell to D.C. was doing the Marine Corps Marathon ) . <p> And running has given me yet more snapshots of American variety . During the Army Ten Miler  --  a " hoo aah " event if ever there was one  --  I ran behind one competitor with a shirt proclaiming " Peace Not War " while another had " Bring Our Troops Home Now " emblazoned on his back . Pretty brave considering half the competitors were active duty military , but they were treated with nothing but politeness . <p> On the Virginia side of Key Bridge  --  on the return leg of a favorite route of mine  --  an American flag was painted after September 11 . One week it is daubed with a peace symbol and doves instead of stars ; the next it will be back to being just the stars and stripes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baucus ( D-MT ) , an accomplished marathoner who voted for the Iraq war . Shortly afterwards , a sign declaring " Peace is Patriotic " appeared in his window . <p> It had been put there by his wife , Wanda , who gave an interview to the Washington Post in which she said she was dead against the war . Among the reasons she cited was her fears for the camels ( how did the camels fare , I wonder ? ) . Was her peacenik statement condemned or ridiculed ? It passed virtually without remark . <p> There are justifiable doubts in Europe about the fairness and efficacy of the death penalty . But the issue is seldom examined in depth . Even a Conservative member of Parliament and Shadow Cabinet member told me over a gin and tonic in the bar of the Willard that executions stemmed from a " red-neck mentality " in the U.S. <p> He seemed unaware that only a minority of states resort to capital punishment and that it usually takes more than a decade of appeals before sentence is carried out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that ordinary Europeans , like Americans , were in favor of the death penalty he simply refused to believe me . The " problem , " therefore , is an excess of democracy and devolved power in America ( many of the 2000 election difficulties flowed from this ) . <p> America is routinely condemned as being a racist society . Yet no black Briton has risen to the rank of Secretary of State or National Security Adviser . The United Kingdom has no black generals or admirals . <p> WHEN I WAS WALKING MY DOG in Georgetown 's Montrose Park the other day , a bizarre woman berated me for letting the shaggy beast off the leash , as virtually every other dog owner in the area does every day of the week . As I waved her idiocy aside , she screamed at me : " Where are you from ? Go back to wherever you 're from . " <p> The encounter astonished me because this was not the kind of sentiment Americans express . Everyone here is an immigrant or a generation or two from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're all of us from somewhere else . <p> The belief that anything is possible permeates every sector of American society whereas in Britain the insidious influence of class holds people back like invisible threads . <p> Even I , as the son of an architect and educated privately before attending Dartmouth Naval College ( the British equivalent of Annapolis ) and Oxford , can be looked down on as a pleb in certain company in England . I have come across nothing like this in the U.S. <p> America had little choice but to rise to the challenge September 11 presented . But acting decisively has , perhaps inevitably , stirred the embers of anti-Americanism once again . America is condemned as an imperialist power  --  if she had done nothing , of course , the charge would have been isolationism . <p> Most dangerous is an emerging " counter-Americanism , " the doctrine that America is to be stopped , its goals frustrated and a counter-balance to the unipolar superpower created . This must be stopped at all costs . <p> My fellow Europeans need reminding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . Opposing America means opposing the universal values , the seeds of which were exported from Europe . <p> President George W. Bush has many fine qualities as a president but he has needlessly antagonized allies , often as much by his dismissive manner as by the substance of policy . <p> Many of his staff treat all members of the press as the enemy . Working for a conservative newspaper from America 's staunchest ally gave me slaps on the back from ordinary Americans but precious little access to the Bush administration . Even taking the extreme step of trying to date Vice President Dick Cheney 's press secretary failed to land me an interview . <p> Because loyalty to Mr. Bush is seen as the number one attribute of an administration official , there is a tendency to appoint yes-men or women who have little policy or life experience to important jobs . This can result in a brake on creativity that does not , ultimately , serve the president well . <p> The diplomacy that accompanied the Iraq war and its aftermath has been sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the saintly Colin Powell who gets the blame for this ) . Despite the huge achievement of toppling Saddam Hussein , aspects of the post-war phase have been muddled and uncertain . <p> None of this , however , justifies the tendency of so much of the rest of the world to define itself by the ways it is against America . <p> Mr. Bush once said that he did n't " do nuance . " His fondness for seeing things in terms of black and white or good and evil encourages those who want to sniffily dismiss Americans as crass and simplistic rather than attempt truly to understand . <p> But nuance , as I realized after I put my student days behind me , should work both ways . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Toby Harnden <p> <p> Toby Harnden , formerly the London Daily Telegraph 's Washington bureau chief is now the newspaper 's Middle East correspondent based in Jerusalem . <p>
