MARANA , Ariz.  --  A deafening roar returns today to the tranquil world of professional golf  --  and for the sport , it arrives not a moment too soon . <p> Tiger Woods , the world 's No. 1 golfer and a megawatt global star whose participation in a tournament can mean millions more TV viewers and incalculable buzz for the sport , returns to competitive golf for the first time since his epic victory in the U.S. Open last June . <p> When he tees off in the Accenture Match Play Championship here , just north of Tucson , Woods will end an eight-month break that followed reconstructive surgery on his left knee  --  the longest interruption in his 13-year career . <p> Woods layoff felt even longer for the PGA Tour , the organization that operates the main professional tournaments in the USA . <p> Television ratings , ticket sales , media coverage and general interest in golf have declined significantly since Woods was forced to miss the second half of last season and the first 20% of 2009 . The Tour remains on solid financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial sponsorship agreements for about 20 tournaments whose deals are set to expire in 2010  --  including 10 from the battered automobile and financial services industries . <p> U.S. Bank , for example , has announced it no longer will sponsor the Tour 's stop in Milwaukee after this year . Also , on Tuesday , when the Tour announced an agreement with Accenture to extend its sponsorship through 2014 , it also revealed that FBR Capital Markets will cease sponsorship of the Phoenix stop after 2010 . <p> Meanwhile , Tour officials are pursuing new sponsorship deals with companies in the energy , retail and environmental industries to try to make up for a potential exodus of sponsors . <p> Since Woods , 33 , limped away after his third U.S. Open win , 14th major championship and 65th Tour victory , the Dow Jones industrial average has plunged from a closing of 12,269 that June day to 7,351 on Tuesday . Gone are billions of dollars in Americans wealth  --  and some of the disposable income that helped golf flourish during Woods rise to stardom . <p> Even Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million last year  --  was stung by the downturn : In November , General Motors ended its 10-year , $70 million endorsement deal with him a year early . <p> In Woods absence , TV ratings plummeted for the remaining two of the Tour 's four major tournaments last year : down 55% for the PGA Championship , which Woods had won in 2007 , and down 11% for the British Open . Irishman Padraig Harrington won both majors in Woods absence . <p> In September , BMW Championship ratings were down 61% in the final round from 2007 , when Woods won . This year , ratings for the Buick Invitational were down 53% in the final round from 2008 , when Woods won . <p> Most tournaments do not release attendance figures , but the crowd at last year 's AT&amp;T National near Washington , D.C. , was down 32,000 from a year ago when Woods played there . Officials at this year 's Buick Invitational said ticket sales were down 15% to 20% from 2008 . <p> Now , however , Woods could be a one-man bailout for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations efforts . <p> " Everybody knows that when the world 's No. 1 athlete plays , we have more eyes watching the broadcast , more headlines and more attention , " Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem says . " Tiger spikes everything . For us to have Tiger back after such a lengthy absence is special . " <p> ' This is a huge boost <p> For Woods rivals , his absence represented a chance to win tournaments without competition from the sport 's best player . But they  --  likely mindful of how the increased attention Woods has brought to the sport has helped make many players richer  --  seem as thrilled as Finchem that Woods is back . <p> " He 's carried this Tour , and this is a huge boost , " says Kenny Perry , who won two tournaments during Woods absence . " I joke with him every time I see him , asking if he needs me to park his car or carry his luggage . With the economy down , we need something to boost us up . And there 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't quite that many , but Tour officials have issued credentials to more than 530 journalists , including crews from NBC News , ABC News and CNN . More than 100 members of the media greeted Woods on the driving range just after 7 a.m . Tuesday . <p> Also on hand is the golf broadcast team from NBC , which begins its golf telecast season this week and covers the next five tournaments leading up to The Masters in Augusta , Ga . <p> " To be able to feature America 's arguably greatest athlete is a godsend , " NBC Sports President Ken Schanzer says . <p> Says NBC on-course commentator Dottie Pepper : " He brings the casual viewer back . There 's a buzz he creates that is just not the same as with anyone else . " <p> Woods is aware of the potentially serious troubles facing the Tour , where purses have risen from $80.5 million his first full year in 1997 to $280 million this year . He knows Finchem has called 2009 a challenging year for the Tour , which needs corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finchem even took the unprecedented step of sending a video to players urging them to add events to their schedules and increase their interaction with sponsors and fans this year . <p> Woods seems mindful that interest in pro golf has faded despite the rise of young , popular stars Anthony Kim , Sergio Garcia and Camilo Villegas , but he seems taken aback by the notion that he is looked upon as a one-man stimulus package . <p> " The only thing I can control is my play , " he says . " The Tour is obviously feeling it , just like any other part of the business world . I think it is very important for all of us to understand how important the sponsors are to our sport . ... We may be losing a few tournaments , and a lot of tournaments are coming up on their contract years . This is a very important year . " <p> The best remedy for pro golf would be for Woods to stride into the winner 's circle again . <p> The last time that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Open , where the swelling in his left knee was so bad at night that he could n't see his kneecap . But with two strong legs for the first time in years  --  after surgeons removed a tendon from his right thigh and made it his left knee 's anterior cruciate ligament , cleaned up some cartilage damage and helped heal a double stress fracture in his left tibia  --  Woods could be better than ever . <p> That 's saying something . He won 10 of his last 13 tournaments worldwide before the surgery and did not finish worse than fifth during that stretch . <p> " I want to become better than I was , and this ( surgery ) will help me in that process , " Woods says . " I feel a lot stronger in my left leg . Both legs have been stronger than they ever have been . <p> " Stability is something I have n't had in years . So it 's nice to make a swing and not have my bones move . I did n't think it would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery because I had n't known what it 's like to feel this way . It 's been so long . So to have it feel this healthy and this solid and secure , it 's a great feeling . " <p> Woods began hitting short irons in December and progressed to playing every day for the past month , hitting every shot without pain in his knee , he says . Even so , having played just one tournament in 10 months , Woods is concerned about rust and is n't sure what to expect during his return . <p> " I 'm as curious as you , " Woods says . " The feeling of adrenaline , the rush of competing and playing again , all that I have n't done in a while . " <p> Could he be better ? <p> His colleagues , however , know what to expect . <p> " Logic suggests that he is going to take awhile to get back into it , because no real person can take eight months out of competition and come back ready to go right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But logic has never really been anywhere near Tiger . He 's still going to be Tiger Woods . " <p> Adds Harrington : " I actually think he 'll come back better . When something is taken away from you , you want it even more . " <p> Woods swing coach , Hank Haney , also expects improvement . <p> " Anybody who thinks Tiger 's not going to be better than ever does n't know Tiger , " says Haney , who began coaching Woods in March 2004 . Woods has won six majors and 25 Tour titles since . <p> " Tiger has not been able to hit a practice ball after a round of golf since the ( 2007 ) British Open . For the first time in years , Tiger is practicing pain-free , and he is able to hit more balls . It is amazing that Tiger has been able to perform at such a high level in a game that takes so much mental strength while he was in the amount of pain that he was in . I ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help his game . " <p> Woods return event , however , could last just one day for him . Match play pits two players against each other in an elimination match , and scoring is based on winning a hole . <p> Woods could be ousted in the first round ( tee time 2:02 p.m . ET , Golf Channel ) by Australian Brendan Jones and never make it to the weekend , when NBC begins coverage . Or he could make it for two 18-hole matches Saturday and the final 36-hole match Sunday  --  meaning he could play as few 10 holes or as many as 126 . <p> Woods has n't decided where or when he 'll play after this week . <p> " I 've got to take this tournament by tournament , " Woods says . " I do n't know how this thing 's going to behave in a competitive environment and how the recovery is going to be day-to-day . " <p> His good friend , golfer Mark O'Meara , expects Woods to once again be the best golfer in the world . Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his batteries . <p> Woods and his wife , Elin , also became parents a second time when Charlie Axel was born this month . And during his layoff , Woods spent time reconnecting with his daughter , Sam Alexis , born in June 2007 . <p> " I did n't realize how much I loved being home and being around Sam and E and now Charlie , " Woods says . <p> He also hosted his golf tournament in southern California in December , filmed commercials , attended Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games and Orlando Magic basketball games , and spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during President Obama 's inauguration celebration . <p> " In a roundabout way , this has been a good thing for Tiger , " O'Meara says . " I think he 's going to come back better than ever . I think you 're going to see some pretty phenomenal things . That 's just my opinion , and I can be wrong . But most of the time with Tiger , I 've been right . " <p> Find Documents with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
