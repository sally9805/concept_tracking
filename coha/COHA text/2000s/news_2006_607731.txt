<p> Adrian Hanauer 's job was seemingly impossible . The sports entrepreneur had only 16 days to sell enough tickets , at an average price of $60 , to fill a 67,000-seat NFL stadium in Seattle for an exhibition soccer match between D.C. United , a Major League Soccer team playing almost 3,000 miles from home , and Real Madrid , the Spanish power that has struggled in recent years despite its all-star cast of players . <p> But when the teams enter Qwest Field tonight , the Seattle soccer official 's success will be evident . About 59,000 tickets had been sold as of yesterday and Internet sites were selling them for more than $290 . <p> It helped that Real Madrid is one of the richest and most iconic soccer clubs in the world , with a New York Yankees-like roster that includes superstars  --  known among the club 's millions of fans as " Galacticos "  --  David Beckham of England , Brazil 's Ronaldo , Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and Italian defenseman Fabio Cannavaro . <p> " They are one of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen play , " said David Carter , a principal in the Sports Business Group , a Los Angeles sports consultant . " It 's the history of the Dallas Cowboys with the recent performance of the Boston Red Sox and the notoriety of the Los Angeles Lakers . " <p> United is the most successful team in MLS 's 11-season history , with four titles and 17-year-old Freddy Adu , who has drawn crowds wherever he has played . <p> " Freddy Adu has never been in the Northwest and he will be a big draw himself , " said Hanauer , owner of the minor league Seattle Sounders soccer team , which plays at Qwest and draws about 4,000 per match . <p> Before the deal was signed , Hanauer stipulated that Real Madrid bring its best players to Seattle , and most of them will be on the field tonight . At the same time , he had directed his staff to put an aggressive ticket-selling plan into place . It included calling Sounders season ticket holders and sponsors first to see if they were interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public relations staff launched Hanauer on a day-long media blitz designed to lead the television news and capture the front pages for that news cycle . <p> " We knew that if it was done right , the editorial side of newspaper and TV and radio was going to be our best form of advertising , " Hanauer said . " If they thought this was a big deal , we were going to sell a lot of tickets . " <p> The result : 47,000 tickets sold in the first three days . <p> Adidas , which pays Real Madrid $25 million a year to wear its merchandise , began touting the game at its Seattle store and is entertaining dozens of corporate guests and employees . The shoe giant sells more than 1 million Real Madrid white jerseys a year , according to a company spokesman . <p> Beckham did his part . The worldwide soccer idol had helped sell out the Seattle stadium in five hours when Manchester United , whom he then played for , visited Seattle in 2003 . Hanauer and his staff were in immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beckham and other Real stars were put in a television studio for video promotions that have aired in Seattle . Adidas sells 300,00 Beckham jerseys a year . <p> " David Beckham is one of the biggest sports names globally , " said Chris McGuire , sports marketing manager for Adidas soccer <p> Real Madrid 's two-game tour , which includes another match Saturday in Utah against Real Salt Lake , follows successful U.S. tours by other high-profile European soccer clubs over the last decade , including Juventus , AC Milan , FC Barcelona and Manchester United . <p> The game against Salt Lake was planned for months , but Real Madrid decided to add another game in North America after the team decided a planned visit to South America was too far if the club wanted to get back to Spain and be ready for its season . Real Madrid and United considered the East Coast of the United States , but there was a conflict with the Nationals at RFK Stadium . <p> Another option was to play at Camden Yards , but MLS did n't want Real Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is scheduled to play in Giants Stadium against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday . Toronto was also considered . <p> " We would have much rather played in this market for a whole host of reasons , but MLS asked us to play on the West Coast , " United President Kevin Payne said . " They were concerned it would seem disrespectful to Barcelona to have a game down the road featuring their arch rival . " <p> Real Madrid , founded in 1902 and the most storied club in Spain , is estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth more than $1 billion . But the club , which is owned by its 100,000 members , in recent years has been overshadowed on the field by Barcelona . The teams have a long history of enmity dating from the Spanish Civil War , where Real was considered to be the club representing the monarchy and Generalissimo Francisco Franco 's fascist seat of government , while Barcelona was identified with the Catalans and rebels . <p> So Real headed west for its " friendlies , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States to be close to the fans , which means putting the best team on the field and playing the game at the highest level , " said Ivan Bravo , Real 's international development manager . " If we continue to increase our fan base , that increases value to our sponsors . " <p> Real , which commands around a $1 million fee plus expenses , is a marketer 's dream . Though it does n't have a big U.S. presence , it still drew 54,000 people to Chicago 's Soldier Field last summer for a game against Chivas of Guadalajara , Mexico . During the same trip , Real also sold out its match against the Los Angeles Galaxy in eight days , including drawing 8,000 people who paid $30 apiece to see the club practice . <p> Payne said Real has wisely rationed its exposure to the U.S. market , adding mystery and more excitement to the club . Like other major globetrotting soccer clubs , Real has also capitalized on the worldwide expansion in sports broadcasting and merchandising . Adidas has 2,000 stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the team embarked on its expensive strategy of cobbling together the best offense in the world , including attackers such as Beckham ( $30 million salary ) , Ronaldo ( $15 million ) , Zinedine Zidane ( $19 million ) , Raul Gonzalez Blanco ( $15 million ) and Luis Figo ( $12 million ) . The Galacticos helped Real Madrid overtake Manchester United as the highest-grossing club in the world with revenue last year of $350 million , according to an annual business study of soccer teams by Deloitte Football Money League . <p> " There 's a real magic to Real Madrid , " Payne said . <p> But some of the magic has been lost on the field . The policy spearheaded by former president Florentino Perez , who resigned earlier this year , failed to bring the club a major trophy since its Spanish league title in 2003 . Real has n't won the European Champions League , which it has won nine times , since 2002 . <p> Perez 's successor , Fernando Martin Alvarez , and new manager Juan Ramon Lopez Caro may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zidane , who famously head-butted an Italian counterpart in the World Cup final , has retired . Figo was recently transferred . But Real has added more offensive firepower in Nistelrooy , Beckham 's former teammate at Manchester United , as well as Cannavaro , formerly of Juventus . Payne said that the addition of the defender Cannavaro signals a commitment to more balance between offense and defense . <p> " They made a classic error and forgot the first principle of why they exist , " Payne said . " That is to win on the field . "
