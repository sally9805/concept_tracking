WINTERTHUR Like many collectors , Henry Francis du Pont ( p. 154 , Pl . I ) had a fascination with American arts , which started in the early 1920s when he and his wife , Ruth Wales du Pont , built a large weekend residence , Chestertown House , in Southampton , New York , and began decorating and furnishing it . Having grown up at Winterthur amid dark , baronial , Victorian and European furniture , du Pont had appointed their New York City apartment with French and English antiques . But a 1923 visit to the Shelburne , Vermont , home of Electra Havemeyer Webb ( 1888-1960 ) , and a subsequent visit to Beauport , the weekend retreat of Henry Davis Sleeper in Gloucester , Massachusetts , fixed his mind upon the acquisition of American objects for his seaside retreat.1 Chestertown House , an enormous brick structure overlooking the dunes and the ocean , had large rooms for entertaining , cozy rooms for contemplation , and numerous bedrooms for weekend guests.2 When du Pont began this project , he is reputed to have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the furniture I know .. is new . Since we 're Americans it 's much more interesting to have American furniture . " 3 Hence , as the house was being constructed between 1924 and 1926 , du Pont voraciously began buying American antiques . In 1924 alone , he purchased a total of 226 pieces of furniture and many other objects . These were all itemized on the 137 invoices he received from a wide variety of dealers . Being greatly impressed with Sleeper 's taste and collections , du Pont sought his assistance , for he was both a trained architect and a practicing decorator . Consequently , many of du Pont 's early purchases focused on furniture made of pine , maple , and other light woods ; painted and decorated objects ; and windsor chairs , hooked rugs , pottery , painted tin , and ironwork . The tone was definitely comfortable colonial revival ( see Pl . II ) . While the main drawing room contained some of the most stylish urban pieces , including du Pont 's great Newport corner chair , the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs with rush seats.4 Much to the dismay of today 's textile curators , du Pont even upholstered his easy chairs with quilts and coverlets to give them an early American aura ! Painted furniture figured prominently in the decor of Chestertown House , and by the end of the 1920s du Pont had already assembled a significant collection of Pennsylvania German arts that he continued to add to over the next five decades . Pennsylvania dealers like Hattie Brunner ( 1889-1982 ) in Reinholds , A. H. Rice in Bethlehem , and Francis Brinton ( 1877-1961 ) in West Chester were among the many people who offered him objects . In Decem. her 1926 , Rice advertised in The Magazine ANTIQUES a collection of eleven pieces of Early Furniture ... collected by me personally in Remote Sections of Pennsylvania " to be sold as a lot for $7,300.5 The advertisement pictured " No.1 Desk with Birds , Stars and Horses " ( PI .

" Rice 's offer as a lot was effective from December 1 , 1926 , to January 1 , 1927 . Thereafter , Rice advised his public that " Pieces Will be Sold Separately . " Whether du Pont expressed any interest in these pieces in 1927 or 1928 is unknown , but in December 1929 , Rice wrote to him , " Sending under separate cover photos of Penna Dutch painted desk and Bureau the only two pieces of this type of furniture left . " 7 Rice offered both pieces at a bargain price of $700 but said he would sell them separately , for $350 each , " delivered to Winterthur . " Du Ports keen eye and penchant for painted furniture resulted in the purchase of both pieces . Although they went to Chestertown House for a time , they eventually came to Winterthur .

The view illustrates the budding collectors penchant for painted Pennsylvania furniture , windsor chairs , and hooked rugs . From the beginning du Pont favored the installation of elements of period architecture , just as Henry Davis Sleeper ( 1878-1934 ) had done at Beauport in Gloucester , Massachusetts , and various museums were then doing in the creation of American period rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

V One of the rooms at the Girl Scouts Loan Exhibition held at the American Art Galleries , New York City from September 25 to October 9 , 1929. // On December 31 , 1926 , H. E du Pont 's father died , which appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious scale . With the passing of " the Colonel , " as his father was known , du Pont inherited Winterthur , and was able to change its interior furnishings and enlarge it to hold his own growing American collection . Already in October 1926 , before his father 's death , he bought one of his most expensive and significant high style pieces - an " Antique Sideboard " that he acquired for $12,000 from the New York City dealers Collings and Collings . Typically many invoices of that period provide little or no description , but judging from the price and the limited number of sideboards du Pont ever acquired , this must be the magnificent New York example ( Pl . IV ) that has graced the Du Pont Dining Room at Winterthur for many years . Mr. and Mrs. Collings became a major source for some of du Pont 's finest acquisitions , often acting also as purchasing agents at auctions and with individuals . In January 1929 , du Pont paid one of the highest prices that he had spent to date when he bought from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cupboard " for $35,000 . This was no doubt the superb Middlesex County , Massachusetts , example that he lent nine months later to the Girl Scouts Loan Exhibition in New York City discussed below.8 The purchase that truly called public attention to du Pont 's extravagances was his winning bid of $44,000 for the famed " Van Pelt " Philadelphia high chest from the Howard Reifsnyder collection in April 1929 ( Pl . III ) . This set an auction record as the highest price paid for a piece of American furniture . Not surprisingly , du Pont was determined to keep secret the items he had purchased at this sale . In April 1929 , as Louis Guerineau Myers ( 1874-1932 ) began to plan the Girl Scouts Loan Exhibition for the following fall at the American Art Galleries in New York City , he invited du Pont to join the sponsoring committee , which he did . In May , Myers asked du Pont about possible loans . Since Winterthur was then about to be greatly enlarged , du Pont responded : " all my mahogany pieces are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . I shall be enchanted to lend you any of the things that are in storage . " He went on , however , to remark in a rather perfunctory manner : So far as the Reifsnyder highboy is concerned , I announced that no one should know what I was going to buy at that sale , and I have adhered strictly to it ever since . It might be possible that during the summer I would let you know what things were acquired by me , in which case you could select the ones you wish to exhibit . All this , however , depends very much upon the outcome of some furniture deals I have been negotiating for some time.9 As it turned out , H. E du Pont was the single largest lender to the exhibition , but the Reifsnyder high chest was not included . He also was responsible for the installation , attested to by Myers 's reply to him on August 26 , 1929 : " I am also tremendously uplifted to hear from Mrs. Harry Benkard 18771945 that you will arrange the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a tremendous success if you can produce some of the effects of your own home . " 10 Du Pont replied a week later , " My understanding about this arrangement , however , was that I would help Mrs. Benkard to arrange the exhibit , as I think she has much better taste than I have , and naturally I shall be very glad to be of any assistance I can in the matter . " 11 Exactly who was conning whom into taking the lead is unclear , but the galleries of the exhibition were certainly in the du Pont taste ( see Pl . V ) . The Girl Scouts Loan Exhibition had brought du Pont into contact with numerous collectors , and his association with Myers proved particularly advantageous . In January 1930 , Myers offered du Pont a number of pieces of his that had been in the 1929 exhibition . The transaction ultimately included fourteen pieces of furniture and nine pieces of pewter , for a total of $48,700.12 Perhaps the most significant object was the labeled Honore Lannuier pier table ( Pl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Montmorenci Stair Hall at Winterthur.13 Also from Myers were eleven pieces then attributed to Duncan Phyfe ( 1768-1854 ) , most of which were eventually installed in the Phyfe Room in Winterthur . In April 1931 , just as the Winterthur addition was completed and all was installed , du Pont invited Louis and Florence Bragg Myers ( 1871-1951 ) to visit . Illness prevented Mr. Myers from traveling , however , and he died the following January without ever seeing the objects from his collection in place . Myers must have been gratified , though , by du Pont 's note to him on May 1 , 1931 : I have only been in the house three weeks now , but thanks to the wonderful assistance of Mrs. Benkard , it looks as though we had always lived here and I think you mill approve of our arrangements , etc .... Your Phyfe looks beautiful and I must say that for a long while I could not see Phyfe . Its charm , however does grow on one more and more as time goes on.14 As early as 1924 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whom he acquired numerous superb pieces of furniture . Years later , in 1953 , he recalled in a letter to Sack , When I was in college in 1901-02-03 , 1 remember going into your shop many times ... . Unfortunately I did not start collecting my American furniture until some twenty years later and there is no telling how much better a collection I might have had if I had started with you at that time.15 While it might be difficult to choose a favorite piece from the many that came from Sack , du Pont was quick to place his vote in the same letter in 1953 , as he recalled the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the diminutive Boston tea table shown in Plate VI : One of my favorites is the little Queen Anne mixing table with its dish top of grey marble and candleslides at each end . That piece , you may remember , you telephoned me about during the height of the Depression and when I said I was out of the market you answered : " I shall bring it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minute I saw it , it was a " must " 16 One of the other major forces in du Ports collecting adventures was Joe Kindig Jr . ( 1898-1971 ) of York , Pennsylvania . In 1926 du Pont began acquiring objects from this noted dealer , starting with what he listed in his Day Book as a " John Elliott Mirr " 17 for $200 . Over the next few decades Kindig often brought objects to Winterthur , acted as du Port 's agent at auctions , and observed the progress of du Port 's collecting . As different as these two men were , they shared an affinity for the beautiful and rare , and Kindles early admiration of du Pont came through clearly in a letter he wrote following a visit in 1934 : Dear Harry , I felt like I probably stayed too long yesterday but I hated to leave as I knew how I would fed As usual it got me the same way . Harry you certainly know how to live . You have made a real art out of it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but your knowledge of what is just right . A great deal of this knowledge you have acquired by observation and study but a lot must be inherent good taste . You are just a few years older than I am but in your knowledge you are generations ahead of me . I am afraid this is what makes me feel bad or blue.18 Although many of the pieces of furniture that du Pont acquired from Kindig were great Philadelphia high-style objects , one of the collectors finest Rhode Island block-and  --  shell pieces also came through him . What is even more interesting is that this imposing Providence chest-on-chest ( Pl . X ) had been offered to du Pont twice before in 1939 , first by the Pomfret , Connecticut , dealer Ella Boult ( 1868-1951 ) and just weeks later , presumably by Israel Sack . Photograph PL VI .

Du Pont bequest . // On August 7 , 1939 , du Pont briefly responded to Bouts letter by saying , " I am sorry I can not use the Goddard block front high chest which you describe in your letter of the third instant . Thank you just the same for calling it to my attention . " 19 Later in the month Sack went to Connecticut to see the chest in the house of Mrs. John R. Gladding ( 1857-1939 ) , and he wrote to du Pont : " In my opinion , the block-front chest-on-chest with the nine shells is one of the rarest and most unique pieces of furniture of the Rhode Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasing this piece since 1931 , when he had corresponded about it with a Franklin H. Arnold of East Greenwich , Rhode Island . ) Du Pont responded to Sack by mid-September . I agree with you that whether the chest-on-chest is Goddard or not does not make the slightest difference if it is a beautiful piece .... am simply turning it down because the two little rooms in which I have my Goddard furniture are too small to take such a big piece.21 By this date du Pont already owned three pieces of Rhode Island block-and-shell furniture-a six-shell desk  --  and-bookcase and two bureau tables.22 Then , in December 1944 , du Pont paid Kindig $12,000 for for this chest  --  on-chest . Exactly how it came into Kindig 's stock and what changed du Pont 's mind about having room for it are mysteries . Fortunately for Winterthur , however , the chest serves today as an important Providence counterpoint to the typically Newport block-and-shell pieces in the collection.23 Since H. F du Pont 's death in 1969 , the Winterthur Museum has continued to collect in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's objective as a major teaching institution and resource for collectors , dealers , and students , has been to focus on established strengths in building the collection as well as broadening them for points of contrast and comparison . In some instances , there is evidence that du Pont had been in search of specific forms or objects ; in other cases curatorial discre tion has prevailed . For example , the 1993 acquisition of a most significant East Windsor , Connecticut , high chest ( Pl . VIII ) attributed to Eliphalet and/or Aaron Chapin , added a regional form heretofore not represented.24 The chest was acquired directly from descendants of an early owner . Retaining its original pediment cartouche and pierced brasses , the high chest presents an apt comparison to the Philadelphia high chests du Pont admired so much and which clearly inspired the Chapins in the design and proportions of their chest . In the 1950s , du Pont began to write instructions to his executors regarding how his estate and museum should be handled after his death . In a few instances , he noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended adding to the collection . One of the many collectors whom du Pont had come to know and admire was Charles Krum Davis ( 1889-1968 ) , the president of Remington Arms Company , a subsidiary of the DuPont Company Occasionally Davis came to Wilmington for directors ' meetings , and he visited Winterthur sev eral times in the 1940s at du Pont 's invitation . In 1948 du Pont visited Davis at his home in Fairfield , Connecticut , and in 1952 , at the suggestion of the Winterthur director , Charles F Montgomery ( 1910-1978 ) , he appended a note to his instructions to executors : From the Charles K Davis Collection , I feel , we should plan to get , if ever available , the following pieces : 1 - William and Mary slate top table illustrated This is one of the most refined and probably finest of this type New England table and is not represented in the Winterthur Collection.25 Although this table never came to Winterthur , the fact that du Pont had wanted a superior dressing table with an imported , ornately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquisition of the diminutive slate-topped dressing table shown in Plate IX , which entered the collection in 1998 .

Following a visit to Winterthur in 1948 he penned a fitting tribute : You have done and are doing Magnificent work in perpetuating the finest craftsmanship and mode of life in early America , and I feel sure that both present and future generations owe you a debt of gratitude for your wonderful accomplishment . I came away feeling that I had been privileged to witness the greatest collection of its kind in the world.26 Today , Winterthur continues to inspire generations of collectors and scholars with its incomparable collection and commitment to excellence .
