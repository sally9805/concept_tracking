Did controversial super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff create a popular Washington restaurant just to make friends and influence people ? Signatures , his gourmet trattoria on Pennsylvania Avenue , was renowned as a high-class feeding trough for politicians . Indeed , as Capitol Hill circulates a purported comp list from Signatures that includes eight Congressmen , TIME has obtained an e-mail showing that Abramoff offered a complimentary meal to a longtime ally who , like him , is in a lot of ethical hot water these days . His message , headed " Tom and Christine DeLay " and addressed to restaurant staff , is dated May 2 , 2002 , when Tom was House majority whip , and requests that a table be set for six and the meal " comped . " <P> " We can find no record that this meal took place , " a DeLay representative told TIME . " All restaurants comp patrons , and Signatures is no different , " says a spokesman for Abramoff . Reps for both men note that House rules allow old friends to pick up dinner tabs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eatery gave out meals worth only about 7% of its revenues  --  just above the national average of about 5% . But because his lobbying drew FBI and congressional scrutiny earlier this year , patrons have stayed away . As a result , restaurant-industry sources tell TIME , Abramoff is close to inking a deal to sell his once profitable restaurant to  --  surprise !  --  more Washington bigwigs.
