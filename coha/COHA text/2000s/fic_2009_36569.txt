Usnavy was an old man . Not in age so much-he had turned fifty-four that year-but he was born old , his childhood brow prematurely molded into an expression of permanent concern , his gait , even as a youngster , as labored as if he 'd been instantly injured on the job , both in spirit and in fact . His pale gray eyes sat in his mushroom-brown face , common and faded , even in boyhood , as if they 'd never twinkled or delighted with wonder or awe . <p> All that summer of 1994 , Usnavy had manned his post at the bodega-the one where people came with their ration books to have their monthly quotas of rice and beans and cooking oil doled out-and wordlessly shook his head when people pointed to a page for an item they should have received but which he did n't have to give . His eyes darted over the void on his side of the counter : soap was scarce , coffee rare ; no one could remember the last time there was meat . Sometimes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peas used to supplement beans or , when ground up , used as a coffee substitute . <p> Now and then , when the shelves were particularly bare , he would find himself involuntarily thinking about Belgian chocolates , the kind his mother used to crave : in a box , each nugget tucked into a white paper nest . He imagined giving such a box to his wife , Lidia , and watching her and their fourteen-year-old daughter , Nena , laugh as they shared the sweets , their fingers dotted with cacao peaks . Nothing brought him greater joy than their pleasure ; nothing affected him quite like his daughter walking beside him , her fingers laced with his . <p> At the bodega , Usnavy knew he should n't be partial with what was available . He needed to weigh it out and pour it into the bag for whomever got there first-but Usnavy tried to hoard the bulk of it , just in case , for the most needy : the solitary elderly and the young mothers with kids like kittens clawing at their hems , frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea on toothpicks , desperately trying to reach other shores for better luck . After a windsurfing instructor from Varadero had illegally managed the waves all the way to the Florida Keys in little more than nine hours , scores of young men were now seen erecting homemade sails on boards all over the coasts , feigning interest in things like barometric pressure and practicing their skills walking on water . <p> Usnavy stared at those leaving in disbelief . He wanted to tell them that fate was not in a shoreline or a flag , but in a person 's character . Yet to confront the windsurfers and other mariners meant dealing with the fierceness of their desire-and even Usnavy understood that if the blinding light bouncing off the mirrored waves did not obscure their focus , there was nothing that would keep them from seeing what they wanted to see . They were , each and every one , like Christopher Columbus , insistent on a mainland filled with promise , no matter the truth of the island . <p> After the morning shift , when the sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family 's Old Havana apartment on Tejadillo street , a windowless high-ceilinged room , no bigger than one of those bloated American cars . Concrete on all six sides , Usnavy 's room in the tenement distorted daylight and time but remained relatively cool throughout the worst of days . A picture of a young Comandante hung in a frame , their only decoration but for a poster of the American singer Michael Jackson , which Nena had gotten as a gift from a friend down the street who 'd left for the United States a few years before . <p> Besides the bed , there was a folded cot , where Usnavy slept so Lidia and Nena could be more comfortable , and a tiny table with a Czech-made electric plate he 'd received from the Prague-born wife of a Cuban friend when they had hurried back to her country after the communists tumbled . Next to the plate was a small , white , Soviet refrigerator . Usually , Lidia 's old American iron-much coveted , since irons of every lineage had virtually vanished in the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean towel . <p> There were books all over the room too , on homemade shelves , tucked under Nena and Lidia 's bed in neat rows , and usually in piles next to it as well . Not just Nena 's school books but also books about Africa , poetry books , books with ambiguous endings by Jorge Luis Borges and Chester Himes ( beautifully translated into Spanish ) , and a young Cuban writer named Leonardo Padura , one of Usnavy 's recent favorites , whose work had been published in Spain and Mexico . <p> On the wall behind the door , there were a pair of hooks on which Usnavy hinged his bike , his only means of transportation and one of the few things over which he and Nena had occasional arguments . About this , Usnavy was intractable , refusing to surrender his one chance at relief and escape . His official excuse for refusing to let her borrow it was that he could n't risk the bike being stolen from her . But in his thinking , she did n't need a bike : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capitol building . Of course , Nena was a teenager now and naturally restless . She wanted to be out , to go , anywhere . In his heart Usnavy understood it would be better if she had her own bike , but he simply could n't afford it . So as much as he hated to think about it , she 'd have to continue walking to get around , hitchhiking like everyone else , and taking the bus , which he knew was often hours late , crowded , and a source of other kinds of dangers too . <p> Sometimes , he knew , the bus did n't show up at all . Since the scarcity of fuel had forced the government to cut public transportation service down to bare bones , Lidia , a hospital taxi driver for more than twenty years-one of the first women to really excel at the job-had been laid off and now just shuffled around Tejadillo in a faded housedress most of the time , stunned if not bitter , not because she 'd lost her job but because younger men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " They have family , " Usnavy had tried to explain to her . <p> In the first few months of her layoff , the government had given Lidia a good chunk of her old salary in compensation , but after she 'd taken a reeducation course in arts and crafts her take-home pay had been dramatically and embarrassingly reduced . Though she was licensed now as an artisan , there was no paper , no ink , no paint , nothing . The two or three practice prints she 'd made in class of Che Guevara and views of dawn in the tropics were smears of color , indecipherable , and long since shredded for note taking and other more intimate uses . <p> Now , whenever Usnavy tried to rationalize things for her , Lidia bit her trembling lip and looked away , refusing to make eye contact with him , leaving him frazzled and frail . <p> To relieve the gloom , the family 's room-a breadbox , a shoebox-was illuminated by a most extraordinary lamp . Were it not for the sheer size of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neighbors . Made of multicolored stained glass and shaped like an oversized dome , the lamp was wild . Almost two meters across , the cupola dropped down with a mild green vine-and-leaf motif that flowered into luscious yellow and red blossoms , then became a crimson jungle with huge feline eyes . ( In truth , they were peacock feathers , but Usnavy had never seen or dreamt of peacocks , so he imagined them as lions or , at least , cats . ) The armature consisted of branches at the top , black and fat to resemble the density of tree bark . They narrowed as they neared the edge , until they were pencil thin and delicate . The borders were shaped with the unevenness of leaves and eyelids , petals and orbs , in a riotous yet precise design . <p> Because Usnavy lived in the old colonial district , in a tenement carved out of a nineteenth-century mansion with twisted and enigmatic electric wiring that refused to respond to a central command , while the rest of Havana-in fact , the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family never lacked the glow of his majestic lamp . <p> The lamp had traveled with Usnavy from his hometown of Caimanera , the closest Cuban town to the American military base at Guantnamo Bay and the reason for his unusual name : Gazing out her window at the gigantic military installation , Usnavy 's mother had spied the powerful U.S. ships , their sides emblazoned with the military trademark , which she then bestowed on her only son . She pronounced it according to Spanish grammar rules- Uss-nah-veee - and for a while caused something of a stir , which other young mothers soon imitated so that by the time the Revolution was upon them , there was a whole tribe of sturdy young Usnavys in Oriente . ( In the 1980s , during the Soviet boom in Cuba , there was another inexplicable surge of English-inspired names , particularly Milaydy , Yusimf- You-see-me - and Norge , after the refrigerator company . ) Usnavy-the original one : Usnavy Martfn Leyva-was born in 1940 , shortly before Pearl Harbor , when the U.S. might have been thrown off balance but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their mortality-recklessly throw themselves into love or revolution . Perhaps as a result of all that , Usnavy carried with him a kind of guilt : At one time , it was possible his mother had loved the enemy ( in all fairness , they had n't been seen or understood , exactly , as the enemy then ) , had aspired to the enemy 's might , had tried to project onto him their sense of possibility and optimism . <p> His father-as Usnavy had been told , a Jamaican laborer ( a poor schmuck , he had surmised ) - had disappeared into the sea , leaving his mother a widow shortly after he was born , free to rearrange the past at will and dream about the future . <p> Usnavy remembered her in the radiance of that marvelous lamp-a rush of light in a splendid drawing room at a house called The Brooklyn , where important men sat for hours and chatted and smoked while swaying on colonial-style rocking chairs . They played cards and talked of vital things in many languages , like drilling for oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhino noses , lion pelts , and elephant tusks , prizes taken from the Serengeti , the stolen home of the Maasai . All the while , a young Usnavy hovered about in the margins , dizzy from the cigar smoke and the buzzing voices . He imagined himself not a hunter or a stateless native , but one with the beautiful beasts , feral and unbound . As each tale of adventure unfolded under the glorious lamp , Usnavy would feel his heart racing , as if absorbing the shock of the shot , from the depth of his guts to the tangle and blockage in his throat . He 'd cough and gag until it passed , his mother stroking his young , blondish locks in a contained panic . The men just drank their whiskey , passed bills among themselves , and signed papers . <p> Usnavy had a memory of his mother as a charming presence , young and tender in the glow . When she moved to Havana many years later , he was comforted to see the lamp in her possession . The luminescence kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of her as old , as if the crone whose features served as the only model for his own was a neighbor instead of his mother . She hovered in his peripheral vision , as tantalizingly close and out of reach as a promise . Her burial was a favor he executed for someone he was only remotely connected to , an act of charity meant to ameliorate her aloneness and prove that , in Cuba anyway , no one died without the benefit of community . At his mother 's passing , the lamp was Usnavy 's only inheritance , which he accepted like a reward for exemplary revolutionary work . <p> In the damp and acrid tenement , the lamp was a vibrant African moon in a room that was by nature spectral . It was delicate and oversized in a place that demanded discretion and toughness-if it swayed , it might shatter against the concrete . But Usnavy insisted on displaying it . <p> " What good does it do packed away ? " he 'd asked Lidia ( as if storing it somewhere else were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's so lovely . " <p> Lately , he knew Lidia fretted because their upstairs neighbors-in violation of both the law and logic-had built up from their second floor room , adding another whole tier for themselves on the roof . Using bricks scavenged from the many edifices that had crumbled in recent times , the neighbors had nearly doubled their space , but the weight of the new construction was taking its toll . In Usnavy 's room , the ceiling already had small cracks , and Lidia had spotted a line of water yellowing the plaster , circling the spot where the lamp was attached . She had tried talking to the neighbors but they dismissed her worries . And when she mentioned it to her husband , he just nodded , never quite registering her concern . <p> " I 'll talk to them , I promise , " he 'd tell her , but he seemed to regard his lamp as invulnerable , and the talk with the neighbors kept dropping on his list of things to do until Lidia became resigned to the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only preoccupation seemed to be , as always , maintaining the lamp 's cleanliness and shine , polishing it as if it were a piece of treasure dug up from the sea . <p> Lidia would stare up at him , as if about to ask something : Her lips would part slightly , quiver , then close again . <p> Usnavy would stand barefoot on the bed where Lidia and Nena slept and reach up and rub each of the little glass panels with a silk cloth guaranteed not to streak or scratch . A couple of the panels had hairline fractures ; Usnavy knew they could pop with the slightest push and he was especially gentle around them . <p> At night , he kept the light on until the last possible second , engaged in a never-ending staring contest with the lamp 's feline eyes . Sometimes , especially when she was younger , his daughter Nena would curl into the curve under his arm and join him , imagining all the possibilities within the lamp 's vast offerings . That , she 'd say , aiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fertile Nile traversing the continent , and that , he 'd point out in the opaqueness of a tiny triangle , the whirling sands on the beaches of Madagascar . <p> But these days Usnavy was on his own . Now Nena would bury her head under the sheet , ignoring Africa-ignoring him-and sigh loudly and repeatedly until Usnavy finally pulled the lamp 's cord and darkness imploded . <p> * * * <p> Outside the door of their room in the tenement , Usnavy and his family had a big metal barrel of water which he guarded zealously with a lock and chain , and which they used by filling a plastic bottle or bucket and carrying that to the bathroom in the middle of the courtyard , a swirling funnel of flies shared with the rest of the tenants ( now too numerous to count ) . The water was hard , almost metallic , swimming with so many invisible parasites that it was imperative not to swallow even when brushing one 's teeth . Everything had to be boiled , the steam rising in the tropical heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no light in the bathroom except what came in through a broken window where the local boys would lurk and peek , so that at night it was essential to carry the fortitude for argument and a torch made from rolled-up newspapers . ( Flashlights and candles had long disappeared from Havana . ) Sometimes in the dark , Usnavy would imagine breaking off a part of the lamp-a lump of fiery orange and red , one of those brilliant eyes-and using it to light his way instead . <p> What struck Usnavy most these days was how many strangers suddenly surrounded him . Not that long ago , he knew everyone who lived on Tejadillo . But in the last year , at least thirty people had left , mostly young men , a few young women-all of them by boat or balsa , wobbly and dangerous . Their rooms were instantly taken over by supposed relatives from the provinces-large , overflowing families , with dozens of kids and so many cousins . They sometimes brought roosters with them , small pigs , a goat once . <p> For Usnavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his original neighbors . He could n't keep all their names straight . He could barely tell them apart . Worst of all , what had once seemed to him like a safe harbor , now struck him as alien and claustrophobic , a pirate 's cove . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
