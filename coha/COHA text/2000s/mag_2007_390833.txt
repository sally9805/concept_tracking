This exhibition includes eye-popping models , paintings , and textiles , along with other cultural objects from around the world-ranging from shadow puppets to Japanese armor-that bring to light surprising similarities and differences in the ways various peoples have been inspired by nature to envision and depict these strange and wonderful creatures . " This exhibition extends the . . . traditional examinations of the natural world and human cultures to explore how nature fuels creativity in people around the world and across time , inspires fear or whimsy , and even influenees belief systems , notes Ellen V. Futter , president of the American Museum of Natural History . " Mythic Creatures " is highlighted by four main sections : Creatures of Water examines the kraken , sea monsters , mermaids , and other beings that inhabit the depths of the open ocean and give form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arouse feelings of curiosity and hope , but also fear . When European explorers set out on voyages of discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , sea monsters were a concern and frightening rumors ran rampant . Sailors ' tales often were th only firsthand information about ocean animals and stories ranged from accurate observations to honest mistakes to outright tall tales , with no way for even the most objective naturalist to separate fact from fiction , Stories of sea monsters often incorporate features from living animals , like the half-human , half-fish mermaids . Creatures of Land features beings that walk the Earth . Many of these creatures appear to have body parts from ordinary animals combined in unusual ways , Some experts believe that the legends of the griffin , an extraordinary creature combining the eagle and lion , originated in the sands of the Gobi Desert some 2,000 years ago when Scythian miners stumbled upon the fossil remains of the four-legged , beaked dinosaur Protoceratops . Other creatures look like familiar animals , but have extraordinary and magicalpowers , such as the European unicorn , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Asian unicorn , which differs from its European counterpart by having a scaly coat , one or multiple flesh-covered horns , and a wolflike head . The enormous bones of mammoths , mastodons , and woolly rhinoceroses found by ancient Greeks may have inspired tales of giants , while bones of fossil dwarf elephants-their large trunk opening in the middle of the skull may have been misinterpreted as a massive , single eye socket-might have done the same for the Cyclops . Creatures of Air explores winged mythological beings such as the Asian phoenix , a mythical bird that appears at times of peace or to announce the birth of a virtuous emperor . Some 700 years ago , Arab traders told of a bird so huge it could lift an elephant into the sky ; sailors said it lived on an island off the southern coast of Africa . In fact , the over-nine-foot-tall Aepyornis-now extinct-once lived on the island of Madagascar . This section also examines the tengu , a goblinlike creature that lurks in the forests of Japan , mocking and punishing prideful people ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a giant , birdlike divinity in Hindu and Buddhist stories that fights its eternal enemy , the snakelike Nagas ; and Pegasus , the famed winged horse of Greek mythology The Dragons section examines the reptilian beasts with fabulous powers that claim a mythic presence on at least three continents . In European stories , dragons are powerful , wicked , and dangerous . Some nest in caves , guard stockpiles of treasure , and devour sheep or even young girls . The dragon sometimes has been feared in the Christian world as the image of evil . In many stories , a dragon dies by the sword of a brave and honorable hero , ending a furious battle between sin and virtue , darkness and light . Legendary dragons of East Asian cultures differ from the European variety . In Asia , they have sweeping powers , including breathing clouds , moving the seasons , and controlling the waters of rivers , lakes , and seas . In the Americas , the Aztecs worshiped the god Quetzalcoatl , or " feathered serpent . " This dragonlike creature was linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of the planet Venus , and often had the sharp fangs , fiery gaze , and winding body of a snake-and the deep green feathers of the quetzal , a tropical bird .

Sidebar Dragons perhaps are the most popular and fascinating of all mythical beasts . Interestingly enough , the timeless legends of their overwhelming size and incredible powers differ depending on which continent-Asia , Europe , or North and South America-the tales originate from . Sidebar The original " Feejee mermaid " ( top ) , made famous by RT . Barnum more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed in a fire , although some are convinced this one ( rediscovered in 1973 ) may be it . Meanwhile , coppersmith Warren Gould Roby carved this wooden weathervane in the mid 180Os . It is considered a classic American expression of the feminine beauty of the mermaid . Unicorns are among the creatures whose origins may be rooted in a case of mistaken identity , as fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals oftentimes were misinterpreted by previous cultures . The griffin is legendary for its body of a lion and head and wings of an eagle . It was thought to be especially powerful and majestic since the lion is the king of beasts and the eagle is king of the air . Chupacabra means " goat sucker " in Spanish and the creature acts much like a vampire , killing animals by sucking their blood . Alleged modern-day sightings have been made by farmers in Puerto Rico . Enormous apes are more than a myth . This massive creature , called the Gigantopithecus , is an extinct primate - a very distant relative of humans that lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as recently as 300,000 years ago . The Roc was an enormous bird so powerful that it purportedly was able to carry elephants and other large creatures back to its nest where they would be devoured . The Roc appears in one of the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor of Arabian Nights fame . <p>
