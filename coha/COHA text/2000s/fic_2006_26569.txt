My name is Robbie Brownlaw , and I am a Homicide detective for the city of San Diego . I am twenty-nine years old . My life was ordinary until three years ago when I was thrown out of a downtown hotel window . No one knows it except my wife , but I now have synesthesia , a neurological condition where your senses get mixed up . Sometimes when people talk to me , I see their voices as colored shapes . It happens when they get emotional . The shapes are approximately two by two inches and there are usually between four and eight of them , sometimes more . They linger in the air midway between the speaker and me , about head high . They fade quickly . I can move them with my finger or a pen if I want . Shortly after my fall I used graph paper and colored markers to make a chart of which words and word combinations triggered which colored shapes . This was time-consuming and not always pleasant , due to some very painful headaches . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker . Red squares came from a deceptive one . Green trapezoids usually came from someone who was envious  --  green really is the color of envy , just like we were always told . But as the weeks went by , I noticed that identical words and sentences couldsometimes trigger very different shapes and colors . I was afraid that I had posttraumatic swelling in my brain and worried that my synesthesia would worsen to the point where I 'd spend the rest of my life drooling at invisible shapes while people tried to talk to me . I spoke my fears to Gina one night and noticed that when she told me I " should n't worry about it , " her words came to me as the black triangles of dread . I looked them up on my chart just to make sure . It was then that I began to understand that the colorful shapes are provoked by the emotions of the speaker , not by the words themselves . So I have what amounts to a primitive lie detector , though I 'm not certain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool me , or even an accomplished liar . Who knows what colors and shapes they might cause ? In my line of work , people will lie to you about the smallest and most trivial things . Synesthesia is considered a gift by synesthetes  --  the people who have it  --  but I 'm not convinced that it is . There 's a San Diego Synesthesia Society , and for over a year now I 've been thinking about going to a meeting . I browse their Web site and note the date and time of the next meeting , but I 've never attended one . I 'm curious , but a little afraid of what I might discover . The condition is hard for me to talk about , even with Gina . Although she 's tolerant and wonderfully opinionless about how others view the world , it annoys her that even her white lies announce themselves to me as bright red squares . It would annoy me , too . When I was thrown out of the window I hit hard . You have no idea how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six stories up , even if your fall is largely broken by a canvas awning . During the fall I came to believe in God . It is true what they say about your life flashing past when you believe that you are about to die , but it is not your entire life . Obviously . I should have died , but only a few bones broke , and I 'm in perfect shape again , other than the large scar on the back of my head , now hidden by hair , and the synesthesia . One benefit I got from that fall was two very quick promotions . As soon as I proved I was in great health and could do the job , doors opened right up . From Fraud to Sex Crimes to Homicide just like that . Everyone expected me to die from the fall . All of the media coverage made the department want to reward its unlikely hero . The reporters nicknamed me " the Falling Detective . " And my superiors sincerely felt that I deserved a little something extra for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest detective in Homicide , but nobody seems to resent me for it . I 'm part of Team Four . Our case-cancellation rate last year , 2004 , was eighty-eight percent , which is considered excellent . I got the call from our lieutenant at four that morning . An anonymous caller had tipped us to a body in a car near Balboa Park . Patrol had confirmed a black Ford Explorer parked in the trees near the Cabrillo Bridge , which spans Highway 163 . The lieutenant told me there was a man slumped dead in the driver 's seat . Blood , sidearm on the floorboard , probable gunshot . I called my partner , McKenzie Cortez , then poured a cup of coffee . I sat for a minute on the bedside in the dark , snugged up the sheets around Gina and kissed her . In the weak light of the breakfast nook I wrote her a note saying I 'd be careful and I loved her . Spouses worrying about their loved ones getting killed on the job is what ruins a lot of cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wake up to . She works as a hairdresser at Salon Sultra downtown , which is top of the line . She cut Mick Jagger 's hair when the Stones played L.A. not long ago . Just a trim , actually . Mick flew her up to his hotel in Beverly Hills in a helicopter . Paid a thousand for the cut and gave her another five hundred for a tip . The drive from my house in Normal Heights took twelve minutes . It was a cool , clear March morning . There had been rain the night before , more than enough to leave shallow black puddles along the freeway . The stars were bright in the sky and the . . .
