<p> Standing forlorn outside his girlfriend 's locked dormitory late one night , Kristopher Simon decides to call . With no phone nearby , he pulls his laptop computer out of a backpack and surfs to " dialpad.com . " A click on her number relays a radio command from a flickering wireless modem to a relay box in the dorm ceiling and into Buena Vista University 's new wireless Internet server - which then shoots the request into the phone network . Mr. Simon holds his laptop and its microphone up to his lips and speaks . " Hello ? " answers a disembodied female voice . It 's just one small , spontaneous social event made possible by America 's " first wireless community " in higher education . <p> Earlier this year , virtually every inch of this 60-acre campus was linked wirelessly to the Internet . Every student and faculty member was assigned a new laptop computer with wireless modem . Now , whether in class , lunchroom , or on the shores of nearby Storm Lake , students and faculty are hooked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 650,000 for the network . " It 's all part of what we 're trying to be - the best new American college , " says Kenneth Clipperton , managing director of Buena Vista information services . A " ubiquitous " computing environment will enable more and better learning , he says , while admitting that " a leap of faith " is involved . Wireless-enabled laptops , combined with a wireless Internet network , hold the promise of transforming American higher education by giving all students instant Internet access wherever they are on campus , he and other advocates say . Students can also have ready and frequent interaction with their professors - not to mention the freedom to tap resources anytime , anywhere . But not everyone is convinced the step is a good one . Along with quick access to academic resources comes the ability to play games constantly , surf the Web in class , and talk online to friends instead of seeing them face to face . Lost in the newly " instant " culture may be time for contemplation , or even unwired solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between " sprocketheads " and " Luddites , " with one person smashing an old computer . Even some students are dubious , concerned about cost and the impact on academic life . " Will we all turn into vegetables and become computer addicts ? " asked a recent editorial in the campus paper . " Have we become noncreative , unthinking individuals who only want to be entertained ? " <p> The jury 's still out Nearly 100 colleges and universities nationwide have " laptop initiatives , " but only about three dozen make it mandatory for all undergraduates to have laptops , according to Ellen Chaffee , president of Mayville State University in North Dakota who tracks them . Of the few true " laptop institutions , " some have put parts of the campus on a wireless system . Only tiny Buena Vista University , with 1,250 students , seems to have gone all the way with wireless . Yahoo ! , the Internet service , ranked it the nation 's sixth " most wired " among its peers . But will the wireless-Internet-laptop campus prove to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Wireless technology has a long way to mature before we see a widespread move by many campuses , " says Brian Hawkins , president of EduCause , a Washington-based organization focused on technology in higher education . " How much outdoors computing do you really need ? " Mr. Hawkins says that his son " sits with his computer on a sculpture . Is that really the reason we 're in the education business ? What is the relative advantage ? " But junior Justin Isbell says there is one - several , actually . He lugs his seven-pound laptop , festooned with decals , to nearly all his classes . He takes notes on it , reads e-mail from professors and classmates , writes papers , and searches catalogs . Sometimes he files homework from his dorm room at 2 a.m . He can play " Baldur 's Gate , " an adventure game , on it - or listen to music files . In a pinch , his laptop is the " next best thing to a cellphone , " he says with a smile . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones , a senior , chats with friends present at the table - and those who are not - through a powerful instant-messaging program . You have to watch though , she warns . A laptop was sent for repair because a student spilled jello into the keyboard . Leaving the lunch room , she has her open-and-running laptop cradled under one arm . Then , reaching across with her free hand , she responds to a message - while also walking and chatting with two friends . " I just find it easier to keep it on , " she says . " I 'm always prepared for class and I 'm in touch , too . I love it . " <p> What happens in class ? But where the controversy really flares is in debates about wireless computers ' impact on the classroom . As expected , they have made classes more active - but not always in intended ways . " Some were skeptical about whether this would be just another toy in students hands , " says Todd Travaille , an assistant professor of writing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around campus common areas , by the lake and in class - people are working on them . " He acknowledges that sometimes he suspects students in his class may be checking their e-mail rather than typing notes . Indeed , in one business classroom , a lecturer expostulates about marketing while several students send e-mails and one surfs the Internet to the Smithsonian , where he spends the rest of class clicking on modern art . But on a recent day , Mr. Travaille pops his laptop into a docking station and begins critiquing an essay by one of six students in the advanced writing class - projecting his computer document on an overhead screen . Students can also follow on their laptops . " We can have this continual exchange , " he says . " It means my classroom is more dynamic . Students can communicate with each other and collaborate in a way that 's not time dependent . " Travaille 's classes are all paperless . Students attach their assignments to an e-mail . Travaille opens it , makes comments , saves a copy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a big part of the appeal . In fact , computer labs that used to be jammed are now deserted . " It 's really good to have the computer , " says Aaron Mahr , a senior English major in Travaille 's class . " I use it in almost all of my classes to take notes . I can sit at home or anywhere . " Still , he says , " I think because of it I do n't see as many people as I used to - I talk with them online instead . Sometimes I feel I 'm losing that personal touch . " He 's uncertain about the impact on the quality of his schooling . " I do n't know if I 'm getting a better education , " Mr. Mahr says . " It 's costing a little more in tuition . I do know I 'm more marketable in the workforce because I use a computer all day . " But there 's a darker side , according to Ellen Larson , a senior majoring in philosophy and religion . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she really likes it - up to a point . " I 've gone back to writing out notes because I feel more in sync with the class , " she says . " In one class I sit next to people who surf the Web and send e-mail . You can see it as techno-doodling . " In that class , she says , everyone was solitary and " the screen was a barrier . " Finally , the professor had everyone shut their laptops . As soon as they did , the discussion started , she says . Sitting outside on a late-fall day , Greg Morris is teaching his social research statistics class . One of the last warm days of the year is mixed with academics , courtesy of the wireless network . Flexibility and students with serious computing power at their fingertips are important to Morris . " It 's one of the biggest reasons I decided to come here two years ago , " he says . " It 's the future . " <p> E-mail claytonm@csps.com . <p> ( c ) Copyright @ @ @ @ @ @ @
