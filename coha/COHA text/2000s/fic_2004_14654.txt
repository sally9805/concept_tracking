A WOMAN in a crowded restaurant , standing at one of those tall tables . A bunch of food in front of her , and she is quietly eating it . By the way , she 's a plus size . Very .

She looks over at him without saying anything . Silence . HELEN My hair color . ( Beat . ) What do you think ? TOM Oh , I see . ( Smiles . ) Sure HELEN It 's not a huge deal  --  I was just mentioning it . TOM Yeah , but HELEN You get used to it .

HELEN People are capable of most things you can think of . That 's what I 've found , anyway TOM I suppose . HELEN At some point they do n't really seem to care about your face . The MAN looks around , trying to see if there 's any other spot for him . She glances at him . HELEN You can eat here if you want . TOM No , I do n't need to , umm HELEN What ? TOM I du n no , I had n't really thought the rest of that one through ! Ahh , " intrude , " I guess . HELEN You 're not . I made some room for you before , when I saw you there . TOM You sure ?

That 's what I think HELEN Really ? TOM Of course . I mean HELEN So , do you really like sprouts or does that only hold true for me ? Your little theory there TOM No , I 'm just I had a really big breakfast , so I 'm HELEN That 's a lie . TOM Ahh , yeah . Yes , it was . You saw through that one Damn , you seem pretty good at this ! HELEN What , the truth ? TOM Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too bad at all . The MAN checks around once more , then takes up a spot at the table . They both get down to some serious eating . p. 6 HELEN You work nearby ? TOM No I 'm just up here for this meeting . Usually I eat downtown . ( Beat . ) And you ? HELEN Yes , I 'm over at the library . The MAN nods and points at a plastic bag on the table . TOM Ahh , cool yeah , I saw the bag earlier . Thought maybe you just stopped by there or HELEN Nope .

Pulls a few out . Library emblem on each case . TOM The Guns of Navarone , Where Eagles Dare Ice Station Zebra ? HELEN I threw myself a little Alistair MacLean festival . TOM Huh . Do n't get me wrong , because I love that stuff , but that 's not very " girlie " of you . HELEN You 're probably just dating the wrong kinds of girls . They share a smile and a chuckle . The MAN reappraises her . TOM No doubt about that  --  I ca n't even call ' em " girls " without getting hit by a lawsuit , so ( Grins . ) You 're a librarian ? HELEN Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , ahh TOM Sure , of course ! It 's probably , like , " printed-word specialist " or something now , I suppose HELEN Exactly . ( Beat . ) They 're always coming up with new names for stuff . " Garbage man , " that kind of thing . Something to make that person feel better a " refuse technician " or what have you . p. 8 TOM That 's so true HELEN Right ? Problem is , you still find yourself picking shit up off the street , no matter what they call you ! I mean you know He laughs at this , and she joins in . The MAN studies her . TOM You have a terrific laugh . HELEN Thanks . TOM You 're welcome . A potty mouth , but a really cute laugh HELEN That 's sweet , thank you ! ( Laughs . ) Huh . That 's one of those , umm TOM What ?

Just so you know HELEN I 'm glad . ( Beat . ) Now that I 'm so self-conscious that I 'll never do it again TOM Exactly ! They smile at each other and then do n't know what to say next . They decide to take bites of their meals instead . HELEN How 's that spinach coming along ? TOM Mmmmmmmm so darn good . HELEN I bet . TOM Yeah . Yummy .

HELEN And you do n't ? TOM Ahhh open for debate . HELEN Really ? TOM I mean you know , if I really had to come up with one , for , say , the big guy upstairs or whatever , I 'd probably do something like " does not run with scissors " or one of those . " Plays well with others . " p. 11 HELEN Really ? Handsome guy like you and that 's all you 're good for to look at ? TOM Pretty much . HELEN Good to know . ( Opens a pudding . ) You want one ? TOM Nah , I should n't HELEN Why ? TOM Excellent question . Okay He takes a tub of rice pudding from her and digs in . HELEN Good ? TOM Mmmmmmm wonderful . Have n't done that in ages . HELEN What ? TOM Enjoyed myself . Like that . Put something in my mouth without reading the back label like some Bible scholar He gives an example  --  holding the pudding up to the light as if it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles . This makes her laugh again . A lot . TOM All right , okay , we 're gon na have to ask you to leave You 're actually enjoying yourself during the workweek . HELEN Right ! Sorry TOM No , I told you , I love your laugh . It 's okay . p. 12 HELEN Thanks . Again . TOM You 're welcome HELEN So no other good qualities , huh ? TOM Ahhhhh , I suppose . Faithful friend and co-worker , dependable , takes directions well . HELEN What about good lover ? Not on the list ? The MAN stares at her , glances around . She keeps looking right at him . TOM That 's very direct HELEN Librarians are funny people . TOM I guess I shouldn't 've let my card lapse ! HELEN No , look what you 've been missing . TOM Yeah . HELEN So ? TOM Ummm I 'm okay . I mean , no reports of absolute dissatisfaction , but I do n't think I 'm , like , Valentino or anything . HELEN You mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was n't he like this big Latin lover or something ? HELEN I guess that was the story He died really unhappy , though . I 've read his biography . p. 13 TOM One of the perks of the job HELEN Right ! I 've read just about every biography in the place , actually . Real people interest me . I do n't really have much time for fiction . TOM Cool HELEN Anyway , you do n't have to answer the question . It was rude . TOM No , I I mean , I sort of did . HELEN And you 're what ? Just okay ? TOM Something like that I do fine . Wow . I 've never been asked that before . In that way . HELEN No ? TOM Not at lunch , anyhow ! ( Beat . ) It 's kind of invigorating , actually . You seem like a really I do n't know . An interesting person , I guess . They laugh together again . Really enjoying themselves . HELEN You should swing by the library sometime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat . ) Listen , I 'm I need to get back to the office . Downtown . HELEN All right . Sorry if I was p. 14 TOM No , no , it was but could we I du n no what I 'm asking here . Should we see each other again ? HELEN Why ? TOM I du n no I mean , I 'm just , it 'd be good , I think . You seem really nice and I 'm what can I say , I 'm just asking sort of outta the blue . So , could we ? ( Beat . ) I 'm not trying to pick you up or anything , I just HELEN Too bad . ( Smiles . ) Yes . We should . TOM For lunch ? Or , ummm , dinner ? HELEN I do n't only eat . I can be coaxed into doing other stuff , too TOM Of course ! I did n't mean HELEN I know . It 's a joke . TOM Right , sure I 'm really striking out on the humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) So when ? TOM Anytime . HELEN How about Friday ? I 'm good for Fridays , my day off . TOM Ummm , yeah . Evening . HELEN Great . p. 15 She reaches over and takes a pen out of his shirt pocket and writes her number down on the side of a napkin . HELEN Now when you wipe your mouth you 'll think of me TOM Good plan . ( Beat . ) So , okay , library lady , I 'll call you HELEN Helen . My name 's Helen . TOM As in " of Troy " ? ( Groans . ) That was so lame , sorry HELEN Right , the thousand ships and all . But that was just so they could carry me back He stands there , thinking about this . Does n't get it . HELEN because it would take that many to lift me Do n't worry about it . TOM Oh , I see . ( Laughs . ) I got it ! HELEN Yeah . Just trying to be cute . TOM No , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , though . Make fun of yourself so much . HELEN Why not ? TOM Ummmmmm I 'm sure there 's a very good reason . I 'll get back to you . HELEN You do that . You 've got the number there p. 16 TOM Right . I 'll call you . And I 'm Tom , by the way . HELEN I 'll see you . Tom . She wanders off with her tray and her bag . TOM stands alone . After a moment , she returns . Walks right up to him and gets close . HELEN So , look , I figure there 's every reason why I 'll never hear from you again , I mean , besides the obvious one That 's why I came back here , just to say that I do n't do this , come after guys or anything , not like some regular habit or whatever , so I thought you should know that . I think you 're really cute and nice and that sort of thing you might have a girlfriend already or not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would , but I really do hope you call me . Just even to talk on the phone would be fine , because I 'd like that , if we were only these phone buddies or whatnot I think I would . Just do n't be afraid , Tom , I guess that 's why I came back here , to say that . Please do not let yourself be afraid of me or of taking some kind of blind chance , or what people think because this could be so nice . I mean , really , really very much so . ( Beat . ) Okay , that ends this portion of my embarrassing story , and I will slowly wander out of here . Maybe just pretend like I did n't come back and do this , all right ? I think that 'd probably be best She smiles at him and does what she promised : wanders out of the joint . He watches her go , waves when she nears the door . TOM goes back to eating the pudding and then looks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly folds the napkin up and pockets it. @x TOM at his place of work . Busy doing something . Another guy enters , carrying some files and a cup of coffee . He throws himself down in a chair . His name is CARTER . CARTER So you 're not gon na tell me , right ? Anything else , I mean . TOM No , I 'll you know CARTER Uh-uh , no , you wo n't . I know you . TOM That 's not true , I always tell you crap ! All kinds of crap about me . CARTER Yeah , but not the good stuff that I wan na hear . The dirt . TOM I do n't have dirt CARTER Everybody 's got dirt ! We 're dirty , us folks . Very dirty . TOM Who 's " us folks " ? CARTER People . You and me-type people . TOM It 's not this is not some nasty thing that I 'm trying to keep from you . Seriously . CARTER Okay then , so ? ( Beat . ) And by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty childish . TOM breaks into a big grin . CARTER follows him , and they share a good chuckle . p. 19 TOM Oops . ( Smiles . ) Anyway , this is just it 's new , that 's all . I do n't know what it is yet , so CARTER So , like I said , you 're not gon na tell me shit . TOM Kinda . Yeah . CARTER Fine . I do n't care . TOM Bull you 're dying to hear . CARTER Yes , but I 'll wait . I 'll hire some private eye or whatnot , find the scoop that way . Get the Hardy Boys involved . Whatever it takes TOM Come on I just wan na see what it is first . If it 's worth talking to anyone about or not . CARTER Okay , now you 're frightening me TOM What ? CARTER I do n't like it when you get all serious ! Then it 's like girlfriend city , and that 's scary . TOM It 's not scary CARTER This is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a lady friend , and he drops off the map , I know how this one works TOM I 'm not at all like that ! CARTER Yes , you are p. 20 TOM No , uh-uh . If anybody is , you are . CARTER Yeah , but that 's for good reason . I 'm actually having sex with them . TOM Very funny . CARTER Seriously . TOM Shut the hell up ! I have sex CARTER Uh-uh , " oral " does n't count . And especially not for somebody who thinks it means talking a person to death TOM Hooooo funny ! ( Beat . ) Are you in here for an actual reason ? CARTER Pretty much . I do n't remember what it is , but I 'm sure I had one when I started down the hall TOM Perfect . CARTER Oh , yeah , now I recall . Because I was bored in my office ( Beat . ) Plus , you have nicer windows . TOM Feel free to open one and jump CARTER You are so clever ! TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got work , too . We 've all got work , Tom , that 's why they call it that . " Work . " Because that 's what we do here . p. 21 TOM I agree . And I want to get back to mine CARTER Fine . ( Picks up a ball . ) Dollar a point ? TOM nods , and the two men break into a lazy game of Nerf " pig . " The hoop hangs on the back of TOM 'S door . A female CO-WORKER walks in , carrying a stack of reports  --  ruins the game . She stops at TOM 'S desk and drops a few files . Smiles . CARTER eyes her , then speaks . CARTER Guess what ? JEANNIE What ? CARTER I said guess . JEANNIE Ummm you 're an asshole ? TOM giggles out loud at this one . CARTER blushes , then regroups . The girl smiles over at TOM . TOM Aaah , you cheated ! Somebody gave you the answers JEANNIE Exactly . ( Grins . ) Morning , Tom CARTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to get back . CARTER Okay , then do n't worry about it . JEANNIE Just tell me .

CARTER Am not ! I mean , yes , I am a dick sometimes , but not at the moment . JEANNIE So ? CARTER He does . TOM I do not . ( to her ) Jeannie , he 's just trying to CARTER It 's what I heard TOM Carter , knock it off . JEANNIE stands there for a bit longer , looking back and forth between the men . Finally , she saunters out . TOM You prick . CARTER What ? TOM That 's not funny . CARTER It was pretty damn funny from over here TOM I 'm serious . p. 23 CARTER Me , too . Try sitting on the couch and see if it 's any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . TOM You know we 've been dating sort of . CARTER Of course . I-know-all . TOM I mean it . I said how she gets . CARTER Yes , I know ( Beat . ) Why do you think I said something ? I 'm not gon na tell the snack-shop guy out front I mean , why the fuck would he care ? It only stings if it 's personal TOM You are a piece of work , you know that ? CARTER I try . ( Beat . ) Anyway , that 's what you can expect , by the way . Mean-spirited shit like that until you tell me who she is . TOM I 'm not gon na say a damn thing CARTER Your choice . But I 'll find out , I promise TOM Yeah , yeah CARTER And then up goes her Polaroid in the break room . TOM Fucker . CARTER Maybe . After you 're through with her , of course p. 24 TOM Shut up and go back to your lair , Satan . CARTER Fair enough . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of heavy to you ? TOM What ? CARTER A minute ago does n't she look a bit sloppy or something ? In her ass , I 'm saying . Flabby . TOM No CARTER Come on , I 'm just talking . It 's not a judgment on you . TOM I know , but I 'm not obsessed by bodies the way you are . I 'm not . CARTER I do n't know what it is , but I was noticing yesterday . She came into my office with her suit jacket off and had on one of those , you know , flimsy sort of blouses with the no-sleeves look . I seriously think her arms have gotten chunkier or whatever . The past few months . TOM Dude , you need some help CARTER What ? It 's an observation , that 's all her arms . The ass . I ca n't help it if I observe things . TOM No , but you can keep it to yourself ! And your therapist , who I hope you 're still seeing CARTER Nah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total bitch . p. 25 TOM Nice . CARTER It 's not , like , some derogatory thing I 'm saying about her  --  not the therapist cunt , but Jeannie  --  it 's just an idle thought . She seems to be packing it on some . That 's the problem with winter : chicks do n't get out much and they bloat up TOM Okay , I really ca n't deal with you right now , so go . CARTER Whatever . We on for basketball Friday ? Chad ca n't make it any other time TOM Ahh , yeah . But after nine , okay ? I 've got a dinner thing . ( off of CARTER 's look ) For work , dumbshit . CARTER Sure . TOM It is ! I 've got those folks from the , ahhh you know CARTER No , what ? TOM The Chicago group is coming into town . ( Beat . ) They are CARTER Cool . I 'll e-mail the other guys and meet you at the Y. See ya . CARTER finally gets up and saunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits . TOM returns to his work as CARTER looks back inside the room . p. 26 CARTER I 'm swinging past the restaurant to check , so you better be telling the truth TOM Asshole . CARTER That 's me . But when I get my Ph.D . it 'll be Doctor Asshole , so , hey . Something to look forward to He is gone . TOM shakes his head and gets back to the files that JEANNIE has left . A minute later , he looks up to see her standing in his doorway . JEANNIE Hey . TOM Oh , hi . There . JEANNIE I forgot some here . ( Holds up an extra file . ) Forgot this one . TOM Ah . Thanks . Ummmm TOM gets up and crosses to her , reaching for the folder . She holds it a moment , and they both tug on it . JEANNIE So is it true , what he said ? TOM Who , Carter ? JEANNIE Yeah . TOM Ummm JEANNIE Oh . ( Beat . ) So where does that put us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I 'm not saying it 's he 's an idiot , so , you know , you have to make some allowances . p. 27 JEANNIE Right . TOM But I do n't know what I 'm doing . You know that . I 'm  --  JEANNIE Yes , I do . All while we were going out I could tell that , but I still liked you . Gave you a million or so chances , but hey . Whatever . TOM I know that , Jeannie , I know , I 'm just it 's complicated . JEANNIE I 'm not saying that I 'm some , you know , glamour queen or whatnot , but guys do like me . They do . TOM I know , come on please . I like you . Do n't say it like that . JEANNIE Yeah , well TOM I do . JEANNIE Does n't seem like it . I mean , I 've tried sweet and forceful and , you know , nonchalant everything . I do n't get it . What do you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? ( Beat . ) So , just tell me . Is he lying or not ? TOM Carter is I mean , by nature he 's a liar . You know that . He likes to provoke people . Get ' em riled up . JEANNIE Which says nothing . p. 28 TOM Jeannie , come on JEANNIE So you are . TOM I 'm not no . I 'm not " seeing " any other person , all right ? Promise . JEANNIE Look , I 'm just asking , so do n't make it seem like I 'm pulling on your eyeteeth or something . If you do n't wan na tell me , then okay . TOM I 'm saying it , to you , right now . JEANNIE Yeah , but TOM Carter 's an ass . He 's JEANNIE So why do you hang out with him then ? Huh ? All those guys down in Development . ( Beat . ) Why ? TOM Because I 'm needy and shallow . ( Smiles . ) Hell , I du n no ! Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , it 's easier to go along sometimes , to just hang out and not make , like , some big tsunami or that kind of thing . I know it 's dumb , but he 's funny . He does n't bug me that much . JEANNIE Obviously . TOM Jeannie , come on , do n't be he 's just playing around . JEANNIE So , nobody then ? p. 29 TOM I did n't I 'm not saying What ? JEANNIE Do n't do your circles thing , okay ? Do not do that  --  TOM What 're you even  --  ? JEANNIE Talking around shit , that 's what I 'm saying . I hate that ! Are-you-dating-someone ? TOM No . Kind of . Hell , I du n no ! I 'm I 've met someone . Got a drink one night . It 's not some big thing . JEANNIE I see . TOM Look , we said that we could I 'm not doing anything , like , wrong . JEANNIE But you 're pretty defensive about it . TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . JEANNIE I 'm not anything . Except confused . By a guy who tells me that he 's interested in me . " Very , " in fact , was the word he used . " I am very interested in you . " And we date , and then we stop , and then he sends me stuff , like flowers and letters , and keeps calling and wants to do it again , to try one more time , he tells me but then we do not go out . We see each other at work , but he keeps putting off the next date because of God , I could n't begin to list all of the excuses because it 's Monday afternoon , and I would probably be here , like , through the weekend . But now I hear he 's met someone , a someone who he has managed  --  even with his many work obligations and boys ' nights out and all his other related juvenile shit  --  he has somehow squeezed yet another person onto his social calendar . JEANNIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . p. 30 TOM See ? This is what I was talking about . JEANNIE No , this is what I 'm talking about right now ! The bullshit you do to me and expect me to keep crawling back in here and taking it . TOM I do n't want you to JEANNIE Oh , so now you do n't want me here ? Is that it ? Go ahead , then , say it . Go on . Say-it . TOM No , Jeannie , Jesus , can we just I 'd like to talk about this , but not in the middle of a workday . All right ? I mean , can we maybe JEANNIE You can " maybe " kiss my ass , Tom , and that 's a definite maybe . We can pencil that one in my planner right now , okay ? JEANNIE turns abruptly and walks out . Before TOM can even react , she is back . Standing in the doorway . TOM Jeannie , please . Let 's JEANNIE I ca n't wait to meet her . Really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot to give you this . TOM moves apprehensively toward the door . JEANNIE drops the file onto the floor and stalks off. @x TOM and HELEN sitting at a table in a cozy restaurant . A meal spread out before them . In the middle of a chat . TOM I 'm just curious , that 's all . HELEN What ? It 's not some big TOM No , I know , but I meant to ask you before I mean , about the HELEN Go ahead , then . TOM You ( Beat . ) You love war movies ? HELEN smiles over at him and nods . Says nothing else . TOM Okay , first obvious question . Why ? HELEN Just because . TOM Uh-uh , no , not fair ! That 's not an answer HELEN Yes , it is . TOM But not a good one . One that tells me anything about you HELEN Ohhh , I see . You 're gon na dig deep now , is that it ? TOM Something like that HELEN All right , fine . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty explosions . This makes TOM laugh , and he reaches out for HELEN 's hand . He grabs it and squeezes , holding on to it . She notices . p. 32 TOM Come on ! Seriously HELEN Okay , okay I 'm ( Beat . ) You have my hand there , you know . TOM Yeah , I is that not ? HELEN It 's fine . Just wanted to ask and see if it was an accident or not . TOM Umm no . It was n't , no . But now you 're making me self-conscious . TOM looks around the restaurant . HELEN notices this , too . HELEN You do n't have to keep holding it if you do n't want to . TOM No , I was I 'm ( Grins . ) Busted . HELEN I just did n't want there to be any confusion . TOM I appreciate it . ( indicating ) That was me being stupid . Silly . I want to , hold it , I mean , if that 's okay . HELEN Of course . TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . Silence . HELEN I would like to have a bit more of my chicken later but I can wait . p. 33 TOM Sorry ! Shit HELEN I 'm kidding you . TOM Oh . TOM looks at her , then pulls away , embarrassed . He points at her food . TOM No , you should that 's fine . We can do that after , or walking back to the car or something . We should eat . Yes . HELEN Tom I really was joking . TOM I know , but ( He eats . ) I 'm ready for some of mine , too . HELEN All right . They both take a bite or two , smiling across the table . TOM So , seriously what 's the deal on the war flicks ? You know way too many of those things to 've just been reading the TV Guide or that kind of thing HELEN What ? Five Graves to Cairo , The Dawn Patrol , Von Ryan 's Express , Hell Is for Heroes , The McKenzie Break , The Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max , Pork Chop Hill , The Desert Rats , Cross of Iron , Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison TOM Okay , okay , I get it ! Jesus and most of those are obscure , too . p. 34 HELEN I know . ( Beat . ) I used to work in audiovisual . TOM You 're very except that one . HELEN Which ? TOM Lonely Are the Brave . HELEN It 's a what ? TOM A western . Sort of , one of those modern kind . With Kirk Douglas . HELEN Oh , right , no , I mean is it ? TOM Yeah . You know , with him on the horse , and he 's being chased by , like , guys in helicopters and stuff ? It 's that one . It 's really good , but , yeah . Western . HELEN Huh . ( Considers . ) Oh , right , right , yes , I 've seen it , but I 'm getting the name confused . I mean None but the Brave . The Frank Sinatra one . TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is now , like , an officially quirky side of you . HELEN I grew up with ' em . That 's all . I have three brothers , plus my dad . They were on all the time , and so I watched a lot of them , or parts of ' em , anyway . All growing up . TOM Yeah , me , too . I mean , that same scenario . What is it about fathers and those movies ? ( Beat . ) He also directed that one , too . p. 35 HELEN Your father ? TOM No Sinatra ! You 're funny . HELEN Thanks . TOM I mean , jolly . ( Beat . ) Kidding . They both laugh again . Really enjoying each other now . TOM But , seriously , I wonder . Why ? HELEN Well most of them either fought in wars or wanted to , or had some relative who did or whatever . Or they just like watching other guys get shot , that could be it , too . TOM Probably right ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed being around my family . Sitting on the couch , big bowl of popcorn , with drinks and stuff . Snacks . It 's like some memory thing now . It felt good . I could be watching this bunch of soldiers getting wiped out or a guy blowing up some bridge , like at Toko-Ri , yet it made me feel all cozy inside . And hungry , too which I 've always associated with cozy , anyway . TOM Right HELEN And it saved me the embarrassment of sitting around waiting for boys to call me up . TOM What do you mean ? p. 36 HELEN Ummm , you probably could n't guess , but I did n't date a lot when I was in school . TOM Oh . HELEN ( whispers ) I used to be a touch heavy . HELEN chuckles . TOM joins in halfheartedly , then stops . TOM Huh . ( Beat . ) And is that is it all right to talk about I du n no , your weight and everything , or should I ? HELEN No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Not anymore . Not that I 'm all perfectly adjusted , but you know . Whatever . TOM " Anymore " ? HELEN Well it 's all shame when you 're younger , is n't it ? You hate how you look or sound or , you know , all that stuff that we go through . As kids . But I 'm pretty all right with who I am now . The trick is getting other people to be okay with it ! TOM Right . And , so have you always been , like you know ? HELEN No . What ? TOM Ummm , big boned , or whatever . HELEN laughs out loud at this one . Another beauty , which makes TOM giggle along . She takes his hand this time . p. 37 HELEN That was kind of precious . One of my favorites , actually . TOM What ? HELEN " Big-boned . " My mom used to throw that one around , too . TOM Well I 'm just trying to be HELEN Do n't . Not for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seriously . TOM Okay . HELEN Whether we end up together or just friends or , you know , anything . I want you to be honest with me . TOM I can do that . Promise . HELEN Good . Great . Fair enough . TOM So , then , ummm " heavy . " Have you always been that way ? HELEN You mean fat , right ? TOM No , I 'm not you said HELEN Tom TOM honestly ! I would n't say that you 're Helen , I mean it . ( Beat . ) I like your body , I mean what I imagine your body to be . It 's HELEN Come on . You 're here , okay , so I 'm not worried about it . No matter what I said to you that day at the deli , you would not be seen with me , in public , if you did n't want to be . Right ? p. 38 TOM Sure . Yes . HELEN So , then I 'm good . Secure about it . Truthfully . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little bit , anyway . TOM That 's true . HELEN But if you saw me I 'm saying if you were out with friends or that kind of deal , some guy friends and all hanging around at the bar , a few drinks and playing that one dart game or watching pay-per-view , and you just saw me there , across the room , what would you say ? TOM I 'm I du n no I 'd probably HELEN If one of your pals elbows you and points me out , says to you , " God , look at that one over there . What a fat pig ! " Would you jump up and protect me  --  I 'm in another booth , ca n't hear you , so  --  be honest . Would you defend me and say , " Hey , be nice , she 's just big-boned , " or would you laugh at me , at least go along with what he said and let it go ? Which ? TOM That 's Helen , that is a no-win situation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN Then do n't answer , and we can sit here and finish up our chicken stuff . ( Smiles . ) What 's this called again ? p. 39 TOM Ummm you got the " Piccata , " and I got the , I do n't remember now . Some crap . The " Rustico , " maybe ? HELEN Yeah , that was it . ( Beat . ) So ? TOM sits for a moment , not making eye contact and playing with his food . Finally , he glances up . TOM I would maybe play along . HELEN I know . TOM Not because I but , you know how people are , and I might just not I du n no . HELEN It 's okay , Tom . You do n't have to defend it . Most people are like that . I 'm even like that , about certain things , so TOM Yes , but I want you to know , for you to realize it 's just out of the way that we 're raised . How we 're taught to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . It 's not me , or how I feel about you now , as a person . But , yeah , I could 've done that . Just gone along . ( Beat . ) I do that a lot . HELEN Well , that 's something to work on then , right ? TOM Yep . That 's true . HELEN Then good . HELEN touches his hand again , then goes back to eating . TOM watches her as she takes a few more bites . p. 40 TOM Ca n't believe you 've seen None but the Brave ! HELEN It 's not that bad . It was a good idea for a movie , just not so well done . TOM What do you mean ? HELEN Just that the whole notion that those guys could get along for a while , the Japanese  --  Japs , as they were called at our place  --  and the Americans . It 's the middle of the war and everything , World War II , but for part of the show , they all live together fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? TOM In my house . My dad called ' em Nips . HELEN Nice TOM Yeah , very forward thinker , my old man was . HELEN Obviously . TOM Anyway ( Beat . ) Hold on , though . I thought you said you did n't have time for fiction . You told me that . HELEN I did . TOM But then , how come ? HELEN Everybody loves movies . That 's not the same as fiction TOM Really ? p. 41 HELEN Maybe that 's just me , but a book is one thing Movies are totally different . ( Smiles . ) You already pointed out than I 'm quirky TOM Very true . Okay , I 'll go with that . ( Beat . ) How 's the chicken ? HELEN Delicious . Little bit of lemon and capers , I like it . TOM Nice . HELEN And , so , what about you ? Tell me some more about something HELEN is about to continue when she notices that TOM is staring off , behind her . She swings around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOM awkwardly stands up . TOM Hey CARTER Well , hello there . TOM Carter , this is Helen , I 'd like you to meet my this is Carter , who works with us . I mean , me . HELEN smiles and holds a hand up . CARTER takes it and shakes it . Looks around . CARTER Where 's the rest of ' em ? Late ? An uncomfortable moment hangs in the air . HELEN begins to stand . p. 42 HELEN I 'm going to use the little girls ' room . Even though I hate the term . TOM Right ! ( Tries to laugh . ) Me , too . CARTER Well it 's better than " shitter . " HELEN Very true . ( Beat . ) Nice to meet you , Carter . CARTER Yeah , you , too . She walks off , and CARTER watches her go  --  all the way offstage . He then turns to TOM and gestures . CARTER I hope it 's twins . ( Smiles . ) Bet you 're glad you promised to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell is that ? TOM I just told you . Her name 's Helen , and she 's you know CARTER and how come the others are n't here ? TOM Because we 're I mean CARTER reaches over and pokes at TOM 'S shirt . Giggles . CARTER Jesus nice shirt there , buddy . They 're gon na think we manufacture mirror balls or something . p. 43 TOM Very funny ! I 'm not I hate doing a suit all the time . The whole tie thing CARTER Huh . O-kay . ( Beat . ) They did n't just send her , did they ? Not that she could n't eat for five TOM Carter , do n't say stuff like that . It 's not nice . CARTER I know that . I was n't being nice . That was me being honest . TOM Seriously , though CARTER Hey , she 's not here , okay , so can you ease up on the Knights of the Round Table shit ? She 's off to the bathroom ( Beat . ) With a basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not mistaken TOM Can you please ? Jesus . CARTER Okay , all right . God , you are really just not fun at all when you 're out with a woman , you know that ? Even some beast from work TOM She 's not just leave her alone . CARTER Fine . ( Beat . ) You gon na be there by nine ? Howard 's got ta hit the road by eleven-thirty TOM Yes , you know that yes . ( looking around ) Why are you here ? p. 44 CARTER I told you I was coming by . TOM Yeah , but how 'd you know where ? CARTER Because you always come here ! The same damn restaurant , anytime you take somebody out the first time . To impress them , I suppose but Tom ? This place is kinda out of the loop , I hate to tell you . By , like , ahh , three years . TOM Yeah , well , I like it . ( Beat . ) So , can I just finish up and do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya . TOM Fine . CARTER Thought I might catch you with you know . Her . TOM You really are an ass CARTER Pretty much . But , surprisingly , it does n't give me a big head TOM Will you just please go ? ! Come on . CARTER I will , all right . ( Grins . ) Should 've gone with a buffet for this one coulda gotten her grazing rights . TOM Carter CARTER " Excuse me , ma'am , could you mooove along , please ? " This does n't come out of your expense account , does it , because you know . Wow . We 're only a Fortune 500 company . p. 45 TOM Leave ! ( Laughs . ) Seriously . CARTER Fine , fine . See you at nine . TOM Yeah . See you . CARTER takes another gulp from his drink , then stops . He starts off but leans in close to TOM . CARTER Dude I so wish I would 've caught you with her ! Damn it . Anyway At that moment , HELEN returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and seats her . HELEN Thank you CARTER Pleasure . ( to HELEN ) And do n't let this cheapskate stiff you on the dessert ! They 've got a hell of a pastry chef here HELEN Good to know TOM See you later , Carter . HELEN Good-bye . Nice to meet you . CARTER You , too , ummm what was it again ? HELEN Helen . CARTER Right . ( over his shoulder ) And say hello to the Windy City for me ! CARTER is gone . TOM watches him go and then turns back to HELEN . Tries to smile . p. 46 HELEN What does that mean ? TOM He 's you know , he 's a HELEN Why would he think I 'm from there ? Chicago ? TOM He does n't . No . That was for me . To me . I 'm going there for work . HELEN Really ? TOM For , like , yeah . Just a day or two next week . Business . HELEN Oh . I see . That 's , you did n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we just got to talking , is all . HELEN Right . ( Beat . ) Did he seem to like me at all ? I know we only had  --  TOM Carter ? No , yeah , he totally liked you . A lot , I think . HELEN He seems okay . Nice . ( Beat . ) And he works with you ? TOM Uh-huh . Down the hall . I mean , not with me , but I see him around . HELEN Got it . They both return to eating their meals . Silence . A long one , in fact . Finally , TOM stops and looks at HELEN . TOM I know that you know . I mean , I can tell . That you do . I made a he thinks that this is , like , a business dinner , and I did n't say anything . So , I want you to know that I 'm sorry . I am . He really just surprised me and I got all I did wan na say something , but I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to be but I 'm not . p. 47 HELEN It 's okay . It 's something to work on then , right ? TOM Yep . That 's true . HELEN Then good . ( Beat . ) You wan na take a look at the dessert menu ? Supposed to have a great pastry chef here . TOM Okay . In a minute They both take another bite or two of their food . After a moment , HELEN reaches over and takes TOM 'S hand . He leans over and gives her a kiss on the shoulder . Rests his head for a second. @x TOM at his desk , working . CARTER sprawled on a couch and reading a magazine . He holds up a photo for TOM to look at . They both smile . After a moment , JEANNIE appears in the doorway . Silent but staring over at TOM . JEANNIE There 's no report . TOM Sorry ? CARTER Hi , Jeannie . What 's up ? JEANNIE Hey . ( to CARTER ) Gee , you 're in here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , it 's my gift . JEANNIE No kidding . CARTER And I 'm still crawling up the ol ' ladder faster than you that must be really annoying . JEANNIE You 'll never know how much . CARTER Oh , I 've got a pretty good sense of it ( Stretches . ) I 'm working off-site today . JEANNIE is done with CARTER and turns to TOM . Stares . TOM What ? Good morning , by the way p. 49 JEANNIE Good morning , Tom . How 's things ? TOM You know . Okay . JEANNIE I 'll bet . I will just bet . ( Beat . ) Carter , can you give us a minute , please ? CARTER Not if this is gon na get good ( to TOM ) Do you want me to go ? JEANNIE Please TOM I do n't I 'm not afraid of us talking in front of him . He 'll find out , anyway . CARTER Exactly ! I promise not to say a word . JEANNIE Yeah , just print a story in the newsletter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CARTER laughs , but no one joins in . He sputters out and sits back . JEANNIE Fine . Whatever . TOM Seriously Jeannie , if you wan na say something to me , go ahead . ( He stands up . ) That 's fine . JEANNIE Then why 're you standing ? TOM What ? Oh , you know , just I felt like stretching . CARTER laughs . JEANNIE glances over at him  --  he smiles and mimes zipping his mouth shut . She turns back to TOM . p. 50 JEANNIE You know I 'm in accounting , right ? You do know that . TOM Of course . JEANNIE So anything you turn in is going to come past me , I mean , over my desk . True ? TOM I guess JEANNIE No , you know it . I know that you know because I 've had you come in there , to my office , looking for stuff before . An old receipt or some stack of files . I mean , it 's how we first TOM No , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , so I 'm sure you realize the way these things go . The course they take . You turn in your expense reports , attach the receipts , and write in the little explanations , and we do the rest . You know all this . TOM Yeah , Jeannie , I get it . I mean , I know how to do that . So ? JEANNIE I waited for the Chicago dinner to come through , just so I could see . I heard Carter joking around about it , and so I wanted to , you know , check out who you were with . ( Beat . ) But nothing has been turned in yet . Why 's that ? Because you 've always been  --  how can I put this ?  --  pretty damn anal about it before . TOM , glancing over at CARTER , does n't say anything . p. 51 CARTER One quick interjection ? This is not my fault here . I wan na be very clear about that . Tom ? It was just an offhanded comment , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARTER I 'm done . JEANNIE Good . ( Turns . ) Tom ? What 's up ? TOM Nothing . Jesus , I mean JEANNIE I 'm just curious . But it 's also my business , so , you know TOM What , to , like , stalk me ? JEANNIE Please , you wish To keep up on how people are utilizing their expense accounts , shit like that . TOM So , what ? You 're busting me for not asking to be reimbursed ? JEANNIE No I 'm keeping things straight . All right ? It 's my job . TOM Yeah , but I bet you 're not you know , down at everybody 's office , going through all their JEANNIE Yeah , I do , as a matter of fact . I stay here late almost every night , digging through mountains of crap that you guys spend out there on the road and in restaurants and at your little luxury hotels , so it 's not just you . All right ? Please do not flatter yourself p. 52 TOM Whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm asking . " Hey , whatever happened to that Chicago dinner that Tom supposedly went on ? " JEANNIE finishes and waits . CARTER sits up , interested . TOM I I guess I must 've forgot . JEANNIE To what ? TOM To turn in the report . My receipts and stuff . I 'll I can staple it to next month 's , right ? JEANNIE You could . Or I can take it from you now , if you want . TOM No , I 'm I 've got it all back at my apartment , so later 's fine . JEANNIE It was a business dinner , right ? With the guys from Chicago . TOM Yes . CARTER It 's what he told me . ( Holds up a hand . ) Sorry TOM I mean , not with the " guys , " per se , but this woman . One woman who came in from yeah . A woman . CARTER Helen , I think . ( Looks at TOM . ) What ? I 'm just being helpful p. 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in town , and we sat down and had a meal and talked over the , I mean , some of the accounts from there . Like Amtel and others . JEANNIE I see . Fine . TOM All right ? Can we put the hot tongs away now , or was there some more stuff that you wanted to ? TOM tries to laugh , and CARTER joins in . JEANNIE stares . JEANNIE Carter , can you please leave us alone for a second ? Please . CARTER But this is fun . Tom ? TOM No , Jeannie , shit this is my office and he can what is up with you ? ! JEANNIE God , fine . Whatever you want . you scared or something ? TOM Ummmm maybe . Yeah . I would n't exactly want you handling a Ginsu knife right now or anything . CARTER laughs again , which makes TOM giggle a bit . JEANNIE Chicago does n't have a record of anybody coming here last month . No one . No employee  --  man , woman . Fat chick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago ? JEANNIE I did , yes . TOM Jeannie , I mean , shit that is that 's , like , so JEANNIE within my job description . TOM No , that goes beyond your I mean , let 's be honest here , you are being a little nuts about this ! JEANNIE If I am , you made me that way . TOM I did n't do ( to CARTER ) Dude , back me up here . CARTER starts to speak , but JEANNIE cuts him off . JEANNIE And so I found it odd  --  especially when I had to maneuver around the girth issue , trying to describe her from what Carter had said  --  and I 'm just drawing blanks from this woman over the phone who 's probably thinking I 'm some crazy person , but I have all the right information and the clearances , and so she 's accessing a bunch of these personnel records but , uh-uh , nothing . Not a single flight booked here in over two months . So I slapped one of those little Post-it flags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing . Maybe you can help me out . TOM looks over at CARTER , who holds up a finger . p. 55 CARTER I never said " fat . " JEANNIE Carter , you told me she was huge . CARTER Yeah which is totally different . Shaq is huge , but nobody says the guy 's fat JEANNIE You said she was a pig ! CARTER I do n't think we should get off on a tangent here ( to TOM ) I mean , Tom , you 're the one who said she was in from Chicago . TOM No CARTER You did n't ? TOM No , I was you inferred that CARTER Yeah , because you told me you were having dinner with the so , was she or not ? JEANNIE That 's really the question , is n't it ? ( Beat . ) Tom . TOM She was yes , I was having dinner with one of our , she 's a colleague from Chicago , but from one of our subsidiary suppliers I should 've been clear about the her CARTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Helen . About Helen 's trip to to see us . About the stuff . p. 56 JEANNIE Tom , listen to yourself . Stop . You are , like , the worst liar ever . I mean it . In history . TOM Fine . Whatever you say . TOM sits again , frustrated . JEANNIE approaches TOM . TOM What ? JEANNIE Ummm just the obvious stuff . Who-was-it ? TOM She 's a just this girl . JEANNIE A " girl . " TOM Woman , then ! I du n no . You know I mean " woman . " A woman I met . She 's someone that I 've who I took out once , just got talking to at lunch one time and I was yeah . JEANNIE is lost for words . CARTER is connecting the dots . JEANNIE I see . And , so , she 's ? CARTER Oh shit . Fuck ! Are you fucking kidding me ? ! HOLY SHIT ! ! CARTER realizes he is being loud and gets up , crosses to the door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEANNIE ) I do n't mean to be indelicate , so you 're gon na have to forgive me here , but ( back to TOM ) This is not her . You got ta tell me , tell me that much . This is not the her her . Is it ? p. 57 TOM Yeah . ( Beat . ) Yes , Carter . CARTER Oh-my-God . Oh-my  --  TOM Just stop , okay ? CARTER I mean OH-MY-GOD ! This is a Jesus Christ ! ! She 's  --  TOM Would you just get out of here ? ! I mean it . Both of you JEANNIE Fine , Tom , I 'll go . CARTER Yeah , I got ta go find my camera " Tommy Joins the Circus ! " TOM Asshole . CARTER Oh , come on , man ! You 'd be doing the same thing to me TOM Bullshit CARTER That 's a lie , and you know it ! You totally would TOM No , I would n't . Nope . ( Beat . ) We mess around a lot , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you are seeing her , then . TOM It 's not , no , but why do I have to discuss this ? ! We 're on the clock here . Come on JEANNIE Sure , fine , but if you wan na stop and talk about the Celtics for two hours with the guys , that 'd be okay , right ? Yeah , that 's cool But if I come in here because I 'm trying to figure out just what the hell is going on in my relationship , well , that 's something we better talk about later . Let 's save that for some later time . Yeah , that 's pretty fair ! p. 58 TOM We do n't have a relationship ! ! JEANNIE Oh , really ? ! TOM No , we do n't I 'm sorry , but you keep saying that , and I 'm you know I keep trying to tell you that I 'm not , this is n't JEANNIE You said you wanted to try again ! YOU told me that ! ! TOM To keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from calling and going on and on and on about this all the time ! ! That 's why ! ! ! JEANNIE Oh . TOM Okay ? I mean , God JEANNIE I see . TOM I 'm sorry , but I just do n't JEANNIE Then fine . Good . JEANNIE suddenly reaches across the desk and smacks TOM across the face . Hard , with an open palm . He stumbles back and hits his chair , which rolls out from under him . JEANNIE walks to the door , swings it open wide . Before she goes , however , she turns back to CARTER and pushes him hard against the couch . JEANNIE exits , slamming the door behind her . TOM crosses to the door , opens it . Looks out . Holds up a hand to someone down the hall . Closes the door again . p. 59 CARTER I think she took that pretty well . TOM You dick . CARTER Hey , do n't blame this shit on me . TOM I 'm not , I just damn it ! Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with people and ? CARTER Because we 're human . It 's what makes us different than the rest of the animals . ( Beat . ) Did n't you watch Doctor Dolittle ? TOM Yeah , thanks , that really helps . CARTER I do what I can TOM sits back down in his chair , and CARTER plops back on the couch . They sit in silence for a moment . CARTER Hey TOM What ? CARTER This is n't meant as a you know , to make up for what I said or whatnot , but my mom was fat . Is . TOM That 's great . CARTER No , I 'm just saying I know what it 's like , I mean , why you were so embarrassed or TOM I was n't , I just hell . I du n no . I sorta froze and , and then p. 60 CARTER Dude , I understand . Like , totally . ( Beat . ) I used to walk ahead of her in the mall or , you know , not tell her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My own mom . I mean I 'm fifteen and worried about every little thing , and I 've got this fucking sumo wrestler in a housecoat trailing around behind me . That 's about as bad as it can get ! I 'm not kidding you . And the thing was , I blamed her for it . I mean , it was n't a disease or like some people have , thyroid or that type of deal she just shoveled shit into her mouth all the time , had a few kids , and , bang , she 's up there at 350 , maybe more . It used to seriously piss me off . My dad was always working late golfing on weekends , and I knew it was because of her . It had to be ! How 's he gon na love something that looks like that , get all sexy with her ? I 'm just a kid at the time , but I can remember thinking that . TOM God , that 's CARTER Yeah , it 's whatever , but this once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albertsons and pushing four baskets around  --  you wan na know how humiliating that shit is ?  --  and I 'm supposed to be at a game by seven , I 'm on JV , and she 's just farting around in the candy aisle , picking up bags of " fun-size " Snickers and checking out the calories . Yeah . I mean , can you believe that ? ! So , I suddenly go off on her , like , this sophomore in high school , but I 'm all screaming in her face " Do n't look at the package , take a look in the fucking mirror , you cow ! ! PUT ' EM DOWN ! " Holy shit , there 's stock boys  --  bunch of guys I know , even  --  are running down the aisle . Manager stumbling out of his glass booth there , the works . ( Beat . ) But you know what ? She does n't say a word about it . Ever . Not about the swearing , the things I called her , nothing . Just this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at a stoplight on the way home . That 's all . p. 61 TOM Wow . I 'm , I mean CARTER I did feel that way , though . Maybe I shouldn't 've yelled or but it was true , what I said . You do n't like being fat , there 's a pretty easy remedy , most times . Do-not-jam-so- **32;3590;TOOLONG . ( Beat . ) It 's not that hard . TOM Right . I guess that 's true . ( Beat . ) It 's confusing , though , the CARTER What ? TOM I du n no , I 'm , like I mean , that night , when you saw us ? Why did n't I just come clean , say that I was having dinner , out with a friend even , instead of making all that shit up ? CARTER Because you 're a pussy . TOM Man , come on CARTER No , I say that in the best way . We all are  --  guys , I mean  --  if it comes right down to it . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes in TOM I know ! I wan na be better at that sorta stuff , but a lot of the time I 'm just yeah . A big wuss . CARTER Aah , do n't worry about it ca n't all be Thomas More . And anyway , look what happened to him ! Poor bastard p. 62 TOM True . ( Beat . ) No offense , but how the hell do you know about Thomas More ? CARTER Hey I only cheated off the top two percentile in my class . TOM nods and drifts . CARTER does the same . Silence . TOM Geez , I wish Jeannie was n't so , you know . Damn . CARTER She 's pissed . I mean , nobody likes getting screwed around TOM I did n't ( Beat . ) You think this is how I wanted it to end up ? Huh ? CARTER No but it 's the way these things usually do . TOM I guess . CARTER I know . The guy who first thought up the whole " I hope we can still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere TOM Probably . ( Beat . ) You think maybe I should go down there and talk to her ? Just CARTER Oh , yeah , that 's a good idea . Meet her on her turf with all those accounting chicks around . Perfect . TOM I do n't want her all mad , though . Maybe just an e-mail p. 63 CARTER Yeah , with one of those smiley-face icons or something . Come on , be serious ! TOM What ? CARTER It 's over . You are so done TOM I know . I 'm not saying to try and salvage anything but just so that we can shit , I du n no ! We have to work together , so CARTER It 's the way of the world . Breakups are ugly . I mean , unless you get to watch ' em from over here . ( Laughs . ) She so nailed you ! TOM Come on , Carter , do n't . CARTER I 'm sorry , but it was awesome . I mean , I 've seen you get tagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and this little girl walks in and takes you out like Sonny Liston BAM ! ! Pretty cool . TOM Yeah , hilarious . ( Beat . ) Maybe I 'll just send her a quick one CARTER waves him off and picks up another magazine . TOM quickly types something on his computer and hits a button to send it off . TOM It ca n't hurt . CARTER Not as much as your cheek , anyway . They sit and stare at each other for a moment . Silence . p. 64 CARTER You got a photo ? Of her . TOM You are not getting a picture . Not even a peek CARTER I will not take it . I promise . TOM Uh-huh . Sure . CARTER I wo n't ! I just wan na see her one more time . TOM Man , you are so I do n't even get why I like you . CARTER Because you 're like me . TOM No , I 'm not . CARTER You so are ! Absolutely . TOM That 's not true . ( Grins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You do that little-boy thing , the " I 'm so innocent " trick that women eat up , but you are so much like me it 's not even funny . Seriously TOM Carter , that 's not at all CARTER Bullshit ! You laugh at the same jokes and check out the same asses that I do , you date all these gals and act like you 're Mr. Sensitive , but how does it always end up ? The exact same way it does for me you get bored or cornered or feel a touch nervous , and you drop ' em like they were old produce . Every time . Dude , I 'm not blind p. 65 TOM Yeah , but that 's because I mean , with Jeannie it 's been you know . CARTER I 'm not talking about her . I mean with anybody . Since I 've known you . You are a guy , and guys do whatever they can to get what they want and then get the fuck out . There 's no shame in it it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put down here to be nice . Not exclusively , anyway . Every so often we sprinkle a little " nice " on top , just to keep ' em guessing , but that 's about it . ( Beat . ) If women had any idea how severe we really are they would run screaming into the hills and never return . I firmly believe that . TOM You scare me a little I mean it . CARTER Ahh , it 's just Tuesday . Tuesdays suck They stretch out and contemplate this for a bit . CARTER yawns and turns back to his friend . CARTER Seriously can I see her ? TOM No . CARTER Tom , that 's not very I said some stuff , and I 'm sorry . I did n't know you two were dating . TOM We 're not . I just took her out to dinner , and she 's nice . Okay ? p. 66 CARTER It 's fine . ( Beat . ) So , lemme see . TOM Jesus ( Pulls a snapshot out of his wallet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Goes over to look at it . ) Oh , cool . It 's one of those " glamour shots , " is n't it ? TOM I guess . Yes . CARTER Very nice . I like the boa . TOM Do n't be a prick , or I 'm gon na  --  CARTER Kidding ! Shit , touchy . And is that her natural hair color ? TOM Uh-huh . I think so . CARTER She 's sweet . I mean , from meeting her and everything , I could tell . TOM Thanks . CARTER Does she I mean , does her weight go up and down or ? I only ask because she 's got a nice face , so I 'm curious . TOM She 's not all worried about that kind of thing . Which is sort of refreshing , actually CARTER Sure . TOM Because , you know yeah , I think she 's pretty as well , but we do n't ever talk about that . " What if ? " kinds of shit . She 's happy with who she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . ( Looks again . ) Can you please let me I 'm not six years old . I promise not to take it . TOM ' Kay . TOM very warily lets go of the photo . In stages . Finally , it is in CARTER 'S hands . He studies it . CARTER No , I can tell that she 's a very genuine person , even from a photo . I like the sunburst effect in the background . ( Smiles . ) That 's a joke . TOM Here , just give it back . CARTER Wait I 'm serious , though , if she lost , like , eighty pounds , she 'd be kinda stunning . Could probably get on one of those reality shows . TOM I know , but I just said here . CARTER I mean , I 'm only talking . I 'm not an expert . Perhaps we should see what everybody in the cafeteria thinks TOM Carter ! CARTER , YOU FUCKER ! ! But TOM is trapped behind his desk , and CARTER is off like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOM starts to follow but gives up after a second . Returns to his desk . TOM Bastard . Ahh , screw it . I do n't care . I 'm not gon na be whatever . p. 68 A little bell goes off . Ding ! TOM looks at his computer and sees an e-mail has arrived . He clicks it and reads . TOM " FUK U AND UR FAT BITCH . ASSHOLE . LOL . " ( Beat . ) That 's charming TOM starts to type a response , but it slowly dissolves as he begins to pound harder and harder on the keys . Finally , he stops , exhausted . Pushes the keyboard away . Sits. @x A bedroom . TOM and HELEN lying on top of the covers , in the middle of some fellatio . Both in their underwear . TOM mmmmmmmmm . Oh my shit . Oh , oh , God oh ! ( Climaxes . ) Holy hell . HELEN stays there a moment , then covers him with a sheet . She kisses her way up to his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a biography . Unless it was that one woman . Erica Jong or somebody . HELEN Exactly . ( Kisses him . ) You like ? TOM I more than like that was , ummm , pretty much beyond reason . God . They begin to kiss again , more deeply . Passionately . TOM And what , fair lady , can I do for you in return ? ( A kiss . ) Hmm ? HELEN Ummmmm tell me something . TOM I do n't wan na tell you anything . I wan na well , lots of things . Kiss you . And more kisses , or p. 70 HELEN Okay , but ( kissing ) Seriously . TOM I love your mouth . HELEN Thank you . Thanks . ( trying to ease into a talk ) I need to know TOM I really do like the way you kiss . So much . HELEN You , too . I mean , I like it . Love it I do . We fit , you know ? Our mouths together . It 's important . TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gently putting a hand up to TOM so that he 'll stop . He slowly does . HELEN I wan na ask you this . Please . TOM Sure . Sorry what ? HELEN Are you comfortable with me ? Like , completely comfortable being around me and everything ? TOM I 'm yes . I am . I have honestly never felt more relaxed around a person . I mean HELEN Sure ? ( Beat . ) It 's okay if you 're not because , you know I 'm trying to seem so cool , but I 'm dying inside . You make me feel all everything . p. 71 TOM Helen absolutely I am . Yeah . Did I do something , or ? HELEN No , not " something " like in some big episode or whatever , but , yes , I get this feeling TOM What ? What feeling ? I 'm HELEN Just this sense of things . A vibe or whatnot . From you . TOM That 's weird , because I feel really good about us . I do . HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really . I have n't felt this way for a long time . Years , probably . HELEN I 'm glad . TOM I mean it . ( Beat . ) I staggered into some pretty shitty relationships in the last few years , I mean , a couple real stinkers . ( Beat . ) I 'm , I do n't like talking about them much , if that 's okay , but HELEN I 'm not asking that . TOM I know , I see that , I just wanted you to know . Not that I 'm a super-private guy or anything , I 'm not , I just think it 's sort of bad taste , maybe . To do that . I hate tabloids and reality TV and all that , too . So HELEN That 's okay . There should be one of those presidential medals for that or something p. 72 TOM I agree ! Much more important than that stupid fitness thing . Jumping jacks and crap They laugh together , then kiss for a moment . Happy . HELEN I understand TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Digging into everybody else 's business . Like a bunch of Romans or something got nothing better to do than watch folks pull the guts out of each other ! It 's kind of disgusting HELEN Right . Like in Spartacus TOM Exactly ! So it 's not me being coy or that type of thing I really do feel like that . ( Beat . ) I want you to know , though , how great it has been being with you HELEN Thank you . Thanks . Me , too . ( One kiss for him . ) And I was n't trying to get that out of you TOM Right , I know . I just want to be as up-front as possible I had a bad streak . With women . A certain kind of woman HELEN Okay . ( Beat . ) Me , too . I mean , with relationships . Not women TOM Oh damn ! I was gon na ask if you had any video , but HELEN punches him playfully on the shoulder , and suddenly they are wrestling . Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 73 HELEN Tom . TOM I 'm sorry , I know you were trying to ask me something . What ? HELEN I do feel something . A kind of I du n no . This wall . Of some kind . TOM What ? Honestly , there 's not HELEN Well , okay , not a wall , then , but a sort of TOM Have n't I been with you every day ? I mean , practically , since we met . HELEN Yes TOM We 're always together , here or at my place . Dinner or a movie . Lots of stuff ( Beat . ) My friends have even said things . Noticed it . I 'm hardly with them anymore . HELEN But that 's what I mean . TOM What ? HELEN Neither am I. TOM Oh . I 'm HELEN You know ? I mean , we 've been going out for , like however long , and I only met that one guy . Carter . At the restaurant . TOM That 's true , but I mean , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time or something . One of those office parties or p. 74 HELEN Tom . TOM No , truthfully . I thought maybe on the Fourth or we do a big party at the beach . A cookout and stuff . HELEN Great should I go with the thong or be a little more conventional ? TOM Very funny . I was being serious HELEN Okay . If it 's then fine . A sort of silence drops over them . Both of them staring off . Quiet . TOM I really have n't Helen , I 'm not like that . HELEN I believe you ( Beat . ) But those places that you mentioned ? When we were earlier . They 're isolated . TOM Yeah ? I 'm not following you HELEN It 's like we 're , I du n no , hiding or something . From people . TOM No HELEN You do n't think ? TOM No , Helen , I really do n't . At all . HELEN Huh . Think about it , though . Our apartments , at the theater  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner after . Late . When most places are kind of quiet . Empty . p. 75 TOM What 're you saying ? I do n't HELEN That maybe you 're slowly becoming uncomfortable with this . Or ca n't commit to it or something TOM But I just told you that I 'm HELEN I know , Tom , I know that . I heard you , but if you look at it , kind of examine the thing I du n no . TOM gets off the bed now , standing up and crossing to a bottle of water across the room . Drinks . TOM Well , I do , all right ? I know . And I do n't really like being told that I 'm being all HELEN I 'm not saying that you 're TOM No , yes , you are , Helen . The idea here is that I 'm ashamed of you or something . Right ? HELEN Are you ? TOM No ! Why would I be ? HELEN Well I mean TOM Do n't say it , okay ? Not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have talked about this HELEN Yeah , well , talk is one thing , but actions are sort of pointing me in another direction ( Beat . ) Ca n't help it . p. 76 TOM All I can say is no . So HELEN That 's not true . There 's lots of other things you could say TOM Of course there are , I know that ! It 's a figure of speech ! ! Shit girls always pounce on that , what you do n't say . HELEN I 'm not pouncing I 'm physically unable to pounce . TOM See , that 's your you always do that ! The fat jokes ! STOP IT ! I do n't like it HELEN Hey , you 're not the one who 's been mistaken for pregnant six times in their life , okay , so just ( Beat . ) It 's a defense mechanism , Tom . TOM I know , but HELEN Do it before it 's done to you . TOM I would n't do n't imply that ! I would never do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe not the jokes , but like we said before . You might in other ways . Subtler ways . TOM Helen HELEN And that 's what I 'm asking here . Is that what you 're doing ? With the way we go about things so , like , secretively . ( Beat . ) Is it ? TOM stops and considers for a moment , unsure what to say . p. 77 TOM What am I supposed to say now ? To that ? HELEN Just the truth . TOM I 'm I meant something easier . HELEN smiles at this and stands up , goes to him . Takes a drink from the bottle . A candy from a dish . Kisses him . HELEN Sorry . I was going for the big one there . TOM The Big Red One . Pop quiz : name at least three stars from it . Go . HELEN Easy . Lee Marvin , Mark Hamill , and , ummm , oh that one guy . Michael Moore . TOM Nooo that 's a different guy . The documentary guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goof ! HELEN I know , I know , I 'm joking ! It 's the kid from Coming Home . One of those Carradine brothers . What 's his ahh , Robert , I think . TOM Shit , you are good . HELEN It 's true . I did n't mean that " big one . " ( Touches him . ) I meant this . TOM You want that again ? HELEN I do . But only if it wants me TOM It does . Promise . ( Beat . ) But first you got ta catch me p. 78 TOM smiles and slips past her , moving around the room like a prizefighter . He jumps up on the bed and does a little makeshift dancing . HELEN laughs and closes in . HELEN So that 's the deal , huh ? Pursuit . TOM I mean , if you really want me , I figure you ought a work for it HELEN I do n't mind a little work TOM Yeah ? Let 's see what ya got , lady . Suddenly , HELEN makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her way . Off the bed . She picks herself up and circles around , trying to corner him . TOM jumps onto the mattress and executes a silly move in the air . HELEN laughs and chases him over the bed . TOM dodges her and tries to escape . He almost makes it to the door , but she brings him down to the ground . He tries to crawl away , but it is no use . He is trapped . They start laughing . TOM Okay , okay I give ! Damn , you got me . HELEN Good that 's the way I 'd like to keep it . And you 've got me , if you want me . TOM Absolutely . Yes . ( Kisses her . ) Yes . HELEN Yeah , but all of me . That 's what I need here , Tom . All . p. 79 TOM I know . HELEN I 'm not looking for fairy tale or out of the ballpark or anything just a person who cares about me like I do them . Simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit , how do I come back from that ? HELEN That 's what I 'm saying . I do not need a comeback . No jokes , nothing clever . Just be very clear and honest . TOM starts to say something but kisses HELEN instead . He leads her onto a couch that is positioned in front of the bed . Sits her down and joins her . TOM Listen HELEN That 's the worst kind of lead-in in the world . Just so you know . TOM It is ? HELEN Oh , yeah . Sounds like some parole hearing TOM Ahh . Well , I wo n't use it , then . I was n't going for that . So HELEN Just pointing it out . TOM Look HELEN Equally bad . TOM Shit ! HELEN Sorry . p. 80 TOM Come on ! HELEN I 'm just trying to TOM This is pissing me off now . HELEN I 'm sorry , I was just sort of kidding that time . Forgive me . TOM Yeah , well I 'm working on being truthful here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All right ? HELEN Please . Bumble on . She tosses in a smile , and it works . Slowly , TOM returns it to her . He touches her face . Strokes her hair . TOM Helen HELEN Better . TOM STOP ! She buries her head in his shoulder , laughing . He grabs her and tries to make an " angry " face but breaks down . Laughs . He tries to get serious again . HELEN My fault . TOM I know . Now stop ( Beat . ) Helen , I am very attracted to you . Both mentally and physically . I would hope you can see that by now , but I will continue to work on it so that we 're on the same page here . I 'm sorry if  --  ( Holds up a finger to silence her . ) Wait . My turn now . Forgive me if it has seemed that I 'm running a CIA operation here or whatnot , that was not the intention , and I will also tinker with that part of the relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , but some very good , positive stuff going on here , from what I can see , anyway . ( Beat . ) You are very important to me very and I hope that you 'll give me the chance to prove that to you in the near future . At the aforementioned volleyball-slash-beach party or at some other to-be-determined public gathering . ( Beat . ) Okay , I 'm now done with the sorriest apology for some perceived slight in the history of all man . Kind . p. 81 HELEN Yeah but it was kind of lovely . TOM Then , good . HELEN I mean it . TOM Thanks . HELEN No , thank you Tom Sullivan . TOM You 're welcome Helen what 's your last name again ? HELEN smacks him playfully on the shoulder again . Twice . TOM Bond . ( Giggles . ) Like in HELEN Do n't spoil it now . TOM Okay . But I bet you can name all of ' em , ca n't you ? In order . HELEN Every last one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait . HELEN reaches up and snaps off a nearby lamp . They are bathed in darkness . HELEN I could n't take it anymore ! Felt like I was under a microscope ( Indicates . ) Underwear is hard to do with any dignity . TOM Do n't worry about it . ( Kisses her . ) You 're awesome . HELEN You , too , Tom . You 're a good man . p. 82 TOM Mmmmmm . I love it when you talk dirty . TOM begins to kiss her . More and more . HELEN responds and , after a moment , lets him unfasten her bra . TOM starts to caress and kiss her there . HELEN 'S eyes slowly close. @x TOM at his desk again . Working . JEANNIE standing nearby with a file in her hand . Waiting . JEANNIE So are you bringing her to the thing next month ? TOM Huh ? ( Looks up . ) Oh , yeah . I think . JEANNIE Not sure ? TOM Ummm , you know she 's got ta check if she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what 's she do ? TOM She 's a printed-word technician . JEANNIE Ahh . A librarian . ( to herself ) Perfect . TOM What 's that ? JEANNIE Nothing . ( Points . ) Are you almost done there ? I need to get those out by five TOM Yeah , hold on . TOM goes back to work while JEANNIE glances around . Takes in the space . JEANNIE No pictures of her up yet . TOM Nah. p. 84 JEANNIE How come ? Tom , frustrated , drops his pen and looks straight at her . TOM Was n't the one that appeared on everybody 's desktop this morning enough ? ( Turns his monitor around . ) You need more laughs than this ? JEANNIE I would n't mind . TOM Great . JEANNIE Yeah , I 'd be up for that . TOM Jesus you really are awful , you know that ? I mean it . JEANNIE Thank you TOM I could n't really tell when we were dating , but God . You 're , like , unreal . JEANNIE Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . TOM I 'm not whatever . JEANNIE That 's exactly right . What-ever . TOM Jeannie ca n't we just be ? JEANNIE Do n't bother . Sign . TOM is about to follow instructions but pulls the files from the desk and slips them in a drawer . Shuts it . Sits back as he checks his watch . p. 85 TOM No , uh-uh , you 've got time . And I want you to tell me Go on . What the hell I did to you that was so bad . Do it . JEANNIE Tom , do n't be a prick , all right ? I need to make FedEx . TOM You will , just  --  JEANNIE No ! I 'm not obligated to talk with you about shit We 're co-workers , we work together now , and that is all . Give me the files . TOM Nope . JEANNIE You 're an asshole TOM Maybe so . I du n no maybe I am . Or have been to you . That 's what I 'm saying ! If I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standoff for a moment , then JEANNIE makes a move toward TOM . He stands up and holds his ground . She backs off and retreats to one side , hands on her hips . JEANNIE I do n't even wan na discuss your fat bitch , okay ? She 's  --  TOM Stop that . JEANNIE So , forget it . I 'll just say about us , I mean , what we 've TOM No , let 's do the whole JEANNIE Fuck you ! Do n't tell me what we 'll do . At all . p. 86 TOM I 'm not . I 'm just saying we should probably , you know JEANNIE We should 've probably done a lot of things ! We should probably be engaged now , if you were n't such a spineless shit , like every other guy . So TOM Your mouth is , like , I du n no . Wow . JEANNIE Yeah , exactly right . " Wow . " I 'm twenty-eight years old , and I just keep hitting the booby prize , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you down TOM But , I 'm not that 's not my JEANNIE Problem ? I did n't say that . It 's no one 's problem , me included it just sucks . That 's what I 'm saying . ( Beat . ) I thought maybe you were different , but you ended up being the same kind of lame guy that I perpetually date , and it just freaks me out a little . That maybe you 're the only type out there . These baby boys who run around in nice clothes , but all they really wan na do is breast-feed for the rest of their days TOM I do n't I ca n't speak for other people , Jeannie , but I  --  JEANNIE I do n't care anymore . I do n't . TOM I 'm just saying that you and I did n't end up working out , but it does n't mean I like you . I did always like you , but we 're p. 87 JEANNIE Tom , I know you think that means something to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same . TOM Fine . I 'm sorry . JEANNIE And that does n't do shit , either . TOM nods , then sits and pulls out the files . Signs his name in several more places and then holds them out . JEANNIE goes over and grabs them . Hovers . TOM Yes ? JEANNIE I know I said I was n't gon na but I really need to know . TOM What ? JEANNIE Her . ( Points at computer screen . ) What 's the story with that one ? TOM Jeannie JEANNIE I mean , I hope it 's some mothering thing or whatever , because if not , it 's just so off-the-charts gross that I do n't know what to say . TOM We should probably stop now . JEANNIE I mean , you know what everybody is saying around here , right ? I know that you know . And it does n't even faze you , huh ? At all ? TOM I 'm I do n't wan na do this . Here . JEANNIE It 's not like she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know it . I can tell you 're aware by the way you 're acting , which is really the puzzling part p. 88 TOM I-like-her . End of story . JEANNIE Yeah , but what the hell ? Did you do something bad in some other life that you 're making up for ? Tell me , because she 's well , you know what she 's like better than the rest of us I mean is she a good cook , or ? TOM STOP IT ! Jeannie , just stop this . I get that you 're pissed at me and you needed to blow off some steam , so that 's why I , I I allowed you to say stuff , but JEANNIE You did n't " allow " me shit , Tom ! I can say whatever I want , anytime I want . The whole company is , why should I be any different ? TOM Then talk if you want to ! I-DO-NOT-CARE ! ! ! I enjoy her because she 's not you , anything like you she 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ! OKAY ? ! Fuck , just leave us alone JEANNIE Ohhhh " us . " So it 's " us " now , huh ? TOM Yeah . It is . JEANNIE And , forgive me for saying it , but she seems a little obsessed with some things like maybe Cheetos . TOM starts to come around his desk now , determined to put an end to this . JEANNIE stares him down . p. 89 TOM I 'm serious here you need to go . JEANNIE I am going , I am , but not because you say so . Because I want to . I want to be as far away from you as I can be TOM Good . JEANNIE Yeah , " good . " Nice retort . TOM Just JEANNIE What an ass . ( Beat . ) I 'm sure you thought this would hurt me , right ? Like , " What 's the worst thing I 'd be able to do to her ? " And this is what you came up with , some self-image killer like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woe is me ! She 's fat , so does that mean that Tom secretly digs fat chicks , does it mean that I 'm fat ? ! Huh ? ! ! Is that what all this shit is about , getting back at me ? ! ! TOM Jeannie , get out of here ! NOW ! ! JEANNIE It does n't hurt me at all ! NOT ONE BIT ! ! It just makes you look like some creepy fucker and a totally odd AHHHHHH ! ! ! I do n't care . I hate you . HATE-YOU . So , so much . JEANNIE storms out of his office , leaving the door wide open . TOM does n't have the strength to close it ; he crosses to his couch instead and sits . Rubs his eyes . When he opens them , he sees CARTER standing at the door . p. 90 TOM Go away . Seriously . CARTER That 's not very neighborly . TOM Neighbors do n't treat neighbors this way . Enemies barely do CARTER Dude , it 's a joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CC'ing everybody on my e-mail about that one lady at lunch . And I did see the string of her tampon , by the way when she crossed her legs . ( Shivers . ) Damn ! TOM I 'm not kidding , Carter CARTER I thought Helen looked good blown up like that ! Several people I talked to said they were gon na keep it TOM Come on , man . Really . Just leave me alone today . CARTER Fine . But instead of leaving , CARTER goes and drops into TOM 'S chair and starts playing with it , swinging in circles and raising/lowering the seat mechanism . TOM If Moses had needed , like , another plague I would 've given him your number . CARTER I 'm flattered . TOM Do n't be . CARTER Bad day ? p. 91 TOM I 'm getting used to ' em . CARTER That 's why I 'm here . To be , like , a calming influence . TOM Great . If you 're my best chance , then I 'm screwed CARTER Nah . All will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O-kay . ( Beat . ) I do n't even need to ask you why you 're here CARTER Just chillin ' . TOM Uh-huh . Figured . The men sit in their respective spots for a bit , staring up at the ceiling . Finally , TOM speaks . TOM So , lemme ask you something , then . CARTER Shoot . TOM And honestly now just an opinion is all , so no big deal . CARTER I 'm ready . TOM What do you actually think of her ? Helen , I mean . CARTER Ummmmm TOM Not for you or , like , scoping her out down in Jamaica or that type of thing just as a person . CARTER Oh . Like that . p. 92 TOM Yes . CARTER sits back in the chair , thinking for a moment . CARTER You 're begging for trouble . TOM That 's why do I even ask you ? CARTER No , and I 'll tell you why ! I will . I know that I 'm not superfamiliar with her or anything , like , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are CARTER and that 's great . Terrific . But I 'm just talking purely as an " Is this a good deal for my pal here ? " thing . TOM Fine . And ? CARTER And you got a long road ahead , that 's all . Just being honest . TOM Fine . CARTER I 'm not saying I do n't admire you  --  I do , actually , ' cause I know that I could n't do it !  --  but she 's gon na end up a weight around your neck . Forgive the pun TOM You 're doing that strictly on a physical basis which is  --  CARTER Of course ! Fuck , what else can I go on ? ( Beat . ) I do n't wan na come off like some Elton John here , but you 're a good-looking guy . You 're successful , bit of a player in the industry I do n't understand you taking God 's good gifts and then pissing on ' em p. 93 TOM Carter CARTER Dude , you 're the one who evoked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that flood shit ! He did n't pair up the apes with the antelope , right ? It 's one of the many laws of nature . " Run with your own kind . " TOM That is so out of whack that I 'm , like , completely lost now CARTER Hey , it 's a free country , and if this is how you really feel , then you are fucking Gunga Din . " Better man than I am " and all that shit . Just do n't be surprised when you turn a few heads down at the mall . TOM But does n't she I mean , are n't people free to just ? Shit ! I du n no . I want her to be happy CARTER I 'm not saying she ca n't be happy . That she should n't meet somebody , but it ought a be a fat somebody , or a bald one . Whatever . Like her . A somebody that fits her TOM That 's crazy things are n't just based on appearance ! CARTER Maybe you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's should n't Helen deserve a , you know something ? Kindness . CARTER I 'm not talking about what people deserve , I 'm saying what they get . You look one way , you have access to all this . Look some other way , all you get is that . Sorry , but it 's true . p. 94 TOM Yeah , well , it sucks CARTER It 's whatever . Truth . People are not comfortable with difference . You know ? Fags , retards , cripples . Fat people . Old folks , even . They scare us or something . TOM I do n't think that 's true . I mean , I 'm not no , Carter , I do n't buy that . We 're all CARTER Then do n't . TOM Everybody 's different ! I mean CARTER Come on , be honest ! The thing they represent that 's so scary is what we could be , how vulnerable we all are . I mean , any of us . Some wrong gene splice , a bad backflip off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one step away from being what frightens us . What we despise . So we despise it when we see it in anybody else . TOM Old people , though ? Come on . We 're all gon na age . It 's CARTER Not me . I hope I 'm a goner before then . The elderly make me sick TOM This is you 're not helping me , Carter ! That 's the most depressing shit I 've ever heard . Seriously . CARTER holds up his hands and shrugs . TOM sits up on the couch , thinking . A bit lost . p. 95 CARTER All I 'm saying is this Do what you want . If you like this girl , then do n't listen to a goddamn word anybody says . Not one . ( Beat . ) But you 've got your whole life to be a positive person , okay ? To do some good in the community and be a bighearted fellow or whatever . Overlook people 's flaws and plant saplings and shit . But you 're only young once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck it up , that is all I 'm telling you here . Do n't take a complete dump on your one moment in the sun TOM Carter it 's not CARTER I 'm just babbling , anyway . Do n't listen to me The men nod at each other  --  agreeing to disagree . After another minute , CARTER stands . TOM You taking off ? CARTER Yeah , I should stuff an envelope or two ( Laughs . ) Listen TOM That 's a terrible way to start a sentence . CARTER What ? TOM Nothing . Go ahead . CARTER Look TOM laughs at this . CARTER does n't get it and goes on . p. 96 CARTER Whatever . I wanted to ask you this first , before you hear from I 'm gon na take Jeannie to that beach deal coming up . Is that cool ? TOM Ummm sure . No , of course . CARTER I mean , no weirdness for us ? TOM None . I think you two could just might be perfect for each other . CARTER Yeah , me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started going to a gym , so that 's something . TOM Uh-huh . CARTER I mean , you know her body , right ? Some potential . TOM Course . CARTER Anyway as long as we 're still TOM Sure . I think we 'll remain exactly what we are . You and me . CARTER Friends , right ? TOM Sorta . ( Gestures with his fingers . ) About this much CARTER Good enough for me . CARTER starts for the door . TOM gets up , and they shake hands awkwardly . A pat on the shoulder . CARTER reaches into a shirt pocket and hands TOM the photo of HELEN that he took before . Leaves . TOM crosses to his office windows and slowly closes all the blinds . One by one . The room grows darker . TOM goes to the couch and lies down . Holds the picture in front of him . Brings it closer now , staring at it . Hard. @x A stretch of sand . TOM , in a flowered swimsuit , sitting alone on a towel . Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEANNIE approaches . She is looking fit and is wearing a skimpy bikini . She towers over him . JEANNIE Thought that was you . TOM Yeah . Hey . ( Jumps up . ) You look good . I mean , nice . JEANNIE Thanks . Yeah I 'm doing Pilates now . ( Beat . ) How come you guys are sitting way down here ? TOM Oh , we 're just little privacy , I suppose . Edge of the group is all . JEANNIE Ah . Cool . TOM So ( Beat . ) You and Carter , huh ? JEANNIE Yeah , how ' bout that ? ! TOM It 's good . JEANNIE I hope so . He 's actually okay once you get him outta the office TOM Most people are . That 's not , like , the best environment for a person . Those cubicles p. 99 JEANNIE Probably not .

TOM We 'll see . Thanks , though . HELEN Yes , we appreciate it . And very nice to meet you JEANNIE You , too . So long , Tom . TOM Okay . Bye , Jeannie JEANNIE throws one last look at TOM , then heads off down the beach toward the others . TOM sits down on the blanket with the food . HELEN follows in a moment , out of breath . p. 101 TOM So . That 's Jeannie . HELEN She 's seems nice . TOM Yeah . Pretty much . HELEN What 's that mean ? TOM Oh , ya know have our differences at work sometimes , that 's all . HELEN Ahh . TOM Food looks good . Thanks for going down there HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sighs . ) Ohhh !

HELEN Same ol ' stuff . Does n't matter . p. 102 TOM Of course it does . Of course tell me . HELEN Look where we 're at . I mean , Tom , it 's forget it . ( Holds up a hot dog . ) Ketchup ? TOM This is n't Helen , I just wanted to get us near the dunes here , so we 'd have a little protection from the wind . That 's all . HELEN Tom TOM I 'm serious ! HELEN But we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced you to people HELEN In the parking lot ! As you and I were unloading stuff out of the car . That 's not an introduction . TOM Shit . I knew this would happen ! HELEN You knew it would happen because you know who you are , Tom . I do n't think you 're ready for this . TOM Come on , I do n't wan na Just eat something , all right ? We should n't fight . HELEN It 's not fighting , Tom . When you and I talk , that 's not fighting . It 's talking . That 's what people do . TOM Whatever . HELEN You want me to cry instead ? Huh ? Or scream and pull your hair , is that better , more what you 're used to ? ! ( Beat . ) Tom what 's going on ? p. 103 TOM Nothing . HELEN I told you weeks ago I said to you that you needed to be honest . More than anything else . TOM I know . I know that HELEN But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop now ! Shit this is my company picnic , okay ? We 're supposed to be having some fun . HELEN " Fun . " Okay ( She slowly stands . ) Let 's go join in the big game . HELEN jumps up and down a few times , miming a few shots as TOM watches . He looks over to where his friends are . HELEN Come on , Tom ! It 's fun ! ! TOM Stop it ! Stop ! ! ( Grabs her . ) Helen , please stop that . HELEN Fine . Then let 's chat , okay ? ( She sits again . ) Because it 's pretty damn hard to sit out here with a smile plastered on my face TOM All right . They sit in silence for a moment , then HELEN reaches over and grabs a piece of chicken . Starts to eat . HELEN I ca n't help it . I eat when I get stressed out p. 104 TOM It 's fine . Me , too . Sorta . HELEN So TOM You first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Tom , you are aware that I like you . You already know that . TOM Yes . HELEN But I get the feeling I mean , it is now pretty obvious that there are some problems here . Issues , or whatever . And we need to get over them or well , you know . Things that I do n't wan na think about . TOM I guess . HELEN Please , you need to stay in this . Focused on it , so do n't drift off or anything . I like you so much , I really do , Tom . Feel a connection with you that I have n't allowed myself to dream of , let alone be a part of , in so long . Maybe ever . But I ca n't be with you if you 're feeling something other than that same thing that I am completely and utterly open to that other person . I do n't know what to say here , Tom I 'm nervous . And sad and worried sick . Look at me when did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me ? Huh ? ( Tries to chuckle . ) I know you hate those jokes , sorry , but I 'm Tom , tell me about it . I know you 're thinking something , so we might as well just one more thing . Just this . And I 've never said this to anyone , not any other person in the world . Ever . My parents or a no one . ( Beat . ) I would change for you . I would . Go on Slim-Fast , or do that diet that the guy on TV did with the sandwiches from Subway . That guy . I will lose weight for you if you want me to . Or have some surgery or whatever it takes  --  one of those rings  --  because I do not want this to end . So I 'm willing to do that . Because of what you mean to me . The kind of , just , ecstasy that you 've brought me . So I just wanted you to know that . TOM sits there , taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elbow . p. 105 HELEN This would be an excellent time to say something sweet to me . If you at all care about my feelings . TOM I know . I 'm ( Beat . ) Helen , that was such a nice thing to offer . HELEN Oh-my-God TOM What ? HELEN I just the way you worded that right then , in the past tense . It scared me . TOM No , I just it is . Really . And I appreciate it so much . HELEN But what ? ( Beat . ) Gosh , I wish those thousand ships would show up right about now TOM Right . ( Tries to smile . ) Look , I 'm gon na I know I should n't start things that way , with " look , " but I 've been thinking HELEN Okay . TOM Listen I 'm just gon na say it , because I will not be able to get through if I do it slow or try not to hurt your feelings or anything . So here goes . Picnic be damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what I basically learned from our time together . I am a weak person , and I do n't know if I can overcome that . No , maybe I do know . Yeah . I do know that I am , and I ca n't overcome it , I mean . I think you are an amazing woman , I honestly do . And I really love what we 've had here . Our time together But I think that we 're very different people . Not just who we are  --  jobs or that kind of thing  --  but it does play into it as well . Factors in . We probably should 've realized this earlier , but I 've been so happy being near you that I just sorta overlooked it and went on . I did . But I feel it coming up now , more and more , and I just think  --  No , that 's bullshit , actually , the whole work thing . Forget it . ( Beat . ) I 'm just , I feel that we should maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say this , because in many ways I 'm already in so deep . Care about you a lot , and that makes it superhard . But  --  p. 106 HELEN Tom TOM No , I need to tell you . Be clear about how I feel . Honest . ( Beat . ) If we were in some other time or a land that nobody else was around on like that island from the movie , the Sinatra film , None but the Brave , if we 'd found ourselves stranded on some tropical island like that , then everything might be okay , I would n't be so fucking paranoid about what the people around me are saying . Or even thinking . Then it could just be you and me , and that would be so great . Perfect . But just like that movie  --  I mean , the whole deal fell apart when other soldiers showed up . The little paradise they had going could n't survive  --  forget it , that sounds so dumb , and I 'm just trying to find a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my peers think about me . Or how they view my choices and , yes , maybe that makes me not very deep , or petty , or some other word , hell , I do n't know ! It 's my Achilles flaw or something . It does n't matter . What I 'm sure of is this  --  we need to stop . Stop seeing each other or going out or anything like that . Because I know now how weak I am and that I 'm not really deserving of you , of all you have to offer me . I can see that now . Helen things are so tricky , life is . I want to be better to do good and better things and to make a proper sort of decision here , but I I ca n't . I can not do it . I mean , I could barely drive out here today because of my hands were shaking the whole time . They were . Jumping up and down on the wheel there . And these are all people that I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do this , on , like , a daily basis . ( Starts to cry . ) God , look at me ! It 's I 'm sorry about this , and I wish that I was saying what you wan na hear . I do . That would make me really happy , to please another person right now . I mean , you . To please you but I 'm not actually capable of it . At this point in my life . I know that if I were to promise you things  --  agree to your doing stuff , the kinds of stuff that you just told me about  --  sure , we 'd maybe limp along for a bit . Make this work for a while . A go of it . But it 'd only be a temporary ' cause I know me . I would start hanging out with my friends , or be looking at other girls , or maybe even worse , and I 'm not gon na do that to you . I will not be the guy who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this love for . Yeah , love . But sometimes it is n't enough . You know ? All this love inside and it 's not nearly enough to get around the shit that people heave at you . I feel like I 'm drowning in it  --  shit  --  and I do n't think I can I do n't wan na fight it anymore . I 'm not strong enough for that , and so I 'm just gon na lay on my back for a while and float . See if I can keep my head above the surface . ( Beat . ) I guess that is what I 've been meaning to say to you , for a while now . That I 'm not strong . I 'm not . I am a weak and fearful person , Helen , and I 'm not gon na get any better . Not anytime soon , at least They sit quietly , not touching . TOM is still tearful. p. 107 HELEN But that 's it 's something we could work on , right , Tom ? Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can and that we 'll please say we can . Tom , please just say that we please . We can , ca n't we ? Tom ? Ca n't we ? TOM No . I do n't think I can . HELEN starts to say something else but catches herself . HELEN begins to cry . TOM continues to cry as well . Big , rolling tears now as he places his head on her shoulder . Weeping . Silence . Darkness
