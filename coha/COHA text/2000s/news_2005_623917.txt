<p> Barney Jones has been a musician all his life . He sings , composes and works as a sound designer and recording engineer . His credits are substantial , but when he sings with a local Arabic choir , he admits , " I have anxiety that I sound like a total dork to the Arabs . " <p> Jones is a member of Aswat , a multicultural ensemble of singers and musicians who play Arabic , Turkish and Andalucian music . It 's a unique amalgam , even among the richly diverse community of Bay Area musicians and choral groups . Roughly half the members are ethnic Arabs  --  Jordanian , Iraqi , Syrian , Palestinian and Algerian  --  while the other half , like Jones , are Americans with European roots . <p> Aswat , which performs at 8 p.m . Saturday at Mills College , was founded five years ago by Nabila Mango , a San Mateo psychotherapist , singer and educator . From the onset , Mango sought to combine Western and Arab members in the group and to encourage American singers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a bridge for both groups to connect to the other , " says Mango , who emigrated from Palestinian territory in 1965 and teaches Arabic language at Skyline College in San Mateo . " For most of us , it 's very therapeutic . " <p> At a recent evening rehearsal at the Arab Cultural Center in San Francisco , Mango took on the role of mother hen : rushing about , looking after everyone 's comfort , making sure a guest was well fed . She 's a live wire , an energy source , and the group seems to draw its emotional cues and lightheartedness from her . <p> Fifteen vocalists filled the center of the room , joking between songs , accompanied by a nay ( a nine-jointed cane flute ) , Arabic tabla ( goblet-shaped drum ) , riqq ( a small tambourine ) , qanan ( 75-stringed zither ) , two ouds ( similar to a lute or guitar ) and two kamans ( violins ) . <p> One of the oud players , Saed Muhssin , is Aswat 's musical director . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 years ago , Muhssin selects the repertoire and calls himself " kind of a purist . " He programs only folkloric and classical compositions and wo n't abide contemporary Arabic pop , " which has become almost indistinguishable from Indian popular music or Western popular music . It gives up all the fine details of intonation . " <p> Mango started the group , she says , to foster cultural harmony and counter negative stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims . " There is so much twisted information about Arabs in this country . I thought about how to reach Americans and tell them about the contributions of Arab civilization or Islamic civilization  --  to try to make them understand who I am . " <p> The best way to reach their hearts , Mango decided , was through music . " People are much less judgmental when you present to them the cultural aspect and much more judgmental when you talk about religion or politics . So I started with a choir because music is the universal language , right ? The language of the soul . " <p> Mango @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see what would happen when American singers not only stand side by side with Arabic singers , but take on solo parts at each concert . " We would never ask an American to do a solo unless we feel they 're really ready , musically and pronunciation-wise . " <p> For some , it 's a shock to hear Arabic sounds emerging from Western mouths . " The Arab community are extremely fascinated when they hear the Americans do solo , " Mango enthuses . " Just beyond themselves . Like , ' How could they learn this impossible language and master the music ? ' " <p> Only once , Muhssin says , has anyone complained . It happened last weekend at a Women 's Building concert in San Francisco , where an American sang each solo for a Levantine classical piece . " He said , ' You guys destroyed the song because they 're not Arab and they 're singing this traditional song and you ca n't do this . ' My response was pretty much , ' Thank you for your feedback . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a wonderful job with a really complicated vocal part . " <p> Creating the right sound is tough , says Barney Jones , a tall , redheaded man who was born in Turkey  --  the son of a Foreign Service officer  --  and lived in the Middle East his first 10 years . " Singing in America and in Europe is all about vowels , while Arabic singing , like the language , revels in the consonants . " Probably the hardest consonant to get your mouth around is called the ' ayn . ' It is made by gently constricting the throat and then snapping it open , and it always leads to a vowel . Americans usually sound like they 're gagging when they first try it . " <p> For Westerners , there 's also a long learning curve with the Maqamat , an Arabic system of scales and modes that includes complicated quarter notes . But for Mango , there 's nothing even slightly odd about cross-cultural musical exploration : " It 's just like the opera , right ? If you have a musical ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can relate to it . It gets into your soul and bones and everything  --  so what 's wrong with that ? " <p> After Sept. 11 , 2001 , Aswat lost a lot of members , both Arabs and Americans . " People were afraid to come to the building , to the Arab Cultural Center , " Mango says . " They were afraid to be affiliated with an Arab group . But my decision was : ' We 're not going to stop . We 're not going to give in . ' " <p> " The Arab Cultural Center received threats , " Muhssin adds . " People were afraid to be there . So , in addition to all the sadness I had because of what happened on Sept. 11 , I was also saddened by the reactions of people going home and hiding , basically . That was the opposite lesson of what we should learn . We should n't isolate ourselves ; otherwise , we keep alive the suspicion . And suspicion is the cancer that causes people to do horrible things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to Jones , says she was drawn to Aswat in part because of its potential for community healing . " When Westerners hear the word ' Arab , ' they sometimes feel fear . I understood this because most of the information I had about Arabs tended to promote that . I knew this ancient culture has great beauty to share  --  it 's just that I had n't been exposed to it . So I joined Aswat . " <p> At her first rehearsal , " that fear rose again and I asked myself , ' What am I doing here ? ' It also occurred to me that I had never had a conversation with an Arab before . Living in a diverse community like San Francisco , I found this surprising . The Arabs in Aswat were very warm , gentle and welcoming towards me . That relaxed me , so that at the second rehearsal , when Saed asked me to sing a solo in a language I had never heard before , I was open to it . " <p> Once she got comfortable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't experienced in Western music . " Because Arabic music has many extra notes compared to Western scales , I felt like a bird in flight  --  swooping up and down as I sang . Then I realized , ' Ah , this freedom is the beauty . ' " <p> Freedom , and in some cases unexpected connections . This year , Jones was in Chicago when he noticed the driver of his cab was an Arabic man . " Turned out he was from Iraq . So I said , ' Hey , do you know this song ? ' and started singing ' treed minneh ti fah ' and he hooted and joined right in . <p> " There were three songs that we knew in common , so we kept singing and missed the exit on the freeway . Of course he turned off the meter . It was a truly exhilarating experience . " <p> Aswat performs at 8 p.m . Saturday at the Concert Hall at Mills College , 5000 MacArthur Blvd. in Oakland . Tickets are $12 general , $6 seniors , available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians who play a mix of Middle Eastern music , include Devi-ja Delgado Croll ( front ) and Hussain Dixon . / Liz Hafalia / The Chronicle
