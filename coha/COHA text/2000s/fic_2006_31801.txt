Chapter One Dingo Whaley was the first to spot the vehicle in the distance . He had to squint a little in the bright Texas sunshine and still could not be sure if it was a wagon or carriage . " What is it , boss ? Buffalo ? " " Shut up for a minute , Murdock , and let me think . " Pierce watched the scene from several feet away . He knew that Mel Murdock was not the brightest individual in Texas and would probably not listen to Dingo 's command . Pierce did n't like Murdock-almost nobody in the gang did-so he sat back to watch the show . Murdock did n't disappoint him . Murdock spit a stream of tobacco juice and continued , " Hell , I 'm so sick of seeing the rump end of those shaggy beasts , I 'd sure like to get the tail end of something a sight prettier ! When are we going to hit some town- " Without a second 's hesitation , Dingo reached out and hit Murdock with a solid backhanded slap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it knocked the other man out of his saddle . He landed on his feet , started to reach for the gun at his side . Pierce scratched the stubble on his face , laughed softly . Murdock glanced at Pierce , then at Dingo , who was apparently ignoring him . Murdock took his hand away from the gun . Though both men were over six feet tall and had thewell-worn look of buffalo hunters , Dingo was the bulkier of the two . He weighed in at over three hundred pounds of bone and muscle . He was said to be the best fighter and one of the fastest shots in the West . Murdock and other members of his gang knew he was also mean as sin . He was a bad man to tangle with . " I thought I said to be quiet . " " Sure , boss . I did n't mean to- " " Just shut up . " Pierce laughed as Murdock got back on his horse and rode off . Pierce had no sympathy for the other man . Dingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally made out details of a single coach followed by a single rider . If it was another sodbuster , a raid would hardly be worth the effort . A more fancy rig could mean a merchant with a hidden cash box or some merchandise that could come in handy . In any case , Murdock did have a point . Dingo and his men had seen too many damned buffalo . The last big hunt had been just a few days before . It was good money-real good money . But the work was hard and tiring . Now it was time for a different kind of sport and maybe some easier money . Another member of the gang rode up and stopped beside Pierce . He looked almost frail compared to the larger men , though he was not a small man and closer inspection revealed that he also had been hardened by years of living in the open country . " What 's cooking ? " the third man asked quietly . " Boss is in a cranky mood , Jessup . Would n't rile him , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again ? " He laughed . " You think he 'd learn sooner or later . " " I know I do n't plan on pissing off Dingo . I value my hide too much . " " Me too . Crossing Dingo Whaley is one thing nobody in their right mind would ever do . " Dingo turned his horse and rode the few feet back to the other two men . " Jessup , you 're familiar with this country . How close would you say we are to the nearest town ? " " There 's a settlement or two within a half-day 's ride of here . " Jessup absently scratched himself as he thought . " The nearest town of any size is San Angelo . Only thing much there is Fort Concho , which means you can buy beer and women . " " I 'm more concerned about the law . " " Hell , there may be a Ranger or two . Ca n't get away from those bastards these days . But the soldiers ? The damned fort ai n't big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of those are new recruits who could n't find their way home with a map . Rangers and soldiers are pretty busy with the Indians and Mexicans , anyway . " " Sounds good to me . Pierce , get the rest of the boys together . We 're going to pay us a visit to those pilgrims down yonder . " Sam Two-Wolves shook his head slightly as his horse made its way through rotting corpses at the site of a recent buffalo hunt . The horse was skittish , and the smell was terrible , but Sam 's firm hand kept the horse steady . From several hundred feet away , Matt Bodine sat on his own horse . For once , he made no wisecracks , for he knew the ache that such a sight produced in Sam . He had a similar feeling in his own heart since they shared a common cultural heritage , as blood brothers . For many Indians , the buffalo was the source of life itself , and with the killing of the buffalo their life was also disappearing . Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cheyenne , his mother a beautiful and highly educated white woman from the East who had fallen in love with the handsome chief and married him in a Christian ceremony . As an Indian , Sam was deeply aware of the bond between men and nature , between Indian and buffalo . Matt was the son of a rancher and met Sam when they were both just kids . The two quickly became friends , with Matt spending as much time in the Cheyenne camp as he was on the ranch at home . They grew up together , and Matt was adopted into the tribe as a True Human Being , according to Cheyenne belief . Matt and Sam were joined by a ritual of knife and fire . Though Matt 's background was different than Sam 's , he understood his blood brother 's feelings better than most . Their relationship was an easy one , often filled with good-natured kidding , but they could prove to be a terrible foe . On such occasions , Sam 's obsidian eyes grew cold and Matt 's temper could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handsome and muscular , over six feet tall and weighing over two hundred pounds , though Sam 's hair was black and Matt 's was brown . They worked together individually and as a team , after having survived dozens of fights and shoot-outs in their travels across the West in which they were now earning the reputation of gunfighters . They came by their fighting ability honestly . Sam 's father , Medicine Horse , had been killed during the Battle of the Little Big Horn after he charged Custer , alone , unarmed except for a coup stick . Realizing the inevitability of war , the chief had ordered Sam from the Indian encampment before the battle , to adopt the white man 's ways and to forever forget his Cheyenne blood . That was a promise that Sam had a difficult time keeping . Matt and Sam had witnessed the subsequent slaughter at the Little Big Horn , though that was a secret only they shared . During the time following the death of Sam 's father , Sam and Matt decided to drift for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . Though they were often mistaken for out-of-work drifters , in truth the two men were well-educated and wealthy . Sam Two-Wolves was college-educated , while Matt had been educated at home by his mother , a trained schoolteacher . Sam 's mother had come from a rich Eastern family and left him with many resources . Matt had earned his fortune through hard work and smart business moves . He rode shotgun for gold shipments and as an army scout , then invested his money in land . Matt and Sam now owned profitable cattle and horse ranches along the Wyoming-Montana border . " You ca n't do anything about this now , " Matt called out to Sam . " Let 's move on . " " I know , " Sam answered . " But this is such a waste . I 'd like to get my hands on the men that did this . " " Yeah . So would I. But it 's all legal , sanctioned and encouraged by the government . " Sam urged his horse down the road at a faster pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here before I get sick . " Matt looked around , shook his head , then hurried to catch up . He would give Sam a few miles to regain his natural good humor . Sometimes it was better not to push , and this was one of those times . Peter Easton shuffled some papers around on the makeshift desk in front of him . His ample stomach made the maneuver difficult . Carl Holz , Easton 's assistant , knowing Easton 's sensitivity to his weight , said nothing . The carriage shifted on the rocky ground , tossing the papers into the air . Easton tried to grab them , as did Holz . " Damn ! How 's a man supposed to get any work done in these conditions ! " " I suggest again , sir , that you might be better off postponing work until you reach Fort Concho , " Holz said . " All the pertinent information is in the summary I prepared for you . " Holz was much slimmer than Easton , though his hair was also slicked back and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper from beneath another stack and handed it to his superior . Easton repositioned his glasses and again read through the report . " Damn these Mexicans anyway , " he said . " They ca n't control their own bandits and they get upset because one or two of our men cross the border in pursuit . Harumph ! " " One man in particular , " Holz corrected . " A Texas Ranger named Josiah Finch . " He reached into the stack and pulled out another slip of paper , glanced down a list . " I might point out that the complaints are n't limited to just Mexican authorities . The Department has received complaints from Indian Territory , New Mexico ... " " I get the idea . This Ranger does n't understand limits-though I understand that all these Texans think they 're too good to follow the rules . I 'll conduct my investigation , make my recommendations , and get back to Washington as soon as possible . " He looked out the window at the dry countryside . " I 'd just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had left that senator 's wife alone ... " A gunshot that sounded like a cannon suddenly filled the air and a hole exploded in the side of the wagon , filling the inside with splintered wood . This time the papers scattered and nobody bothered to pick them up as the horses spooked and started to run down the road . Easton and Holz hit the floor as another shot made a second hole in the side . Outside , Dingo Whaley and his men were quickly overtaking the vehicle . The escort on horseback squeezed off a shot at the attackers , who returned the fire . A half-dozen bullets hit him at the same time and he fell to the ground . The driver , not willing to be a hero and be shot for his efforts like the escort had been , tried unsuccessfully to stop the team . Dingo solved that problem by aiming his big buffalo gun at the lead horse and squeezing off a shot . It dropped in its tracks , causing the remaining frightened horses to stumble and fall . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dingo started to take aim , tracking the body as he might a flying duck , then lowered the gun and turned his attention back to the wagon . The hitch broke and the wagon overturned in a cloud of dust and noise . It had been many miles since Matt and Sam had left the buffalo carcasses , but Sam was still quiet . " I could sure go for a hot meal and a cold beer , " Matt said . " I 'm sick and tired of this trail grub . Why , that breakfast we had this morning was- " " You cooked breakfast , " Sam answered . " Oh . Right . Well , what about that dinner yesterday ... " " You cooked dinner yesterday , " Sam answered . " Damn right ! Maybe it 's time you did some of the cooking ! " " What ? And listen to your griping ? " But Sam smiled , and Matt grinned in return . " That 's more like it , " Matt said . " You 're mighty poor company when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My moods ! Hell , even at my worst , I 'm better than you are when you get all goggle-eyed over some saloon singer ... " Matt shook his head . " Well , now I 've done it ! You 're back to normal . Me and my big mouth ! All you need now is a good fight to put you in a really fine mood ! " The shot of a buffalo gun roared in the distance . " As you were saying , brother , my mood 's rapidly improving ! " Sam said , as he turned his horse and raced toward the sound . Matt rolled his eyes toward the sky . " Me and my big mouth ! " Chapter Two Carl Holz touched his forehead and felt wet . He pulled back his hand and saw blood . When he volunteered to assist Easton in his department investigation , as a " favor " to an influential senator , Holz had hoped to make some points for himself to further his career . He had not planned on getting shot at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking into the barrel of a Colt revolver held by one of the biggest men he had ever seen . Others had their guns pointed at Easton . " Come on out , nice and easy , " one of the men said . " I have n't decided whether or not to shoot you . If you cooperate , we might let you walk away . " Holz groaned and pulled himself out of the carriage . Easton was trying to take control , though west Texas and a gang of outlaws were much different than the Washington , D.C. , society that he was familiar with . At least a dozen men , all wearing masks , held guns on them . " Who are you ? And what do you want ? " " Names are n't no matter , " Dingo replied . " And what I want is your watches . Your money . Anything that you might have stashed in that fancy wagon of yours . " " Outlaws ! " Holz said . " I 'll handle this , " Easton hissed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another outlaw asked . " Then handle this ! " His massive fist snaked out and hit Easton , who fell backward in a daze . Easton kept his eye on him , trying to clear his head . " Murdock , cut it out , " the first outlaw said . " Pierce , you take some of the boys and take this fancy rig apart . The rest of you boys take whatever valuables you can find off these yahoos . " " Can I beat up on them some , too ? " Murdock asked . " Just do what you 're told . " Holz was amazed to see Pierce and three others manually set the carriage upright again . Some of the papers that Easton had been working on fluttered to the ground through the open door . " What 's this ? " Dingo demanded , kicking one of the sheets with a dirty boot . " You some kind of lawyers or something ? " " We 're with the government , " Easton said . He was still on the ground , rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " Dingo motioned to a smaller man . " Jessup , gather together some of these papers . It might prove interesting reading on some cold night . " He laughed and pounded his fist on his knee . " You ca n't do that ! It 's government property ... " Murdock ripped the watch from Easton 's pocket and pushed him back to the ground . He pulled his gun and aimed it at Easton 's head . " Are n't we citizens ? " Jessup asked calmly . " Ah , well ... convicted felons do lose certain rights ... " Jessup walked over and grabbed Easton 's shirt collar . " What makes you think we 're felons ? " " Ah , well ... " " Maybe you should apologize ? " " Of course . My mistake . " " ... and citizens with every right ! " Holz finished . From inside the carriage came a whoop , and one of the men came out holding a heavy bag . It clinked as he walked . " We struck paydirt , boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold coin ! " Holz sighed . It had been his idea to bring along the gold to help with expenses . In the West , he knew , government IOUs were n't always considered acceptable currency . The loss of the gold could be a mark against him . Even so , he was n't going to get himself killed over it , though he should at least make an effort . " Anything else ? " the leader of the band asked . " You realize that this is a federal offense ? " Holz asked . " It makes me shiver in my boots ! " Dingo laughed again . Holz said nothing more . " Now answer my question . Anything else of value here ? " " Nothing . You 've cleaned us out . " " What about these yahoos ? Should we shoot them ? " " Why waste bullets ? We 're miles from anywhere . These tenderfoots wo n't last a day ... " Dingo stopped in midsentence as he seemed to listen to the air . Some said he could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him one of the more dangerous buffalo hunters , and outlaws , working in that part of Texas . " We 're getting company , " he announced . " I do n't know how many , but I think we 've had enough fun for one day . Let 's get out of here . " Murdock laughed and added , " You 're right , Dingo ! Let these greenhorns stew in their own fat ! " The others also guffawed as they quickly mounted and started to ride . Holz knew Easton was sensitive about his weight , but was still surprised to see Easton unexpectedly stand and jump at the outlaw who made the comment about him being fat . He grabbed the outlaw 's legs and tried to drag him from the saddle . The outlaw was apparently even more surprised . He looked down at his attacker , kicked , and lost his balance . He hit the ground with a thud . The other members of the gang did n't even bother to look back as they rode away . ( Continues ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
