<p> The one thing Jonathan Winters wants you to know right away , even before you 've moved beyond the tiled entrance foyer of his house : He 's not crazy . <p> Moments after the handshake , he launches into a many-voiced shtick alternately describing , making fun of and setting the record straight on his long-discussed mental state . It used to be called manic-depression , what he has . Now it 's bipolar disorder . It keeps being upgraded to sound more respectable , he jokes . Sure , he had two breakdowns , but those happened 40 years ago . Nothing since . It 's not just the lithium , either ; it 's finding out what 's important in life  --  rearing your kids , enjoying your homelife , reconciling with the ghosts of your parents . <p> Whoa . <p> We 'd planned on asking about Maude Frickert and the stable of characters that made Winters a four-decade eminence in American comedy . We wanted to ask about Robin Williams and other contemporary comics who took their cue from Winters . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutty " issue , but we thought we 'd sit down first . <p> It 's understandable why Winters would be on the defensive . Yes , he 's the acknowledged father of improvisational stand-up , siring offspring such as Williams , Tracey Ullman , Lily Tomlin and Billy Crystal . <p> He helped invent the highly personal comic routine that expressed the comedian 's inner life in a sly and subtle way . Before Lenny Bruce and Sam Kinison mined their painful pasts and expressed it in the first-person monologue , Winters invented characters who voiced his . And in honor of his contribution , Winters last fall received the Kennedy Center 's second Mark Twain Prize for achievement as an American humorist . The event was taped to run at 9:30 p.m . Wednesday on cable 's Comedy Central . <p> But Winters , 74 , also became a poster boy for the romantic fine line between genius and insanity . In a business with fast and loose labels , Winters got stuck with the " crazy " epithet years ago . " Oh , yeah . Jon Winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " <p> Winters wants to know why he has been saddled with a rep for four decades , and it 's a fair question . Actors today have breakdowns and go on Larry King the next night , it seems . <p> " This is something I 've never quite shaken . There are bigger stars than me with all kinds of coke problems , sauce problems , guys that are married four , five times , " he says . " Then they put them in picture after picture . <p> " Why should I have to go through my life auditioning and proving I 'm sane ? " <p> That 's how Winters comes at you : all at once . Williams has claimed Winters as his mentor . ( " I told Robin , ' Do n't call me your mentor . People back in Ohio do n't know what that means . Call me your idol , ' " Winters deadpans . ) So think of talking to Winters as something like talking to Williams , only at 45 rpm instead of 78 rpm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumble , spiced with a Tabasco splash of sarcasm and outrage . He is no longer the Gatling gun mounted in Johnny Carson 's chair , but he still has some ammo . <p> Things have been quiet in Winters ' career for the last decade or so . <p> Twenty , 30 years ago , he appeared in movies , toured for club dates , did TV commercials . He seemed a weekly fixture on Carson . He was big . Now his career has slowed , if not his mind . He reads constantly , devouring news and history , particularly anything to do with Winston Churchill . He 'll still do an occasional 35 minutes of stand-up , or voice a cartoon , or take a small part in a movie , but his last regular work was the 1991-92 TV sitcom " Davis Rules , " which netted him his only Emmy . A 1988 book of short stories , Winters ' Tales , hit the best-seller lists . A 1992 comedy album , " The Wonderful World of Jonathan Winters , " won a Grammy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay Leno , and probably not because anybody thinks he 's crazy . It 's because , first , he has n't had a recent TV show or movie to publicize , but also he does n't " get " Letterman and Leno , and , likely , vice versa . Or he may be simply too slow for them now . Or it may be the difference between two eras and two kinds of funny . The difference between history and the present . <p> A tour of his house , down the coast from Santa Barbara , displays many icons of the past . He is surrounded by his era . <p> Over here is a 4-foot-long model of the USS California in a glass case . Signed , framed documents from all of the presidents hang impressively . His " special room " is a virtual armory of Civil War rifles and pistols on two walls ; on another , glass-cased autographed baseballs . To Jonathan , from : Ted Williams , Bob Feller , Joe DiMaggio . <p> And here is a photograph of Winters on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems near tears . He has signed it : " Jonathan : You are definitely not funny ! " <p> " Johnny and I , we were on the same frequency , " Winters says . " Not so with these guys . " <p> " These guys " are Letterman and Leno , the late-night hosts most responsible , along with Conan O'Brien , for keeping celebrities in the public eye nowadays . When Carson went , so , effectively , did Winters . " I found Leno extremely difficult to work with , " Winters says . <p> Carson gladly served as the straight man for Winters ' character-driven improvisations ; Leno 's scripted , punch-line-driven style is less compatible . It 's easy to paint Letterman as just a grouch . <p> In a way , though , Winters and Letterman might seem a perfect match . Despite the family-safe comedy he performs publicly ( " I just do n't get these guys with their filthy language , " Winters says of today 's profane comics ) , there is a dark edge to his private patois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grumpy but charming grandpa from the Midwest , who fully takes in the world but is nevertheless perplexed and somewhat soured by it . Or a stand-up Evelyn Waugh  --  a piercing satirist inventing characters merely to expose their lowbrow foolishness . <p> Frickert is probably Winters ' most famous character . The swinging grandma was a gray-bunned libertine whose promiscuous antics made ' 60s audiences howl . There also was the quack shrink , Dr. Bellenhoffer , and others , from Chester Honeyhugger to King Kwasi to Larry Lech . <p> Winters still practices his shtick in real life to take a few pokes at human nature . He recalls an encounter with yet another wiseacre who , for the one-millionth time , poked a finger at Winters ' ample belly and asked , hilariously , " When 's the baby due ? " <p> " I told him , ' If it 's a boy , we 're going to name him Joseph . If it 's a girl , we 're going to name her Geraldine . If it 's what I think it is , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to name it after you . ' " <p> The bit probably would n't play too well on Leno . <p> By the mid- ' 50s , Winters had left radio and TV jobs in Ohio for New York , where he had modest success doing celebrity impersonations . His big break came when an old show-biz guy told him : Stop doing celebrities like every other young comic . Invent characters you know , people you grew up with . Do them . <p> Soon he was a hot young comic , a fixture on TV and a wacky contemporary of Sid Caesar , Mel Brooks , Milton Berle and Imogene Coca . Winters became a regular on " The Garry Moore Show , " " Here 's the Show " and " The Steve Allen Show . " He got his own gig , " The Jonathan Winters Show , " on NBC in 1956 . He toured comedy clubs . He had a wife and two young children . And in 1958 , he quit drinking . " At 32 , my hands were shaking like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was drinking a half-gallon of liquor a day . <p> So he quit . But the anxiety did n't . He exacerbated the situation by downing 12 to 14 cups of coffee and Coke a day . In 1959 , he had his first breakdown , in San Francisco . He took two weeks off . Should have taken longer , he says , because two years later , he had a second one . This one cost him eight months in a clinic . He has taken lithium since then . It has been a long time since he had a manic episode , but he remembers what they feel like . <p> " I felt that I could read into things that were n't there , " he says . " It was a form of hallucinating . I would see people staring at me and think , ' Do they know what I 'm going through ? Are they trying to read my mind ? ' " <p> By the mid- ' 60s , Winters was back in the spotlight . He played a truck driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mad World " ( 1963 ) , perhaps Hollywood 's last madcap caper . He took a turn as twins in 1965 's " The Loved One , " the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh 's black novella , called by some critics one of the best comedies of the ' 60s . There was a part as a deputy in " The Russians Are Coming ! The Russians Are Coming ! " ( 1966 ) , the Cold War spoof . He had a second " Jonathan Winters Show , " this time on CBS , from 1967 to ' 69 . <p> Throughout the ' 70s , his appearances were limited to TV specials and the long-running Hefty garbage bag ads , in which he played a wacky " garbologist . " <p> His big re-emergence came in 1981 , when he appeared on ABC 's " Mork &; Mindy " as Mork 's son Mearth . Williams , who played Mork , had requested Winters . In 1992 , Williams told Playboy why Winters inspired him : <p> " It was like seeing a guy behind a mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way for him to talk about painful stuff . I found out later that they are people he knows  --  his mother , his aunt . He 's an artist who also paints with words ; he paints these people that he sees . " <p> Winters has no desire to do a weekly TV series anymore , he says . Besides , a pacemaker , implanted in 1988 , reminds him to take it easy . ( Winters collapsed in February of that year . When he came to , he was being given mouth-to-mouth by a male paramedic . The first thing out of Winters ' mouth was : " You 're a very attractive man . " ) <p> But Winters would like to do one more film . A strong supporting role in a comedy or drama ; does n't matter , as long as it 's good . But it may not come , not now . Winters  --  like so many other improvisationists , such as Tomlin and Martin Short  --  does n't fit Hollywood 's molds . <p> But there 's something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Oscar and a standing ovation , but they do n't give him a job , " says Timothy Gray , managing editor of Variety , the show business trade paper . " How many other 73-year-olds are working ? For better or worse , there 's not a lot of action for these people . " <p> So Winters browses the collectibles market in Hollywood on weekends . And assembles his autobiography . And paints . And endures " blue-hair parties " with his wife of 51 years , Eileen  --  his best friends are still in Ohio . <p> And he still has a little fun . <p> Last May , his wife put together a local fashion show for charity . The willowy models prowled the runway in their pret-a-porter . All went as expected , until the last model appeared at the end of the runway . It was a devilishly grinning Winters , dressed as swinging granny Maude Frickert , in the trademark dress , little round glasses and gray wig with the pulled-back bun . <p> And he brought down the house .
