Older and wiser , THE FORMER BUYOUT KINGS are still in the thick of the Wall Street action . An extraordinary inside look at how their firm has changed with the times . // After talking nearly nonstop about his business for more than two hours , Henry Kravis walks a visitor through Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &; Co. ' s elegant 42nd-floor Manhattan offices to a room called the library . To the right is a stunning view of Central Park . Directly ahead , on the west wall , is what we 've come to see : a large , framed graphic filled with logos of KKR deals-Safeway , Duracell , RJR Nabisco , Beatrice-and in the center a yellow deposit slip with which the legendary buyout firm , days after its founding on May 1 , 1976 , opened a checking account at Chemical Bank with $10,000 . The graphic , a gift from a top investment banker at J.P . Morgan Chase , celebrates KKR 's storied past and underscores the firm 's indelible mark on Wall Street history . While KKR did n't invent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of the field-the only firm that could have pulled off the $25 billion RJR Nabisco deal in 1989 , still the largest LBO on record . But RJR turned out to be a watershed , a costly and damaging miscue after which KKR went through a period of embarrassing sloppiness-misjudging markets and managements-that eroded its competitive position . Says Kravis : " Quite frankly , we got sort of arrogant and made some terrible mistakes . " One he has in mind is Regal Cinemas , which lost KKR and Hicks Muse a full $1 billion , a record for the buyout industry . ( We give you a rare , revealing look at KKR 's performance figures further on . ) Those mistakes eventually spurred Kravis and George Roberts , his partner , first cousin , and alter ego , into action . Around the start of this decade , they put on their boots and plowed into improving the ways in which the firm makes and rides herd on its investments . It 's still too soon to judge the success of that campaign-it takes time in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its flag in Europe and generally engaged in a ton of transactions . Since the beginning of 2004 , KKR has formed one new specialty printing and marketing company , Visant , and acquired control or a major stake in eight other corporations , including Sealy , PanAmSat , and power generator Texas Genco . And it has been vigorously cashing in some of its holdings , including its entire remaining stakes in Owens-Illinois and Walter Industries ( once called Jim Walter ) , which KKR amazingly had been in since 1987 . From all the sales made in 2004 , KKR returned $7 billion to its investors . As a bonus , Kravis and Roberts also contend , with some justification , that they have transformed KKR into a best-practices leader . Even some rivals make a bow to the firm 's resurgence . Said one recently : " KKR made so many bad deals for a while that it began to look as if it could n't hack it . " But , he says , " I have to hand it to them , because they 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally a competitor of KKR 's , though right now a partner in the big deal to buy SunGard Data Systems ( see preceding story ) , views KKR 's ups and downs as an arresting , long-run saga : " They were great in a precocious way ; they taught all the rest of us how to do it . Then they went into relative exile , and now , sort of like Winston Churchill , they 've come back . It 's a fascinating story . " Yet it has played out in ways that show how much Wall Street has changed since the 1980s . KKR no longer rules over the buyout field , which has too many jousting princes these days for any absolute monarch to emerge . And the firm has had to change the way it does business too . Instead of habitually engineering solo acquisitions , it is increasingly joining with other outfits in less risky club deals . Two cases in point : In a deal it first sought to win on its own , KKR ended up in March negotiating a $6.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners , Bain Capital and Vornado Realty . Next SunGard : No less than seven buyout firms , with Silver Lake in the lead , are to buy the company for $11.4 billion , an amount slated to make SunGard the second-biggest deal after RJR . If sharing the spotlight bothers Kravis and Roberts , they do n't show it . Indeed , though both are 61 and rolling in riches , they have absolutely no interest in retiring-they still live and breathe buyouts . That point was made abundantly clear throughout lengthy and unusual conversations that FORTUNE had this spring with these normally press-shy men . You ca n't miss another fact , either : Both are intense , hard-charging types who love to compete and are n't ready to concede an inch of advantage to their rivals . Says Roberts of KKR : " I still think we 're the best guys out there . " The cousins ( who split from their co-founder and mentor , Jerome Kohlberg , in 1987 ) continue to run the firm much as they always have . Roberts , who dislikes New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , now in Menlo Park . So four or five times a day , maybe , he and Kravis are talking business on the phone . The cousins have n't had an argument , claims Kravis , since they were 7 years old ( when they fought over who would get to ride young Henry 's new bicycle ) . But devil 's advocate each can be : " Usually if one of us loves an investment idea , " says Roberts , " the other will take a more challenging opinion . " In their personal lives , both endured losses . Roberts 's wife , Leanne , 57 , died two years ago . Kravis 's son , Harrison , died in a 1991 car accident when he was 19 . Two portraits of Harrison , dark-haired and handsome , hang in his father 's office conference room . In a better turn for Kravis , he is now happily married to his third wife , Marie-Jose , an economist and corporate director ( of Ford and InterActive Corp-and formerly of Hollinger ) . " The third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right . " Kravis and Roberts share certain outside interests-the contemporary art that decorates their offices , for example , and golf . Kravis was captain of his golf team at Claremont Men 's College , and if you give him an opening , he will tell you about a great shot he made while playing with Tiger Woods not long ago . Roberts , spurred to take up the sport by his friend Chuck Schwab , has in the past 15 years obsessively gone from rank beginner to a four handicap . Many evenings , after work , he can be found on the practice tee at Stanford University 's course , a few miles from his office . Physically , neither he nor Kravis casts a wide shadow while playing : Both are short and slight . But they are almost comically different in character . Roberts is soft-spoken and reserved , almost reclusive . Kravis is gregarious and hugely social . Roberts recalls that when the two were young bachelors and roommates in New York City , Kravis was out every night-a routine , says Roberts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NUMBERS SAY Their divergent social styles-and locations-have n't prevented them from building an exceptional track record . Being a private operation , KKR never broadcasts the details of its returns . But when the firm raises a new fund , as it is doing right now in Europe , it lays out its record in a private-placement memorandum that becomes its selling tool . FORTUNE secured one of these documents , 69 pages long , from a state pension fund that is an investor-a limited partner-in KKR 's deals . It provides an illuminating look at KKR 's performance . From its start in 1976 through September 2004 , KKR raised ten funds and sank $21 billion of its investors ' money ( including about $500 million from KKR partners and other insiders ) into 93 companies . Counting debt , it put a total of $130 billion into them . On these companies , it figures its profits as of September at $34.7 billion . Of that , $26 billion was realized profits and $8.7 billion was the firm 's estimate of profits there for the taking on 28 companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits , and more that had materialized , in the six months after September , when it engaged in a large round of successful selling . ) As for KKR 's lifetime batting average , the document has the firm making money on 62 companies ( including one that went bankrupt , builder Jim Walter ) ; losing on 22 ( including three bankrupts , Seaman 's Furniture , supermarket chain Bruno 's , and Regal Cinemas ) ; and square on nine , most of them recorded that way because they have been owned for only a short time . Says Roberts of the $34.7 billion in profits the firm has produced : " That 's probably more than our five or six biggest competitors have done combined . " Here 's how those profits translate into the two measures by which the buyout industry lives and dies . First , there 's " internal rate of return , " or IRR , a complex calculation that takes into account the flows of money in and out of an investment . KKR figures its annual IRR over the years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar profits to the money put up . Here , KKR through September had generated profits of $1.65 for every $1 invested ( though in the way the buyout business works , only a fraction of the $1 would have been invested at any one time ) . On the face of it , the figures look impressive , but a closer inspection shows that the long-term trend in the firm 's returns is not good . KKR 's first five funds ( see table ) produced huge returns , averaging , on a dollar-weighted basis , almost 37% . In the next four ( not including a $6 billion fund raised early this decade , because it has not yet matured ) , the weighted average fell to 16% . That 's obviously a prodigious drop . Only part of it , though , resulted from unadulterated poor performance-those " terrible mistakes " Kravis owns up to . The remaining part mainly reflects the disappearance of the easy pickings of the early years , when companies could be both bought cheaply and leveraged out of their skin . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1986 by putting up only $132 million of equity , a mere 3.1% of the purchase price . KKR , which has traditionally and sometimes controversially gone in for long holding periods , then clung to a stake in Safeway for no less than 17 years , eventually realizing $7.4 billion in profits-the firm 's biggest dollar triumph by far . Deals like that just do n't come around much anymore . It 's even more crucial to note that the profits are gross-they do n't reflect KKR 's cut , or " carry , " and certain fees the firm charges . In fact , by any measure KKR does better for itself than for the investors who put up most of the money for its deals-and this is a principal and greedy trait that buyout funds share with hedge funds . In the early days , when KKR could pretty much dictate its terms , its carry was 20% of the realized profits of each deal and 0% of any losses-as close to a free lunch as you can get . Today , because the limited partners rioted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire fund 's returns , which leaves KKR sharing in any losses-a significant change . So what part of that $26 billion in realized profits went to KKR ? Hard to say , but $5.2 billion would appear to be a minimum and maybe $5.5 billion the max . The profits that the KKR folk have taken in from the carry are by far the juiciest part of their dollar story , but not all of it . Like hedge funds , buyout firms also get a management fee , which these days may run from 1% to 1.5% of the funds that investors have committed to put up . Going back to the 1980s and early 1990s , KKR also raked in 100% of certain fees it charged its companies ( for simply " monitoring " them and for M &A; transactions ) . But today , because its limited partners got irritated about what KKR was siphoning out of deals the partners were financing , the limiteds get maybe 55% to 80% of those fees . So from the viewpoint of a KKR , taking into account its lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been a certain long-term deterioration in the economics . But do not weep for these folks . The funds meanwhile rise in size , which increases both the fees they throw off and the potential carry . So think of the KKRs of the world as earning profits that are " gross " by another dictionary definition : " excessively fat . " Kravis and Roberts 's share of those profits has naturally declined over the years as they have admitted other partners-14 of them today , all technically " members " of a limited-liability corporation-into the firm ( which , by the way , still has a 1% owner named Jerry Kohlberg ) . Still , one source who knows the workings of the firm estimates that from the carry and other profits , each of the cousins has received at least $2 billion after tax-and , he says , " I could be low . " Furthermore , they have probably banked most of that money : While many hedge fund principals have much of their net worth invested in their funds , that is not normally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its firms have to keep hitting the road to raise money . Why do the limited partners pay the freight ? Because they expect the buyout funds to deliver " excess returns " over what they might earn in the stock and bond markets . It 's worth pointing out that the " limiteds , " as they are called , could very likely drum up at least equal excess returns were they willing to play the leverage game themselves by loading up on S &P; index futures . But pension funds , being fiduciaries , do n't like to speculate that way . Instead , they line up at the doors of buyout funds . From the beginning , KKR 's key investors-bound to the firm with almost religious devotion-have been the investment arms of two states , Washington and Oregon . Both figure their annual returns from KKR over the years to have exceeded 16% , which they think both entirely satisfactory and a reason for them to dig deeply when KKR periodically brings its collection plate around . Their latest act of fealty occurred early in this decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Millennium fund and ran into two problems : first , resistance from investors because of KKR 's recent spotty record , and second , the fierce blow of 9/11 . In the end Oregon stepped in with an unprecedented investment of $1 billion , and Washington topped that with $1.5 billion . So of the $6 billion fund KKR raised , two investors amazingly account for just over 40% of its dollars . No problem , says Joseph Dear , executive director of Washington 's investment board : " KKR has a demonstrated capacity to show good returns . " THE LEAN YEARS There was a time when the returns went south , and it started with KKR 's ill-starred 1989 acquisition of RJR Nabisco . After a slugging match between the company 's management and KKR to see who would take this huge company private , KKR " won , " so to speak-handing over the $25 billion . Ultimately , in three swatches , the firm put $3.7 billion of equity into RJR and a related deal , Borden . The $3.7 billion was also a remarkable 60% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 fund . But that deal ran into big trouble from tobacco litigation and bond market woes , and the firm 's investors lost an ugly $958 million . KKR fared better : It was not then sharing in losses , and it reaped almost $200 million in fees from RJR and Borden . Even so , the results were humiliating . That is still evident a decade later as Kravis , sitting in his paneled conference room , shares his rueful , highly personal recollections of the deal , among them a feeling that " we were so close to solving our problems . " Still , he says , there is lesson No. 1 : " Never issue reset notes . " As this suggests , RJR had notes that reeked : $7 billion of pay-in-kind securities . Issued in 1989 , these notes came with the promise that by April 1991 , RJR would , if necessary , " reset " their interest rate at a level that would give the notes a fighting chance to sell at par . But by early 1991 the junk-bond market had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downgraded , and its notes were selling at 70 . There was no way a reset could lift them to par . Kravis says one visitor to his office declared bankruptcy inevitable . Kravis said no way . But KKR was forced to put more money ( $1.7 billion in that swatch ) into RJR to save it . Lesson No. 2 , says Kravis , is " Do n't rely too heavily on past outcomes . " KKR always planned to split RJR 's food division , Nabisco , from its lawsuit-embattled tobacco business . But for tax reasons , RJR had to wait five years to do so . Unfortunately , says Kravis , " in about four years and nine months " there began to be signs that tobacco plaintiffs were gaming ascendancy . KKR 's lawyers therefore warned Kravis and Roberts that splitting off the food division might be construed as " fraudulent conveyance " - i.e. , wrongful disposal of an asset that might otherwise be used to satisfy the plaintiffs ' claims . Worse yet , the two men , as controlling principals of KKR , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't split off the food division but instead made a faux exit by trading half of its RJR shares for a piece of Borden . And that company , says Kravis , looking quite pained by this time at this dolorous recital , " turned out to be much weaker than we thought . " By the early 1990s , of course , the RJR saga had been made notorious in Barbarians at the Gate , both the book ( co-written by John Helyar , now of FORTUNE ) and the movie . ( Snap quiz , difficult variety : What actors played Kravis and Roberts ? ) For Kravis , who cares about being liked-Roberts seemingly can take it or leave it-the firm 's unending public relations problems were excruciating . He recalls a friend 's calling him on behalf of a client wanting to know who handled KKR 's PR . Responding that it was Kekst &; Co. , Kravis asked , " Why does your client want to know ? Does he want to make sure he never uses them ? " The caller laughingly said that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KKR was faring publicly . Said Kravis : " You 've got to be kidding . We 're getting killed . I chop my head off every day . " ( Follow-up : Kekst &; Co. is still KKR 's PR consultant . In the movie , Jonathan Pryce played Kravis and Peter Dvorsky played Roberts . ) One of KKR 's buyout competitors , John Canning of Madison Dearborn , says that the blistering experience of RJR " could have ruined a lot of firms , " and that KKR 's picking itself up and marching on was testimony to its strength . The firm did in fact make another mark for itself in the mid-1990s , by successfully raising a then-record amount of money , $6 billion , for what came to be called its 1996 fund . But the terms of that fund indicated that KKR 's status in the buyout world was weakening : A growing cadre of tough , hungry competitors , working to get in the game , had by then made the sharing of losses and fees commonplace and had for-sworn-echoes of RJR ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single company . So KKR 's limited partners and one prospective investor , Calpers , put the arm on the firm to match the competition . The argument got so heated that Roberts told Calpers to take a walk , saying it would n't be welcome in the fund ( though years later the two made up ) . Eventually , KKR capitulated . The firm agreed to lower its management fee ( from 1.5% to 1.1% ) , split its monitoring and transaction fees with the investors , and switch to a loss-sharing system . So suddenly KKR was n't getting the tribute that it had become accustomed to as king . The 1996 fund has since grown into what buyout firms call the " harvesting " phase , and is therefore ripe to be judged . In the way that counts most , it has done fine . As of September , the fund was showing a net IRR of 13.4% ; by March , according to one limited partner , that had climbed to 14.3% . In a period that included the bubble and in which general expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund has had some home runs , particularly British insurance broker Willis Group . KKR took Willis private in 1998 in a $1.7 billion management buy-out . In 2000 , KKR made a key move by hiring Joe Plumeri , a former Citigroup executive , as CEO . Willis then went public in 2001 , and it recently had a market value of $5.6 billion . The weakness of the 1996 fund is that it 's had a terrible batting average , like Jason Giambi off steroids . Of the 34 companies KKR put money into , 15 became losers . Some of the flops were telecom companies that KKR , though it likes to think itself a value investor , got sucked into during the bubble hysteria . A hoary struggler is Primedia , which owns about 120 special-interest magazines ( Motor Trend , for example ) . The company has had problems , to put it mildly ; says Roberts dryly , " Where can I start ? " Beginning in 1989 , three different KKR funds have pumped $1.2 billion into Primedia ( originally called K-III ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year Primedia unloaded New York magazine for $55 million . Recently it sold About.com-a subsidiary whose value had been written down to almost zero-to the New York Times Co. for $410 million . Primedia 's stock , which three years ago hit 85 cents , is now around $3.75 , and KKR figures itself about $20 million in the hole on the deal . For Kravis and Roberts , the most galling losses in the 1996 fund seem to be two that mocked their good record in consumer companies . One was the infamous Regal Cinemas buy , which KKR and Hicks Muse carried out in 1997 , at a time when the buyout industry was mad for movie theater companies . But everybody then got wildly aggressive about building new screens , to the point of generally ruining the business . At Regal , says Roberts , management not only overbuilt but also " played one owner against another . " Final result : bankruptcy and a wipeout of the two firms ' $1 billion in equity . The other disaster was sporting-goods company Spalding , an investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Spalding story , a rival sporting-goods manufacturer recently said , " KKR ruined it . " Kravis seems implicitly to agree . " We thought management was okay , " says Kravis , " and we took our eyes off the company . " KKR eventually lost more than 90% of its $674 million investment . RENOVATION Sometimes it takes pain to get progress . As the 1990s were ending , Kravis and Roberts shared many long phone calls , and decided their firm must be shaped up . Over the years since , they 've made five organizational changes , all aimed at differentiating the firm from what Kravis calls an industry that 's become " commoditized . " But the result of those changes is to make KKR a little less dependent on the swagger and guts of its two principals . The shakeup started with the two bosses giving up their practice of making all the investment decisions by themselves . Instead they now are members of an investment committee that includes a handful of their senior partners as well . The committee convenes every Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority . Next to be organized was a portfolio committee , which gathers quarterly to closely examine the performance , well-being , and possible salability of all of the companies in KKR 's portfolio ( 27 at the moment ) . Kravis and Roberts and partner Perry Golkin are on the committee , but it also includes a string of senior advisors that KKR has hired for their operating expertise . Among the advisors are some former corporate CEOs , such as Ed Artzt of Procter &; Gamble and George Fisher of Motorola . A relatively new advisor is retired four-star general John " Jack " Keane , who as vice chief of staff ran the Army 's operations . Sizing up KKR recently , he marveled at the " depth of knowledge " that the firm 's people seem to have accumulated about every business that KKR is in . One probable reason for that is another change at KKR : the establishment of 11 industry groups-for example , chemicals and health care . A partner , a managing director , an associate , and an analyst staff each group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about out-of-favor industries that might yield bargain-priced opportunities . Kravis has told KKR 's folk that they are not to learn their industry from talking to CEOs . Rather they are to walk the aisles of trade shows , and by all means get to purchasing agents , who , says Kravis , " will talk your head off telling you who delivers and who has the best product . " The industry experts give KKR a leg up on another change : 100-day plans , to be put into effect immediately upon the firm 's gaming control of a company ( and to be followed by other 100-day plans ) . For example , a plan might include the institution of new metrics . Preparing to take over Canada 's Yellow Pages Group in 2002 , KKR discovered many of its salespeople were making about two sales calls a day . New standards , requiring more calls a day , went into effect immediately . Yellow Pages became a resounding success , resulting in a quick flip and a record 146% IRR for KKR . The other change for KKR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago an executive named Steve Burd had run such a thing for KKR . But he was pulled off temporarily to be CEO of Safeway , a job he 's so far held more than 12 years , and in-house consulting died . Now it 's in the hands of Dean Nelson , 46 , formerly at Boston Consulting Group . And guess what ? He 's been pulled off to help out at Primedia . But he has also been busy at Sealy , which KKR bought last year from Bain Capital ( a deal exemplifying today 's highly popular practice of one buyout firm selling to another ) . And 18 partners and associates of the consulting operation , called Capstone , are working around the U.S. and in Europe . As for Capstone 's pay , it comes from both KKR ( which may , for example , want Capstone to do due diligence on an acquisition it 's considering ) and the companies that KKR controls . It is too early to tell how much all of KKR 's shaping-up exercises will do for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to make investments in 2000 , looked decent through last September , showing a net IRR of 14.7% . KKR , in fact , believes it has made a wonderfully successful entry into Europe , beginning with deals ( such as Willis ) made before the firm actually opened an office there , in 1999 . That operation , in London , was first run by Edward " Ned " Gilhuly , 45 , who moved from KKR 's Menlo Park office to get Europe off the ground . Today it is run by Johannes Huth , 45 , a German national who used to work for Investcorp . Gilhuly and two other partners , Michael Michelson , 54 , and Scott Stuart , 45 , are logical candidates to succeed Kravis and Roberts one day . They were , notably , the three men who joined Kravis and Roberts on the investment committee when it was formed . And Stuart has led KKR 's formation of a new offshoot , KKR Financial-the first extension of the brand . There would as well be an odd symmetry to Gilhuly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Stanford Business School , are the same age , and do the two-coast routine , Gilhuly working in California , Stuart in New York . But " eventually " is the operative word , because there 's no sign of a spot opening up at the top anytime soon . In fact , the terms of the European fund now being raised provide that investors can pull out money if either of the cousins stops giving KKR the major part of his time . Not to worry . Roberts guffaws at the very idea of retirement . In March , Kravis got so wound up discussing his business that he stopped to half-apologize to his visitor . " You may be asking yourself why I 'm so fired up , " he said . " I love change . I love challenges . When we can go in and fix a business , I really love it . " You have to believe him , because why else would this 61-year-old multibillionaire recently have taken a three-week business swing around Asia ? It was n't easy , not even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in China , he said , was very tiring . But he wanted to do three things there : The first was to investigate how KKR ( whose companies already have 35 plants in China ) might " source " its own operations better . The second was to meet with Chinese companies that might want to invest in the West ( by , say , partnering with KKR on deals ) . The third was to consider Chinese investment opportunities . And he found , he said with satisfaction , that Chinese businesspeople know the KKR name well . One executive told Kravis that for training he had his people watch Barbarians at the Gate . Whoa , said Kravis , maybe that 's not a great idea . Oh , yes , said the executive , " I want them to take risks . I want them to understand the sky 's the limit . " That was a thought Kravis could n't exactly argue with , so he did n't .
