Grace Eversleigh had been the companion to the dowager Duchess of Wyndham for five years , and in that time she had learned several things about her employer , the most pertinent of which was this : <p> Under her grace 's stern , exacting , and haughty exterior did not beat a heart of gold . <p> Which was not to say that the offending organ was black . Her grace the dowager Duchess of Wyndham could never be called completely evil . Nor was she cruel , spiteful , or even entirely mean-spirited . But Augusta Elizabeth Candida Debenham Cavendish had been born the daughter of a duke , she had married a duke , and then given birth to another . Her sister was now a member of a minor royal family in some central European country whose name Grace could never quite pronounce , and her brother owned most of East Anglia . As far as the dowager was concerned , the world was a stratified place , with a hierarchy as clear as it was rigid . <p> Wyndhams , and especially Wyndhams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . <p> And as such , the dowager expected certain behavior and deference to be paid . She was rarely kind , she did not tolerate stupidity , and her compliments were never falsely given . ( Some might say they were never given at all , but Grace had , precisely twice , borne witness to a curt but honest " well done "  --  not that anyone believed her when she mentioned it later . ) <p> But the dowager had saved Grace from an impossible situation , and for that she would always possess Grace 's gratitude , respect , and most of all , her loyalty . Still , there was no getting around the fact that the dowager was something less than cheerful , and so , as they rode home from the Lincolnshire Dance and Assembly , their elegant and well-sprung coach gliding effortlessly across the midnight-dark roads , Grace could not help but be relieved that her employer was fast asleep . <p> It had been a lovely night , truly , and Grace knew she should not be so uncharitable . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor with her cronies , and Grace had not been required to attend to her . Instead , she had danced and laughed with all of her old friends , she had drunk three glasses of punch , she had poked fun at Thomas  --  always an entertaining endeavor ; he was the current duke and certainly needed a bit less obsequiousness in his life . But most of all she had smiled . She had smiled so well and so often that her cheeks hurt . <p> The pure and unexpected joy of the evening had left her body humming with energy , and she was now perfectly happy to grin into the darkness , listening to the soft snore of the dowager as they made their way home . <p> Grace closed her eyes , even though she did not think herself sleepy . There was something hypnotic about the motion of the carriage . She was riding backwards  --  she always did  --  and the rhythmic clip-clop of the horses ' hooves was making her drowsy . It was strange . Her eyes were tired , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nap would not be such a misplaced endeavor  --  as soon as they returned to Belgrave , she would be required to aid the dowager with  --  <p> Crack ! <p> Grace sat up straight , glancing over at her employer , who , miraculously , had not awakened . What was that sound ? Had someone  --  <p> Crack ! <p> This time the carriage lurched , coming to a halt so swiftly that the dowager , who was facing front as usual , was jerked off her seat . <p> Grace immediately dropped to her knees next to her employer , her arms instinctively coming around her . <p> " What the devil ? " the dowager snapped , but fell silent when she caught Grace 's expression . <p> " Gunshots , " Grace whispered . <p> The dowager 's lips pursed tightly , and then she yanked off her emerald necklace and thrust it at Grace . " Hide this , " she ordered . <p> " Me ? " Grace practically squeaked , but she shoved the jewels under a cushion all the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to smack a little sense into the esteemed Augusta Wyndham , because if she were killed because the dowager was too cheap to hand over her jewels  --  <p> The door was wrenched open . <p> " Stand and deliver ! " <p> Grace froze , still crouched on the floor next to the dowager . Slowly , she lifted her head to the doorway , but all she could see was the silvery end of a gun , round and menacing , and pointed at her forehead . <p> " Ladies , " came the voice again , and this time it was a bit different , almost polite . The speaker then stepped forward out of the shadows , and with a graceful motion swept his arm in an arc to usher them out . " The pleasure of your company , if you will , " he murmured . <p> Grace felt her eyes dart back and forth  --  an exercise in futility , to be sure , as there was clearly no avenue of escape . She turned to the dowager , expecting to find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was then that Grace realized she was shaking . <p> The dowager was shaking . <p> Both of them were . <p> The highwayman leaned in , one shoulder resting against the door frame . He smiled then  --  slow and lazy , and with the charm of a rogue . How Grace could see all of that when half of his face was covered with his mask , she did not know , but three things about him were abundantly clear : <p> He was young . <p> He was strong . <p> And he was dangerously lethal . <p> " Ma'am , " Grace said , giving the dowager a nudge . " I think we should do as he says . " <p> " I do love a sensible woman , " he said , and smiled again . Just a quirk this time  --  one devastating little lift at the corner of his mouth . But his gun remained high , and his charm did little to assuage Grace 's fear . <p> And then he extended his other arm . He extended his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if he were a country gentleman , about to inquire about the weather . <p> <br> Continues ...
