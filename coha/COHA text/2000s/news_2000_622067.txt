<p> Michael Alexander is somebody I looked up to when I was growing up . A smooth-dressing young man , he was a star athlete in high school who had the gift of gab and a style that was unique . <p> He was five years my senior , but we often hung out together , shooting hoops and talking . He went out of state to play college basketball , but eventually made his way back home to the old neighborhood . <p> One of the things I admired most about him was the way he took care of his son , Mike Jr . Michael had broken up with his son 's mother , but he made up his mind early on to stay involved with and accessible to Mike Jr . <p> " When I was growing up , my father was n't around , and I wanted to be a better father than my father was , " Michael said . " I wanted to make sure my son had the right kind of guidance . " <p> They could be seen together just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football games , at professional basketball games , at barber shops . <p> In embracing his role as a father , Michael set an example not just for Mike Jr. , but also for me , when , at 18 , I reluctantly became a father myself . <p> At first I was angry and resentful about being a father before I was out of my teens . Yes , I had been irresponsible and careless , but I was in my first year of college , I had my life ahead of me , and I had no intention of settling down with the woman who became the mother of my twins . <p> Although I never completely turned my back on my children , for a few years I was a less-than-adequate parent . But gradually , Michael 's example got to me . Hanging out with him and Mike Jr. , who was never far from his father 's side , had a good influence . I began to think about all the benefits I 'd reaped from the stability provided by my own parents , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the neighborhood full of kids being raised without fathers , I thought about all the trouble I could have gotten into but did n't because I knew how heavily my dad would have weighed in if I had . <p> Gradually , my anger began to fade . I realized that nothing was going to change the fact that I had been irresponsible . Like it or not , my children were going to be a part of my life . More importantly , I realized that I was going to have to be a part of theirs . <p> My children spend about half their time with me . When they are n't with me , they know I 'm just a phone call away . On the days I 'm not with them , I give them rides to school in the morning or pick them up in the afternoon . Like Michael , I take them places : to rap concerts , political rallies and picnics . I shuttle them to and from football and cheerleading practice and help them with their homework . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get tutoring . I make sure that I earn enough money to ensure that their material needs are met . If one of them forgets to bring their lunch to school , they call me . <p> I 'm in good company : Although single women are the primary caregivers in 8 million U.S. households today , more than 2.1 million homes with children are headed by single men . <p> Unfortunately , there are also plenty of fathers who do n't take care of their children or who choose not to be a presence in their children 's lives . <p> There are various reasons for this , ranging from irresponsibility to hostile reactions from the mothers of their children to lack of money  --  a factor that weighs heavily in a culture where how much one makes is seen as a measure of manhood . <p> Still , these invisible men  --  and the effect their absence has on their children 's lives  --  has led to a social catastrophe in America . <p> According to the National Center of Health Statistics , children who grow up without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional problems and twice as likely to repeat a grade in school . According to Census Bureau statistics , many of our high school dropouts , youths in jail and teenage mothers have one thing in common : a missing father . <p> " Sixty-three percent of youth suicides are from fatherless homes . Ninety percent of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes ; 85 percent of children that exhibit behavior disorders come from fatherless homes , " says Tom Hoerner , author of " Bachelor Parents and Their Functional Families . " <p> In the face of such dire statistics , you would think there would be national weekly summits to address the issues of fatherless homes and absentee parents . But this is not the case . Fathers , and especially single fathers , face outward hostility from family courts , pandering politicians and women 's advocacy groups that treat men with disdain . <p> All one has to do is look at the trials Juan Miguel Gonzalez has undergone in order to get his son , Elian , back . Despite the dysfunctional relations between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine efforts to keep Elian here would have been nearly as effective had Juan Gonzalez , rather than his ex-wife , died on a boat coming to America . Our culture has internalized the idea that children belong with their mother . A father 's presence may be considered desirable , but it 's also considered expendable . <p> The hostility fathers face was amply evident last year , when the House of Representatives passed the " Fathers Count Act . " The bill , sponsored by Congresswoman Nancy Johnson , R-Conn. , would give more than $155 million to nonprofit groups that promote " fatherhood initiatives " for noncustodial fathers . These could range from promoting marriage , to parental counseling , to money management and job referral services . The bill would also allow states to suspend child-support payments to unemployed and underemployed men in arrears while they receive job training or upgrade job skills . <p> This seems like a positive step toward getting irresponsible men involved with their children , but the National Organization for Woman called the bill " inappropriate governmental policy " that would help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject the twisted logic that the best way to take care of poor children is to fund programs for fathers who do not have day-to-day responsibility for raising their kids and that the cure for poverty is marriage , " wrote NOW President Patricia Ireland . <p> The " Fathers Count " bill is currently in the Senate , and hopefully it will pass . But attitudes like NOW 's are similar to those fostered by governmental agencies , which tend to treat fathers like walking ATM machines , focusing on enforcing child support payments rather than on strengthening parental rights such as visitation agreements , which are often circumvented by angry mothers . <p> According to the Census Bureau study " Child Support for Custodial Mothers and Father , " 79 percent of men who have visitation rights or joint custody of their children pay child support . Money is important in rearing children , but involvement is equally important  --  if not more so . <p> Of course , some men are abusive , irresponsible and should n't be involved in their children 's lives . But there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the right guidance , mentoring and help . I am a prime example of this . <p> As a young father , I am growing with my children . At times it has been rough , and I have asked for and received a lot of help  --  for baby sitting , money and tips on parenting  --  from my parents , family and friends . But thanks to the example set by my own father and by people like Michael Alexander , I know what 's possible . I know what a good father looks like , and I strive every day to live up to that image . <p> Fatherhood should be one of the main issues on this nation 's social agenda . As a society , we should make sure that men face fewer roadblocks . This will lead to stronger families , a stronger community and a stronger country . <p> HAVE YOUR SAY <p>  --  To reach us : Respond to THIS WEEK 'S TOPIC at sunday@sfgate.com , or join the discussion at sfgate.com/vent/sunday .
