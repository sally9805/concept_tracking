THE FIRST TIME I SEEN HER , I got a bad feeling inside . Not like I was in danger or nothing . Just like she was somebody I should stay clear of . To tell the truth , she was a freak like me . The kind of person folks ca n't help but tease . That 's bad if you 're a kid like me . It 's worse for a new teacher like her . Miss Saunders is as different as they come . First off , she got a man 's name , Michael . Now who ever heard of a woman named that ? She 's tall and fat like nobody 's business , and she 's got the smallest feet I ever seen . Worse yet , she 's got a giant white stain spread halfway across her face like somebody tossed acid on it or something . I try not to stare the first day that amazon woman-teacher heads my way . See , I got a way of attracting strange characters . They draw to me like someone stuck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I spend a lot of time trying to fit in here at McClenton Middle School . I ai n't letting nobody ruin it for me , especially no teacher . I did n't even look up when Miss Saunders came up to me that day like I 'm some kind of information center . " Excuse me , " she says . She 's wearing a dark purple suit , and a starched white shirt with matching purple buttons . That outfit costs three hundred dollars , easy . " I 'm trying to find the principal 's office . I know it 's around here somewhere . Can you help me ? " Before I catch myself , my eyes ricochet like pin balls , bounding from John-John McIntrye 's beady brown eyes right up to hers . I swallow hard . Stare at her till John-John whacksme on the arm with his rolled-up comic book . " That-a-way , " I say , pointing up the hall . " Thank you . Now what 's your name ? " she says , putting down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maleeka . Maleeka Madisonthe third , " I say , smacking my gum real loud . " Do n't let that fancy name fool you , " John-John butts in . " She ai n't nobody worth knowing . " Miss Saunders stares down at him till he turns his head away and starts playing with the buttons on his shirt like some two-year-old . " Like I say , the office is that-a-way . " I point . " Thank you , " she says , walking off . Then she stops stone still , like some bright idea has just come to her , turns around , and heads back my way . My skin starts to crawl before she even opens her mouth . " Maleeka , your skin is pretty . Like a blue-black sky after it 's rained and rained , " she says . Then she smiles and explains how that line comes from a favorite poem of hers . Next thing I know , she 's heading down the hall again like nothing much happened . When she 's far enough away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pretty , just a whole lotta black . " Before I can punch him good , he 's singing a rap song . " Maleeka , Maleekababoom , boom , boom , we sure wan na keep her , baboom , boom , boom , but she so black , baboom , boom , boom , we just ca n't see her . " Before I know it , three more boys is pointing at me and singing that song , too . Me , I 'm wishing the building will collapse on top of me . John-John McIntyre is the smallest seventh grader in the world . Even fifth graders can see over his head . Sometimes I have a hard time believing he and me are both thirteen . He 's my color , but since second grade he 's been teasing me about being too black . Last year , when I thought things could n't get no worse , he came up with this here song . Now , here this woman comes talking that black stuff . Stirring him up again . Seems like people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't about my color , it 's my clothes . Momma makes them by hand . They look it , toolopsided pockets , stitching forever unraveling . I never know when a collar 's gon na fall off , or a pushpin gon na stick me and make me holler out in class . I stopped worrying about that this year now that Charlese lends me clothes to wear . I stash them in the locker and change into them before first period . I 'm like Superman when I get Charlese 's clothes on . I got a new attitude , and my teachers sure do n't like it none . It 's bad enough that I 'm the darkest , worse-dressed thing in school . I 'm also the tallest , skinniest thing you ever seen . And people like John-John remind me of it every chance they get . They do n't say nothing about the fact that I 'm a math whiz , and can outdo ninth graders when it comes to figuring numbers . Or that I got a good memory and never forget one single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see , and they do n't seem to like what they see much . Up till now , I just took it . The name calling . The pushing and shoving and cheating off me . Then last week something happened . I was walking down the hall in one of Char 's dresses , strutting my stuff , looking good . Then Char walked up to me and told me to take off her clothes . There was maybe eight or nine kids around when she said it , too , including Caleb . I thought she was kidding . She was n't . So I went to the girls ' room and put my own stuff back on . That 's when I made up my mind . Enough is enough . I deserve better than for people to treat me any old way they want . But saying that is one thing , making it happen is something else . So you see , I got my own troubles . I do n't need no scar-faced teacher making things worse . But I got this feeling Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad .
