Each time I do this event , I think , ' If I do this really well , Nicky will come back , ' " said Steel . " I 'm a very private person . But not when it comes to mental health . I chose not to keep Nicky 's illness a secret and , hopefully , my speaking out might help another family struggling with this disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local mental health programs and facilities . Steel is heartened by a trend within the medical community of recognizing and treating mental illness in young children . <p> " They did n't do that when Nicky was little , " said Steel , who wrote a book about her son 's struggle , " His Bright Light . " " I hope the foundation makes a difference . One thing that thrills me is the book has sold close to a million copies . When I think of all the lives Nicky has touched , it 's amazing .

" We founded the company 11 years ago . I just knew from the start it would work . " <p> Believe it or not , there are those who fear 6-foot-tall , size-2 models with triple-D cups . But satin ruffles and marabou trim aside , AP strives to be the everywoman ( and everyman , for that matter ) lingerie store . The boutique , tricked out in AP 's signature pink-and-black decor with a racy " rock ' n ' roll boudoir " design , stocks products in 24 sizes , running the cup-size gamut from A to F. <p> " AP is the most fashionable lingerie company in the world , " declared Corre .
