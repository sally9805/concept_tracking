And I understood , in the endless instant <p> before she answered , how Pharaoh 's army , seeing <p> the ground break open , seeing the first fringed <p> horses fall into the gap , made their vows , <p> that each heart changes , faced with a single awe <p> and in that moment a promise is written out . <p> - BRENDA HILLMAN , " Mighty Forms " <p> WHILE DANA MACARTHUR 's HUSBAND Bryan was busy unwrapping gifts with his tellers , she slipped away-finally-from the Sentinel Savings holiday party to smoke her only cigarette of the night . <p> Smoking was allowed inside the banquet hall-the upper reaches near the ceiling had been foggy for hours-but Dana was trying to keep her backsliding hidden . She 'd quit last New Year 's , more or less , as a promise to Bryan . Honey , he 'd say , I just do n't want anything to happen to you , and how could she disagree ? But she missed her cigarettes , missed the private time they 'd always given her . All night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Bryan fuss happily over them , and felt , more and more , as though she was standing alone in the room . Why not go the distance ? <p> She almost escaped the banquet hall unnoticed . But at the doorway to the lobby , turning the corner too fast , she nearly walked into the chest of a man she knew : Jimmy , a new teller at Bryan 's bank , just out of college , tall and trim and smelling faintly of beer . <p> " Excuse me , " Jimmy said . He bowed a little , swept his hand forward in mock gallantry . " Milady . " <p> Dana sidestepped him with only a murmur of acknowledgment . She had met Jimmy just once before tonight , while stopping by the bank for a lunch date with Bryan a few weeks earlier . She 'd noticed Jimmy right away-you could n't help but notice him . He was handsome in a catalog-model way : sandy blond , with a symmetrical face and slim hips , and a half smile she bet he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook hands across the counter . She decided then not to pay him much mind . Most bankers , she 'd found , were a lot less slick than they hoped . <p> But earlier tonight , while Bryan and the other branch managers handed out bonus checks , Dana had caught Jimmy staring at her from the other side of the room , his arm slung across the shoulders of a short , pretty blond . He 'd grinned at Dana , rocked on his feet ; the blond stared wide-eyed at the party over the rim of her plastic cup . The quickness of his smile disturbed her ; Dana had looked away . Bryan had reintroduced them not long after : You remember Jimmy ? Yes , of course . . . . His handshake , firm and dry . April , his wife or girlfriend-Dana could n't remember . <p> In a shadowed nook just outside the entrance to the hall , Dana lit up , feeling small and furtive . Snow swirled past her , sparse and gritty . The parking lot shone with a glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in her heels . There 'd be some bruised asses later when the party let out . Dana watched headlights crawl east on Henderson . The roads would be getting bad , too . <p> She thought about Jimmy 's wink , his smile . She tried to make herself angry , but the feeling would n't take . Dana was twenty-seven-hardly old-but in the past couple of years , it was true , people like Jimmy and April had come to seem younger and younger , more like the high-schoolers in Dana 's algebra classes than the kind of people she and Bryan were . Which was like no one , except in the way they acted . Everyone in the banquet hall was either too young , drinking too much , or middle-aged , trying to seem young by drinking too much . Jimmy might be nothing more than a boy in a grown-up 's body , but at least he did n't pretend to be someone he was n't . <p> And anyway , whatever else in him might be flawed , Dana could certainly appreciate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to her left wheezed , and Jimmy himself appeared , leaning his torso outside , craning his neck left and right . Dana froze ; her nook was just out of his line of sight . But Jimmy walked outside , shrugging on an overcoat . He turned a half circle and then spotted her . He grinned , feigning surprise . <p> " Dana , hey , " he said . He pointed at her hand . " You look like someone sneaking . I 'm dying . Can I bum one ? " <p> She should have told him she was finished , which was the truth . But instead she said , " Who says I 'm sneaking ? " and extended her pack . <p> Jimmy laughed and took a cigarette . " Well , " he said , " Bryan 's been telling us all how you quit . He 's real proud of you . " <p> Dana was n't surprised to hear it , but the news did n't make her any happier . <p> " Our secret , all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and patted his coat pockets . " Hey , I 'm not legal either . April 'd have a damn kitten . " <p> Dana held out her lighter , but Jimmy said , " Got one . " He probably had his own cigarettes , too . He lit up , took a drag , and sighed . Then he leaned companionably back against the brick . <p> " You know , " he said , " I 'm glad to see you here tonight . " <p> He glanced at her sideways and blew out a plume of smoke , half smiling . <p> What a piece of work . " Is that so ? " she asked . <p> He laughed . " Yeah , it is . And not just because that 's a killer dress there . " <p> Dana could scarcely believe she 'd heard him . Jimmy had gone right for her vanity , newly bruised . She had found the dress a few days earlier , shopping on a whim , and saw with a little thrill how good she looked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an ankle-length skirt slit up to midthigh . Probably not appropriate for a Christmas party , but its lines and color favored her , showed her off . She 'd been dieting , had flattened her stomach a little ; in the dress all that work seemed worth it . To teach she only ever wore sensible clothes ; just once or twice a year did she have a chance to look this good . <p> So why was she surprised that someone had noticed ? <p> And ... had n't she wanted other men to notice ? In the few days she owned it , if she was being honest , she had imagined strangers seeing her in it . Admiring her . Even removing it from her . The good-looking man buying ties in the next department : she 'd seen him in the mirror , caught in the act of looking away as she held the dress up against her body . Or even-she had indeed thought this-a man like Jimmy . Maybe even Jimmy himself . A man who winked at the boss 's wife when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What would a man like that think of her in a dress like this1 . <p> Now she knew . She kept her eyes out on the parking lot . <p> " Thank you , " she said , keeping her voice neutral . " Where 's your girlfriend ? " <p> Jimmy grinned as though Dana had done something wonderful . " Inside , " he said . " Ladies ' room . There was a line . I saw my window and took it . " <p> Dana crushed out the butt of her cigarette . Instead of waiting out an office Christmas party she should be standing outside some fifth-year senior 's house , listening to the blare of speakers propped in a window , trying to keep track of her center of gravity . Jimmy could ask : What 's your major ? She could tell him to fuck off . Or she could lean on his arm . <p> " Your husband 's quite a guy , " Jimmy said to her . <p> " Thank you , " Dana said-inanely , as though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's crazy about you . Dana , Dana ... that 's all he talks about . " <p> Jimmy gave her that sideways glance again . It was uncanny : was she wearing a sign with her troubles on it ? Did men like Jimmy have a radar for insecurities ? <p> She 'd tried to surprise Bryan with the new dress tonight . My my my , he 'd said when she came out of the bathroom wearing it . A flicker in his eyes , a dimple in his cheek-and she 'd felt grateful , taller , stronger . Like the old days , that was all it took . He was knotting his tie . She wanted him to drop it , to come over to her . To feel him pull her closer when he kissed her . But instead he said , You look fabulous , hon , and then went back to frowning at his crooked knot . <p> And she 'd seen the evening rolling out ahead of them : after the long tedium of the party she and Bryan would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home safely . They would n't be alone again in their bedroom until at least three in the morning , and by then they would stink of sweat and stale smoke , and Bryan might very well be asleep , turned to the wall , before the dress was even off . <p> She should , she knew , go inside . End this line of thinking before it extended any further . <p> Instead she shook another cigarette from the pack . She started to dig for her lighter , but Jimmy held out his . Dana leaned forward toward his cupped hands . His arm pressed against hers through the sleeves of their coats . He was wearing cologne : just a hint escaped from the collar of his shirt . <p> Jimmy was saying : " No , I mean it . I love working for Bryan , we all do . Heck of a nice guy . " <p> " He sure is . " <p> " Can I ask you something , though ? " His eyes were glittering with secrets . <p> Dana took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sure , " she said . <p> " So I 've been hearing this rumor . " <p> She knew , then , what he was going to ask , and felt a surge of disappointment so strong she almost began to cry . <p> She said , " Go ahead . " <p> " Is it true that-I mean , I heard that- " Jimmy laughed at himself . " Is it true he saved someone 's life once ? That 's why ... ? " Jimmy moved his fingers up and down over his right forearm , indicating Bryan 's scars . <p> Dana wondered what sort of look was on her face . <p> " Hey , " Jimmy said , " I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to offend you . Really . " <p> But she had no one but herself to blame for his asking . When Dana had been just .. . just a kid , five years ago , she had stood in a corner at a Sentinel dinner party and told the story of Bryan 's burns-his heroism-for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wanted the people who worked with him to know what Bryan had done , what he was . And it was possible that the reason Bryan Macarthur was now a branch manager had something to do with that story , circulating out there in whispers . Dana and Bryan had never discussed this possibility , but she knew they had both thought it . He 'd been upset-sad-when he found out she 'd told . <p> He 'd said : They look at me differently . I 'm nothing special . <p> She 'd told him : You are to me . Then she kissed him , deeply . <p> Now she took a deep breath . " It 's true , " she told Jimmy . " We were in college together , in Colorado . We went to the mountains on a ski trip . We were driving through a blizzard and found a wrecked car . Bryan pulled a woman out after the car caught fire . " <p> Dana pushed back her coat and dress sleeve . She held up her wrist in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up to the road , " she said . " I got burned a little , too . " <p> Jimmy looked at the scar twisting from her forearm down to the base of her thumb . " Jesus , " he said , leaning back . " That 's pretty fucking brave . " <p> " It happened quickly , " Dana said . <p> " That 's a strange thing to say . " <p> She shrugged . He was right . She could n't explain why she 'd said it ... or why she 'd shown him the scar , which she usually kept hidden . It was nothing , not compared with Bryan 's . Her face flushed , and she hoped Jimmy would n't notice . She was lingering too long-what did she think was going to happen , anyway ? What could happen ? She had to end this , get back inside . <p> When she looked up from readjusting her sleeve , Jimmy was leaning forward , too close . <p> " You 've got some secrets , I bet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dana pulled back , almost by instinct . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I have to get back inside . Good night , Jimmy . " <p> She took a step , her stomach jumping , but Jimmy said , " Wait , " and even though she told herself to keep going , she turned around . <p> Jimmy took hold of her hand . He was taller even than Bryan , and she had to arch up to kiss him . His lips were cold , his breath tasting of cigarette smoke and the sting of a breath mint . He opened her mouth up wide ; she returned the pressure . His hand slipped down the back of her long coat and squeezed at her rear end , and for a moment she was pressed up against him from her knees to her shoulders . <p> Then Dana put a hand inside Jimmy 's open overcoat-his stomach , under the smooth silk of his shirt , was stony hard-and pushed . Jimmy rocked back . He smiled and brushed a thumb wonderingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dana asked , and though she meant to sound angry , her voice quavered . <p> " You wanted me to , " he said . <p> He was right . And she wanted him to kiss her again . She wanted , in fact , to pull him into an empty car and do a lot more than kiss him . Since meeting Bryan she 'd never kissed another man . Her body felt light , her ankles wobbly . <p> But she said : " I 'm going inside . Do n't ever do that again . " <p> " You might change your mind , " Jimmy said . He dug in his pocket and handed her a business card . She took it the same way she 'd kissed him , her body acting a second ahead of her will . " Do n't call me at home , " he said . " My cell 's there on the card . " <p> " I 'm not going to call you , " she said , and dropped the card into the snow . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , and then shrugged . " That 's too bad , " he said , and then put his hands in his coat pockets and walked past her . " You 're a very sexy woman , Dana . " <p> " Bryan could fire you for this . " She hated the shrillness of her voice . <p> Jimmy walked backwards for a few steps . " Well , I guess if I have a job Monday morning , I 'll know you did n't tell him . " <p> The pneumatic door wheezed open and Jimmy walked inside ; the party-voices and laughter and warmth-spilled out . The door closed on the noise , on Jimmy , and she was alone again . <p> Dana leaned against the brick for a few minutes , in shock . <p> She did n't want to return to the party , but she had to . Bryan would worry if she was out of sight any longer ; even now he might be looking for her . But she fumbled her cigarettes as she transferred them from her pocket to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost did n't pick them up ; they 'd gotten her into this trouble , after all . But she knelt all the same . The cigarettes lay on an old crust of snow , next to Jimmy 's business card . She crumpled the card up and dropped it into her purse ; she 'd throw that away inside , in the rest room . <p> The lobby was empty , except for a young couple Dana did n't know who spoke loudly and fondly at each other . Dana walked past them , down a side hall and into the ladies ' room . There was , of course , no line . <p> She splashed water into her mouth and chewed a handful of breath mints ; she reapplied her lipstick . In the mirror , under the fluorescents , she looked too pale . Exactly like a woman who 'd just done something she was n't proud of . <p> Bryan spotted her the moment she reentered the hall ; he broke away from a knot of laughing employees to jog over . He was wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his movements . On Bryan , gangly and tall , it looked even more ridiculous than it was supposed to . His expression was at once eager and sheepish . <p> " What is that ? " she asked . <p> " I know , I know . The tellers got it for me . And a nice pen , too . " He kissed the top of her head . " You 're cold , " he said , drawing back . <p> " I was getting some air . " <p> His lips tightened . " Uh-uh . You were smoking . I can smell it . " <p> She tried to play it off like a joke : " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " <p> " Honey , you were doing so well- " <p> That was it ; she wanted to slug him . " Bryan . I do n't want to hear it . " <p> He looked at her , his face falling a bit . " Come on , " he said , his voice low . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he do if she started a scene here ? The party was his baby , one of his great achievements at Sentinel : There 's too much separation around here . We need to be closer if we 're going to get the right kind of work done . <p> But why was her anger Bryan 's fault , why was anything Bryan 's fault ? She was the one who 'd just been groped by one of his employees . <p> Before she could reply , Bryan looked over her shoulder and brightened . Dana turned and saw , to her horror , Jimmy and April approaching , coats draped over their arms . <p> " Hey you two , " Bryan said . " Do n't tell me you 're leaving already ? " <p> " She 's got to work tomorrow morning , " Jimmy said , smiling mildly into the air , squeezing April 's shoulders . April 's eyes were glittering with drink ; she leaned into Jimmy 's chest as though he 'd permanently bent her . She wore , Dana saw , dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know what I just found out ? " Bryan said to Dana , beaming . " These two are engaged . " <p> " Just last week , " April said . She held out her hand , and Dana , trying hard not to stare at Jimmy in outright amazement , pretended to examine the ring . <p> " That 's beautiful , " Dana said . <p> " Hey Jimmy , " Bryan said . " Let me talk at you for a minute . " <p> " Not work ? ' <p> " Just for a minute . " <p> " Can you believe this guy ? " Jimmy said , then winked at Dana again . Then he and Bryan walked away and Bryan began talking with his hands . <p> " He 's so funny , " April said . Dana did n't know which one of the men she meant . <p> " So , " Dana said-because she had to say something- " have you set a date ? " <p> Jimmy , twenty feet away , swept his eyes across her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her and she could expose him . She ought to . <p> April smiled at her question and scrunched up her face . <p> " Next June , " she said . <p> " Not long now , " Dana said , her throat tight . She tried to feel pity : this poor girl was clueless . Jimmy had probably fucked around on her dozens of times . Or maybe April knew , was following some blind hope that she 'd be able to change him , rein him in with a ring . <p> But either way , Dana could n't bring herself to think for long of April 's future , all the pain that was waiting for her out there . No . April was beautiful and lush , and when Dana looked at her she could n't help but imagine her kissing Jimmy , naked with Jimmy , in all her cheerleaderish glory , the two of them lit with amber light , as in a movie . If he had this , what could he possibly want with Dana ? <p> He wanted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dark and slim . And , of course , forbidden . <p> " Jimmy just loves your husband , " April was saying . " I got to talk to him tonight . He 's so nice " April leaned closer and put her hand on Dana 's wrist . Her breath smelled like wine . She whispered , " We 're both so lucky . " <p> Dana stared at her . <p> Jimmy and Bryan came back over to them then , Bryan laughing heartily and Jimmy smiling broadly at Dana . <p> " You guys be careful going home now , " Bryan said . <p> " Good-bye , " April said , shaking Dana 's hand . " It was so nice to meet you . " <p> " Congratulations , " Dana said . Then she shook Jimmy 's hand , coolly . <p> " Hope to see you around , " Jimmy said , grinning . <p> " I 'm sure you will , " she said , hoping that in this light no one could see the color in her cheeks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , drinking another egg-nog and trying not to be noticed . She watched Bryan work the room , traveling from one laughing knot of employees to the next . They all loved him . And they should-Bryan loved all of them . Dana tried not to think of Jimmy , of the feel of his stomach under her palm . But she could remember it with tremendous clarity , just by closing her eyes . <p> Half an hour later Bryan returned to her . <p> " Hi there , " he said . " I 'm sorry . OK ? " <p> He bent to kiss her temple ; she turned her head . She could n't help herself . <p> " I 'm sorry , too , " she said quickly . " I-I 'm not feeling well . " <p> " What is it ? " Bryan moved in close to her , putting a hand on her waist . " Honey ? " <p> " My stomach . I drank too much . " <p> Bryan began looking around , trying to spot , she guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat jingled . <p> She touched his elbow . " Honey , I 'm sorry-but can you run me home ? I do n't think I ought to drive , and I have to lie down . " <p> His eyes widened . He glanced around the room and then back . She had to admit a grim little satisfaction in screwing up his careful plans . Or else why would she have asked ? <p> " Yeah , " Bryan said . " Umm-let me talk to Dave and Mary- " <p> " OK . I 'll go sit in the car , all right ? I 'm sorry . " <p> Now she meant it . Bryan looked frantic . <p> Outside the snow was falling heavily ; the sculptured bushes growing against the brick of the reception hall were already prettily frosted . Dana moved carefully across the parking lot , steadying herself on the hoods of other cars , half expecting Jimmy to pop up from the shadows , smirking and beautiful . By the time she was inside the car , she had the shivers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her armpits , watching her breath curl smokily against the passenger window , and through it , the snow piling up on the hood of the next car over . <p> But this was only Ohio snow , only a tease . Dana had grown up in Colorado , where the snow did n't fuck around . She missed the mountains in winter , the acres of hip-deep snow that would never be tracked up , dirtied with slush . <p> The snow had been a lot heavier than this , the night of the accident . That was for sure . It had piled up on top of a coating of ice , riding winds that swirled over the caps of mountains . That was another thing you almost never saw in the Midwest : the kind of snowstorm that frightened you , that spawned disasters . <p> She 'd kissed another man . Jimmy had kissed her , and she 'd kissed him back , and then she 'd pushed him away . <p> Bryan opened the door and folded himself behind the wheel . " How you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She waved her hand . " Fresh air . " <p> " We 'll get you home . " Bryan stroked her knee . His voice was regretful . He was thinking , maybe , that he 'd have to hold her hair out of the way while she puked into the toilet . His hand lingered a bit on her knee , his thumb moving in circles . She put her hand over his and pressed down . Maybe she could convince herself the kiss had n't really happened . Bryan did n't deserve any of this : what she 'd done , what was in her head . <p> It had been a kiss , nothing more . In the end Dana had brushed off Jimmy in the right way . <p> Maybe when they were home , she could make amends . She would tell Bryan she 'd lied about being sick . Maybe she 'd pull him down on the bed before he went back to the party . She would n't even take off the dress . <p> Dana leaned her head back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , the dress would come off . Bryan had a thing about her belly . If it happened-if-he would end up sitting in front of her on the bed . He 'd kiss her navel , then stretch his long neck and lick at her nipples , and then he 'd sigh , I love you , Dana . He 'd say this three times during lovemaking . In the vicinity of her belly and breasts , and then when he entered her , and then again when he was coming . As though , if he did n't , the whole thing would fall apart ; as though Dana would roll out of bed , aghast . Each time he 'd say this , he 'd meet Dana 's eyes , checking . <p> I love you , too , she 'd say , each time . Or sometimes she 'd just kiss him , hard , putting her fingers in his hair . <p> Bryan would make love to her . <p> Jimmy would have fucked her . He 'd have no trouble using the word . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's card . <p> Without looking at her hands , she felt her purse , making sure the clasp was closed . She rubbed sweat off her palms and into the wool of her coat . The slick reflections of streetlights shone on the pavement . Bryan drove slowly , hunched over the wheel , hands at ten and two . The heater roared , and he muttered at the idiots who would n't slow down , who could n't see it was snowing , for crissakes . <p> At the time of the accident , Dana had been dating Bryan for two months . They were both students then at the University of Colorado . They 'd met in a statistics class . Their Japanese professor had trouble with names and kept an alphabetized seating chart ; Bryan was Macarthur , and Dana was McKinnon . They 'd started talking before class , then during the walk out of the room . Then they traded notes . She spent a long time looking at Bryan 's hands as he wrote ; his handwriting was beautiful and looping , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she finally held them , during a movie , she found they were delightfully soft . Soon after she took him to bed . <p> The ski trip was a surprise ; Bryan called her on a Friday morning and asked if she wanted to go away for the weekend . They drove up to Breckenridge with two of Bryan 's friends from the business program , tanned fraternity boys with perfect white teeth , who talked openly and excitedly about the snowbunnies they hoped to lay before the weekend was over . Dana thought she and Bryan were along only because Bryan drove a Cherokee that still smelled new . <p> But then , in their fake-Swiss chalet , after sex by the fireplace , Bryan told her he loved her , and Dana saw the weekend differently , as Bryan must have planned it : as a romantic getaway . A chance for fireside declarations . <p> Dana was n't sure then what exactly she felt for him . She liked him fine-but love ? She was charmed by his niceness ; everyone who knew him was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added up only to an outline of a man . He was n't handsome , though he was far from ugly . He was athletic , and liked to hike and run . He liked sitting under a blanket with her and watching television . He read a lot of science fiction . He was capable of talking for hours about banking or economic theory , and how he wanted to reform this or that . Sometimes he wrote letters to the school newspaper , about how , for instance , Democrats could never understand fiscal responsibility . When she talked about her homework , or about student teaching , he listened attentively , but he asked her questions in a way that always made her suspect he had rehearsed them . An entry in his Day Runner : things to ask Dana . <p> His family had money , but he was generous . He treated her to the weekend in Breckenridge , offered it in a way that did n't make her feel embarrassed , poor . He was nice , attentive to her , unfailingly polite . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , Dana was often bored . That boredom made her feel horribly petty , but she could n't rid herself of it , no matter how hard she tried . And on the ride up to Breckenridge , listening to his buddies pretend to laugh at his jokes , she understood she could never last with him . <p> She kept quiet as they settled into their room . But there , despite herself , she began having a good time . Bryan was more than cheerful , almost clownish . She liked the kitschy chalet with the big fireplace . She liked the enormous bed and the snowy domes of the mountains just outside their balcony . And she liked what she felt most guilty about : the sex with Bryan , on the bed , on the pile carpet in front of the fireplace . <p> Dana did n't want to be the sort of woman who would stay with a man because he was good in bed , which Bryan-to her surprise-was , and had been from the very beginning . His long , knobby body fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please her , had definite advantages . And he was so overjoyed to be with her that , for the first time since she 'd lost her virginity , she felt she was good at sex . She enjoyed telling Bryan to hold still , to lie back and let her take care of things . She liked the look he got on his face , stunned and worshipful . <p> And then , too , after sex with Bryan she felt different about everything . She 'd laze in bed with him , her head in the crook of his shoulder , and feel what she could only call contentment . She understood what she had always made fun of her girlfriends for insisting : that a man could make her feel safe . Lying next to Bryan , naked and drained , she was able to think about her grades , about paying her bills , about her coming job search , and not feel overwhelmed . <p> Whenever she thought she had to be done with him , that she could n't listen to him talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to one of those tranquil moments and she would wonder : is that what love is ? <p> And so , after he told her he loved her , Dana could only reply : I do n't know , Bryan . I 've never been in love before . I do n't want to say it if I do n't mean it . <p> OK , he said , looking down . That 's OK , Dana . <p> And there-she hurt for him . He turned away from her , naked and suddenly not so glad about it , and she wanted to hold him . <p> But not to tell him . <p> She said : Just give me time , OK ? <p> He nodded and put his face against her shoulder . <p> When they were dressed he said , Let 's go to dinner . The two of us alone . <p> Sure , she said brightly . That 'll be nice . <p> He drove her up and over Fremont Pass , to a little place in Leadville ; he had , it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd never doubted she 'd say she loved him , too . They had expensive steaks . Dana drank a lot of beer . Bryan , when he said anything , spoke with an edge of panic . <p> Halfway through dinner snow started coming down , hard , and the proprietor-a small , sideburned man with a belt buckle shaped like a buffalo-came over to their table and said that if they wanted to get back to Breckenridge tonight , they 'd better get a move on . <p> Outside , looking up at the sky , Dana felt her stomach twist . The sun was sinking , but she could n't see it . Tiny snowflakes prickled her cheeks , and the high bald mountains just to the north were vanishing , sinking back behind the swirling clouds , their flanks whiter than they 'd been on the drive in . <p> The highway up the pass was already thickly covered , but Bryan 's Cherokee did all right , grumbling along in low gear . They saw only one other car , taking the switchbacks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and off through the trees . Bryan 's lips were tight . She felt awful for him ; but that was n't the same as loving him , was it ? She wondered whether or not she should sleep with him when they got back to the chalet . What that would make her , if she did , or did n't . <p> At the top of the pass the winds rocked the Jeep ; the back wheels started to shimmy . The sun had fully set , and the snow seemed to jump out of the dark at the windshield . And then , slowing to ease around a sharp hairpin , Bryan said , Shit . Oh shit . <p> What ? she asked . He was going to say they were through ; she knew it , tensed for it . <p> Bryan pulled the Cherokee over to the side of the road . The other car , he said . I 've been following its tracks . Look . <p> In front of the Cherokee 's headlights Dana could just see the tracks the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight ahead-too straight . She understood : the car had n't turned . Up ahead on the bank was a broken section of guardrail , and above it , just visible , was a black window where the pine branches had been shaken naked of snow . <p> Then the wind picked up , and the whole road was lost in whiteout . Bryan might not have seen that curve , either . <p> The Cherokee had rolled to a stop and sat unevenly on a plow drift . Call 911 , Bryan told her , handing her his car phone . Then he opened his door . Dana dialed as he stumbled through the snow . She told the operator where they were . We 're sending someone , the operator said . Is anyone hurt ? <p> I do n't know . My boyfriend is trying to get to the car . <p> Bryan looked over the edge of the road , then turned back to her , stricken . <p> When Dana hung up she climbed down out of the Cherokee and tried to follow Bryan 's tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten degrees , and the snow hit her face like flung sand . Dana could just hear a noise over the wind , though : a scream-a woman's-harsh and scraping . <p> In high school Dana had worked as a lifeguard . She tried now to recall her CPR training , but she could n't think of what to do , only how nervous she 'd been on the job . What would she do if anyone screamed for help ? If someone down below in the water stopped moving ? Dana had never seen anything truly awful in her life that was not on television . She paused in the snow . This was it : this was the emergency . Someone would n't scream like that unless she was in agony . This was going to be blood and bone . <p> Hurry ! Bryan shouted , and dropped off the edge of the road . <p> The slope fell away steeply ; Dana remembered from the drive in that the drop was hundreds of feet , down to a twisting riverbed . But in the snow and dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked car , still shining , maybe fifty feet below . The trees were sparse near the road and then thickened farther down . The snow on the slope was unbroken . The car must have gone airborne , having ramped off the road and then gotten caught up in the trees . Now it lay turned over on its roof , jammed against three pines grown close together , like a wall . <p> Bryan blundered down twenty feet ahead , plowing a trail . Dana followed him . Off the road the wind was a little quieter . But the screams were louder : Dana thought she could see dashlights through one of the car 's side windows . She could smell gasoline , exhaust : they stood out , here in the clean , cold air . <p> Bryan was sliding down the steepest part now on his hip , and then he was at the wreck . Dana followed , faster , heart thumping in her throat , snow finding its way under her clothing , next to her skin . The underside of the car-a sedan-was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree branches overhead and sizzled and smoked . This close , the smell of gas was heavy and moist , like something she could spit whole from her mouth . <p> The sedan 's passenger window faced uphill , and was broken ; this was where the screams were coming from . Bryan knelt down and looked inside . The wind caught his hair , tufting it . And then-just when he called out , Hello ? - the car caught fire . <p> The flames bloomed out , black and blue and orange , from the rear of the car , like the petals of a flower opening up . Dana stood transfixed by them-by the shifting colors , the gentle push of warmth against her cheeks . For a moment the fire felt good . But then it blazed up higher , brighter , hurting her eyes , following lines across the car 's underbelly , up toward the people inside . And Bryan . <p> The woman screamed louder . Bryan shielded his eyes , sat back on his haunches , and made a deep wordless sound , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few feet from his head . The tree trunks had lines of fire on them now , like glowing vines . Dana flinched back , moving crablike up the slope as the heat grew , as the flames traveled up and up . The skin on her face tightened . She could barely think . She saw Bryan in outline next to the car , rocking forward and back with his arm flung up , the fire making a noise now , that familiar whoosh and mutter over the howling of the wind , the trees all around gaining outline and shadow and everything moving . <p> And Bryan bent forward . Dana wanted to scream No ! but she could n't . He dropped to his hands and knees and crawled through the narrow broken window until only his legs were visible . <p> She should have moved forward . She remembered wanting to-not to save the screaming woman , but to save Bryan , to grab his legs and pull him back out . He was going to die , she knew . She was watching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been more frightened of anything in her life . The woods and the flames loomed up . She could not feel her body anymore ; she was somewhere between herself and Bryan , somewhere up in the air . That was the only way she could think to describe it to herself , later . <p> Bryan 's knees twisted and dug into the snow . The fire was inside the sedan : she could see its glow on the dashboard past Bryan 's shadow . The screams intensified . Bryan grunted , then shouted : Pull it ! Pull ! You have to ! The trees were catching , the branches crackling . Underneath the snow , the wood was still kindling-dry from the past summer 's drought . Sparks fell down over the car in little firework showers . <p> And then Bryan wriggled out . He was smoking ; his arms were smoking . He ducked as the fire licked over his head , into the front wheel well . Then he knelt again and reached into the car and pulled out the woman . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a ski jacket , and it was on fire . Her arms beat at the window frame , at Bryan . Bryan heaved and she came free , legs trailing uselessly . She was shrieking like an animal . Bryan kept dragging her away from the car . His face twisted away from the burning woman , his cheekbones glowing a ghastly yellow . <p> Bryan 's own jacket caught flame . He gave the woman one last heave , then wrapped her in his arms and rolled both of them into the deep snow . <p> Dana ! he called , his voice torn , a screech . <p> And that moved her . Her limbs came unlocked . Bryan was alive . <p> Dana floundered across the slope to him , threw handfuls of snow on his back and arms . He was trying to take off his jacket , which was smoking , flaming . Dana grabbed hold of one of the sleeves and pulled . A new smell , like meat cooking , was coming out of the car . Someone was still inside , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bryan , too , off of the woman . Parts of his jacket had melted and clung in strands to his arm and shoulder . His hair was smoking . Dana felt a searing pain on her own forearm where his jacket was twisted around it . She jammed it deep into the snow until she felt the cold seep into the pain . <p> The woman was n't screaming anymore . Dana looked at her , even though she did n't want to . She had blond hair , now streaked with blood , burnt away down to the skull on one side . Her face was a mess : rust red where it was n't blackened . She was awake , Dana saw , her mouth opening and closing , panting almost . The woman 's eyes-the whites were shockingly bright against her swollen cheeks-kept rolling from side to side . <p> Come on , Bryan said . <p> He could n't use his right arm . Dana 's own arm hurt , but she put her hands under one of the woman 's arms , and Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her up the slope , away from the burning car , the blazing stinking white fire of the burning tires , the smell of the man burning inside-her husband . They found this out later . Her husband . They were locals . He 'd been drinking and going way too fast . <p> He died before the fire , Bryan told her that night in the hospital . He spoke during a brief period of wakefulness before they medicated him into oblivion . He lay very still , his arm bandaged up to the shoulder . <p> Bryan whispered : His neck was broken . I checked . <p> As though she was worried he might not have rescued enough people , as though she was angry at him for having failed . Dana was glad the man had been dead . If he 'd been alive , Bryan would have gone back in for him , and both of them would be dead now . She knew that . <p> Is she all right ? Bryan asked . His lips were swollen , cracked . <p> She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll live . <p> But the woman had lived . Her back was broken , and she was horribly scarred , but she was still alive , living now with a sister in Colorado Springs . She and Bryan exchanged Christmas cards . <p> Bryan had nodded , then closed his eyes . <p> Looking back , Dana was n't sure when it happened , when the moment that changed everything occurred . Before the crash she had been ready to leave Bryan . But sitting next to his hospital bed , she felt she 'd rather die than abandon him again . She felt . . . peaceful : the same sort of peace that had always settled around her after making love to him , curled against his long , thin body . But she could n't say what had happened to make it so . Bryan had done a wonderful , courageous thing-had done it without thinking . And when he had gone into the car , Dana had lost herself : a part of her had come unmoored and waited for Bryan to come out alive before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her insides seemed to pull her down to him . She whispered to Bryan : I love you . <p> And saying it to him felt good , true . <p> Bryan smiled up at her , even though she knew it must hurt his mouth . His good hand brushed hers . Then the painkillers caught him , and he drifted away . <p> Now , in the car , Dana dozed . She dreamed , as she often did , about the accident . Sometimes she had nightmares : she was the woman trapped in the car , screaming to Bryan , who paced outside in the snow , deciding . But sometimes the scene did n't frighten her at all . Tonight she dreamed that she never got out of the Cherokee , that she watched the whole thing on television , inside , knowing how it was going to turn out . <p> " Honey , " Bryan said , shaking her , " we 're home . " <p> She walked all the way into the house before remembering she 'd kissed Jimmy . <p> Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her waist , as though she might fall over . Bryan pulled back the bedcovers and she lay down on the cool sheets , stretching herself . She started to bend her knees , to reach down for a heel , but he stilled her with a hand . She closed her eyes : he was going to undress her . Her blood surged . If he made love to her now she would forget Jimmy . She 'd feel the familiar rub of her husband 's stomach , his hipbones-how could she have forgotten that ? <p> Bryan slipped off one of her heels , then the other . Then he reached up under her dress to grab the waistband of her hose . She let him lift her hips . His fingers curled under the fabric , next to her skin . The fingers on his left hand were soft , the ones on his right a little rough and bumpy , from the scars . She liked the feel of her hose sliding down her thighs and off . <p> " Are you awake ? " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Turn on your side . I 'll unzip you . " <p> " No , " she said . She opened her eyes and curled her heel around the back of his thigh . His loosened tie fell into a jumble on her collarbone . She used it to pull him in closer , between her legs . <p> Bryan said , " Huh , " but he let himself be pulled . " I thought you were sick . " <p> She kissed him , tightening her calves around his rear end . <p> " Sick of the party , " she murmured . " That 's all . " She lifted her hips and dropped them and lifted them again . <p> " Honey , " he said . <p> They had n't made love for a long time after the accident . The first time was in the summer . Bryan had taken a semester off , staying at his parents ' house in Columbus . His family flew Dana out from school to see him on weekends . Once the bandages were off , Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But one night , while his parents were out , Dana undressed him , insisting . <p> It 's awful , he told her , not meeting her eyes . I wo n't blame you if <p> Nothing about you could ever be awful , she said . <p> His arm and his chest looked bad-worse than she 'd imagined , the tissue there the color of baked ham-but she did n't let it show on her face . Instead , she leaned down to kiss him on his ribs , found the scars dry and hard under her lips . The sensation was n't bad ; she was reminded of touching a friend 's pet boa , finding the scales dry and smooth . Can you feel that ? she asked . No , he whispered . It 's all right , she told him . She had seen terrible things , and Bryan 's arm was not one of them . His hips were fine and his thighs were fine . His lips were still soft and gentle , the touch of his good hand light . His hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silky and untouched . Rocking , she watched his eyes , which were lovely and brown and kind . <p> He cried when they were done , holding her against the soft left side of his body . I love you , he said , hoarse . I love you , too , she said . I will always love you . That he loved her , that he had looked at the fire and chosen to suffer it , both seemed to come from the same place in him . He had seen , each time , what she had n't been brave enough to see . She sighed next to him , traced his nipple with her fingers , touched his scars . She would not let herself be repulsed by him . <p> But ever since , he preferred to keep his shirt on all the same . <p> Now Dana loosened his tie , pushed it over his head . <p> " Honey , " he said , as she started to unbutton his shirt . " Honey . " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . " <p> " You lied to me , " he said , smiling . <p> " A little . Come on . " <p> " I have to get back , " he said . " You know that . " <p> " Not yet . " <p> " Later , " he said . " I 'll be back in two hours . " <p> " Bryan . . . " <p> He rolled on his side , away from her . " Just two hours . Sleep until I get back . " He saw her face . " Look , " he said . " People need to get home . I promised I 'd drive some of them . You do n't want them out on the roads , do you ? " <p> He could be condescending when she 'd been drinking . <p> " I wo n't be awake in two hours . " <p> He sighed . " I appreciate the gesture , I do , but . . . I ca n't just abandon my post . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , Bryan . " Dana sat up and let out a breath . <p> He kissed her hair . " It 's my job . " <p> She knew what this would do to him . He could n't stand her being upset . He 'd be frantic until he could get back to her . <p> " Go , " she said . <p> " No . Look , I can stay . Let me call- " <p> " Bryan , go , " she said . " The moment 's passed , all right ? " <p> " Two hours , " he said . " Not even that . " <p> She thought he looked relieved . <p> When he was gone , she undressed and slid under the covers . She looked at her own arm on the bedspread : pale , spotted here and there with moles . Her one scar twisted up and around her wrist . They 'd had to pull some of Bryan 's melted jacket off her skin , like a piece of taffy stuck to its wrapper . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ? She was n't as scarred as Bryan ; Bryan was n't as scarred as the woman he 'd pulled from the car , who was hideous , wheelchair bound . And the woman was alive-her husband was not . <p> Poor , drunk April had been half right : Dana was lucky . <p> But she thought of Jimmy anyway , the card he 'd slipped her . She remembered the way he had kissed her , the feel of his hand on her rear . She thought-she could n't help herself-of his smooth , muscular chest . Of bare , unscarred skin under her hands . He 'd be quick , inconsiderate . He would not tell her he loved her . But he 'd be good . Dana pictured April with her back arched , Jimmy 's blond head turning between her thighs . <p> At three-thirty Bryan came home . Dana pretended to be asleep , listening to him undressing with great care in the dark , sliding gently into bed next to her . His arm crept across her waist . She felt a gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Wake me up , she thought . Touch me . <p> But he did n't . He curled next to her , and soon he was snoring , his arm limp and heavy across her hip . <p> In the hospital in Denver , Dana had insisted on sitting next to Bryan after the doctors cleaned and bandaged him . She was told at first she was n't allowed , but one of the paramedics who had brought them in told the story : that this man was a hero . Dana heard the nurses whispering to each other about it . Dana , bandaged herself , would n't let go of Bryan 's good hand . His right arm was bandaged thickly to the shoulder . His hair was burnt on one side ; his right cheek was blotchy and blistered . He stank . A nurse put her hand on Dana 's shoulder , and said : He 'll be under soon . We 're giving him painkillers . <p> Can I stay until he sleeps ? Dana asked . Bryan watched her with glazed eyes , murmuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After a long sigh the nurse said , All right . She bustled around the dark room . Bryan closed his eyes , let out a long , whistling breath . <p> Then Dana saw the nurse was looking at her , smiling hopefully . <p> Is it true ? the nurse asked . What he did ? <p> It 's true , Dana said . She was n't surprised when the nurse embraced her . <p> When the nurse had gone , Dana leaned over and kissed Bryan , pressing carefully , softly , against his swollen lips . Bryan murmured again . His breathing was so gentle she had to keep very still in order to feel it . She uncovered his good arm from beneath the sheet and traced it with her fingers . She whispered to him that she loved him . She told him about the wedding they would have , the names of the children they would have . She let herself go , into every dream she 'd ever dared have . <p> When that car burst into flames , she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a second , had dived forward ; he had saved the woman 's life . That was the sort of person he was . Dana had thought about this at the hospital , her hand on Bryan 's wrist , her mouth close to his ear-and had decided what she was , too . She had n't cared if the woman in the car had lived or died ; she had n't thought of her at all . Her thoughts , all the rest of her life , had reached out and clung to Bryan , gone with him twice into the burning car , until her future depended on whether he came out again . And he had . <p> She recalled now Jimmy 's card , crumpled in her purse . The flat muscles of his stomach under her palm . The way he 'd looked at her . <p> More and more these days she was remembering : when the fire started , she 'd had one other thought . <p> Her heart had gone to Bryan , yes . . . but just before that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seen nothing , but the flames . They 'd bloomed across the underside of the car : deep black , then a lovely shifting blue , then curling orange . <p> And she was the sort of woman who could be filled up by them , whose body could sway to them . Because they were so strange , so beautiful . Because in that terrible wind and cold she had been so grateful for their heat . <p>
