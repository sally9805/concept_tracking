Sun to Sun // I was nine years old when I met my father . His name was M. C. Thomas , and my birth certificate describes him as a " laborer . " My mother divorced him in 1950 and he moved north to Philadelphia , leaving his family behind in Pinpoint , the tiny Georgia community where I was born . I saw him only twice when I was young . The first time was when my mother called her parents , with whom my brother Myers and I then lived , and told them that someone at her place wanted to see us . They called a cab and sent us to her housing-project apartment , where my father was waiting . " I am your daddy , " he told us in a firm , shameless voice that carried no hint of remorse for his inexplicable absence from our lives . He said nothing about loving or missing us , and we did n't say much in return  --  it was as though we were meeting a total stranger  --  but he treated us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of Elgin watches with flexible bands , which were popular at the time . Though we watched the mail every day , the watches never came , and when a year or so had gone by , my grandparents bought them for us instead . My father had broken the only promise he ever made to us . After that we heard nothing more from him , not even a Christmas or birthday card . For years my brother and I would ask ourselves how a man could show no interest in his own children . I still wonder . // I saw him for the second time after I graduated from high school . He had come to see his own father in Montgomery , not far from Pinpoint , and I went there to visit him . I felt I owed it to him  --  he was , after all , my father , and he had let my grandparents raise me without interference  --  but Myers would have nothing to do with " C , " as we called him , saying that the only father we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was nothing more than the truth , for me as much as my brother . In every way that counts , I am my grandfather 's son . I even called him Daddy because that was what my mother called him . ( His friends called him Mike . ) He was dark , strong , proud , and determined to mold me in his image . For a time I rejected what he taught me , but even then I still yearned for his approval . He was the one hero in my life . What I am is what he made me. // I am descended from the West African slaves who lived on the barrier islands and in the low country of Georgia , South Carolina , and coastal northern Florida . In Georgia my people were called Geechees ; in South Carolina , Gullahs . They were isolated from the rest of the population , black and white alike , and so maintained their distinctive dialect and culture well into the twentieth century . What little remains of Geechee life is now celebrated by scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Geechee " was a derogatory term for Georgians who had profoundly Negroid features and spoke with a foreign-sounding accent similar to the dialects heard on certain Caribbean islands . // Much of my family tree is lost to me , its secrets having gone to the grave with my grandparents , but I know that Daddy 's people worked on a three-thousand-acre rice plantation in Liberty County , just south of Savannah , and after their manumission they stayed nearby . The maternal side of my mother 's family also came from Liberty County , and probably worked on the same plantation , most of which has remained intact . Not long ago I saw it for the first time  --  during my youth blacks never went there unless they had a good reason  --  and found that the old barn in which my great-great-grandparents surely labored a century and a half ago is now a bed-and-breakfast inn whose Web site calls it " a perfect honeymoon hideaway . " You 'd never guess that slaves once worked there . // My mother , Leola , whom I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedlock in 1929 or 1930 . Her mother died in childbirth , and she saw little of Daddy as a child . At first she was raised by her maternal grandmother , who died when she was eight or nine years old . Then she went to live in Pinpoint with Annie Green , her mother 's sister . C and his family moved near there to work at Bethesda Home for Boys , which is next to Pinpoint ; that was where he met Pigeon , all of whose children he sired . My sister , Emma Mae , was born in 1946 , with Myers Lee following three years later . I was born between them in Sister Annie 's house on June 23 , 1948 . I was delivered by Lula Kemp , a midwife who came from the nearby community of Sandfly . It was one of those sweltering Georgia nights when the air is so wet that you can barely draw breath . To this day my mother swears I was too stubborn to cry . // Pinpoint is a heavily wooded twenty-five-acre peninsula on Shipyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savannah . A shady , quiet enclave full of pines , palms , live oaks , and low-hanging Spanish moss , it feels cut off from the rest of the world , and it was even more isolated in the fifties than it is today . Then as now , Pinpoint was too small to be properly called a town . No more than a hundred people lived there , most of whom were related to me in one way or another . Their lives were a daily struggle for the barest of essentials : food , clothing , and shelter . Doctors were few and far between , so when you got sick , you stayed that way , and often you died of it . The house in which I was born was a shanty with no bathroom and no electricity except for . . . //
