Step One : Problem <p> High in the mountains of Cameroon , West Africa , there was a small lake surrounded by green , treeless cliffs  --  Lake Nyos . No river emptied into Lake Nyos ; it was fed by rain from above and springs from below , leaving the surface utterly still  --  a blue jewel set in a mountaintop , penetrated by slanted bars of light . Water trickled gently from it into a valley that held three small villages of cattle herders . <p> Summer was usually the rainy season , but the August of 1986 had been dry . Then , on the evening of the twenty-first , a warm , pelting rain began to fall . Children came outside to run through the grass and slide in the mud , while cows lumbered into the shelter of the great , waxy-leafed trees . <p> The cattle here were of an African variety that Idahoans would never have seen : giants with great wide horns and spines that hung like suspension bridges between humps at the shoulder and hip . As majestic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they looked more like wild things  --  water buffalo or wildebeest  --  than anything you 'd raise and eat . Those Idahoans who saw the news reports in the following days , which showed these animals twisted languidly in death , imagined that , in life , they had moved regally , their muscles rolling and twitching under their sleek coats . The Idahoans fixed their minds on the death of these cows rather than the cows ' owners . A cow lying dead with flies in its eyes was a common enough sight . <p> The rain died off at sunset . Then , in the middle of the night , a gust of wind blew through the villages and up over the mountains . This was n't a howling tempest ; it did n't have force enough to snap limbs off trees , just to flap the leaves and send down a second , lesser shower . Nobody even woke up . But the wind moved the blanket of rain water across the surface of Lake Nyos . Like a tablecloth that one pushes across a tabletop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , the warm water collected in one corner , then slipped down the side , past the still strata of frigid water , to the depths where something lay sleeping . The villagers , who regarded Lake Nyos alternately as a benevolent mother and a sanctuary for evil spirits , would later say it was the Lake Witch . She awoke , swam up the opposite side of Lake Nyos , and emerged from the water with a groan and a rumble . A few villagers woke and sat up in bed , wondering , Was it a dream ? Seconds later their breath was taken from them , and they fell back onto their pillows . Their family members sleeping across the room did n't even awaken , but made a few gasping snores before they died . Outside , cows fell on their knees , surged to heave themselves back up , then rolled onto their sides . Birds dropped like black fruit from the trees . A bat swooped to catch an insect that had fallen dead , but failed , died , and tumbled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a higher altitude did n't die , but flitted away to find a fresher meal elsewhere . <p> Farther down the valley , the Lake Witch seemed to tire . She allowed the people of the next village to rouse their children and make it outdoors before they fell . She let them feel the struggle of their children gasping for air under them before taking their lives . <p> Dawn came hot and steaming . A man used a switch both to drive his five cows up the road and to swat the biting flies from his own ankles . He entered the trail of the Lake Witch where there were no more flies , but he did not notice this . The buzzing and chirping , which never stopped , had stopped , but until the man came upon that first dead cow , he could n't name the chill . <p> A similar , though much less ominous , disorientation  --  a gap between feeling the chill and naming it  --  was experienced only days later by Connie Anderson in Eula , Idaho . Temperatures had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk one Thursday , when husbands were plugging in their Weedwhackers to charge them up for the weekend , and wives were turning on their sewing machines , and everyone was tuning their TVs to Hill Street Blues , which was thought to be set in New York City ( where few Eulans had ever been but which seemed gritty and fascinating and made their own lives seem dull , yes , but clean ) , the electricity , already overtaxed by air conditioners that had been running all day , went out . <p> Connie happened to be leaving First Church of the Nazarene at that moment . She and some women from her group , the Dorcas Circle , had volunteered to change the decorations in the sanctuary . They had taken down garlands of plastic roses from the stained-glass windows , replaced them with bunches of Indian corn , and propped up sheaves of dried cattails and corn stalks in the corners . The last to leave , Connie stepped out of the church and opened her purse to look for her keys . She found them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the handrail in case she was fainting . A dog 's insistent bark echoed in the distance . A car passed , and its tires on the smooth road made a sound like breath . Above Connie , clouds hung like knotted wool blankets that had been dipped in gold on the edge closest to the horizon , behind which the sun had dropped . The scarlet haze on the horizon and the faint odor of spice were due , Connie knew , to the wildfires that had been burning steadily for several days in the brush lands across the Snake River from Eula . Small clouds suspended above the haze in the west shone like nuggets . Then , before Connie could name the difference , the streetlights flickered on , and the windows of the houses glowed , and something buzzed  --  the power line that entered the church building above Connie 's head , which she never would have noticed otherwise . <p> <br> Continues ...
