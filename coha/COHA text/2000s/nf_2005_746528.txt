The Straits of Malacca and Singapore are the main seaway connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea and together are the shortest route for tankers trading between the Middle East and Far East Asian countries . Consequently , traffic transiting the region is considerably heavy reported to be approximately 60,000 vessels a year . In addition , there are a considerable number of local vessels engaged in trade across the straits ; numerous fishing vessels can be encountered in most areas . <p> The narrowest point of this shipping lane is 1.2 miles wide , located near Batu Berhanti , in the Singapore Strait ; it creates a natural bottleneck , with the potential for collisions and/or groundings that could result in pollution of the marine environment. ( n1 ) While it is by no means clear that the straits could be closed , if for some reason they were closed , nearly half the world 's fleet would be required to sail more than 500 miles farther , prolonging voyage times and generating a substantial increase in the requirement for vessel capacity . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be absorbed , which would have the strongest impact on crude-oil shipments and dry-bulk cargoes such as coal . Closure of the straits could be expected to immediately raise freight rates worldwide. ( n2 ) <p> The increasing number of violent and well-coordinated attacks on transiting ships in the straits is a serious problem in and of itself ( n3 ) and has suggested that the attacks might be dry runs for a more serious terror attack on shipping. ( n4 ) Conversely , some terrorism experts have expressed the view that there is no link between these attacks and terrorist elements , and that there is no evidence that the attackers and terrorists are working together in the straits to launch a terror attack against ship ping . Nevertheless , the straits are vulnerable to such acts. ( n5 ) <p> Other threats to shipping in the straits include sea piracy in international waters ; armed robbery against ships in national and international waters ; smuggling of drugs , migrants , arms and commercial goods ; transportation of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and related materials by sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Straits of Malacca and Singapore face the constant threat of unauthorized boardings ; theft of personal property , cargo and the ships themselves ; and violence against and kidnapping or murder of seafarers . <p> The difficulty of protecting shipping from these threats in the straits results from the simple fact that criminals and law enforcement officials are not bound by the same rules . Criminals do not respect maritime borders or national sovereignty , while law enforcement and military officials respect both these limits , particularly in light of strong regional there is a real need to level the playing field by facilitating international cooperation and enhancing regional capacity to suppress illicit activity at sea . <p> This paper reviews steps that have been taken , and that are envisioned , to enhance maritime security in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore . Of particular note are recent calls by senior officials from Malaysia and Indonesia for international cooperation and assistance to that end. ( n6 ) Of particular concern is the fact that the details of this cooperation and assistance have not been identified . They should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Location and Characteristics(n7) <p> The Straits of Malacca and Singapore extend for approximately 520 nautical miles ( see Figure 1 ) and together comprise the longest strait used for international navigation . The Straits of Malacca is located between the east coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the west coast of peninsular Malaysia . The Singapore Straits is located south of both the island of Singapore and the south eastern tip of peninsular Malaysia , and north of the Indonesian Rian Islands . The straits provide the shortest sea route between the Indian Ocean ( via the Andaman Sea ) and the Pacific Ocean ( via the South China Sea ) . <p> At the broad western entrance to the Strait of Malacca , the coasts of Indonesia and Malaysia are separated by about 200 nm . The strait , however , begins to funnel in a southeasterly direction . At 3N and south of One Fathom Bank , the 12-mile territorial seas of Indonesia and Malaysia overlap. ( n8 ) The narrowest part of the Strait of Malacca is at the southwestern tip of the Malay Peninsula ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow depth , is much narrower for deep-draught vessels . <p> The narrowest breadth of the Singapore Strait is just 3.2 miles , and throughout its length it is constantly less than 15 miles wide . Indonesia claims a 12-mile territorial sea , and Singapore claims 3 miles . At its eastern outlet into the South China Sea , where it is bordered solely by Malaysia and Indonesia , the sea passage is approximately 11.1 miles wide . <p> The governing depth of the Straits of Malacca is less than 75 feet , with a tidal range between 4.6 feet at the eastern outlet of the Singapore Strait and 12.5 feet at the western entrance to the Straits of Malacca. ( n9 ) The draughts of many large ships using the straits closely approach the controlling depths ; therefore , tidal heights are critical for the safety of the ships . In addition , there are reported to be numerous wrecks and shoal patches in the Straits , some of which are in close proximity to the fairways . <p> The tidal range in the straits varies according to location , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank in the Straits of Malacca to 5 feet in the area of Horsburgh Light at the eastern end of the Singapore Strait . The tidal flow is influenced by the northwesterly current and can vary considerably , ranging from about 1.5 knots in the north to some 3 knots in the more restricted channels . In the vicinity of Singapore the tidal streams can attain rates of some 6 knots with associated eddies and overfalls . These strong tidal streams cause large uniform sandwaves on the seabed , which form at right angles to the water flow and can vary in height from 13 to 23 feet . Sizeable sand ridges also form parallel to the tidal streams . <p> The climate of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore is typically equatorial with uniform high temperature , high humidity and copious rainfall . There are no distinct wet or dry months as rain falls during every month of the year . Two main seasons can be distinguished , namely the Northeast Monsoon , which generally lasts from late November to March , and the Southwest Monsoon , from May to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prevailing winds are generally northwest to northeast during the Northeast Monsoon and southeast to southwest during the Southwest Monsoon . Wind speeds on average are below 10 knots throughout the year , although occasional strong gusts are likely when showers or thunderstorms are in the vicinity . <p> The most significant weather phenomenon during the Southwest Monsoon is the occasional occurrence of late-night and early-morning thunderstorm squalls known as " Sumatras . " These storms usually give rise to southwest and northwest winds gusting to 30 knots that are accompanied by heavy rain . A strong Sumatra may produce winds of up to 50 knots or higher . However , although the onset of these storms is sudden , adverse weather conditions associated with them seldom persist more than one or two hours . Moderate to light rain may continue to fall for several hours . <p> The sea is almost invariably smooth or slight within the straits . Visibility in general used to be good over the whole area except during heavy rain showers , although haze has become a regular occurrence , occasionally becoming very thick. ( n10 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's annual merchant-fleet tonnage passes through the Straits of Malacca , Sunda and Lombok , with the majority continuing on into the South China Sea . Oil flows through the strait leading into the South China Sea are three times greater than those through the Suez Canal/Sumed Pipeline , and fifteen times greater than oil flows through the Panama Canal . Virtually all shipping that passes through the Malacca and Sunda Straits must pass near the Spratly Islands . The other major shipping lane in the region is a route through the Lombok and Makassar Straits , and continues into the Philippine Sea . Except for north-south traffic from Australia , it is not used as extensively as the Straits of Malacca and Singapore and the South China Sea , since , for most voyages , it represents a longer voyage by several hundred miles . <p> Cargo shipped by tonnage in the South China Sea is dominated by raw materials en route to East Asian countries . Tonnage via Malacca and the Spratly Islands is dominated by liquid bulk such as crude oil and liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iron ore . Nearly two-thirds of the tonnage passing through the straits , and half of the volume passing the Spratly Islands , consists of crude oil from the Persian Gulf . Oil flows through the straits were 10.3 million barrels per day ( b/d ) in 2002 , and rising demand for oil in Asia could almost double these flows over the next two decades . <p> Southeast Asian nations are heavily dependent upon energy shipments through the South China Sea . More than 80 percent of the crude-oil supplies for Japan and the Republic of Korea flow through the area from the Middle East , Africa and South China Sea nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia . LNG and coal from Indonesia , South Africa and Vietnam are also shipped via this route . As a result , about two thirds of the Republic of Korea 's and almost 60 percent of Japan 's energy supplies flow through this sea area . <p> Because of its strategic significance and high volume of traffic , the Straits of Malacca and Singapore remain one of the most important shipping lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase , especially in terms of oil trans port . About 11 million b/d currently pass through the straits , but that is set to climb as oil consumption in developing Asian nations rises by an estimated average of 3 percent per annum between now and 2025 . In accordance with some forecasts , China alone will account for one-third of that increase , which will see demand growth doubling to nearly 30 million b/d in 2025 , from 14.5 million b/d in 2000 . Much of the additional supply will be imported from the Middle East and Africa , and most of this volume would need to pass through the straits . Piracy and Armed Robbery Against Ships <p> The large volume of merchant shipping in the South China Sea and the Straits of Malacca and Singapore has been targeted by numerous attacks . Attacked ships included oil-product tankers such as the Thai-flag Tenyu off the coast of Malaysia in 1999 ; the Singapore-owned Petro Ranger off the coast of Malaysia , sailing from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City ; the Indonesian-flagged Atlanta in the Riau Straits off Sumatra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Malaysia. ( n12 ) <p> Before reviewing briefly the number and character of incidents , it is important to clarify the terminology used in the analysis . <p> There are two organizations that regularly compile and report attacks and attempted attacks against merchant shipping : the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , a specialized agency within the United Nations , and the International Maritime Bureau ( IMB ) , a specialized division of the International Chamber of Commerce ( ICC ) . ( n13 ) They use different definitions . <p> The IMO defines " piracy " as it is defined in the international law of the sea , and " armed robbery against ships " as all other unlawful acts against ships , persons or property on board. ( n14 ) The principal difference between these definitions lies in the fact that the international crime of " piracy " can only occur on the high seas and in exclusive economic zones ; by definition it can not occur in territorial seas , archipelagic waters or internal waters . <p> On the other hand , the IMB uses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all acts against merchant ships wherever located , whether or not the act fits within the legal definition of piracy. ( n15 ) <p> Of the 330 incidents worldwide reported to the IMO in 2004 , 113 occurred in the South China Sea and 60 took place in the straits , amounting to more than half of the global total . This trend continued during the first half of 2005 ; of the 113 incidents reported worldwide to the IMO , the South China Sea accounted for 48 and the straits 12 , again making up over half of the incidents reported. ( n16 ) <p> The number of reports to the International Maritime Bureau are comparable . Of the 325 reports of actual and attempted attacks worldwide in 2004 , 46 were in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore ; of the 127 such reports for the first half of 2005 , 14 were in the straits. ( n17 ) <p> Regional governments question the validity of these statistics. ( n18 ) Malaysia , in particular , has recently insisted that its waters are free of these incidents. ( n19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the numbers , to the descriptions of the acts in the IMO 's monthly reports and the IMB 's annual and semi-annual reports on piracy and armed robbery against ships , for a more detailed examination of the crimes . Nevertheless , whatever definitions are used , one fact is undisputed : ships and their crews transiting the Straits of Malacca and Singapore face serious and continuing threats of unauthorized boardings ; theft of personal property , cargo and the ships themselves ; and violence against and kidnapping or murder of seafarers . Other Security Threats <p> Given the nature and volume of trade passing through the straits , they are wide considered to be a prime target for terrorists intending to disrupt international commerce ; there have been indications that this is a valid analysis. ( n20 ) <p> The recent increase in violent and well-coordinated pirate attacks in the straits has been seen by some officials as a dry run for a terror attack on shipping . However , other terrorism experts reject the existence of links between terrorist activity and the shipping attacks. ( n21 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Lloyd 's Market Association Joint War Committee , added the straits to a list of 21 areas it deemed high-risk for merchant ships and prone to war , strikes , terrorism and other such perils. ( n22 ) This action did not automatically affect rates or cause cancellation for insurance policies ' standard war-risk clauses , ( n23 ) but it produced a chorus of calls for reconsideration , ( n24 ) which so far has not changed the committee 's recommendation . <p> Other illegal activities , often of greater concern to the littoral states , include cross-straits drug trafficking ; smuggling of migrants and of goods such as cigarettes , ; transportation of WMD and related materials by sea ; and oil pollution . Seafarers remain in constant danger when passing through the straits. ( n25 ) NEED FOR COOPERATION <p> In light of their colonial history , the littoral states have traditionally been concerned with preserving their sovereignty and territorial integrity from outside interference . They have correctly pointed out that it is their responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the Straits of Malacca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have capability to protect even their own portions of the Straits of Malacca . In addition , they have traditionally been reluctant to cooperate sufficiently among themselves to make their maritime boundaries effectively permeable for action by other states ' law enforcement forces . Perhaps due to a lack of mutual trust , law enforcement vessels in pursuit of criminals have not been permitted to enter foreign territorial seas . This creates havens for the criminals and abets criminal activity in the straits . <p> As a practical matter , cooperation is essential if maritime security for the straits and its seafarers is to be achieved . Detection , monitoring and interdiction efforts have to focus on hundreds of square miles of ocean , and such cases occur at all hours of the day . The littoral states have to permit pursuit and entry of their neighbors ' maritime law enforcement vessels and aircraft . Law enforcement personnel need mechanisms for rapidly obtaining authorization from a coastal state for pursuit and entry into its territorial sea and archipelagic waters , and for boarding and detention of suspect vessels from the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is required to establish these mechanisms on an expedited basis . Benefits of Formal Cooperation <p> Formalized cooperation ensures that decisions on the exercise of enforcement jurisdiction always remain with the coastal or flag state . Furthermore , it deprives criminals of " safe havens " ; permits the sharing of scarce law enforcement resources ; accelerates the request-response process ; and reduces the burden on the parties because systems are already in place to act . When formalized , cooperation is limited to suspect vessels and aircraft ; the effect on legitimate commerce is minimal . Finally , cooperation between flag and coastal states facilitates better supervision of flag-state merchant fleets . Bases for Cooperation <p> Two basic requirements must be met to achieve timely and useful cooperation : adequate national capabilities and tailored international arrangements and agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral . <p> National capabilities that the littoral states must each possess include : <p> ? Ability to constantly monitor shipping in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore <p> ? Ability to receive , analyze , disseminate and act on information in real time at all hours <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement <p> ? Delegation of authority to a national operations center <p> ? Liaison officers from the littoral states present in each country 's operations center <p> ? Communications ability and protocol between operation centers <p> ? Appropriate national laws , regulations and procedures <p> ? Full implementation of the IMO 's International Ship and Port Facility Security ( ISPS ) Code to reduce risks to passengers , crews and port personnel on board ships and in port areas and to the vessels and their cargoes(n27) <p> There are a number of international agreements and regional arrangements that can form part of the legal framework for international cooperation in the straits while respecting the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the littoral States . These include : <p> ? United Nations Law of the Sea Convention , 1982 <p> ? Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation , 1988 <p> ? Regional Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia , 2004 UN Law of the Sea Convention , 1982(n28) <p> The UN Law of the Sea Convention is widely ratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Malaysia , Indonesia and Singapore are party Indeed among the ASEAN countries , only Cambodia and Thailand are not party . <p> The following rules and provisions concerning maritime law enforcement contained in the convention are widely considered to be reflective of customary inter national law accepted by the United States : <p> ? All states have the duty to cooperate in the suppression of piracy ( Article 100 ) and smuggling of drugs ( Article 108 ) <p> ? Piracy is defined in Article 101  --  but it can not occur in territorial seas <p> ? In cases of suspected piracy , shipboarding in international waters-both high seas and exclusive economic zones ( EEZ )  --  is authorized without specific flag state consent ( Article 110 ) <p> ? Right of hot pursuit is defined ( Article 111 ) : <p> * Ceases as soon as pursued ship enters the territorial sea of its own state or of a third state ( Article 111.3 ) <p> * Does not address most other crimes not amounting to piracy <p> * Does not require states to criminalize piracy under national law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent ( Article 110.1 ) SUA Convention Amendments(n29) <p> The Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation ( SUA Convention ) , 1988 , fills some jurisdictional gaps by addressing acts that endanger the safety of international navigation while the ship is underway on an international voyage . It requires parties to criminalize such acts under national law and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators . <p> There were 126 parties to the SUA Convention as of August 2005. ( n30 ) Unfortunately , only five ASEAN members are party to SUA : Brunei , Myanmar , the Philippines , Singapore and Vietnam . Other parties include Australia , China , Japan and the United States. ( n31 ) Most notably , Malaysia and Indonesia are not party to the SUA Convention . However , the Federation of ASEAN Shipowners ' Associations has recently recommended that all ASEAN countries ratify the SUA Convention and put in place the necessary national legislation to implement it. ( n32 ) <p> Nevertheless , the SUA Convention does not address modern threats of terror ism to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not identify potentially appropriate measures , such as boarding and searching a ship , to interrupt the com mission of an SUA Convention offense . <p> Terrorist threats not addressed by the original SUA Convention include : <p> ? Mining of critical ports by swimmers or small boats <p> ? Importation of WMD by container or other clandestine means <p> ? Increase in drug or migrant trafficking to fund terrorist activities <p> ? Sabotage of critical infrastructure <p> ? Sabotage or hijacking of a high-interest vessel <p> ? Use of ships and their cargoes as weapons <p> Between 2002 and 2005 , the legal committee of the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) formulated amendments to meet these new threats . A diplomatic conference , held in London from 10-14 October 2005 , considered and adopt ed the amendments. ( n33 ) <p> The amendments to the SUA Convention include offenses against the security of maritime navigation . Three new articles address the new offenses to be added to the SUA Convention . The amendments also add a shipboarding regime based on flag-state consent . This regime will provide procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the suspect ship and authorization to board the vessel and take the necessary action to prevent the commission of an SUA offense . Significantly , the amendments would provide the most extensive safeguards for seafarers contained in any multilateral agreement applicable when shipboardings occur. ( n34 ) Asian Regional Anti-Piracy Agreement ( ReCAAP ) <p> After four years of negotiation , the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia ( ReCAAP ) was adopt ed in November 2004 by 16 states : Bangladesh , Brunei , Cambodia , China , India , Indonesia , Japan , the Republic of Korea , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , the Philippines , Singapore , Sri Lanka , Thailand and Vietnam . However , the ReCAAP agreement is not yet in force. ( n35 ) <p> The agreement , a Japanese initiative , addresses both piracy and armed robbery against ships not amounting to piracy but it does not cover other criminal activity at sea . The agreement sets up mechanisms for achieving international cooperation . For example , parties may request assistance from each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 , 11 ) . The agreement specifically authorizes cooperative arrangements ( Article 15 ) and also seeks to enhance capacity building ( Article 14 ) . However , the agreement does not deal with methods of assistance or the use of force . <p> Two other efforts may provide additional inspiration for the formulation of a comprehensive cooperative mechanism among straits states : the IMO draft antipiracy cooperation agreement , and the Caribbean regional maritime counternarcotics agreement . IMO Draft Anti-Piracy Cooperation Agreement <p> In 1999 the IMO published a draft anti-piracy cooperation agreement developed internally for consideration by governments. ( n36 ) This comprehensive draft agreement provides full respect for national sovereignty of all countries while providing bases for regional cooperation . It includes provisions for maritime law enforcement in and over international and national waters . Caribbean Regional Agreement <p> The " Agreement concerning co-operation in suppressing illicit maritime and air trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in the Caribbean Area , " opened for signature on 10 April 2003 in San Jose , Costa Rica . It recognizes that because no country in the region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of drug smuggling by itself , international cooperation is essential . It provides full respect for the national sovereignty of all countries bordering the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico while providing bases for regional and sub-regional cooperation among those countries and taking into account the differing capabilities of and threats to each . It also provides for the establishment of national , sub-regional and regional capabilities for " real time  --  all the time " exchange of operational information , requests , authorizations and coordination of actions to suppress illicit traffic , while respecting exclusive flag-state and coastal-state jurisdiction . The regional trust-building that is likely to be achieved through joint action in the Caribbean might provide a lesson for straits states ' negotiations. ( n37 ) <p> Unfortunately these precedents are not sufficient in and of themselves to ensure the safety and security of navigation in the straits . EFFORTS TO ENHANCE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF NAVIGATION IN THE STRAITS International Maritime Organization <p> The IMO has been very active in other multilateral efforts to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea , as well as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the straits . It has promulgated several documents , including recommendations for governments ; ( n38 ) ship owners , ship operators , ship masters and crews ; ( n39 ) a draft code of practice for investigation of these crimes ; ( n40 ) published reports of these criminal acts ; and a comprehensive bibliography. ( n41 ) <p> The IMO has sponsored or participated in a number of international and regional conferences and events where safety of navigation and the provision and maintenance of adequate aids to navigation in the straits have been discussed . The most recent of these events was the Jakarta Meeting on the Straits of Malacca and Singapore : Enhancing Safety , Security and Environmental Protection ( Jakarta , 7-8 September 2005 ) . ( n42 ) <p> In addition , the IMO has made numerous and considerable efforts to enhance the safety of navigation and environmental protection in the straits and has provided a forum for littoral and user states to discuss various pertinent issues . These have resulted in the adoption of amendments to the existing traffic-separation schemes in the Straits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules for vessels navigating through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore ; ( n43 ) and the establishment of the mandatory ship-reporting system in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. ( n44 ) The IMO sponsors the Marine Electronic Highway ( MEH ) Project for the straits which aims to provide Electronic Navigational Charts for the straits area ; to supply of navigational information on a real-time basis , including tidal and current data ; to fit adequate Automatic Identification System ( AIS ) shore stations in the straits area ; and within the project , to operate a model MEH System involving tankers equipped with Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems ( ECDIS ) . ( n45 ) Regional Efforts <p> During recent years , various efforts have been undertaken in the region to combat piracy and armed robbery against ships , as well as to enhance maritime security in the South East Asia region and specifically in the straits. ( n46 ) <p> Japan <p> In addition to its leadership in developing ReCAAP as mentioned above , Japan Coast Guard ( JCG ) patrol vessels and aircraft have visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaboration through the exchange of information and the conduct of joint exercises among the coast guard agencies of the countries concerned ; so far JCG 's patrol vessels have visited seven countries and its aircraft have visited eight countries . For the purpose of enhancing law enforcement cooperation against transnational crimes such as piracy , JCG has been implementing several programs to assist human-resource development in both the long and short term , such as the provision of maritime law enforcement training courses and the acceptance of overseas students at the Japan Coast Guard Academy . The JCG and the Nippon Foundation have provided financial support for regular " Experts Meetings " held in Malaysia , Indonesia , the Philippines and Thailand in order to promote mutual cooperation and understanding. ( n47 ) <p> ASEAN <p> In 2003 , the tenth ASEAN Regional Forum ( ARF ) Ministerial Meeting issued a comprehensive statement on cooperation against piracy and other threats to security in the Asia-Pacific region. ( n48 ) <p> At the twelfth meeting of the ARF Ministers in July 2005 , the ministers " welcomed the ARF 's sustained efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key areas for future cooperation : multilateral cooperation , operational solutions to maritime safety and security , shipping and port security , and application of technology for maritime safety and security. ( n49 ) It remains to be seen how and to what extent cooperation in each of these four areas will be achieved . <p> Littoral States <p> Over the past 15 months , the littoral states have introduced new initiatives to enhance the security of the straits . On 24 July 2004 , the chiefs of the armed forces of Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore launched trilateral coordinated patrols of the straits , code-named MALSINDO Malacca Straits Coordinated Patrols. ( n50 ) Unfortunately the patrols appear to have had little success. ( n51 ) <p> More significantly , during a 1-2 August 2005 meeting in Kuala Lumpur , the chiefs of the defense forces of Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore and Thailand agreed on steps to enhance the security of the straits . They agreed to establish two working groups , one to draft standard operating procedures for coordinated security patrols in the straits that would now include Thailand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Malaysian proposal to enhance aerial surveillance of the straits. ( n53 ) The " eyes in the sky " patrols commenced on 13 September 2005 ; the patrols , using two aircraft from each of the four countries , are permitted to fly above the waters of the four nations no closer than 3 nautical miles from land . Each nation is to conduct up to two air patrols per week , with each flight carrying a combined mission patrol team com posed of personnel from the four participating nations. ( n54 ) <p> The foreign ministers of Malaysia , Indonesia and Singapore also met from 1-2 August 2005 in Batam , Indonesia , to discuss matters pertaining to the safety of navigation , environmental protection and maritime security in the straits . At the end of the meeting they issued the " Batam Joint Statement of the 4th Tripartite Ministerial Meeting of the Littoral States on the Straits of Malacca and Singapore . " This very important statement laid out their views on enhancing the security of the straits , as follows : 4 . The Ministers reaffirmed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straits of Malacca and Singapore , defined under UNCLOS 1982 as straits used for international navigation . As such , the primary responsibility over the safety of navigation , environmental protection and maritime security in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore lies with the littoral States . 5 . The Ministers emphasized that whatever measures undertaken in the Straits should be in accordance with international law including UNCLOS 1982 . In this regard they acknowledged the interest of user States and relevant international agencies and the role they could play in respect of the Straits . 6 . The Ministers recognized the importance of the Tripartite Ministerial Meeting on the Straits of Malacca and Singapore in providing the overall framework for cooperation . They agreed that the Ministers and the Senior Officials should meet on a more regular basis to address relevant issues in a timely manner . Such meetings may include , if necessary , representatives of other relevant agencies of the respective littoral States . 7 . The Ministers recognized the importance of engaging the states bordering the funnels leading to the Straits of Malacca and Singapore , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ministers supported continuing discussion on the overall subject of maritime security in the South East Asian region within the framework of ASEAN and the ASEAN Regional Forum ( ARF ) . 8 . The Ministers acknowledged the good work carried out by the Tripartite Technical Experts Group ( TTEG ) on Safety of Navigation in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore . They also recognized the efforts of the Revolving Fund Committee ( RFC ) in dealing with issues of environmental protection in the Straits . In this regard , the Ministers welcomed the convening of the 30th TTEG on Safety of Navigation Meeting scheduled to be held in Penang , Malaysia , in September 2005. 9 . The Ministers encouraged cooperation between littoral States and the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) to put in place the Pilot Project of Marine Electronic Highway ( MEH ) as a step forward for the enhancement of the safety of navigation and environmental protection in the Straits . The Ministers also took note of the forthcoming establishment of the ReCAAP Information Sharing Center in Singapore . In this regard the Ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cooperate with the Center . 10 . The Ministers supported the convening of the Chiefs of Defence Forces of Malaysia , Indonesia , Singapore and Thailand Informal Meeting ( CDF-MIST Informal Meeting ) in Kuala Lumpur on 1-2 August 2005 , and encouraged them to further strengthen their cooperation . 11 . The Ministers acknowledged that the littoral States should address the issue of maritime security comprehensively which includes trans-boundary crimes such as piracy , armed robbery and terrorism . The Ministers also recognized the need to address the issue of trafficking in persons , and smuggling of people , weapons and other trans-boundary crimes through appropriate mechanisms . 12 . The Ministers agreed to establish a TTEG on Maritime Security to complement the works of the existing TTEG on Safety of Navigation and the Revolving Fund Committee . 13 . Bearing in mind the responsibility and burden of littoral States and the interests of user States in maintaining the safety of navigation , environmental protection and maritime security , the Ministers welcomed the assistance of the user States , relevant international agencies , and the shipping community in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other forms of assistance in accordance with UNCLOS 1982 . In this regard they also welcomed closer collaboration between littoral States and the international community . 14 . The Ministers expressed regret at Lloyds ' categorization of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore as a high risk zone for piracy and terrorism without consulting and taking into account the existing efforts of the littoral States to deal with the problems of safety of navigation and maritime security The Ministers urged the Committee to review its risk assessment accordingly . 15 . The Ministers welcomed the forthcoming " Meeting on the Straits of Malacca and Singapore : Enhancing Safety , Security and Environmental Protection " in collaboration with the International Maritime Organization to be held on 7-8 September 2005 in Jakarta , Indonesia. ( n55 ) <p> In addition , in his state address ( the equivalent of a U.S. President 's annual State of the Union address ) of 16 August 2005 , Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono appears to have confirmed Indonesia 's intentions to welcome international cooperation in improving security in the Straits of Malacca . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the securizing sic of the Malacca Strait from various threats , in line with our responsibility as a coastal state . For that purpose , we have increased trilateral cooperation with Malaysia and Singapore , in addition to with other countries utilizing the sea-lanes in that Strait . The Government also continues to increase its capability to prevent and combat acts of terrorism . Regional and international cooperation to overcome this threat have proceeded well and will be increased further. ( n56 ) Jakarta Meeting on the Straits of Malacca and Singapore <p> The Jakarta Meeting on the Straits of Malacca and Singapore , 7-8 September 2005 , brought together representatives of 31 user states as well as the three straits states . Formal presentations were made , inter alia , by the IMO , each of the three littoral states , China , Japan , the Republic of Korea , the United States , and several non governmental organizations . While the user states who were represented all indicated their willingness to provide assistance , the littoral states failed to specify what assistance they needed . Instead they emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the near term to enhance the safety , security and environmental protection of the straits. ( n57 ) <p> Thus it is expected that the IMO will convene meetings in 2006 , most likely in Singapore and Malaysia , where the littoral states will be expected to identify and prioritize their needs and interested user states will be expected to identify possible assistance to respond to those needs. ( n58 ) CONCLUSION <p> ? Cooperation is essential <p> ? Capacity building is available <p> ?
