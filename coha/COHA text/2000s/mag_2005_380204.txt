DVDs <P> Movies are coming out on disc faster than ever . So it 's in with the old and with the new <P> FILMS THIS YEAR <P> FRANK MILLER 'S SIN CITY RECUT , EXTENDED , UNRATED <P> Dimension $39.99 <P> We have seen the future , and it 's cool . Using green screen , stars like Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke , and a style so rich and lurid it ought to be illegal , Robert Rodriguez has perfected a system that is to old-fashioned filmmaking what Grand Theft Auto is to your father 's Oldsmobile . The movie 's pretty good too : a gnarly noir nightmare in four parts , which the unrated DVD presents with added footage and a zillion natty extras . <P> THE WHITE DIAMOND <P> Wellspring $24.98 <P> Nobody has dreamed of building a better airship since the Hindenburg exploded in 1937 , but aeronautics engineer Graham Dorrington has just that obsession . That makes him an ideal subject for one of director Werner Herzog 's luminous studies of the peril that attends man 's quest to tame nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally gets the airship to fly , it 's one of the most spiritually buoyant scenes in recent cinema . <P> KUNG FU HUSTLE <P> Sony $28.95 <P> For years , Stephen Chow was famous across Asia as the bad boy of Hong Kong comedy . Who knew he was also a wildly gifted director , until this Buster Keaton  --  esque martial-arts comedy ? In old Shanghai , a gang has scared everyone off the streets  --  everyone except the harder-than-jade residents of Pig Sty Alley , who help turn a mobster wannabe ( Chow ) into a Bruce Lee gotta-be . Behind the frantic fun is a directorial eye so acute it makes most Hollywood directors seem myopic . <P> STAR WARS , EPISODE III : REVENGE OF THE SITH <P> Fox $29.98 <P> For maximum effect , this should be seen on a gigantic movie screen  --  the visual scope is that grand , the details that rich . But George Lucas ' dark and honorable wrap-up to his space odyssey will look just fine on the 45-in. screen in your home-entertainment center . The DVD has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , except How come Padm dies here , when in the original Star Wars trilogy Princess Leia remembers her mother ? <P> 2046 <P> Sony $29.95 <P> Hong Kong 's Wong Kar-wai believes two things : love hurts , and its pain can be beautiful to see . In Wong 's 2000 romance In the Mood for Love , Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai circled each other in slo-mo for an hour and a half , and their almost-touching sparked more erotic heat than a dozen Jenna Jameson epics . 2046 is a kind of sequel , with Leung languidly courting a quartet of beauties : a prostitute ( Ziyi Zhang ) , a vamp ( Carina Lau ) , a gambler ( Gong Li ) and the elfin girl of his dreams ( Faye Wong ) . That gives the director four times as many chances to let furtive glances and plaintive words collide  --  which they do , to subtly devastating effect . These days dreamy romances are hard to find , especially of the smoky , smoldering Wong Kar-wai brand . 2046 is the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Got a light ?
