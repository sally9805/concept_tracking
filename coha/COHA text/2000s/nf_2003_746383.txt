The purpose of this study was to examine factors , which influence African American physical education majors , career choice to enter the adapted physical education ( APE ) profession . Participants were 70 ( 41 males , 29 females ) African American undergraduate physical education teacher education ( PETE ) majors from 21 randomly selected historically Black colleges and universities . A mailed survey procedure was used to solicit information from participants . Data were analyzed and reported both descriptively ( e.g. , frequencies and percentages ) and inferentially ( i.e. , Chi-square analysis test of association ) across career choice ( i.e. , non-APE versus APE ) groups . In addition , thematic analysis of open-ended responses was conducted . Results suggest that professional exposure to APE was a significant factor in participants ' career choice to enter the profession . Moreover , all undergraduate physical education majors surveyed in this study expressed a need for increased representation of African American role models in the APE profession . <p> The percentage of African American university students who indicate physical education as a career choice continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ogle , Rogers , &; Smith , 1992 ; King , 1994 ) . Similarly , the number of African Americans in physical education teacher education ( PETE ) graduate programs and entering the adapted physical education ( APE ) profession is disproportionately small ( Jansma &; Webb , 1999 ) . Paradoxically , although , the proportion of children of color ( e.g. , African Americans ) served in special education ( including APE ) continues to increase , the number of teachers and related service personnel of color trained in our colleges and universities continues to decrease ( Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA , 1997 ) . For example , only 11.2% of individuals enrolled in graduate professional preparation programs for special education are African Americans ( IDEA , 1997 ) . In comparison , less than 5% of all physical education professionals are persons of color ( Smith , 1991 ) with an even smaller percentage of those persons selecting APE as a career ( Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ) . <p> Due to the underrepresentation of students of color ( e.g. , African Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists for increased representation of such individuals to ensure the diversification of graduate education programs nationwide ( Jansma &; Webb , 1999 ) . Teachers trained in APE are generally responsible for the design and implementation of individualized educational programs with particular emphasis given to physical and motor fitness ; fundamental motor skills and patterns ; and skills in aquatics , dance and individual or group games and sports designed to meet the unique physical education needs of individuals with disabilities ( Jansma &; French , 1994 ; Winnick , 2000 ) . Over the past few years there have been increasing calls for the ethnic and cultural diversification of the APE profession with specific emphasis on the recruitment and mentoring of students of color ( e.g. , African Americans ) into graduate programs ( Hodge , 1997 ; Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ; Jansma &; Webb , 1999 ) . As one means to increase the representation of such students , according to Allen ( 1992 ) and Oliver ( 1993 ) , historically Black colleges and universities ( HBCUs ) serve in a vital role in preparing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education profession . HBCUs are defined as institutions of higher education established prior to 1964 which continue to have as their principal mission the education of African American students ( Lehman , 1989 ) . <p> Furthermore , federal legislation suggest that , " efforts within special education must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities persons of color into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge , role models , and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of special education " ( IDEA , 1997 , p. 40 ) . For similar reasons recruitment efforts toward attracting and socializing African Americans into the APE profession are needed ( Jansma &; Webb , 1999 ) . To date , however , there are no data based studies addressing such a question as : What factors influence African Americans ' decisions to enter the APE profession ? In other words , it is important to determine what factors influence the occupational socialization ( i.e. , factors that influence career choice ) ( Goc Karp , Williamson , &; Shifflett , 1996 ; Lawson , 1988 ; Stroot &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession . To that end , an extensive review of the PETE and APE literature pertaining to African Americans and occupational socialization was conducted , as a result five factors were identified and examined in the current study : ( a ) personal experience with a disability ( Connolly , 1994 ) ; ( b ) early professional exposure to APE ( DePauw &; Goc Karp , 1994 ; Folsom-Meek , Nearing , Groteluschen , &; Krampf , 1999 ; Hodge &; Jansma , 1999 ; Kowalski &; Rizzo , 1996 ) ; ( c ) African American role models ( Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ; King , 1994 ; King &; Chepyator-Thompson , 1996 ) ; ( d ) awareness of graduate school and job opportunities in APE ( Crase &; Walker , 1988 ; King , 1994 ) ; and ( e ) professional development and professional organization affiliation ( Jansma &; Surburg , 1995 ; Gallemore &; Ming , 1997 ) . Occupational socialization with emphasis on anticipatory socialization variables ( Goc Karp et al. , 1996 ; Lawson , 1988 ; Stroot &; Williamson , 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theoretical Framework and Purpose ) . Personal Experience with a Disability <p> Personal experience with a disability typically has an impact on undergraduate PETE majors ' decision to work with individuals with disabilities as their future career choice , particularly in those cases where the personal experience is perceived by the undergraduate PETE major as positive ( e.g. , meaningful , pleasant ) . The socialization of undergraduate PETE majors with individuals with disabilities as a means to attract them into the APE profession , may occur under multiple conditions . For instance , undergraduate PETE majors themselves could have a disability , someone " close " to them ( e.g. , a friend or a family member ) could have a disability , or undergraduate PETE majors ' interaction with individuals with disabilities via practica experiences could influence career choice into the APE profession ( Connolly , 1994 ) . <p> Much research has been conducted regarding the effects of APE course work and practicum experiences involving interaction between undergraduate PETE majors and individuals with disabilities , the extant literature suggest that favorable direct contact conditions promote favorable attitudes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al. , 1999 ; Hodge &; Jansma , 1999 ; Patrick , 1987 ; Rizzo &; Kirkendall , 1995 ; Rizzo &; Vispoel , 1992 ; Rowe &; Stutts , 1987 ; Stewart , 1990 ) . Furthermore , it is reasonable to suggest that opportunities to socialize on a personal level with someone with a disability impacts one 's attitudes toward such an individual ( Allport , 1954 ; Connolly , 1994 ) . For example , writing in her/his reflective journal , an undergraduate PETE major stated , " My best friend 's father is blind , and I feel very comfortable with him " ( Connolly , 1994 , p. 314 ) . Connolly ( 1994 ) found that participants ' previous personal experiences and direct contact opportunities ( practicum experiences involving individuals with disabilities ) had a favorable impact on undergraduate PETE majors ' attitudes toward teaching students with disabilities . Early Professional Exposure to APE <p> It is also reasonable to suggest that providing undergraduate PETE majors with early professional exposure to APE , which involves opportunities for them to interact with individuals with disabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for socializing them into the APE profession . The extant literature suggest that APE course work and practicum experience training provides opportunities for PETE majors to interact and demonstrate their use of effective pedagogical strategies for teaching individuals with disabilities ( DePauw &; Goc Karp , 1994 ; Hodge &; Jansma , 1999 ; Rizzo &; Vispoel , 1992 ; Rowe &; Stutts , 1987 ; Stewart , 1990 ) . Such professional exposure also provides undergraduate PETE majors with an opportunity to decide if they want to enter the APE profession as a career choice . <p> The National Consortium for Physical Education and Recreation for Individuals with Disabilities ( NCPERID ) has placed emphasis on undergraduate APE courses being accompanied with practica experiences which involves PETE majors working ( i.e. , interacting ) with or having early professional preparation exposure to individuals with mild to severe disabilities , across varied teaching contexts ( NCPERID , 1995 ) . NCPERID ( 1995 ) recommends that undergraduate PETE majors matriculate in at least two APE courses as a means to enhance their ability to be pedagogically effective in integrated physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators have expressed similar advocacy that PETE majors should engage in professional preparation that includes exposure to individuals with disabilities via practica experiences ( Connolly , 1994 ; Folsom-Meek et al. , 1999 ; Hodge &; Jansma , 1999 ; Kowalski &; Rizzo , 1996 ; Patrick , 1987 ; Rizzo &; Kirkendall , 1995 ; Rowe &; Stutts , 1987 ; Stewart , 1990 ) . African American Role Models <p> Undergraduate PETE majors may also be influenced by the presence or absence of ethnic and cultural roles models in terms of career choice into the APE profession ( Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ) . According to Stroot and Williamson ( 1993 ) , the physical education literature reveals that sport coaches and physical education teachers are influential role models in the recruitment of prospective physical education teachers . Yet , the underrepresentation of African American faculty within many predominantly White institutions of higher education restricts undergraduate PETE majors opportunities for exposure to and socialization with such role models ( Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ; Jansma &; Webb , 1999 ; King , 1994 ; King &; Chepyator-Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faculty diversity in higher education , Scott ( 1993 ) found that of the 139 PETE departments examined , there were only 39 tenured or tenured-track faculty members who were African American . Hodge and Stroot ( 1997 ) reported that the underrepresentation of role models from ethnic and culturally diverse backgrounds was viewed by current and former African American PETE graduate students as a barrier to success in graduate school . To which , Jansma and Webb ( 1999 ) suggested that with an increase in the number of African American faculty in PETE graduate programs who serve as role models , African American undergraduate PETE majors might began to express an interest in the APE profession as a tenable career choice . <p> Cooper ( 1988 ) acknowledged that the presence of African American educators/teachers ( serving as cultural role models ) significantly influenced ( both socially and academically ) the lives and career choice of African American educators/teachers . According to Bandura ( 1969 ) , Bandura and Walters ( 1977 ) , and more recently Hodge and Stroot ( 1997 ) , individuals are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit ways of life ( e.g. , cultural traditions ) similar to themselves . In contrast , however , where PETE majors are not exposed to or have opportunities to interact , receive instruction and guidance , and mentoring from African American faculty , imitation of such models is restricted ( Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ) . Awareness of Graduate School and Job Opportunities in APE <p> Historically speaking , graduate programs have done little to tailor their recruitment efforts as a means to attract students of color ( Crase &; Walker , 1988 ; King , 1994 ) . King ( 1994 ) noted that many PETE graduate programs do not go beyond the legal phrase " equal opportunity institution , " on their brochures as a means to attract graduate students of color . Clearly , such advertisements do not represent aggressive recruitment efforts , nor do much to make African American undergraduate PETE majors aware of important information regarding matriculation in graduate programs ( e.g. , availability of graduate associateships , tuition and fees waivers , loans , stipends , and other funding possibilities , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is reasonable to suggest that unless African American undergraduate PETE majors are made aware of graduate school opportunities in APE , they will continue to be underrepresented in the profession . To this concern , King ( 1994 ) suggest that graduate school recruitment materials ( which place emphasis on the recruitment of students of color ) should be developed and disseminated to HBCUs ( to be posted around their campuses ) as well as published in national publications ( e.g. , Black Issues in Higher Education , Journal of Blacks in Higher Education , and Essence magazine ) , which primarily attract an African American readership . <p> Job opportunities in APE have grown over the past few years ( Zhang , Joseph , &; Horvat , 1999 ) , concurrently there is a call for an increased representation of teachers of color ( e.g. , African Americans ) in special education ( IDEA , 1997 ) , physical education , and APE ( Hodge , 1997 ; Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ) . Zhang et al . ( 1999 ) suggest that even if students do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least consider choosing APE as a minor . However , if such a need is not made known ( via APE postings around university campuses and the dissemination APE related materials ) to undergraduate PETE majors , then such individuals may not know that there are growing career opportunities available in the profession of APE . Professional Development and Professional Organization Affiliation <p> Opportunities for professional development and affiliation with professional organizations are important factors to consider in terms of the occupational socialization of PETE majors into the APE profession ( Jansma &; Surburg , 1995 ; Gallemore &; Ming , 1997 ) . According to Jansma and Surburg ( 1995 ) , APE standards and competencies should be used to facilitate preservice and inservice physical education teachers ' professional development . This is a vital component of such teachers ' professional development , because with the implementation of the Adapted Physical Education National Standards ( APENS ) ( Kelly , 1993 ) , physical education teachers must possess a certain degree of competency as it relates to their ability to practice effective pedagogy with students with disabilities . Such competencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession of APE , but it also impacts the professional development and matriculation of PETE majors across U.S. colleges and universities ( Jansma &; Surburg , 1995 ) . <p> For purposes of the current study , a review of the extant APE literature revealed a lack of data based studies pertaining to African Americans ' professional involvement in affiliated professional organizations such as NCPERID or the Adapted Physical Activity Council ( APAC ) . However , Gallemore and Ming ( 1997 ) examined inservice general physical educators ' perceptions of barriers to their professional involvement . They reported that there were three factors which hampered such individuals ' professional involvement in professional organizations : ( a ) school atmosphere , ( b ) information , and ( c ) conference and membership . School atmosphere concerned the degree of support physical educators received from their administrators and peers , and the physical educators ' commitment to be professionally involved . According to Gallemore and Ming ( 1997 ) , information pertained to the dissemination of information to physical educators from their professional organizations , and conference and membership pertained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliation . It is reasonable to suggest that Gallemore and Ming 's ( 1997 ) findings have relevance to the professional development of PETE majors ( e.g. , conference and membership variables ) . <p> With regard to conference and membership in APE professional organizations ( e.g. , NCPERID , APAC ) , the visible representation of African American professionals in attendance at state , regional , and national conferences as well as at APE professional meetings is disproportionately small compared to White American professionals . Although , it is not empirically known as to what factors contribute to the shortage of African American members in attendance at such conferences and meetings , it is logical to suggest that the underrepresentation of African Americans is at least partly reflective of the small percentage of African Americans who are socialized into the physical education profession ( Asalam et al. , 1992 ; King , 1994 ) . Theoretical Framework and Purpose <p> According to Goc Karp et al . ( 1996 ) , Lawson ( 1988 ) , and Stroot and Williamson ( 1993 ) , occupational socialization in the PETE literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kinds of socialization that initially <p> influence individuals to enter the physical education profession and that contribute to their perceptions and actions as teacher educators and practicing teachers . In brief , within the PETE occupational socialization literature three phases have been identified : ( a ) anticipatory socialization , which involves career choice ; ( b ) professional socialization , which includes recruitment into the physical education profession , and ( c ) organizational socialization , which consists of learning and deciphering the expectations required by the work organization ( Goc Karp et al. , 1996 ; Lawson , 1988 ; Stroot &; Williamson , 1993 ) . In the current study , we sought to provide insight regarding factors influencing the socialization of African American undergraduate PETE majors into the APE profession ; in doing so , the theoretical framework used for this study was occupational socialization with particular emphasis on anticipatory socialization variables . The process of anticipatory socialization concerns factors contributing to the process of selecting a career ( Goc Karp et al. , 1996 , Hutchinson , 1993 ; Lawson , 1988 , Stroot &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individuals give meaning to people , experiences , and beliefs about teaching that serve to both attract and to facilitate them toward careers in teaching ( Hutchinson , 1993 ) . Hutchinson ( 1993 ) described attractors as those perceptions that individuals find meaningful and appealing . " Facilitators are those significant people and experiences that influence individuals to seriously consider careers in teaching physical education " ( Hutchinson , 1993 , p. 345 ) . According to Hodge and Stroot ( 1997 ) , factors that influence socialization into a profession are important to consider in understanding teachers ' experiences and their career choice . The purpose of the present study was to examine factors , which influence African American undergraduate PETE majors ' career choice to enter the APE profession . Occupational socialization ( with emphasis on anticipatory socialization ) framed our study of factors appearing in the extant PETE and APE literature as potentially influential to African American undergraduate PETE majors ' career choice . A second intent was to determine if there were differences between participants who indicated APE versus those who did not indicate APE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Method Participants/Sites <p> Seventy ( 41 males , 29 females ) African American undergraduate PETE majors from 21 randomly selected historically Black colleges and universities ( HBCUs ) volunteered to participate in the study . The criteria for inclusion in this study were : participants must be identified as African American undergraduate PETE majors attending HBCUs . Participants ranged from 18-27 years of age , with a mean age of 23.3 3 years . Specifically , fifteen ( 21% ) participants ranged from 18-21 years of age , 46 ( 66% ) participants were between 22-25 years of age , and 9 ( 15% ) participants were 26 years of age and over . Instrumentation <p> For purposes of this study , data were collected using survey questionnaires , which were developed , designed , and content validated specifically for this research . Face and content validity of the questionnaires , was established using a three member panel of experts ( two experts in APE and one expert in sociology ) , who reviewed the questionnaires in terms of representativeness , completeness and accuracy , appropriateness and suitability , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' written feedback indicated that the questionnaires were content valid and deemed appropriate for use in the current study . It is important to note that prior to principle study data collection , a pilot study was conducted on a sample population to further establish and refine the questionnaires for the target population . After piloting , we made revisions , edits , and modifications to the questionnaires for the current study . However , reliability measures were not obtained on the questionnaires . <p> The principle study questionnaires were comprised of 12 and 13 items respectively , across Sections " A " and " B , " which consisted of both a dichotomous ( i.e. , yes/no ) and an open-ended questioning format to gather information on participants ' career choices ( i.e. , not selecting APE as a career choice NAPE or selecting APE as a career choice APE ) and related factors . Questionnaires were color coded ( i.e. , Pink or Blue ) and divided ( by color ) into two sections ( i.e. , " A " and " B " ) , and each section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were contingent upon participants ' initial response of not having chose APE as a career choice ( NAPE ) , or having chose APE as a career choice . Specifically , Section A ( Pink ) was completed by participants ( NAPE ) who did not consider APE as a career choice , and Section B ( Blue ) was completed by participants ( APE ) who considered APE as a career choice . Data Collection and Analysis <p> For data collection purposes , contact letters , which described the purpose of the study were mailed to PETE department chairpersons at 30 randomly selected HBCUs . In addition , these contact letters also requested department chairpersons ' participation in the study ( as data collectors ) and explained their potential roles . As a means to assist department chairpersons with collecting data on the questionnaires and to ensure data collection consistency , an administration protocol accompanied the mailed questionnaires . However , department chairpersons and PETE faculty members were not specifically trained as it relates to administering the questionnaires . <p> A follow-up ( approximately 7-10 days after the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further explain the study , respond to any questions in which department chairpersons may have had , and to confirm agreement that they would assist in the study by distributing survey questionnaires and administration protocols to their PETE faculty members ( Salant &; Dillman , 1994 ) . In turn , PETE faculty asked undergraduate PETE majors enrolled in their physical education method classes to voluntarily respond to items on the questionnaires . To increase the return rate of the questionnaires , all mailings were accompanied with a stamped , self-addressed return envelope ( Salant &; Dillman , 1994 ) . Participants ' anonymity was maintained as no means of identifying these participants was required on the questionnaires . <p> Data were analyzed and reported descriptively ( e.g. , frequencies and percentages ) and inferentially with Chi-square analysis test of association ( Statistical Package of Social Science SPSS , 1998 ) . Significance was set at the .05 alpha level ( Gravetter &; Wallnau , 1996 ) . In addition , common themes were gleaned from the open-ended questionnaire items ( Patton , 1990 ) . Results Career Choice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 ( 70% ) returned completed questionnaires from their undergraduate PETE majors totaling 70 participants ( Table 1 ) . Of the 70 undergraduate PETE majors completing the questionnaires , 39 ( 56% ) did not choose APE as a career choice ( NAPE group ) , and 31 ( 44% ) chose APE as a career choice ( APE group ) . With regard to gender status , 41 ( 59% ) participants were male and 29 ( 41% ) were female undergraduate PETE majors . Of the 41 male participants , 22 ( 54% ) did not choose APE as a career choice , whereas 19 ( 46% ) chose APE as a career choice . Of the 29 female participants , 17 ( 59% ) did not choose APE ( i.e. , NAPE ) as a career choice , and 12 ( 41% ) chose APE as a career choice . Non-Adapted Physical Education ( NAPE ) Participants ' Responses Across Factors ( Table 2 ) <p> Factor 1 : Personal Experience with a Disability . Of the 39 NAPE participants 13 ( 33% ) reportedly had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a disability ( Table 2 ) . Moreover , 5 ( 13% ) NAPE participants reported that someone close to them had a disability , whereas 34 ( 87% ) reportedly did not have anyone close to them with a disability . <p> Factor 2 : Professional Exposure to APE . In terms of undergraduate professional training ( via a practicum experience ) involving individuals with disabilities , of the 39 NAPE participants , only 2 ( 5% ) reportedly had such an experience , and 37 ( 95% ) did not have such an experience . In terms of the number of courses taken in APE , 23 ( 59% ) of the NAPE participants reportedly had taken none , 11 ( 29% ) had taken one course , and 5 ( 12% ) had taken two courses . <p> Factor 3 : African American Role Models . Of the 39 NAPE participants , all 39 ( 100% ) responded yes to the need for an increased representation of African Americans in the APE profession . With regard to them knowing other African Americans in the profession of APE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , and 29 ( 74% ) responded no Also 14 ( 36% ) of the NAPE participants viewed teaching as a worthwhile career choice for African Americans , whereas 25 ( 64% ) did not perceive teaching to be viewed as such . <p> Factor 4 : Awareness of Graduate School and Job Opportunities . On campus advertisements pertaining to APE graduate school opportunities , 9 ( 23% ) of the NAPE participants reported that there were such advertisements on their campuses , whereas 30 ( 77% ) reported that there were no such advertisements on their campuses . In terms of campus advertisements pertaining to APE job opportunities , 14 ( 36% ) NAPE participants reported that there were such advertisements on their campuses , and 25 ( 64% ) reported that there were no such advertisements on their campuses . Relative to perceiving APE as a growing profession , 11 ( 28% ) of the NAPE participants perceived it as such , and 28 ( 72% ) reportedly did not perceive APE as a growing profession . <p> Factor 5 : Professional Development and Professional Organization Affiliation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of a professional organization within their major , whereas 18 ( 46% ) NAPE participants reported that they were not members . <p> Furthermore , 5 ( 13% ) NAPE participants reported that they had attended professional conferences aligned with their major area of study , whereas 34 ( 87% ) reportedly did not attend such conferences . Adapted Physical Education ( APE ) Participants ' Responses Across Factors ( Table 3 ) <p> Factor 1 : Personal Experience with a Disability . Of the 31 participants who chose APE as a career choice , 14 ( 45% ) APE participants responded yes to having a disability , whereas 17 ( 55% ) APE participants reportedly did not have a disability ( Table 3 ) . Twenty-six ( 84% ) of the APE participants reportedly had someone close to them who had a disability , and 5 ( 16% ) APE participants reportedly did not have someone close to them with a disability . <p> Factor 2 : Professional Exposure to APE . In terms of exposure to individuals with disabilities as part of their professional training ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants reportedly had had such an experience , whereas 10 ( 30% ) APE participants reported they did not have such an experience . Regarding the number of courses taken in APE , 7 ( 23% ) APE participants reportedly had not take any APE courses , 9 ( 30% ) APE participants reportedly had taken one APE course , and 15 ( 47% ) APE participants had taken two APE courses . <p> Factor 3 : African American Role Models . With respect to APE participants ' socialization into APE as a result of influence from role models , 15 ( 48% ) APE participants reported that they were influenced by an African American role model , and 16 ( 52% ) APE participants reported that they were not influenced to consider APE by such a person . All 31(100%) of the APE participants felt that there was a need for an increased representation of African Americans in the APE profession . In response to knowing African Americans in the APE profession , 20(65%) APE participants responded yes , whereas 11(35%) of these participants responded no to this inquiry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for African Americans , 22(71%) APE participants responded yes and 9(29%) APE participants responded no . <p> Factor 4 : Awareness of Graduate School and Job Opportunities . Eight ( 26% ) APE participants reported that there were advertisements on their campuses pertaining to graduate school opportunities in APE , whereas 23 ( 74% ) APE participants reported that such advertisements were not visible on their campuses . Eight ( 26% ) APE participants reported that there were advertisements on their campuses relative to job opportunities in APE , and 23 ( 74% ) APE participants reported that no such advertisements were posted on their campuses . Lastly , 20 ( 65% ) APE participants perceived APE as a growing profession , whereas 11 ( 35% ) APE participants did not perceive APE as a growing profession . <p> Factor 5 : Professional Development and Professional Organization Affiliation . In terms of professional organization membership within their major , 18 ( 58% ) APE participants reported that they were members , whereas 13 ( 42% ) APE participants reportedly were not members of a professional organization within their major . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences in their major , whereas 13 ( 42% ) APE participants reportedly did not attend such conferences . Chi-Square Analysis of Factors Across Career Choice ( Table 4 ) <p> For Factor 1 , of the participants ( n=39 ) who did not choose APE as a career choice ( NAPE ) , 18 ( 46% ) of them indicated that they had had a personal experience with a disability . Of the participants ( n=31 ) who considered APE as a career choice , 14 ( 45% ) of them indicated that they had had a personal experience with a disability . Chi-square analysis test of association on this factor revealed no significant differences , Xsu ( 1 , n=70 ) = .024 , p&gt;.05 , between the NAPE and APE groups ( Table 4 ) . <p> Specific to Factor 2 , of the participants ( n=39 ) who did not choose APE as a career choice , 21 ( 54% ) of these participants indicated that they had had professional exposure to APE during their undergraduate training . Of the 31 participants who chose APE as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had had professional exposure to APE . Chi-square analysis test of association on this factor indicated that there were significant differences , Xsu ( 1 , n=70 ) =4.038 , p&lt;.05 , between the NAPE and APE groups ( Table 4 ) . <p> For Factor 3 , all 70 ( 100% ) participants regardless of career choice ( NAPE or APE ) indicated that they perceived a need for increased representation of African American role models in the APE profession . Because all 70 undergraduate PETE majors surveyed responded in the affirmative to perceiving a need for greater African American representation in the APE profession , Chi-square analysis test of association was not conducted on this factor . <p> Results specific to Factor 4 , revealed that of the participants ( n=39 ) who did not choose APE as a career choice , 23 ( 59% ) reported that they were aware of graduate school and job opportunities in APE . Of the 31 participants who chose APE as a career choice , 17 reportedly were aware of graduate school and job opportunities in APE . Chi-square analysis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 , n = 70 ) = .237 , p&gt;.05 , between the NAPE and APE groups ( Table 4 ) . <p> For Factor 5 , of the 39 participants who did not choose APE as a career choice , 21(54%) of them reported involvement in professional development and professional organizations . Specific to the 31 participants who chose APE as a career choice , 18 ( 58% ) of them reportedly had involvement in professional development and professional organizations . Chi-square analysis test of association on this factor indicated that there were no significant differences , X ( 1 , n=70 ) =.234 , p&gt;.05 , between career choice groups ( Table 4 ) . Common Themes Emerged <p> Of the 39 participants who did not choose APE as a career choice , thematic analysis of the open-ended probes from the questionnaire revealed the emergence of two themes : ( a ) these participants did not have an interest in APE , and ( b ) they had no professional preparation in the area of APE . For example , one NAPE participant stated , " I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major area of study . " Another NAPE participant stated , " I did not have enough courses in that area that really made me interested in choosing it as a major . " <p> Two different themes emerged from the thematic analysis with regard to the 31 participants who chose APE as a career choice . These themes were : ( a ) they enjoyed working with individuals with disabilities , and ( b ) they had had satisfying practica experiences with individuals with disabilities . For example , one APE participant stated , " I have always liked working with individuals with disabilities , because it is rewarding to me . " On satisfying practica experiences , another APE participant stated " My major advisor provided me with a positive experience , which allowed me an opportunity to work with individuals with disabilities . " Summary and Recommendations <p> The purpose of this study was to examine factors , which influence African American undergraduate PETE majors ' career choice to enter the APE profession . Guided by occupational socialization theoretical framework ( Goc Karp et al. , 1996 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the current study represents an initial effort to examine factors that could influence African American undergraduate PETE majors at HBCUs to enter the APE profession . An important findings in this study was that , undergraduate PETE majors who had had professional exposure to APE in which they had an opportunity to interact with persons with disabilities via their practica experiences and/or had taken more than one APE course were more prone to consider APE as a career choice than their peers with no similar professional exposure . This finding supports the notion of anticipatory socialization ( Goc Karp et al. , Hutchinson , 1993 ; Lawson , 1988 ; Stroot &; Williamson , 1993 ) , in that , most PETE majors who selected APE as a career choice had developed beliefs about the APE profession as a result of APE course work , exposure and interaction with individuals with disabilities within teaching contexts ( i.e. , practicum experiences ) . This finding is also consistent with previous research suggesting that APE course work and practicum training helps to socialize undergraduate PETE majors toward teaching students with disabilities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodge &; Jansma , 1999 ; Kowalski &; Rizzo , 1996 ; Patrick , 1987 ; Rizzo &; Vispoel , 1992 ; Rowe &; Stutts , 1987 ; Stewart , 1990 ) . <p> Furthermore , it is reasonable to suggest that professional exposure to APE , allowed the undergraduate PETE majors ( who selected APE as a career choice ) in the current study to accept the social values and practices ( e.g. , accepting individual differences , modifying tasks to accommodate individual differences ) that are important to the APE profession ( Sherrill , 1998 ) . In terms of occupational socialization , it appears that those undergraduate PETE majors who were exposed to individuals with disabilities in teaching contexts ( i.e. , practicum experiences ) , learned and developed an understanding and acceptance of norms specific to the APE profession . <p> Another important finding in the current study was that all of the undergraduate PETE majors surveyed ( whether or not they selected APE as a career choice ) viewed the underrepresentation of African American professionals as problematic and as a restriction to their opportunities for exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these undergraduate PETE majors agreed that a need exists to recruit , expose , and socialize more African American and other persons of color into the APE profession ( Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ; Jansma &; Webb , 1999 ; King , 1994 ; King &; Chepyator-Thompson , 1996 ; Scott , 1993 ) . <p> The remaining three factors examined in this study ( i.e. , Personal Experience with a Disability , Awareness of Graduate School and Job Opportunities , and Professional Development and Professional Organization Affiliation ) , did not distinguish the career choice groups ( i.e. , undergraduate PETE majors who selected APE versus those who did not select APE as a career choice ) as influential factors in their decision to select or not select APE as a career choice . More research ought to be conducted in this area with a larger sampling of undergraduate PETE majors to determine whether or not such factors influence their career choice . <p> In sum , it appears that from both a theoretical and practical perspective African American undergraduate PETE majors at HBCUs can be socialized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses and satisfying practicum experiences teaching individuals with disabilities in physical activity contexts . This finding is consistent with the extant APE literature in this area ( Connolly , 1994 ; Folsom-Meek et al. , 1999 ; Hodge &; Jansma , 1999 ; Patrick , 1987 ; Rizzo &; Kirkendall , 1995 ; Rizzo &; Vispoel , 1992 ; Rowe &; Stutts , 1987 ; Stewart , 1990 ) and supports the notion of anticipatory socialization into physical education ( Goc Karp et al. , 1996 ; Hutchinson , 1993 ; Lawson , 1988 ; Stroot &; Williamson , 1993 ) . This suggests that practicum experience training and course work that emphasize teaching individuals with disabilities is influential in the socialization of African American undergraduate PETE majors into the APE profession . Importantly , a call for increased representation of African American adapted physical education professionals was also expressed by the undergraduate PETE majors surveyed in the current study , regardless of their career choice . We already know that coaches and physical education teachers can be influential role models in prospective physical education teachers ' career choice to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . However , it has yet to be determined if African American faculty can influence undergraduate PETE majors ' career choice into the APE profession . This highlights the need to find creative ways to increase the proportion of African American and other ethnic and culturally diverse graduate students ( e.g. , Asian , American/Pacific Islander , Hispanic , Native American ) to expose , prepare , and socialize them into the APE profession ( Hodge , 1997 ; Hodge &; Stroot , 1997 ; Jansma &; Webb , 1999 ) . Limitations <p> The importance of the current study is recognized , in that we examined factors influencing African American undergraduate PETE majors ' career choice . This is an area of inquiry that had not yet been examined . In the conduct of this study , we were guided by the occupational socialization theoretical framework ( Goc Karp et al. , 1996 ; Lawson , 1988 ; Stroot &; Williamson , 1993 ) , however , this study does have limitations . First , of the 30 randomly selected HBCUs , only 21 ( 70% ) of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totaling 70 participants . Thus , the generalizability of our findings is limited . Future studies ought to include a larger sample size ( Gravetter &; Wallnau , 1996 ) . Secondly , data in this study revealed that undergraduate PETE majors who did not select APE as a career choice had limited or no professional exposure to APE teaching contexts , these data do not indicate whether the lack of such preliminary exposure was due to the choice of the participants or if this type of exposure was absent in the participants ' current professional preparation programs . However , it should be noted that at the time this study was conducted , only fourteen states required certification in APE , therefore , from a professional preparation perspective , a number of the HBCUs in this study may not have seen the need to offer more than one undergraduate APE course ( French , Jansma , &; Winnick , 1978 ; Hodge &; Jansma , 1999 ; Rizzo &; Kirkendall , 1995 ) . <p> To counter limitations noted in this study , several strategies were used : ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) both females and males were surveyed , and ( c ) a homogenous group ( i.e. , only African American undergraduate PETE majors at HBCUs ) was studied . Additional research should be conducted to examine additional factors that influence undergraduate PETE majors to consider APE as a career choice , PREFORMATTED TABLE PREFORMATTED TABLE PREFORMATTED TABLE PREFORMATTED TABLE <p>
