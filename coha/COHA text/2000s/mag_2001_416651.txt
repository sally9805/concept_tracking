" I watched the show like anybody else , " says Mayron , 48 , now a successful film and TV director ( The Babysitter 's Club , Dawson 's Creek ) . She even hosted a cast viewing party at her home for the episode in which Peter Horton 's Gary was killed . " We all got along so well , " she says .

" We 've grown up in a lot of ways , " says Olin . " You get over yourself in your 40s . " Yet Olin defends the self-involvement that characterized thirtysomething . " It was of a time when self-investigation was paramount , " he says . " There was nothing on television that was as personal . " Maybe so , but the couple 's teenagers are hardly impressed .
