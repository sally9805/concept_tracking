David Letterman used to do a segment on his show called " Brush with Greatness , " in which an audience member recalled a fleeting encounter with a famous person  --  say , bumping into Joan Rivers on an elevator . American Son ( Henry Holt &; Co. ; 294 pages ) , the much anticipated memoir of John F. Kennedy Jr. , by Richard Blow , feels a little like an extended literary version of this , as Blow unearths every last encounter with his subject , as if to say , I knew him ; I really , really did . <P> Blow , the former executive editor of Kennedy 's magazine , George , made headlines even before the book was written : his original publisher canceled Blow 's contract on the grounds that he had signed a confidentiality agreement with Kennedy . In response to criticism , Blow protested that his book was an appreciation , not a tell-all , and indeed , American Son is so determined to avoid being a cheesy tell-all that it does n't tell much of anything . Blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is readable if slight  --  which may have something to do with its subject , a graceful young man still in search of himself . <P> The most interesting stuff is the evidence of Kennedy 's ambivalence about becoming a member of the media he so deeply mistrusted . Blow describes how Kennedy agonized before conducting his monthly interviews and thoroughly despised negative stories about public figures  --  particularly if they shared his surname . According to Blow , Kennedy was obsessed with tabloid stories about himself but laughed off the ones that were wildly off base . He was sympathetic to a President  --  Bill Clinton  --  who he felt was being lambasted for his private life , and unsympathetic to Clinton 's wife , who he believed was exploiting her perch as First Lady to run for office . All in all , this does n't feel like a dishonest book ( as some will charge ) so much as it feels like an ever-so-carefully calculated one .  --  By Richard Stengel                  @ @ @
