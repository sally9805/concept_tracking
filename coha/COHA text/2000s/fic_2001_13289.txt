Peri , William and Frennie are on the front porch . TiToMo , Neville , and Reep are in the cemetery , joy shooting into the air with their pistols . It is afternoon . FRENNIE It sounds like thunder  --  PERI It 's TiTo and his friends shooting off their guns in the cemetery . The sound of another pistol . Frennie covers her ears . Peri holds her . FRENNIE Once in the barnyard , the lightning came into the chicken house when we were at Aunt Julia 's . Remember , Peri  --  it rolled along the perch . The hens laid eggs for days . Angels came to the chicken yard and blessed us when we stayed at Aunt Julia 's . PERI Frennie  --  you should be home  --  I thought Mom was at your place . FRENNIE I left after she did . PERI You 're going to lose another husband . FRENNIE He went to the reservoir . WILLIAM Frennie lives too near that chicken farm . Her husband should be looking for another house . FRENNIE I wanted to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house anymore . It belongs to Peri and TiTo . Aunt Julia is in the cemetery . PERI So is my husband . WILLIAM But TiTo will be back . The sound of another pistol . PERI You think so ? ( Frennie holds her hands to her ears again . ) It 's all right , Frennie . The guys are just cutting loose . Maybe TiTo is still getting over his mother 's death . ( Peri holds Frennie . ) Frennie could have laid eggs after she thought the lightning rolled into the chicken house . FRENNIE Chickens are the angels of the world , Peri . Chickens are pure and white . Remember the hen we chased to death ? Frennie leans against Peri , still holding her ears . @x William , Peri , and Frennie are on the porch . TiToMo , Neville , and Reep have returned from the cemetery and are on the steps of the porch and in the yard . REEP How can you live down here at the end of the road  --  catercorner to a graveyard , TiTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aunt . Peri and Frennie liked to come here when they were girls . I wanted the house too  --  my parents were always moving  --  my father was stationed in the east . No , the cemetery does n't bother me  --  the stones are like grazing sheep  --  WILLIAM Just like being without our jobs do n't bother us . Laborers without labor on Labor Day . NEVILLE Those stones look like tepees to me . WILLIAM Whatever gets into your head  --  TITOMO Look at William there with my wife . Let 's go back to the cemetery  --  take him joy shooting  --  NEVILLE Whatever gets into your head you ca n't get out  --  PERI If the sheriff sees you with those guns  --  TITOMO He 's at the reservoir today . They 're all out there fishing . p. 6 REEP I saw Frennie 's husband go by with his rods in his truck . PERI TiTo , you 'll hurt someone . NEVILLE Probably himself . TITOMO I 'll just shoot the stars up there  --  PERI They are n't out yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see them . REEP Wait till you ca n't make payments on your house  --  you 'll be traveling again . PERI I do n't understand why we have to make house payments . This house belonged to my Aunt Julia . TITOMO The bank owns the house , Peri . Your father sold the house to pay Aunt Julia 's bills . She was sick a long time . Then there was her funeral . Now the bank owns the house , and we make monthly payments to the bank . REEP Sounds easy to understand  --  PERI What have you ever owned that you know about buying anything ? REEP My car . My bike  --  nearly . Peri 's always got her knife and fork in . TITOMO Reep is n't over being married to Frennie. p. 7 REEP Yeah  --  all six months it lasted . NEVILLE Frennie 's Aunt Julia tried to evangelize him  --  PERI Maybe I 'm not over being married to you , Ti  --  WILLIAM It was all those chicken feathers in his way  --  REEP Think I 'll shoot me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ti , our words just miss  --  TITOMO I hear everything you say . REEP How you doing , ole Chicken Baby ? Buck . Buck . I heard you dressed like a chicken and protested the chicken farm . PERI Frennie can hear that chicken farm all day  --  we ought to get her out of there . What 's wrong with her husband ? WILLIAM  --  especially when it 's hot  --  those chickens make noise  --  I can smell that chicken farm across town . REEP Hey , Chicken Baby  --  I heard you wear a cross on your back  --  you walk with your arms tied to the cross beam  --  you seen her , Neville ? FRENNIE I thought you were looking for Floral Jean in her Falcon . p. 8 PERI Just like the cat down the road looks at me all day through the kitchen window . We used to stare at people  --  my friend , Ocholee , and me . We 'd pick out an old woman in a drugstore while we drank cokes . Ocholee was good at unraveling people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave her on a dirt road outside of Anadarko to see if she could find her way back . I remember when she 'd do something he did n't like , and he 'd drag her to the car , and soon he 'd come back alone . He was in the state hospital for a while . Jail , too , it seems . I think the neighbors complained . Mother said someone ought to . No one had the nerve to do it right out . Finally someone must have called the police . NEVILLE Ocholee is gone . The land would get up and walk away , too , if it could . WILLIAM The land 's not going anywhere . It 's still here under us . NEVILLE Everything has been migrating away from us . We just do n't know it yet . REEP Neville still thinks about Ocholee , too . WILLIAM He could n't get close to her . Her old man put the terror of men into her . REEP I tried after Neville . TITOMO I think one 's of Peri 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . I never told anyone I did . PERI But it did n't keep her from disappearing . FRENNIE Maybe she 'll show up . PERI She 's gone , Frennie . I 've been wanting to read your mother 's recipes , TiTo . I could open those boxes in the shed . TITOMO Why do n't you cook ? PERI I 've already fed your friends . Now they 're at the reservoir or the Anadarko Pow Wow . Besides , I work at Neville 's Cafe tomorrow . REEP Yahoo ! Fritters and homemade pies . PERI I 've thought about starting my own cafe  --  I even thought of a delivery service . TITOMO You 've got people enough coming here  --  WILLIAM I 'd deliver for you , Peri  --  TITOMO We always got someone here to eat or sleep . Where are your brothers ? REEP Even those dead folks over there , smelling your cooking , might just get up and walk over here . FRENNIE Or one of us might join them . p. 10 PERI There are enough of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocholee is in a graveyard somewhere  --  now Ti 's mother  --  TITOMO I do n't want you getting in her boxes yet . REEP What could opening a few boxes hurt ? PERI Your brother does n't want them . He sent them to you . They 're just some of your mother 's old things . There might be some recipes . NEVILLE Let her open the boxes , man . TITOMO I 'm ready for another beer . PERI I hate for you to drink . You shoot your guns off in the cemetery . Someone will get hurt . You 're already doing community service , Ti  --  it 's against the law . What happened to the man I knew ? TITOMO What happened to the sweet girl I knew ? PERI Little things do n't matter , TiTo , because I have one large complaint  --  TITOMO Which is ? REEP Man , you should n't ask those kind of questions . TITOMO You 're going to get told anyway , Reep . PERI What have we got to do with one another anymore ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been married twenty years , Peri . I would have taken you for a ride . I would have gone to the Pow Wow  --  PERI I just want to stay here with you  --  TITOMO Maybe I 'll shoot the sky again . Maybe the stars will shoot back . WILLIAM The reservoir is n't that far . The sheriff hears you , he 'll be back . TITOMO ( Looking at Peri ) You want to be with me  --  after twenty years ? You got to take me like I am , Peri . I 'm getting used to the rest of my life . William gets up and goes into the house . REEP ( Looking at Frennie ) Yep  --  I think I shot an angel in the cemetery . NEVILLE I heard the wings flapping . FRENNIE Aunt Julia made angel clothes . She worked her pedal machine . She made coats with slits to stick their wings through when they had to fly . Angels have such big feet . You can hear them in the house at night . The upstairs floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REEP I 'm going to get a piece of that gumdrop cake . ( He goes into the house. ) p. 12 FRENNIE You can lift their angel dresses and see between their legs . They do n't need underwear  --  unless it 's winter and they fly over fields covered with ice . Reep and William come from the house . Reep follows William to his motorcycle in the yard . They look at the motor . William revs it enough to irritate Peri . Frennie holds her ears . When Aunt Julia slept , her feet worked the pedal . I could see the sheet move at night . The old pedal of her sewing machine was like an oil pump in the field . Aunt Julia had angels lined up at the door . She kept their clothes in her closets . PERI These old houses do n't have closets , Frennie . Aunt Julia kept a wardrobe in the corner . A closet is like a heart . It 's what 's missing in this house . ( Peri stands on the porch . ) TITOMO You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating like those zinnias in the wind  --  just let me sit with you  --  PERI  --  not even owning what is ours . ( Peri walks away . ) TITOMO If you follow her , William  --  I 'm lifting my pistol . NEVILLE He 'll shoot more than an angel . FRENNIE It 's name was Sulman. p. 13 REEP ( Returning to the porch ) @x William returns to the porch , where TiToMo sits with Neville and Reep. @x Peri and Frennie in the cemetery . Soon , Peri speaks to the people she imagines buried there . PERI What 's it like down there ? Are dreams realized ? Are tears wiped away ? Are memories swept up like beer cans after Labor Day ? Is it like drunkenness when we do n't remember all we went through to get there ? ( She kneels and puts her arm around one of the stones as though it were someone 's shoulder . ) Is God there in his majesty or is he really Adelaide , the cat , watching every move I make ? FRENNIE Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings ? PERI Oh , God ! Are you real ? Are you waiting up like Mother in one of her rages when I came in late from a date with TiTo ? Or like his mother , always grumbling about everything ? Are you as forgetful as he is of my birthday ? ( Pause ) Oh , remember me , God  --  ( Peri walks to another grave and takes hold of the stone . ) How do we get so careless ? ( Peri reads the monument she leans against . ) Beth Grant , Beloved Wife of  --  ( She ca n't make out the rest of it . ) How many stars for faithfulness ? Sometimes I see the children of Galilee around Jesus as he tells his fish stories and always how the biggest one yet is waiting for us on the other side . Never here  --  though our prairie sky at dusk must be like the desert in Galilee . That 's what I always used to think , anyway , when I 'd see those pictures in the Bible . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road in Oklahoma  --  ( Peri puts her ear to the monument . ) Tell me , Beth  --  how did you get marked , Beloved Wife ? p. 16 FRENNIE I remember when we moved out of the old place into Aunt Julia 's house  --  how our voices echoed off the walls  --  PERI ( She leans over a smaller monument and reads the name . ) Harriet  --  Does God look us over like school papers ? Does he keep grades ? I remember how my mother always went over my school papers . I remember throwing the bad ones in the gutter on the way home from school , and I remember standing beside her as she looked over my good papers and saved them for my father and Frennie and my brothers to see . You know , these shiny upright stones are just like TV screens . Do we sit down and talk to one another about what matters ? Does someone take us down the road and let us out to find our way ? I remember my friend , Ocholee . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and letting her out ? I bet that 's the way it feels . How about it , Edwin ? ( She reads another gravestone . ) Was her father really doing her a favor ? Did Ocholee know better than us what it 's like ? Was she more prepared than we are ? ( Pause ) Does God own a cafe ? Is there someone to cook for ? Does anyone have the old recipe for cottage pudding ? Jamaican chicken my great aunt used to make ? Rum and diablo sauce ? ( Pause ) I would hate to arrive in heaven and find no tables or kitchen . William says Jesus ate after he went to heaven . p. 17 FRENNIE And here 's your grave  --  Aunt Julia  --  PERI You dragged us out of Indian ways into Christian . Is there anyone who knows how I feel ? I would be happy with TiTo , but he keeps closing the door , catching my fingers sometimes . Do we just put everything in the truck and move on ? Turning our keys over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a new migration trail  --  relocating to the cities , returning to the land  --  always on our restless travels over highways and roads  --  never settled ? Do n't leave me , TiTo . I 'd hate to give it all up yet . How can we live together and forget how to know one other ? TiTo just wants to drink and talk and laugh on the porch with his friends , and when they leave , he 's drunk . ( Pause ) And here are the graves of Fift and Chune , Ti 's friends , killed in a bike accident . I feel so empty , Frennie . Frennie holds her arm around Peri , comforts her . You got to go to your own house sometimes , Frennie . FRENNIE Sulman , the angel , kept us under his wing . PERI ( Peri gets up , walks to another stone. ) @x Peri and Frennie have returned from the cemetery and are in the kitchen . TiToMo , Neville , Reep , and William are on the front porch . It 's early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bike when he turned in the drive . WILLIAM Peri 's in the kitchen cooking more chicken . William goes into the house , while the rest of them sit on the porch . PERI I ca n't remember the recipe for the diablo rum sauce for the chicken . I do n't have rum , anyway . How 's diablo beer sauce ?  --  FRENNIE The chickens should be covered with angel sauce . If you knew how they suffered  --  William picks a gumdrop off Peri 's cake . He tastes the chicken and pours more beer in the pan . PERI If you pick one more gumdrop off that cake  --  ( Pause ) The sauce had something in it  --  some spice I ca n't remember . WILLIAM You got enough red chiles  --  my mouth 's hot as an exhaust pipe . PERI I was on the road with you all when my parents and brothers cleaned out Aunt Julia 's house . Nobody knows what happened to her recipes . Probably thrown out  --  with the pictures of angels she had all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what matters to anyone . Sulman was the angel she kept on her bedroom wall  --  a sad angel with its hands pulled up in its sleeves  --  the way we pulled our arms inside our shirts when we were cold . Maybe Frennie 's got the picture somewhere . She can pack things away and forget . It 's her sort of thing . p. 19 TITOMO ( Calls again . ) Peri  --  PERI I 'm still frying children  --  chicken  --  ( To Frennie ) Tell them to get the plates  --  the napkins , knives , forks , and bowls of food on the table . Stir up that bean salad I got in the fridge , Frennie . The bread 's in the oven , darling . Cut the last of that gumdrop cake  --  whatever is left of it  --  and have Neville slice the rest of that watermelon William brought . Soon everyone is in the kitchen . TITOMO Where do you want the chicken ? PERI Anywhere on the table  --  get that big platter off the top shelf . TiToMo dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch . PERI Ti  --  I got some relish somewhere in the shed . TiToMo 's already in the yard and does n't hear Peri . William could tell him Peri asked him to go to the shed , but he does n't . William goes to the shed but ca n't find the relish . Soon Peri comes . William tries to embrace her in the shed . You drink too much over here , Bill , and do n't use a brake on yourself . You wait till Ti and I have a hard time , then you jump in like grease . p. 20 WILLIAM I 'll take you for a ride . PERI I ride with TiTo . Get the relish there on the shelf . TiToMo and Frennie enter the shed . TiToMo is eating a chicken leg . TITOMO What you doing here ? PERI William 's getting the relish . TITOMO There 's not going to be any chicken left  --  PERI Bill and I been tasting while I cooked . You know I do n't eat much after it 's done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drink too much more of that beer , Bill  --  William takes the relish to the yard . Frennie opens one of TiToMo 's mother 's boxes before he knows what she 's doing . She lifts a Bible from the box . She opens the Bible and finds a letter . She hands it to TiToMo . He drops the chicken leg and wipes his hands on his jeans . A letter to Mildred Forster , my mother  --  from Hupata , her father . ( He reads . ) You wanted to go to school . But there was no money . You got married . You left your people , went off to a navy base on the East Coast where you say all the wives are sealed up in their houses . Remember our tradition . Teach your children . Your mother cries for you . Why did you turn your back on her ? ( TiToMo unfolds the pages . ) There 's other letters  --  Mildred Forster  --  my mother  --  wants something . Money to come home . But there is n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two boys to care for . But she misses the land . She wants to be somewhere other than the housing on the base . TiToMo folds the letters and closes them in the Bible . He sits for awhile in the shed . The others talk and laugh in the yard while they eat . Open the boxes if you want  --  ( TiToMo leaves the shed. ) p. 21 PERI That 's why TiTo is afraid of these boxes of his mother 's things . They open the old days for him  --  FRENNIE The smell of yellowed newspaper . PERI Ah ! some of her dishes . ( She stops to read bits of the news . ) Libya slaps trade ban on Britain . ( She continues reading . ) A parachuting pig was to be dropped from a plane over the State Fair , but due to public protest , country police arrived with warrants in the names of several committeemen . If the pig were hurt in any way , they were going to get slapped on the spot with a cruelty-to-animals charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead a package of freshly ground sausage with a letter saying the pig was now in a form the Society for Prevention to Animals could n't object to ! ( Peri is silent a moment as she looks at the old paper . Soon she begins reading more of it  --  ) Mrs. Jones , 56 , died of a heart attack Wednesday evening at the home . She was the widow of James P. Jones who died in 1944 . ( Peri looks at the date of the paper . ) Baltimore Banner . 1965 . Funeral services for John F. Conklin , 62 , an auto salesman for about 40 years , will be held at 10 A.M. Mrs. Bitzer , 93 , born in Baltimore County  --  Surviving are two sons , William J. Bitzer and Woodrow Bitzer , with whom she lived  --  ( Peri scans the paper . She looks quickly at another page of the paper , then tosses it aside and continues to unwrap a few dishes remaining in one of the boxes . ) Saucers and bread-and-butter plates . ( She turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Julia used to have . PERI Cowboys and Indians that must have been TiTo 's and his brother 's . Popeye . Baseball cards . A U.S. Navy banner . FRENNIE A compass . PERI A picture TiTo drew of his hand . A bride and groom off a wedding cake . FRENNIE What a collector  --  PERI ( She opens another box and sorts through the things . ) Strainers . Muffin tins . Now we 're getting to it . FRENNIE A six-shooter ? PERI TiTo 's or his brother 's , I guess . A recipe box ! Recipe books ! Jackpot ! ! His mother 's cookbooks ! ! ( Peri opens one quickly and reads  --  ) Truss the fowl and cook it in its stock for an hour . While it is cooking , heat the butter  --  blanch the almonds  --  shred the onions  --  slice the raisins , cloves , cinnamon . ( Peri turns the pages of the books . ) Potted carp . Planked mackerel . Sardine toast . Halibut and tomatoes . FRENNIE How old are those recipes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reads further . ) Watermelon rind  --  that sounds like my recipe . Birthday Delight  --  Macaroons  --  Muffins  --  Peri keeps reading cookbooks , turning pages of recipes . Frennie grabs the newspapers that blow in the wind . p. 23 FRENNIE The papers are like angels flapping their wings  --  Peri , what keeps us here ? Why do n't we blow away like Ocholee ? PERI It 's just the wind that 's up , Frennie  --  making everything flop . ( Peri unwraps a box with an Indian sash in it . ) Look , Frennie , some beading Ti 's mother must have done . And here is a rock she kept  --  she must have taken it from her father 's place . TiToMo returns to the shed . He picks up some of the things Peri has unwrapped and puts them down again . He fingers the six-shooter . The wind picks up a little and blows some papers again . Peri grabs them and weights them down with a corner of a box . @x William , Reep , and Frennie sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , standing around the motorcycles . It is late evening . REEP Look at those gravestones shining like moons  --  WILLIAM ( To Peri as she comes from the kitchen to sit on the porch ) The angels can put their feet on backwards  --  they get to start again . PERI The woman down the road puts out seed for the birds  --  then watches Adelaide , her cat , stalk them . Yes , she puts out seed  --  but she loves the destroyer more . FRENNIE Aunt Julia held things together for us . How do we find our way back ? PERI We do n't go back , Frennie . FRENNIE What do we do ? PERI We go on . We lost what it was to be Indian . We lost ourselves . TITOMO I 'm shooting my fear when I lift my pistol . PERI What if it shoots back ? ( She goes to the yard and stands with TiToMo. ) @x The men are all on the porch . Peri and Frennie are in the kitchen . REEP Peri 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting older . WILLIAM She had it her own way , and now she 's turned up short . NEVILLE She 's just mad because everyone talks to the young waitresses now . TITOMO I tried to help Peri once and forgot her birthday . She 's remembered it ever since . I do n't forget anymore , though . Her mama reminds me . I do n't have a chance to forget . They 're all coming over here next weekend . No  --  I do n't have a chance to do much of anything without Peri telling me about it  --  William goes into the kitchen for another beer . PERI You 've had enough beer , Bill . Slice us a piece of watermelon . William sits at the table with Peri . A man is driving down the road behind a farmer with a truckload of pigs when one falls out . WILLIAM That 's an old one . PERI The man stops at a filling station and asks , what do I do with a pig ? p. 27 WILLIAM Suppose a pig were following a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I do with a farmer ? FRENNIE Take him to the chicken farm . Cover him with feathers . WILLIAM The shortest distance between two points is a bullet through the air  --  REEP ( Entering the kitchen ) Buck ! Buck ! FRENNIE Jesus is a chicken herder . Seeker of the lost . We lay our eggs like prayers . TITOMO ( He comes into the kitchen . ) What 's up , Peri ? You can laugh with Bill but not me ? PERI It 's just me and Bill telling stories , eating watermelon in the kitchen . WILLIAM ( With his hands on Peri 's shoulders ) Come on , TiTo  --  TITOMO ( Shoves William away from Peri . Angrily  --  ) Do n't put your hands on my wife again . REEP Everyone  --  out of here . Peri stays at the table with her hands over her face .

TiToMo pushes William back . REEP Hey  --  TiTo , break it up ! Stop ! What else have we got now but friends ? Reep and Neville pull TiToMo away from William . William , out of breath , sits on the porch . TiToMo stands in the yard . Peri comes out of the house and walks across the yard . WILLIAM ( Standing , still out of breath , walks toward the cemetery . ) I got to cool off . TITOMO Forget it , man  --  I did n't mean  --  I get jealous as hell over Peri  --  you know that  --  TiToMo follows Peri to a corner of the yard . Frennie follows TiToMo . TITOMO Hey  --  Tunafish  --  Wait up . Where you want to go ? PERI The name 's Peri . Somewhere on the prairie where the streetlights do n't line up like baby teeth . I want to ride into the stars of the night , TiTo . I want to follow the angels that took off with my Aunt Julia . p. 29 TITOMO Do n't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and knees , pecking in the yard like a hen . ) Cluck . Cluck . PERI You 're not a chicken , Frennie . Do n't cluck . I know you get upset when we fight . The ball lightning struck you in the chicken house . I was there  --  you did n't turn into a chicken . FRENNIE I was born a chicken . Sometimes I think I pecked at the shell . PERI No , you did n't . FRENNIE The lightning struck me because I was a chicken . I always belonged to the chickens . PERI You belong to Jesus , Frennie . Remember what Aunt Julia said ? FRENNIE You know the story of Indians when they turn white  --  when they forget their ways , they grow feathers and become chickens . PERI I never heard that , Frennie . Just keep Jesus in your head . TITOMO We got stars in Bible school for saying what they wanted . Where 's my pistol ? I want to shoot the stars . Reep lifts his pistol and shoots into the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes off from the yard , rides through the cemetery . Reep follows . Peri yells after them . p. 30 PERI You ca n't ride through the cemetery  --  my aunt 's over there . Fift . Chune . Beth Grant . Edwin . Your friends , TiTo , have n't got sense . Peri runs after the men . The bikes zoom through the cemetery . Peri screams at them in fury , gives up , and runs back to the yard . The bikes continue to tear around the cemetery . Peri covers her ears . FRENNIE The clouds are the wings of a chicken  --  It 's lightning in the chicken house  --  There 's wind and lightning . One last shot is heard . Then everything is dark and silent . @x Peri and Frennie are on the front porch . Reep rides his bike into the yard . William follows , running . It is dark . REEP Peri  --  PERI Where 's TiTo ?

Peri runs behind Reep . There 's the sound of Reep 's motorcycle riding into the cemetery . Frennie follows them , running . Frennie is crying . Now Peri is screaming . PERI ( Covering her face in a bright light that appears suddenly in the dark. )
