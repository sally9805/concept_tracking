<p> FEATURED LETTER <p> Chicago 's museums open doors to the wonders of science , art , exploration , nature , our Earth , the heavens and the deep blue seas . This world-famous collection of institutions is the envy of urban America . Tourists never forget visits to our Art Institute , Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum just to name a few of our icons . <p> As a youth , I wandered these hallowed buildings in awe of dinosaurs , a submarine , a coal mine and " Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte . " The only cost for these life-enriching hours was bus fare . <p> The free admission to our museums is long gone , with several exceptions . The admission policies of many now seem geared toward tourists and conventioneers with unlimited expense accounts . Chicago area residents who have not made a museum run in a while will need a pocketful of cash . <p> A family of mom and dad with two kids will need $26 to get through the door at the Adler Planetarium . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of July 1 . <p> Mom and dad and those two kiddies will need $24 at the Field Museum ; $24.50 at the Museum of Science and Industry ; $22 at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum , and at Shedd Aquarium , a whopping $72 for mom , dad and two children under 11 . <p> There are others , but I feel I 've made my point . Chicago 's museums are expensive to visit . <p> Most have memberships , special rates for students and seniors , and some have free days , but if you ca n't match up with them , you pay full freight or you do n't get in . <p> There is one exception : The Art Institute claims that any patron unable to pay the admission fee will be admitted for less , but they must offer some amount . <p> Our remarkable city is one day going to be so expensive that we 'll all have to move away and come back as tourists to enjoy things . What a shame . <p> Special exhibits at the Art Institute , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but general admissions to all of our cultural institutions need review . There must be days when these hallowed buildings are not very busy . <p> Now you know why . <p> Ed Schwartz , Lake View <p> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR <p> Banking on security <p> Who can blame banks for putting extra security measures in place at their facilities " Neighbors protest new bank , " news story , June 16 ? Admit it , Rev. Michael Pfleger and the local residents live in a crime-riddled neighborhood where local merchants sell their goods from behind bulletproof glass , so why is he offended that a bank would take extra steps to secure its business ? <p> Pfleger also said the bank should get out of the community if it is going to conduct business this way . My response is : Close the bank and let the people of Chatham go back to getting ripped off at the currency exchange down the street . <p> I only have two questions for the reverend : How many people in that neighborhood have bars on their own windows ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rites of the innocent people who will be shot if a robbery occurs there ? This is n't racist . It 's just good judgment by the bank that is willing to do business in a high-risk area . <p> Steve Medel , Tinley Park <p> Bank insults customers <p> Your June 16 news story , " Neighbors protest new bank , " points out that the bank has posted a sign banning guns from the bank and installed metal detectors . <p> I thought handguns have long been banned in Chicago . As a former resident of the Chicago suburbs , I thought the plan of Mayor Daley ( both Jr . and Sr. ) was to ban guns and eliminate crime . Is this an admission by the bank that banning guns has not worked ? After all , if it had , there would be no need for metal detectors . Or is it that by banning guns in Chicago , only law-abiding citizens followed the law , and now only the criminals have guns ? <p> I find the bank 's policy intrusive and insulting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I agree with Rev. Michael Pfleger when he tells bank officials to get out of the community . You should n't have to be treated like a suspect when putting money into your local bank . <p> Here in Minnesota , law-abiding citizens are allowed to carry firearms . The banks I do business with are not posted ( do not ban guns ) and have had no problems . The ones who have been robbed all had signs up banning firearms on their premises . It 's sort of like shouting to the bad guys : " Hey , we 're unarmed . Come and get it ! " <p> Gary A. Shade , <p> Apple Valley , Minn . <p> Greeley is wrong <p> I am very saddened that Andrew Greeley column , June 11 would think that there are parallels between Germany of the 1930s and the United States of today . I see parallels to the actions of President Bush to those of FDR . FDR did not want to enter World War ll , but was forced to because of the attack on Pearl Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Germany declared war on us . Did our journalists at that time question this ? No , the country deemed it necessary because of the unbridled actions of Hitler . His extermination of Jewish people was unfathomable at that time , as was flying airplanes into buildings to kill people now . <p> Now let us fast-forward . Bush 's advisers , whom Greeley refers to as practitioners of the Big Lie  --  i.e. , weapons of mass destruction  --  have relied on the best intelligence available . Former President Bill Clinton , Vice President Al Gore , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and even Sen. John Kerry have made statements in the past that they believed Iraq and Saddam Hussein possessed WMD . Is this war justifiable ? Let us deal with these parallels . Hitler ordered millions of people to be murdered . Saddam ordered the murder of more than 300,000 of his own people . Saddam 's sons were equally brutal , torturing and murdering Iraqis . Now hospitals are being built , schools are allowing girls to be educated , their oil pipelines are being repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> I pray that Greeley will realize someday that our president is not the enemy . Those who murder and sponsor terrorism , such as Saddam , are . This is a just war . <p> Brian Tiemens , Lansing <p> Greeley is offensive <p> I found Greeley 's column contrasting President Bush with Adolf Hitler to be offensive and inappropriate . This comparison makes light of the Holocaust . Comparing Bush to the man who murdered two out of every three European Jews and many thousands of others is vile . <p> Michael A. Atkinson , <p> Mundelein <p> Energy crisis <p> Is OPEC the reason the Cubs keep running out of gas ? <p> Joseph Stachowski , <p> Near North Side <p> Let the real fans in <p> It 's time for all of the fake Cub fans to get out of the ballpark and go to the bars . <p> It 's a shame that real Cub fans ca n't get tickets because of all the people who attend the game because . . . well , because it 's just the thing to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park " sports story , June 10 about the tourists who could n't get tickets . One said that she never watches the game , anyway ; she 'd rather be outside chatting . Well , that 's her and thousands of others at the game . People look at me funny when I go to the game because I 'm actually watching the game . <p> To all those yuppies who go to the game because you think it 's cool , please do all the Cub fans a favor : Go to the bars . <p> Edwin Boksa , West Town <p> Cubs need dose of reality <p> I am sick and tired of listening to the Chicago Cubs players whine and cry over their so-called injuries . <p> If I did n't show up for work every day that I was n't 100 percent , I would have been fired or be unemployed by now . Every morning I have a sore elbow , knee , back or whatever , but I tough it out , and I work a real job . I do n't play baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job for a day to bring them back from fantasyland . <p> Daniel M. Filipek , <p> Mount Prospect <p> What about abuse scandal ? <p> Cardinal Francis George 's quick directive to lay ministers who disagree with church teachings was harsh and swift : Believe as you are taught and told or get out metro story , June 10 ! <p> It is the sign of a good leader to analyze a situation , determine its consequences , reprimand its offenders and direct a resolve . <p> It 's unfortunate that George , along with so many other Catholic leaders , did n't use this same expedient method when it came to the priest abuse scandal . <p> Kinda sorta like the Eveready bunny : just keeps going on and on and on ! <p> Michael J. D'Ambra , <p> Near North Side <p> MY TWO CENTS <p> " Who can blame banks for putting extra security measures in place at their facilities ?
