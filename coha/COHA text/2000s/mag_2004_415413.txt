Thank you , George Lucas , for finally putting the classic STAR WARS TRILOGY on DVD and spilling the beans about Darth Vader in " Episode III , " the saga 's future on TV , and how Han Solo is n't a murderer . by Mark Harris // AS THE WHOLE MOVIEGOING WORLD KNOWS by now , George Lucas grew up on cliff-hanger movie serials , so it 's especially momentous that the 60-year-old **29;3328;TOOLONG innovator is at last about to wrap up all of the plot threads and close the book on a three-decade phase of his career that he still , surprisingly , refers to as a " detour . " This week brings the long-awaited arrival of the revised ( he prefers " completed " ) editions of Star Wars , The Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi on DVD , with retoolings that will delight many fans and frustrate some film preservationists . At the same time , a double-disc edition of Lucas ' first film , 1971 's dark , dystopian THX1138 , in which Lucas directed a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably grimmer vision of a George Lucas future world and get a taste of the semi-abstract experimental filmmaking that he once expected would define his career . ( see reviews on pages 88-89 . ) And next May 19 will bring the release of Star Wars : Episode III-Revenge of the Sith , the movie that finally reveals just how and why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader , and is likely to push the Star Wars franchise 's worldwide grosses close to the $4 billion mark . On a recent visit to New York City during which Lucas , his early boss Francis Ford Coppola , and his THX 1138 coscreenwriter-sound designer Walter Murch reunited to celebrate THX 's rerelease , Lucas sat down with EW to talk about Star Wars ' past , present , and future . EW What 's the line between restoring a film and altering it ? Obviously , the versions of the Star Wars Trilogy and THX 1138 on DVD go far beyond what we saw in theaters . GL Film is so expensive , and it 's run by corporations . They just take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time at the point where it got yanked out of your hands . I 've been lucky enough to be able to go back and say " No , I 'm going to finish this the way it was meant to be finished . " When Star Wars came out , I said it did n't turn out the way I wanted-it 's 25 percent of what I wanted it to be . It was very painful for me . So the choice came down to , do I please myself and finally make the movie that I wanted , or do I allow the audience to see the half-finished version that they fell in love with ? If you really look at it , there 's hardly any changes at all . The thing that really caused the trouble on Star Wars is the whole question of whether Han Solo or Greedo shoots first . The way it got cobbled together at the time , it came off that Han fired first . He did n't fire first . EW So you consider this a correction ? GL It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , I do n't have that shot , so I 'll just , you know , fudge it editorially . " In my mind Greedo shot first or at the same time . We like to think of Han Solo as a murderer because that 's hip-I do n't think that 's a good thing for people . I mean , I do n't see how you could redeem somebody who kills people in cold blood . Every other change is , you know , I wanted to have a good matte painting here . It 's the same thing with THX-there is nothing changed except now I was able to show that they were in a city . In the end , all I change are the things that I tried to do originally but I could n't for whatever reason . Nobody seems to mind the idea of a " director 's cut . " But to go the next step and say , had they given me another week 's shooting , or another $50,000 to finish these matte paintings , this is what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changing your mind . Star Wars was not meant , in the end , to be seen more than once in a movie theater . It was designed to be a large theatrical experience that , if you saw it once on a giant screen , would blow you away . But this was before there was such a thing as DVD . If you went down and sort of analyzed it and looked at it frame by frame , you can see the tricks that are going on . There 's a lot of stuff that 's very thin , as in any old movie . EW Can you envision a future in which a filmmaker who did n't get the actor he wanted the first time can drop in a new performance to " perfect " the movie ? GL It has to do with the creative predilections of the director-what he wants and how strongly he feels about it . But you could do that . The real issue is , who has the right to do that ? I fall 100 percent on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I assume that you are strongIy opposed to those companies that offer people G or PG versions of R-rated films . GL If it is objectionable to them , they should not see the movie . You know , Fm hoping they sanitize The Passion of the Christ . I would love to see that , because they 're going to have to cut half the movie out . So are they going to do that ? Or are they going to say , well , this is exceptional because it 's about Christ ? What they are really doing is censoring . And my feeling is , artists have a right to have their work shown as they intended it . EW On the THX 1138 commentary track , you say that in a way , everything after THX was an unexpected detour for you . That 's a big detour . GL Well , the detour basically was success . I never thought I 'd be successful . I was going to become a documentary filmmaker , cameraman , and editor in San Francisco . That was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarships-one at Warner Bros , to work with Francis Coppola . And I said , well , I 'll just go and do my little six-month tour . Out of that , Francis got me the deal to write THX as a feature . I said , this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . I had no career to destroy . I did n't want to work in the film business , so I did n't care . And then , at the end ofthat movie , I was faced with making a living . EW You 've said that in Star Wars , you were trying to capture something for young viewers that would connect with the fun that you had at Saturday-afternoon serials . But the saga is actually pretty sad . If you take it as the story of the guy who became Darth Vader , is n't it a six-movie series about someone losing his humanity ? GL But being resurrected by his children . We all have to make up for our fathers , you know . Believe me , our kids are really going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on right now . That 's a classic theme , you know-if one generation succumbs , it 's up to the next generation to redeem that generation . EW Say that it 's 2010 , and I 'm a 10-year-old coming to Star Wars movies for the first time . Should I start with Episode IV ( Star Wars ) or Episode I ( Phantom Menace ) ! GL Your order should be I , II , III , IV , V , VI . Part of the fun for me is that one generation will have seen it backwards . For the next generation that sees it from 7 to VI , there are a lot of things in W Star Wars that were just fantastic in 1977-you know , the cantina-which are n't going to work . In those days , you did n't put monsters in a bar . A monster was a thing that came from a spaceship and ate everybody . Now every sci-fi bar you walk into has got aliens . But what 's really important is the story , and the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know Darth Vader 's the main character because you saw him in previous movies . So when Darth Vader walks in , you say , oh , my God . Now , when you come across Princess Loia , you know that 's his daughter right away , and you think , does he know ? No , he does n't know . Or does he know ? And when you cut down to the planet and see Luke , you go , oh , my God , that 's Darth Vader 's son , and Ben Kenobi has been waiting all this time to send him on his adventure . You 're waiting for them to realize who everybody is . So it is a completely different movie . EW Is it unfair when people say that you 're impatient with actors ? Even your original Star Wars stars joke about how your directions to them were usually " Faster and more intense ! " GL " Faster and more intense " does n't mean that I 'm impatient with working with actors . It means they drag out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene out to 45 minutes if you let them . I do say " Faster and more intense ! " and I say it a lot , because the movies that I 'm making are very fast movies by design . But I talk to the actors , I rehearse , I do what every other director does . Some directors like Francis love to spend hours and days and weeks ruminating over a part . A lot of other directors , you know , from John Ford to Kurosawa , basically go out and say , you stand here , move over there . Half of directing is great casting . It really is . If you cast it right , then you do n't have to do too much work . EW You tend not to be very optimistic about whether your movies will be hits . You had grave doubts about both American Graffiti and Star Wars . Has that persisted with the second trilogy ? GL I said , well , Phantom Menace is not going to work because I 'm making it about a 10-year-old boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . It 's like one of these Disney movies or Benji movies . People do n't want that-they want to see Darth Vader , and I 'm not giving them Darth Vader , so do n't expect this thing to be a hit . And then Attack of the Clones is a love story . It 's old-fashioned like in the ' ' 40s , you know , it 's not a modern , hip , happening romantic comedy with the Olsen twins . It 's kind of corny and it 's using an aesthetic that is out of use now . I 'm not sure whether young people are going to take to it . So at least Darth Vader is in Episode HI . Only for two minutes , but he 's in it . If you take them all together it 's a fascinating saga . EW Your original title was The Star Wars . When did the fall off the title page ? GL Before I started shooting , I think . You know , I never expect anyone to see a script , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but because I 'm directing it , I do n't have to write it , I do n't have to show it to a studio , I do n't have to sell it to anybody . It does n't have to be written for somebody else to understand . So I write a minimalist script that has hardly anything in it at all . What Francis taught me about writing scripts is , when you are writing your first draft , race through it as fast as you can . I can get it done in two or three weeks . And when you 're writing that first script , never go back and read the page before . If you go back and start refining it , you 'll have a very refined 15 pages but it will never go anywhere . And you really do n't know what the first 15 pages should be until you know what the end is . EW Watching THX-which deals with a totalitarian culture and the consequences of rampant consumerism-alongside the Star Wars movies suggests that you 're a surprisingly political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I try to deal with political themes . The thing is , I make my movies my way , and they have sort of been taken as light entertainment . But I put in a lot of my own feelings and views . EW Would the Empire have referred to the Rebel Alliance as terrorists , rhetorically ? GL That 's a very politically charged word . I 'm not sure terrorists have defined themselves as terrorists-they have defined themselves as rebels . And that 's what we were , you know , we 're the rebels . We are a nation of terror , we came out of terrorism-well , I mean , for God 's sake , we are rebels , but the British would n't have described us that way . If you were to look at Siar Wars for what it actually is-get rid of all that cool stuff-one of its major issues is how you get W from a democracy into a dictatorship without a coup . How did the Senate turn it over to Caesar ? How did France turn over their republic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hitler ? That 's embedded in the three films that are coming out now . When the third one is put in , you 'll say , " Oh , I see how that all works . " The controversy is going to be that people expect some horrible , horrific thing to happen to Anakin that caused him to become Darth Vader . It 's much subtler . It 's something that everybody faces-when you 're looking at yourself , you can see your good and your bad , and say , " Is this a selfish choice or is this a compassionate choice ? And once I get something , what would I do to keep from losing it ? Would I make a pact with the devil to keep it ? " EW You remain as opposed to making a movie for a studio as you were early in your career . GL It 's because the people in the studios do n't know anything-there 's nobody really in charge of knowing how you actually physically make a movie . How you really do it day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , that 's why you 're getting budgets of $250 million-there 's a couple of movies in production that are close to $300 million . I 'm still making movies at $100 million . EW $100 million of your money . GL It 's my money , but I also know what I 'm doing . You know , you can keep it rational . I love cameramen and they 're very talented and I defend them , but I know how to shoot a picture , so I could actually shoot it myself if I really wanted to . And I 'm not going to pay a million to a cameraman . A cameraman can make what the president of the United States makes , but not a million . EW You 're pretty definitive about not making the once-rumored third Star Wars trilogy-episodes VII , VIII , and IX . GL I 'm not going to do it . I 'm too old . I 've got other movies I want to do . And I do n't want anybody else to do it , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may be TV offshoots from people , but the saga itself , the story of the Skywalker family , is over .
