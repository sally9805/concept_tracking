2003 BIKE BUYER 'S GUIDE Headnote Not sure what you want ? Afraid of getting ripped off ? Do n't know what to ask ? Here 's everything you need to make the purchase nearly as much fun as the ride . // With a transit strike looming last December , New York City 's billionaire mayor Michael Bloomberg did what any sensible urbanite would do : He bought a bike for commuting . Bloomberg dropped into Gotham Bikes in Tribeca and , after a carefully scripted photo-op , walked out with a shiny black Cannondale F300 mountain bike . Great PR for Cannondale , but bad news for Bloomberg . Instead of buying one of the company 's more commuter  --  friendly models ( or the suave about-towner Bianchi Milano just behind him in The New York Times ' front-page photo ) , Bloomberg selected a bike with knobby tires and a suspension fork , better suited for the trail than the street . " We offered to put some smooth , Specialized Armadillo tires on the bike , " says Ismael Torres , who rang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more durable . " Even the insanely rich and powerful can end up with the wrong bike . " We try to encourage people to focus on their needs instead of their wants , " says Torres . " But , obviously , it 's hard . " For a clear-eyed look at what bike best matches your riding ambition , check out " The Perfect Bike " on page 77 . The Universals Whatever your choice , your bike should have these features : * Sturdy Frame-With an Even Sturdier Warranty . Tell the salesperson you want the bike with the best frame you can afford . Components come and go , but the lifespan of the frame is essentially the lifespan of the bike . For most bikes , you should get a lifetime frame warranty-it lasts as long as you ( the original buyer ) own it . The exception : Ultralight , high-end racing bikes often come with warranties shorter than 5 years . * Quality Drivetrain . Shimano , Campagnolo and SRAM are the biggest , and most trustworthy , component brands . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derailleurs , shifters , crankset , bottom bracket , chain and cassette-that are n't from the Big Three , ask the salesperson for an explanation . Some brands , such as RaceFace or FSA , are high-quality boutique manufacturers ; some are reputable house brands owned by the company that produces the bike ; others , however , are lower-quality substitutions , placed on the bike purely to keep the price down . * Worthy Wheels . Besides the frame , quality hoops are the most essential element for a fast , fun ride . Never buy a bike with steel rims ; aluminum is lighter and stops better . ( Some high-end wheels have carbon rims . ) Stainless-steel spokes , or those treated with a weather-resistant coating , improve durability . Tires that have a folding , or Kevlar , bead are lighter and more nimble than steel beads . To identify a Kevlar tire , read the writing on the label or sidewall , or ask the salesperson . Time to Buy You can find rock-bottom deals online or , if you comb through ads and catalogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we recommend the local bike shop , even if the price is slightly higher . The staff of a good shop becomes your doctor , guru , friend , psychologist . The owners and mechanics will fuss with your bike until it fits you perfectly , remember your preferences in setup , and help your gear grow right along with your love of the sport . You often get free or reduced-fee tune  --  ups for up to a year . And if there are any problems with your new bike , all you have to do is roll it through the door . Be sure to ask any question-from " How does the shifting work ? " to " Do any pros ride this bike ? " Part of what you 're paying for is knowledge . Here are three questions you should always have answered : * Why is the next model up better ? * Why is the next model down not as good ? * Does another manufacturer make a better bike for the money ? Another huge advantage to buying locally : the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you take a spin around the parking lot ( or block ) . A bike that , according to the numbers , should fit you just might feel strange . And bikes you 're ready to dismiss might be magic . Be sure to ride bikes one level better and cheaper than the one you think you want . Finally , do n't expect to haggle over bike prices . The margins are n't plush enough to allow much wiggle room for dealers . When it comes to parts related to fit or comfort ( such as the stem , saddle , handlebar or pedals ) , you should be able to swap them for free or for reduced prices . And some shops give you a discount on accessories when you buy a bike . <p>
