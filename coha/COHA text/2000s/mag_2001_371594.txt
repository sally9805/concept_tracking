With U.S. forces in Afghanistan zeroing in on the leaders of the al-Qaeda network , one was tempted to imagine that Osama bin Laden and his top men were burning in an-Nar , the Koran 's hell  --  and that the war on terrorism was coming to a close . But is the outlook really so clear ? Will the network 's foot soldiers retreat and hide , the hydra withering after its bearded heads are lopped off ? Or can the beast survive even if bin Laden and his lieutenants are dead or captured ? Can al-Qaeda operatives around the world keep terrorizing without their leaders ' instructions ? <P> Intelligence analysts in many of the 50 or so nations with an al-Qaeda presence are gaming out multiple scenarios , all highly speculative , but most observers agree that the network could still function without its board of directors . After all , the base has long been more metaphor than description ; it 's not as though there was a headquarters building . Rather , al-Qaeda provided training and inspiration to about 11,000 men  --  according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps . Al-Qaeda 's leaders sent them back home with like-minded compatriots , a knowledge of explosives and heady ideas about global jihad . Many were willing to travel for a fight  --  perhaps to Chechnya and Bosnia , perhaps to the top floors of the World Trade Center . <P> " This movement , these groups , are far too spread out , diffuse and fluid for a single operation to knock them out , " says Irene Stoller , who in May retired after 13 years as director of France 's antiterror division . " Bin Laden and his lieutenants may seem from the outside like super-managers of international Islamist terror , but the real planning and execution is carried out at lower levels . " <P> The question is , Will people at those lower levels continue to plan and execute strikes against the West , vivifying bin Laden 's dreams of far-flung struggle ? Or will they perhaps return to their native countries and direct their anger toward the homegrown grievances that so radicalized them in the first place ?

" With the fall of Afghanistan , we 'll be seeing a lot of ' ex-Taliban ' and ' ex-al-Qaeda ' without sanctuary . These people will probably return home to Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Algeria and elsewhere to take up struggles there . " <P> Mustafa Alani agrees . A Middle East expert at the London-based Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies , he believes that many al-Qaeda operatives in Europe already have slipped away and gone back to their homelands , in part to avoid the law-enforcement dragnet on the Continent . " There are always guidelines about what to do in an emergency , " he says , noting that terrorist groups like Egypt 's al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya and Egyptian Islamic Jihad always provided operatives with support teams to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. official told TIME recently that " bin Laden has always been a good forward thinker.
