Suddenly , the media-and Laura Bush-are concerned about an education gender gap . Funny , no one was scared when men were on top . // ALTHOUGH AMERICAN WOMEN STILL STRUGGLE FOR parity in many arenas , we have outpaced men in at least one : undergraduate college education . Currently , 57.4 percent of bachelor 's degrees in the United States are earned by women , 42.6 percent by men . This is an almost exact reversal from 1970 , when 56.9 percent of college graduates were males and 43.1 percent females . We should be celebrated for this landmark achievement , but instead it has engendered fear . Read the headlines : " Falling Male College Matriculation an Alarming Trend , " or " Admissions Officers Weigh a Heretical Idea : Affirmative Action for Men . " Notice , too , that a major focus of first lady Laura Bush 's new antigang task force is education for boys . As she 's been quoted , " The statistics are pretty alarming . Girls are going to college much more than boys . " Few worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as February 1999 , U.S. News &; World Report predicted that the rising tide of women college grads could close the salary gap and move women into positions of power as heads of corporations , presidents of universities and political leaders . At the other extreme , the article suggested , college education might become devalued-considered " a foolhardy economic decision " as has happened in other fields after women begin to predominate . Photograph Photograph // Still rare at the top What U.S. News failed to mention was that women are still a rare presence at the top ranks of the corporate and professional world despite earning more college degrees than men for 23 years . Women undertake stronger academic programs than men in high school , and receive higher average grades than men in both high school and college , but have n't been able to translate that success into equitable money and power . Consider these disparities as well : * Women currently earn nearly 59 percent of master 's degrees , but men outstrip women in advanced degrees for business , engineering and computer-science degrees-fields which lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the areas where women predominate . * Despite women 's larger numbers as undergrads and in master 's programs , men outnumber women in earning doctorates ( 54 percent ) and professional degrees ( 53 percent ) . * This year , the number of women applying to medical school outpaced men for the second time , but they are only predicted to be 33 percent of doctors by 2010. * Women comprise nearly half of the students entering law schools , but they 're miles from parity as law partners , professors and judges . Tests do n't tell the whole tale Women may lose a step on the career ladder even before they enter college . That 's because , despite their greater number of bachelor 's and master 's degrees , women remain at a disadvantage in college admissions testing-which affects their acceptance at elite schools . The main purpose of the SAT-on which women averaged 44 points lower than men last year-is to predict first-year grades . However , it consistently underpredicts the college performance of women , who earn higher college grades than men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arise from several factors biased toward male performance , including the fact that it 's a timed test and rewards guessing-and men tend to be more confident and risk-taking than women in such test situations . Also , the SAT puts many of the questions in a male context ( such as sports ) , which can further lower female confidence about knowing the material . In an attempt to even the gender playing field , a writing section that includes language questions and an essay was added to the SAT this year , after the University of California insisted that the test be more attuned to the skills necessary for college success . This may raise women 's SAT scores somewhat , since writing tests are an area in which they have traditionally outperformed males . Lower SAT scores keep qualified women from both attending the most competitive schools and from receiving National Merit Scholarships and other awards based on PSAT and SAT scores . The test biases against women then continue in graduate education , with such instruments as the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ) , Graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test ( LSAT ) . Thus , women have yet to predominate at the most prestigious colleges and universities , where graduates are tracked toward top leadership positions in society . With enormous numbers of both sexes applying to these schools , the admissions offices can choose their gender ratio . In 2005 , men outnumbered women at all the Ivy League schools except Brown and Columbia . Women are also significantly outnumbered at universities specializing in engineering and physical science , such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and California Institute of Technology in Pasadena . Affirmative action-for men ? The greater percentage of women earning bachelor 's degrees has given rise to some reactionary theories explaining why . Conservative analyst Christina Hoff Sommers insists the gap takes root in the more " girl-friendly " elementary school environment where boys are turned off to learning . In The War Against Boys : How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men ( Simon &; Schuster , 2000 ) , Hoff Sommers claims that schoolboys are " routinely regarded as protosexists , potential harassers and perpetuators of gender inequity " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher-education policy analyst Tom Mortensen , who has a special concern with underrepresented populations in higher education , also sees the college gender gap as part of a larger societal problem for men and boys . Mortensen says K-12 teachers , 75 percent of whom are women , are not providing the role models and learning styles boys need . Of course , this was never an issue during the decades when college graduates were mainly men , and has n't drawn much notice since the end of the Civil War-the time when women began their continuing predominance as elementary school teachers . If these theories seem to spring from a blame-thewomen viewpoint , there is a legitimate concern about the decline in male graduates at private colleges , where the gap has been greatest ( although public universities have also been affected ) . Admissions officers worry that their colleges ' value will be lowered by an imbalance of female students : The larger the female majority , some say , the less likely either males or females will want to apply . Speaking at a College Board conference several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender ratio was their upper limit . After that , said former Macalester College president Michael McPherson , " students will take notice . " Small private colleges are now using what can only be called " male affirmative action " to increase male enrollment : actively recruiting men by emphasizing their science , math and engineering courses , adding sports programs ( in violation of Title IX ) , sending extra mailings designed to attract men and even calling men to remind them of the admissions deadline . " Probably no one will admit it , but I know lots of places try to get some gender balance by having easier admissions standards for boys than for girls , " said Columbia University Teachers College president Arthur Levine to The New York Times national correspondent Tamar Lewin . Robert Massa , vice president of Dickinson College in Carlisle , Penn. , has said that the school now evaluates prospective male students less on grades and more on measures where they typically do better , such as SAT scores . Adds Coucher College admissions vice president Barbara Fritze , " Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and offered financial aid they had n't gotten before . " Massa reported that the number of first-year males at Dickinson rose from 36 percent to 43 percent in 2001 after they took affirmative action toward men , who were admitted with lower grades but comparable SAT scores . Women , meanwhile , had to be much better than men to make the cut : Nearly 62 percent of the women accepted to the school ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school class , compared to 42 percent of the men . This new form of affirmative action , even if begun with all good intentions , could lead to bad college-admissions policy . What if a university decides it does n't just want more men in attendance , but more white men ? The whole notion of affirmative action as a way to help disadvantaged populations succeed could be turned on its head . The income gap The real reason behind the undergrad gender gap may have much less to do with one 's sex and more to do with income , race and class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the American Council on Education in Washington , D.C. , decided that media stories about the decline of white male enrollment did n't intuitively jibe with what she saw happening , so she took a closer look at college student data , analyzing it by sex , age , race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status . She found the gender gap in college enrollment for students 18 to 24 years of age in 1995-96 occurred among low-income students of all racial/ethnic groups except Asian Americans . In fact , since 1995 , many more women than men from households making less than $30,000 attend college . The latest available data , from 2003-04 , shows there is an even smaller percentage of low-income males attending college than there were in 1995 , and they are from every racial/ethnic group . African American and Native American students have the largest gender gaps-males comprise just 37 percent of all low-income African American students and 36 percent of low-income Native Americans . Low-income Hispanic men reach a slightly higher 39 percent , and low-income white males 41 percent ( a drop from 46 percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 47 percent of that group 's low-income college students being male . Middle-income ( S30,000-$70,000 ) male students maintained gender parity with females 10 years ago , but since then the numbers have dropped somewhat . This may mean that fewer men from the lower end of this income bracket are attending college , says Eugene Anderson , senior research associate at the American Council on Education . At the highest income level ( 570,000 or more ) , though , men and women in all ethnic groups attend college in nearly equal numbers . No studies have been done to determine why more low-income women than men attend college , but there are theories . Economist Lester Thurow suggests that low-income men have been lured to the comfortable salaries of mechanical maintenance jobs . Low-income women , on the other hand , do n't have such opportunities , and without a college degree see themselves getting trapped in low-pay sales or service jobs , says King . Also , more men than women work in computer support or high-tech factories-jobs that do n't require bachelor 's degrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dropping out of college because of such reasons as escalating tuition and the attraction of high-paying factory work , according to a May piece in The New York Times ( " The College Dropout Boom : Diplomas Absence Strands Many in the Working Class " ) . Harvard president Lawrence H. Summers goes so far as to call this widening of the education gap between rich and poor our " most serious domestic problem " - and recent changes in federal grant formulas may exacerbate it even further ( see sidebar below ) . Uprising : minorities and older women On the bright side , ethnic minorities have made impressive gains as college students since 1976 , increasing their percentage in the total student body from 10 percent to 23 percent . Minority men 's share of all bachelor 's degrees has gone from 5 percent to 9 percent . But , again , minority women have outstripped them , more than doubling their share of bachelor 's degrees , from 5 percent to 14 percent of the total degrees awarded . Not only is that statistic a contributing factor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women are the majority of older ( 25+ ) students-and that demographic has been returning to college in record numbers . The " oldsters " now make up 27 percent of the undergraduate student body , and 61 percent of older students are women . King found that many of these students were African American or Latina , attending community colleges to improve future earnings in health-related fields . " This story is not one of male failure , or even lack of opportunity , " says King , " but rather one of increased academic opportunity and success among females and minorities . " Indeed , there has been no decline in bachelor 's degrees awarded to men ; the numbers awarded to women have simply increased . Feminists should continue to be concerned about encouraging low-income and minority students to attend college , using the current momentum to give these problems the attention they deserve . But in the meantime , we must remain vigilant about attempts to roll back our educational gains . The fact is , we 're a long way from threatening corporate America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just time to let men try to catch up to us , for a change .
