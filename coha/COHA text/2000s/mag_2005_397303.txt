GUTS IT IS IN ALL OF US TO BE BOLD , BRAVE , AND RESILIENT . THE MEN WHO SERVE AMERICA CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO PUSH THOSE QUALITIES TO WARRIOR STRENGTH <p> ON THE MORNING OF December 9 , 2003 , Peter Sprenger was 2 weeks from the end of an eventful tour in Iraq . He 'd been at the " tip of the spear , " in army parlance , spending the preceding 10 months roaring through the invasion of Iraq , occupying Baghdad , securing other restive towns . As a member of the 101st Airborne Division , he had a clear mission : to probe for trouble and take care of it . But on that particular morning , the trouble found him . <p> Corporal Sprenger drew radio duty that day in company headquarters in Tal Afar , 60 miles southwest of Mosul . He felt relatively safe in the shadow of a two-story guard tower , behind barbed wire and barricades , sheltered by a 12-foot-high cinder-block wall . The front doors of the building were open to the morning air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At 4:40 a.m. , he heard gunfire and suspected that it issued from neighboring buildings . But , no , it had come from the guard tower , and the bullets and barricades had failed to halt a suicidal insurgent bent on delivering 1,000 pounds of TNT to the 101st 's doorstep . The bomb detonated 10 to 15 yards from where Sprenger was standing . <p> Knocked down and blinded by the explosion , he crawled back to his position and patted himself down for missing parts . He felt warm blood , punctured flesh , and a confused tangle of facial features . He peeled back a tattered eyelid and saw a spiderweb of lines radiating out from a bloodred center . He remembers thinking , Yes , well , we 'd better let a professional deal with that one . <p> The eye that Corporal Sprenger sacrificed that morning , the seven units of blood he left on the walls and floor , are real costs . " Going through all that changes you , " he notes , with typical understatement . For a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sprenger 's case , it focused his vision of who he is and what he hopes to gain from his life . " People do n't look far enough into the future , " he says , " and gauge what 's realistic for them to accomplish . " <p> But he has . And that vision drove him to rehab his many wounds , turn down the desk job the army offered , and gear up for the most rigorous training any infantryman can endure : Ranger School . <p> Sprenger not only passed it , but was also singled out as the epitome of the Ranger creed  --  " Readily will I display the intestinal fortitude required to . complete the mission , though I be the lone survivor "  --  and asked to recite that creed at his graduation ceremony last July . <p> Since the army began keeping records a quarter century ago , he is the first man with his kind of physical disability to earn the Ranger patch . And by the time you read this , he will have returned to Iraq . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started . <p> AT THE HOME BASE OF THE 101st Airborne Division , in Fort Campbell , Kentucky , uniformity is the order of the day . Each Screaming Eagle wears the identical camo , haircut , and conqueror attitude that mark this fighting unit . During one classroom session attended by 200 soldiers , a narrator says , " Someday you may find yourself bursting into a roomful of terrorists . " The rest of his sentence is drowned out by the roar . <p> Still , it 's not hard to pick out Sprenger , even in this look-alike crowd ; his eye patch speaks volumes , and the hard lessons of Iraq are etched into his skin . He bears two vertical scars on his upper lip and one on the lower , where his skin was rent by the explosion ; he spat out six teeth and a chunk of jawbone . Shrapnel gouged a random pattern in his shoulders , back , and forehead . A dental bridge now covers the gap in his smile , and an eye patch blacks out his broken window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states a personal credo : " When you look beyond 50 yards , you only need one eye , anyway . " <p> As he walks through the base , his fellow soldiers notice , too , offering congratulations on Ranger School . They cite him as an example of what the 101st is all about . He 's polite in accepting the praise , but he 's looking past it now . " I did n't come back here to train , " he says , in one sentence dismissing the 61 days of hell known as Ranger School . " I came back to lead my guys into battle . " <p> Hard work is a theme that Sprenger , now 22 years old , returns to again and A again . He grew up in Stockton , California , the son of a high-school physics teacher and former army man . He knew from the start he was different from the kids around him . " I 've been used to hard work since I was 12 , " he says , summing up a list of jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you feel tired at the end of the day , you feel good . " <p> He spent his later high-school days running 6 miles a day and experimenting with " computer security , " as he slyly puts it . But he heard the bugle call early , entering a Junior ROTC program in high school and filing enlistment papers with an army recruiter after graduation . He attended college for a while , but then came the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington . <p> " After 9/11 , you heard a lot of people talk , but not act , " he says . " I was young and healthy , so why not me ? " <p> Not that he 's necessarily buying all the political rhetoric surrounding this war . " I have my own thoughts about committing or removing troops without thinking it through , " he says . " But I do n't have a policy job , so it does n't matter what I think . I 'm paid to execute . " <p> That desire to get the job done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion of " just checking the box "  --  a concept that takes in most of what his civilian peers are doing : working 8-hour days , coasting through college . No risk of that in his first tour in Iraq . But after he was injured , there were people who wanted to define him by his wounds , rather than his intention to overcome them . <p> His escape route was Ranger School  --  roughly comparable to rolling out of a feather bed and into a lava bed . Then again , you could forgive Peter Sprenger for seeing something sinister in " safe " locations . <p> As he hurtled toward Ranger School , he had to rebuild an athletic body that had been wasted by post-op bed rest . He followed up months of intensive rehab by blowing through a 50-mile section of the Appalachian Trail  --  in 2 days . <p> He also had to relearn things the rest of us take for granted . " I was in the mess hall , and I set a glass under the soda fountain and pressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass completely . I looked around .. ' Did anybody notice that ? ' " <p> The stakes were higher when he tested himself on the catwalk , a 20-foot-high series of slats and gaps that 's hard enough for those of us with normal depth perception . Sprenger 's training overruled his confused visual cortex : " Doing what you do n't want to do is easier than the hell you 'll pay for not doing it , " he says . " I 'd rather have the broken leg . " So he forged ahead , and survived . That 's one way to compensate . <p> Ranger School consists of three phases : First , at Fort Benning , Georgia , soldiers are broken down with sleep deprivation and lack of food while they complete brutal rounds of physical exercise  --  Sprenger will never forget the correct way to do a pushup . They are drowned , run ragged , pummeled with fists and sticks , jackhammered with tests on military procedure . If they make it through that , it 's on to the mountain phase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens again , going uphill and off cliff . Survive that , and the nightmare recurs during maneuvers in Florida swamps . <p> Of the 411 hardened military men who began training in his class , only 141 made it through . And all the other guys were looking at it through two eyes . <p> Captain Rodney Dycus , a physician assistant in Sprenger 's unit , followed him from wounding to rehab to Ranger School : " Eighty percent of guys with that injury would move on from the army . But the other 20 percent  --  it changes their attitude the other way . None of us ever doubted him . " <p> IT 'S LATE IN THE AFTERNOON IN THE soldiers ' barracks , and Sprenger is rummaging around his room looking for computer parts . If he can meld the components into a functioning computer , he 'll run through a set of images that show exactly what he went through during the car bombing . <p> While rebuilding the system , he talks about his decision to redeploy . " When you first go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing . " His voice is drained of its usual exuberance . " Then the letters slow down . You realize that they 're moving on with their lives , into their own things . Some of their concerns just do n't seem that important . " <p> He had to choose what was most important to him . " I want to be here , to finish the job I signed up to do , " he says . " And because of my Ranger training , I can do more now . I have that drive . It 's who I am . " <p> Suddenly , the computer screen springs to life , and he searches his photo files . Images flash : Camouflaged faces during a training exercise . A picture of Sprenger with a buddy , featuring what he calls , with nostalgia , " my nice two eyes . " Two soldiers flipping off a portrait of Saddam in Baghdad . <p> As he clicks through the next set of images , Sprenger 's voice grows quiet , clipped , as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of the street the suicide bomber drove down , the crater he left , his remains draping like Spanish moss on the headquarters ' rooftop . <p> " I was lucky those doors were open , " Sprenger says , pointing to the front of company headquarters . If the doors had been closed , they would have been reduced to so many flying razor blades hurtling in his direction . " Mostly , the shrapnel missed . " <p> Coolly , he narrates an image that belies his assertion : a wall and floor spattered with his own blood . " You can see where I sat down on the ammo box , and those hand-prints are from when I was reaching around trying to find the radio transmitter . The fine spray on the wall must have been from an artery that was pumping when I stood up . " <p> It 's hard to look at the next image , of Sprenger after the blast . In a bloodred field where a face ought to be , there are two battered and distended eyelids , the smear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed rose . <p> " I have n't looked at these photos for 5 months , " he says . Maybe he 'd rather have let that memory dim . But they 're on the hard drive . They 're part of him now . <p> Corporal Sprenger shrugs off fears that something just as bad , or worse , might befall him upon his return to Iraq : " Hell , it 's dangerous here , " he says , sweeping a hand across the landscape . <p> There is one deep-seated fear he ca n't shake : that he 'll end up wasting his time . But maybe that 's common among men who 've had nothing more than an open door between themselves and death . <p> So he has a plan . " If you want to get things done , sometimes you have to redefine your workday , " he told me . " The 32-hour workday . The 48-hour workday . It 's amazing what you can get done if you 're willing to work like that . " <p> Driving around Fort Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an empty lot . " Those were n't there a week ago , " he notes . " They 're for our deployment . " At first , they seem an ominous sign of troop movements to come . But to Peter Sprenger , they look like a personal promise about to be fulfilled . <p> OVER AN ICED TEA AT A LOCAL joint , Sprenger unfolds a napkin to draw a detailed hierarchical plan of the army , from the commander-in-chief on down . It takes a lot of ink and arrows to reach the guys who actually burst into that roomful of insurgents . And Sprenger will be the first one through that door  --  the point man in a heavily armed wedge of five infantrymen who truly are the tip of the spear . He knows he belongs there . <p> Peter Sprenger does n't want to be thought of as the guy who lost an eye , or even the guy who lost an eye and went back for more . The loss is the least of it . The issue is , can he live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vision reach beyond 50 yards , as far as he can make it go ? GUTS and WORK TRAINING UNDER FIRE <p> " I was never a leader , " says Captain Ryan Sheeran , a few days before being deployed for his second tour in Operation Iraqi Freedom . " But I became one in Iraq . " <p> In March 2003 , less than a year after graduating from the University of Scranton and fresh out of Ranger School , Sheeran was airlifted from Fort Campbell to Kuwait , where he hitched a helicopter ride to his platoon 's location , about 65 miles south of Baghdad . Upon arrival , he learned their mission : Help capture and secure Iraq 's capital city . Although it was a job he 'd spent the previous 8 months training for , this was no ordinary task , even by military standards . " I was brand new , had n't met a single one of my men , and I was about to take them into combat , " he says . Thankfully , the army 's leadership training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our mission went perfectly . " <p> During his tour , Sheeran and his troops patrolled the streets of Baghdad , helped eliminate insurgents in Tal Afar , and set up camp in southeastern Mosul , where they were in charge of protecting a sector of territory that was home to 8,000 Iraqis . For Sheeran , it was a job that involved more than policing the town . " I basically became their ad hoc mayor , " he says , shaking his head at the memory . While fending off rocket and mortar attacks by insurgents , he set up democratic elections , arbitrated civilian disputes , and managed the area 's water supply  --  not exactly textbook duties for a rifle-platoon leader . He was only 23 years old while he did all this , but that was an advantage in a way : He could still remember his civics-class lessons on how a democratic government works . After 11 months in Iraq , Sheeran and all 39 of his men returned home safely  --  an accomplishment he counts among his most important . SET THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect ; no one wants to follow a putz , " says Sheeran . In the army , that means showing your troops that you 're willing to work harder and sacrifice more than anyone else  --  whether it 's carrying a tired soldier 's pack in addition to your own , or being the first person to work in the morning and the last one to leave at night . NEVER BE COMPLACENT <p> " Do n't get too comfortable , " advises Sheeran . It 's up to the leader to ensure that everyone is upholding the standards he sets . " Your men expect you to make sure everyone in the platoon is doing their jobs ; if you do n't , there will be mistakes . " In Iraq , that can cost lives . In the corporate world , it costs jobs . Complacency results in a decline in quality , inferior products , and , ultimately , a loss of revenue . LEARN FROM YOUR MEN <p> " When you take over a unit , your task is to observe and ask questions , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheaval  --  in mass chaos , for example  --  wait 2 to 4 weeks before completing your assessment and installing your own system . " It 's important that you fully understand what they 're doing and why before making any changes . "  --  ADAM CAMPBELL <p> GUTS and FAMILY AN UNBREAKABLE BOND <p> " It 's a fact of life that I may not come home , " says Lieutenant Colonel Skip Johnson , a battalion commander in the army 's 101st Airborne Division . " But I have the peace I need , because my family is taken care of . " Ask the colonel to expand , and it 's clear that the scope of his statement reaches far beyond financial affairs . " They 've got one another , " he says . In September , Johnson , 45  --  a Gulf War veteran and former military aide to Vice President Dick Cheney  --  shipped out for a 1-year deployment to Iraq . He left behind his wife and three sons : two who play college football and another , Micah , who 's a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player in the nation by the Sporting News . It 's a difficult time for the entire family , but right now the spotlight shines brightest on Micah , a 6 ' 2 ? , 265-pound 17-year-old who , in the absence of his father , is trying to choose the right school from among his 40 scholarship offers . " I know Dad would be here if he could , " he says . " My only concern is that he comes back safely . " <p> Colonel Johnson is resolute that he does n't need to be physically present to help Micah with his decision . That 's because he feels he 's done his job as a father , a tour of duty that began 22 years ago with the birth of his first son . " It 's not what you do while you 're away that matters , " he says . " It 's what you do while you 're home . " <p> Here are his prescriptions for how to stay close , no matter where your job takes you . CULTIVATE DISCIPLINE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ' and ' No , sir , ' not just to teach them respect for their elders , but as a simple way to instill discipline , " says Johnson . <p> " Introduce discipline early , especially in little ways that your kids have to practice frequently , and it will help them succeed in every aspect of their lives , whether it 's school , family , athletics , or work . " BE A TEAMMATE <p> " In the army , we use physical training and team-building exercises as a way to create esprit de corps in a unit , and it works the same way to foster relationships in a family , " he says . Instead of being only a spectator , participate with your kids by regularly jogging or playing sports with them . " As the years pass , you 'll have great memories to look back on . " GO FISH <p> For Johnson , building a strong family unit begins with the most basic elements of life . " My wife and I taught the boys how to fish when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day , it 's something all of us enjoy doing together , and it gives us a special connection , " he says . The colonel believes that connection  --  whether it be fishing , basketball , or even backyard wrestling  --  has helped create enduring bonds among the whole family , which means Dad is n't the only one they can lean on . " While he 's gone , I 'm looking after Mom , " says Micah . " We 're all taking care of each other . "  --  A.C. <p> GUTS and SUCCESS PREPARE FOR ANYTHING <p> Men who put their lives on the line approach their jobs very differently than most civilians . Servicemen are meticulous , deliberate , and uniform  --  across all ranks and platoons . If they 're not , their coworkers  --  fellow soldiers  --  lose their lives . Use their shared insight to expand yours , without putting yourself in harm 's way . REPEAT AFTER US <p> " We learn in marksmanship training that it takes 2,000 repetitions to make a reaction natural , " says Jason Dodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his third tour in Iraq . " That amount of work allows you to perform a duty flawlessly , without having to think about it . " The key is to make the unusual routine  --  the extraordinary  --  ordinary . Apply his strategy in your own life by using this classic advice from Earl Nightingale , the man who founded the self-help industry in the 1950s : Read for an hour a day  --  about 4 percent of your week  --  in any subject that you want to master . In 3 years ' time , you 'll be an expert in the field . PLAN YOUR ESCAPE <p> Lieutenant Jonathan Walden , 24 , an executive officer serving his second yearlong tour in Iraq , disengages by lifting weights . " After I come back from patrol , I head to the gym , put on my headphones , and get lost , " he says . It 's no commercial health club : " We had locals pour the plates for us  --  none of them weigh the same , the bar is always lop-sided , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all that is secondary . It 's downtime from stress , and if it works after a life-threatening day on the streets of Baghdad , it 'll be even more effective in Dallas , Des Moines , and Seattle . And here 's proof : University of Alabama researchers found that men who lifted weights regularly for 6 months experienced lower levels of tension and anger , and were in a better overall mood , than before they participated in the iron game . THINK BIG PICTURE <p> In the army , directives from the boss are called orders , and they have to be followed . " If I do n't agree with an order , I have to recognize that I 'm working on less information than the people above me , " says Lieutenant Chris Sundell , 24 , an infantry officer who was deployed to Iraq in September . " The right decision from my vantage point could be the wrong decision for accomplishing our overall objective . " By asking your boss what other factors are in play , you 'll impress him with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make yourself a more valuable employee .  --  A.C. <p> THE SPECIAL-OPS CHALLENGE : HOW FIT ARE YOU ? <p> Even if you 're not ready to sign up , it helps to be fighting fit . Test yourself against Ranger standards , using their recommended scores in pushups , situps , chinups , and a 2-mile run . Fall below the curve ? Follow the accompanying training techniques from Michael Mejia , C.S.C.S. , author of the Special Ops Workout . Do each 2 or 3 days a week , resting at least a day between sessions . PUSHUPS THE RANGER GOAL : 80 IN 2 MINUTES <p> If you do n't measure up : Do as many pushups as you can , then rest for 20 seconds . Repeat this back-and-forth process ( work , rest ) for 2 minutes . Keep track of the total number of pushups you perform in that time period , and try to beat it in your next workout . SITUPS THE RANGER GOAL : 80 IN 2 MINUTES <p> If you do n't measure up : Without resting , do as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish . Then rest for that same amount of time . Repeat four times , always resting for only as long as it took to do your previous set . Work your way to the 2-minute goal . CHINUPS THE RANGER GOAL : 12 OR MORE <p> If you do n't measure up : Take the most chinups you can do at one time , and divide that number in half . Now perform sets of that number of repetitions  --  resting 60 seconds after each set  --  until you 've done at least 12 chinups . ( If you can do six chinups , you 'll perform four sets of three repetitions . ) Each workout , reduce your rest between sets by 5 seconds , until you 're down to zero rest and able to do 12 consecutive chinups. 2-MILE RUN THE RANGER GOAL : 13 MINUTES OR LESS <p> If you do n't measure up : Break the 2-mile distance into 400-yard increments ( mile , or once around the track ) and do eight intervals , running each in 1 minute , 38 seconds  --  a pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 60 seconds after each . Each workout , reduce your rest period by 5 to 10 seconds until you can do all eight 400-yard rounds without stopping .  --  A.C. <p> <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Corporal Peter Sprenger lost an eye in Iraq .
