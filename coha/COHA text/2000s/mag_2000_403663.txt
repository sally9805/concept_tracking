There was a time when my son seemed to have only two words in his vocabulary : " No ! " and " Juice ! " Both words tumbled out of his two-year-old mouth with the same sense of dire urgency . When Nicholas awoke , it was " Juice ! " Mid-morning , it was " Juice ! " And so on throughout each busy day . I found myself pouring little plastic cups of juice like a mindless robot , until one day I stopped to take stock . My cute little juice-aholic was knocking back more than 24 ounces of the sweet stuff a day . No wonder his other favourite word came my way every time I asked him to sit down and eat . Juice , like many good things , is best in moderation . Too much of it can lead to a surprising array of problems . The wake-up call for many health-care professionals was a study , published in a 1994 issue of Pediatrics , revealing that excessive juice consumption in toddlers could actually lead to failure to thrive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many parents , is the relationship between juice drinking and picky eating . This phenomenon has been witnessed in detail by William Wilkoff , author of Coping with a Picky Eater , who points to a problem he calls " the juice deception . " " Juice is better than soft drinks , " writes Wilkoff in his book , " but it is easy to get too much , particularly in a bottle , and it displaces important nutritious components of the child 's diet . ... In my pediatric nutrition clinic days , more often than not , I would find toddlers were drinking way too much juice  --  sometimes as much as 24 ounces a day . " That amount far exceeds the Canadian Paediatric Society ( CPS ) recommendation that children from six to 24 months drink no more than four to six ounces ( 125 to 200 mL ) a day , and children two to 12 years old drink no more than eight to 12 ounces ( 250 to 375 mL ) a day . In other words , parents should limit juice intake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer juice more often than not , " says Lorry Chen , a Toronto dietitian . " Kids love juice and will ask for it , again and again . Most parents are n't even aware that overconsumption is an issue . They think it 's nutritious ... so why not offer it all the time ? " That 's the catch : Juice is nutritious . Most varieties are excellent sources of vitamin C. Depending on the type , juice can also supply folate , potassium  --  even vitamin A and calcium . It 's fat-free , easy to digest , has no additives and is all natural . Yet despite all of its attributes , juice is high in calories and does fill up tiny tummies quickly . If your little guy is feeling satiated from a juice bottle , chances are he wo n't want his Pablum . If babies and toddlers are filling up on the sweet liquid , they might routinely refuse solid foods , which may lead to anemia . There 's another concern . Too much juice  --  especially apple or pear juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diarrhea . Different than infectious diarrhea , toddler 's diarrhea occurs when too much sorbitol and fructose enter the digestive tract . " These sugars are not broken down easily in a young child 's digestive system , " explains Doris Yuen , chairperson of the CPS Nutrition Committee , " and as a result , water actually leaks into the gut , causing diarrhea . " The other type of diarrhea  --  caused by gastrointestinal infections  --  can be compounded , warns Yuen , if a child drinks juice . While the old school of medical thought was to prescribe " clear fluids " for gastrointestinal infections and flu-related diarrhea , doctors now recommend that children take electrolyte rehydration solutions , such as Pedialyte , and avoid apple juice . Another place to avoid juice is in a bottle . When children drink juice from a bottle , teeth are in constant contact with sugary liquids , wreaking havoc with dental health . According to Burton Conrod , a Sydney , Nova Scotia dentist and president-elect of the Canadian Dental Association , children who spend a lot of time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking around  --  are at risk of suffering from severe tooth decay ( unless , of course , that bottle is filled with water ) . Thus it is better to drink juice from a bottle , cup , sippy cup or juice box in a single sitting rather than throughout the day , to limit the contact time between teeth and sweet fluids . The best place for babies to get their first taste of juice is from a cup . That 's what Darlynn Harmison of Bourget , Ontario chose to do with her six-month-old daughter . " Courtney was still nursing exclusively and I figured , " Why introduce a bottle , then take it away ? ' ' " she says . " Besides , I had read about the risk of dental caries with a juice bottle . " Harmison started Courtney with diluted apple juice since she did n't want her daughter 's palate to become accustomed to the sweetness of full- strength juice . ( The CPS says it 's fine to offer pure , undiluted fruit juice to babies , but does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months old . ) Now Courtney is 18 months old , and her mother limits her juice intake to four ounces ( 125 mL ) a day . " I fill her sippy cup every day , and if she does n't finish it when it 's served , she can finish it later , " explains Harmison . " But I 'll always offer her water or milk first . I know that there 's vitamin C in her juice , but I 'd rather she got more nutrients from whole fruit . " The only time Harmison will break down and offer extra juice to her daughter is during a heat wave . " When it 's really hot out and the temperature is up in the 30s , I do get concerned about dehydration , " she says . " If juice is all she 'll take , that 's what I 'll give her . " Since most juice hounds complain loudly when parents try to cut back , it 's wise to do so gradually , perhaps over a month . Reduce the actual serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from concentrate is easier to water down ( without kids noticing ) than juice from a can . When a dedicated juice-drinker witnesses his beverage getting a shot of water from a faucet , the success rate is sure to plummet . But if you dilute canned juice and store it in a pitcher , who 's to know ? Another trick for children over three is to serve one or two frozen-juice ice cubes in a glass of water . You can jazz up the cubes by adding a slice of strawberry or a few blueberries . Of course , it makes better sense to serve juice judiciously , right from the get-go . If kids under two get a cup in a high chair , then wandering with bottles is prevented . If you instill some structure , such as , " We only serve it at breakfast " or " Here 's your daily juice snack , " then the all-day habit never starts . Donna Green of Toronto remembers when her daughter , Stella , was two and a confirmed juice-aholic . " When she was hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . So I started a no-juice policy during mealtimes to ensure a balanced meal . " It worked . Stella , now nine , is still an avid drinker . " The difference nowadays is that if she 's hungry , she 'll take a steamy bowl of soup over a glass of juice , hands down . She 's kicked the habit , so to speak . " <p>
