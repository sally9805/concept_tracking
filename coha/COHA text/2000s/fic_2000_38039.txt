HER MAID GAVE A LAST TUG to Xian Xi-Qing 's robes of faux silk and rolled away . Stiffly seated on a throne of pale poured marble , the ancient Controller stared down the long hall and tried to resemble a goddess without feeling much like one . <p> Once she had actually felt unshakable , but no longer . The Crux conspiracy had frightened her badly . Fanatics , invading the past to prevent the Time of Troubles , the disaster that created the present world . Who could have believed it ? <p> Her tiny hands clutched each other , stilling a tremor . Ah , thought Xian , what good is all this stem-cell replacement therapy if you lose your courage , if you age inside ? I never used to feel I needed protectors . But now ... have I found the man to protect me , protect our world ? <p> Goldleafed doors at the end of the hall swung open and a tall , heavy man of Japanese ancestry strode forward , each step covering a precise meter of polished floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine censers burning faux ambergris could not cover . <p> Yamashita halted , bowed . His face was like a brick , his head like sandpaper . The huge , ill-smelling , heavily armed beasts looked over his back , ready to destroy him or anybody else if Xian gave the kill signal . But she said only , " Rise , Honored Chief of Security . " <p> With his friend the Worldsaver , this man had destroyed Crux . He was the logical candidate for the job , and yet .... His predecessor had betrayed her . She 'd attended the faithless Kathmann 's shosho , his interrogation , though she hated the stinks and screaming of the White Chamber . With the needles in his spine he 'd confessed everything- the Chief of Security a traitor ! <p> She 'd heard him with her own ears , and though she would never admit it to anyone , at that moment fear had become her companion . <p> " General , extraordinary measures of security are needed , " she began her instructions to Yamashita . " We trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're quite insignificant . But here at home , ah here at home .... <p> Her hands were trembling again . " Suppose someone builds another wormholes ? " she almost pleaded . " We know now that it 's possible ; we know that terrorists exist ready to destroy themselves if they can destroy this world of ours ! Can we ever be secure again ? " <p> Yamashita needed his marmolitz , his marble face . He 'd expected a mere formal welcome to his new job . And here the Controller was demanding an answer to an unanswerable question . <p> Luckily , he was quick-wilted . <p> " Honored Controller , " he intoned , " I have given this problem much thought . " <p> He paused - gave it the only thought he 'd ever given it - then continued , " There is only one way . A new wormholes must be built under the control of the Security Forces . Reliable people must be trained to journey through time . " <p> He paused , astonished at his own chutzpah , then thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only in this way can our world be secure ! " <p> Xian thought : What a marvelous bureaucrat . Imagine , working all this out ahead of time , then demanding such an immense responsibility , knowing what will happen to him if he fails ! <p> She looked with new confidence into his face , seemingly impervious to heat , cold and pity . She nodded , extending a hand so thin the fingers looked like tiny sticks from a bird 's nest . A magpie 's nest , each finger stacked with glinting rings of dull gold and green jade . <p> " Your proposal is approved . Succeed , General , and three hundred inhabited worlds will praise you . Fail - " <p> She let the word hang in midair , as Rathmann had hung toward the end of his interrogation , when the skills of Colonel Yost and the technicians of the White Chamber had made his treason clear . Then she said abruptly , " Honored Chief of Security , we permit you to go . " <p> In his big new office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawled back in a tall chair of black duroplast . His thick fingers drummed on the desktop , a massive slab of Martian petrified wood , a hundred million years old if it was a day . <p> He was thinking : What the fuck . I deserve all this . <p> Thirty years it had taken him to get here . Thirty years since those faroff days in the Security Forces Academy when he revealed his ambition to his friend , Cadet Steffens Aleksandr . <p> " You watch me , Stef . One day I 'll be the fucking Chief of Security . " " Why would you want to be ? " <p> A typical Stef answer . The man who had become a cop without believing the basic truths of cophood . <p> " Because , asshole , that 's where the power is . " <p> " And the problems . And the danger of losing your head . " <p> Yamashita smiled , stretched . Stef had gone on to become the Worldsaver , more or less by accident . By plunging into the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pal Yama was alive in the present , and just where he wanted to be . <p> " Secretary ! " he barked . Obediently , a large mashing whose memory was stocked with the world 's most elaborate encryption software rose from a well in the floor . <p> " Yes , Honored General ? " <p> " Get me Yost . " <p> An instant later a prickle of laser beams created the illusion of a long , sad-looking , intellectual face hovering in the mashina 's shadowbox . <p> " I 'm officially in . So here 's a few things for you to get started on . First , find the White Chamber new quarters . It 's too small and the electrical system is antiquated . Also , change its name . It 's got a lousy reputation . Call it , um , Special Investigations . " <p> " You are n't abolishing shosho ? " asked Yost , alarmed . <p> " Great Tao , no . " Neither man could imagine running a proper criminal justice system without physical methods . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a new wormholes . Kathmann executed the guys who built the last one , so you 'll have to assemble a new team . We 'll need young , strong , expendable people to do the time traveling . It 's no game for old farts . " <p> " Chief , this is all damned expensive . Where 's the money to come from ? " <p> " Do n't worry , I know where a lot of bodies are buried . I 'll squeeze the Senate . But for a start , we can economize . The budget of the Penal Moons is way out of line . Release all offenders who 've served ten years or more if they 're fully rehabilitated . Execute those who are n't . " <p> " Will do . " <p> No order bothered Yost . He 'd survived Kathmann and intended to survive Yamashita as well . <p> " In case anybody complains about any of my policies , " Yamashita finished , " you 're the designated motherfucker , understand ? I set people free while you cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run Special Investigations . When you follow me into this office , you can mistreat your deputy the way I intend to mistreat you . Understood ? " <p> " Yes , Honored General , " sighed Yost , and his image evaporated . Yamashita reared back in his chair and the boyish grin returned to his usually stolid face . He was going to enjoy his new job . A little mosh power in Alspeke , the only language that all humans understood - was a pain in the butt . Ask poor old Yost . <p> But a lot was heaven . <p> On the nearby campus of the University of the Universe , a knot of students gathered in the warm Siberian sun around a kiosk plastered with job announcements . <p> " Great Tao , " said one . " Timesurfing . How 's that for a job ? " <p> " Tailbuster , " said another . " Beta test scores , alfa fitness , SECRET/ BEHEADER clearance ! " <p> Most of them drifted on . One who did n't was a tall , solid-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the announcement 's boxcode into it . <p> " Gon na apply , Maks ? " asked another . <p> " Why note Nothing to lose . " <p> Hastings Maks would not have dreamed of admitting how excited he felt . He loved history , loved finding out how things really happened . To explore the actual past sounded too good to be true . <p> And to do it under the leadership of General Yamashita-the security chief who 'd gained everyone 's love by closing the White Chamber and opening the doors of the prisons . Why , hardly a day went by without the news programs showing some tearful ex-convict returning home to his weeping family . Nobody in Ulanor the Worldcity was more popular than this strong man , who kept society in order through justice , not cruelty ! <p> Next morning Maks woke up and faced reality . He was not exceptional in any way , mental or physical , and the likelihood that he could get into an elite program was small . But he was bold enough to defy the odds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He called the boxcode from his parents ' mashing and registered for the first test - a grueling athletic trial called the Fizikal . <p> For the next month he was up before dawn every morning , working out in the campus gymnasium with the young men and women who would be his competitors . He deliberately chose the best of them to test himself against - for wrestling , a strong young Mongol with the torso of a lion ; for running , a woman offworlder named Zo Lian . <p> Lian was definitely odd . Though human , she 'd been genetically adjusted to her homeworld , Beta Charonis ; her bones looked almost delicate but her muscles were long , tireless strings . Her chest - intended for use in air with a lower oxygen content than Earth - was a barrel ; her breasts small , bound for exercise by an elastic bandage . <p> Lian told Maks that the only thing remarkable about her planet , aside from its rich lodes of metals and natural radioactives , was the fact that the ill-smelling , ferocious creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived on Earth and saw a platoon of them guarding the Palace of Justice with whips and guns , " she said wryly , " I felt at home right away . " <p> Ambitious , she 'd worked her way to Earth on a freighter , won a stipend to study at the University , then applied for the surfer program . Maks found her too strange to be desirable , but he admired her guts and her prowess as an effortless , tireless runner . If he could keep up with Lian , he could keep up with anybody . <p> After working out in the gym , they put on thin coveralls with cooling units and set out , running through the outskirts of the city and up the dry Butaeliyn Hills in the metallic dust of summer . Invariably , Lian led the way , Maks puffing behind with the heels of her ragged old running shoes flickering like little mirages ahead of him . <p> One day after a ten or twelve-click run they stopped to rest and drink at a cold spring . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles quivering , his lungs burning as he gasped for air . Even Lian had found the long uphill run tough ; she propped her skinny arms against her knees , lungs working like bellows . <p> When her racing pulse had quieted she walked unsteadily to the spring and knelt down . Maks joined her and they drank side by side like two weary animals . Then sat quietly on the ground and looked at each other . <p> Lian had a laconic , flat way of talking . <p> " We 'll both get into the program , " she predicted . " I 'll make the first cut and you 'll make the second or third . " <p> " You know , you 've got just the slightest touch of arrogance , Lian . " She plucked a stalk of dun grass and thoughtfully picked her long white teeth . At such moments she looked subtly unhuman , all her proportions just a trifle off the earthside norm . The fact that she had amber eyes heightened the near-alien effect . <p> " Not really . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a fact . But I 've watched you almost kill yourself working out , Maks . You 'll make it on guts alone . " <p> That was the most encouraging thing he 'd heard yet . As his breathing quieted , scenes from the past formed in his mind . He saw China 's First Emperor dip his writing brush to order the building of the Great Wall . He saw a troop of Crusaders ride down a dusty road in Anatolia , chain mail chinking like a pocketful of half-khan pieces . He saw naked whores dancing in the Red Room of the White House while one of the Decadent Presidents looked on , grinning and munching toasted pork rinds . <p> The past , the incomparable past , made up of so many presents forever lost , now regained . <p> Suddenly his fatigue was gone . Like a boy he took out his excitement by jumping Lian . For a few seconds they rolled over and over in the dust like playful puppies . This was one place where Maks 's weight mattered ; he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . Her strange eyes stared up at him , bright as burning amber . <p> Embarrassed , he jumped up , helped her to her feet . They brushed each other off . <p> " Timesurfing-it 's the only life , is n't it ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , " said Lian , " there is no other , " and began to trot down the mountain , leading the way as usual . <p> THAT SAME SUMMER - not that Earth 's seasons meant anything in the tunnels of the penal moon Calisto - Convict Ya7326 prepared for the end of his term of imprisonment . <p> Sentenced for life , he now had a chance to be set free after only twenty years . Like all the men and women who dwelt in the tunnels , he was bald and muscular . Convicts were routinely depilated for hygienic reasons , and work at the Near Space Refueling Depot , for which the penal colony supplied labor , made you either strong or dead . <p> Inwardly Ya7326 was exceptionally intelligent , though his prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liquid nitrogen storage tanks had given him little chance to prove it . <p> As the " day " approached ( days were marked by fluctuations in the automatic lighting ) he seemed absolutely unaware of the coming change . Until a robot guard called him to the Out-Processing Unit , he continued to make up his bunk , work in the tunnels , eat every mouthful of food allowed him - in short , to obey each and every one of the 92 Rules of Conduct he 'd learned on arrival . <p> After receiving a total radial scan to make sure he would n't carry diseases back to civilization , he reported to the psychiatrist 's office . He sat down on a battered duroplast bench and waited without fidgeting . Memories passed through his mind . <p> His arrest and his time in the White Chamber would be with him as long as he lived . He 'd run an identity-counterfeiting ring connected with the maf ya and had spent a long time with the needles in his spinal marrow , screaming and twisting , his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Kathmann had entered the room - a short man with a fat neck , pointed head , and glinting plastic eyes . He sounded impatient as he said to the techs , " You 've got all the juice out of this kukrach . Do n't waste any more time on him . " <p> Kukrach meant cockroach . <p> So he survived the White Chamber and became Ya7326 and traveled to Calisto in a freighter 's hold . There things got rough again . He still remembered the blinding headache that followed insertion of his control chip and the little explosive sphere of synthetic neurotoxin . Then later in his cell , trying despite the headache to memorize the Rules of Conduct . <p> Breaking any of the first 12 ( lack of neatness in the cell , failure of personal hygiene , etc. ) brought punishment by hunger . Breaking the next 21 meant hunger plus sensory deprivation for Longer or shorter periods . Breaking any of the other 59 rules brought death , which was so easy : a program running on the mainframe in Central Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent a signal , and a prisoner keeled over , untouched by human hands . <p> At first Ya7326 could n't believe the prison authorities were serious , that there could be so many reasons to die . Then they began culling the new prisoners . First to go were the double-Y-chromosome types . He was glad of that - scary guys , good riddance . Then the incurably disruptive . A woman convict who threw wastewater on a robot guard in an attempt to short it out went down like a poleaxed cow within a meter of him and the guard dragged her away by the ankles . <p> Yet Ya7326 had survived the culling , too . Why ? he often asked himself . Was he reserved for some great destiny ? Life in the tunnels gave him endless time to think about such profound and basic questions . <p> A light blinked above the door and Ya7326 got up , neither hurrying nor lagging even though he knew that for him , the critical moment was at hand . If he was judged rehabilitated , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , he would die like that woman , even now , even after twenty years . <p> " Well , " the psychiatrist greeted him , " I see we have another candidate for release . Why should we set you free , Ya73Z6 ? " <p> " I feel that I 'm ready to regain my freedom . Suffering has purified my inner self . I 've had no demerits at all for the past five years . " <p> The psychiatrist - a black box - checked his record and confirmed his claims . <p> " That is very satisfactory , Ya7326 . Your cell sensors report no rulebreaking activities of any kind , and that is also good . Have you reflected on the errors that brought you to Calisto ? " <p> " Yes , " he said , " I often think about those errors . " <p> Now they were getting to the heart of the matter . For the interview Ya7326 sat in a senzit , a chair that monitored a variety of physical reactions . The senzit was part of the psychiatrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's past mistakes is a prerequisite to sound action in the future , " it intoned . " Do you agree ? " <p> Ya7326 had often noticed that black boxes were even more tiresomely moralistic than humans . <p> " Emphatically , Doctor , I do agree . " <p> " Do you blame yourself or others for your crime of counterfeiting identities ? " <p> " I blame no one but myself . " <p> " Very good , " said the box , after checking his reactions . " Now , this is a question you will need to answer with perfect honesty . Your answer will be noted purely for medical purposes and will not be reported to the prison authorities . " <p> Despite everything , he felt increased tension that he knew the box was reading from the senzit . Of course it was lying - everything would be reported . <p> " Do you desire revenge against the authorities who subjected you to shosho and later sent you to prison ? " <p> Ya7326 took a few seconds to compose himself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I admit to hating General Kathmann , who ordered my shosho . But he 's dead . I have no desire whatever to become the kind of contemptible criminal I used to be . I do n't want to harm any human individual . " <p> A few silent seconds passed . Then the psychiatrist said , " Your involuntary reactions and brainwave patterns , Ya7326 , indicate that you have spoken the truth as you see it . It can therefore be said that your rehabilitation is complete . " <p> Next day Ya7326 was sitting on the examining table in the dispensary , waiting for the surgeon to appear . A locked instrument cabinet stood in front of him ; he looked at his reflection in the mirror duroplast and smiled , thinking of the psych interview . How stupid black boxes were ! <p> No , he had no desire to commit again the acts he 'd been convicted of . If he had to commit them in furtherance of his plan , he would . But he had no desire to . <p> Yes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his godlike self for the trivial rewards of petty crime . No , he wanted no revenge on any human individual . <p> He turned as the door opened . The surgeon bustled in , washed his hands at a little sink on the wall , and prepared for business . <p> " Had your mediscan ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " Psych interview ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " Ready to go , then ? " <p> " Definitely , sir . " <p> " Lie on your stomach . This will hurt a little , even with the local anesthetic - the back of the neck has so many nerves in it . " <p> " I do n't mind pain , " said Ya 7326 , truthfully . <p> During imprisonment his pain threshold had risen so high that he could hold his fingers in an open flame , smelling the flesh bum but feeling hardly a sting . It was part of the transition he 'd undergone in the tunnels , an aspect of his entry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and closed his eyes . <p> The first day of the Fizikal was devoted to gymnasium sports . Maks got along well enough , and Lian did splendidly until the candidates paired off far wrestling . <p> Then the powerful young Mongol who used to wrestle /and invariably throw/ Maks sprang into the circle with Lian , seized her around her slender waist and with one violent contraction of the arms broke her back . <p> Maks , horrified , rode with Lian to the hospital . A few centuries in the past so serious a spinal cord injury would have meant permanent paralysis . Now it meant an operation to replace the damaged section with nerve fibers from genetically altered embryo monkeys . Then it meant lying in bed for months , waiting for the regeneration to be complete , followed by more months of therapy to restore full function . <p> Maks paid as many visits to Lian as he could . But the first year of the timesurfer program - he 'd barely made the third cut after screwing up a math exam-was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take it . When Maks did visit the hospital he felt guilty to be talking about his progress . <p> " Now they 're taping me with archaic English , " he said . " It 's pretty easy ; after all , I know the modern dialect . At least I get a chance to sleep while the mashina 's on . Aside from that it 's run , run , run all the time . " <p> Lian sighed . As of today she 'd been looking at the ceiling of the hospital room for seventy-three days . She knew every crack in the paint by heart . <p> " It 'll take me forever to get back in shape , " she muttered . <p> " I 'll help you . " <p> " You 're a dear friend , Maks , but you wo n't have time . " <p> That was true . The harder truth was that Lian 's injury made things easier for Maks . One competitor less - and a tough one , at that . <p> " It 's just something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lying in bed she looked pale and yellowish . Her face had gone wan and ascetic and her normally thin body was a sack of bones . Maks was sitting in a chair by the bed , sleek with muscles , glowing with health . <p> " Well , I 'll be back as soon as I can , " he said . He pressed her hand , and it felt like a fossil . <p> Maks meant what he said , but in fact he did not go back to the hospital . He was too busy . The place was too depressing . People his age were not supposed to be left broken and helpless . He felt guilty about not going , but not guilty enough to go . Instead , he celebrated his twentieth birthday with his first trip through the wormholes- just a year to the day after the Fizik6l that had been so disastrous for Lian . <p> Miniaturization had reduced the device to a cylinder encircled by two rings : the first held the gravitron accelerator , the second massive electromagnets wrapped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when gigawatts of energy were poured in . Behind a shield , techs watched the monitors of the mashina that ran the show . <p> " Recite the Standing Order ! " demanded Maklixan , a red-haired tech with an ugly face and an irritating manner . <p> " ' The past is not to be changed in any manner , however slight . No one can tell what effect a change may have upon the present . If I have to choose between changing the past and destroying myself , I must destroy myself . " ' <p> " Let 's go then . I do n't have all day . " <p> Carrying a small hand control to signal for his return , Maks relaxed and listened to the hum of the metal slide that carried him into the cylinder . He adjusted opaque goggles over his eyes to prevent retinal damage , and felt rather than saw the intense flash of light that marked the Big Bang-like burst of photons created by the sudden torsion of spacetime . <p> He removed the goggles . He was lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got up and noted the time recorded by the clock on the wall:1534.6/7/2465 . A year had been subtracted . The door of the " receiver room , " as they called it , was locked and sealed shut to prevent accidental contacts between now and then . But a square window , said to be mirrored on the outside , gave him his first sight of the living past . <p> For long minutes he stared down with some unsayable emotion at the world of a year ago - then saw something that almost stopped his heart . Lian , carrying a gym bag , was hurrying toward the Fizik6l . Waiting for her , Maks knew , was the Mongol wrestler . <p> Suddenly Maks found himself beating on the window , trying to attract Lian 's attention , trying to cry a warning . But she hastened past , disappeared from Maks 's angle of vision . Maks put his face into his hands . More time passed before he could pull himself together sufficiently to press the control and return to his own time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still pale and shaken . With a superior smile on his ugly face , the tech remarked , " Assholes never learn . " <p> One sandy eyebrow was raised ; the tech seemed to be enjoying some joke that he alone understood . Maks suddenly realized that the path to the gym did n't go anywhere near the receiver room . <p> The " window " had n't been a window at all ; the scene had been a mashing-generated image . In an instant his grief turned to blinding rage : " You fucking bastard , " he gasped . " I ought to kill you . " <p> " If you do , " the tech said coolly , " you 'll never be a timesurfer . Incidentally , this was a test . You flunked it . " <p> Maks stared at him , his hands clasping and unclasping . Then he slammed out of the room . <p> For the whole of the ten-day week that followed , Maks waited to hear he 'd been plowed in . But nobody said anything ; gradually he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were expected to fail the first time . <p> Nevertheless , the experience had reminded him of Lian . One evening he looked her up . Since her discharge from the hospital , Lian had been living in a dormitory for offworld students at the University . The room , painted sickish green , was crowded with six folding beds and fragrant with moldy towels . <p> But Lian was looking better , as if the environment did n't touch her . She smiled , tried to make Maks welcome . She wore shapeless overalls that sagged as if there was no body inside . <p> " I 've started exercising again , but it 's tough , " she admitted . " I run half a click and get winded . Still , I 'm hoping to apply again in the fall . " You 'll never make it , thought Maks , somehow forgetting that he had succeeded by grit alone . <p> " I wish you luck , " he said and put on what he hoped was an encouraging smile . He took her hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd , he would have kissed her , out of sheer pity . <p> Ulanor , the Worldcity , the capital of the human species , the arena where people struggled for boundless wealth and mosh , was blast about visitors , even important ones . Heroes of the alien wars in Far Space returned to find themselves forgotten ; offworld senators were ignored . <p> Perhaps no visitor had ever been as thoroughly overlooked as the former Ya7326 . He reached Luna as he 'd left it , in a freighter 's hold . He dozed in the shuttle port until an empty seat came up and he could be thumbed aboard . <p> But at least he arrived back in the city of his birth carrying a passport with his convict ID exed out . He was now Vray Dak , the name under which he 'd been arrested two decades before . <p> His first duty was to report to the polizi in the ziggurat Palace of Justice and sign in , giving his current address . Then he spent an hour walking the hard , polished corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Great Unifier of Humankind , Genghis Khan . Such as : " He who breaks my law will vanish like an arrow among reeds . " <p> A recovered arrow , he ventured downstairs , the level of the former White Chamber . Now it held the offices of a small Security Forces agency . When a guard frowned at him , Vray apologized and departed . <p> He loitered for a time outside the building , standing by a trirad stand so that he 'd seem to be waiting for a vehicle if anybody challenged him . In fact , nobody did - he was a casual , slouching figure , a bit overweight as a result of gorging himself on non-prison food . The only remarkable thing about him was his wig , cheap and often askew , that gave his head a faintly comic appearance . Some passersby smiled at him , and he smiled back . <p> Next day he found a legitimate job with the Water and Waste Monopoly , operating an autominer similar to the ones used on Calisto . He worked there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polizi . By then he 'd made contact with some other graduates of what the underworld called Kalist'akad , Calisto Academy . With rnafya help , he quit his job and entered the city 's trade in stolen goods . <p> He was cool and cunning and seemed to draw on boundless supplies of energy , going sometimes for four or five days without sleep . A year of effort made him fairly prosperous . <p> With money in his pocket , he adopted new hobbies . He obtained a portable holographer , bought a license and began to appear on streets around Ulanor , taking people 's pictures against projected 3D backdrops for a silver half-khan . One of his favorite posts was outside the Palace of Justice . <p> " So , " said a guard who recognized him . " Got a new line ? " <p> " Yes , sir . In business for myself , you see . " <p> " Lemme see your license . " <p> The license checked out . Rather reluctantly - he would have liked to run the bugger in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Quit your job digging sewers ? " <p> " Well , sir , after youve lived underground for twenty years , it 's nice to work where you can see the sky . " <p> " Making a living ? " <p> " Scraping by , sir . " <p> " Well ... watch your ass . " ' <p> " Always , sir . " <p> By offering free samples , Vray managed to capture the likeness of a number of civilian employees of the small agency that occupied the former White Chamber . Then he disappeared from the street . <p> If anyone had been interested , they might have found him at home in an apartment he 'd rented in the Clouds and Rain District - the redlight district , named for a poetic Chinese description of intercourse , the " play of clouds and rain . " <p> He spent much of his time staring at a stolen mashing he 'd kept for his own use . He was studying an interactive book called The Glorious Language : Archaic English for Beginners . He read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mythology , memorizing stories of forgotten gods . He was fascinated by a book called America in Decline : The Decadent Presidents , enough so that he and the prosts at the cheap brothels he frequented tried out some of the games the decadent presidents had played . <p> Vray Dak had become a successful minor criminal , an autodidact and a self-made bore . That was how they knew him in the District ; outside it , few people knew him at all . <p> Lian had astonished Maks by passing the entrance test , including the Fizikal , though just barely-thirty-six candidates were admitted and her class number was thirty-five . But that was only the beginning . <p> Slowly she 'd made her way forward . At the end of her first year she stood twenty-first in a class that resignations and failures had reduced to twenty-nine . In her second year , Lian cracked the midpoint : twelfth out of twenty-four . <p> When she came to Maks 's graduation , she was almost unrecognizable : a third-year student , confident of her future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amber eyes . Her class standing was now sixth out of twenty . Maks 's final standing had been seventeenth in his own class of nineteen men and women . <p> " You see , " Lian told him at the end of Maks 's graduation ceremony , when they embraced amid a crowd of well-wishers . <p> " If you had n't been injured , " Males admitted , " my class standing would 've been eighteenth . " <p> " That 's true , it would have been . " <p> Males laughed helplessly at this blunt immodesty . But it was hard to be offended by the truth . After three years of training Lian made him think of a steel string on some strange instrument , perfectly tuned , perfectly taut . <p> She still did n't attract him , but she fascinated him . In spite of everything - her injury , her offworld birth , her poverty - he could see now that she was one of fate 's darlings , possessing a bit more of every talent than most people could ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said honestly , " I 'm lucky to know you . " <p> " Yes , my dear friend , " she answered gravely , " you are . " <p> ON HIS POSTGRADUATION leave Maks took a girlfriend to Antartica for the summer skiing . On his return he reported to the grim step-pyramid of the Palace of Justice and entered , brushing past a fleshy man in a wig to reach the guard station . <p> Pastplor , the Office for the Exploration of the Past , had been operating for only five years - the new kid on the bureaucratic block , distrusted by the uniformed thuggi whose idea of policing did not include time travel . <p> Males had Pastplor 's status forcefully brought home to him when he realized that its offices were on the first level underground , in space formerly occupied by the White Chamber of infamous memory . <p> Searching for the right room , he walked down soundproofed corridors lined with small tiled cubicles and an occasional larger room . The steel doors were gone and desks had taken the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow punishment cells now imprisoned only brooms and mops , ceilings had been painted sky blue , and there were no Darksiders about . <p> Yet Maks felt anxious and oppressed . He did n't need this atmosphere for his first day on the job . <p> Eventually - after asking twenty or so people and getting nineteen wrong answers - he found the room where his orientation was to take place . At once he relaxed . it was full of his friends and Maks forgot his first impressions of the place in happy gossip about how everyone had wasted the summer just past . <p> Then a black box at the front of the classroom beeped them to attention . <p> " What , " it demanded , " are the Authorized Uses of the Past ? " <p> The young surfers took out recorder disks , warmed them between their hands and started taking notes . <p> " The first , " said the box , answering itself , " is to maintain everlasting vigil against criminals like the Crux conspirators . <p> " The second , newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions to questions of scientific importance . " <p> Maks now learned that weather stations the size of grains of sand had been sent to a variety of times and locations to build up a reliable picture of temperature variations for the last 100,000 years . These tiny globules stuffed with nanomachines were unlikely to be spotted by baffled stari ( the old ones , the people of former ages ) . They were also cheap to send and recover , and that was important : the biggest item on Pastplor 's budget was energy . In time the globules would yield the finest database ever assembled on the world 's weather , its past and probable future . <p> " The final Authorized Use , " the atonal voice went on , " is to investigate the origins of the Time of Troubles . This great catastrophe- the war of 2091 , the Two Year Winter , and the Nine Plagues - created our world ; we can hardly learn too much about it . You , young ladies and gentlemans , will find in these endeavors your lifeworks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger . Last year a surfer was sent - at the cost of a gigawatt of energy , chargeable to this agency 's budget - to the Imperial Chinese People 's Republic in 2041 . A defective accent in Archaic Mandarin gave him away and he was arrested as a spy . His control device was taken from him before he could use it to escape , and when we attempted to recover him we got instead an officer of the Imperial People 's Liberation Army . Interrogation of this officer revealed that your poor young colleague died while undergoing a torture called ' the points , ' which I will not describe as you might find it too distressing . <p> " Remember that past times may be dangerous , " the black box concluded solemnly , and dismissed them for lunch . <p> Maks followed his friends to an underground cafeteria filled with the clash and rattle of trays and people yelling at each other to be heard above the din . <p> " What fiendish torture , young ladies and gentlemans , was the captured Chinese officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimicking the blank , flat tones of the black box . <p> " The points ? " asked Maks . <p> " No . He was forced to eat this soyloaf . " Everybody groaned in sympathy with the victim . <p> " You 're getting beautiful , " said the woman with whom Vray Dak had finally settled down . To the golizi she was a registered prost , but that only proved the headquarters supermashini were behind the times . <p> Getting too old to live by whoring , she 'd gone to a school that billed itself as the Academy of Beauty and turned herself into a skilled cosmetician . Now she earned her living from the brothels in a new way , making up the inmates for their evening work . In one of the houses she 'd met Vray . <p> He was rather proud of the fact that he 'd lost six kilos lately . Most of the flab he 'd added as a free man was now gone ; his hairless body was sleek as a fish . <p> " Yet I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? I like you the way you are . " <p> " I have to get down to about seventy kilos before Great Genghis Day . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " If you do n't stop asking questions , I 'll kill you . " <p> An odd duck , she thought . He talked about losing weight and killing in exactly the same tone of voice . <p> She looked at him narrowly . She was seventy , well into middle age , and she had n't been a beauty even when young . She had never quite understood what he saw in her , a younger man with good connections in the mafya . <p> " Loki , my love , I wo n't ask even one more , " she promised . <p> That was the name he preferred to be called . He said it was connected to his religion . He smiled , and she nestled into the crook of his arm . <p> " Oh , incidentally , " he said . <p> Yes ? ' <p> " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some contact lenses . And I 'll need you to make me up for a job . " <p> Ah , she thought , so that 's what he sees in me . But she was a realist ; she not only did n't resent his making use of her , she was glad of it . It was another bond between them . <p> " Whatever you want , my dear , " she said , and soon - his body reacting as it usually did to submissive words and acts - she had her reward . <p> Maks 's first year as a surfer turned out to be frustrating , then infuriating . Instead of surfing , he found himself turning into a glorified technician and button-pusher . <p> People he knew went to the past , but not Maks . His own classmates returned to London , New York , Moscow . Then people from the next class started going . Even Lian : she had graduated number one at the academy and from her first day at Pastplor everyone treated her with respect . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Colonel Yost as the agency 's great hope for the future . <p> When Lian was picked to visit New York in 2025 , Maks decided to complain . He asked for an appointment with Yost and was refused . Too angry to be scared , he went to the top : asked for an appointment with General Yamashita himself . Somewhat to his surprise , he was granted five minutes and for the first time entered the Security Forces ' command suite , sixty meters down in the most secure part of the Palace of Justice . <p> The first thing he noticed was the ubiquity of Darksiders . Smelling atrociously , the huge beasts , with their four arms , thick-furred pelts , mandrill faces and red-amber eyes , seemed to stand at every corner of the long , zigzag marble corridor leading to Yamashita 's den . Every one of them clanked in cartridge belts and fingered five-kilo impact weapons that looked like toys in their massive fists . <p> Sometimes in Fastplor Maks almost forgot that he was part of the Security Forces ; down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A black box ordered him to stand at attention just outside the General 's office , where he remained immobile , his nose itching devilishly , for twenty-seven minutes by a large wall clock . Then , just as abruptly , the box ordered him into the sanctum . <p> The big office was clean as a Zen temple , hard as a tomb . In the center reposed a wide empty desk like a frozen lake , a huge mashing , and Yamashita himself , a bemedaled monolith in a tall black chair . <p> " What the fuck do you want ? " <p> That did n't sound promising . Maks had not been invited to stand at ease , so he stared at a far-off blank wall and spoke as much like a black box as he could . <p> " Sir , I 've been a timesurfer for two years and have yet to be sent into the past . If I 'm an asset , I deserve assignment like the others . If I 'm not , I want to know it so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You wasted my time with this ? " <p> " General , you can settle the rest of my life in two seconds . Nobody else can . " <p> Considering that the room was cool , Maks was astonished to find himself sweating in so many different places . One large cold bead traveled down the furrow of his spine ; he would have given anything to stop its ticklish progress . <p> Yamashita barked at his mashing , " Record of this T/S 1 you gave the appointment to . " Glancing at the record , he said , " Yost does n't trust you because you fucked up on a test . " <p> " Sir , I did n't know it was a test . " <p> " Those are the only tests that matter . Do you want to stay with the program ? " <p> More than I want to live , Maks almost said . But no , the general did n't deal in exaggerations . <p> " Very much , Sir . " <p> " You 'll be tested again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Recovering his equanimity in a toilet outside the command suite , Maks thought with narrowed eyes of Makluan , the red-haired tech who 'd tricked him . The man now worked at Pastplor , and Maks had to see him almost every day . Maks was n't a hater , but he made an exception for Makluan . <p> Yamashita was as good as his word . New orders were received , and a few days later , in the company of Timesurfer Mogul Peshawar , Maks went back to Pastplor 's offices as they had been just before the agency occupied them . <p> The outside doors were still sealed . The cells of the White Chamber stood empty , dark and abandoned . Some of the light switches worked , some did n't . With Mogul beside him , Maks walked the echoing corridors , observing and describing , his hand-held recorder disk growing slick with chilly sweat . <p> Dread invested everything . The thick cell doors , some covered on the inside with ratty carpet for added silence . The lingering smell of Darksiders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully under a light held by Mogul . Hundreds of dates , curses ( " Fuck all thuggi " ) , questions ( " Why am I here ? " ) , prison names and boasts ( " Red Pepper too tough , never break " ) , pleas ( " Tell my wife Dzhimi still loves her " / , despair ( " Death call me " ) . <p> " Why 'd they send us here ? " he whispered to Mogul . <p> " Still trying to toughen you up , I guess . " <p> " I 'm not a coward . " <p> " No , you 're just a sweet kid . Time travel 's not for sweet kids . " While Mogul paused to take down an inscription that interested him , a seething Maks walked into what had certainly been a torture chamber . it was larger than most of the cells , and deep in shadow . His handlight showed nothing but the usual battered metal table , the dangling wires , the blood drains . <p> Skin crawling , he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spun around to see an immense Darksider that seemed to have sprung out of the walls lurch toward him , swinging a huge spiked club over its head . He gasped , almost broke and ran out of the chamber , out of Pastplor , out of the whole goddamn business of dealing with the unspeakable past . <p> Then , inside his head , he heard his father 's voice say firmly Once but not twice . He stiffened , stared into the animal 's red/black eyes . Realized suddenly what some deep part of his brain had already noted : He could n't smell the Darksider . <p> Suddenly he began to laugh . As he did , the image broke up , dislimned , evaporated . Around the ceiling a prickle of tiny lights in laser projectors darkened . <p> Mogul dawdled into the chamber . " I guess we can go back now , " he said . <p> BY COMPARISON WITH that test , Maks 's first trip into what surfers called the " real past " was easy at first . <p> He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording data in the Library of Congress . The aim was to discover America 's role , if any , in bringing on the Time of Troubles . <p> For the first time Maks absorbed the sense of another age - the strange food , the metallic taste of polluted air , the babble of archaic words , the dizzying throngs on the streets . The star/ were a strange bunch , with their odd hairstyles and odder clothes and their abrupt , informal manners . They talked about the Century When Everything Went Wrong , about the party strife paralyzing the government , about the Chinese ambassador 's public remark that he no longer bought congressmen because renting them was cheaper . Cynicism was in style . <p> The picture he and Mogul assembled from documents confirmed popular opinion . The long-dominant American economy had stalled . The gigantic Chinese industrial machine ruthlessly outproduced and undersold all rivals . Nature had been merciless - California had been devastated by the worst earthquake in history , the nation 's other rich coastal regions flooded by a sea rising faster than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the coastline , and the stock market had followed . <p> As wealth declined , taxes soared and a small antitax rebellion in the West had been fanned by foolish policies into a major regional uprising , the first since the Civil War . <p> To Maks 's surprise , the current President , Derrick Minh Smith , was a break from the long run of Decadent Presidents who disgraced the midcentury . Tough and able , he tried to suppress disorder while winning himself the nickname of The Peacemaker for his tireless efforts to avoid war with China . America seemed to have had nothing to do with fanning the rivalries that led to the Troubles . <p> Instead the picture was of a great nation undergoing slow internal decay . The library building was still ornately beautiful but falling apart for lack of upkeep . Carpets were worn , tiles displaced . The quaint toilets overflowed . Bits of glass fell from mosaics and tinkled on the marble floor as Maks walked by . <p> Outside , the summer heat was stifling and brownouts and blackouts increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept dollars , demanding good solid rubles instead . Programs on the tivis crude and brainless mashini - touted " An Age of Gold : The Twentieth Century . " Or the nineteenth . Or the eighteenth . Any time but now . <p> Toward the end of Maks 's visit , the disorder began to hit home . Political parties had multiplied , fielding private armies of agitators and thugs who battled each other in the streets . Rioting over some incomprehensible issue broke out one evening and troops carrying big clumsy rifles and wearing primitive night-vision helmets trotted up to guard the library . <p> That evening the murmur of mobs sounded like summer thunder and fires glowed in the distance . Males and Mogul climbed to the roof of their rooming house to watch . Odd-looking aircraft buzzed like big wasps , dropping an irritant gas that drifted with the wind and forced the two surfers to go to their room and sit there , sweating , with closed windows . <p> Next morning Mogul was too sick to work . During the day he got sicker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulanor . By the following day his condition had become so bad that Males had to call for help ; they were both returned early and immediately put into an isolation unit until the virus , an ancient and lethal form of influenza , could be identified and destroyed . <p> Males got a promotion for saving Mogul 's life . He 'd done well in a simple assignment ; other and better ones loomed . His time of waiting was over . He called the girl he 'd taken to Antartica ; her name was Maia ; he hinted that he 'd had great adventures , asked her to join him at Lake Bai for Great Genghis Day , and she agreed . <p> Suddenly his world looked rich indeed . <p> Great Genghis Day had expanded to a three-day midsummer holiday , and traditionally people went wild the first evening , which was called pyatnit , or Drunk Night . The second night was for the fireworks display and patriotic oratory about humanity 's forward march . The third was for recovery , with a workday looming ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after pyatnit was celebrated with bloodshot eyes ; headaches and hot cups of strong green tea . In the Four Seasons teahouse , however , a bore in a wig seemed to have no hangover at all . He was questioning a sleepy-looking man - pale- faced and red-haired - who 'd spent the night in one of the cheaper brothels . <p> " So you 're in time travel , " said the bewigged one . " Tell me this : do you know what the basic factor of history is ? " <p> " Do n't ask me . As I told you , all I do is run the goddamn machine . " <p> " Well , let me tell you , then . The basic factor is context . " <p> " No shit . " <p> The tech had put in a strenuous night . He lived alone and when he visited a brothel tried to make up for lost time . Last night he 'd gotten drunk and ended up spending far beyond his means . <p> " Yes : Move an event from one temporal context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new leaf . If Hitler had tried his tricks under Kaiser Wilhelm , he would have been sent to an asylum ; if under the Federal Republic of Germany , to jail . " <p> " Hitler who ? " asked the tech , taking out a kif pipe and waving it at a waiter . He would have gotten up and moved away from the bore except that he felt so tired . <p> Thank the Great Tao today 's a holiday , he was thinking . One pipe and I 'll go home to sleep . <p> " Or consider the Time of Troubles . " <p> " Must It " asked the tech , stoking his pipe with a thin pinch of kif that the waiter had brought him . <p> He could n't believe , looking back , that he had spent every khan he owned . Not a silver half-khan , not a copper tenth was left to chink in his pockets . His bank account was overdrawn . What would he eat on until payday ? Who would he eat and For he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nuclear war would have ruined a few cities and that 's all . In 1970 , it would have caused an immense but endurable catastrophe . In 2091 , it devastated the Earth and almost annihilated humanity . But by then there were offworld colonies to resettle our lamentable planet . " <p> The tech , never a polite man , was growing irritable . <p> " Mister , I 've known sweeper robots had more original ideas than you . " <p> Vray gave no sign of being insulted . His quiet voice droned on - a white sound , not unpleasant . He signaled for more tea for both of them . <p> " My point is that there was a window - shall we say - a window of opportunity . A time when sophisticated weapons existed but the offworld colonies were n't yet self-sustaining . Let 's say from about 1980 to 2070 . If the war had occurred then - " <p> " We would n't be drinking green tea and three hundred planets would be empty of the human life that infests them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly to thank Vray for the fresh tea . Vray noted that his companion had already reduced his pinch of kif to ashes . <p> " Allow me to buy you a decent quantity of kif . " <p> " Do n't mind if you do . " <p> By the third pipe they 'd gotten quite chummy . The tech 's name was Makluan and his view of life was anything but cheerful . <p> " I work with the world 's most complicated and most useless goddamn machine , " he groused , " and I get paid peanuts for doing it . I keep thinking things will get better , my life will turn around . I wish I could go to sleep for a thousand years , wake up and see if things 've improved . If not , go back to sleep again . " <p> " A man of your intelligence deserves better . " <p> " You 're fucking right . By the way , " said Makluan , " what 's your business ? " <p> " Oh , " said Vray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twice-owned mashini , tales and so on . I wonder , could you use some extra money ? " " Absolutely , " said the tech , suddenly alert . <p> " It 's a great piece of luck for me , meeting you this way . I 'm thinking of adding certain sophisticated devices to my inventory , but I 'm just not capable of understanding their fine points . I 'd pay a thousand khans to have a man of your intelligence advise me . " <p> Makliian tried to conceal his delight , not very successfully . <p> " It sounds quite , ah , quite interesting , " he muttered . " When would you like me to look these gadgets over ? " <p> " If you 're free , " said Vray , rising , " there 's no time like the present . And please - allow me to pay your check . " <p> AFTER THE LONG , long years of preparation , things were speeding up . It 's now or never , Vray thought . Before Makluan 's absence is noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes that he so kindly gave me just before dying . Now . <p> Fierce lines of afternoon sunlight burned around the shutters of the small room where he sat , dreaming of what was to come . He returned to the present when the woman sitting across the duroplast table from him - dumpy , washed-out , utterly forgettable , but a genius at her trade /which , oddly enough , had once been his trade - asked : <p> " Well , what d' you want me to do with this ? " <p> " First , I want you to read the code . Can you do it ? " <p> She frowned at the square of hard ceramic lamina he 'd given her , at the stacked layers of dotcode and the hologram of a pale-faced , red-haired man imprinted not on the ID but in it . She turned and snapped it into a monitor and dropped a pirated memory cube into the queue . <p> " Standard polizi code , " she said . " Name , Makluan Artur ; Age , 31 ; Height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wormholes Technician ; Employer , Pastplor ; Clearance , 1A ; Police Record , None . Description ... Well , that 's the problem . You ca n't just insert your own picture and a new description to match yourself . " <p> " Right . The mashing at the guard station would pick it up . Description and picture must match those in the system 's memory . At the same time , a human guard will be looking from the ID to my face . He 'll be looking casually , stupidly , the way those people always do . But he 'll be looking . I want you to retain the hologram on the ID but morph it until it closely resembles this one . " <p> She took the new hologram , frowning . It showed Vray wearing , not the cheap wig he 'd received from the penal colony , but an expensive red wig precisely the color of Makluan 's hair . Vray 's dark/pale face had been made up to resemble the tech 's red/pale coloring , with a sprinkle of ginger freckles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar blue-gray of Makluan 's . <p> " Huh , " she muttered . " You 're rather good-looking , he 's ugly as a stump , and yet the bone structure is quite similar . And so is the height . Is that why you picked him ? " She made a few quick measurements . " Did n't shut your jaws for the picture , did you ? Bit your tongue . Lengthened your face a centimeter or so . Gave you that horsey look . " <p> She nodded . " I can do it . " <p> " Today ? " <p> " That will cost you double . I 've got a ton of work . " <p> " Perhaps I can come back tonight , bring the money and pick up the card . " <p> " Very well , " she said . " Come about nineteen . It 's none of my business , but I 'm rather curious about your interest in Pastplor . I hope you do n't mean to try and steal the wormholes . That 's a beheader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Hardly practical , since the wormholes weighs seven metric tons . I deal in small electronic devices of all sorts . The offices of this outfit are full of them and the security , once you 're past the guard post , is negligible . By the way : if you ever need a new monitor , let me know . " <p> She gave him a washed-out smile as he left . He almost regretted having to kill her . <p> " At nineteen then , " he said , and went away . <p> Arriving back at work the day after the holiday - he and Maia had become more than friends at Lake Bai - Maks found a knot of polizi at the guard station and signs of strain among the technicians . <p> " What 's the problem ? " he asked Mogul , now back at work , a bit stringier and leaner than before . <p> " You know that red-haired guy , the wormholes technician ? Well , the polizi found his body early this morning . He 'd been tortured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have liked to kill Makluan himself , but <p> " And there 's been a security breach , too . Do n't know exactly what . But the whole place is boiling like a teakettle . " <p> In the hall , Lian grabbed Maks and pulled him into a vacant office and shut the door . One of the surprising things about her was her talent for picking up gossip . <p> " Make ; they 've gotten back the medical examiner 's preliminary report on the time of death for that son of a bitch Makluan . You remember him , do n't your " <p> " Only too well , " said Maks . <p> " Well , somebody used his ID to enter Pastplor a good twelve hours after he 'd been killed . " <p> Maks gave a long , low whistle . <p> " That 's not the worst of it . The intruder might have been just a thief . But the wormholer 's been tampered with . " <p> They stared at each other . <p> " Another Crux ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is , someone totally unauthorized has gone into the past . Back before the Time of Troubles . Why , nobody seems to know . " <p> By lunchtime other tidbits had been fed into the gossip mill . <p> " The polizi are finding other bodies , " Lian reported to Maks and Mogul . They were eating together at a corner table in the noisy cafeteria . " They 've found physical evidence to connect Makluan 's death with the murders of two women . " <p> " It 's a conspiracy , " said Mogul . <p> " Either that or somebody who really gets around . " <p> It was late in the afternoon of a stressful day when Colonel Yost called a meeting of the timesurfers . Because of the crowd the white-tiled walls soon became steamy with moisture . <p> Maks had always vaguely liked and trusted Yost 's long pale face and his precise intellectual air . Stories that he presided at shosho sessions Maks dismissed as gossip . <p> Today Yost seemed undisturbed either by the heat or by catastrophic events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then delivered some new tidbits . <p> " I must tell you that this incident has the makings of a major scandal . " <p> He sighed , his most emotional reaction so far . <p> " Tentative identification of our intruder has been made from the DNA in traces of semen retained in the body of one of his victims . Though he sometimes went by the name of Loki , he is really a criminal named Vray Dak , who served time in a penal colony . " <p> " Are we sending somebody into the past after him ? " Lian wanted to know . <p> " That has not yet been decided . " <p> But as the members of the agency filed out , Yost called Mogul and Males aside . In a low voice he told them that , while Vray had erased his destination from the wormholer 's memory , a backup memory retained it . <p> " I believe this may have been Makluan 's last contribution to Pastplor , " he said . " To conceal the existence of the backup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary code . The tortures to which he was subjected indicated a certain inartistic crudeness on the part of the murderer . Or perhaps simply haste . " <p> Something about the quiet , pedantic way he said this gave Males a chill . Then Yost 's next words made him forget everything else . <p> " His goal is Washington , two years before you men visited it . Please prepare at once far a new transit . I have no one else who knows anything about the city . You must go first , prepare a hiding place , and guide the polizi when they arrive . My statement that no decision has been made , " he added apologetically , " was not entirely true . " <p> How splendid it all is , Loki was thinking . <p> He sat on a broad marble terrace gazing into the dense pollen-colored light of the setting sun . In the distance a battle was raging on one of the city 's broad avenues - a scuffle of black beetles , it looked like from this hill . Primitive noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had discarded his useless and inappropriate former names once and for all . No more Vray Dak , the counterfeiter of identities . No more Ya7326 the convict : Instead the name of an ancient fire god , a malicious being whose business was destruction . <p> To lounge upon a high place , looking down on a world , knowing that its future and its fate lay in your hands - if being a god did n't mean this , what did it mean ? <p> If he had ever doubted the fact of his deification in the tunnels of Calisto , he doubted it no longer . For this he had undergone torture and exile , to bum away the merely human , to make him the fated master or the master of fate - he had become . He curled his fingers around empty air , feeling he held such mosh as no human had ever known . <p> Gas grenades popped and a column of masked soldiers double-timed toward the disturbance . They carried knives on the ends of their firearms and the points glinted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields of the Gobi . <p> He stood up and craned to see better , then ducked involuntarily as a bullet whistled overhead . He frowned at himself : as if a bit of metal could injure him . <p> Commands were shouted nearby and he turned to see a file of soldiers appear around the corner of an antique domed building looming behind him . A sergeant shouted at him and gestured coarsely with one thumb . Loki thought of killing him - he was carrying an impact pistol under a loose shirt he 'd procured from the costume room at Pastplor . <p> No , he thought , retiring down a long flight of stained and worn marble steps , better do nothing to call premature attention to myself . There 'll be killing enough later on . <p> That night was noisy and humid . Loki padded down a tree-lined street , reflecting on his first day here . The language was more of a problem than he 'd expected . You could n't learn much about the way real people spoke from a book , even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ancient gobbling , mispronounced , full of allusions to things that had vanished centuries ago . <p> On the other hand , some things were unexpectedly easy about living in this world . The fact that he had an unintelligible accent did n't seem to bother anyone . The same was true of half the people in Washington . So far nobody had asked him for an ID . There seemed to be no checkpoints , no random arrests . The lack of social controls made him feel first giddy , then anxious . <p> Why , he thought , you can hardly call this a society at all - everybody doing whatever they please ! <p> He was still brooding about the deplorable lack of order when he spotted an elderly woman who had come out to buy food . At once he forced her into an alley , killed her with a blow to the nape of the neck and robbed her . For a little time he hovered over the corpse whispering to the woman ( as he 'd whispered to Makluan and his lover and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom . <p> Then he went to dinner . <p> He ate in a small food shop , paying five thousand dollars from his store of stolen cash , and left the shop picking his teeth . Spotting a sign in a dimly lit window , he rented a room nine or ten blocks from the Capitol building . When the landlord tried to find out something about him , he relapsed into Alspeke . <p> " Ya kam ' syuda vas destrukta , " he smiled , telling the truth for once . I came here to destroy you . You plural - all of you . <p> " Oh , a Russian , " said the landlord . Mr. Santana wore his gray undershirt and permanent stubble of beard like a uniform of his calling . " I guess your luggage 'll be along later ? " <p> " Yess , " said Loki , with what he hoped was a friendly smile . <p> " One thing I got to say for you people , you know how to run a country , " said the landlord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not like them fuckers down the street . " <p> Left alone , Loki counted his money , checked the impact pistol he 'd bought on Ulanor 's black market , and went to bed . Sleep proved difficult , for the heat was oppressive and a brownout had reduced the bed-sitter 's primitive aircooler to tentative gasps . He got up , sweating , opened a window , dragged his mattress onto a little halfmoon-shaped balcony and stretched out there . A bit cooler , though not much . <p> In the distance , a shot . Closer at hand , a scream . Just below the balcony , a laugh . Ah , my brothers and sisters , he thought . They 're all about , the hunters prowling the dark , rejoicing in the disorder that frightens everyone else . <p> Eventually he fell asleep and dreamed of slaughter until he was awakened by the sun . <p> On their second trip to Washington , Maks and Mogul found the city much as before . Sometimes it was hard to remember that they were two years deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , since everything seemed just about the same . <p> President Derrick Mink Smith was completing his second year in office and his record so far was the subject of noisy debate . A big , solid , slow-talking politician , he had the necessary ethnic mix - part white , part black , part latin , part southasian . ( Southasians were current favorites with Americans because of their heroic resistance to Chinese aggression . * <p> He came to power with a mandate for restoring order , but his use of force so far had been brutal and inept . In Idaho several National Guard units had gone over to the rebels ; people were talking about a downward spiral , but nobody knew how to stop it . <p> As for Vray Dak , he was invisible in a disorderly city of nineteen million . Completely untrained in police work , Maks and Mogul had not a clue as to how to proceed , except to get a place to live and prepare for the arrival of the professionals who would manage the search . They found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burned-Out District , in a **26;1926;TOOLONG red-brick rowhouse owned by a slatternly widow named Mrs. Crane . <p> Here they laid out their small valises with a change of 21st-century clothing , impact pistols , their own wormholer controls and two extras one to return Vray 's body to their own time , one for backup in case a control was damaged . Then they went shopping , using a counterfeit cashcard manufactured by the Security Forces ' digital imagers . They needed to be in electronic contact with this world , and so they bought first a tivi that received the local thousand channels . <p> " A thousand ! " said Mogul , shaking his head . " Great Tao , Ulanor gets along with three channels . In the offworlds , there are whole planets that have exactly one . I do n't see how the government can maintain control , do you ? Why , anything might go out over the air ! Do you suppose the polizi watch all thousand ? " <p> Maks shook his head . This world grew stranger , not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's no wonder everything 's in such a mess , " he had to agree . " Nobody 's in charge here . " <p> The day was hot , the walk long . The tainted air made them cough , and the crowds were mind-numbing . Street-corner orators bawled their messages and small crowds of red-faced , sweating people shouted yea or nay . <p> In another electronics store they bought a second kind of primitive mashina . This one had a brain , and was called a kompyutor . <p> " Everybody 's got one , " a baffled clerk told them . " Where you guys from ? No , you do n't need a license to own it . What do people do with it ? Well , they all send and receive whatever they please , including invitations to attend riots . It 's up to you what you use it for . " <p> They returned to their apartment weary and soaked their feet , sitting side by side on the edge of a pink plastic tub that sported the hair of unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to examine the purchases they 'd made during the day . <p> The tivi was a disappointment - just sex , sports , baffling comedies , ranting Old Believer priests . They set the kompyutor up on a battered plastic kitchen table and were just about to try a few commands when the room flickered . <p> A sudden hot wind rushed through the apartment , tossing their unpacked clothing against the walls . A figure condensed as if a billion pixels had rushed together from the far horizons to form a single image . The image moved , smiled- the woman was wearing the clothing of the 21 st century and carrying an impact pistol in her hand - and she was Zo Lian . <p> At once the kompyutor was abandoned . For an instant Maks wanted to ask Lian how she 'd found them so precisely , but then he forgot the question . Instead they embraced and laughed , and then they all went out for dinner . <p> The soy house had its own gasoline-run generator and a big fan that whipped the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks and sat down together on the grass in a small park while dusk darkened into breathless night . The heat was such that forty or fifty people were resting on the grass nearby . <p> They chatted softly in Alspeke , a language that only one other man in the city could have understood . <p> " Why 'd they decide to send you , Lian ? " <p> " I harassed Colonel Yost until he agreed . " She touched Maks 's arm . <p> " I thought you might need help . " <p> " Since you 're here to help us , " said Mogul with a slight ironic accent on help , " perhaps you 've got some idea of how to find one photon in a nova . In other words , one criminal in a 21 st-century metropolis . " <p> " Well , I do have a idea . Basically , this is why Yost allowed me to come . We 're assuming that Vray Dak wants to change history . So how 's he going to do it ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted Maks , " and I still do n't know . " <p> Lian had brought a meshok - beltpouch - of kif and three folding pipes with her . Since other people lying in the dark grass among the katydids were smoking various substances , the surfers lit up as well . Traffic rumbled on the nearby streets and polizi hovercraft buzzed and sputtered overhead , drawing white fingers of searchlights across the city . <p> " Here 's a suggestion , " said Lian . " The one thing he has that could make him a man of influence in this world is his knowledge of the future . Suppose he tries to set himself up as a prophet ? " <p> Maks smoked quietly , letting the drug relax and clarify his mind . It was Mogul who spoke up . <p> " That 's an idea , " he admitted . " And if you 're right , I think I know how to find him . " <p> " Ah , " said Maks . " The kompyutor . " <p> At this point a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Izvinitye , pozhal'sta . Vi govoritye po-russki ? " <p> " Not a word , " said Lian , and the three surfers got up , stretched themselves , and strolled away into the night . <p> " I could swear , " said the man querulously , " that those guys were talking some sort of Russian . I worked in Moscow for five years with our embassy and I recognized a word here , a word there . But it 's not like any Russian I ever heard . " <p> " Do n't ask me , " said a man who was lying next to him . " Not all so well I do n't know Inlish mine self . " <p> Then he rose and slouched casually away into the darkness , following the surfers . <p> The Russian speaker sighed and stretched out again , hoping for a breath of cool air but finding none . What a city , he thought . Nineteen million people and no two of them can really understand each other . No wonder things are in such a mess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Males quickly discovered . <p> In spite of all their training in archaic English , it was always misunderstanding their commands - even Lian 's , who spoke the language best . Though its cyberspace was limited to the Earth and Luna and ought to have been fairly simple to move around in , in fact it was more complicated than anything Males had ever seen . <p> As the clerk had told them , all sorts of totally unauthorized people used it for every imaginable purpose and finding things required a knowledge of mysterious icons that meant nothing to the time travelers . <p> Males was still confused and angry at the gadget when a thunderstorm swept in , relieving the heat but shutting off the electricity and blanking out the kompyutor . So they went to bed , waking only for the watch Mogul insisted they keep , sitting up one at a time with their backs against the apartment 's flimsy door . <p> Just after dawn , Maks , who 'd had the last watch , again tried his luck on the strange mashing . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuous of the primitive instrument yet baffled as to how to use it properly . Aside from offers from an array of sex services , the only thing of interest he seemed able to get was an infopage called The Moon Today , inserted by the International Space Agency . <p> The sound of the kompyutor 's nonhuman voice woke first Lian , who was sleeping on a divan , and then Mogul , who entered from the bedroom . " Things must be really crude up on Luna , " Maks reported . " It 's not <p> a self-sustaining colony yet . They 're just installing the first laser-fired pure-hydrogen reactor and it 's a new technology and everybody 's expecting it to blow up . They 've found the deep permafrost beds under the Sea of Tranquillity , but they have n't figured out a way to extract the water efficiently . Everyone 's living in domes half buried in the dust and drinking recycled urine . " <p> " I think I had some of that with dinner last night , " muttered Mogul , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color though not in taste . <p> Maks continued to try his luck , wasting some time futilely looking for Prophets . <p> " Try psychics , " suggested Lian . <p> " I do n't know that word . What does it mean ? " <p> " Just try it . " <p> Sure enough , the keyword yielded a directory of names and specialties . Some psychics apparently did nothing but find lost pets ; some , lost children ; some gave tips on the stock market ; some helped with errant lovers . Apparently President Smith was a believer , for some psychics averred that they were " Often Consulted by the White House . " <p> Many predicted the future , and here Maks concentrated his efforts . One advertisement followed another , every one rich in promises of better times . <p> " Poor bastards , " he muttered . " I suppose I could tell them , ' The future wo n't only be worse than you imagine ; the future will be worse than you can imagine.But who 'd want to believe that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly she said , " There ! " " Where ? " <p> " ' The Future So Real . Firm tip on whats happening politicly . ' Only our friend would be likely to write like that . " <p> Maks tapped the screen . A face startlingly like the dead tech stared out at them . The come-on promised , " Absolute tip on next year doing in high level political thing . Aks and you sall get all you wish to know bout Congress &; Pres outcome world event cetera . Cost merely $12.5K per suces . " A long string of symbols followed , concluding , " Futureman.psi . " <p> " I wonder how many customers he 's gotten with this , " smiled Lian . Mogul had joined them . " Can you ask him a question ? " <p> Maks enunciated Vray 's address in his best Archaic English and ordered , " Call . " <p> All three tensed : for the first time they were about to speak directly to their quarry . <p> " How can I assist you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . <p> " I would , " said Maks slowly and clearly , " like to know Futureman 's prediction for the outcome of the current fighting in Montana . Will the government be successful or will the rebels ? " <p> " Please leave your E-address . Futureman will return your call within thirty minutes . Cost to you will be only 12,500 dollars . " <p> They looked at each other . Mogul was saying , " Well , of course we do n't have an E-address , " and Lian was saying at the same time , " It 's some sort of answering service , do n't you see , " when they heard a scream from downstairs . <p> Then a small , dull sound on the staircase , more like a cough than anything else . <p> Lian recovered first , diving for her weapon as feet pounded up the wooden stairs . Males , slower to respond , was just beginning to grasp the danger when the flimsy door burst open and a tall man with red wig askew stepped into the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firing stud . <p> The round hit Mogul square in the chest and flung him backward over the kompyutor . Males was halfway to the floor by then and the second round clipped his flying hair and blew a small hole in the wall of the building . In the same instant Lian 's answering shot struck the intruder in the belly and tore him in half . <p> Suddenly and with amazingly little noise the room had become a bloody shambles . Blood sprayed the walls and ceiling ; dust drifted in the air , and a ray of sunlight entering through the crater blown by Vray 's round illuminated a slow-swirling universe of motes . Males raised a head whitened by plaster and stared uncomprehendingly at the ruin , the shattered bodies . <p> Lian got up quietly , gun in hand . Warily she approached Vray 's body , turned its lower half over . She knelt and spent a minute or two going through the pockets . Maks turned his attention to Mogul , but the sight was horrible and trying to help was pointless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twenty centimeters of his spine missing . <p> Shuddering , sick to his stomach but unable to vomit , Maks turned away . He stumbled to the window and stared out . The street looked absolutely normal . The hole was in a side wall and would go unnoticed unless the neighbors happened to look up . The impact weapons spoke so quietly that even the birds in the small , heat-dried plane trees outside continued to flutter and sing in celebration of dawn as if nothing had happened at all . <p> Lian showed Maks her bloody gleanings . Vray had almost 80,000 dollars in notes - " Not much , " remarked Lian , " he 'd have had to start stealing again pretty soon " - and several important items of information as well . <p> Makluan 's ID was there , with the picture Vray had used to set up his page . Several stained and folded pieces of paper : a receipt from We Speak 4 U Arbot Service ; another from the landlord of a rooming house on Capitol Hill not ten blocks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal keys for mechanical locks . <p> " Entry to his den , " she said . <p> Maks was still full of shock and sickness . He felt like a child ; he wanted to cry , but controlled himself . <p> " I guess I was n't much good in the crisis , " he muttered . He kept thinking that somehow he ought to have saved Mogul . Lian understood at once and spoke soothingly . <p> " You could n't have saved him , Maks . Anyway , he was the senior member of the party and the fact that we were caught off guard was more his fault than yours or mine . " <p> Maks nodded but felt no better . If not exactly a friend , Mogul had been his companion in adventure and they had trusted and depended on each other . <p> " I suppose we 'd better be preparing for transit , " Maks said . Then suddenly he turned and embraced Lian . <p> " Thank you . For saving me . I 'd be like Mogul except for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oddness of her body 's feel . She stood quietly , not responding to his embrace , just experiencing it . Then gently pushed him away . <p> " You'rewelcome , " she said . " But we 've got things to do . Before we go , we have to visit Vray 's apartment and clean out anything that might show he was from the future . " <p> " You 're right , you 're right , " Maks muttered , wondering how he could have overlooked something so obvious . Lian gave him another gentle shove , this time toward the bathroom . <p> " You ca n't go outside like that , " she said . " Wash off the blood . And get the plaster dust out of your hair . " <p> Now she 's treating me like a child , thought Maks resentfully as he scrubbed . Drying his head , he reflected on his career thus far . , All his life he 'd been a mediocrity , and Lian - cool and daring and inhumanly detached - had shown him only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoined her looking clean , sober . They walked down the stairs , avoiding their landlady 's shattered corpse , disturbing a few green flies . Out into the hot sunlight , where the air tasted like iron filings and the murmur of a mob could already be heard in the distance , preparing the day 's demonstration . <p> " I 'll be glad when we get home , " said Maks . Lian raised her eyebrows . .. Oh yet <p> " Yes . I 'm going to resign once this job 's done , " said Maks , and they walked the rest of the way to Vray 's dwelling without speaking . Finding a dour-looking , undershirted man seated on the front steps of <p> Vray 's building , they waited until he finished reading a crumpled piece of hardcopy - the four-page " morning paper " that could be bought for a 500dollar coin from containers at streetcorners - and shuffled away on some errand or other . <p> Then they used the two keys to enter first the house and-after much fruitless trying of locks - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with odd pieces of hardware left over from earlier centuries . Pipes for illuminating gas dangled from the ceiling and ancient painted-over copper wiring was still tacked to the baseboards . <p> They quickly searched Vray 's neatly made bed and closet , finding that he had carried his habits of deception and anonymity into the past with him . " The only things he had that clearly say Future ' we 've already got , " <p> said Lian when the search was over . " I thought he might have some extra rounds of ammo here , but apparently what we found was all he had . " Maks shook his head . " I still do n't really understand his plan . What <p> was he after , committing those murders in Ulanor , coming to this place ? What could he hope to accomplish ? " <p> Lian shrugged . <p> " I kicked that around with Colonel Yost before I left . It 's debatable , of course , but the date - 2050 - may be significant . The histories all say that tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until President Smith made concessions to buy peace . Vray might have hoped to influence Smith to set off the Time of Troubles early , which would have meant the end of humanity . Rather a pathetic hope , considering he could n't even speak the language decently . But then Vray may have been paranoid , with delusions of omnipotence . Whether he was born that way or driven around the bend by torture and isolation , who can say ? " <p> Males nodded slowly . <p> " It amazes me how you can figure things , " he said . " Well , come on , Liars . Let 's clear out . We 've got some messy work still to do . " <p> Liars shook her head , smiling . <p> " Males , Males , " she said , drawing her pistol . " It 's too bad . You 're such a nice guy , but so dumb . We 're not going back . I 'm going to carry out what Way started . Only I 'm going to do it right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Maks remove two slats from Vray 's bed and cords from the window blinds and wet them in the sink . <p> Then Maks had to lie down with his neck and wrists on one board while Lian laid the second over his Adam 's apple . She knelt on the second board , almost throttling him , and tied his wrists and head tightly between the boards . As a kang it was imperfect , but it served . <p> Lian tied his ankles as well . Finally , she gagged Maks with a tom pillowcase and left him lying on the floor while she returned to the other building to dispose of the corpses , sending them to the future . She was an efficient worker ; forty minutes later she was back , carrying a bag with her personal items . <p> Her last job before resting was to call up Vray 's web page and rewrite it in clear , elegant Archaic English . Then she removed Maks 's gag and sat down on the floor beside him to have a chat . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a confederate and that you and I were going after him . I added that no backup would be needed . I think that our success in getting rid of Vray will impress them enough to trust our judgment . Rif ? " <p> Lian held the pipe to Maks 's lips to help him smoke . Then , like old friends , they talked quietly together . <p> " How long have you been thinking about destroying us ? " asked Maks . His voice was still hoarse from Lian kneeling on his throat ; it hurt just to swallow his spit . <p> Lian thought for a long time . She had turned on a small lamp . Sitting on the floor she would n't sit on a chair , as if politeness forbade putting herself on a higher level than Maks ) she looked even less human than usual . <p> Like an extinct beast - what was its name ? Maks wondered . Oh yes , the cheetah . A kind of cat , skinny , long-limbed , with a great barrel chest and a killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , he remembered that the female of the species had been the most accomplished hunter . <p> " Do you know , " Lian finally asked , " how the Darksiders became servants of humanity ? " <p> " No . " <p> " My planet , Beta Charonis , has an unusual motion : one side always faces its sun , the other always away . A civilized race called the Siat gradually won dominance of the warm side . The Darksiders were primitives - intelligent but mute , with a crude material culture - and they were forced back gradually into the penumbra , the twilight between the two hemispheres . Often when they were under attack they had to retreat into the region of everlasting cold . They acquired the eyes of nocturnal beings , the fur of creatures acclimated to cold and the howling winds that always blow between the two sides of the planet . They lived in nomadic societies that you might call either packs or tribes . <p> " Then came the humans , and their mosh changed everything . The Siat resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans allied themselves to the Darksiders . Without fighting themselves , they supplied modern weapons to their barbarian friends , who proceeded to wipe out the Siat with unimaginable savagery . The Darksiders imprisoned their foes in pits and spent -I do n't know how long ; a long time - dragging them out a few at a time to flay and burn and eat . The humans took what they wanted from the planet , mainly ores , and in time they began to use the Darksiders as mercenaries . " <p> Maks said , " That 's a horrible story , but it does n't explain your actions . " <p> " It 's hard to convey , " said Lian , frowning . " There are n't any words for what I feel because there are n't any precise words for what I am . When the mining companies were looking for a way to adapt humans to Beta Charonis they borrowed a few surviving Siat slaves from the Darksiders and the mediki experimented on them . Of course our mediki were n't the best by any means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than they were supposed to change . Sometimes I think I 'm more Siat than human . Certainly I 've never felt human . And if I can bring this off , the whole episode of the human invasion will never have happened at all . " " How can you hope to destroy a whole species ? " <p> " It 's very , very difficult , " she sighed . " But I did n't come to Earth expecting it to be easy . In fact , until the timesurfer program was set up , I did n't have any clear plan at all . " <p> At this moment the kompyutor chimed . Lian listened to the query for Futureman - how would the coming congressional elections come out ? She answered that the party split would be : National Union , twelve percent ; Revolutionary All-American , seven point five percent ; Constitutional Conservative , seven percent ... and so on down to Democratic , three percent , and Republican , one point eight percent . <p> " You have a remarkable memory , " murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first trip to Washington two years from now , " said Lian . " It was truly informative . " <p> They smoked a while longer , until Maks got up the courage to ask another crucial question . <p> " What do you intend to do with me ? " <p> Lian let thin trickles of smoke exit her nostrils . <p> " I 'd like to let you live for whatever time remains , " she said . " Of course I ca n't . But killing you will be ... painful . I 've had such an awful life and for a while I thought - " <p> She coughed on the smoke , did n't finish . <p> Males twisted his head against the cords . Stared at her . Great Tao , he thought . So that 's it . <p> Then despair took over again . What if he was the window in the wall the experimenters on Beta Charonis had built around her ? She knew he 'd never love her , and so she 'd kill him in time . <p> The kompyutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The customer you just replied to wishes to know how you can make such precise predictions ? " <p> " Because , " said Lian . " I am not a psychic . I am a messenger from the future , come to prevent dreadful things from happening . President Derrick Minh Smith is the key figure , the pivot upon whom the ages turn . If he chooses right , the whole human species will live , and if he chooses wrong they will all perish . I 'm here to give him such help as I may . " <p> Lian smiled at Maks . <p> " That should attract the idiot , " she remarked . <p> The kompyutor chimed again . <p> " Yes , " said Lian . <p> " The previous customer has now paid 37,500 dollars , " said the service . " His new question is this : What will be the outcome of the present fighting in Idaho and Montana ? Will the federal forces win , or will the rebels ? " <p> " Neither , " answered Lian promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Chinese attack occurs . " <p> Apparently the cool-voiced arbot was n't prepared for phrases like <p> " Chinese attack . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " Repeat my words exactly as I have said them , " said Lian , and smiled at Maks . <p> " We have a fish , " she said . <p> Night came on with a sudden shower of rain , unexpected coolness . Lian fed herself and Maks : When Maks complained of pain in his shoulders , Lian massaged him gently but firmly . <p> " You ought to practice patience , " she admonished . " Pain is only pain , after all . With the proper attitude , one can endure anything . " <p> She sounded now like one of Maks 's childhood amahs . <p> For the night , Lian dragged and lifted Maks onto Vray 's bed , made him as comfortable as possible , tied his feet to the footboard , then put out the lamp and curled up like a cat on the floor . A little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the darkness , immobile in the kang , Maks could only think of Jesus , the god of the Old Believers , who had died on a cross . It 's a rotten way to go , he thought . I wonder if he had as little choice in the matter as I have . <p> He woke when the kompyutor chimed . Tall windows had turned gray and slow rain was falling . Lian spoke quietly to her caller , jotted something down on a scrap of paper . Then she cleaned herself up and put on fresh clothes . <p> " Someone important wants to interview me , " she told Maks . " I 'll try to be as quick as I can . Perhaps you 'd like a drink before I go ? " <p> Maks drank the water . He did n't bother to mention that he hurt , that he was stiff . Lian would simply tell him to practice patience . He also needed to urinate , but was embarrassed by the implications if he said so . <p> just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have had a worse executioner than you . " <p> " Oh , very definitely . " <p> Then Lian was gone . Quietly , checking the stairs first to be sure the landlord was not about , then locking the door behind her . Distantly the front door closed . <p> The rain fell like the slow drumming of bored fingers . Maks tried to keep his circulation going , clenching and unclenching his fists , wiggling his toes . His skin felt as if it had been sandpapered ; he itched intolerably . A cockroach climbed ticklishly up one leg , explored his face , and fed on fluid oozing from his nose until he sneezed and sent it scuttling away . <p> He needed to urinate , to defecate , tried to hold it , could n't . He had heard about prisoners who were forced to lie in their own excrement , but he had never thought he could be brought so low . <p> In a sudden fury , he twisted and wrenched at the cords until his neck and wrists bled . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out of the corners of his eyes and down his cheekbones . Thunder muttered a long way off . The rain stopped , then started again . <p> Footsteps were ascending the staircase . At first he thought Lian had returned , then realized that the steps were too heavy and too slow . A key rattled in the lock , and a weighty middle-aged man backed in . His arms were full of sheets , pillowcases and towels . It was change-the-linen day . <p> He turned , displaying the permanent bristle of gray beard , the permanent undershirt . A cigarette was sutured to his lower lip . When he caught sight of Maks , his jaw dropped but the cigarette clung to its place . <p> " Sheeeee , " he muttered . " Who 's this ? " <p> Maks made incoherent sounds and the landlord approached , wrinkling his nose . He pulled the gag off roughly and repeated his question . " I own this joint , " he added . " Name 's Santana . Now talk . " <p> " Your tenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick because the gag had dried his mouth . <p> " Good Christ , another Russian , " said Santana . " What is that guy , Mafia ? " <p> " Yes , mafya , " said Maks . <p> " Well , I 'll be goddamned . They know you at the embassy ? " <p> " Yes . Could you please untie mel " <p> The landlord frowned , debated the question in his mind . What if this guy was Moscow Mafia , tool On the other hand , he looked different from the tenant ; a different kind , more like a college kid . Slowly and reluctantly , he began to untie Maks . <p> " The Mafia must be like the Boy Scouts . " Why ? " <p> " Teach ' em to tie good knots . What 'd he want from you ? " <p> " Money and cashcards , " said Maks promptly . " He 's out right now , trying to use my cards . " <p> " We 'll call the cops as soon as I get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every muscle seemed to have frozen and rusted in place . Maks 's arms were dead white , his feet and ankles swollen . At first he could n't stand . Santana helped him , but with obvious reluctance . <p> " I can see you 've had a rough time , young fella , but frankly , you stink pretty bad . " <p> " Sorry . " <p> " Do n't apologize . Go wash . " <p> Maks did , while the landlord shook his head over the stained and fragrant bedding he 'd left behind . He took the sheets with obvious distaste and threw them into the hall . <p> Somewhat restored to decency , Maks rejoined him , wearing a set of Vray 's clothing with only moderate discomfort at armpits and crotch . " You call the polizi , " he told Santana ( the Alspeke word just slipped out ) . " I 'm going straight to the embassy to report this . My name is Ivanov Nikolas - pardon me , Nikolas Ivanov- and I 'll be there when they want me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Go stay in your apartment until the polizi come . Have you a weapon ? " <p> " You bet I do . The most illegal one I could find . " <p> " Shoot him if he tries to come in . Oh , and he has a confederate who 's even worse than he is - a young woman with weird-looking eyes . Stay completely out of her way . Tell the poliz - police that she 's armed with a new type of exploding ammo the Moscow Mafia 's been trying out . Tell them she 's extremely dangerous . " <p> Suddenly the forgotten cigarette burned the landlord 's lip and he cursed and flung it away . <p> " Christ , that thing cost me twelve bucks on the black market , " he muttered and lurched away into the shadowy hall . <p> Maks waited at the head of the stairs until he heard the door of Santana 's first-floor apartment close and four separate locks snap into place . Then he called the answering service on Vray 's kompyutor . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he said . " Would you please repeat it ? " <p> " Room 3657B , Executive Office Building . " <p> His last chore was to unplug the kompyutor and wrap it in an extra shirt . A minute later he was on the street , hungry and tense and happier than ever in his life just to be free , to be moving , to be capable of action again . The blood pumped deliciously through his whole body , erasing the last traces of stiffness . <p> Lian , Lian , he thought . You should have killed me when you had the chance . If you do n't know that yet , you will . <p> HE SMILED GRIMLY . Adrift in a disorderly city centuries before his birth with no money , no weapon , and no way to communicate with his own time or return to it , he was recalling Mogul 's remark that time travel was not for sweet kids . <p> Yet he had a plan . Maks was searching for the kind of shop where small loans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of him he could n't remember the Archaic English ; all he could think of was , for some reason , the game of chess . <p> He plunged into the streams of people flowing past the Capitol , with its peeling iron dome and mellow stone walls and small groups of soldiers idling near the autogun emplacements on the weedy lawn . <p> He 'd walked nearly three clicks when the word " pawn " suddenly registered in his mind . It was painted on a small windowless building equipped with a steel door and two hired thuggi lounging on a bench outside . Each man had a pistol stuck in his belt . They looked at Maks with the eyes of bored dogs as he entered . A few minutes later he emerged , richer by a thousand dollars - enough to buy breakfast , which he did at a greasy food kiosk down the street . <p> With food in his belly and vengeance on his mind , he found the rest of his walk to the White House easy . All that running and wrestling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House was easier to look at than to approach . The streets that ran by the Treasury were blocked off and patrolled by uniformed thuggi and by others in civilian clothes , each with a little button of a jabber mike stuck in his ear . They were , Maks decided , probably more dangerous than the uniformed types and he gave them a wide berth . <p> He had to circle wide , up 14th Street to Franklin Park , where more soldiers were encamped under spreading green trees , then along Eye Street to 17th and south again , giving Lafayette Square a wide berth . Must have been a riot there , he thought , eyeing the throng of soldiers and polizi and the meat wagons from the Medical Examiner 's office and the mediki removing bodies . <p> It was one P.M. - that is to say , thirteen - or a little past when he reached the old multi-columned Executive Office Building . On the rooftop , batteries of television cameras and laser-activated automatic weapons turned slowly from side to side ; within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . Further down 17th Street smoke was rising from the hulk of the Corcoran Museum , recently torched . <p> Intent as he was on finding Lian , he loitered for long minutes in this dangerous region , fascinated by the sight of his own world , the world of the Darksiders and the Security Forces , already - more than forty years before the war of 2091 - beginning to emerge from the decay of what textbooks called the Democratic Century . <p> Getting into the building seemed hopeless . Only one entry was open and people going through it were being checked and scanned . Lian had passed through that door at the invitation of someone within . But nobody had invited Maks , and if he lingered too long the kompyutors would spot him as a suspicious person . <p> For an instant he considered getting himself picked up for questioning ; at least it was a way in . But a shudder went through him just to think of it ; he knew now what being a prisoner meant . <p> Instead , he drifted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal ID collars , back to Pennsylvania Avenue and up it toward the northwest . He could not get at Lian inside the building , but he could wait for her to come out . Assuming , that is , he could tolerate waiting at all . <p> For Lian , the morning went first well , then badly . <p> The presidential aide who 'd vouched for her at the guardpost was lowly , a young man worthy of nothing more than a tiny office in a deep basement . The aide had dandruff and pinkish eyes and even a trace of acne , as if he 'd finished with adolescence only last month . A youngster whose life was a long series of putdowns from his superiors , he glared at her with defensive arrogance . <p> " So you 're from the future ? " Lian smiled . " just so . " <p> " I 'll try to explain in simple terms why I 'm wasting time with you . We 've got these arbors , little bundles of artificial intelligence with complicated algorithms that can carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrap subversives by drawing them into conversations where they give themselves away .... " <p> " I 'm familiar with the technique in possibly more sophisticated form , " said Lian patiently . <p> The aide frowned . " Well , false prophecies are politically useful in some instances but dangerous in others . So we have arbots check the psychics and draw them out . The odd thing about you is that your data on the next election 's quite close to some highly classified computer estimates done for the President . We 'd like to know where you got your information . " <p> " From a history , " said Lian , " that will not be written for three hundred years . If your estimates are in basic agreement with my data , I 'd say they 're quite accurate . May I make a suggestion ? " <p> The aide raised sandy eyebrows . <p> " Certain objects were taken from me when I passed through the checkpoint . If you ask to have them brought here , you may find what I 'm saying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched a button and spoke to a small , shiny intercom . Then he took some papers out of his desk and ostentatiously worked on them until the door opened and a uniformed guard placed in front of him a ceramic disk and two oblong devices with metal studs and Cyrillic lettering . <p> Lian picked up the disk and warmed it in her hands . " Say , " she told it . <p> " What time you get your break ? " <p> " Ten to . " <p> " Long time to go . " <p> " Tell me ' bout it . " <p> " Fuckin ' Redskins lost that preseason game . " <p> " Deadskins , I call ' em . " <p> The sparkling conversation at the guard post continued to unroll . The aide took the disk and examined it for controls , finding none . <p> " So you just talk to it , " he said with mild interest . " Neat . " <p> " Do you have anything similar ? " immediately the aide 's face became blank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps , " said Lian , losing patience , " you 'd be kind enough to direct me to someone less stupid than yourself ? " <p> The aide spoke again to the intercom . " Send a guard . I got somebody who 's leaving . " <p> " Do you have something like this ? " asked Lian . Playing her trump card , she handed over one of the controls . <p> " I 'm not touching one goddamn thing , " said the aide , rising . " You , lady , are a nut , and this thing I bet is a bomb . " <p> The door opened . A fat guard stood in the doorway , the one , Lian remembered , whose break was scheduled for ten-to . Without hesitation Lian handed her other control to the guard , who took it with a baffled look . <p> " Watch out ! " yelled the aide . <p> Lian touched the return stud and jumped back , shoving the aide against the wall . The guard 's plump body flickered , they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all . The doorway was empty . <p> Lian pushed the aide into his chair , closed the door , and sat down across from him again . <p> " Do you know where he 's gone ? " she asked , taking back the remaining control . <p> " To the future ? " asked the aide , weakly . <p> They sat looking at each other for the greater part of a minute . Finally Lian 's patience ran out again . <p> " Had n't you better notify your superiors ? " she asked . <p> " Oh , " said the aide . " Yeah . I guess so . " <p> In the ammoniac fumes of a men 's toilet , Maks bent over the recumbent body of a federal worker he had followed in and rapped lightly on the base of the skull . <p> He examined the ID collar closely , then stood up with a curse . There was no way to remove it except to saw it through or cut off the man 's head . He was tolerably certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't willing to decapitate anybody but Lian . <p> With a muttered apology , he took the man 's money - 120,000 dollars , he carried a fair sum - and his cashcard and slipped out of the toilet and the restaurant it belonged to , unobserved . <p> So now I 'm a thief , he was thinking . I wonder if they have penal colonies in 2050 . My guess is they do . <p> HOW TRUE the saying is , Lian reflected , that government is a system devised by geniuses to be run by idiots . It was as true in the 21 st century as in her own ; no doubt it had been true in the Venetian Republic , in the Tang Empire , in thrice-ancient Ur of the Chaldees . <p> The dandruffy aide 's superior was indeed that : superior . Paranoid , perhaps , but not to be accused of stupidity . He examined the ceramic disk and simply nodded . Nobody needed to tell him that it was the end product of a technological evolution that had hardly begun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be anything showing inside , " he muttered , adding with a faint smile , " I 'd like to have seen the business with the guard . " <p> He was a small man , balding , his flesh burnt away by a lifetime of trusting nobody . His name was Gray . <p> " Unfortunately , " Lian told him , " I 've only got one control device left . If you need to see it work , call in another guard . " <p> " You would n't mind being marooned in this goddamn century ? " asked Gray , continuing to smile bleakly . <p> " I can help you to make it better . Better than you might believe . Because , unlike anyone else now living , I know what happened . " <p> Gray put up a tent of thin bony fingers that were stained with some drug , probably nicotine . <p> " Tell me what ' happened , ' as you put it . " <p> " China will soon take advantage of America 's distress to attack you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do nothing . " <p> " Of course , " said Gray , who looked as if he could believe anything about anybody , especially allies . " You wo n't have heard yet , but China 's sending a peace delegation to discuss our outstanding differences . Quite a suspicious act in itself . What better time to start a war than while you 're talking peace ? Please go on . " <p> " A brief period of peace will be bought by the sacrifice of roughly ninety-two million American lives . But it 's only a breather . In circumstances that remain unclear , general war breaks out in 2052 with a thermo/bio exchange so massive as to create a two-year winter while launching lethal epidemics of genetically enhanced influenza viruses that decimate the survivors . Twelve billion people will die . " <p> Gray nodded . " About in line with projections . Every once in a while one of our engineered viruses gets loose and there 's hell to pay . " <p> " I have been sent to urge you as strongly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible catastrophe , which is known to our small community of survivors as the Time of Troubles . I refer to preventive war . " <p> Gray said slowly , " That possibility has been ... discussed . May I see that gadget ? " <p> Lian handed over the control . Gray sat back and looked at it , then , with-a wry smile , said to his intercom , " Call the guard station and tell them to send in Harry . " <p> To Lian he added , " He 's the one I can spare best . I hope the people in your time do n't mind being sent another idiot . " <p> The door opened and a hulking man entered . Harry looked like a Darksider without fur . Lian waited for the new experiment , her mind dwelling with amusement on the astonishment at Pastplor as still another bewildered stranger came through the wormholer . <p> " Arrest her , " said Gray , and Harry grabbed for Lian . <p> She reacted without thinking , jabbed the big man 's adam 's apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall with a gargling sound in his throat . Then Lian turned on Gray , only to find herself facing a crude pistol the man had pulled from some recess . <p> There was a sound of thunder . <p> " Whatever the truth may be , " Gray told the President , " I could hardly have allowed this person into your presence until she was rendered helpless and thoroughly scanned . We 've had too many cases of suiciders swallowing plastic microbombs , passing through the screens and blowing up everything in sight . " <p> Smith , staring at the control , merely nodded . <p> Of course they were n't in the Oval Office : that light-flooded room , for all its triple-paned bulletproof glass , was occupied only by a robot resembling the President , which moved about , conferring with other robots , appearing to drink coffee . It was there to draw fire . Recently a maniac had tried to crash a small plane into the office , only to be stopped in midair by a missile . <p> Thirty-six meters below , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices and guard posts , communication centers and dispensaries , dining halls and dormitories . This comfortable room was his favorite , its walls decorated with trompe l'oeil images of rare books . The furniture was deep-cushioned Victorian ; the pictures on the walls , historic portraits . <p> A rosewood armoire and the walls of creamy old plaster hid the electronic spiderweb that connected the President to the outside world . Overhead , faux candles flickered in a chandelier with one hundred prisms . An imitation fire burned in an imitation fireplace . <p> " Still , it 's too bad she 's dead , " said Smith in his deep , heavy voice . " I 'd like to know just what her game was . " <p> " Well , the ME 's working on the body now , " said Gray . " DNA 's still being analyzed , but parts of the genome have been replaced with sequences that are either nonhuman or else artificial . Her body 's undergone some kind of modification , possibly for life on another world . " <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Gray looked at his leader gratefully . He liked working for somebody who was almost as smart as he was . <p> " Exactly , Chief . If there 's to be a general catastrophe , if nothing 's left three hundred years from now but what our visitor called a small community of survivors , how did she happen to get modified for life on another planet ? For that matter , how did such a community manage to produce the sophisticated technology that brought her here ? Something 's wrong . " <p> " And , " said the President , shaking his head in wonder , " she came here to persuade me to wage a preventive war . " <p> " Ironic , is n't it i " <p> The two enjoyed a quiet smile together , members of an exclusive club of less than a dozen who knew the great secret . <p> " So , " Gray murmured , " our woman of the future died never knowing that her mission was needless , perfectly needless . Well , that 's luck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a meat wagon draw up to the executive office building , turn in through steel gates and vanish down a ramp . He had seen it reappear with a screaming motorcycle escort . The thought that Lian might have overplayed her hand occurred to him , but he had no way to be sure . <p> By three o'clock-that is , fifteen-he was inclined to think that the body removed by the wagon had in fact been Lian . Either that , or she 'd penetrated to the very center of power and was at this moment trying to persuade Smith to launch a war . In either case , Males was clearly wasting his time . <p> " Either she 's succeeded or she 's dead , " he thought . <p> Time for plan two , except that he had no plan two . In fact , he could imagine only one line of action , though it seemed to promise little . Vray 's house was clearly off limits to him , since the landlord would long since have called the polizi . But Mrs. Crane 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to the front door . He could at least search the place . <p> There had been four controls for the wormholer remaining after Lian dispatched the pile of bodies , and four pistols . He could n't imagine Lian carrying such a load of hardware into the executive office building , where everything might be confiscated . And where could she have left what she did not take but in that house ? <p> Maks caught a decrepit subway back to the Hill . The tunnels were defaced with slogans urging war , peace , offering sex , recording the names and initials of unknowns . There was no aircooling and the trains moved at about three clicks an hour . The crowds were stolid , silent , each person sweating and giving off organic fumes . At a station called Capitol South Maks exited , climbing escalators that were immobile and rusted into place . Hastening past the Library where he 'd do his research two years from now , he reached the back of the Supreme Court , or what was left of it after a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dull redbrick and rusty ironwork , and for a few minutes loitered outside . Looking up , he could see the hole in the side wall where Vray 's shot had gone through . Yet no polizi showed themselves and the block was deserted except for plastic cylinders of uncollected garbage . Perhaps nobody had noticed the violence of yesterday , or the missing woman . <p> Taking a deep breath , Maks climbed the iron steps to the front door , inserted his key , and opened it quietly . <p> The house was silent . He poked around downstairs , in the part of the house Mrs. Crane had kept for herself . Battered furniture , a convex mirror with a gilt eagle perching on it , paper doilies on the backs of the chairs . The kitchen was clean , bare and shoddy . Just outside the back door flies buzzed around a garbage can that had not been put out . <p> He closed the door , returned to the hallway and climbed the stairs . On the step where Mrs. Crane had died was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was surprised that Lian had found time to clean so thoroughly . On the second-floor landing , the door to the apartment he 'd shared with Mogul was closed . He turned the knob . Locked . He sniffed an unpleasant smell and concluded that Lian had failed to get rid of the bodies , after all . <p> He pushed his key into the lock and the door swung open . As it did a huge two-thumbed hairy hand reached out and seized him by the shoulder and dragged him inside . <p> The Darksider transferred his grip to the back of Maks 's neck . Its three other hands gave him a rough search . Meanwhile , from the bedroom emerged two thuggi in blue-gray uniforms and the crossbone insignia of Subsek , the antisubversion unit that ran a mysterious program called Special Investigations . Behind them came Colonel Yost , his long gray face bleak and frigid . <p> " So , " said Yost . " Hastings . Perhaps you can explain why - as Lian reported - you chose to betray your comrades , murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vray Dak . " <p> The story that Maks told did not go down very well . <p> " Zo Lian is in every way a rising star of our organization , " frowned Yost . " We granted her a secret commission in the Security Forces . She passed every test of loyalty we could devise . " <p> " Just as Vray passed every psychological test the penal colony could devise , " Maks pointed out wearily . <p> The Darksider was standing just behind him , enveloping him with its indescribable aroma . He was thinking of the image that had attacked him in the White Chamber . Well , this one was real enough . <p> " It 's true , " Yost conceded , " that no test has yet been devised that can penetrate the most secret places of the mind . But tell me , do you have a single shred of evidence to back up your version of what happened here ? " <p> Maks 's head fell slowly forward as despair gripped him . Was there anything ? Then he slowly pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists . The red lines of the cords that had bound him were still visible . Along each red furrow ran , like a small rosary , dark beads of dried blood . <p> He held out his wrists . Then he raised his hands - one of the thuggi reached for a gun - and opened his collar . Yost leaned forward , staring intently at the bruises . <p> " I see , " he said . " Yes , this is evidence - of a sort . " " Do you think I did this to myself ? " <p> " No . But I do n't know how it happened . Perhaps when Lian discovered your treason she tied you up . " <p> But there was now uncertainty in his eyes . As he meditated , a point about Maks 's story suddenly registered with him . <p> " You say that you saw Zo Lian enter the Executive Office Building , " he muttered . " One of our wormholes controls returned to us with a very astonished fat man who was unable to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he claimed to be a guard at that building . That 's why I came here myself - to see what the devil was happening . " <p> Suddenly he made his decision . " Ca n't you see that Timesurfer Hastings has no weapon ? " he snapped to a thug . " Arm him at once . " He gestured at the Darksider , which freed Maks . An instant later , an <p> impact pistol was in Maks 's grip , and he hefted it , feeling a profound urge to kill somebody . Almost anybody , though Zo Lian headed the list . Sweet kid , eh ? <p> " Now we must find the traitor , " said Yost , " and try to undo whatever trouble she 's causing . " <p> " How can we reach her ? " asked Maks , envisioning an assault by Darksiders on the White House , an event sure to attract unwelcome attention . <p> Yost smiled less bleakly than before . " Via the Worldcity , " he said . " Via your time and mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger than a grain of sand , but packed with nanomachines . We got the idea from the weather stations . We 'll follow the signal to the place where Lian is , after a detour of eighteen thousand kilometers and three hundred years . <p> " Surely our trip will give a new meaning to the old phrase about the shortest distance between two points . " <p> In the presidential bunker , Smith and Gray sat in overstuffed chairs smoking long cigars . <p> The doors to the armoire stood open ; the TV glowed . In three dimensions and a variety and depth of hue as rich as the portraits on the walls , a semicircle of bemedaled officers sat around a table . <p> Smith liked the new TYs , with their built-in receiver-senders and the near-perfect illusion of depth that enabled him to feel the presence of his subordinates without actually having them in the room with him . He distrusted his generals , just as other politicians as varied as Lincoln and Stalin had distrusted theirs . <p> " I take it , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imperial Chinese People 's Republic , " said Gray quietly . " We consider it excessively risky . Our space defense system remains <p> untested in actual combat , " said the chairman , Admiral Simms . " How is it to be tested in combat if we never go to war ? " <p> Gray enjoyed this kind of fencing . Besides , as National Defense Adviser , it was his role . By posing as the advocate of a war policy , he enabled Smith to give the appearance of sitting in impartial judgment on a matter he had already decided . <p> " Simulated attacks - " <p> " Have given excellent results , according to your memorandum of 23 January 2049 , " said Gray . " Shall I read it to you , Admiral ? " <p> The admiral looked uncomfortable . Of course the JCS always claimed to be ready for war : that was their business . To be in the position now of claiming that , after all , they actually were n't created a problem in logic that they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tall and slender as only a descendant of the Watusi could be , she owned a brace of doctorates in addition to her stars . She might have been chairman of the JCS , except that it had been the Navy 's turn . <p> " I would remind you , Mr. Gray , that as a result of treaty commitments American forces overseas are largely under the command of Russian generals , and that Russia has not given prior assent to our unilateral attack on China . " <p> Smith bestirred himself at that . <p> " Balancing diplomatic and military considerations is the job of the President alone , " he growled . <p> " Absolutely , " said Gray . " Besides , once our common enemy has been pulverized it 's the judgment of the Foreign Policy Adviser that the Russians will follow our lead . " <p> " Surely that 's intolerably risky - " <p> " May I say , " put in Gray smoothly , " that until today I never knew that military officers were so averse to risk ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These people , he reflected , spend their lives convincing themselves and others that they 're daring . For them to urge caution goes against their own self-image . <p> General Pozniak of the Air Force spoke up . <p> " In my opinion , preventive war is by far the best policy in the long run , " he declared . " China will only get stronger . We control our own strategic forces - or to be precise , the Air Force commands them . I 'm convinced that a decisive attack on China will not only win support from the Russians but spark a general uprising against Chinese occupation forces in Japan , Korea and Vietnam as well . I hope that the President will opt for war . " <p> " When do you recommend we attack , if the President decides upon that option ? " <p> " The first launch window will occur this afternoon between 1340 and 1920 hours , when our killer satellites will be in optimum position vis  --  vis the enemy 's orbital launch platforms . Here 's a schedule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something hummed in the comm system as a decrypt fax sent a long piece of hardcopy whispering into Gray 's hand . <p> Smith stirred again . <p> " Pending my decision I wish Condition Yellow to be instituted throughout the United States on the grounds that a new offensive is getting underway against the western rebels . Thank you for giving me your views , and have a good evening . " <p> Gray closed the doors of the armoire on the now silent and dark TV screen , then resumed his seat . For a few minutes he and Smith smoked in silence . The decrypt lay on a small 18th-century table , neglected . They were n't interested in any launch window but today 's . <p> " At last we 're at the point of action , " the big man remarked . " Congress can debate the war after it 's won . I do n't like the attitude of the Army and Navy chiefs . Simms thinks of nothing but his pension and I never should 've appointed that bitch Shabazz . Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in mind . " <p> Gray nodded . " I 've covered all the bases I can think of . Of course , things could go wrong . We might lose a few cities ourselves . " <p> " No pain , no gain , " said the President philosophically . " We 're going to revise this old world , Gray . Stop the downward slide . Save the good , and as for the bad - " <p> He blew a smoke ring . Gray nodded . There was no need for the President to complete the sentence . <p> Yamashita stared at Yost while Maks waited outside . <p> What ! The prison release he 'd ordered had set this Vray Dak loose= <p> The surfer program for which he was responsible had allowed some semialien to go through the wormholer to destroy the world ? <p> He thought of Kathmann 's end and knew that Yost would use the needles on him without hesitation if the Controller gave the order . " And where is the missing control - the one that 's beeping out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten very faint , " said Yost . " It 's underground , we think , in or near the White House in the lost city of Washington in the year 2050 . " <p> He added , " Maybe it 's been gut away in a vault or safe . If so , an arriving surfer might have his atoms jammed into a mass of solid steel . That 's why I 'll send young Hastings first . " <p> Yamashita hardly heard him . He was turning his head slowly , eyes panning the big , gleaming office toward which he 'd been striving for most of his life . Was anything in the world as fluid as mosh , so apt to slip out of your hands ? <p> He stood up , strapped on a pistol . Better to die in some goddamn primitive city than sit around here waiting for the laser to take off his head . He would trust nobody to handle this except himself . <p> " Yost , " he said , " take over while I 'm gone . " Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I want a volunteer to lead the way , " he said . " You 're my volunteer . " The two of them hastened to the nearest lift , up to Pastplor , down a long corridor to the transit room . Along the way they were joined by the rest of the task force , two thuggi and one Darksider . <p> Yamashita viewed the wonnholer with deep distrust that verged on loathing . He was remembering how Steffens Aleksandr , the Worldsaver , had entered the capsule of a bigger , cruder version of the device and returned as a shattered corpse . <p> Then he shook himself and gave Maks final instructions . " Press the signal stud on your control when you arrive . As soon as we get the message I 'll be right behind you . " <p> Maks jumped on the slide , pressing an opaque black cloth over his eyes to shield them from the flash . The instant he felt something hard beneath his feet he pulled the hand away and the cloth fell to the floor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant and quiet room filled with furniture of a type he 'd never seen before . He signaled as Yamashita had ordered , then began to explore . Almost at once he spotted the missing control and Lian 's recorder disk on a small table and put both into his beltpouch . <p> A fire seemed to he burning , but when Maks approached it he saw that the back of the fireplace was a three-dimensional screen broadcasting a fire . The books that lined the walls turned out to be fakes , too . Yamashita materialized behind him , tore off his goggles , and looked around with astonishment . <p> " Where are we ? " he demanded . <p> " In a house of illusions , " said Maks . <p> While the thuggi materialized , followed by the Darksider , Maks opened the armoire . A row of studs with icons lined the big screen inside ; recognizing some of them , he touched On . Elegantly convincing , the image of President Derrick Minh Smith sprang into view , speaking to the nation in a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this day will live in infamy . Without warning at 12:53 this afternoon , Washington time , our nation 's space defense system began to intercept incoming missiles . Computer calculations left no doubt of their origin : we were under attack by the Imperial People 's Republic of China , even as the diplomats of that aggressive nation were arriving to negotiate with us ! <p> " Was ever any nation so betrayed as ours ? But I assure you that this dastardly act has not gone unpunished . Within seconds a counterstrike by our missiles destroyed the enemy 's orbital launch platforms ! At the same time , our Space Defense System intercepted the approaching enemy missiles and - " <p> The picture flickered , the sound went out . Maks darted a glance at Yamashita , who stood erect , staring at nothing . The air in the room was still disturbed by the materializations , and papers overflowing Smith 's wide desk whispered to the floor . <p> Then a deep shudder passed through the bunker . Portraits rattled against the walls and a fine snowfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Persian carpet . <p> " Oh Great Tao , " whispered Maks . " Lian succeeded . " <p> His knees buckled and he almost fell , not from the impact of whatever weapon had exploded outside but from the dreadful realization that his world and every human world , past , present and future , was ending . The war was coming forty years too soon ; the Earth would be ruined , the Luna colony would perish when its lifeline was cut . Maia 's face flashed across his mind , and he clung to her image , the last his brain would hold . <p> " Bullshit , " snapped Yamashita , shattering his tragic mood . " She did n't have time - Wait . I see ! Good for Zo Lian ! We 'll have to put her statue next to the Worldsaver 's ! " <p> Suddenly he was pounding Maks 's shoulder with a karate-hardened fist . Maks retreated a step , wondering if the General had gone insane . " Asshole ! " he shouted . " Do n't you see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with Lian . But by bringing us here she gave us a chance ! We have to get back to Ulanor , quick , quick ! " <p> He pressed the return stud on his control and Maks followed so fast it was a wonder their atoms did n't mingle in a horrific explosion in the wormholes . But in fact Maks collided only with Yamashita 's big feet as the general flung himself off the slide , shouting : " Send us back ! Four hours earlier ! Send us back ! " <p> He jerked Maks out of the wormholes , threw himself back onto the slide , burying his face in his hands as the violet-white light flashed . Maks followed , and suddenly they were standing together , dizzy and disoriented , in the same office as before . But not the same . <p> The false fire burned quietly and the armoire stood closed , its mahogany front dully gleaming . On the walls the portraits of gentlemen in white wigs or high gleaming leather stocks and black coats and spotless shirtfronts hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , richly paneled wood painted a creamy enamel - slid abruptly into a slot and a big man strode in . <p> He was talking , his head half turned to direct the stream of words at a smaller man following him . Smith 's impetus carried him two full strides into the office before he saw what was awaiting him . <p> By then Yamashita had a pistol to his face . The smaller man suddenly hared off down the hall with Maks pounding in pursuit . The man stopped suddenly , whirled and raised one hand in a strange gesture , as if his empty palm were holding something , and then Maks slammed into him , a young heavy body hardened by training crashing into an aging bureaucratic wraith . <p> Gray collapsed on the floor , and Males dragged him unceremoniously back into the office by the heels . <p> He found Smith seated in a leather chair behind his desk , staring at Yamashita . They were about the same size , and Smith had never seen an impact pistol before , but he seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to sit still . <p> Males felt Gray 's pockets , found nothing ; checked his breathing , found him alive though unconscious , and left him lying on the carpet . As he turned , President Smith blinked twice and growled , " How 'd you find me ? Traced that damned gadget , did you ? " <p> Males tried to imagine himself walking into such a situation and realizing almost at once what it meant . The world , he felt - not for the first time - seemed to be full of people who were smarter than he was . " I 'd like to smoke , " Smith muttered . <p> Only Males knew what he meant ; Yamashita looked around for a kif pipe but saw none . Males opened a gold-chased humidor on the desk and presented their large captive with a cigar . Smith fished out a gold lighter , snapped it , and puffed slowly . <p> " It kills you , " he remarked . " We 've known that for a hundred years . Are you people friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Yamashita . He spoke so deliberately , with such emphasis , that translating was easy for Maks . " We 'll get to her in a moment . The crucial thing is this : you must rescind your order for preventive war , and do it now . " <p> Smith frowned . " Suppose I refuse ? " <p> " Do I look like a man who 'll take no for an answer ? " <p> Two more puffs on the cigar . " In short , I can have my war , but only if I die for it . " <p> " You 'll die for it anyway . Your defense system will not work adequately . You 'll die in your bunker , however deep it may be . " <p> Maks watched , under a curious impression that each man was holding cards , and that they were dealing them one by one . But there was no doubt who held the aces . <p> Smith sighed and looked at Gray stretched out on the floor . " He was the one who talked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant man . He killed that creature , too . Still , if you say the war policy 's unsuccessful .... " <p> He gestured at the armoire . " Open the doors , young man . If I must countermand the order , I must . Please stand back , the two of you , out of the picture . " <p> Yamashita turned away , but the corner of Maks 's left eye caught a slight movement where no movement should have been . Gray had raised himself slightly and a pistol slid into his hand so suddenly that it seemed a magic trick , as indeed it was - like a stage magician , he 'd had it up his sleeve . <p> Then his small body seemed to explode , almost noiselessly , like a rodent struck by a meteor . Hand steady after the shot , Maks turned his gun on Smith , who once more proved his intelligence by sitting absolutely still . <p> So , thought Maks without surprise , now I 'm a killer , too . <p> He bent and checked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far enough to expose the piston-and-cylinder device and the trigger that ejected the gun when Gray pressed his right elbow to his side . <p> Yamashita turned on Smith , his eyes like jet reflecting flame , but the president was unmoved . <p> " I did n't tell him to do it , " he pointed out . " He heard enough to know he was out of power , and for him that 's worse than death , so he played his last available card . " He puffed and gazed steadily at Yamashita . " Would you have done any different ? " <p> Maks touched the On icon that in a previous time-stream he would n't touch for another three hours . The screen sprang to life , bland and blue this time , awaiting orders . Smith edged his chair in front of it and spoke a series of commands with codewords the machine would n't have recognized in any voice but his . <p> Maks and Yamashita stood to either side against the wall , while the president reversed his orders , to the delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force . <p> Still Maks and Yamashita could not return to their own time . Maks knew by now that cleanup was as much a part of the job as the job itself . So hours elapsed , while Smith ordered the medical examiner to deliver Lian 's body and all specimens taken from it to the White House bunker . Empty time ticked on and smoke rose and turned the room blue , until baffled guards wheeled a big metal casket fuming with frozen carbon dioxide into the hallway outside the bunker and withdrew , leaving it behind . <p> Things stretched out so far that a rush of hot wind swept away the smoke of the President 's cigar and again set papers whirling off the desk . Smith had something new to stare at as two thuggi and a Darksider materialized in the room , plus translucent images of Maks and Yamashita that instantly faded and disappeared . <p> " Good gravy , " he muttered , adding to Yamashita , " I can honestly say that you , sir , have given me a day like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervising his minions in dispatching two ruined bodies to the Worldcity and turned to Smith . <p> " I regret to tell you , Mr. President , that the day is n't over . We have one more interesting experience for you . We 're going to another time . " <p> " By ' we ' you mean - " <p> " By ' we ' I mean us . " With triumph assured , even Yama relented , though only a hairsbreadth . <p> " Do n't worry , you 'll be returning to your White House very shortly . But - trust me - you 'll return a different man . " <p> GILDED DOORS swung open and Maks stepped back to allow Yamashita to enter Xian 's reception hall . He followed and stood at rigid attention while the General advanced and bowed from the waist . <p> " Rise , " said Xian . She stepped forward and extended a tiny hand . Yamashita bowed again , this time to kiss it . <p> " General , " she said in a voice unsteady with emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read in your fascinating report , you learned of a new and grave danger , an impending war in 2050 , and sent agents to explore the situation . " <p> " Yes , " said Yamashita coolly . " That 's exactly what happened . " Maks stared at him , thinking with a cynicism new to him : so this is how history is invented . The losers die , and the winners make up stories to suit themselves . <p> " And then you yourself led an expedition that ended the menace ! " <p> " Yes , Honored Controller . " <p> " And how did you deal with this - this President person ? " <p> " Our mediki inserted a control chip and an exploding poison pellet in his head , just as we do with convicts . If the nanomachines we 've scattered across his world report a sudden increase in radioactivity from any source whatever , the chip will blow his head off . The same if anybody tries to remove it . I advised him strongly to become his century 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the documents this young man " - he gestured at Maks - " saw in the Library of Congress two years later that he followed my advice . " <p> Xian clasped her hands as if in prayer . " Profoundly mysterious is the Great Tao ! " she exclaimed . <p> For the third time Yamashita bowed . " So all the sages have taught , Honored Controller . " <p> A robot servant rolled in a wagon with a tea caddy and Yamashita and Xian drank a ceremonial cup together . Then she pinned on new stars , until he had seven on each shoulder . <p> " I chose well when I chose you , " she congratulated herself . " Honored Controller , if I were the Senate , I would vote you the titles All Wise and Ever Victorious . Who but you made this triumph possible by commanding me to build the new wormholer ? " <p> Xian 's thin face now held a porcelain smile . She remembered perfectly well that the idea had been his . But how clever of him to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same spirit she accepted it . <p> " I 'll have them do just that , " she murmured . " I have n't had a new title in some time . And now , Honored Chief of Security , we permit you to go . <p> Back in the Palace of Justice , in Yamashita 's office , Yost pinned the insignia of a lieutenant in the Security Forces on Maks . Lian 's death had opened a slot , and Maks was the only candidate given serious consideration for it . Meanwhile Yamashita was cleaning things up again , barking orders into his mashing . <p> " Contact Calisto . All prisoners , regardless of sentence , will be held for life . Contact Admiral Hrka of the Space Service and inform him of the Controller 's order to liquidate all ' modified humans ' on Beta Charonis and anywhere else where that misbegotten experiment has been tried . I want a goddamn clean sweep , understand ? " <p> " Of course , Honored General . The orders have been sent , Honored General . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big desk to salute his commander . Yamashita rose slowly and saluted back . <p> " I like you , Hastings , " he said . " Not real bright , but reliable , and character means more than intelligence . Look around you . Once I was a young guy like you , and I knew where I wanted to end up - here . It took me a while , and it 'll take you a while . Others ' turns will come first . " <p> He nodded at Yost . " But keep at it , and one day you may sit here and hold incalculable mosh in your hands . <p> " Meanwhile , accept my congratulations and the thanks of all loyal people . You 've helped to save this world of ours - Xian and me and Yost and the whole Security Forces and the Worldcity and the Darksiders and everything else besides . " <p> Maks saluted and marched out of the room as Yost was saying , his normally soft voice raised a little so that Maks could n't help but overhear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little crowd had gathered , Maks 's fellow surfers , ready to hug him , pummel him , pour congratulations on him with a delicious mixture of joy and envy in their voices . Maia waited at the edge of the crowd , ready to reward him with a kiss , perhaps more . <p> Then why was he suddenly tasting blood ? Why did he have to bite his lips to keep from shouting , No , No , No ? <p> Author Affiliation
