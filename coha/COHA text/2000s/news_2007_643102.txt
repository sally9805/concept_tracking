<p> I COMMENCED my re-entry into competitive croquet on a sunny midsummer 's morning rife with misguided ambition and deceit . It was the opening day of the Meadow Club Invitational in Southampton , N.Y . In keeping with croquet custom , I wore white from cap to sneakers . My assigned first-round doubles partner was a silver-haired woman with an elastic band wrapped around her injured left wrist . <p> " Are you mean ? " she asked as we introduced ourselves outside the scorer 's tent . <p> I grinned , shaking my head from side to side . I informed her that although I had been named the United States Croquet Association co-rookie of the year in 1985 , I had n't played the game in 20 years . <p> " I do n't believe you , " she replied . <p> I quickly proceeded to allay her initial doubts by botching my every other shot , causing us to lose our match . We commiserated by exchanging air kisses and laughing at my rustiness and abject ineptitude . <p> " I believe you now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as per the tournament 's format of rotating doubles partners , I found myself paired with a woman from a prestigious up-island country club who sported a white Stetson hat . I demonstrated what croquet players call " brain deadness " by committing a strategic error halfway through the match . My mistake ultimately proved to be inconsequential , but before that became clear , the Stetson-hatted woman berated me in no uncertain terms . <p> " You do n't do that ! " she screeched . " Never , ever do that ! " <p> Another contestant said later that I should 've just walked off the court . Instead , I held tongue and temper in check , and kept on playing en route to yet another defeat . I distinctly remember saying nothing at all when the Stetson-hatted woman shook my hand and uttered a perfunctory thank you after the match . But as I found out the following day , she trotted off to complain to the tournament director that I had responded by calling her an unprintable word . <p> This nasty little contretemps reminded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wicket life . " A far cry from the leisurely game that many people play in their backyards , it is a ritualized war game that combines elements of golf , pool and chess . Unlike the similar 19th-century vintage international version , the American version is played according to even more mind-numbingly complex rules codified in 1977 by a sportsman and bon vivant named Jack Osborn who has since died . <p> If croquet may never be as popular as bowling and basketball , it is enjoying a miniboom fueled by baby boomers . The croquet association says it has 300 registered clubs with over 3,000 individual members , about a 50 percent increase from two decades ago . Snob appeal notwithstanding , participation is relatively inexpensive and democratic . A decent mallet costs about $400 , and anyone can enter tournaments for fees of $400 or less . <p> " The great thing about croquet is that it 's a social sport in which men and women are basically equal , " Archie Peck , director for croquet at the National Croquet Center in West Palm Beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadow Club . " In any given match , anything can happen . " <p> Indeed , croquet is much more about finesse and mental acumen than raw muscle power . A standard championship court measures 84 feet by 105 feet , and has the same closely mown " fast " surface as a grass tennis court . There are four balls played in an alternating sequence . The blue and black balls are always pitted against the red and yellow balls . In singles , you play both balls in your respective pair ; in doubles , each member of the team plays one of the balls in the pair . <p> The object of the game is to hit both your balls through a course of six wickets , first in a clockwise direction and then in a counterclockwise direction . You earn one point and one extra stroke by making a wicket . You earn two extra strokes by hitting your ball into another ball . But you are prohibited from hitting into that same ball again until you remove your " deadness " by making your next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the wickets , you can win the game outright by knocking them against the center peg before your opponent does for a total of 26 points . <p> Two more crucial features distinguish competitive croquet from 9-wicket backyard croquet . In backyard games , the wickets are made of wire , and shaped in wide half-moons . In competitive croquet , the wickets are made of cast iron , and shaped in rectangles only an eighth of an inch wider than the diameter of the balls . In addition , there is a time limit of 90 minutes a game and a 45-second shot clock , which pressure a player 's shot making and decision making . <p> My ambitions in re-entering competitive croquet were both athletic and fraternal . Back in the fall , I 'd played in a poker tournament with two drinking buddies : a part-time professional nicknamed Reraise , who gambled like a Dostoyevsky character ; and his 25-year-old son , the Kid , who was croquet association rookie of the year in 1999 . The Kid and I decided it would be fun to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is scheduled to be at the Meadow Club in October . We thought that playing together in the Meadow Club Invitational would be a perfect warm-up . <p> The plot thickened like a Brandy Alexander when Reraise was asked to serve as tournament co-chairman of the invitational . In that capacity , he agreed to give a Thursday night cocktail party , one of several croquet-related social events that included a clambake , a barbecue and a dinner dance . He also lobbied for me to be put in the championship flight so I could play with the Kid . But the tournament director , Mr. Peck , insisted on assigning me to the first flight because of my extended absence from the game . <p> The ensuing events confirmed Mr. Peck 's observation that anything can happen in croquet . On the competitive front , I turned in a disappointing performance , losing 3 of 4 doubles and 3 of 6 singles matches . I did best the eventual first flight runner-up in a preliminary match . I also twice defeated an experienced contestant who beat the eventual first-flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little solace in my latter two victories since they came against an opponent about half my size and half again my age . <p> The Kid also played below expectations in the championship flight . After cruising through the prelims , he racked up a 23-3 lead in the second round of the sudden-death elimination matches . Then he committed a strategic error that led to a 26-24 defeat . The fact that his opponent was a distant cousin of mine who was staying at his father 's house during the tournament made him feel completely " brain dead . " <p> Ironically , we both scored on the social front at Reraise 's cocktail party . Reraise informed me that the Stetson-hatted woman who 'd filed a false report against me may have previously blackballed the Kid and him from playing croquet at her prestigious up-island country club . He still welcomed her to his cocktail party with a kiss on the cheek . But after three days of the wicket life , I was filled with righteous indignation . I pulled the woman aside , and said I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less an unprintable word . <p> " I 'm not just dreaming this , young man ! " she retorted , and stomped off . <p> In retrospect , I reckon I should have shouted out a thank you . It 's not often that a 55-year-old former rookie of the year gets called a " young " man . But seconds after this second contretemps , I spied the Kid gazing longingly at his girlfriend . Her unaffected elegance and beauty seemed to inspire him to abandon the air of entitled indifference he usually projected . <p> " We 're still going to the Nationals , " the Kid hollered as Reraise joined the three of us for a toast . " And we 're going to win ! " <p> #
