<p> Last year , U.S. travelers were feasting on airfares that , on average , were the lowest ever when adjusted for inflation . <p> No more . Last week , the USA 's big airlines tacked $50 onto their unrestricted coach fares in most markets . Few people actually buy those high-end tickets , but most discount fares are set as a percentage of those unrestricted fares . So , such a large jump in those benchmark prices hits the average traveler in the wallet . <p> That 's the most recent in a string of targeted and general fare increases , including a small but telling industrywide increase in early March triggered by Southwest Airlines , the king of the discounters . Taken together , the fare increases have produced a double-digit percentage rise in the cost of the average airline ticket since fall . <p> Fare prices are likely to go higher still , perhaps a lot higher . <p> Strong travel demand , plus the airline industry 's newfound restraint in adding flying capacity , are giving U.S. carriers greater ability to name their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means bargains are scarcer and trips costlier , it also means domestic carriers have at least a shot at financial stability , which has eluded them since recession and terrorism in 2001 knocked their business into a depression . <p> Andrew Winterton , an executive at consultant American Express Business Travel , says airlines have entered a prolonged period of more fare increases , fewer fare sales and low limits on the number of tickets sold at the lowest published price . <p> " If airlines are going to stay in business , they have to begin pricing for profitability , " Winterton says . <p> Sally Gray , a broadcast equipment saleswoman from Saratoga , Calif. , says she was shocked when she tried to book a flight from San Jose , Calif. , to Sioux Falls , S.D. , at the last minute . She could n't get a seat for less than $1,050 round trip . " I did n't want to permanently buy the seat , I just wanted to sit in it for a couple of hours , " she said . Still , Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The run-up in fares can be calculated in various ways . Among them : <p> *The average domestic fare paid per mile flown was up 12.5% in February from a year earlier , when fares were the lowest ever in inflation-adjusted terms . A 2,000-mile trip that cost , on average , $229 in February 2005 , was up to $258 this past February . <p> *The price of the typical one-way business fare between Chicago and Washington was $339 in early April , up 71% from a year earlier , according to price-tracker Harrell Associates . The demise in January of discounter Independence Air , based at Washington Dulles , influenced that jump . But the defunct carrier was not a factor on many routes , such as Detroit-Los Angeles , where the business fare was $599 in early April , up 29% from a year earlier . <p> *A broader sampling of business travel fares done by American Express Business Travel shows that the average one-way business fare rose steadily through most of 2005 . <p> For 329 popular domestic routes , it reached $223 in the October-December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter of the year . <p> *Southwest Airlines , the giant discounter popular with leisure travelers , pushed its average one-way fare above the psychologically important $100 mark on March 10 when it added $2 to $4 each way to most fares . <p> It also raised the absolute cap on its fares by $10 , to $309 one way . <p> Turnaround <p> From the industry perspective , air travel prices are rebounding from a long , deep funk . Average fares  --  expressed in terms of yield , or cents paid for every mile they flew a passenger  --  had been on a dangerously downward trend for the airlines throughout 2004 . <p> The bottom fell out with Delta 's introduction in January 2005 of " Simplifares , " a flatter , lower price structure that other airlines followed , in most cases reluctantly . <p> At the peak of the airlines ' most recent profit cycle in February 1999 , the airlines received an average of 15 cents for each mile they flew a passenger . But by February 2005 , the big U.S. carriers were getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off nearly a quarter from the peak . <p> A ticket for a 2,000-mile round trip that earned carriers an average fare of $293 in February 1999 brought in $229 in February 2005 . <p> Salvation for the airlines began arriving late last summer , and it came from an improbable source : higher fuel prices . <p> By mid-August last year , jet fuel prices had already risen nearly 50% for the year , to around $80 a barrel . Then the Gulf Coast hurricanes temporarily knocked out a third of the nation 's supply of jet fuel and other refined products . Jet fuel prices spiked above $125 a barrel . <p> For airlines , the frightening run-up in fuel prices had an unexpected positive impact . Out of apparent desperation , carriers gingerly began probing the willingness of customers and competitors to accept small fare increases . Travelers , perhaps softened by their experiences at the gasoline pump , did n't flinch . <p> Also , No. 4 Northwest , which consistently had scuttled earlier fare increases by refusing to follow , fell in line with competitors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly raised fares or reduced the number of seats in their lowest-price categories . <p> Higher post-Katrina fares marked the industry 's first success in five years in pushing through general fare increases . <p> Mark McLain , chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association unit at Northwest Airlines , says the fuel price shock last summer gave carriers public relations cover to do what labor leaders  --  and basic economics  --  had been demanding they do for years : raise prices to try to cover costs . <p> " From a purely capitalist standpoint , high fuel prices have been good for the ( traditional ) carriers , " McLain says . <p> Laura Wright , Southwest 's chief financial officer , says she 's been surprised at how understanding consumers have been and how resilient the U.S. economy is . " With the higher energy prices , the economy overall has stayed stronger than we would have thought , " she says . <p> Peter Belobaba , a researcher at MIT 's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics , calls the dramatic rise in fuel costs a godsend for airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have tried to push fares so high so fast . <p> " They had to do something about their prices , or they would not have continued to exist much longer , " he says . <p> After collectively losing more than $40 billion in the last five years , U.S. airlines are widely expected to be profitable in 2007 , thanks to higher fares and continued aggressive cost cutting . <p> Profit possibilities scrutinized <p> Whether the industry can be profitable for 2006 remains in doubt . Wall Street had been looking for the industry to lose $1 billion to $2 billion this year . But that was before oil rose into the high $60s in the past three weeks . <p> That adds to airlines ' operating costs , but it also gives them more reason to raise prices . <p> An analysis performed for USA TODAY by Sabre Airline Solutions shows how much economic pressure the airlines are under to get their prices up . <p> To break even , this year 's industrywide average domestic fare  --  including business and leisure fares  --  needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in the third quarter of last year , when that average domestic fare was about $148 . <p> " We 're only about halfway there , measuring from the third quarter of last year , " says Vijay Bathija , a senior principal with the consulting arm of the Sabre Group , operator of the Sabre computer reservations system and online travel seller Travelocity.com . <p> Based on bookings data ( not actual sales ) , " we think that the average domestic fare right now is only up somewhere between 10% and 13% from the fall . " <p> Whether airlines can successfully push the average price to the break-even point is n't certain , but Bathija says " at the end of the day , they have to get close to that . " <p> Consumers might be feeling the bite , but they 're not foregoing air travel in measurable numbers . The average commercial jet flying across the USA these days is fuller than ever . <p> In January and February , the big carriers reported filling the highest percentage of seats ever for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . For all of 2005 , the USA 's biggest airlines filled 77% of their seats , a record according to the Air Transport Association ( ATA ) . Last week , most of the big carriers reported record March load factors near or above the 80% mark . <p> A key factor in keeping flights fuller and fares higher is the industry 's success in controlling the number of plane seats travelers have to choose from . Until recently , a huge oversupply of flying capacity  --  seats  --  prevented carriers from pricing tickets high enough to cover their costs . <p> But the big airlines ' domestic capacity , measured in available seat miles , rose only 1% in 2005 , while the number of domestic flights fell 2.3% . The biggest drop in capacity came in the fourth quarter , and the trend is continuing this year . This summer , the ATA expects industry capacity to be down about 2.6% from last summer . <p> Gordon Kennedy and his colleagues at a Maryland-based defense contractor are among the few who thus far have begun cutting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips , and their company is investing in video and Internet conferencing technology , to reduce employee trips and save money . <p> " When I budgeted for travel this year , I increased airfare by 25% , " says Kennedy , an operations manager who lives in Stone Mountain , Ga . But his overall travel budget did n't grow . " Something had to give . So I 'll take 30 trips this year instead of the usual 40 . " <p> Timothy Burke , director of global marketing at packaging firm Ampac , says he understands the airlines ' economic predicament . Higher fares wo n't affect his business travel decisions , says Burke , who flies 250,000 miles from his home base in Denver . <p> " If anything , I wish all airlines could impose increases that would allow them to restore profitability and level the playing field , " Burke says . " Everyone deserves to make money , protect jobs and assure the long-term viability of their company . " <p> Similarly , Steven Dobie , a Motorola systems architect from Austin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaffected . " Air travel is no different than paying higher prices at the grocery store because of increased ... costs , " he says .
