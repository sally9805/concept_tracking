Sure they 're all round , but each globular cluster offers a different view through a telescope . // BY STEVE COE // In the deep-sky menagerie , nothing excites new observers more than globular star clusters . It 's easy to see why . Many shine brightly enough to be seen even from urban settings . But when observed from a dark site , these objects explode with detail . * Astronomers classify two star-cluster types : open and globular . Open ones lie within our galaxy 's spiral arms . You 'll see them along the glowing path of the Milky Way . The richest open star clusters contain hundreds of young stars . Globular clusters appear as spheres of stars that took their shape when the Milky Way formed , 13 billion years ago . The largest globulars contain a million or so stars and measure about 300 light-years across .

Because of its distance , M75 looks compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 Stars . KEN SIARKIEWICZ/ADAM BLOCK/NOAO/AURA/NSF // Globular clusters also differ from open clusters because globulars lie in a region outside the Milky Way 's disk called the galactic halo . Open clusters move with the arms of the Milky Way while globulars lie some distance above or below our galaxy 's plane . Some of the most prominent globulars are found a short distance from the Milky Way 's centerline , where the dust does not dim this distant starlight. // TARGETTHESE SUMMER GLOBULARS // Because globular clusters orbit the Milky Way 's center , deep-sky observers will see the most globulars when they look there . The constellations Sagittarius , Scorpius , and Ophiuchus are packed with them . Globular clusters represent one class of celestial object on which you can improve your observing skills and telescope use , regardless of the scope 's aperture . Two features to look for are dark markings within the cluster and long , curving chains of stars . And note if you detect any color in the cluster stars . Do n't just " take a peek . " Spend some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scorpion If you 're just starting out observing globulars , stick to bright ones . M4 lies near the bright red giant star Antares ( Alpha a Scorpii ) . If it 's dark enough to show Scorpius ' entire fish-hook shape , then a finder scope or binoculars will show this globular cluster in the same field of view with Antares . And under the darkest sky , sharpeyed observers can see M4 without optics . Photograph M4 Magnitude : 5.6 Distance : 7,200 light-years Apparent diameter : 3 ' M4 sits 1.3 west of Antares ( Alpha a Scorpii ) . From a dark site , you 'll see M4 easily without optical aid . Through a 6-inch or larger telescope , this cluster shows lots of detail . GEORGE SEITZ/ADAM BLOCK/NOAO/AURA/NSF THE CONSTELLATIONS Scorpius the Scorpion , Ophiuchus the Serpent-bearer , and Sagittarius the Archer contain lots of globular clusters because the Milky Way 's center lies in this direction . Use this finder chart to locate some of the brightest summer globulars. // Through a 6-inch scope at 65x , M4 appears bright , large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " feature and a bright lane of stars across the cluster 's middle . Averted vision ( looking slightly away from a faint object ) resolves more stars that " fill in " this glowing globe . At 105x , I counted 33 individual stars . Through an 11-inch scope at 200x , this beautiful cluster appeared brighter in the middle , and I resolved 48 stars . The outer sections show several delicate chains of stars that curve out and away from M4 to meld into the Milky Way nearby . Next , try for a less-famous globular near Antares . NGC 6144 is faint , small , and slightly elongated ( I estimate the ratio of its dimensions as 1.2 to 1 ) . Its center is a bit brighter than its outer regions . Through my 11-inch scope at 200x , I resolved only 10 stars . This cluster has a low surface brightness , so it does n't stand out well from the Milky Way 's background glow . Photograph M55 Magnitude : 6.3 JB distance : 17,300 light-years Apparent diameter : 19 ' M55 IN SAGITTARIUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for observers in northern latitudes . Look 8 east of magnitude 2.6 Zeta ( ? ) Sagittarii for this cluster . M55 appears loose because of its size , nearly two-thirds the Full Moon 's diameter . LEEC COOMBS M22 Magnitude : 5.1 Distance : 10,400 light-years Apparent diameter : 32 ' M22 in Sagittarius ranks as the sky 's third-brightest globular cluster behind only Omega Centauri ( NGC 5139 ) and 47 Tucanae ( NGC 104 ) . M22 lies 2.5 northeast of Lambda ( ? ) Sagittarii . Magnitude : 6.7 Distance : 16,000 light-yeal Apparent diameter : 16 ' M12 in Ophiuchus looks similar to M10 , except for being slightly smaller and a bit fainter . From a dark site , a sharp-eyed observer may glimpse Ml2 without optical aid . // In the Serpent-bearer North and east of Scorpius lies Ophiuchus . Let 's start there with MlO , which shines at magnitude 6.6 . This cluster is unmistakable in binoculars or a finder scope . A globular nearly as bright , magnitude 6.7 , M12 , lies 3 northwest of MlO . Through a 13-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , much brighter in the middle , and well-resolved . Moving up to 22Ox shows 110 stars . Look for two prominent lines of stars that extend from the center and loop into chains that curve in opposite directions , like a lawn sprinkler . An llth-magnitude orange star sits on the cluster 's north side . Use averted vision to fill in the cluster . NGC 6284 shines at magnitude 8.8 , is small , round , and has a bright and compressed middle . I 've seen it through an 11x80 finder scope . Through my 13-inch , I could n't resolve it into stars at 10Ox . When I increased the magnification to 33Ox , however , I saw 10 stars . Resolution still was n't easy . Averted vision helped a lot , making the cluster grow in size and resolving a few stars in the core . This globular lies 46,000 light-years away , on the far side of the galaxy from our solar system , so it 's tough to resolve individual stars . NGC 6325 glows feebly at magnitude 10.7 . This globular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle at 10Ox through my 13-inch . Few field stars lie in the vicinity of this globular because of nearby dark nebulae . On a great night , I noticed a little elongation ( about 1.2 by 1 ) along a north-south line . I could n't resolve individual stars at either 22Ox or 33Ox . In the Archer The Milky Way 's center lies within the borders of Sagittarius , so let 's complete our tour of globular clusters with some examples from the constellation of the Archer . // TEN MORE GLOBULARS YOU 'LL ENJOY // M28 lies 1 northwest of Kaus Borealis ( Lambda ? Sagittarii ) . This magnitude 6.8 cluster is bright , large , round , and has a bright middle . Through a 6-inch scope at 65x , I resolved no stars . Switching to 135x allowed me to resolve five stars consistently ; another eight came and went as the seeing changed . With averted vision , I noticed a bizarre effect : As I looked at the cluster 's outer edge , different stars across the face of this globular appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . Even from a mediocre observing site , I saw M28 in an 11x80 finder scope . At 10Ox through the 13-inch Newtonian , this cluster looked large , bright , and round , with increased brightness in the middle . Raising the power to 22Ox really shows this globular at its best . I resolved 21 stars constantly , and averted vision revealed another 50 or so tiny star points . NGC 6642 measures roughly 10 ' across and shines at magnitude 9.1 . It appeared large , round , and bright ( brightest in the middle ) through the 11-inch at 125x . Moving up to 20Ox helps the resolution . Instead of five stars , I could hold 10 with direct vision and another 20 using averted vision , but they were right at the edge of visibility . This cluster contains numerous faint stars . I just ca n't observe summer globulars without spending some time at one of my favorite deep-sky objects , M22 . It was the first globular discovered ( but mistaken for a nebula ) and is the third-brightest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in a finder scope , it 's the fuzzy thing not quite 3 east-northeast of M28 . Both globulars lie above the top of Sagittarius ' " teapot " asterism . Photograph Magnitude : 7.8 Distance : 20,900 light-years Apparent diameter : 13 ' M107 in Ophiuchus lies 2.7 south-southwest of magnitude 2.6 Zeta ( ? ) Ophiuchi . M107 contains more than two dozen variable stars and measures roughly 80 light-years across . M10 Magnitude : 6.6 Distance : 14,300 lignt-year Apparent diameter : 20 ' MIO in Ophiuchus lies in an area devoid of bright stars . Find it 10.6 due east of magnitude 2.7 Yed Prior ( Delta d Ophiuchi ) or 1 west of 5th-magnitude 30 Ophiuchi . Do n't confuse MIO with Ml 2 , which lies a bit more than 3 northwest of MIO. // Through a 6-inch scope at 4Ox , magnitude 5.1 M22 looks brilliant , large , round , and somewhat compressed . At 135x , 47 stars resolved with direct vision , and I saw another 20 or so with averted vision . A prominent chevron of stars lies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 22Ox , I can resolve 64 stars in the northwest quadrant of M22 . That makes the total number of resolvable stars around 250 . Remember , just because all globulars are round does n't mean they all look the same . Each star cluster offers something different through the telescope . Because these objects lie in the same part of the sky , you can compare and contrast them by moving from one to the next . I hope this short tour gets you started observing this fascinating class of deep-sky objects - there 's plenty to see in these beautiful and distant globes of stars .
