Many men are intimidated by it , and women are concerned they 'll become vibrator-dependent . But if more people used vibrators , they 'd have mind-blowing sex . " - Yvonne K. Fulbright BERMAN : " This jells with advice I give couples . It 's always nice to include the partner so he feels less threatened . I also like how she addresses the concerns of women who fear they might get addicted . " TIP : " Talk about sex , think about sex , and experiment .
