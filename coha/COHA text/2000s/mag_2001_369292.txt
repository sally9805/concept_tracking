Raymond Carver was only 50 when he died , in 1988 , of lung cancer . Those who knew him personally mourned , and continue to mourn , the loss of a warm and generous friend , a man whose hard early life  --  periods of dead-end jobs and poverty , severe alcoholism  --  had somehow made him gentle . Readers aware of him only from his books have missed him too , for Carver had , during the 12 years preceding his death , virtually reinvented the American short story . <P> His acclaim stemmed from four collections : Will You Please Be Quiet , Please ? ( 1976 ) ; What We Talk About When We Talk About Love ( 1981 ) ; Cathedral ( 1983 ) ; and Where I 'm Calling From ( 1988 ) . Carver 's stories also became a staple in Esquire during the 1970s and the New Yorker in the ' 80s . His voice  --  spare , understated , unsentimental  --  and his typical subject matter  --  moments of truth in the lives of hard-luck men and women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  became immediately recognizable . Carver resisted the trend toward gentrification in U.S. fiction , the Jamesian notion that only those with fine-tuned sensibilities and no money worries have the leisure to mess up their lives in interesting ways . Carver could write about life 's losers without any condescension because he had often felt he was one of them . <P> His stories appeared so simple and effortless that many aspiring writers decided to turn them out themselves . These admirers might get the props right  --  say , a mobile home with linoleum on the floor and an opened bottle of gin on the kitchen table  --  but not the magic that Carver could work with such material , not the sense of enormous import lurking in the pauses of desultory conversations . <P> Reviewers and critics dubbed Carver and his epigones Minimalists , a term the author disliked . His reasons for doing so extended beyond the normal artistic resentment at being pigeonholed . Carver knew , as others have discovered in the past few years , that heavy excisions were performed on his early stories by Gordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70s and then at Knopf during the preparation of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love . That book , with 17 terse stories crammed into 159 pages , solidified Carver 's reputation but left him feeling that he had ceded too much control to his editor . ( He later restored Lish 's cuts to two of the stories and included them in Where I 'm Calling From . ) Carver devotees portray Lish as the villain of this piece , an overreaching editor who bullied an uncertain beginning writer . Lish 's defenders argue that he did for Carver 's fiction what Ezra Pound did for T.S . Eliot 's The Waste Land , i.e. , cut out the fat to expose the essential genius within the work .
