I had always asumed that a broken heart was just a metaphor , a clich of country music and romance novels . So I was as surprised as anyone to learn last week that doctors now consider it a real medical event , one that can kill . <P> The news comes from a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine , in which physicians at Johns Hopkins described a group of 18 mostly older women and one man who developed serious heart problems after experiencing a sudden emotional shock , such as the death of a loved one , or , in the case of one 60-year-old woman , a surprise birthday party . <P> What surprised the doctors who examined these patients was that none of them had actually suffered a heart attack . Indeed , few had any signs of heart disease at all . Yet at least five of the 19  --  and perhaps more  --  would have died without treatment , according to Dr. Ilan Wittstein , the cardiologist who led the study . <P> What was going on ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues measured the levels of catecholamines  --  the family of stress hormones that includes adrenalin  --  that their patients were producing . In each case they found high levels of stress hormones  --  up to 34 times as great as normal levels and two to three times as great as those typically seen during severe heart attacks . <P> It 's still unclear whether the hormones caused the cardiac problems or were caused by them . Nor can doctors explain why women 's hearts seem more vulnerable than men 's . " Men typically produce higher levels of catecholamines in response to a stressful event than women do , " Wittstein says . " So if you had to guess , you 'd guess that men would have this problem more than women . " <P> The good news about the condition doctors are calling the broken-heart syndrome is that it 's reversible  --  provided the initial shock is n't too great . And repeat occurrences appear to be uncommon , no matter how many surprise birthday parties they throw you .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
