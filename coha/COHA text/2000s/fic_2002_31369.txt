Graham Keep , West March , England , 1542 sixty years later .... Sisters . As women , they should be compliant , deferring to their fathers and husbands . Should they lack both , then their brothers shall guide them and care for them . They should be grateful for his loving and kind protection ; for the great pains he took in administering their future . Unfortunately for Ridley Graham he was not blessed with such paragons of sisters . Ungrateful , devious , argumentative , surly ... well , one of them was surly ; these were all words that described his sisters , but never compliant or appreciative . Ridley paused outside the door to his sisters ' bedchamber . He smoothed the fine whiskers of his beard thoughtfully , then adjusted the small starched ruff at his neck . It was nearly noon and he 'd seen neither of his sisters nor his stepmother today . They were apparently closeted up together in their chambers , plotting against him . This avoidance did not bode well for what was to come . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridley 's birth , Mother had suffered a succession of miscarriages . When finally she began birthing live babies again Father had come to view children differently . He loved and coddled his next three children . Never did they suffer the lash as Ridley had ; never were they forced to bear Father 's mockery or derision . And this was the result . Spoiled and petulant , believing they had some say in their future . Ridley knocked briefly and entered before being granted admittance . He paused again just inside the door to examine the scene before him . Fayth , Ridley 's youngest sister , slouched in a chair near the fire . The light from the fire picked out the reddish strands in her hair , making it appear auburn rather than the drab brown it was . She looked more like a beardless lad in a kirtle than a lass overripe for marriage . Fayth 's head swiveled around , her dark eyes narrowing on Ridley before turning dismissively back to contemplate the flames . Ridley 's lips tightened . She 'd not always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd leeched onto some ruffian , claiming to love him  --  but Ridley knew she was scrambling to find a man of her choosing before Father died . Unfortunately  --  for her , that is  --  her paramour had been murdered in a raid . She knew the fate Ridley had planned for her and fought against it . Insufferable little bitch . He would beat that defiance out of her spine if necessary . But not now . He turned , facing the other occupants of the room . Two women and a man . " Father , " Ridley murmured , bowing his head to Caroline 's priest , Father Jasper Graham  --  a distant cousin on their father 's side . The tall , thin man approached Ridley , hands tucked into the sleeves of his fine green robes . " This is not what Lord Graham wanted  --  you know this . " Father Jasper 's head was long and thin like his body , the cheeks hollowed . His large eyes were haunted , as if he found no solace in God 's calling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Lord Annan . " Ridley shot a hard look at his young stepmother , Mona , a small woman of dark , inscrutable beauty . Her black eyes held his , condemning . Then she put her back to him and resumed brushing Caroline 's long blond hair . " My lord , " Father Jasper implored , moving in front of Ridley , blocking his view of Mona and Caroline . Ridley hated the priest . He 'd always championed Caroline , because of the vocation she strove for . Like-minded confederates , they were . The priest was probably the only person who knew Caroline 's thoughts . " Caroline does not wish to wed . Lord Graham asked you to care for your sisters , see to their happiness . The Lord expects you to honor your father 's wishes . " Tipping his head back , Ridley stared up at the priest , annoyed at the man 's manner . How dare he attempt to call forth a higher authority . Ridley was the highest authority on Graham lands now . And he was sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste . " I have a duty  --  as does every member of this family . " He circled the priest and went to stand behind Caroline . Mona melted away . Pale green eyes gazed at him from the mirror 's distorted reflection , as if she had two faces , one slightly offsetting and obscuring the other . " I am fulfilling my duty , " Ridley said . " It is time you did yours . Alliances are essential for survival and I have but two sisters and many alliances to forge . You 'll not deny me my right to give you away in marriage . " His sister was most unattractive  --  manly in every way , from her long face to her oversized body . She put on no airs , was aware of her defects , and yet still carried herself with an innate confidence that other , more beautiful , women could n't feign . It was unseemly . " Look at you , " Ridley said , his lip curling . " You hag . You should thank me for arranging this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . He has promised not to beat you and to allow you many liberties . The messenger said the ladies find his looks pleasing . " Caroline showed no emotion , her face serene , expressionless . He was sure she practiced it in front of the mirror , this look of a martyr , of the lamb going to the slaughter . " You know what they call you ? The Pious Graham Mare . He will not trouble you overmuch with his attentions . Perhaps he will get a few heirs on you , but he will surely seek his pleasure elsewhere . " " Who has called Caroline such a thing ? " Mona asked , sliding back into Ridley 's field of vision . " Suitors , who want our wealth and name , and will wed a dray horse to get it . " " Oh , you are foul , " Fayth hissed behind him . " If father were alive  --  " " Father is dead ! " Ridley nearly trembled with fury . " I am the master now . I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you will be penniless . " " I choose poverty , then . " Cool as water and fair as spring was Caroline 's voice , like the Virgin herself addressing her people . " I will go with Father Jasper and enter a convent . " She rose to her full , unnatural height , towering over everyone in the room except the priest . Father Jasper joined Caroline , placing a comforting hand on her shoulder . Ridley shook his head , laughing at himself . He 'd set himself up for that one . " Sorry , Carrie , you 'll not get off that easily . You are to wed Lord Annan in a fortnight . " She stared down her nose at him , managing not to look the least bit haughty . Only saintly . She did not speak . Ridley grew impatient . It was always this way . Caroline could weigh him down in silence . He wanted to know her intentions and she would reveal nothing until she was ready . She was no saint , but a conniving demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't marry me off to the highest bidder . Father said I could marry as I pleased . He promised . " Ridley rounded on his little sister , as diminutive as Caroline was tall . Fayth 's fists balled at her sides and her face flushed . She was the complete opposite of Caroline , unable to hide her emotions  --  or stop a single thought from escaping her lips . Giving in to the urge that had plagued him for the past five years , Ridley slapped Fayth , knocking her flat . Mona screamed and Caroline gasped . Ridley whirled in time to catch the horror he 'd surprised Caroline into revealing before she quickly masked it with calm reproach . She went to Fayth and knelt beside her , speaking softly . Fayth 's breath hissed through her nose and teeth , murder in her eyes . But she had shut her mouth . Perhaps force was the way to deal with her . " Ridley , please , " Mona said , taking his arm and steering him toward the door . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed her to lead him , smiling to himself . He looked down into his stepmother 's beautiful face , her troubled brow , her deep velvety eyes . Always the peacemaker . He 'd been in love with her since his father had brought her home and presented her to the family . She was a Musgrave and common , but still , he had seethed with jealousy , imagining her in Father 's bed  --  the old skeletal frame of Hugh Graham rutting on her . It had made him sick . And mad with want for her . Now Father was gone . He could not marry his father 's widow , but he could keep her as his mistress , if only ... " I know their manner vexes you , " Mona whispered . " But you must not blame them . Your father indulged them and allowed their natures to grow strong . They 'll be a match for any man and since their wit is sharp , perhaps they 'll win respect , if wed to the right men . " " Respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time for them to become meek and gentle in preparation for marriage . My rule is nothing compared to an irate husband 's . They will be beaten dead within the first year of marriage . Caroline will certainly hold her own in a fight , but will end up the worse for it  --  mark me . " " You 're right , of course . I will speak to them . I think this marriage to Lord Annan is a fine thing and Caroline will come to see that , too . " " Tell Caroline that if she refuses , I 'll give her the poverty she desires . She 'll live alone in the tower . Under guard . She can live out her days as a dried-up old nun if she wishes  --  but she will do it alone . I 'll not even allow her Father Jasper . " Mona nodded . She started to turn away but he caught her arm . " Tell her Lord Annan is a papist ... and that she can bring Father Jasper . " " Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pulled her into the corridor . " You can save them both , you know . " He dragged her against his chest , burying his face in her hair , inhaling the musky scent of her . " Tell me where it is and I will send them both abroad . I 'll buy Caroline 's way into the finest convent and Fayth can marry a plowboy if she desires . It 's all in your hands . " She wrenched free , her face twisted in revulsion . " You 'll never have it , so long as I live and breathe ! " She scurried back into the room , closing the door behind her . Caroline stared at herself in the mirror , trying not to give in to the terror gripping her heart . She 'd known this day would come . Though Father had promised her she would never have to marry if she did n't wish to , and Ridley had mouthed his assurances that he would force no unwanted unions upon them , she 'd known Ridley was not to be trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Caro-line 's senior , he had nevertheless been her hero when she was a child  --  that is , until she discovered how he despised his three siblings . Caroline , Fayth , and their little brother Wesley had all been close to each other and to their father . But Ridley had stood on the outskirts of the family ; even Mother had rejected him . For years it seemed to Caroline that Ridley was only biding his time , enduring Father 's instruction and advice with a patronizing smile , waiting for the day he could take charge and do things his way . And now Ridley was Lord Graham . The day Father died Ridley had installed a reformed minister in the castle 's chapel , displacing Father Jasper . He 'd been trying to force conversion on Caroline . Wesley had capitulated , still retaining some residual hero worship toward his big brother , and wanting to believe everything was for the best . But Fayth and Caroline held out . And now they were both to be married off in political alliances . Mona returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plait . " Lord Annan is Catholic . Ridley says you may take Father Jasper to Scotland . " The silence drew out , heavy . " It is true that some husbands are harsh , " Mona said . " But for most women matrimony opens a door to many possibilities . " " It did n't for you , " Fayth said . Mona 's mouth thinned . " You 're father 's and my ... relationship was not typical . " Caroline did n't know if this were true or not , but she did know her father had treated his children far better than his wives . Caroline 's mother had cried incessantly for years , then one day just stopped , and never shed another tear . She stopped speaking or running the household . Caroline had been forced to take over while Mother spent her days in the solar , creating tapestries that depicted horrifying scenes of death and dismemberment . When she 'd finally passed away , quietly in her sleep , it had been a relief to all , most especially Father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not cower from Lord Annan . She would not cry . Mona leaned close and whispered , " Surely marriage is a better thing than remaining under Ridley 's rule ? He will force you to repudiate the true religion , else imprison you . Your new husband will allow you to worship as you please . His people say he is fair . " " He 's a Maxwell , " Caroline said . " The Maxwells loathe us  --  his people wo n't accept me . " " You ca n't do this , " Fayth said , impassioned . Fayth had always thrown herself wholeheartedly into the feud with the Maxwells , but since her betrothed had been murdered by one , her hate consumed her . " Run away ! I 'll help you . Anything  --  death is better than sharing a bed with a Maxwell ! " The blood feud between the Maxwells and the Grahams had been thriving for generations . Caroline was n't even sure what had started it , only that they had raided and murdered each other since she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her husband would rape her and be unfaithful . She would live in a hovel , dress in rags . Hysteria churned in her gut , but did n't show on the surface . Mona touched Caroline 's shoulders . " This marriage will bring peace to the clans . No more raids , no more death . You will finally heal a wound that has been open and bleeding for three score years . " Caroline blinked . Mona raised her voice , for Fayth 's benefit now . " Besides ... the Maxwell man Ridley holds for ransom is nothing as I expected ... he seems quite civilized . He is Lord Annan 's brother , Sir Patrick . I 've spoken to him  --  he tells me Lord Annan is very honorable . The ransom Ridley set for Sir Patrick 's return is too steep for Lord Annan . His brother 's safe return is all he requested when negotiating the marriage . " Fayth snorted , then jerked , touching her bruised jaw gingerly . " How do you know ? " Mona did n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted to know , being thoroughly besotted with her . Poor Mona . She should be the only one benefiting from Father 's passing , but Ridley kept her like a prisoner . " Just think , " Mona said softly . " You will be the reason Lord Annan is reunited with his brother . An auspicious beginning , to be sure . ' Twill not be so bad . You 'll see . A better lot than mine . " Mona looked over her shoulder at Fayth , who had wandered back over to the fireplace . " And a much better match than the one Ridley has in mind for your sister . " Caroline sighed . Perhaps Mona was right . Surely ending the feud was a good thing . Lord Annan sounded like a reasonable man . She was allowed to keep Father Jasper . And Ridley was right  --  she was no prize . Four-and-twenty this past winter , she was no longer young . Nor was she beautiful . Lord Annan would seek his pleasure elsewhere . She could continue as always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed hips well suited for bearing many large children and that death in childbirth would not be such a danger to her as it was to most women . Mona returned to plaiting Caroline 's hair . What if this marriage did not bring peace ? What if the fires of reform engulfed Scotland and her husband repudiated God ? How would she be better off than under Ridley 's rule ? An idea occurred to her . Upon seeing her , Lord Annan would be as disappointed about the marriage as she was . Perhaps , if he were truly a reasonable man , he would be willing to renegotiate the marriage contract . Perhaps ...
