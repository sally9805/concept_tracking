<p> When President Bush started gearing up to send troops to Iraq , veteran Bruce Fenton broke away from his Republican roots - and stopped checking his political views at the office door . <p> As founder and president of Atlantic Financial in Westborough , Mass. , Mr. Fenton had long avoided talking politics at work , but he feels liberated now that he 's been speaking his mind . " Whatever side you are on , this is an important election ... and if people really care and they 're keeping their thoughts bottled up inside , that 's not conducive towards health and happiness , " he says . <p> Whether he 's offering up a sophisticated argument or occasionally blurting out his view that " George Bush is a raving lunatic , " Fenton has discovered that " no one bites your head off . " He encourages employees - including his " die-hard Republican friends " - to take a stand for their opinions , too , and says they all respect each other more for the debate . The lunch room is frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fahrenheit 9/11 " and the security measures leading up to this week 's Democratic National Convention . <p> But as elections approach and memories of hanging chads resurface , not every workplace is so harmonious . As a result , managers are sharpening their strategies for defusing tense conversations or offensive jokes . Political discussion should n't be prohibited in the workplace , experts say , but employers are wise to assert some control over when and how it happens . <p> " Come November , this race is going to be over , but the company 's going to go on ... and things that are said and done in the heat of the moment at a conference table ... may have far-reaching impact , " says Earl Taylor , national spokesman for Dale Carnegie Training . <p> At a recent meeting Mr. Taylor attended in Raleigh , N.C. , conversation during a break turned to the fact that John Kerry would be visiting the state to make appearances with his running mate , North Carolina Sen. John Edwards . " As the topic took on a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' You know , I really appreciate the fact that everybody has such an active interest in the politics of our nation , and there 's a time and a place for it . Today , we 're here to focus on ... ' and he talked about the business issues . " Not everyone at the meeting was a fan of the two Johns , Taylor says , and the manager " had the balance to bring it to a halt before temperatures started to rise . " <p> Managers watch their language <p> Even if tempers are n't flaring , political conversations or e-mails " can move into other topics that ... could arguably create a hostile work environment , " says Stephen Paskoff , president of ELI ( Employment Learning Innovations ) in Atlanta . One client from Boston recently asked how to handle discussions about gay marriage . It 's not always easy to draw the line between talking politics and denigrating categories of people , Mr. Paskoff says , but employers should not tolerate " divisive , negative , stereotypical , or offensive comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross ethical lines , says Bruce Weinstein , president of Ethics at Work , a consulting firm in New York . " Fahrenheit 9/11 " and " The Passion of the Christ " have brought out strong reactions during water-cooler chats , he says . His advice : Think more about what kind of language you use , and keep in mind the Golden Rule . " Your first responsibility at work is to do the job , and disrespectful conversations about these topics ... violate the employer 's right to have the employees focus on their work . " <p> In one small department of a pharmaceutical company in North Carolina 's Research Triangle , antiwar talk turned into a lesson about diversity . Leigh Morgan , a global project leader , says that she and her colleagues frequently vented their disagreement with President Bush 's foreign policy when they gathered in the common area of the suite - until the administrative assistant interrupted them one day to point out that the conversations did n't sit well with her . She had formerly served in the Air Force and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I was really glad that she shared that with us , " Ms. Morgan says , " and we had some conversations about how those of us who were in the majority in terms of opinion needed to make some efforts to not talk in public spaces , so that she would n't feel as uncomfortable . " <p> Some companies actively build grass-roots political enthusiasm among employees and retirees - usually with the goal of persuading them to lobby for legislation important to the company 's bottom line . A growing number are sponsoring candidate forums ( to which all sides are invited ) or voter registration drives , says Amy Showalter , a consultant in Cincinnati who helps employers set up such programs . She always urges companies to present both sides of the issue without bias , because " employees know when they 're being manipulated . " <p> Corporate officials often assure employees that their political views wo n't help or hurt their careers - and that 's especially important when the invitation goes out for donations to a corporate Political Action Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's issues . But employees still sometimes feel pressured to give . A recent survey by CFO magazine found that among those at the vice president level or higher , 24 percent said that not giving to their corporate PAC could harm their careers . <p> Most workers stay mum <p> At the same time , most employees simply do n't want to be distracted by the ideological equivalent of a rubberband war . In a Monster.com survey last year , 30 percent of the 26,000 respondents said the best approach to politics at work is " do n't ask , do n't tell . " Another 46 percent preferred to listen but keep their opinions to themselves . Just 22 percent said people should " stand up and be heard . " <p> For workers drawn into uncomfortable conversations , experts offer a few suggestions : Ask questions rather than answer them if you 're not sure how your views will be received . If you feel pressured , find a way to change the subject or excuse yourself from the room . " Try to keep it focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes totally opinionated and ... lacks the specificity needed for a meaningful conversation , " says Taylor of Dale Carnegie Training . <p> ForNghi Luu , a consultant who spends months at a time at client sites , politics are a welcome relief from another strain of conversation he hears all too often : complaints about work . He often throws out a political topic during lunch , even though he knows it 's risky . " People start sharing their opinions ... and this usually goes well until someone is very vocal and has too strong of an opinion , " he writes in an e-mail . " Then it takes its toll on the group ... and things get a little quiet and a new topic is introduced ... to lighten the mood . " <p> Giving her ' two cents ' <p> At Atlantic Financial , workers tack up news articles that support their side of the latest argument . Overall , there 's a good mix of substance and humor , Fenton says . " I was a huge Dean supporter and I took my share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease ... You have to laugh at that . But there are also very serious matters that the candidates have brought up , " he adds . <p> He believes his efforts to set a respectful tone have succeeded , because people who used to keep quiet now feel free to jump in . Take Cali Teceno , a client-service representative at the company and , at 22 , the youngest of the dozen staff members : " Originally I never used to watch the news , I never kept up with any type of politics whatsoever , " she says . " I still would n't say I 'm either Republican or Democrat , but I 'm definitely more informed about what 's going on in terms of the world ... After about a year and a half , I spoke up and gave my two cents here and there . " <p> Because some of her colleagues have military backgrounds , she finds the discussions about war fascinating . The conversation gets tense every once in a while , she says , but " it 's pretty open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run and hide underneath the table . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
