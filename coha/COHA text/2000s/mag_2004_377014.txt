By age 38 , Vivek Paul had already seen his American Dream come true . He arrived in the U.S. from India as an M.B.A . student in 1980 , worked hard , married , started a family and rose to a top job at GE , having been recruited by Jack Welch himself . Then , in 1999 , Azim Premji , chairman of Wipro , an Indian conglomerate , called him back to India . He asked Paul , a former water-polo captain , to take over his software unit , Wipro Technologies . " He said , ' You can build another skyscraper in New York , ' " Paul says , " ' or you can build a completely new thing in India . ' " Paul took the challenge . He transformed Wipro Technologies from a $150 million software developer into a $1 billion force in offshore outsourcing , handling IT and customer service for companies ranging from Delta Air Lines to Best Buy . But in order for Wipro to join the ranks of giants like IBM , Paul says he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as great individual contributors , not great managers , " he says . To turn his army of techies into sophisticated global consultants , he is investing in training in such " soft skills " as talking to clients . With his home in the U.S. and his work in India , Paul has a dual take on the furor over outsourcing . He champions India 's software industry but also supports a better safety net for displaced workers in the U.S. " My kids are growing up here , " he says . " It 's as important for me to do well in my business as it is to make sure that they grow up with a healthy economic outlook . " His American Dream , it turns out , is n't quite complete .  --  By Jyoti Thottam/New York
