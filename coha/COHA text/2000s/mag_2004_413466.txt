// It 's been a whole year since my sister 's prom night . But people in this town are still talking about it . If you ask me , everyone made too much of a fuss about what Sandy did . I 'll never forget opening the paper at breakfast the next morning . There it was , right under the photos of the President and the new hippopotamus born at the zoo . I could n't believe my eyes . " Sandy ! " I nearly choked on my cereal . My sister jumped back , startled . " Hey ! " she cried . " You spit milk all over my chemistry homework ! " " Your picture 's in the paper ! " " What ? " she grabbed the paper away from me and stared at the photo of her and her prom date . They were all dressed up and smiling like idiots in a toothpaste commercial . " Pretty embarrassing , huh ? " I said , sympathetically , as I looked over her shoulder . " No , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what I did . " If I remember right , the whole thing started three weeks before the prom . At four in the afternoon , the phone rang . " That must be Greg , " my sister gasped , fluffing her hair as if Greg could see her over the phone . " You pick it up , " she ordered . I shrugged and waited till the sixth ring , just to drive her nuts . " PICK IT UP ! " she said again . " Oh , certainly , Your Highness ! " I bowed , and answered the phone . " Hello ? " Sandy whispered to me in a panic : " Tell Greg I 'm ... in the garage . I do n't want him to think I 've been waiting for him to call . " I nodded sourly , and signaled her to shut up . " What ? " I said into the phone . " I could n't hear you . There 's a ... dog biting my leg .... Oh ... well , it 'll take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy nodded her approval . " Yeah . . . she 's in the garage . . . repairing our Rolls Royce . " Sandy kicked I me . I laughed and handed her the phone . " It 's Kyle , " I said . " Kyle ? " She looked like she 'd just won six million dollars in the lottery . Sandy fluffed up her hair again as she talked . She waved her arms wildly at me like she was flagging down airplanes . She wanted me to leave the room . OK by me . I did n't care about her stupid phony phone calls , anyway . At dinner that night , my mom started fishing for information . " Sandy , was n't that a boy who called you this afternoon ? " " Yes , Mother , " she said , annoyed . " Do you want to know what we talked about ? " " Of course not , dear , " Mom said , not too convincingly . " That 's your private affair . " " I am not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to ask me to the prom . " " I thought you 'd promised to go with Greg , " Grandpa said , winking . " I did n't promise , Grandpa , " Sandy replied . " Besides , I saw him talking to Marian last week . " " Talking to her ? " Grandpa said , pretending to be shocked . " The scoundrel ! Pass me the sour grapes . " Sandy started to whine . To Sandy , whining is an art . " Now I do n't know what to do ! " she wailed . " If I go with KyIe , Greg will be hurt . If I go with Greg , then Kyle will never , never ask me out again ! Maybe I should skip the prom altogether , " she said dramatically . " Like we care , " I said , fooling with my mashed potatoes . Mom patted Sandy on the head and made soothing baby noises . " Whatever you want , dear , " Mom said . " It 's settled , then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go ! Besides , proms are for geeks , anyway . " For once , Sandy and I were in agreement . " If you do n't go , you 'll regret it , " Grandpa said , talking like Humphrey Bogart . " Maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow . But soon , and for the rest of your life . " He whispered in my ear . " That 's from Casablanca . Here 's looking at you , kid ! " " You did n't even go to your own prom , Dad , " my mom said to him . Grandpa took off his eyeglasses and rubbed the lenses on his shirt . He sighed and looked down at his veiny hands . When he spoke , his voice was his own . But quieter . " It was 1941 , " he said , " right before the U.S. joined the war . We all knew it was coming . Only a matter of time . " Laura , " he said , almost to himself . " Laura with the china doll 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day of school that year . Did n't want to risk someone else beating me to it . For months , I pictured in my mind how it would be with Laura . I dreamed of it , even wide awake . Laura said she dreamed of it , too . We 'd dance , slow . That 's how my dream went . I 'd hold her in my arms . I could almost feel it-the silk of her dress against my arm . Her perfume-jasmine , as she moved . Sandalwood , when she stood still . The sapphire necklace she always wore-blue fires , like her eyes . No , not as bright ! Not as bright . ... " His voice trailed off . Then he began again . " And then the war came . ... The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December . I was drafted six weeks later . The army did n't even give me leave to go home and say goodbye . I 'd always wanted to go to Hawaii , " Grandpa said with a strange smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub . " When we shipped out from San Francisco , Laura came to the dock to wave goodbye . At least , that 's what the guys told me . I never did find her in the crowd . " There was no prom for anyone , that year , " he said . " I guess we all grew up too fast . " Grandpa sighed and rubbed his eyes . " Too much hot pepper in this sauce , " he said , hoarsely . We 'd all stopped eating , and you could have heard a pin drop . " Did you see Laura when you came home ? " I asked , breaking the silence . There was a long pause , and I thought Grandpa was n't going to answer . But finally he said : " She 'd written me a letter . Just one , while I was overseas . Laura had married someone else . " // My sister Sandy did go to her prom that year . But she did n't go with Greg . And she did n't go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could see that , even from the newspaper photo . Maybe proms are n't so goofy , after all . <p>
