Among the many bonuses of advancing age , which include backache and balding , there is no greater horror than talking politics with your children and having them react as if you 're Dan Quayle . It happens suddenly too . One day you 're a cool populist hero who takes them to ball games and out for cheeseburgers , and the next day they 're quoting Noam Chomsky and giving hourly updates on dwindling rain forests . <P> Jeff and Andrew Lopez , 22 and 20 , and countless other young folk believe Ralph Nader would be king of the world if not for corporate-media perpetuation of nihilistic consumerism and a corrupt two-party political system . This hurts for many reasons , one being that they may be right . But the old man is n't as detached as the Trotsky twins think . Herewith , from the front lines outside the Democratic powwow in Los Angeles , a postcard from the revolution : <P> As the press has shown , any dope of a reporter can find three nose-ringed nitwits who do n't know night from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is an insult to 20-and-up rebels like those from the San Francisco-based Global Exchange , which educates and agitates on trade policy , environmental protection and campaign finance . <P> One day at a downtown rally , while Sandra Alvarez , 25 , and her comrades ticked off a smorgasbord of corporate malfeasance , Jason Mark , 25 , and three others left discreetly in two sedans , destination Hollywood . " There 's going to be a party tonight for Terry McAuliffe , chief pimp of the Democratic Party fund-raising machine , " says Mark , half threadbare chic and half Rat Pack cool . " It 's hosted by Patton Boggs , this big law firm , so these are Public Enemies No. 1 and 2 . Check out their website . " ( To wit : " Patton Boggs was among the first national law firms to recognize that all three branches of government could serve as forums in which to achieve client goals . " ) <P> " Corporations should n't run the government , " Mark says with a lighted butt , stabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you gain by crashing the party ? " In the short term , nothing . But you have to be in their face at every turn until you can build enough critical mass to shame them into reform . " <P> Car No. 1 has arrived at the gated Sunset Room , a swank club . The three spooks claim they 're checking on event lighting , and it works . They case the joint , come back outside and sketch a map of the inside . <P> Seven hours later , 25 demonstrators flash signs that include MCAULIFFE  --  CORPORATE PIMP . They 're chanting " Shame on you " as the high rollers limo in . It 's enough of a commotion that no one sees three nattily attired youngsters approach the door . That would be Mark and comrades Juliette Beck , 29 , and Alli Starr , 32 . With them is another youngster , Doris ( Granny D ) Haddock , 90 , who walked clear across the country last year in the name of campaign reform . All four get flagged , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashes his press pass ; Starr hooks my arm as if she 's my date , and we 've all passed over to the other side .
