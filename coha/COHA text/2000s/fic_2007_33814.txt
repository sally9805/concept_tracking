Chapter One The call came at midnight . Harry Bosch was awake and sitting in the living room in the dark . He liked to think that he was doing this because it allowed him to hear the saxophone better . By masking one of the senses he accentuated another . But deep down he knew the truth . He was waiting . The call was from Larry Gandle , his supervisor in Homicide Special . It was Bosch 's first call out in the new job . And it was what he had been waiting for . " Harry , you up ? " " I 'm up . " " Who 's that you got playing ? " " Frank Morgan , live at the Jazz Standard in New York . That 's George Cables you 're hearing now on piano . " " Sounds like ' All Blues . ' " " You nailed it . " " Good stuff . I hate to take you away from it . " Bosch used the remote to turn the music off . " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iggy to come out and take over a case . They 've already caught three today and ca n't handle a fourth . This one also looks like it might become a hobby . It looks like an execution . " The Los Angeles Police Department had seventeen geographic divisions , each with its own station and detective bureau , including a homicide squad . But the divisional squads were the first line and could n't get bogged down on long-running cases . When a murder came with any sort of political , celebrity or media attachment , it was usually shuttled down to Homicide Special , which operated out of the Robbery-Homicide Division in Parker Center . Any case that appeared to be particularly difficult and time-consuming - that would invariably stay active like a hobby - would also be an immediate candidate for Homicide Special . This was one of those . " Where is it ? " Bosch asked . " Up on that overlook above the Mulholland Dam . You know the place ? " " Yeah , I 've been up there . " Bosch got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a drawer designed for silverware and took out a pen and a small notebook . On the first page of the notebook he wrote down the date and the location of the murder scene . " Any other details I should know ? " Bosch asked . " Not a lot , " Gandle said . " Like I said , it was described to me as an execution . Two in the back of the head . Somebody took this guy up there and blew his brains out all over that pretty view . " Bosch let this register a moment before asking the next question . " Do they know who the dead guy is ? " " The divisionals are working on it . Maybe they 'll have something by the time you get over there . It 's practically in your neighborhood , right ? " " Not too far . " Gandle gave Bosch more specifics on the location of the crime scene and asked if Harry would make the next call out to his partner . Bosch said he would take care of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what 's what , then call me and let me know . Just wake me up . Everybody else does . " Bosch thought it was just like a supervisor to complain about getting woken up to a person he would routinely wake up over the course of their relationship . " You got it , " Bosch said . Bosch hung up and immediately called Ignacio Ferras , his new partner . They were still feeling their way . Ferras was more than twenty years younger and from another culture . The bonding would happen , Bosch was sure , but it would come slowly . It always did . Ferras was awakened by Bosch 's call but became alert quickly and seemed eager to respond , which was good . The only problem was that he lived all the way out in Diamond Bar , which would put his ETA at the crime scene at least an hour off . Bosch had talked to him about it the first day they had been assigned as partners but Ferras was n't interested in moving . He had a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bosch knew that he would get to the crime scene well ahead of Ferras and that would mean he would have to handle any divisional friction on his own . Taking a case away from the divisional squad was always a delicate thing . It was a decision usually made by supervisors , not by the homicide detectives on the scene . No homicide detective worth the gold trim on his badge would ever want to give away a case . That just was n't part of the mission . " See you there , Ignacio , " Bosch said . " Harry , " Ferras said , " I told you . Call me Iggy . Everybody does . " Bosch said nothing . He did n't want to call him Iggy . He did n't think it was a name that matched the weight of the assignment and mission . He wished that his partner would come to that realization and then stop asking him . Bosch thought of something and added an instruction , telling Ferras to swing by Parker Center on his way in and pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add minutes to his arrival time but Bosch planned to drive his own car to the scene and he knew he was low on gas . " Okay , see you there , " Bosch said , leaving names out . He hung up and grabbed his coat out of the closet by the front door . As he put his arms into it he glanced at himself in the mirror on the inside of the door . At fifty-six years old he was trim and fit and could even stand to add a few pounds , while other detectives his age were getting round in the middle . In Homicide Special , there was a pair of detectives known as Crate and Barrel because of their widening dimensions . Bosch did n't have to worry about that . The gray had not yet chased all of the brown out of his hair but it was getting close to victory . His dark eyes were clear and bright and ready for the challenge awaiting him at the overlook . In his own eyes Bosch saw a basic understanding of homicide work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be willing and able to go the distance - whatever that entailed - to get the job done . It made him feel as though he were bulletproof . He reached across his body with his left hand to pull the gun out of the holster on his right hip . It was a Kimber Ultra Carry . He quickly checked the magazine and the action and then returned the weapon to its holster . He was ready . He opened the door . The lieutenant had not known a lot about the case but he had been right about one thing . The crime scene was not far from Bosch 's home . He dropped down to Cahuenga and then took Barham across the 101 Freeway . From there it was a quick run up Lake Hollywood Drive to a neighborhood of homes clustered on the hills surrounding the reservoir and the Mulholland Dam . They were expensive homes . He worked his way around the fenced reservoir , stopping only for a moment when he came upon a coyote in the road . The animal 's eyes caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauntered slowly across the road , disappearing into the brush . It was in no hurry to get out of the way , almost daring Bosch to do something . It reminded him of his days on patrol , when he saw the same challenge in the eyes of most of the young men he encountered on the street . After passing the reservoir he took Tahoe Drive farther up into the hills and then connected with the eastern terminus of Mulholland Drive . There was an unofficial overlook of the city here . It was posted with NO PARKING and OVERLOOK CLOSED AT DARK signs . But these were routinely ignored at all hours of the day and night . Bosch pulled in behind the grouping of official vehicles - the Forensics van and the coroner 's wagon as well as several marked and unmarked police cars . There was an outer perimeter of yellow police tape surrounding the crime scene and inside this boundary was a silver Porsche Carrera with its hood open . It had been sectioned off by more yellow tape and this told Bosch that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got out . A patrol officer assigned to the outer perimeter took down his name and badge number - 2997 - and allowed him under the yellow tape . He approached the crime scene . Two banks of portable lights had been erected on either side of the body , which was in the center of a clearing that looked down upon the city . As Bosch approached he saw forensics techs and coroner 's people working on and around the body . A tech with a video camera was documenting the scene as well . " Harry , over here . " Bosch turned and saw Detective Jerry Edgar leaning against the hood of an unmarked detective cruiser . He had a cup of coffee in his hand and appeared to be just waiting . He pushed himself off the car as Bosch came over . Edgar had been Bosch 's partner once , back when he had worked in Hollywood Division . Back then Bosch was a team leader on the homicide squad . Now Edgar was in that position . " Been waiting on somebody from RHD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be you , man . " " It 's me . " " You working this solo ? " " No , my partner 's on the way . " " Your new partner , right ? I have n't heard from you since that mess over in Echo Park last year . " " Yeah . So what do you have here ? " Bosch did n't want to talk about Echo Park with Edgar . With anyone , as a matter of fact . He wanted to stay focused on the case at hand . It was his first call out since his transfer to Homicide Special . He knew there would be a lot of people watching his moves . Some of them would be people hoping he would fail . Edgar turned so that Bosch could see what was spread out on the trunk of the car . Bosch took out glasses and put them on as he leaned in close to look . There was n't a lot of light but he could see an array of evidence bags . The bags separately contained items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key ring and a clip-on name tag . There was also a money clip with a thick fold of currency and a BlackBerry that was still on , its green light flashing and ready to transmit calls its owner would never make or receive . " The coroner 's guy just gave me all of this , " Edgar said . " They should be done with the body in about ten minutes . " Bosch picked up the bag containing the ID tag and angled it toward the light . It said Saint Agatha 's Clinic for Women . On it was a photograph of a man with dark hair and dark eyes . It identified him as Dr. Stanley Kent . He was smiling at the camera . Bosch noticed that the ID tag was also a swipe key that could open locked doors . " You talk to Kiz much ? " Edgar asked . It was a reference to Bosch 's former partner , who had transferred after Echo Park to a management job in the OCP - the office of the chief of police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bosch moved on to the other evidence bags and wanted to move the conversation away from Kiz Rider and onto the case at hand . " Why do n't you run down what you 've got for me , Jerry ? " he said . " Happy to , " Edgar said . " The stiff was found about an hour ago . As you can see from the signs out on the street , there is no parking up here and no loitering after dark . Hollywood always has a patrol swing by here a few times a night to chase lookyloos away . Keeps the rich locals up here happy . I am told that house over there is Madonna 's . Or it was . " He pointed to a sprawling mansion about a hundred yards from the clearing . The moonlight silhouetted a tower rising from the structure . The mansion 's exterior was striped in alternating hues of rust and yellow like a Tuscan church . It was on a promontory that afforded anyone looking through its windows a magnificent , sweeping view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tower looking down on the city that lay at her command . Bosch looked back at his old partner , ready for the rest of the report . " The patrol car swings around about eleven and sees the Porsche with the hood open . Engine 's in the back of those Porsches , Harry . It means the trunk was open . " " Got it . " " Okay , so you knew that already . Anyway , the patrol car pulls up , they do n't see anybody in or around the Porsche , so the two officers get out . One of them walks out into the clearing and finds our guy . He 's facedown and has two in the back of the head . An execution , clean and simple . " Bosch nodded at the ID tag in the evidence bag . " And this is the guy , Stanley Kent ? " " Looks that way . The tag and the wallet both say he 's Stanley Kent , forty-two years old from just around the corner on Arrowhead Drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to a business called K and K Medical Physicists . I just ran Kent through the box and he came up pretty clean . He 's got a few speeding tickets on the Porsche but that 's it . A straight shooter . " Bosch nodded as he registered all the information . " You are going to get no grief from me , taking over this case , Harry , " Edgar said . " I got one partner in court this month and I left my other one at the first scene we caught today - a three-bagger with a fourth victim on life support at Queen of Angels . " Bosch remembered that Hollywood ran its homicide squad in three-man teams instead of the traditional partnerships . " Any chance the three-bagger is connected to this ? " He pointed to the gathering of technicians around the body on the overlook . " No , that 's a straight gang shoot-'em-up , " Edgar said . " I think this thing is a whole different ball game and I 'm happy for you to take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll cut you loose as soon as I can . Anybody look in the car yet ? " " Not really . Waiting on you . " " Okay . Anybody go to the victim 's house on Arrowhead ? " " No on that , too . " " Anybody knock on any doors ? " " Not yet . We were working the scene first . " Edgar obviously had decided early that the case would be passed to RHD . It bothered Bosch that nothing had been done but at the same time , he knew it would be his and Ferras 's to work fresh from the start , and that was n't a bad thing . There was a long history in the department of cases getting damaged or bungled while in transition from divisional to downtown detective teams . He looked at the lighted clearing and counted a total of five men working on or near the body for the forensics and coroner 's teams . " Well , " he said , " since you 're working the crime scene first , did anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the techs approach ? " Bosch could n't keep the tone of annoyance out of his voice . " Harry , " Edgar said , his tone now showing annoyance with Bosch 's annoyance , " a couple hundred people stand around on this overlook every damn day . We coulda been looking at footprints till Christmas if we 'd wanted to take the time . I did n't think we did . We had a body lying out here in a public place and needed to get to it . Besides that , it looks like a professional hit . That means the shoes , the gun , the car , everything 's already long gone by now . " Bosch nodded . He wanted to dismiss this and move on . " Okay , " he said evenly , " then I guess you 're clear . " Edgar nodded and Bosch thought he might be embarrassed . " Like I said , Harry , I did n't expect it to be you . " Meaning he would not have dogged it for Harry , only for somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understand . " After Edgar left , Bosch went back to his car and got the Maglite out of the trunk . He walked back to the Porsche , put on gloves and opened the driver-side door . He leaned into the car and looked around . On the passenger seat was a briefcase . It was unlocked and when he popped the snaps it opened to reveal several files , a calculator and various pads , pens and papers . He closed it and left it in its place . Its position on the seat told him that the victim had likely arrived at the overlook by himself . He had met his killer here . He had not brought his killer with him . This , Bosch thought , might be significant . He opened the glove box next and several more clip-on IDs like the one found on the body fell to the floorboard . He picked them up one by one and saw that each access badge had been issued by a different local hospital . But the swipe cards all bore the same name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumed ) who was lying dead in the clearing . He noticed that on the back of several of the tags there were handwritten notations . He looked at these for a long moment . Most were numbers with the letters L or R at the end and he concluded that they were lock combinations . Bosch looked farther into the glove box and found even more IDs and access key cards . As far as he could tell , the dead man - if he was Stanley Kent - had clearance access to just about every hospital in Los Angeles County . He also had the combinations to security locks at almost every one of the hospitals . Bosch briefly considered that the IDs and key cards might be counterfeits used by the victim in some sort of hospital scam . Bosch returned everything to the glove box and closed it . He then looked under and between the seats and found nothing of interest . He backed out of the car and went to the open trunk . The trunk was small and empty . But in the beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the carpet lining the bottom . It was clear that something square and heavy with four legs or wheels had been carried in the trunk . Because the trunk was found in the open position it was likely that the object - whatever it was - had been taken during the killing . " Detective ? " (
