Chapter One Tampa The consistently inventive positions of the hurricane-flung bodies validated the chaos theory , particularly those equations involving trajectory , procrastination and trailer parks . Certain corpses seemed purposefully arranged , the rest very much not . Some appeared to have been scattered by mortar strikes , others peacefully reclined like stuffed pandas on a child 's bed , still others looked like sick practical jokes being played on the recovery crews . The disturbing circumstance of one particular body , the next to be discovered , was no accident . But wait , we 're getting ahead of ourselves . Let 's back up . . . . June 1 . The opening day of the Atlantic hurricane season was like any other : dire predictions in the media and cheerful sales at the home-improvement centers . How people ramped up for hurricanes depended on experience . If you 'd been through a direct hit , you did n't fool around . Plywood , gas , go . Those with small children were the first to bolt , followed by seasonal residents , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Most had developed keen instincts and knew precisely when to pull the trigger ; the crustier stayed put no matter what and were interviewed on CNN . Newer residents forgot to charge up cell phones ; the wealthy scheduled unscheduled vacations ; families gathered family albums ; insurance executives canceledcoverage . Prescriptions and sandbags were filled . Some believed in the power of hoarding canned meat ; others lost faith in electricity and withdrew massive amounts of cash from ATMs . Door-to-door entrepreneurs purchased chain saws for the brisk post-strike downed-tree business . There were the tourists , who stared bitterly at unused portions of multi-park passes ; sailboat owners , who spiderwebbed vessels to docks ; the motor-oil-baseball-cap people standing in the beds of pickup trucks , making everyone wonder by loading the heaviest , most worthless shit ; and college students , whose hurricane preparation consisted of not knowing a storm was coming . The memories of 2004 were supposed to greatly improve public awareness . Charley , Frances , Ivan , Jeanne . Since then , authorities found less trouble getting residents to heed evacuation orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had deep roots in nearly four decades of borrowed luck . There was one ten-year period from 1975 to 1985 when but a single hurricane made landfall in Florida . The next seven years saw only three more . Meanwhile , thousands of new communities and condos sprouted along coastlines with the growth-speed and sturdiness of spring-shower mushrooms . Then 2004 . As many hurricanes that had struck during seventeen years pummeled the state in less than six weeks . A lot of residents learned their lesson and installed the latest storm shutters . Others drank beer . Then 2005 . Dennis , Katrina , Rita , Wilma . Another wake-up call . Someone hit the snooze alarm . Hurricane shutters were already up on an old theater in Seminole Heights . It was now a low-rent professional building . A clock ticked on the wall of an upstairs office , postmodern feng shui . Two people sat in white leather chairs , facing each other twenty feet apart . Only one could see the clock . That was by design . A self-assured woman with pulled-back strawberry hair folded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with genuineness . " What are you thinking about ? " " It 's dark in here . " " The shutters are up , " said the psychiatrist . " I know , " said Serge . " A big one 's already on the way , and it 's only the beginning of June . It 's all I 've been able to think about . " " The anxiety 's perfectly normal . Especially after the last few years . I 've been seeing a lot more patients --  " " Oh , I 'm not worried , " said Serge . " I 'm cookin ' ! I love hurricane season ! " Her expression changed . " Why ? " " Potato chips . " The doctor took a deep , poised breath and looked down at her notebook . " I did n't think I 'd ever see you again . " Serge slouched in his chair . " I was in the neighborhood . " " I just moved to this office . That means you had to look me up . " " Happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself more credit . The last time we saw each other , you were involuntarily committed . This time you came on your own . You 're taking steps . " " See ? And you wonder why I 've been away so long . You still think I 'm crazy . " " That 's an unfortunate term we do n't like to use . " " I like to use it , " said Serge . " You want to talk about crazy ? I knew this caseworker who was checking on a guy in a St. Pete transient hotel . One of those beautiful old places with the striped awnings over the sidewalk . But that 's another tragedy , another day . My friend knocks on the door and does n't get an answer , so he tries the knob . Unlocked . He goes in , and there 's shit everywhere . I do n't mean trash or PlayStations . I mean real shit . The smell hit him like a shovel . The guy he 's looking for is sitting in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moose antlers , singing Peter Gabriel -- Shed my skin !  - -  playing with more turds , sculpting little bunny rabbits . He 's got a whole bunch of them lined up on the floor in an infantry formation like some kind of Easter-morning nightmare . My friend says , ' Tito , you have n't been taking your medication , have you ? ' Then he gets hit in the chest with a shit-bunny . But he tells me he likes his job because it 's something brand new every day . In my thinking , there 's good brand new and bad . Know what I mean ? " " And this story is important to you how ? " " That 's crazy . I just want someone to talk to . " " Then let 's talk . How have you been ? Do you recognize the improvement ? " " Not really . " " I can , " said the doctor . " When we first met , you were wearing a straitjacket . " " Since then I 've learned to dress for success . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Serge squirmed into a different slouch . " Those pills made my head thick . I was turning into my friend Coleman . You know how you are the first few seconds after waking up in the morning ? He 's stretching it into a life .
