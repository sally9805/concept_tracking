Chapter Four : Get to Work The first thing that Ernie wrote down in his game plan was the word employees . He scrawled it in his notebook under the heading Things to Do and he marked it with a star . If Ernie was going to make this project happen , he needed help . The lot was a mess . He could n't do it all by himself . He needed employees for the dirty work . Ernie thought and thought  --  and really only one kid came to mind . Dusty . The strange kid from three doors down . After his mom died , Ernie had transferred from the Catholic school across town  --  which was his mom 's alma mater  --  back to the public school in his own neighborhood . " Got ta cut back somewhere , " his dad said , meaning the tuition . Ernie did n't mind , except he did n't actually know the kids in his own neighborhood , so all the kids at his new school were basically strangers . The next afternoon , Ernie tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wet cement in the sidewalk . Ernie ducked behind a tree to see what Dusty was up to . As Ernie watched , Dusty reached into a large cardboard box beside him and raised an old china plate into the air . Ernie could never have predicted what happened next . Dusty smashed the plate against the curb so hard that it shattered into pieces . Then he calmly sifted through the shards until he had selected one particular chip . Dusty studied the piece closely , rolling it back and forth between his fingers . After some careful thought , he tossed it aside . When Dusty finally found a shard that was satisfactory , he leaned over the wet cement and carefully pressed the chip into position . For several minutes , heworked in this slow and careful manner . " This could take forever , " Ernie said to himself . When Dusty was finally done , he sat back to admire his creation . Of course , Ernie had edged closer behind a hedge so that he could see what Dusty was doing . Poking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wet cement depicting an intergalactic space battle in wild cartoon colors . Ernie was impressed . Very impressed . Unfortunately , a moment later , a boot smashed down right into the middle of the wet cement ; a boot belonging to Dion , the neighborhood bully . Dion was a nightmare and a constant threat . Everyone kept wishing he would either grow up or move away . Until that happened , there was n't much that anyone could do about Dion . As Dion trampled the wet cement , Dusty flailed helplessly to protect his mosaic . " Quit ! Stop it ! " " Biff ! Poweee ! Socko ! Ooooff ! " Dion barked as he stomped . Ernie ducked inside the hedge . It felt a little cowardly , but Ernie was one to pick his battles wisely . " Stop ! You ruined it ! " Dusty cried , pretty much stating the obvious . It was kind of pathetic . " What are you gon na do , Freakazoid ? " Dion snarled . When the deed was done , Dion charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolished . Dusty sat back on his heels , splattered with cement , too wounded to speak , too hurt to cry . At that moment , a shadow arched over the ruined mosaic . Dusty winced into the sunlight to see who it was . No surprise here . It was Ernie . Ernie squatted beside the wet cement and said , " Sweet while it lasted , huh , kid ? " He ran his hand over the remnants and continued , " Clever , inventive . Got a sense of humor . And the old plates keep your costs down . " Ernie brushed his hands off and held one out for a handshake . " Good work , kid , " he said . " I been looking for a kid like you . Name 's Ernie . " " Dusty , " said Dusty , wiping off his palm and shaking Ernie 's hand . " Oh , I know your name , all right , " said Ernie . Dusty was bewildered . Nobody in the neighborhood had ever talked to him this way before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I need boxes , " Ernie announced with a sense of purpose . " Well , not just boxes . More like boxes for a funeral , say . " " For a funeral ? " Dusty asked , completely confused . " You mean , you need a coffin ? " " I prefer the word ... sarcophagus , " Ernie said with relish . " It 's Egyptian . But never mind about that . Got a minute ? I got a proposition for you . " And that was how Ernie and Dusty came to be friends . It was Dusty who tipped Ernie off to Tony . " Look for the kid with the shovel , " is what he said . " You ca n't miss him . " On Dusty 's recommendation , Ernie found himself leaning against a lemonade stand late in the afternoon . Looking across the street , Ernie saw a scrappy little boy , about seven or eight , and sure enough he was flinging a great big shovel , almost twice his size . That must be Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole and wiped his brow . With the job done , Tony squinted across the street at the lemonade stand and headed in that direction . He dragged the shovel on the pavement behind him and it made an awful sound . Ernie arranged himself at the counter so that he looked all nonchalant . Tony arrived and gestured at the Sweaty Lemonade Girl behind the counter . " Hit me with the usual , " he said . Sweaty Lemonade Girl snapped back , " Move along , Stinky . You scare away the customers . " She pinched her fingers over her nose and stuck out her tongue . Tony balked . " Hey , " he cried , all indignant and offended , and why should n't he be ? Ernie cleared his throat and rolled his eyes . Tony was stinky  --  but Sweaty Lemonade Girl was no prize either . Clearly , he thought , Sweaty Lemonade Girl has no idea how to run a business . Ernie tossed a few coins on the counter . " Put that one on me , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of lemonade for Tony . She put it on the counter and scooped up the change . " Thanks , mister , " the kid said , turning toward Ernie . " Name 's Tony . " " Ernie , here . Pretty good with a shovel , kid , " said Ernie . " I try , " said Tony with a shrug . Ernie leaned in confidentially and lowered his voice so that Sweaty Lemonade Girl could n't overhear . " I 'm looking for somebody to dig a few holes , " he said . " You interested ? " Tony looked both ways and back across the counter . Sweaty Lemonade Girl pursed her lips and arched her eyebrows as if she was suddenly all interested in Tony 's business . Tony turned his back to the counter and perched against his elbows . He tilted his head toward Ernie and answered , " Depends . " He knocked back his lemonade , crumpled the cup , and chucked it over the counter . " Hey ! " Sweaty Lemonade Girl grumbled with annoyance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony leaned in confidentially against Ernie and whispered , " What do I have to bury ? " Over the next week , Ernie had Tony and Dusty working like dogs on the empty lot . Tony hacked through the undergrowth with a huge pair of hedge clippers he had borrowed from his dad . Dusty spent the afternoon hauling all manner of debris to the curb . When the shrubs and trees were clipped back , Tony showed up with his dad 's Weedwacker and carefully cut the grass until it was as smooth as a golf course 's . Ernie tried to take a crack at the Weed-wacker himself , but Tony held him off . " Forget it , Mr. Castellano , " Tony said , " this is a job for a professional . " When the yard was finally cleaned up , they set about making improvements . And that was when Dusty went to town . Dusty 's first idea was to scavenge through the neighborhood for discarded plants and potted mums . He showed up with a red wagon full of wilted plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon and said , " Who died ? " " I do n't know about this , Dusty , " said Ernie . " Those flowers look kind of ragged and pathetic . " " Give ' em time , Boss , " Dusty insisted . " They 'll look better in time . " Dusty replanted the flowers around the base of the trees . After a little sunlight and a little water , Ernie had to agree with Dusty . The flowers did n't look bad at all . Pretty soon , they were all coming up with great ideas like that . Tony had found a slightly trashed trestle in the alley and dragged it into the lot . " I figure , fix the broken slats with a couple nails , slap on a fresh coat of paint , " Tony said , " it 'll be like brand new . " And it pretty much was . When the paint had dried , Dusty tugged overgrown vines from the fence and laced them through the trestle , hoping they would grow . As he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench he 'd found on the curb . He placed it below the trestle . " It 'll be a place for quiet reflection , " he said . " That 's just what I was thinking , " Dusty agreed . Ernie remembered an aluminum picnic table in the basement that they never used anymore . It had belonged to his mom before he was born . He and Tony carried the picnic table upstairs and hauled it down the alley . They positioned it on the back side of the lot and moved it five different times until Dusty decided that it was in the right spot . Meanwhile , Dusty was scouring the neighborhood for big , flat rocks . He covered the picnic table with newspaper and spent the afternoon painting the rocks all sorts of different colors . " It 's like painting Easter eggs , " he said , " only much much bigger . " When Dusty was done , they laid the painted rocks in a winding trail across the lawn . It was backbreaking work  --  but after he put the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor . Ernie smiled . " The place is looking good , " he told Tony . " I tell you , that Dusty , he 's got a million ideas . " For the crowning touch , Dusty climbed on Ernie 's shoulders to crawl into the tallest tree on the lot . Clinging to the overhead branches , Dusty hung that wind chime he 'd been working on . It was made out of those wire hangers , and he had added lots of discarded silverware , hammered flat . Every time a breeze brushed through the tree , the wind chime clanked and clattered and sent a strange little tune into the air . All in all , they had turned the old abandoned lot into a lovely little garden . Only nobody knew .
