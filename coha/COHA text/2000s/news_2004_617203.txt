<p> He cooked up some magic in a back alley in Hong Kong . <p> Now he 's ready to do the same in an abandoned bank in Buford . <p> Globe-hopping chef Chris Hope helped make the restaurant La Rose Noire ( the Black Rose ) into a culinary star of the Orient in the late 1980s and early 1990s . <p> But when Hope , his wife , Petra , and their two children immigrated to Atlanta four years ago to try to re-create the Rose , the project fell like a deflated souffle . He cooked at chain restaurants to keep the family afloat , leaving his personal pots and pans in storage . <p> However , Hope sees redemption coming with his new restaurant . <p> Within the next week or two , Hope and his partner Mick Luckhurst , the former Atlanta Falcons placekicker , will open an elegant new restaurant called Sperata ( from the Latin word for hope ) in Buford 's historic downtown . <p> " My pots and pans are finally getting the chance to come out and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And who 'd have guessed it would happen in downtown Buford ? " <p> Actually , Sperata 's opening will be an extension of the ongoing transformation of Buford 's Main Street into an arts-and-entertainment district . Over the past few years , art galleries , restaurants and nightclubs have sprung up in long-empty storefronts . <p> The renaissance is being fed by residents in affluent surrounding communities who have tired of making the trek to Buckhead for a night on the town . <p> Hope wants to use his artistry to feed those same folks and the epicures who venture out from the city . <p> " This is what I 've been aiming for , " he said , referring to his personal rendition of Mediterranean , Continental and fusion cuisine that will be the daily fare at Sperata . <p> Surprises will be served with practically every course . For example , one entree is fillets of beef stuffed with fois gras ( goose liver ) in a truffle reduction . A sample appetizer is a seafood cocktail in a champagne and caviar sauce . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hope said . <p> " A painter can work on inspiration , but a chef has to cook every day , " he said . " I get inspiration from getting the freshest products . I get extra energy from the fish or the produce , when it 's a beautiful , fresh thing . " <p> Artistry at work <p> Sperata is intended to be an artistic experience in its design as well as its food . The old wood floors have been polished and the walls given a textured , umber surface . A long bar was custom-designed to enable Hope and his assistants to cook in view of the customers . <p> Its birth process was n't nearly so flawless . To get from a gutted portion of a century-old bank building to a little slice of Tuscany , the restaurant 's creators had to fight plagues of rust , dust and sundry delays that set the project back about eight months . <p> Petra Hope saw Murphy 's Law applying itself to the major and minor parts of the project . <p> " Everything gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding as a corollary , " Nothing fits . " <p> It was she who found the space that would become Sperata . In the time after the demise of the Black Rose project in Atlanta , she and Chris decided to try to stay in the metro area . <p> His first impulse was to head back to Asia , where he had been successful before , but they had two children who had just been transplanted to a strange country and liked the place they had landed in , the Hamilton Mill community in the Dacula area . While Chris commuted to restaurants in Peachtree City and Norcross , Petra became an American soccer mom . <p> All the time , they were looking for a place to open their own restaurant , scouting mostly in the Buckhead area . But a Gwinnett real estate agent and neighbor told Petra , " We need a great restaurant out here . " <p> Petra started scouting downtown Buford , where the successful bistro Aqua Terra had already broken new ground for upscale dining in the district . She found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a chance meeting in a coffee shop with the father of Luckhurst 's development partner , John McPherson . <p> McPherson and Luckhurst essentially had started the Buford redevelopment boom about eight years ago . They converted a church into the headquarters of their company , American Hole In One Insurance . They later renovated a nearby building on the downtown square for expansion of their company , which now employs about 150 people nationally and internationally . <p> Luckhurst met Hope , the two Brits hit it off , and the concept for Sperata was born , with Luckhurst as the Hopes ' investment partner . Luckhurst readily acknowledges he is a novice . <p> " I know where I stand in the restaurant business  --  I do n't know anything , " he said . " But I love a challenge . " <p> After his playing days ended in the late 1980s , Luckhurst became a television personality , primarily as a commentator for pro football games televised by satellite to England . <p> With a growing family  --  Luckhurst and his wife , Ruth , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two older children from a previous marriage  --  Luckhurst gradually retreated from the sports world and travel to his insurance business . <p> However , he continued to cultivate his love for wine . His personal collection is about 3,000 bottles . So Luckhurst took the lead in assembling Sperata 's wine list . <p> He and his wine-loving friends gathered for dozens of tastings , where they rated the wines being offered for the new restaurant . The list will be heavy on California reds , Luckhurst 's favorites , and there will be selections for those diners who want to spend a lot of money for an exceptional wine . <p> That was the fun part . <p> The sloping floors , odd angles and generally musty conditions in the old building were not conducive to a smooth conversion project . Plus , the space was leased , not owned , adding further complications to even the simple jobs . <p> For example , late last year , workmen used an acid solution to clean floor tiles in the cooking area . <p> The tiles got cleaned , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment . The Hopes spent much of the holiday season scouring the stove and grills and metal vent panels . <p> Four different carpenters were called in to execute Luckhurst 's design for the oak bar that is a feature of the 60-seat dining room . But as late as last week , some of the shelves still did n't fit . <p> Recently , Luckhurst and Chris Hope have increasingly cast themselves in the roles of handymen , completing some of the final pre-opening tasks . <p> They assembled a curved section of pipe and hung a black shower curtain on it to block off the bright light coming into the dining area from the kitchen . <p> " Halle-bloody-lujah ! " shouted Luckhurst . The dream of Sperata was close to becoming a reality . <p> ' I 'm a lucky guy ' <p> Maintaining the desired ambience at Sperata will be the domain of maitre d ' Javier Alonso , a native of Spain . He has worked at hotels and restaurants in Madrid and Mexico City , as well as the Ritz Carlton-Buckhead and Chateau Elan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream to be the host of a superior restaurant he helped create , he said . <p> " This is like looking at a beautiful lady , and she looks back at me , " Alonso said . " I 'm saying , ' Who ? Me ? ' I 'm a lucky guy . " <p> Last week , Alonso started training the Sperata staff . The dress in the dining room will be white shirt and black tuxedo pants , with a black vest and tie for dinner . The standard for service will be to add to the customer 's experience of a memorable meal . Being late is severely frowned upon . <p> Some of the staff have come from fancy restaurants ; others have had experience in group renditions of the Happy Birthday song . Most of them are from the northern Gwinnett area . <p> " It 's culture , " said Whitni Owens of Buford , who will be one of the waitresses . " This gives us a chance to get to the classier side of the restaurant business . " <p> Owens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff at Sperata . <p> " Everybody really has to be into teamwork . Everybody has to move like one person out here , " she said . <p> Another waitress from Buford , Sarah Depew , said Sperata has helped make the new Main Street of Buford a far cry from the place where she grew up . <p> " When I was a kid , this was all run-down , " Depew said . " I remember when Main Street was nothing . There was one gas station with an Indian guy statue on top . " <p> Kitchens of the world <p> For Chris Hope , Sperata is a chance to reclaim a spot in the top tier of the culinary world . <p> He started cooking professionally in England , and by age 22 he was the sous chef , supervising a staff of 80 , at the renowned Berkeley Hotel in London . <p> He took a step down in rank for the chance to cook and learn at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hamburg , Germany , where he met Petra . <p> He accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong , and a few years later , he left for La Rose Noire . <p> At the time , it was an unassuming bistro owned by Michel Emeric . He and his wife were entertainers , primarily . He played piano ; she sang Edith Piaf songs . <p> " Chris turned the place around , " said Emeric , who currently operates a catering business in Atlanta . " It became one of the best restaurants in Hong Kong . " <p> In 1989 , the Gault Millau guide rated La Rose Noire as the best independent western restaurant in the city . <p> " He was doing things that other people were n't doing . He 's a great chef , " Emeric said . <p> The Hopes left Hong Kong in 1997 , deciding it was n't where they wanted to raise their children . They returned to England , where Chris became the chef at some small resort hotels . <p> But in 2000 , Emeric asked Chris to meet him in Paris . Emeric wanted to re-create La Rose Noire in Atlanta , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans did n't work out , both men decided to stay in the Atlanta area . <p> " You 've got to stop moving sometime , " Hope said . <p> To make Sperata happen , Chris and Petra Hope have invested a significant part of their savings and secured an operational loan . <p> " We have everything on the line , " Chris said . " The whole Hope empire is on the line . " <p> Yet , as he cooked his first test meal last week in the Sperata kitchen , Hope seemed anything but anxious . He shuffled saute pans that shot up 3-foot-high spurts of flame . He built an edible work of sculpture on the plate , carefully setting the tomatoes and onions around the shank of lamb . <p> After all the moves , disappointments and delays , Hope was home again .
