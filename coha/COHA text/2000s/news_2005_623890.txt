<p> The biggest financial decision many people will ever make is whether to take their money from a defined-benefit pension plan in a lump sum or in monthly payments . <p> Turmoil in the pension industry and the agency that guarantees corporate defined-benefit plans is making the decision harder . <p> Defined-benefit plans  --  the old-fashioned type of pension plan , run by the employer  --  must provide qualified retirees with a guaranteed monthly income for life , a type of payment called an annuity . <p> About half of these plans give retirees the option of taking their benefit in a single , one-time payment known as a lump sum . For people with long careers at the same company , the lump sum can reach well into the six figures . <p> By law , the lump sum must be the present value of the future stream of annuity payments , discounted by the 30-year Treasury bond rate over your life expectancy . Here 's a simpler way to think about it : <p> If you take the lump sum , invest it at the 30-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectancy and gradually withdraw the principal and interest , you will receive the same amount you would have gotten from the annuity . <p> The lump sum is a better deal if you die earlier and/or achieve a higher return than the 30-year Treasury bond , currently around 4.7 percent . <p> The annuity is a better deal if you live longer than expected and/or earn a lower rate of return than the bond . <p> The big risk with a lump sum is that you will mismanage it or spend too much of it , and run out of money before you die . A lesser risk is spending too little and going to the grave with a pile of money that could have made your twilight years more enjoyable . <p> The big danger with an annuity is that it wo n't keep up with inflation . Most corporate pensions do not provide cost-of-living increases . Many public-sector pensions do , although they may not keep up with living expenses . <p> Most financial advisers urge their clients to take the lump sum . But they 're hardly unbiased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lump sum . Many also believe they can beat the Treasury bond return and inflation  --  a feat that is easier said than done . <p> Kacy Gott , a wealth manager with Kochis Fitz , says his firm usually advises clients to take the lump sum , because " We will be managing the money , and we expect to be able to outperform over the long run . " <p> He says people who plan to manage it themselves , or do not have a long-term relationship with a trusted manager , are probably better off with an annuity . <p> Most retirement experts without a vested interest  --  such as those with universities and nonprofits  --  say retirees should take the annuity unless they are rich , terminally ill or have a huge pension . <p> The annuity " is one of the great benefits of defined-benefit plans , " says Alicia Munnell , director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College . Defined-contribution plans , such as 401(k) plans , generally do n't offer an annuity , leaving retirees to fend for themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority choose a lump sum . <p> " The percentage that takes them is very high , in the upper 80s , low 90s , " says Christine Tozzi , a senior retirement consultant with Watson Wyatt Worldwide , a benefits consultant . <p> Why do so many take the lump ? <p> " For a lot of people , it 's a very large sum of money , larger than they are likely to have seen before , " says Norma Stein , a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law . <p> In recent years , the interest rate used to convert an annuity to a lump sum has been unusually low , which has made lump sums unusually large and enticing . <p> There 's also a psychological aspect . " People have done so many experiments with individuals  --  offering them a flow of income or a pile of money , and they always take the pile of money . That 's why signing bonuses are so important . People will take less salary if you offer a signing bonus , " says Munnell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some employees look around . They 're reading all these things employers are doing with these plans . They say , ' Let me get the money out , be free of this employer , ' " says Stein . <p> When San Bruno resident Jim Prescott left Pacific Bell about 14 years ago , at age 48 , he was given the choice of taking his pension as an annuity or a five-figure lump sum . He figured the annuity would be the better deal financially but took the lump sum anyway . <p> " The annuity is promised , " he says , " but is it really promised ? " Prescott worried that if Pacific Bell was bought by another company ( which it subsequently was ) , the annuity might not be safe . <p> Such fears , while common , are overblown . <p> Pension insurance <p> Defined-benefit pension plans are legal obligations . If the company is taken over , the acquirer assumes those obligations . An employer can not cancel or modify pension benefits , as it can with retiree health benefits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to pay all the pensions that have been earned to date . But there is a fair amount of leeway in these rules , and pension plans can become underfunded . <p> If a company goes bankrupt and ca n't fully pay its pensions , the plan will be taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. , a federal corporation that insures private-sector pensions . Companies that sponsor defined-benefit plans pay insurance premiums to the pension agency . ( The agency does not guarantee public-sector pensions , because if they run short of money , taxpayers can bail them out . ) <p> When it takes over a plan , the agency assumes its assets and obligations . It will pay benefits , up to a certain limit , from the plan 's assets and insurance premiums . <p> For plans taken over in 2005 , the agency will pay up to $45,614 per year for those who retire at age 65 . The limit is higher for workers who retire later and lower for those who retire earlier or choose to receive benefits for a surviving spouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 but a person does not begin collecting benefits until later , the 2005 limits maximum still apply . <p> The agency says more than 90 percent of the people in plans it has taken over see no reduction in benefits . The biggest reductions happen when people earn pensions that significantly exceed the maximum benefit or provide generous early retirement subsidies . <p> The agency will not pay benefits in a lump sum unless the lump sum is $5,000 or less . <p> Some pilots for bankrupt United Airlines lost a large portion of their pensions because they had to retire early , their pensions exceeded the agency maximum and some of their benefits came from plans not covered by the agency . <p> In recent years , the agency has taken over so many underfunded plans , mostly from airlines and steel firms , that it is facing a deficit that could grow even larger with bankruptcies in the auto sector . <p> Last week , the agency said it ended fiscal 2005 year with a $22.8 billion deficit . It would have been $25.7 billion if it included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year on Sept. 30 ( possibly the bankruptcy of auto-parts maker Delphi ) . Last year 's deficit was $23.3 billion . <p> The agency is not guaranteed by the federal government . But many experts assume that if it became unable to pay out pensions , it would be rescued by Congress , in the same way it bailed out the savings and loan industry . <p> " There are just too many voters who would be impacted to let ( the agency ) go defunct , " says Gott . <p> The Senate last week passed a bill designed to shore up the pension system by increasing agency insurance premiums and tightening funding requirements . The House is expected to take up a similar bill . <p> For most people , it would be a mistake to let the pension industry 's problems push them into a lump sum . <p> " The average worker is facing very little risk , " says Purcell , an economist with the Congressional Research Service . <p> Taking the lump <p> There are a few groups of people for whom taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in a rare situation where your pension is likely to be greater than the agency maximum and in a plan with a strong likelihood of being taken over by the agency , " you should strongly consider taking the lump sum , says Purcell . " I would tell an airline pilot to take the lump sum , a flight attendant to take the annuity . " <p> People who are very well off and do n't need their pensions to live on might be safe taking a lump sum . They could invest it in the stock market , and if they do well , their heirs will get more . If they do badly , their heirs get less . <p> " If you have large consumer debt , that has a large negative return . Sometimes , taking the lump sum and retiring debt can make financial sense , " says Stein . <p> If you believe you are likely to die before your life expectancy , you should consider a lump sum . <p> The tables used to calculate lump sums assume that a 65-year-old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old will live 23.5 more years , a 55-year-old will live 28 years and a 50-year-old will live 32.7 years , according to Ron Gebhardtsbauer , senior pension fellow with the American Academy of Actuaries . <p> Taking the annuity <p> Most people underestimate how long they will live and how hard it will be to make a lump sum last a lifetime . That requires figuring how to invest and how much to take out each year . <p> " There has to be a coordinated strategy . It requires an incredible amount of skill , " says Stein . And it does n't get any easier with age . <p> Annuities from a pension plan are an especially good deal for women because , on average , they live longer than men . <p> Women get a bad deal when they take a lump sum from a pension plan because employers , by law , must use unisex life expectancy tables to calculate lump sums . <p> If they used gender-based tables , as insurance companies do when they sell annuities , women would get larger lump sums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal if the company subsidizes early retirement . <p> Some companies let employees retire before normal retirement age ( usually 65 ) with full benefits or with benefits that are only partially reduced . <p> This subsidy , however , might not be available if an employee takes a lump sum , says Tracy Witter , an actuary and principal with Mercer Human Resources Consulting . <p> New rules being phased in require companies to disclose whether the lump sum is less valuable than the annuity . If you 're not sure , ask .
