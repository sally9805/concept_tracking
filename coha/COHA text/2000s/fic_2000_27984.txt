Guantnamo Bay , on the southeast coast of the island of Cuba , is the prettiest spot on the planet , thought Rear Admiral Jake Grafton , USN . He was leaning on the railing on top of the carrier United States 's superstructure , her island , a place the sailors called Steel Beach . Here off-duty crew members gathered to soak up some rays and do a few calisthenics . Jake Grafton was not normally a sun worshiper ; at sea he rarely visited Steel Beach , preferring to arrange his day so that he could spend at least a half hour running on the flight deck . Today he was dressed in gym shorts , T-shirt , and tennis shoes , but he had yet to make it to the flight deck . Grafton was a trim , fit fifty-three years old , a trifle over six feet tall , with short hair turning gray , gray eyes , and a nose slightly too large for his face . On one temple was a scar , an old , faded white slash where a bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded him as the epitome of a competent naval officer . Grafton always put his brain in gear before he opened his mouth , never lost his cool , and he never lost sight of the goals he wanted to accomplish . In short , he was one fine naval officer and his superiors knew it , which was why he was in charge of this carrier group lying in Guantnamo Bay . The carrier and her escorts had been running exercises in the Caribbean for the last week . Today the carrier was anchored in the mouth of the bay , with two of her larger consorts anchored nearby . To seaward three destroyers steamed back and forth , their radarsprobing the skies . A set of top-secret orders had brought the carrier group here . Jake Grafton thought about those orders as he studied the two cargo ships lying against the pier through a set of navy binoculars . The ships were small , less than eight thousand tons each ; larger ships drew too much water to get against the pier in this harbor . They were Nuestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships here had not come from some windowless Pentagon cubbyhole ; it was no memo drafted by an anonymous civil servant or faceless staff weenie . Oh , no . The order that had brought those ships to this pier on the southern coast of Cuba had come from the White House , the top of the food chain . Jake Grafton looked past the cargo ships at the warehouses and barracks and administration buildings baking in the warm Cuban sun . A paradise , that was the word that described Cuba . A paradise inhabited by communists . And Guantnamo Bay was a lonely little American outpost adhering to the underside of this communist island , the asshole of Cuba some called it . Rear Admiral Grafton could see the cranes moving , the white containers being swung down to the pier from Astarte , which had arrived several hours ago . Forklifts took the steel boxes to a hurricane-proof warehouse , where no doubt the harbormaster was stacking them three or four deep in neat , tidy military rows . The containers were packages designed to hold chemical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew was here to load the weapons stored inside the hurricane-proof warehouse into the containers , which would then be loaded aboard the ship at the pier and transported to the United States , where the warheads would be destroyed . Loading the weapons into the containers and getting the containers stowed aboard the second ship was going to take at least a week , probably longer . The first ship , Nuestra Seora de Coln , Our Lady of Coln , had been a week loading , and would be ready to sail this evening . Jake Grafton 's job was to provide military cover for the loading operation with this carrier battle group . His orders raised more questions than they answered . The weapons had been stored in that warehouse for yearswhy remove them now ? Why did the removal operation require military cover ? What was the threat ? Admiral Grafton put down his binoculars and did fifty push-ups on the steel deck while he thought about chemical and biological weapons . Cheaper and even more lethal than atomic weapons , they were the weapons of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . Chemical weapons were easier to control than biological weapons , yet more expensive to deliver . Hands down , the cheapest and deadliest weapon known to man was the biological one . Almost any nation , indeed , almost anyone with a credit card and two thousand square feet of laboratory space , could construct a biological weapon in a matter of weeks from inexpensive , off-the-shelf technology . Years ago Saddam Hussein got into the biological warfare business with anthrax cultures purchased from an American mail-order supply house and delivered via overnight mail . Ten grams of anthrax properly dispersed can kill as many people as a ton of the nerve gas Sarin . What was that estimate Jake saw recently ? one hundred kilograms of anthrax delivered by an efficient aerosol generator on a large urban target would kill from two to six times as many people as a one-megaton nuclear device . Of course , Jake Grafton reflected , anthrax was merely one of over one hundred and sixty known biological warfare agents . There were others far deadlier but equally cheap to manufacture and disperse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step ; the journey from culture dishes to a reliable weapon that could be safely stored and accurately employedanything other than a spray tankwas long , expensive , and fraught with engineering challenges . Jake Grafton had had a few classified briefings about CBWwhich stood for chemical and biological warfarebut he knew little more than was available in the public press . These were n't the kinds of secrets that rank-and-file naval officers had a need to know . Since the Kennedy administration insisted on developing other military response capabilities besides nuclear warfare , the United States had researched , developed , and manufactured large stores of nerve gas , mustard gas , incapacitants , and defoliants . Research on biological agents went forward in tandem at Fort Detrick , Maryland , and ultimately led to the manufacture of weapons at Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas . These highly classified programs were undertaken with little debate and almost no publicity . Of course the Soviets had their own classified programs . Only when accidents occurredlike the accidental slaughter of 6,000 sheep thirty miles from the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sverdlovsk in 1979did the public get a glimpse into this secret world . Nerve gases were loaded into missile and rocket warheads , bombs , land mines , and artillery shells . Biological agents were loaded into missile warheads , cluster bombs , and spray tanks and dispensers mounted on aircraft . Historically nations used chemical or biological weapons against an enemy only when the enemy lacked the means to retaliate in kind . The threat of massive American retaliation had deterred Saddam Hussein from the use of chemical and biological weapons in the 1991 Gulf War , yet these days deterrence was politically incorrect . In 1993 the United States signed the Chemical Weapons Convention , thereby agreeing to remove chemical and biological weapons from its stockpiles . The U.S. military had been in no hurry to comply with the treaty , of course , because without the threat of retaliation there was no way to prevent these weapons being used against American troops and civilians . The waiting was over , apparently . The politicians in Washington were getting their way : the United States would not retaliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar weapons were used to slaughter Americans . When Jake Grafton finished his push-ups and stood , the staff operations officer , Commander Toad Tarkington , was there with a towel . Toad was slightly above medium height , deeply tanned , and had a mouthful of perfect white teeth that were visible when he smiled or laughed , which he often did . The admiral wiped his face on the towel , then picked up the binoculars and once again focused them on the cargo ships . " Glad the decision to destroy those things was n't one I had to make , " Toad Tarkington said . " There are a lot of things in this world that I 'm glad I 'm not responsible for , " Jake replied . " Why now , Admiral ? And why does the ordnance crowd need a battle group to guard them ? " " What I 'd like to know , " Jake Grafton mused , " is why those damned things were stored here in the first place . If we knew that , then maybe we would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Think Castro has chemical or biological weapons , sir ? " " I suspect he does , or someone with a lot of stars once thought he might . If so , our weapons were probably put here to discourage friend Castro from waving his about . But what is the threat to removing them ? " " Got to be terrorists , sir , " Toad said . " Castro would be delighted to see them go . An attack from the Cuban Army is the last thing on earth I would expect . But terroristsmaybe they plan to do a raid into here , steal some of the darn things . " " Maybe , " Jake said , sighing . " I guess I do n't understand why we are taking them home for destruction , " Toad added . " The administration got the political credit for signing the Chemical Weapons Treaty . If we keep our weapons , we can still credibly threaten massive retaliation if someone threatens us . " " Pretty hard to agree to destroy the things , not do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy theirs . " " Hypocrisy never slowed down a politician , " Toad said sourly . " I guess I just never liked the idea of getting naked when everyone else at the party is fully dressed . " " Who in Washington would ever authorize the use of CBW weapons ? " Jake muttered . " Can you see a buttoned-down , blow-dried , politically correct American politician ever signing such an order ? " Both men stood with their elbows on the railing looking at the cargo ships . After a bit the admiral passed Toad the binoculars . " Wonder if the National Security Agency is keeping this area under surveillance with satellites ? " Toad mused . " No one in Washington is going to tell us , " the admiral said matter-of-factly . He pointed to one of the two Aegis cruisers anchored nearby . " Leave that cruiser anchored here for the next few days . She can cover the base perimeter with her guns if push comes to shove . Have the cruiser keep her gun crews on five-minute alert , ammo on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pull the hook and join us , and another cruiser can come anchor here . " " Yes , sir . " " There 's a marine battalion landing team aboard Kearsarge , which is supposed to rendezvous with us tomorrow . I want Kearsarge to stay with United States . We 'll put both ships in a race-track pattern about fifty miles south of here , outside Cuban territorial waters , and get on with our exercises . But we 'll keep a weather eye peeled on this base . " " What about the base commander , sir ? He may know more about this than we do . " " Get on the ship-to-shore net and invite him to have dinner with me tonight . Send a helo in to pick him up . " " Sir , your instructions specifically directed that you maintain a business-as-usual security posture . " " I remember , " Jake said dryly . " Of course , business as usual ' is an ambiguous phrase , " Toad mused . " If anything goes wrong you can be blamed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind blows . " Jake Grafton snorted . " If a bunch of wild-eyed terrorists lay hands on those warheads , Tarkington , you and I will be fried , screwed , and tattooed regardless of what we did or did n't do . We 'll have to will our bodies to science . " " What about the CO of the cruiser , Admiral ? What do we tell him ? " " Draft a top-secret message directing him to keep his people ready to shoot . " " Aye , aye , sir . " " Nuestra Seora de Coln is sailing this evening for Norfolk . Have a destroyer accompany her until she is well out of Cuban waters . " " Yo . " Toad was making notes on a small memo pad he kept in his hip pocket . " And have the weather people give me a cloud-cover prediction for the next five days , or as far out as they can . I want to try to figure out what , if anything , the satellites might be seeing . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military ? " " Or terrorists . Whoever . " " I 'll take care of it , sir . " " I 'm going to run a couple laps around the deck , " Jake Grafton added . " May I suggest putting a company of marines ashore to do a security survey of the base perimeter ? Strictly routine . " " That sounds feasible , " Jake Grafton said . " Tonight let 's ask the base commander what he thinks . " " Yessir . " " Terrorists or the Cuban Armywanna bet ten bucks ? Take your pick . " " I only bet on sure things , sir , like prizefights and Super Bowls , occasionally a cockroach race . " " You 're wise beyond your years , Toad , " the admiral tossed over his shoulder as he headed for the hatch . " That 's what I tell Rita , " Toad shot back . Rita Moravia was his wife . Jake Grafton did n't hear the rest of Toad 's comment . " And wisdom is a heavy burden , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warheads . " He put the binoculars to his eyes and carefully studied the naval base .
