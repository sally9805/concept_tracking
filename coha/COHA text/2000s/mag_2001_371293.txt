Back when the U.S. fought wars abroad and crime at home  --  back when there was a difference between the two  --  it did n't matter if the CIA and the FBI hated each other . Or if the Pentagon had little interest in what New York City police were doing . Or if U.S. cops had no idea what their colleagues in France or Germany were up to . But in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks , all of them are working together as never before . Lawyers may debate whether to label the culprits from that day as conspirators in a crime or as soldiers in a war , but the investigators know they were both . So thousands of law-enforcement , intelligence and military investigators from two dozen Western nations have banded together with a common mission : to find out who pulled off the attacks and stop their compatriots from mounting any more . <P> There are two fronts in the investigative battle . A " clean " army of investigators pursues leads according to rules of evidence admissible in court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to build cases against alleged terrorists captured since Sept. 11 . President Bush said last week that nearly 150 suspected terrorists and supporters had been arrested in 25 countries . As of Sept. 30 , the U.S. Department of Justice had made 383 searches under warrants and issued 4,407 subpoenas . Court cases arising from these Herculean efforts will drag on for years . <P> The " dirty " teams work faster , less concerned with legal finery and more intent on making a quick , persuasive case to the world that the attacks are the handiwork of Osama bin Laden . On this track , the CIA and other nations ' intelligence agents use informants who are n't necessarily thuggish or unreliable but who could never appear in court ; to do so would risk revealing their sources . That 's why , as one CIA veteran puts it , " we only do dirty . " <P> No matter . The source of the information does n't matter to most people , who simply want to know if bin Laden did it . No significant military action can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  can assure their citizens that bin Laden is the man responsible for Sept. 11 . <P> Toward that end , the U.S. got a big boost last week from one of its staunchest allies . While the U.S. had presented its case against bin Laden to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization privately  --  asserting that secrecy is needed to protect sources  --  British Prime Minister Tony Blair last Thursday laid out much of that evidence for the world to see in a speech that was accompanied by a 4,500-word precis . ( Though the U.S. did n't orchestrate the release of the information , which included some intelligence collected not by the CIA but by British spies , it was vetted by U.S. intelligence and approved in advance by the White House . ) The British white paper alleges : <P>  --  One of bin Laden 's " close associates "  --  the British wo n't say who  --  helped plan the Sept. 11 attacks . <P>  --  In the weeks before the attacks , " close associates of bin Laden were warned to return to Afghanistan " by Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before 11 September that he was preparing a major attack on America .
