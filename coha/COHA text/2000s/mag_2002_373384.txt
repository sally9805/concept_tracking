When most of us are rolled into an operating room , the last thing we want to think about ( if we are conscious at all ) is what the doctors are putting inside us . We do n't want to know who donated the leg veins sometimes used for our coronary bypass operations or where the ligaments needed to hold a wobbly knee together were found . We want to be fixed , stitched up neatly , shipped out  --  and spared any gory details . <P> So it was more than a little disturbing last week when the Food and Drug Administration announced it was shutting down part of the facilities at CryoLife Inc. , a leading supplier of donated tissue in the U.S. The FDA charged that a number of the implants , which are processed ( in the industry euphemism ) from dead bodies and stored in tissue banks , had not been properly handled , leading to serious infections in at least 26 patients . The agency recalled tendons , ligaments and cartilage distributed by the Georgia-based company since October . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly , but the problems at CryoLife highlight concerns about quality control throughout the tissue-bank industry . ( By contrast , storage problems are simpler when harvesting whole organs like hearts and livers , which have to be transplanted immediately . ) " It 's almost like anybody with a chainsaw and a pickup truck can go into the body-harvesting business , " says Don Keenan , an Atlanta attorney representing 14 clients pursuing claims against CryoLife . One of them is the family of Brian Lykins , 23 , who died three days after what should have been routine orthopedic knee surgery last November . His death was caused by a strain of bacteria associated with decomposing tissue . " We know the cadaver that killed Brian was unrefrigerated for at least 19 hours , but nobody knows how long it had been dead before that , " says Keenan . Another teenager who received tissue from the same cadaver that infected Lykins also developed an infection and had to have his graft removed . <P> Oversight of the tissue industry is spotty . At the state level , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks . At the federal level , a 2001 report found that the FDA did not know how many tissue banks were operating and had never inspected 20% of the 154 facilities identified . But eventually the FDA , with help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , zeroed in on CryoLife . Together the agencies charge that on at least one occasion CryoLife improperly distributed tissue from a cadaver it had learned was contaminated . ( CryoLife could not confirm or deny that event . ) The industry standard is not to use any tissue from a corpse where any infectious tissue has been found  --  even if the two tissues were harvested from opposite ends of the body . " This has been going on this year and a good part of last year , " says Dr. Murray Lumpkin , an FDA commissioner . " We tried to work with CryoLife and get them in compliance , but it just did n't work . "
