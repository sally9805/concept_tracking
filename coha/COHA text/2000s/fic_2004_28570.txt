Chapter One Leenie checked the refrigerator for the third time . The bottles of milk were there , as she knew they would be . Just where she 'd put them . But she simply had to check a final time , had to make sure nothing had been left undone . After all , this was a turning point in her life , a make-or-break night . As she hurried by the computer desk in her kitchen , she glanced at the list of phone numbers posted by the telephone . Emergency numbers , her cell number , her private number at work , as well as the switchboard number . Rushing out of the kitchen and down the hall , her heartbeat rapid and her stomach painfully knotted , she wondered why this had to be so difficult . It was n't as if she was the first woman in the world to go through this painful separation . Millions of women throughout the world had done what she was doing and most of them could probably sympathize with her feelings of guilt and fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed her pace , took a deep breath and told herself that she could do this . She was a strong woman . An independent woman . When she reached the nursery , she looked from Debra , who smiled compassionately , to Andrew , who lay sleeping peacefully in his bed , totally unaware of the trauma his mother was experiencing . " Everything will be all right . " Debra draped her arm around Leenie 's shoulders . " You 'll be gone only a few hours and he 'll probably sleep the entire time you 're away . " " But if he wakes and I 'm not here ... " Leenie pulled away from her son 's nanny , walked over to Andrew 's bassinet and watched her six-week-old baby as he slept . His little chest rose and fell softly with each tender breath he took . She reached out to touch his rosy cheek . " If he wakes , I 'll be right here , " Debra assured her . " And if he 's hungry , you left breast milk in the fridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just going to work . " " Maybe we should postpone this another week or so . " Leenie could n't bear the thought of being separated from Andrew , even for the four hours it would take her to drive to WJMM , do her two-hour midnight talk-show on the radio , set things up for her morning TV show and then drive home . " No , we wo n't postpone it , " Debra said firmly . " We can continue taking Andrew to the station every morning for your daytime show , but he should n't be dragged out of his bed every night . " Debra crossed her arms over her chest and narrowed her gaze . " Go to work , Leenie . You do your job and let me do mine . " Sighing heavily , Leenie admitted her deepest fears . " But one of my jobs is being Andrew 's mother and if you do your job too well , my son will bond with you and not me . " Huffing loudly , but following up with an understanding smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonded with you . He knows you 're his mother . If I do my job well , and I 'd like to think I 've been doing that since the day we brought Andrew home from the hospital , then he 'll think of me as a favorite aunt or as a grandmother . " " I 'm being silly , are n't I ? " " No , you 're being a good mother . " " Am I a good mother ? I 'm not sure what makes a good mother . As you well know , I did n't have one of my own . No mother at all raised me , good , bad or otherwise . " " Jerry and I were parents to over fifty foster kids in our thirty years of marriage . " Debra sighed dreamily , as she always did whenever she mentioned her late husband , who had died two years ago at the age of sixty-three from a heart attack . " I 've seen all kinds of mothers and I know a good one from a bad one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were certainly an excellent role model for me when I lived with you and Jerry . I learned by watching the way you were with all of us foster children what a good mother is . " She had been fifteen when she 'd been sent to live with Debra and Jerry Schmale , a young minister and his wife who 'd been told they could never have children of their own and had decided they would give their love and time to unwanted , neglected kids of all ages . The three years she 'd spent with the Schmales had been the best years of her childhood . " You , Dr. Lurleen Patton , are a good mother , " Debra said . " Even though I 'm a single parent ? Even though I did n't provide Andrew with a father ? " " You told me that Andrew was the result of a very brief affair with a man you barely knew . A man who showed no interest in settling down . A man who was very careful to use protection each time y'all made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , that protection failed . Otherwise , I would n't have gotten pregnant . But that was n't Frank 's fault . " " You made the decision not to tell Andrew 's father about his existence because you felt it was the best thing for everyone concerned . Right ? " " Right . " " Have you changed your mind ? " No , she had n't changed her mind . Although , truth be told , sometimes she wished she had called Frank the day she 'd found out she was pregnant , called him and told him he was going to be a daddy . But she 'd been so shocked herself that it had taken her weeks to figure out what to do . By the time she decided she wanted to keep her baby and raise it herself , she had also decided that the last thing Frank Latimer would want in his life was a child . Their entire relationship had lasted less than two weeks . Love had n't been involved . Just a major case of lust . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a child , it would simply complicate his life and mine , not to mention Andrew 's . " Debra turned Leenie around , grasped her shoulders and all but shoved her out of the room . " If you do n't leave now , you 'll be late . " Debra walked Leenie into the hallway and all the way to the back door . " Call me every thirty minutes , if that will make you feel better - but go . Now ! " Leenie sighed . " Thanks . I do n't know what I 'd do without you . Sometimes I think I need you even more than Andrew does . " ( Continues ... )
