Finally , a proven solution for firmer and smoother legs <p> Cottage cheese thighs . Seems that no matter how much you diet or how much money you spend on products and potions , those ugly , orange-peel bumps are still there , stuck to your bottom half and impossible to conquer . <p> Well , get ready to win ! We 're going to show you how to shed cellulite without expensive wraps , creams , or supplements . The best part : It takes only 20 minutes , 3 days a week . <p> " With the right exercise plan , you can reduce cellulite and make your lower body look smoother and firmer , " says Prevention advisor Wayne L. Westcott , PhD , who recently developed the Cellulite Solution Exercise Plan . " When we put 16 women ages 26 to 66 on our program for 8 weeks , all of them reported less cellulite in their lower body . And 70% of them reported a lot less . " <p> It was n't just wishful thinking . On average , the women lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of muscle , and shed almost 11/2 inches from their hips . What 's more , ultrasound tests confirmed it . Overall , the women shrank the lumpy fat layer on their thighs by 1.3 millimeters ( mm ) and increased smooth muscle tissue in the same area by 1.8 mm . It does n't sound like much , but it definitely made their legs look smoother and firmer . The Truth about Cellulite <p> The best part of this program is that it puts to rest the mistaken notion that cellulite is some mysterious condition . Despite what you 've heard about trapped toxins or poor circulation being to blame , cellulite is one thing-fat . It just looks different because of how it 's arranged . <p> Everyone has strands of connective tissue that separate fat cells into compartments and connect fat tissue to skin . In women , these fibers form a honeycomb-like pattern , so any increase of fat in a given area tends to bulge . You do n't see cellulite in men because their fibers run in a horizontal , criss-cross pattern that prevents bulging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear out of nowhere and get worse as we get older ? There are two reasons . First , it 's because tissue changes . Those strands of connective tissue thicken with age , and our skin gets thinner , says Katie Rodan , MD , clinical assistant professor of dermatology at Stanford University . " The combined effect is more pronounced cellulite , " she explains . <p> Second , and more important , the average woman loses 5 lb of muscle and replaces it with about 15 lb of fat every decade of her adult life , says Dr. Westcott . " Because fat is exceptionally soft , it does n't keep our skin taut like muscle does . It also takes up more space , so it bulges out . " <p> To get rid of cellulite , you have to reduce the underlying fat stores and replace lost muscle tissue . " You wo n't find a cellulite cure in cosmetic products or procedures , " says Jeffrey Sklar , MD , assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University in New York City . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem it will be . " The Cellulite Solution Exercise Plan <p> Follow this three-step , 20-minute program 3 days a week , and watch those ripples disappear . <p> Step 1 : Cardio Warm up with 2 minutes of moderate walking , cycling , or stairclimbing ( you can use indoor stationary machines ) . Increase intensity for 8 minutes . Work vigorously enough to be breathing hard but still able to talk in short sentences . Lower the intensity , and cool down for 2 minutes . <p> Step 2 : Strength Do one set of 10 to 15 repetitions of each of the following exercises , using a heavy-enough weight to fatigue the muscles . ( This is essential for optimum muscle building in these areas . ) Your muscles are fatigued when you feel as though you ca n't do even one more repetition . When you can easily complete 15 reps , increase the weight slightly . Work slowly , counting 2 seconds to lift and 4 seconds to lower . <p> Step 3 : Flexibility After each strength training exercise , you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , holding for 20 seconds . Dr. Westcott has found that adopting this stretching strategy can boost strength training results by 20% .

Slowly squeeze your legs together against the resistance of the ball as hard as you can , making sure to keep your knees bent slightly .

QUICK TIP <p> Avoid crash dieting ; it can make cellulite worse . When you lose weight quickly , you lose muscle tissue-the stuff that makes your legs and butt look toned and smooth . Rub It Out : Do Cosmetic Solutions Work ? <p> About 85% of adult women have some cellulite . That means big money for people who sell cellulite treatments . But be careful before plunking down cash for so-called cures . Most provide only marginal , if any , benefits . And many are expensive . Here 's a look at some common treatments . Creams . Though they do n't produce dramatic results , creams can temporarily change the appearance of cellulite , according to Katie Rodan , MD , of Stanford University . " Creams containing caffeine pull some fluid from your cells , making cellulite slightly less noticeable , " she explains . Supplements . Save your money on cellulite supplements such as Cellasene . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Jeffrey Sklar , MD , director of the Center for Aesthetic Dermatology in Woodbury , NY . " Also , they may contain stimulants and blood thinners , ingredients that are potentially harmful to people with heart problems or bleeding disorders . " The Federal Trade Commission recently sued Rexall Sundown , the makers of Cellasene , for allegedly misleading consumers with false ads claiming that Cellasene supplements can eliminate cellulite . Massage/Endermologie . Some people believe that deep massage can help smooth out the clumping of fat that causes cellulite . " Deep massage does appear to help it look better temporarily , " says Dr. Rodan . That 's also the theory behind Endermologie , a high-tech rolling and suction treatment okayed by the FDA to temporarily improve the appearance of cellulite . Does it work ? " For some people , " says Dr. Sklar . But you need continual treatments to maintain results . Priced at about $1,600 for twenty 40-minute treatments , it 's a lot of money for something that does n't last . Liposuction . Forget it . This surgery can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no guarantee that the tissue that remains will appear any smoother . In fact , it may look even bumpier . Got More Time ?
