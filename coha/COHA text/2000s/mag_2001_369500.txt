Getting ahead in Africa is tough . Banks lend money only to the middle class and the wealthy . Poor Africans  --  meaning most Africans  --  stay poor . It 's even harder if you 're sick . Without savings to fall back on , many HIV-positive parents pull their kids out of school . They ca n't afford the fees and end up selling their few possessions to feed the family . When they die , their kids are left with nothing . <P> Though not directly targeted at people with AIDS , microcredit schemes go some way toward fixing that problem . The schemes work like minibanks , lending small amounts  --  often as little as $100  --  to traders or farmers . Because they lack the infrastructure of banks and do n't charge fees , most charge an interest rate of as much as 1% a week and repayment rates of over 99%  --  much better than that for banks in Africa , or in most places . <P> Many microcredit schemes encourage clients to set aside some of the extra income generated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills or to pay school fees if the parents get sick . " Without the loans I would have had to look for another way to make money , " says Florence Muriungi , 40 , who sings in a Kampala jazz band and whose husband died of AIDS four years ago . Muriungi , who cares for eight children  --  five of her own and three her sister left when she too died of AIDS  --  uses the money to pay school fees in advance and fix her band 's equipment . Her singing generates enough money for her to repay the loans and save a bit . <P> Seventeen of the 21 women at a weekly meeting of regular borrowers in Uganda care for AIDS orphans . Five are AIDS widows . " I used to buy just one or two bunches of bananas to sell . Now I buy 40 , 50 , 60 , " says Elizabeth Baluka , 47 , the group 's secretary . " Every week I put aside a little bit of money to help my children slowly by slowly . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
