February 6 , 1750 <p> <br> Westing house Manor <p> <br> Bedfordshire , England <p> " Comtesse de Fournier ? Is that you , my lady ? " The voice held not the slightest edge of fear , confirming Rose 's suspicions . Sir Walter Pithwater knew little of the history of his people . To night , that shameful gap in his education would hasten his journey to the grave . <p> Rose crept slowly through the garden 's maze , grateful the hedges had yet to reach their full height . Pithwater was clearly visible above the top of the shrubbery , his bald head gleaming in the moonlight , while her own figure remained concealed . True , she was barely five feet and two in her heeled slippers  --  but even Lord Drummand , the host of the country party and a man close to six feet , would be largely concealed . The people of the tribe were simply unusually tall , and Sir Walter was no exception . <p> It was one of the clues that had alerted her to the ogre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A late-night venture down to the earl 's kitchens confirmed her worst fears . The cook needed little prying to confess she worried the baronet would eat her employers out of house and home , forcing them to end their party early and disgrace themselves in front of many influential friends and members of Society . <p> The woman should have been more concerned about the ravenous guest eating her out of chambermaids and stable boys . Two of the house hold staff had gone missing in the past week . Rose doubted their bodies would ever be found . Ogres were unique among supernatural predators in that they ate the entirety of their victims  --  bones and all . <p> " Comtesse ? Is that your delicate step I hear ? " Pithwater called again , a suggestive lilt in his tone . " Come out , come out , my little rosebud . " <p> Rose grimaced beneath the black hood concealing her powdered blond curls from the light of the moon . She had been christened Rosemarie , and allowed a select few to call her Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially when they sprung from the mouth of a repulsive goat like Pithwater . <p> Still , she had no one but herself to blame . <p> She had led the man to believe she was penniless and in need of a protector , lest she follow in the footsteps of other impoverished women of standing who lived their lives in the shadows of polite society as courtesans . Nothing had been said outright , all communicated in hushed intimations as such things usually were , but Pithwater had taken the bait . <p> He 'd invited her to the garden maze to night for what she gathered was a trial of sorts , to see if she would please him as a mistress . The reward for his plea sure would be her own cottage near Marylebone Gardens and an allowance he had named generous , but which they both knew to be hundreds of pounds short of a livable sum . Not that the allowance was of any real consequence . <p> Rose knew what her fate would truly be  --  a few months in his bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human lover for long , no matter how fetching they found them . Their appetite for flesh always outweighed their desire for carnal pleasure . <p> " I see . . . You wish to play the fox and the rabbit , eh ? " She heard Pithwater move through the maze , closer to her position . " But who will be the fox and who the rabbit ? " <p> There was a question she would most happily answer . " I shall be the fox , Sir Walter . " <p> " So it is you , my lady . " The arousal was clear in his voice . Revulsion served to steady Rose 's hand as she threw back her hood and reached between her shoulders for the handle of her blade . The sheath ran the length of her spine and under a dancing partner 's hands felt like nothing more dangerous than the bones of her stays . " I would think a dear little thing like you would prefer to leave the foxing to those with more natural aptitude for the art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly noble to insult a lady 's aptitude . " Rose maintained an edge of coyness in her tone while increasing her volume , guiding Pithwater to her location . <p> The handle of her blade thickened and grew longer in her grasp , a result of the faerie magic that had created it . Rose braced herself for the killing blow , knowing she would need a clean cut if she hoped to fell him in one stroke . Unfortunately , there had n't been time to change out of her evening gown after the formal dinner . As a result , she would n't be as sure on her feet . <p> In recent years , she had made a habit of dressing as a young boy on the evenings she hunted the members of the tribe . It was easier to move freely in male clothing . So much easier , in fact , she began to suspect feminine fashion a plot to keep females docile and submissive . <p> After all , how could one think on matters of country , estate , or Society , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath unencumbered ? <p> Of course , she did love the frock she was wearing , a pale blue and gray sateen with a pearl inlaid stomacher that had cost nearly as much as the " generous " yearly allowance she would have as Pithwater 's mistress . It made her hope the man 's blood would n't spray too madly . Ogre bloodstains were nearly impossible to remove . <p> " My dearest rosebud , I do not doubt your aptitude in the slightest . If that were the case , I most certainly would not have initiated such a . . . " Pithwater rounded the corner of the hedge , emerging not five feet from where she stood . His eyes , still sunken in his skull despite the human flesh he had consumed , widened at the sight of the sword in her hand . " My lady ? " <p> " Your people call me Briar Rose . She of many thorns . " <p> Rose closed the distance between them in seconds . Before the light of recognition in Sir Pithwater 's eyes could translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feat made easier by the fact that her raised arms were nearly level with his waist . <p> With a great wail , the baronet fell to the ground . His head and torso flew backward , arms still . ailing mightily , while his hips and legs tipped forward , spraying blood and gore like a font . <p> " Blast , " Rose cursed as the thick , black sludge splashed her dress and cape . She should have known better . He had fed on human flesh too recently to have a sluggish heartbeat . <p> Now blood coated not only her dress , but her gloves , cloak , and face as well . She swiped at her cheek , trying not to gag at the stench . Pithwater had been of the tribe ; she had not been mistaken in that . His essence reeked of bile and rot . <p> But then , she had never been wrong , never drawn her sword to find out too late the creature she hunted was anything other than an abomination . That fact gave her comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undo her . This , however , was not one of those nights . Other than the spray , Pithwater had been delightfully easy prey . Almost too easy . It left her with an " unfinished " feeling about the entire business . <p> Apparently , she was n't the only one . <p> " Truly , Rose , could you have not let the man run a bit ? Given him a few moments to plead for his wretched life ? Something ? " Gareth Barrows slunk from the darkness with a sigh , his footsteps as silent as the shadows themselves . " This was hardly worth the time it took to travel from the city . " <p> " This is n't a game , Mr. Barrows . I make the kill to accomplish the task , not for the sport of the matter . " Rose sheathed her blade , her voice more sour than it might have been if she had n't presently been covered in ogre blood . She had been attempting to be patient with her latest protTgT , a vampire of nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense than a child . <p> He had volunteered his time to aid in controlling the ogre population of Great Britain , a far from magnanimous act as the exploding numbers of the tribe negatively affected his own hunting grounds . Still , volunteer or no , he could have brought more dedication to his training . In the fortnight since they had been introduced by her liaison among the Fey de la Nuit , he had failed to show for four of his seven assignments . He seemed to think a charming smile at their next meeting was sufficient apology for the time she wasted sending him endless communiquTs , and that there was little he could learn about killing he had n't mastered in his years as a creature of the night . <p> Irritatingly , the rascal was usually . Must I remind you , Mr. Barrows , that supernatural strength and a pair of sharp teeth will not  --  " <p> " Not another lecture on the reasons I should n't play with my food , dearest . I do n't think I could bear that particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed , smoothing a hand over the dark brown hair tied at the nape of his neck . <p> Rose had never seen him without a wig before and some foolish part of her wished the moonlight were brighter , for she suspected he looked quite fine . In over a hundred years of working with breathtaking vampires , she had never allowed a professional relationship to become anything more , but that did n't mean she could n't enjoy a pleasant view . <p> " I could n't care less what you do with your food , sir , only with the ogres who will be your prey , " Rose said , blushing a bit in spite of herself . " Remember , Mr. Barrows , never  --  " <p> " Ingest the blood of an ogre . I understood that directive the first twelve times . As if I would be foolish enough to sink my teeth into anything so rancid . " His green eyes shone like a cat 's , catching unseen light and flaring in the darkness . He moved closer and Rose did her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her origins , and she meant to keep it that way . " In addition , I 'm fairly certain strength alone will be sufficient . I 've killed many a mortal scoundrel with nothing more than my bare hands . " <p> " But did you rip their body in two , top cleanly separated from the bottom ? " she asked , refusing to retreat when he moved so close she could feel the heat of his body . He had fed , and very recently if the flush in his cheeks was any clue . <p> " No , I 've never ripped anyone asunder . " His hands moved to her waist . Rose managed  --  just barely  --  not to . inch at the contact . " But I imagine I could accomplish the business without the aid of a weapon . " <p> His large hands encircled her waist and squeezed none too gently . Rose sucked in a surprised breath , more from the unexpected heat curling low in her belly than from any real fear . Of course , Gareth had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fey de la Nuit . He might assume she could take more damage than was safe . <p> " Please , " she said , not trusting herself to look him in the eye a moment longer . It had been far too long since she 'd had a companion of any sort , but especially that sort , and her body was aching to betray her . <p> " Please what , Rose ? " His warm breath puffed against the top of her head and she fought the desire to lift her face and find the source of that breath with her mouth . " You are a beautiful woman , you must know that . But for all your beauty you act as if  --  " <p> " Wait , " Rose whispered , turning to search the shadows . She was certain she had heard a sound , but now all was quiet . She tried to pull away , but Gareth held her fast . <p> " I wo n't wait . I 'm dying of curiosity . We all are . They 've taken bets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose threw her weight to the right , but her strength was not sufficient to move them both out of danger . The ogre diving toward them caught Gareth 's cloak in his hands , and took the vampire to the ground . <p> " Damnation ! " Rose scrambled to her feet , throwing off her cape as she reached for her blade . But before she could grasp the handle , she was hit from behind and went tumbling back to the earth . <p> " Such coarse language , " a homely , black-haired female of the tribe hissed as Rose closed her hands around the ogress 's throat . She lacked the strength to choke the other woman , but she at least hoped to keep the creature 's teeth from her flesh . " But you are n't truly a comtesse at all , are you , Briar Rose ? " <p> She lunged forward with a snarl just as Rose relaxed her arms and shifted to the right . The ogress howled as her face connected with the muddy earth and Rose  --  via pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoops and heavy skirts  --  rolled atop her . Rose was reaching for her blade a second time when a hand fisted in her hair and pulled her backward . <p> She screamed as she was dragged several feet , cursing her aversion to wigs . If she had worn one this evening she might have freed herself without having hair pulled out by the root . Still , better no hair than no flesh . <p> Rose dug her hands into the dirt and jerked her neck forward , crying out as a fistful of blond locks remained behind in her would-be captor 's hands . <p> " Behind you , Rose ! " She was scrambling to her feet yet again , but at Gareth 's shout rolled back to the ground , only daring to stand when she had put several feet between herself and the scuffle taking place at the center of the maze . <p> " Dear God , " she breathed as she finally managed to free her blade . Now that she had a clear look at what she and Gareth were pitted against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The first three ogres had been joined by two more , and from the sounds echoing through the night air , they would soon be welcoming even more company . There was no longer any doubt . Pithwater  --  whether he 'd been aware of it or not  --  had been bait , a lure to get Rose to the maze , far from the house where the humans slept and even farther from the dark faeries who would have come to her aid in any parish in En gland . After nearly a hundred years the ogres had grown bold , or else she had grown careless . <p> Whichever the case , she would soon see if she would walk free of this dark garden , or if Lord and Lady Drummand would be missing more than one guest come morning . <p> " Presumably they will be more troubled by my absence than that of the chambermaid or stable boy , " Rose muttered before she raised her sword and threw herself into the fray . <p> Excerpted from Night 's Rose by ANNALIESE EVANS <br> Copyright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Doherty Associates
