It 's never easy to talk to patients about getting their colon probed from the inside by a 5-ft. - long tube , but it 's a lot easier than it used to be , thanks to NBC host Katie Couric . After she lost her husband Jay Monahan , 42 , to colon cancer in 1998 , she launched a campaign to raise awareness of the importance of regular screenings  --  a campaign that may have done more than any doctor could to get people to make that crucial appointment . After Couric bravely had her colon screened on national television in 2000 , researchers at the University of Michigan reported a 20% increase in the number of scheduled colonoscopies . It came to be known as the Couric effect . So when I heard the news last week about the risk of colon cancer for smokers and drinkers , one of my first calls was to Couric . A study of more than 160,000 colon-cancer patients published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that the cancers of patients who smoked tobacco or drank alcohol were diagnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other patients . If you smoke as well as drink , the study suggests , your cancer is likely to be diagnosed almost eight years earlier . <P> Those are findings that ought to get people in bars across America thinking twice about their bad habits , because the implication is that smokers and drinkers should be getting screened earlier than ever for colorectal cancer . Doctors usually recommend that patients schedule their first exam on or near their 50th birthday . If you get a colonoscopy  --  considered the gold standard of screenings because it allows doctors to examine the whole length of the lower intestine and snip off any precancerous polyps they find  --  you may not need to be screened again for 10 years . If you use one of the less definitive tests  --  a flexible sigmoidoscopy , barium enema or simple stool analysis  --  you should get tested more frequently . <P> Couric was on vacation last week , but she got right back to me by e-mail . " Fear and embarrassment are major obstacles , " she wrote , " but educated , well-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get over those feelings . The time to be screened for colon cancer is when you are feeling well and not having symptoms . " <P> She 's right , of course . Colorectal cancer remains one of the top three causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. ( after lung and breast cancer ) , but it does n't have to be ; 90% of cases detected early can be cured . <P> Meanwhile , there are plenty of steps you can take to improve your odds . Exercise is good for both your heart and your colon . You should also try to eat less red meat ( which stresses the digestive system ) and more vegetables , fruit and  --  above all  --  fiber . Obviously , given the news last week , you need to think about cutting back on your drinking  --  and , for goodness ' sake , stop smoking ( or , if you 've never started , keep up the good work ) . <P> Nobody , not even Couric , likes to talk about getting their backside probed , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heck of a lot easier than facing a diagnosis of colon cancer .
