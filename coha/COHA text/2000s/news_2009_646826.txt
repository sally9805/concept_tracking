BAGHDAD  --  In Maj. Thomas Jarrett 's stress management class surrounded by concrete blast walls , American troops are urged not to accept post-traumatic stress disorder as an inevitable consequence of war . <p> Instead , Jarrett tells them to strive for " post-traumatic growth . " <p> During a 90-minute presentation titled " Warrior Resilience and Thriving , " Jarrett , a former corporate coach , offers this and other unconventional tips on how servicemembers can stay mentally healthy once they return home . He quotes Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius , Paradise Lost author John Milton and German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , among others . <p> Walking through the crowd of young GIs in the makeshift classroom , Jarrett urges them to fight their " internal insurgents . " <p> The overriding theme of the course : Servicemembers have the power to determine how they react to the horrors they may experience in Iraq . They can either accept them as traumatizing events , or transform them into learning  --  even empowering  --  experiences . <p> " Pain is inevitable . Suffering is optional , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of instructors . <p> The class is part of an urgent initiative aimed at halting an epidemic of suicides , which has killed almost as many U.S. servicemembers this year as combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan combined . The trend has left top military psychologists puzzled and resulted in a new emphasis on programs that alleviate stress and prevent possible suicides while troops are still on the battlefield , where doctors say many mental health problems begin . <p> To that end , every soldier arriving in Iraq is now handed a card detailing the warning signs for depression and suicide . Two-star generals appear on the Armed Forces Network talking about their experiences with mental health specialists and how it helped . And mental health experts are spending more time on the front lines to make the counseling process informal and accessible to troops who may be reluctant about seeking out a psychiatrist . <p> The challenge is to get soldiers to open up about their troubles and to break what Lt. Col. Peyton Hurt , the senior psychiatrist in Iraq , calls the old Army way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We 're rolling out program after program and making a very concerted effort at lots of levels , " Hurt said . " The government is just pouring money into this stuff right now . " <p> In January , suspected suicides in the Army reached an all-time monthly high of 24 , doubling the number of combat deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan combined , according to military data . ( Military investigators often take months to confirm suicide as the cause of death . ) The number of suspected suicides was 18 in February . <p> The majority of the suicides have occurred once troops return home to the USA , but Hurt and other doctors say the problems tend to take root while troops are still at war , meaning it 's crucial to address their mental health as early as possible . <p> The strains that the armed forces have endured as they fight two long wars are well-documented : extended deployments , a rash of brain injuries and sometimes insufficient military health care , among others . <p> But military psychologists and troops in Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ranged from boredom as combat operations cease in Iraq to , paradoxically , the improvement in communications that allows troops to keep in better touch with their loved ones  --  but also immerses them in family problems while they 're still at war . <p> Ultimately , Hurt says the military is n't really sure what 's causing the suicides . He has hope in programs like Jarrett 's , but he also worries that the military 's outreach effort relies on " marketing " techniques to make troops aware of the problem without adequately addressing the core causes . <p> " I do n't want to be cynical about it , but I 'm not convinced that necessarily it 'll make much difference , " Hurt said . " It might . We do n't know . " <p> Enormous time pressures <p> Hurt says the military has worked hard to overcome the traditional stigma associated with mental health issues  --  one that , despite the hard-learned lessons of previous wars , prevailed again early in the Iraq war . <p> Lt. Col. Benjamin Matthews says he laughed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was a young lieutenant in Somalia during the Black Hawk Down incident , where 18 Americans were killed and more than 80 others were wounded . <p> " I got two 800-milligram Motrins and was told ' Go back out and fight , " Matthews said . <p> He said there was also little opportunity for counseling during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the months following because it was such a " mobile battlefield . " He said soldiers were so focused on securing cities and establishing bases throughout the country that there was no time to get stressed . " The only stress you had was a lack of sleep , " he said . <p> In 2006 , Joshua Moreland , an Army staff sergeant who is serving his second tour in Iraq , said he rarely spoke about the roadside bomb that hit his convoy of Humvees in Samarra that year . He did n't speak to a chaplain , a counselor or even his wife . <p> His wife did n't find out about the blast until he returned home and she asked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat action badge he received for the bombing . Even then , he barely spoke of it . " She wanted me to , " Moreland said . " But I did n't want her to worry . I knew I was coming back again . " <p> During a deployment near Baghdad 's explosive Sadr City from 2006 to 2007  --  the peak years of the sectarian violence  --  Sgt. Christopher Dunne said his unit was hit by roadside bombs five times . Six soldiers in his unit died . He lost count of the number of firefights they got into . <p> Yet Dunne , 25 , a father of two from Kansas City , Kan. , said the option of mental health counseling was never there . <p> " There were people who were messed up , " Dunne said . " A program can be there six , eight years , whatever , but it does n't matter if nobody knows about it . I know guys in my unit that could 've used the programs . " <p> More assessments being done <p> Now the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences . That 's why counselors are spending more time closer to the fighting front . Just as most units have a doctor that they become familiar with , Hurt said they are trying to use the same principle with counselors . <p> " It 's different if you know the guy , " Hurt said . " If I sit next to you in the chow line and we chat and you seem like a regular guy , I may be happy to talk to you about all my stuff because you 're going to get it . " <p> All troops leaving combat undergo a Post Deployment Health Assessment to screen for signs of depression , PTSD and other mental health problems . Four years ago , the Army added another round of screening after the troops return home . The Post Deployment Health Reassessment is now done three to six months after soldiers return to ensure that they are adjusting to life . <p> " You 've got to figure out what 's effective . It 's a long , complicated road to figure it out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much stress as possible to minimize suicidal tendencies , he said . <p> On his second tour , Dunne said things are completely different . He said they are receiving briefings from mental health experts that are catered to their phase of deployment : the first 100 days , the middle of the tour , the last 100 days and adjusting to life back home . <p> " The briefs have been more often . More targeted , " he said . <p> Matthews now sees the mental health of his soldiers as a critical aspect of his job and as a way to prevent suicides . <p> " I call it ' getting personal with your personnel , " Matthews said . " I know who the high-risk soldiers are , and I know who the lower-risk soldiers are . I know which soldiers have a privately owned weapon . I know the soldiers who have motorcycles . I know the soldiers who party hard at night . <p> " It 's not about invasion of on a systemwide approach to mental health , the security situation on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give . <p> When violence peaked in Iraq during 2006 and 2007 , it was clear what psychiatrists had to watch for . <p> " Usually , it was something really horrific , like ' The guy next to me was cut in half by a ( bomb ) or ' My truck commander 's head was blown off and his severed head hit my head and knocked me out , " said Navy Capt . Gregory Firman , a Vietnam War veteran who runs a PTSD clinic in Massachusetts and has counseled troops in Iraq . <p> As the pace of the war has slowed and troops transition into more of a peacekeeping and advisory role to the Iraqis , troops are struggling to downshift . <p> " I 've had guys say , ' This is my fourth tour here , and I have n't done anything . I have n't shot my weapon once , " said Maj. Kevin Gormley , commander of the 98th Combat Stress Control unit stationed in Baghdad . " And I say , ' That 's a good thing , right ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pfc . Joe Funderburk said he 's tried to settle into life at Camp Liberty . He and his roommate separated their room with their two wall lockers to give a sense of privacy . Funderburk put up pictures of his mother and father . He put up a flag of his alma mater , Alabama . He bought a rug at the military store to make the small room feel homier . He works out , watches DVDs , anything to pass the time . <p> " But you do get kind of stir crazy , " he said . <p> Navy Lt. Edmund Clark , a psychiatrist at Camp Liberty , said the lack of constant fighting does n't mean a tranquil state of relaxation , either . Battles are still raging around the northern city of Mosul and other parts of the country and car bombs and mortar attacks still target Americans , if not as frequently . <p> Clark said the constant threat of the infrequent , random attack is still a heavy burden for any American in Iraq . <p> He said the slower tempo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much contact with relatives . Soldiers have more down time and more access to satellite phones and computers  --  where soldiers can e-mail , instant message or video chat with their families . <p> Clark said in previous wars , when communication amounted to maybe a letter a month , family problems would usually be resolved without any input , or stress , from the deployed soldier . Now , soldiers are in the middle of any problem back home . <p> " I 've had to encourage commands to keep their soldiers engaged , have them do something , have them stay busy with something , " Clark said . " Because having them just sit and instant message with the girlfriend that 's cheating on him  --  that kind of thing is not always helpful . " <p> Tragedy not always traumatic <p> The Army provides marriage counselors , financial assistance and several other " family readiness " programs to help soldiers straighten out their lives back home . But it 's now up to people like Jarrett and his instructors to get their soldiers straight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from committing suicide . <p> Venutto , the instructor , explains how a soldier will become traumatized and depressed if that is what they expect to happen following a tragedy . If you expect to suffer , you will . <p> He urges them instead to listen to the words of Epictetus , a former Greek slave turned stoic philosopher . " It is not the thing itself , but the view we take of it which disturbs us , " the quote reads . <p> During a break in a recent class , Jarrett said the military had no such training when he was in the 82nd Airborne Division in the early 1980s , or during his first tour in Baghdad in 2005 . <p> As he saw the war in Iraq escalating and kept hearing reports of soldiers struggling to cope with the stresses , the 47-year-old corporate coach who was working toward a doctorate returned to the military and started the training course . <p> To explain its purpose , he points back to his home in Maplewood , N.J. , and a weed that was growing outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed killers . He doused it in gasoline . But still , it grew . <p> " Everything I did to it caused it to be stronger , " Jarrett said . Completing the analogy , he explained that " soldiers are made stronger by what they go through . " <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
