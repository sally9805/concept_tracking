STORING : If kept dry and covered in the refrigerator , enclosed in a paper bag or covered with paper towels in a basket , mushrooms should stay fresh for several days . Wait to wash them until just before using . CLEANING : Tdm off tough or discolored bottoms of mushroom stems and any bruised spots or blemishes . ( For shiitakes and oysters , remove the entire fibrous stem . ) For firm mushrooms such as portabellas , wipe dirt off with a damp cloth or place in a colander , rinse thoroughly under cool running water , and pat dry with towels . For delicate mushrooms that have lots of places for dirt to hide , such as chanterelles and hedgehogs , submerge in a bowl of cool water and gently agitate with your hands to loosen any particles . Drain , rinse carefully under running water , and gently pat dry with a towel . // <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
