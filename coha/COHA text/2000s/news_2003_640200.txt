<p> President Bush slowly works the room , moving from one grieving family member to another . <p> At every family gathered in a special room at Fort Carson , the president stops . He offers comforting words , and sometimes a hug . <p> Then he gets to 4-year-old Dustin Lawton . <p> ' My daddy is dead , ' Dustin says to the president . He says it to nearly everyone he meets . <p> Sherri Lawton holds her breath . <p> She thinks Bush must have heard Dustin , but it would be so easy for him to act as if he has n't and just keep moving . <p> Bush stops . <p> He turns to look at the boy , and bends down . <p> ' I know he is dead , son , ' the president says . <p> When Sherri Lawton 's husband went to war , she believed he would be home by Christmas . <p> She believed he would be there to see Dustin open the gift her husband most wanted to give him this year , a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . She believed he would be there to hold 18-month-old Tanner and bounce him on his knee . <p> But Mark Lawton , a 41-year-old Army staff sergeant from Hayden , a small town deep in the Rockies , was killed Aug. 29 - his combat engineering unit 's first casualty since the Korean War . <p> So Mark missed Christmas , just as he missed Thanksgiving and his and Sherri 's fifth wedding anniversary . Just as he 'll miss the birthdays of his two young sons . <p> Sherri Lawton is a 36-year-old widow . <p> Her first holidays without Mark were filled with trepidation and devastating sadness . She also felt the warm sympathy of the man who sent Mark to battle . There were even moments of occasional laughter . <p> Her decision to join her family on these all-important days was a testament to her desire to move on for the sake of her children . Because , the truth is , she 'd rather just sit in the cemetery and talk to the grave . <p> ' I still do n't think that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mark was my whole world . ' <p> Family man <p> A difficult upbringing <p> precedes a military career . <p> Sherri and Mark Lawton met six years ago , soon after he returned to Craig , just down the road from Hayden , after a long career with the Marines . His faltering marriage had come to an end . <p> Mark , who grew up in a broken home , came to Colorado from Indiana at 16 to live with his father but ended up living in the garage of a friend 's home . He became a track and cross-country star , and joined the Army after graduation . <p> After two years , he switched to the Marines and fought in the first Persian Gulf War . When he left active duty and returned to Craig about six years ago , he drove a truck for a living . Then he went to work for a coal company . <p> After fathering a child outside of marriage in his 20s and watching his first two marriages fall apart , Mark was looking to start over as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . <p> The couple married a year after they met - on Sept. 12 , 1998 . <p> They held the ceremony outside Sherri 's home , by the pond . <p> It rained . It stormed . Rainwater drained through silk flowers gathered in an arch overhead and stained her white dress red . <p> Sherri laughs off this haunting image . <p> Someone said to her , ' I ca n't believe you are n't bawling your eyes out . ' <p> She answered : ' I came here to marry the person I love . It does n't matter what the rest of the day was like . I got my husband . ' <p> Dustin was born Aug. 12 , 1999 . On June 3 , 2002 , Tanner arrived . <p> Left behind <p> As the nation prepares for war , <p> Mark Lawton 's new life is put on hold . <p> To understand Sherri Lawton is to recognize that Staff Sgt. Mark Lawton was her hero . <p> And to understand the Mark Lawton she married is to recognize a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , country and family without question . <p> Even as a reservist , Mark instructed Sherri - against her fashion advice - to give him regulation Marine ' high-and- tight ' haircuts . <p> After Dustin was born , Mark joined the Reserves , to complete 20 years of service and earn the benefits he believed would help his new family . <p> Once a month , Mark took his family to Grand Junction , while he trained with the 244th Engineer Battalion . <p> Mark and Sherri did n't use babysitters . They were a family that believed in staying together . <p> After Sept. 11 , 2001 , Mark 's unit was put on alert . During the 2002 Christmas season , that meant girding for an invasion of Iraq . <p> The war veteran and his wife realized the unit and their families hardly knew one another . <p> ' This is crazy , ' Sherri remembers saying . ' We 've been in this unit three years , and no one really talks to anybody . ' <p> The unit 's leadership agreed , and encouraged Sherri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforming the engineering company 's Christmas party . <p> They would fill it with games and prizes and presents . Games that kids play , meant to force interaction . Pass an orange down the line from neck to neck . Clench a toothpick between your teeth and send along a Lifesaver . <p> Mark and Sherri had owned a small business , ' Sherri 's Ceramics and Such , ' before the boys came along . <p> Sherri spent hours painting 98 ceramic pieces to give to the reservists and their families . She and Mark ordered Army gear and trolled stores for domestic gifts . <p> The party was scheduled to begin at 3 or 4 in the afternoon , but then word came the soldiers were needed for a Christmas parade . <p> The party was moved to 7 in the morning . <p> Sherri worried it would be a disaster , and that all her work would be wasted . <p> ' Oh , man , people were furious that they had to be there at 7 , ' Sherri says , her deep green eyes suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be any fun . ' <p> But it worked . <p> ' They were still going at 3 o'clock that afternoon - and they knew they had to leave , ' Sherri says . ' They got to laughing at each other so hard that day , it really caused really good memories for them . ' <p> One night not long after the Christmas party , Mark made a comment about Iraq . <p> ' He did n't make a big deal about it , ' Sherri remembers . ' He just said , ' I just have a bad feeling that if we have to go this time , I wo n't come home . " <p> She breaks down crying at the memory . <p> When word came that his unit was to be deployed in February , Mark became all business . <p> " We knew it was coming , " she remembers him saying . " We 'll get it done . We 'll come home . " <p> For this war , Mark would be with a company of combat engineers . The 41- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staying , she believed , mostly out of the line of fire . <p> They had their minister order a New Testament small enough to fit in a breast pocket . Mark taped a picture of the family in the back and one of the wedding pictures Sherri made for him in the front . <p> In country <p> God 's hand is seen <p> in a series of coincidences . <p> On Aug. 29 , Mark was in Tikrit . If he followed his normal pattern , he awoke early , read the Bible , and looked at his family before hounding his troops to be punctual . His convoy was ready to go 15 minutes early , at a quarter to 8 . The medical and supply convoy that always rumbled past at 8 a.m. was now running 15 minutes late . <p> Mark 's colleagues believe the ambush they encountered was staged by Iraqi insurgents to get the supply convoy 's valuable commodities . Instead , they got Mark 's engineering battalion . <p> Before embarking , the staff sergeant did something highly irregular . He approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The captain 's habit was to ride in the lead Humvee , but he agreed to his subordinate 's request and swapped . <p> Next , Mark made another decision utterly unlike him . <p> A skilled operator of heavy machinery , Mark preferred to drive . <p> That morning , when offered the wheel , he declined , ' I drove a few days ago . I think it 's your turn to drive . ' <p> The convoy had been in transit about 45 minutes , when a pair of bullets punched through the windshield of the lead Humvee - a tight , snake-bite grouping . <p> One of them sliced through Mark 's throat . <p> Rocket-propelled grenades and small- arms fire struck others . A soldier lost his leg in the attack . He lived . <p> In a strange way , Sherri is comforted by the string of coincidences that put Mark in the bullet 's path that morning . The way she sees it , God chose Mark - not a random Iraqi assassin . <p> At the same time the ambush infuriates her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , ' a battle between soldiers , Mark would n't have died . <p> What seems to have been a sniper 's skill strikes her as the ultimate cheap shot . She does n't care that the U.S. also employs sharpshooters . <p> She got the news that afternoon from an Army chaplain who came to her home in Hayden . She knew what was coming from the moment she saw the government license tags on the silver van . <p> Her president 's comfort <p> Bush offers a hug , kind words . <p> It is a week before Thanksgiving , and Sherri is about to meet the president . <p> Bush is coming to Fort Carson to address the troops . He also is meeting privately with the families of the 31 troops deployed from the base who have died in Iraq since the war began . <p> Sherri is excited to face the man who decided to send her husband to war . <p> It 's an opportunity she refuses to miss - when she wakes with fever the next morning . <p> ' That man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother . ' I ca n't stay at home . ' <p> She and her mother , Carolyn Holloway , take turns at the wheel as they make the long drive from Hayden to Colorado Springs over snowy mountain passes . <p> Sherri has brought a quilt she made for Mark 's return . She hopes the president will autograph it . <p> She needs this . <p> When she wakes the next morning - the morning - the fever has lifted . She is fine . <p> She and Dustin and Tanner join Mark 's brother , Greg Evans , and sister , Vickie Owen . <p> At Fort Carson , Bush works his way around the room , visiting one on one . Reporters are n't allowed at the gathering , but , as Sherri recalls , there are times the president seems uncomfortable . Some family members refuse to shake his hand . They stand with their arms crossed tightly across their chests . <p> Others do make contact . He gives his autograph . <p> He comes to Mark 's family . He meets the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States turns to Sherri and opens his arms . <p> " Come here , " Sherri remembers him saying . " I 've got to give you a hug . " <p> He wraps his arms around her , and the two of them cry . <p> ' You have such an incredibly sad face , ' he tells her . ' My heart goes out to you . ' <p> Sherri is surprised - and pleased - to receive such attention . She asks about the quilt . The Army has hung it in the hallway . Bush says he 'll sign it , once he has completed his rounds . <p> Then Dustin tells him his father is dead . <p> Later , Bush signs the quilt Sherri made for Mark 's return , fabric filled with patriotic panels honoring the 244th Engineers . The United States . Freedom . <p> ' Oh , lady , you are breaking my heart , ' Bush tells her , embracing her again . <p> ' I do believe your president has fallen in love with you . ' <p> Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The presidential visit buoys Sherri , but by Wednesday she fears she can not go through with Thanksgiving . <p> Her boys are battling high fevers . She wants to bow out . <p> But she already is at her brother 's in Greeley , where the family is gathering . Always before it had been in Hayden , atop Cog Mountain , the family 's longtime home . <p> Sherri turns it over . <p> No . Mark would n't want her to stop living life , and Mark loved Thanksgiving . <p> So she tries . <p> Tammie Holloway , Sherri 's sister- in-law , is eight months ' pregnant , but she and her husband , Tony , Sherri 's little brother , work constantly , quietly , trying to juggle a houseful of little boys and Thanksgiving dinner so that Sherri does n't have to worry . <p> Carolyn and Sherri 's father , Lou Holloway , are alongside them in the kitchen , putting out appetizers , preparing side dishes . <p> Lou and Tony are cooking the turkey in a deep fryer this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears at her side . They hold her and whisper . <p> At dinner , they are thankful for their children , for each other , for God 's gracious gifts - for America . <p> Sherri tells her family at the dinner table she 's thankful she got to be with Mark as long as she did . <p> ' We only had six years , ' she says . ' We lived a lifetime . ' <p> The Army assigns ' casualty assistance officers ' to each primary survivor of a dead soldier . They help with everything from burial to re-entry into civilian society . <p> Sherri 's casualty assistance officer and assistant casualty assistance officer both have come for Thanksgiving , and brought their families , to be with Sherri on this trying day . <p> Sherri 's assistant casualty assistance officer , Sgt. Eric Williams , 35 , rejoined the Reserves last year . As a new member of the already deployed 244th Engineers , the carpenter was betting he would avoid combat duty . <p> Eric stood by the coffin . Helped fold the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped make sense of the paperwork . <p> Now , on Thanksgiving , Eric has to tell Sherri he is to be deployed - very likely for Iraq - on Dec. 7 , the anniversary of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor . <p> Sherri is visibly stunned by the news . <p> She holds Eric like she can not let him go . On her mind is that she no longer has faith that the troops come back . <p> ' I love you , ' she says , weeping . <p> Christmas <p> Nearly overwhelmed , a mother <p> presses on at Christmas . <p> Mark 's favorite holiday was Christmas , and Sherri is determined to see it through . <p> Two days before Christmas , she decorates a small tree at Tony and Tammie 's Greeley home . It 's red , white and blue . Placed next to the Nativity scene , it is a memorial to Mark . <p> On Christmas Eve , she sleeps on the floor with Dustin and Tanner and steels herself for the day . Dustin has become sensitive to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him but thinks it could be impossible to make it through . <p> Christmas morning finally comes . <p> When Dustin gets a tall , cylindrical gift , Sherri stops him from tearing into it . <p> ' Dear Dustin , ' Sherri 's card reads . ' Your daddy picked this out for you before he went to Iraq . ' <p> The family explains it until Dustin has grasped its importance . <p> ' My daddy picked it out a long time ago , ' Dustin says to them . <p> Sherri succeeds in holding back her tears . <p> But a little later , Sherri gets a gift from Mark 's mother . <p> It is a framed photo of Mark and his brother and sister . Mark wears the white cowboy hat Sherri bought him . <p> Sherri starts to cry , and then weep . Lou rushes to her side and holds her . Tony gets up and calls for a break and goes to his sister 's aid . Carolyn holds Tanner and wipes her eyes . <p> Sherri gains control , and Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boys return to opening packages . <p> Sherri sits impassively . It is as if she has had the air knocked out of her . She can not bring herself to move . <p> She tries to shake it off . She reaches for the present , and scratches at the wrapping paper . <p> She stops . <p> She touches the photo . <p> She gets up and steps outside . She closes the door behind her , and the family gives her space . <p> As they try to continue having Christmas , they can hear her weeping . Sobbing . <p> Dustin and Tanner have gotten lots of presents , from family and from outsiders , gifts from people in Hayden and Craig and in nearby Steamboat Springs , gifts from the military . It begins to look as if a toy store has been emptied into the room . <p> Tony and Tammie 's oldest boys seem to understand this , as if it 's been discussed . They do n't have nearly the number of presents that their cousins have collected - but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dustin acts out at times and tries to take gifts from the others . Lou has to take him aside to calm him . It is what Dustin does when he grows confused . It is part of a sudden new anger in him Sherri worries about . <p> Sherri returns to the living room and takes up her place in the armchair . <p> There are many more tearful moments this morning . Sherri gives Lou hunting gear she had bought for Mark . <p> She gives Tammie , who is due to have a daughter Jan. 6 , a dress she and Mark had for the daughter they hoped to try for once Mark returned . <p> But none of these moments so unnerves Sherri again . She remains strong . <p> She makes it through . <p> Her boys play giddily with their loot . <p> In a way that almost could go unrecognized , Sherri has acted heroically this day . She has been the hero she normally saw in the face of her husband . <p> ' It has to be done , ' Sherri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not want his boys to be without Christmas . ' <p> Flags <p> Visiting his grave - <p> but not living there . <p> Each day since Mark 's unit left for Iraq , Sherri has put a miniature American flag on the fence in front of her home . The ritual continues , even as the unit 's deployment has been extended several more months . <p> Any time she leaves the home , she stops first at Mark 's grave , just down the mountain from her house . She visits again every time she returns - and nearly each day in between . <p> It has been almost four months since Mark died . She has a long time ahead before she 'll be over this . <p> A week before Christmas , Sherri approaches the snow-covered grave and kneels before the Army-issued gray slab she keeps swept clean of snow and ice . <p> Looking at the snow-covered grave , she sees a country of sand . <p> She sees a shadowy figure holding a clearly defined rifle . She sees Mark slump over in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood onto the seat . <p> She struggles with an irrational guilt because she was n't there to hold her husband as he took his last breath . <p> Finally , she stands . She breathes deeply , and grows calm . <p> She looks to the west . The sun shines over the mountains . <p> " That 's where he loved to hunt . "
