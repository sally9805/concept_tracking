<p> PORTLAND , Ore . - Gretchen Schauffler wants American women to embrace corsets . Not the kind you 're probably thinking of . Schauffler , creator of the high-end Devine Color brand of interior house paints , plans to expand her $10 million annual business by introducing a line of custom window coverings she calls corsets : valances that hug the top of window frames and transform into full-length draperies by zipping on skirts of different hues and textures . Her approach to the product illustrates why Schauffler has transformed in a few years from stay-at-home suburban mom to a businesswoman whose products have national reach . To get a precise fit , she hired an apparel company to shape the window treatments - making the corset moniker more than just a marketing ploy . We decided to tailor the window with color , Schauffler says , predicting this corset will liberate women who tell her they have few good choices beyond lower-end , unlined window panels and fussy fabric-store treatments that do n't convey the modern look they crave . Style developed in Puerto Rico Schauffler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product or service from the ground up , she has prospered - and hopes to grow - through licensing deals with established companies . What she brings to the table is a color sense born of a childhood in Puerto Rico , a background in art and a craving for intense hues that comes from living in the rainy Northwest . She also has a savvy sense of how to appeal to women , who make most decorating decisions and who , Schauffler says , see their homes as sanctuaries from the pressures of daily life . This is what I believe in - color can make relationships between all things , making them appear perfect , no matter how new or old , Schauffler writes in a soon-to be released book . Since 2000 , Schauffler , whose core firm consists of three people , has had an exclusive agreement with Portland , Ore. - based Miller Paint to produce her Devine Color paint . Miller technicians developed a product that meets consistency and color guidelines set by Schauffler . Schauffler owns the brand ; Miller owns the product formulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position at the very premium end of the market . It was a designer line , and we launched at a price point 30% above our top-selling interior paint at that time , says Steve Dearborn , CEO of Miller Paint . In June , Schauffler will become a published author , releasing When Color Sings , a book about how to think about color . ( The book , published by Inkwater Press , is black and white text , with no illustrations , to get people to visualize color , rather than an illustrated how-to guide . ) She has hired a branding firm , Sandstrom Design , to work on possible deals for Devine hues and wants to design a line of custom carpets . Schauffler , who already has 25 affiliated color consultants , is trying to ramp up that part of her business through three-day training workshops in Portland , offered for a $595 fee . She is also trying to secure bricks-and-mortar locations in Manhattan and other select markets where Devine paint does n't yet have a have a retail presence . I align myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can execute what I have to give , Schauffler says . She also says no to marketing options that do n't convey the sophisticated sense she aims to project , such as branding a line of nail polish . Schauffler , a petite 44-year-old , manages to remain crisp and professional even when using words like yummy and sexy to describe her products . She got into her current business more by accident than design . After taking college courses in fashion , architecture and art , Schauffler graduated from Portland State University with a degree in graphic design . She worked as a sales rep for Bristol-Myers Squibb , quitting in the 1980s to stay at home with her daughters . When her suburban friends began paying for expensive faux finishes that Schauffler thought looked like badly bruised walls , she began her own faux finishing and color consulting business , for residential and corporate clients . She became frustrated wading through hundreds of commercial paint chips - only to pick a final color and have it look far different on the wall . She experimented with pigments and sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new product . In 2000 she signed the 25-year licensing deal with Miller Paint , in which she provides color consulting and promotion services and it does the chemistry and manufacturing . Treating the home holistically The philosophy of treating the home holistically is what has made the business so successful , Schauffler says . Everything I did was still back at ( the perspective of ) this suburban neighborhood , thinking , ' What are all these women looking for ? ' . Dearborn says Miller is now selling about 300,000 gallons of Devine Color a year . The paint is sold at 430 dealers throughout most of the USA and Canada , and another 45 to 50 in Ireland and the United Kingdom . Paint can also be ordered online . The line represents about 5% of overall Miller business , and 12% to 15% of its interior paint sales . We 're about where we anticipated being at this point ; we 're higher in the Northwest , Dearborn says . On the paint side , it 's really about getting in-home color consultations done , and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultants . Devine is priced around $37 a gallon , compared with $25 for many other paints . It carries a smaller palette of colors than most other lines . However , Schauffler plans to introduce revolving color lines featured for 18 months at a time . The first Pieces of Paradise will be tropical colors , influenced by her native Puerto Rico . Mini-paint pouches for sampling Devine is probably best known for one of Schauffler 's earliest marketing moves : a mini-paint pouch containing a sample large enough to cover an 18-square-inch area . Consumers can get four pouches for $16 , rather than buying an entire quart to try an individual color . Schauffler calls the mini-pouch 's success tactile as well as practical . There 's nothing yummier than playing with a liquid bag of paint that may burst , she says . Had we not had the ( quality of the ) paint to back it up this would have been nothing . Further , rather than preprinted paint chips , Devine produces a sample book made up of daubs of paint so customers can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $23 - it 's a break-even product . ) Devine is displayed in paint , home decorating and other specialty stores in a case that looks like a piece of cherry wood furniture . Karlyn Gedrose , a partner in Griffin and Gedrose Interior Design in Portland , specs Devine paint for many of her clients . ( Schauffler 's ) picked out paints that go together well and really work with the lack of sunshine here in the Northwest , Gedrose says . But Gedrose adds that the limited palate means she does n't use the line exclusively , saying she does n't think Devine has enough whites or off-whites and , like other paint firms , not enough reds . She has heard Schauffler speak and seen the results of some of her color consulting jobs . She 's probably a little more bold than I would be . I would n't say that 's good or bad , it 's just a difference in design , Gedrose says . Linda Weston , president and executive director of the Oregon Entrepreneurs Forum , says another of Schauffler 's key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a good reputation in the Northwest . Still , Devine does n't have a retail presence in some top markets . That reflects both Schauffler 's decision not to sell in big-box stores and the fact that many smaller paint stores see the product as competition . While Schauffler hopes to expand her color-consulting business , only three of the 13 students in her first color-consulting class received approval . Devine does limited production , making only paint pouches and the paint sample book in-house at a warehouse space ( painted a custom lime green that looks cheerful in rainy Oregon ) . Asked the key to her success , Schauffler pauses for a minute , then says : To not take ' no ' for an answer . To just get out of bed , and say that I 'm right . To always see myself as the person who wants this for themselves . <p> TEXT OF BIO BOX BEGINS HERE About Gretchen Schauffler Born : San Juan , Puerto Rico Age : 44 Education : Graphic design , Portland State University About Devine Color Headquarters : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Description : Produces high-end brand of paints and does color consulting .
