OK , children , gather around . I 'll tell you what life was like before parish councils , back when my hair was brown and my dreams were green . The pastor pretty much ran things , and that was fine with most of us . First of all , we did n't have to go to a lot of boring meetings . Second , we were free to complain to one another ( and sometimes to him ) about what was wrong with the parish without feeling one iota of guilt or responsibility . Finally , we did n't have to go to a lot of boring meetings . Then along came Vatican II and we realized that : * The church is " the people of God . " * We laypeople have a lot of talent and knowledge parishes desperately need . * Priests and other parish staff people are n't especially trained or sometimes even very good at a lot of the things that go into running a parish . * If we laypeople were more involved in decisions about the parish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God said , " Let there be parish councils , " and there were parish councils . And God saw that it was good . Well , actually , as far as we know God has not expressed a definitive position one way or another on parish councils , but the pope thinks they 're a good idea , and that should be enough for most of us . Now , I come to praise parish councils , not bury them , though I 'm not a big fan of them as presendy constituted . It seems to me that most fall into one of three categories : * Rubber stamps for the pastor and staff . * A soapbox for complainers and obfuscators of all things parish . * A particularly cruel and unusual form of punishment for certain well-intentioned parishioners . In all of the above cases , serving on a parish council seems like a waste of a good layperson 's precious time . But that does n't mean we should bury them . It means we should figure out how to make them operate better - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a matter of changing the structure . At one parish I know , for example , the parish council was clearly not working , so the staff and lay leaders spent a year discerning what was wrong and how to fix it . After considerable study and consultation they decided that since the parish council was n't working , what was needed was to get the key people on every single one of the 70 or so parish ministries involved in the working of the council . The parish developed four " commissions , " made up of representatives of all of the ministries , which were each to meet four times a year and report their activities to the council . This meant that all the busiest people in the parish ( including the parish staff , who were to attend each of the commission meetings ) would now be required to go to at least four additional meetings per year . Sure enough , after a couple of years the quarterly commission meetings have pretty much turned into poorly attended times for exchanging information and working out scheduling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish council still does n't work . As a businessman and former community organizer , I 've tried to convince various parish councils that one of the problems they have is that they waste people 's time . As in most good businesses and organizations : * Meetings should start on time . * A printed agenda should be sent out ahead of time . * People should be prepared to present and speak to the issues on the agenda . * Issues should be discussed and decided by majority vote . * The meeting should end on time or early - never late . Everyone thinks these are good ideas - in theory . In practice , however , parish council meetings usually start late , waiting for stragglers to arrive , and then continue on until all hours of the night , trying to come to something called " consensus " on every issue . This makes it difficult for members to explain to their spouses why they are home so late or to their bosses why they are sleepy the next day at work . It also makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So why do I say that I have come to praise parish councils ? I have come to praise the idea of parish councils - that is , a group of laypeople who can advise the pastor and parish staff on the key mission and function of the church . You know what that mission is , do n't you ? It is the mission on which all Catholics are sent at the end of every Mass . It is the mission on which Jesus of Nazareth sent his disciples and by extension all of us . It is the mission to help bring about the Kingdom of God " on earth as it is in heaven . " It is a mission worthy of all of our lives - and certainly one worthy of our spending a few hours a month sitting on a parish council if it can help us and our fellow parishioners better accomplish it . Here is what we laypeople need to ask of the parish : * Are the various ministries , spiritual practices , and religious education programs offered by our parish helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives ? * Do the homilies we hear help us connect scriptures with our mission to the world ? * Does the Mass send us forth with a sense of urgency and empowerment to " love and serve the Lord " and transform the world ? On these questions our pastors and parish staff can certainly use our feedback , and the parish council can be the place where we laypeople can give it . Likewise with the functioning of the parish itself . A parish council can advise the pastor and staff on parish programs , finances , fundraising , facility management , personnel , and so forth . Not that we are going to do these things for them . They are still in charge , and we are merely advising . That 's just the way it is , and we really should n't want it any other way . Otherwise our work on the parish council could distract us from our work on our jobs , with our families , and in civic affairs . This is what the parish council should be all about : making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the Christian mission to the world . Almost by definition , then , it will not be a rubber stamp for the pastor and staff , nor a place where naysayers come together to complain about internal parish issues , nor a waste of time for those who serve on it . Why ? Because it will be dealing with what we laypeople really care about : our lives outside church , not what happens inside church . The purpose of the parish council is to help the parish better prepare us and send us forth into the world . Why would we ever think it was for anything else ?
