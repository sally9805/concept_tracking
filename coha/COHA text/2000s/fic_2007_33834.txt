Chapter One It all started with a coincidence . Not one of those totally creepy coincidences that make you feel as if someone has just walked across your grave . In fact , later I could see that the phone call I got that late summer night was n't all that unexpected-but at the time it made me catch my breath . And , of course , it was the start of everything horrible that happened .... I 'd decided to stop by the office that day , something I rarely do on Tuesdays . It was crazy hot for the middle of September , and it would have been nice to just hang on the brick terrace of my apartment in Greenwich Village , chugging a few iced teas . But a new deputy editor had started recently-Valerie Crowe , a hyper , edgy chick who left you overwhelmed with an urge to shoot a tranquilizer dart into her ass-and I thought it would be smart to give her some face time . My copy goes through the executive editor , but it 's one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often suggests leads for me to follow up on . Since Tuesday is the day after closing , I knew she 'd probably have a few minutes to spare . Most of the staff never even gets in before noon that day . My name is Bailey Weggins , and I 'm a reporter for Buzz , one of the weekly celebrity gossip magazines that have become like crack cocaine for women under thirty-five these days . Unlike most of the staff , Ido n't cover the botched marriages and bulimic ordeals of the stars . Instead , I report on celebrity crime-like when an A-lister hurls a phone at a hotel desk clerk or hires a hit man to shoot his wife . It 's not something I 'd ever imagined myself doing . I was a straight crime writer for the ten years after college graduation , but when the job opened up early in the summer , curiosity and the need for a regular gig prodded me to take it . " Celebrity crime reporter-are you saying it 's some sort of specialized area of journalism ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were on a par with becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon or astrophysicist . Initially , I was at a disadvantage because I did n't know-excuse the expression-jackshit about celebrities . Oh , I 'd picked up tidbits about the really major stars-you know , like Brad and Angelina and Gwyneth and TomKat-from listening to friends dish as well as perusing gossip magazines during pedicures . But I was clueless about most of the other stars in the celebrity universe . In fact , until two weeks into my job at Buzz , I 'd thought Jake Gyllenhaal and Orlando Bloom were the same person . But I caught on pretty quickly , and to my surprise , I grew to really enjoy my two-to-three-day-a-week arrangement . Celebrities not only live large , they misbehave large , too . Covering their crimes , I discovered , could be awfully entertaining . One more plus . In November , a small publishing house was releasing a collection of my crime pieces , Bad Men and Wicked Women , and the job would be leverage for PR . The Buzz offices were practically tomblike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercifully cool , as if the low body count had prevented the air from rising above 65 degrees that day . I nodded to a few people as I walked through the huge cube farm/bullpen that constitutes a major chunk of our offices . I 'm in a part of that area nicknamed the Pod , which abuts the art and production departments and houses many of the writers and junior editors . The senior editors are in glass-fronted offices that rim the area . My workstation is right next to that of a senior writer named Jessie Pendergrass and behind Leo Zern , a photo editor they could n't find room for in the photo department . " Hey , " I said to Leo as I tossed my purse and tote bag onto my desk . He was the only one in the general vicinity . He tore his eyes off his computer screen and swiveled just his head in my direction . " To what do we owe this honor ? " he asked . " I thought you were n't coming in today . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jessie around ? " " She 's not in yet . I heard her tell someone on the phone yesterday that her bikini line was a disaster , so maybe she 's having it administered to . " " Anything going on here ? " " Not really . Oh , there was a little bit of a dustup this morning . You know how we said Britney Spears looked like a Smurf ? " " No . Okay , I 'll take your word for it . " " Nash got a phone call today , and the fur was flying . " He was talking about Nash Nolan , the editor in chief . " From Britney 's publicist ? " " No , it was from a Smurf representative . They do n't want to be compared to her . " " Very funny . So what are you working on ? " I sidled over to his desk and checked out the computer screen . There was a grainy shot of a blond starlet type I did n't recognize sitting at an outdoor restaurant , jamming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were stuffing dirty clothes into an overfilled hamper . " God , the paparazzi do n't let these chicks alone , do they , " I said . " The ones who take these shots do n't consider themselves paparazzi , " he said . " They 're snackarazzi . " " You 're kidding , right ? " " Not at all . These are the real money shots these days . They 're almost as good as one of a star scratching her ass . " " Remind me not to order a double bacon cheeseburger the next time I 'm at a sidewalk caf . " " I think you 're safe , Bailey , " he said , smirking . I checked my e-mail and then a bunch of Web sites to see if any A-listers had landed themselves in hot water that day , but things seemed fairly quiet . After grabbing a cup of coffee , I wandered down to the office of the new deputy editor . " Hi , Val , " I said , poking my head in the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at office politics , but fawning and bullshitting just do n't come easily to me , particularly if the person at the other end is a real jerk , which I suspected Valerie was . A guy I used to work with at the Albany Times Union , when I was a newspaper reporter right out of college , said that I butt-kissed about as well as a blowtorch . " What can I do for you ? " Valerie asked without enthusiasm . Her dark hair was slicked off her face today , accentuating the large sharp nose she sported between brown eyes . She reminded me of how our family dog used to look when he emerged sopping wet from a pond . " Just thought I 'd check in-see if you needed me for anything , " I told her . " What are you working on now ? " she asked , a thin layer of impatience coating her question . Gosh , I thought , you just do n't like me , do you ? But I could n't tell why . She 'd arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief , Mona Hodges , had been killed in her office by several blows to the head . It had been a tumultuous time , particularly for me , for not only had I found Mona that night , but I also had later figured out who had murdered her , nearly getting killed myself in the process . Nash , the number two at the time , had been named editor in chief shortly afterward ; a deputy editor had taken over for Nash , and now Valerie had the deputy job . I sometimes wondered if she resented the fact that Nash and I were tight and that I had plenty of autonomy . " Nothing major at the moment , " I told her . " Just following a few leads . I probably wo n't come in again this week unless something breaks . " " Just let Aubrey know , " she said , referring to the managing editor . Then she glanced over at her computer screen as if she were dying to get back to work . " Sure , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the subway up from the Village . As long as I was at the office , I followed up with staffers on a few matters and polished off another cup of coffee . And then , with nothing more to do , I stood up to go . " Oh , Bailey , I know what your favorite TV show is going to be this season , " Leo said as I was shutting off my computer . " Have you seen the fall lineup ? " " No , but let me guess . Survivor-The New York Singles Scene ? " " Nope . A new show called Morgue . It 's about investigators from the medical examiner 's office . Sounds perfect for someone with your grisly interests . " " Are n't there a million shows like that already ? " I asked . " I guess the public ca n't get enough of them . " Just to humor Leo , I sauntered over to his desk and glanced down at his computer screen . Along with the description of the show , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ensemble cast , all perfectly coiffed and smileless , their eyes burning with desire to see justice done and have the show win its time slot in the ratings . Suddenly I felt my jaw drop . One of the actors I was staring at in the ensemble cast was Chris Wickersham . He was a model and actor I 'd had a short fling with last winter . " Oh , wow , " I said . " What-you think you 're really gon na like it ? " " No , the guy on the far left . I know him . " " Really ? " he said as he glanced back at the screen . " You mean-Chris Wickersham , who plays Jared Hanson , the sometimes moody but brilliantly intuitive investigator ? Is he straight ? " " Very . It says it 's about the New York City Morgue . Does that mean it 's shooting here ? " " Not necessarily . Lemme see ... Yes , shot entirely in New York City . Was this guy your boyfriend ? " " Sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? " " No , just that it premieres in two weeks . " " Look , I 'd better fly . Tell Jessie hi for me , will you ? " I grabbed my purse and tote bag and headed out of the building . My mind was racing , thinking of what I 'd just learned about Chris . The last time I had laid eyes on him was right before he 'd struck out for L.A. last March , hoping like millions of other guys with dreamy eyes and perfect jawlines to be cast in a pilot for the fall . We had n't promised each other anything about staying in touch ( though early on he 'd sent two e-mails and one goofy postcard of the Hollywood sign ) , and I 'd just assumed he had n't met with any real success yet . But he had . And based on the public love of carnage and corpses , there was every chance the show would be a success . I felt happy for Chris ; he deserved fame and fortune . But at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing that I could n't put my finger on . Maybe it was knowing that a guy I 'd locked lips with was now poised to become the kind of hottie women across America drooled over and dished about the next day at the watercooler . I took the subway to 8th and Broadway , hit the gym for thirty minutes , grabbed a few supplies at the deli , and then headed to my apartment at 9th and Broadway . Though I 'd left home only a few hours earlier , my place was stifling hot . I turned on the AC , fixed an ice water , and flopped on the couch . As I took the first sip of my drink , I let memories of Chris Wickersham run roughshod around my brain . I had met him a year ago April , at a wedding , where he had worked as one of the bartenders , supplementing the money he made from modeling and small acting gigs . He was absolutely gorgeous , the kind of guy it almost hurt to look at . Though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off . He was ten years younger than me , and though that kind of age gap had n't bothered Cameron Diaz or Demi Moore , I just could n't imagine having a boyfriend I was old enough to have baby-sat for . Then , nine months later , we 'd reconnected when I 'd needed his help during a murder investigation . I was dating a guy named Jack steadily by then , and I tried not to send any of the wrong messages to Chris , but one night he had kissed me and I 'd felt it all the way to my tippy toes . It was the beginning of my doubts about my relationship with Jack . Soon afterward I was single again . Chris and I had a few dates and some serious make-out sessions , but I 'd been unable to take the relationship-sexually and otherwise-beyond that . One of the last things Chris had said to me was , " Jeez , Bailey , what is it with you-yes or no ? " In the end , it had been no . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guilt . I always associated Chris with my breakup . If I met him today , would I still feel those doubts ? I wondered . What would it be like to date a guy millions of people watched on TV ? Christ , Bailey , I thought , you 're starting to sound like a star fucker . I drained the last of my water . I 'd planned to stay in tonight to work on a freelance article . Plus , ever since I 'd had my heart bruised during the summer by a guy named Beau Regan , I 'd been lying low . But thanks to the heat wave , the idea now held nada appeal . I wondered who I might be able to drum up for companionship on short notice . My seventy-year-old next-door neighbor , Landon , who I sometimes palled around with , had said he was heading over to the Film Forum on West Houston Street to see a German flick . A college pal of mine from Brown had recently split with her husband , and she was game for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening in her company could be exhausting . She tended to ask an endless series of borderline-hostile questions that were impossible for me to answer-like " Are all men dickheads or just the ones I meet ? " " Who would drink a prickly pear martini , do you know ? " and " Do you think I 'm brimming with anger ? " Maybe I would just head out alone and eat a quiet dinner outdoors at one of the restaurants over on MacDougal . As I padded toward my bedroom to change , my cell phone buzzed from my purse , making me jump . " Hello , " I said after digging it out . " Bailey ? " " Yes . " " Hi , it 's Chris Wickersham . " For a moment , I thought it was Leo playing a practical joke . But he would n't have been familiar with that deep , smooth voice-so I knew for certain it had to be Chris . I caught my breath , stunned by the eeriness of the timing . " Oh , my gosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two hours ago . Congratulations-I , er , heard about the show . " God , Bailey , this is why you write professionally , I thought . You should n't be allowed to open your mouth . " Thanks , " he said . " The opportunity kind of came out of nowhere . I 've been planning to call you-I mean , just to say hello . " " So you 're back in New York ? " " Yeah-I 've got a studio in TriBeCa . I do n't want to overextend myself until I know if the show is going to take off or not . " " Is the shooting schedule as brutal as you hear ? " " Fourteen-hour days , sometimes . But this is what I wanted , and I 've got no complaints . The show kicks off in a couple of weeks , and then we play the ratings game . " " It sounds like a super idea for a show-I 'm sure it will be a hit . " " Kind of your type of show , huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that today . " " Well , look , the reason I called ... I mean , I wanted to say hi , but-is there any chance you could meet me for a drink ? There 's something I need to talk to you about . " " Sure , " I said . His tone did n't suggest a man who 'd been pining for me for months and had decided to make one last stab at winning my heart , but I was still curious . " When were you thinking ? " " I know this is short notice , but I was wondering if you could do it now . It 's really pretty urgent . You 're the one person I can turn to on this . " " What is it ? Are you in some kind of trouble ? " " No , no . But a friend of mine may be . I need your advice . " " Can you give me a hint ? " I asked , though I figured that if a guy he knew was in trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It-Look , would you mind talking about it in person ? I hate the idea of starting to get into it on the phone and then having to cover the same ground again when we meet . " " Well , I could do it now , actually , " I admitted . " I was planning to stay in and work tonight , but it can wait . " " That 's terrific , " he said . He suggested we meet in an hour and asked me to recommend a place near me . I threw out the name of a bar on Second Avenue between 9th and 10th . It would take me less than five minutes to walk there . After signing off , I walked distractedly into the bathroom and splashed cool water on my face and in my armpits . I could n't believe what had just happened . Maybe it was my destiny that Chris Wickersham would pop into my life every nine months or so . I wondered if there was any chance that he was using a so-called problem with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been hard to tell on the phone . And I was n't at all sure how I 'd feel when I saw him . I had never once stopped finding him staggeringly attractive . Perhaps now that I was no longer guilt stricken-and my love life was currently in the Dumpster with a capital D-I would feel the urge to go for it this time . (
