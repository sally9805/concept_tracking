1 Leaves " I 'm ten years old , my whole life you 've called me Vanya . My name is on the school records , on government papers as Ivan Petrovich Smetski . Now you tell me I 'm really Itzak Shlomo . What am I , a Jewish secret agent ? " Vanya 's father listened silently , his face as smooth , weathered , and blank as parchment . Vanya 's mother , who was merely hovering near the conversation rather than taking part in it , seemed to be having a little trouble keeping herself from smiling . In amusement ? If so , at what ? At Vanya ? At her husband 's sudden discovery of their intense commitment to Judaism ? Whatever the cause of her almost-smile , Vanya did not want to be ridiculous . Even at the age of ten , dignity was important to him . He calmed himself , spoke in more measured tones . " We eat pork , " he pointed out . " Rak . Caviar . " " I think Jews can eat caviar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them whispering , calling me zhid , they say they only want to race with Russians , I ca n't even run with them , " said Vanya . " I 've always been the fastest runner , the best hurdler , and yesterday they would n't even let me keep time . And it 's my stopwatch ! " " Mine , actually , " said Father . " The principal wo n't let me sit in class with the other children because I 'm not a Russian or a Ukrainian , I 'm a disloyal foreigner , a Jew . So why do n't I know how to speak Hebrew ? You change everything else , why not that ? " Father looked up toward the ceiling . " What is that look , Father ? Prayer ? All these years , whenever I talk too much , you look at the ceiling  --  were you talking to God then ? " Father turned his gaze to Vanya . His eyes were heavy  --  scholar 's eyes , baggy and soft from always peering through lenses at a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " he said . " Ten years old , a boy who thinks he 's so brilliant , he rails on and on , showing no respect for his father , no trust . I do it all for your sake . " " And for God 's , " offered Mother . Was she being ironic ? Vanya had never been able to guess about Mother . " For you I do this , " said Father . " You think I did it for me ? My work is here in Russia , the old manuscripts . What I need from other countries is sent to me because of the respect I 've earned . I make a good living . " " Made , " said Mother . For the first time it occurred to Vanya that if he was cut out of school classes , Father 's punishment might be even more dire . " You lost your place at the university ? " Father shrugged . " My students will still come to me . " " If they can find you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find me ! Or not ! " cried Father . " We 'll eat or not ! But we will get Vanya  --  Itzak  --  out of this country so he grows up in a place where this mouth of his , this disrespect for everyone that does n't measure up to his lofty standards , where they will call it creativity or cleverness or rock and roll ! " " Rock and roll is music , " said Vanya . " Prokofiev is music , Stravinski is music , Tchaikovski and Borodin and Rimski-Korsakov and even Rachmaninov , they are music . Rock and roll is smart boys with no respect , you are rock and roll . All the trouble you get into at school , you will never get into university with this attitude . Why are you the only child in Russia who does n't learn to bow his head to power ? " Father had asked this question at least a dozen times before , and this time as always , Vanya knew that his father was saying it more in pride than in consternation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He encouraged it . So how did this become the reason for the family to declare itself Jewish and apply for a visa to Israel ? " You make a decision without asking me , and it 's my fault ? " " I have to get you out of here , let you grow up in a free land , " said Father . " Israel is a land of war and terrorism , " said Vanya . " They 'll make me a soldier and I 'll have to shoot down Palestinians and burn their houses . " " None of that propaganda is true , " said Father . " And besides , it wo n't matter . I can promise you that you will never be a soldier of Israel . " Vanya was scornful for a moment , until it dawned on him why Father was so certain he would n't be drafted into the Israeli military . " Once you get out of Russia , you are n't going to Israel at all . " Father sighed . " What you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock at the door . Mother went to answer . " Maybe here in Russia you are n't in class for a while , " said Father . " And this nonsense of running , you 'll never be world champion , that 's for Africans . But your mind will be quick long after your legs slow down , and there are countries where you will be valued . " " Which other countries ? " asked Vanya . Mother was letting somebody into the apartment . " Maybe Germany . Maybe England . Canada , maybe . " " America , " whispered Vanya . " How do I know ? It depends where there 's a university that wants an aging scholar of ancient Slavic literature . " America . The enemy . The rival . The land of jeans and rock and roll , of crime and capitalism , of poverty and oppression . Of hope and freedom . All kinds of stories about America , from rumor , from the government press . It was 1975 and the Vietnam War had ended only a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propaganda , the rivalry , the envy , one message was constant : America was the most important country on earth . And that 's where Father wanted him to grow up . That 's why Mother 's Jewish relatives were suddenly the only ones who counted , they and Father 's grandmother on his mother 's side . To get them to America . For a moment , Vanya almost understood . Then Mother came back into the room . " He 's here . " " Who 's here ? " asked Vanya . Father and Mother looked at him blankly . " He 's called a moyle , " said Mother finally . Then they explained what this old Jewish man was going to do to Vanya 's penis . Ten seconds later , Vanya was down the stairs , out on the street , running for his life , running in despair . He was not going to let a man take hold of his member and cut bits of it off just so he could get on a plane and fly to the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moyle was gone , and his parents said nothing about his abrupt departure . He took no false hope from this . In Vanya 's family , silence had never meant surrender , only tactical retreat . Even without the moyle , though , Vanya continued to take solace in running . Isolated at school , resentful at home , cut off from romping with his friends , he took to the streets again and again , day after day , running , dodging , leaving behind him ever-grumpier mutters and shouts of Slow down ! Watch your step ! Show some respect ! Crazy boy ! To Vanya that was part of the music of the city . Running was the way he dreamed . Having never been in control of his own life , his idea of freedom was simply to break free . He dreamed of being at the mercy of the wind , carried aloft and blown here and there , a life of true randomness instead of always being part of someone else 's purpose . Father 's earnest , inconvenient plans for him . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the midst of which you did what was needed . What I need , Mother , is to kite myself up in the air and cut the string and fly untethered . What I need , Father , when you 're setting out the pieces for your living chess game , is to be left in the box . Forget me ! But running could n't save him from anyone 's plans , in the end . Nor did it bring him freedom , for his parents , as always , took his little idiosyncrasies in stride . In fact they made it part of their story ; he overheard them telling some of their new Jewish friends that they had to be patient with Itzak , he was between realities , having had the old one stolen from him and not yet ready to enter the new one . How did they think of these glib little encapsulations of his life ? Only when Father underwent the male ritual of obedience himself did Vanya realize that this Jewish business was not just something they were doing to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could not ; though he said nothing , his pain and embarrassment at showing it made him almost silent . Mother , ever supportive , said nothing even to refer to what the moyle had done to her husband , but Vanya thought he detected a slight smirk on her face when Father asked her to fetch him something that ordinarily he would get up and find for himself . He wondered briefly if this meant that Mother thought the whole enterprise of believing in God was amusing , but as Father 's wound healed and life returned to what passed for normal these days , Vanya began to suspect that , despite her irony , it was Mother who was a believer . Perhaps she had been a believer all along , despite slathering the tangy , bacony lard on her bread like any other Russian . Father 's discovery of his Jewishness was part of an overall strategy ; Mother simply knew who ran the universe . Father was forcing himself to act like a believer . Mother showed not a doubt that God really existed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six million Jews died from the Fascists , " she said to Father . " Your one voice , praying , is going to fill all that silence ? When a child dies , do you comfort the parents by bringing them a puppy to take care of ? " Mother apparently believed not only in the idea of God , but also that he was the very same God who chose the Jews back when it was just Abraham carting his barren wife around with him , pretending she was his sister whenever some powerful man lusted after her . That was a favorite story for Vanya , as Father insisted that they study Torah together , going over to the apartment of a rabbi and hearing him read the Hebrew and translate . As they walked home , they would talk about what they 'd heard . " These guys are religious ? " Vanya kept asking . " Judah sleeps with a prostitute on the road , only it turns out to be his daughter-in-law so it 's all right with God ? " The story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the daughter of Jacob , gets raped by the prince of Shechem . The prince wants to marry her and Jacob agrees that this would make everything all right , only Dinah 's twelve brothers are more interested in repairing the family 's wounded honor than in getting their sister married to a rich man with a throne in his future . So they tell the prince that he and all the men of his city have to be circumcised , and when the men are all lying there holding their handles and saying Ow , ow , ow , the sons of Jacob draw their swords and slaughter them all . At the end of that story , Vanya said to his father , " Maybe I 'll let the moyle do it to me . " Father looked at him in utter consternation . " That story makes you want to be circumcised ? " Vanya shrugged . " Is there any hope that you can explain to me why this makes sense ? " " I 'm thinking about it , that 's all , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . Before the story he refused even to think about it ; after the story , it became conceivable to him , and , once he could conceive of it , it soon became inevitable . Later , running , he thought maybe he understood why that story changed his mind . Circumcision was a foolish , barbaric thing to do . But having the story of Shechem in Torah showed that God himself knew this . It 's barbaric , God seemed to be saying , and it hurts like hell , but I want you to do it . Make yourself weak , so somebody could come in and kill you and you 'd just say , Thank you , I do n't want to live anyway because somebody cut off part of my privates . He could n't explain this to his father . He just knew that as long as God recognized that it was a ludicrous thing to do , he could do it . So for a few days Vanya did n't run . And it turned out that by the time the circumcision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city out from under him . The American Congress had antagonized the Russian government by tying most-favored-nation status to Russia 's upping the number of Jews getting visas , and in reply the Russians cut the emigration of Jews down to nothing and started harassing them more . To Vanya 's family , this had very practical consequences . They lost their apartment . For Father , it meant no more consultations with students , no more visits with his former colleagues at the university . It meant the shame of being utterly dependent on others for food and clothing for his family , for there was no job he could get . Mother took it all in stride . " So we make bricks without straw , " she said . All his life Vanya remembered her making enigmatic comments like that . Only now he was reading Exodus and he got the reference and realized : Mother really is a Jew ! She 's been talking to us as if we were all Jews my whole life , only I did n't get it . And for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be her plan , only she was so good at it that she had gotten Father to think of it himself , for his own very logical , unreligious reasons . Do n't become a practicing Jew because God commands it , become one so you can get your son a good life in America . Could she possibly be that sneaky ? For a week , they camped in the homes of several Jews who had no room for them . It could n't last for long , this life , partly because the crowding was so uncomfortable , and partly because it was so obvious that , compared to these lifelong followers of the Law , Vanya and his parents were dilettantes at Judaism . Father and Vanya hacked at Hebrew , struggled to keep up with the prayers , and looked blankly a hundred times a day when words and phrases were said that meant nothing to them . Mother seemed untroubled by such problems , since she had lived for a couple of years with her mother 's parents , who kept all the holidays , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men . Yet Vanya saw that she , too , seemed more amused than involved in the life of these homes , and the women of these households seemed even more wary of her than the men were of Father . Finally it was n't a Jew at all , but a second cousin ( grandson of Father 's grandfather 's brother , as they painstakingly explained to Vanya ) , who took them in for the potentially long wait for an exit visa . Cousin Marek had a dairy farm in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains , in a region that had been part of Poland between the wars , and so escaped Stalin 's savage collectivization of the freehold farmers of Ukraine . Because this hill country was remote , strategically unimportant , and thinly populated , Communism here was mostly window dressing . Technically Cousin Marek 's dairy herd was merely a portion of the herd belonging to the farflung dairy collective ; in actual practice , they were his cows , to be bred and cared for as he wished . A good portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way into the state-run dairy system . Instead , it was bartered here and there for goods and services , and now and then for hard Western currency . Cousin Marek had the room , the independent attitude , and enough surplus to take in a few hapless cousins who had decided to become Jews in order to get to the West . " The country life will be good for you , Vanya , " said Father , though the sour expression on his face suggested that he had not yet thought of a way that the country life would be good for him . What Cousin Marek did not have was a university within three hours ' travel . If Father was to lecture , he 'd have to find a subject matter interesting to cows . As for Vanya , though , Father was right . The country life was good for him . The chores were hard , for though Cousin Marek was a pleasant man , he nevertheless expected that everyone on the farm would work every day , and give full measure . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention the country food , the whole milk , the coarser , crustier , more floury bread they made in this part of Ukraine . The farm was good ; but what he came to love lay beyond the farm . For in this backwater , some remnant of the old forests of Europe still survived . " This is the rodina , the original homeland , " Father told him . " Where the old Slavs hid while the Goths passed through , and the Huns . And then they were gone and we fanned out into the plain and left these hills to the wolves and bears . " Our land . Father still thought like a Russian , not like a Jew . What did Vanya care , at his age , about the original Russia ? All he knew was that the country roads went on forever without traffic , and with grass growing where the wheels did n't make their ruts ; and the trees grew large and ancient in the steep-sided hollows of the hills where no one had bothered to cut them down ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above honking cars and roaring engines . Someone had spilled a milkpail of stars across the sky , and at night when there was no moon it was so dark you could bump into walls just trying to find the door of the house . It was n't really wild country , but to Vanya , a city boy , an apartment dweller , it was a place of magic and dreams , like the paintings of Shishkin ; Vanya half-expected to see bear cubs in the trees . This was the place where all the fairy tales of his childhood must have taken place  --  the land of Prince Ivan , the grey wolf , the firebird ; of Koshchei the Deathless , of Mikola Mozhaiski , of Baba Yaga the witch . And , because he came here about the same time as his first reading of Torah , he also pictured the wanderings of Abraham and Jacob and the children of Israel in this green place . He knew it was absurd  --  Palestine was hot and dry , the Sinai was stone and sand . But could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herding sheep in these hills , to show their father the torn and bloody many-colored coat ? Was n't it from these hills that Abraham charged forth to do battle for the cities of the plain ? He could n't fly here , either , but he could run until he was so exhausted and lightheaded that it felt as if he had flown . And then he grew bolder , and left the roads and tracks , searching for the most ancient and lost parts of the forest . Hours he 'd be gone , exploring , until Mother grew worried . " You fall down a slope , you break your leg , nobody knows where you are , you die out there alone , is that your plan ? " But Father and Mother must have discussed it together and decided to trust in his good sense and perhaps in the watchfulness of God , for they continued to allow him his freedom . Maybe they were simply counting on the visa to come and get him back to some American city where they could hide in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they always heard about . If the visa had come one day earlier , Vanya would n't have found the clearing , the lake of leaves . He came upon it in the midst of a forest so old that there was little underbrush  --  the canopy of leaves overhead was so dense that it was perpetually dusk at ground level , and nothing but a few hardy grasses and vines could thrive . So it felt as if you could see forever between the tree trunks , until finally enough trunks blocked the way or it grew dark and murky enough that you could no longer see beyond . The ground was carpeted with leaves so thick that it made the forest floor almost like a trampoline . Vanya began loping along just to enjoy the bouncy feel of the ground . Like walking on the moon , if the Americans really had landed there . Leap , bounce , leap , bounce . Of course , on the moon there were no tree limbs , and when Vanya banged his head into one , it knocked him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mother warned me about . I 'll get a concussion , I 'll fall down in convulsions , and my body wo n't be found until a dog drags some part of me onto somebody 's farm . Probably the circumcised part of me , and they 'll have to call in a moyle to identify it . Definitely the boy Itzak Shlomo  --  on your records as Ivan Petrovich Smetski . A good runner , but apparently not bright enough to look out for trees . Sorry , but he was too stupid to go on living . That 's just the way natural selection works . And Father would shake his head and say , He should have been in Israel , where there are no trees . After a while , though , his head cleared , and he went back to bounding through the forest . Now , though , he looked up , scouting for low limbs , and that 's how he realized he had found a clearing  --  not because of the bright sunlight that made the place a sudden island of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly there were no more branches . He stopped short at the edge of the clearing and looked around . Should n't it be a meadow here , where the sun could shine ? Tall grass and wildflowers , that 's what it should be . But instead it was just like the forest floor , dead leaves thickly carpeting the undulating surface of the clearing . Nothing alive there . What could be so poisonous in the ground here that neither trees nor grass could grow here ? It had to be something artificial , because the clearing was so perfectly round . A slight breeze stirred a few of the leaves in the clearing . A few blew away from the rise in the center of the clearing , and now it looked to Vanya as if it was not a rock or some machine , for the shape under the leaves undulated like the lines of a human body . And there , where the head should be , was that a human face just visible ? Another leaf drifted away . It had to be a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , to cover her ? Or was she injured , lying here so long that the leaves had gathered . Was she dead ? Was the skin stretched taut across the cheekbones like a mummy ? From this distance , he could not see . And a part of him did not want to see , wanted instead to run away and hide , because if she was dead then for the first time his dreams of tragedy would come true , and he did not want them to be true , he realized now . He did not want to clear the leaves away and find a dead woman who had merely been running through the woods and hit her head on a limb and managed to stagger into the midst of this clearing , hoping that she could signal some passing airplane , only she fell unconscious and died and ... He wanted to run away , but he also wanted to see her , to touch her ; if she was dead , then to see death , to touch it . He raised his foot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ordinary , the leaves swirled away from his foot as if he had stirred a whirlwind , and to his shock he realized that this clearing was not like the forest floor at all . For the leaves swirled deeper and deeper , clearing away from his feet to reveal that he was standing at the edge of a precipice . This was no clearing , this was a deep basin , a round pit cut deeply into the earth . How deep it was , he could n't guess , for the leaves still swirled away , deeper , deeper , and the wind that had arisen from the movement of his leg carried them up and away , twisting into the sky like a pillar of smoke . If that was a woman lying there , then she must be lying on a pedestal arising from the center of this deep hollow . Women who bumped their heads into tree limbs did not climb down a precipice like this and climb up a tower in the middle . Something else was going on here , something darker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , but now many of the leaves that had blown up from Vanya 's feet were coming to rest , and he could n't quite see her face . No , there it was , or where it should have been . But no face now , just leaves . I imagined it , he thought . It was that leaf  --  I thought it was a nose . There 's no woman there . Just a strange rock formation . And a pit in the middle of the forest that had filled with leaves . Maybe it was the crater from an old meteor strike . That would make sense . As he stood there , imagining the impact of a stone from space , something moved on the far side of the clearing . Or rather , it moved under the far side of the clearing , for he saw only that the leaves began to churn in one particular place , and then the churning moved around the circle , heading toward him . A creature that lived in this hollow , under the leaves like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come near me and throw a tentacle up onto the shore and drag me down under the leaves and eat me , casting only my indigestible head up onto the center pedestal , where it would eventually lure some other wanderer to step off into the pit to be devoured in his turn . The churning under the leaves came closer . In the battle between Vanya 's curiosity and his morbid imagination , the imagination finally won . He turned and ran , no longer bounding over the forest floor , but trying to dig in and put on speed . Of course this meant that his feet kept losing purchase as leaves slipped under them , and he fell several times until he was covered with leafmold and dirt , with bits of old leaves in his hair . Where was the road ? Was the creature from the pit following him through the forest ? He was lost , it would turn to night and the monster would find him by his smell and devour him slowly , from the feet up ... There was the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run faster and longer than he thought . On the familiar road , with the afternoon sun still shining on him , he felt safer . He jogged along , then walked the last bit to Cousin Marek 's farm . Vanya never got a chance to tell about his adventure . Mother took one look at him and ordered him to bathe immediately , they 'd been searching high and low for him , there was almost no time at all to get ready , where had he been ? The visas had come through suddenly , the flight would leave in two days , they had to drive tonight to get to the train station so they could get to Kiev in time to catch the airplane to Austria . Eventually , when they had time to relax a little , sitting on the plane as it flew to Vienna , Vanya did n't bother to tell them about his childish scare in the woods . What would it matter ? He 'd never see those woods again . Once you left Russia there was no going back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient forest . It would just have to live on in his memory , a question never to be answered . Or , more likely , the memory of a childish scare that he had worked himself into because he always imagined such dramatic things . By the time the plane landed in Vienna and the reporters flashed their lightbulbs and pointed TV cameras at them and the officials inspected their visas and various people descended on them to insist that his parents go to Israel as they promised or to inform them that they had the right to do whatever they wanted , now that they were in the free world  --  by this point , Vanya had persuaded himself that there was never a human face in the clearing , the pit was not as deep as he imagined , and the churning of the leaves had been the wind or perhaps a rabbit burrowing its way through . No peril . No murder . No mystery . Nothing to wonder about . No reason for it to keep cropping up in his dreams , haunting his childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And even as he told himself that nothing had happened in the woods that day , he knew that something had happened , and now he would never know what the clearing was , or what might have happened had he stayed .
