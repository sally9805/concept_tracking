The Land By Mildred D. Taylor Phyllis Fogelman Books I loved my daddy . I loved my brothers too . But in the end it was Mitchell Thomas and I who were most like brothers , with a bond that could n't be broken . The two of us came into Mississippi together by way of East Texas , and that was when we were still boys , long after we had come to our understanding of each other . Seeing that we were a long way from our Georgia home and both of us being strangers here in Mississippi , the two of us depended on each other and became as family . But it was n't always that way . In the beginning the two of us did n't get along at all . Fact to business , there was a time it seemed like to me Mitchell Thomas lived just to taunt me . There were other boys too who picked on me , but Mitchell was the worst . I recall one time in particular when I was about nine or so and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mitchell came up from behind me and just whopped me on the head . For no reason . Just whopped me on the head ! Course I jumped up mad . " What ya do that for ? " I cried . " Felt like it , " he said . That 's all ; he felt like it . " Ya wan na do somethin ' ' bout it ? " But I said nothing . Sure , I wanted to do something about it , all right , but I was no fool . Besides the fact I was a small-built boy , Mitchell was a year and some months older than me , a big boy too , stronger than most boys his age , and he could 've broken me in two if he 'd had the mind . Mitchell stared at me and I stared at him , then he turned and walked away . He did n't laugh , he did n't gloat ; he just walked away , but I knew he 'd be back . And he was . Time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Mitchell 's way , but that did n't solve the problem . So I went to my sister , Cassie , about Mitchell . Now , my sister was a beautiful girl and I knew even Mitchell had eyes for her . But Cassie was not only beautiful , she was tough , smart , and just a bit cocky . She was six years older than I was and pretty much like a mother hen when it came to me ; I knew she 'd take my part . " Cassie , you know ' bout Mitchell ? " I asked her . " Course I know about Mitchell , " she answered . " Why 're you letting him beat up on you ? " " I 'm not letting him ! " I exclaimed in outrage . " You thinking I 'm liking him beating up on me ? " " Well , if you 're not , you 'd better make him stop . " " Well , I 'm trying . " " Well , you 'd better try harder . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thing is , I do n't know how to stop him . " " You 'd better figure a way , " she said matter-of-factly , then looked me in the eyes . " You want me to talk to him ? " I did n't even need to think on that . " Naw , course not ! You did , then they 'd all be saying I had my sister fighting my battles ! " Cassie shrugged . " Then you 'd better figure something out quick . " Well , I did n't figure anything out quick enough before Mitchell whalloped me again . And again . Finally things got so bad , I told my daddy about Mitchell and about how he and other boys too were always picking on me . Now , the thing was , Mitchell and his family and the other boys lived on my daddy 's land , and I figured my daddy with one word could put a stop to Mitchell and the rest . But my daddy said , " What you expect me to do about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though I knew exactly what I wanted him to do about it . " You expect me to stop this boy Mitchell and the others from messing with you ? " I did n't say anything . " You want it stopped , Paul , " he said , " then you stop it . This here is between you and Mitchell and whatever other boys . I 'm not getting into it . " My daddy was true to his word too . More than one time he saw me with a busted lip or a bruised eye , but he showed me no sympathy . He just looked at me and said , " See you did n't stop it yet . " After a while , though , he said , " Paul , you do n't stop this soon , those boys are going to kill you . " " Well , they 're bigger and stronger'n me ! " I protested . " Then you use what you strongest at , boy ! You use your head . Now take care of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I enlisted the aid of my brothers , Hammond , George , and Robert . I figured Hammond and George could sure enough stop Mitchell . Course , they already knew of my troubles . They 'd seen my busted lip and bruises too , but they had been away at school during most of the time Mitchell had been beating on me , and I had n't been able to turn to them for my rescue . Robert , of course , had wanted to help me out , but there had n't been much he could do . He was as small as I was . Now Hammond and George were back home and I figured to settle this thing . " So what do you want us to do ? " Hammond asked . I was looking for complete and absolute revenge , and I figured Hammond at eighteen and George at sixteen could provide that for me . " Put the fear of God into ' em ! " I declared . Hammond smiled ; so did George . Robert , though , nodded solemnly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same age as me . Of my brothers , I was closest with Robert . I suppose , in part , being the same year 's children made us close , but there were other things too . We had been together practically since birth , and we always took care of each other . When I got into trouble , Robert was there to pull me out of it if he could , or at least to see me through it , and I did the same for him . More than one time when one of us would be getting a licking from either my mama or our daddy , the other would jump in to try to stop it and we 'd both get whipped . We shared everything together . Back then , Robert was always on my side . " They got no business beating on you , " Robert said , expressing my sentiments exactly . " That 's what I figure too , " I said . " We 'll take care of ' em tomorrow , " Robert promised . " Now wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know if that 's such a good idea . " " What 's not good about it ? " I asked . " Mitchell and those other boys been beating on me for the longest time , so y'all go beat on them awhile and they 'll stop . " Hammond was quiet a moment , then said , " Well , I do n't know if that 's quite fair . " " Sounds fair to me . " " Me too , " said Robert . " But George and I are older than Mitchell and those other boys , and we 'd have the advantage , " said Hammond . " Well , that 's the point of the thing ! " I said . Hammond shook his head . " ' Sides that , they live here on our place , and if we get into it with them , it 'll look like we 're bullying them " " Well , they 've been bullying me ! " George looked at me dead center . " You tell our daddy about this ? " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid things right on the line ; he said exactly what was on his mind . On the surface he was an easygoing sort of boy with a body that seemed to hang in a lazy fashion , such as always having one leg dangling over the arm of a chair when our daddy was n't around . But the truth was , he had himself a fierce kind of temper when baited and a steely right hand to match . He had never used either against me . I always told him the truth . " I told him , all right , " I replied in answer to his question . " Well , what 'd he say ? " I did n't speak right up . " Well ? I know he said something . " " He told me he was n't getting into it . He told me to stop it , so that 's what I 'm trying to do . " George laughed . " Yeah , you trying to stop it , all right . You trying to get us to stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert . Those were my thoughts exactly . " Look , Paul , " said Hammond . I 'll have a talk with Mitchell , but I 'm not going to go beating up on him for you . Understood ? " I looked at Hammond and nodded solemnly , but I was figuring the only thing Mitchell Thomas would ever understand was a good whipping . That very next morning Robert and I , sitting behind Hammond and George on their bays , went over to the patch of ground Mitchell 's family tended . Now , the Thomases , like all the other families who lived on my daddy 's land , were sharecroppers , and because of that fact , they were obliged to take heed of whatever my daddy or my brothers said . Miz Thomas was sure enough taking heed right now . " Edna , " said Hammond as Mitchell 's mother stood in her dark doorway , " where 's Willie ? " Willie Thomas was Mitchell 's daddy . " He gone off already ? ' " Yes , suh , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , does n't matter . We come to see Mitchell . He with his daddy ? " " Mitchell ? " questioned Miz Thomas . " Well , suh , he 's out in them woods yonder choppin ' wood for the fire . " Hammond nodded . " Whereabout ? " " North yonder ... by the creek . " " All right , " said Hammond . " We 'll find him . " We turned to go , but then Miz Thomas said , " That Mitchell , he done somethin ' ? He in trouble ? " " We just want to talk to him , Edna , " Hammond assured her . Still , though , as we rode away , I saw Miz Thomas frown , and young as I was , I knew she was worried . She was worried because my brothers had come . My brothers had come asking about Mitchell , and my brothers were white . The Georgia sun was blazing by the time my brothers and I located Mitchell chopping wood on the north bank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stacking the logs he split . As we dismounted , Mitchell struck his axe into a fallen log , then yanked it out again and held it across his chest . To tell the truth , I 'd have preferred it if we had found him tending some other chore . I for one knew that Mitchell had a hot temper , and there was no telling what he might take a notion to do with that axe . Hammond , though , seemed to take no notice of the axe as he and George walked over to Mitchell . Robert and I staved by the horses . " See you got quite a woodpile there , Mitchell , " said Hammond cordially . Mitchell glanced over at me , then back at Hammond before he nodded . " Yeah , " he said . His brothers were silent and still . " Well , now , Mitchell , " Hammond went on , " we rode over because we wanted to have a little talk with you . " " That 's right , " said George . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I appreciated the fact that George was getting right to the heart of this matter . " Quite often , as a matter of fact . " Mitchell 's grip tightened on the axe , but he said nothing . " We 'd like to know why , " said Hammond . I kept my eyes on the axe . I felt like I needed to warn Hammond and George . They did n't know how crazy Mitchell could be . " We 'd like to know why you have it in for Paul , " Hammond went on . " Did he do something to you ? ' Mitchell eyed his axe and did n't speak . Hammond and George waited ; then George grew impatient . " Well ? Do n't you have anything to say ? Did Paul do something to you or not ? " Mitchell kept on looking at that axe . " Speak up ! " Mitchell then shook his head . " Naw , " he mumbled , but I could see his fingers tightening on the handle . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Hammond , " then I see no reason for you to be continuously picking on him . You 're older than him , bigger than him , and it 's certainly not a fair kind of thing . " " We want it stopped , " said George , as if that should put an end to the matter right there , and I thought , Good . Now we 're getting to the point of this thing . Hammond continued to be diplomatic . " We want you two to try to be friends , Mitchell . We 're all living here on the same land , and we all have to work together , so I do n't want to hear of any more fights between the two of you . Understood ? " Mitchell once again had nothing to say . George lost patience and grasped the handle of Mitchell 's axe . " Boy , you better answer ! " he demanded , but Mitchell in a dangerous move yanked on the axe . George too yanked on the axe in an attempt to twist it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping between George and Mitchell . George 's hand slipped from the axe , but he still tried to get at Mitchell . Hammond pushed him back . " Stop it , George ! " he ordered . Then he turned to Mitchell . " Now , you , boy , you put that axe down . " There was a moment when I did n't know if Mitchell would obey . Hammond did n't waver . " I said put it down ! Now ! " Mitchell looked at George , at Hammond , then slammed the axe into a log . Hammond stepped back calmly . " There 's to be no more of that . " George shoved past Hammond and pointed his finger right in Mitchell 's face . " You try that on me again and I 'll have your head , boy ! You hear me ? You best be remembering I 'm not Paul ! " I was afraid Mitchell was going to slap George 's hand away and the two of them would get into it right there , but Mitchell only glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them and said to Mitchell , " There 's to be no more fighting with Paul . " Mitchell looked at the ground . " Is that understood ? " Mitchell looked up , first at Hammond , then at me , and I felt my knees go weak . " Yeah , " he mumbled , his eyes fixed on me , and at that moment I knew that my troubles with Mitchell were far from over . And I was right . The next time Mitchell Thomas caught up with me alone , he near to whipped the living daylights out of me . " Now , go tell your brothers ' bout this beatin ' , you white nigger ! " he cried as he pummeled me . " For all I care , you can tell yo ' white daddy ' bout it too ! " But after Mitchell got finished beating on me , I told no one . Instead , I made my way over to the creek and sat on its bank , looked out over my daddy 's land , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , what Mitchell said was true : I did have a white daddy . My daddy was Edward Logan , and Edward Logan was a much-respected man . He was a prosperous man too , or at least he had been before the war had come in I86I , and still now that the war was over by several years , he was doing better than most . He owned a lot of land , and until a few years back he had owned his share of slaves too . My mama had been one of those slaves . My mama was called by the name of Deborah , and she was equally of the African people and of the native people , the Indians , whom we called the Nation . She was a beautiful woman . My daddy took a liking to her soon after she came into her womanhood , and he took her for his colored woman , and that 's how my older sister Cassie and I came to be . Cassie and I were our daddy 's children , and both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of white men who fathered colored children in those days , even though the law said no white man could legally father a black child ; that was in part so no child of color could inherit from his white daddy . Some white men took care of their colored children ; most did n't . My daddy was one who did . Not only did he take care of Cassie and me , but he acknowledged that we were his , though it was quietly spoken , and he raised us as his , pretty much the same as his white children , and that 's what made us different , what made me different . I was a colored boy who looked almost white . Though I had a mixed look to me , upon first seeing me , most folks thought I was white , and for some folks , if they did n't know different , they kept thinking so . My hair was brown and straight and hung somewhat long most times , to my shoulders . Some called that the Indian look in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what some folks call olive for some reason , and my features being what they were , people made their own judgments about who and what I was . Because my daddy was who he was , I had some of the privileges of a white boy , privileges denied to Mitchell and other colored folks on the place . Cassie and I sat right alongside Hammond , George , and Robert at our daddy 's table . We wore good clothes , and our daddy educated us . He 'd taught us himself how to read and write and figure , even though when he taught Cassie , it was against the law at the time , and when he taught me , it was against what so many of his white neighbors held dear . He also made Hammond and George and Robert share their books and all their school learning with us . When he traveled on business around the community , he oftentimes took me with him , along with my brothers . Just by being with Edward Logan and a part of his world , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color on the place were privy to . My daddy protected me , and I was treated almost as if I were white . Yes , I was different , all right , and that was a fact . I sat there by the creek thinking on that , and finally decided it was no wonder Mitchell Thomas could n't stand the sight of me . I supposed if I 'd been Mitchell , I wouldn't 've liked me much either . I remember Robert came along as I was sitting there dwelling on all this and wanted to know what had happened . " What you think ? " I said . " Mitchell ? " " Mitchell . " Robert heaved a sigh and sat down beside me . " Looks bad . " " Feels worse . " " Why 'd he do it this time ? " I looked at Robert . Though I 'd figured it out , I was n't ready to talk about it . " Same as always , " I said . " He just does n't like me . " Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long while . Robert threw rocks into the creek , letting me be , and if he figured I was holding something back , he did n't say so . Robert and I did n't need to talk ; we were that close . Some time passed ; then Robert spoke again . " You want to fish awhile ? " I glanced over at the rock opening where we kept our poles and shook my head . " Do n't feel like it . " " Wan na do anything ? " " Not really . " " You hurting ? " " What you think ? " " Want me to get Hammond and George ? " I shook my head . " What you going to do ? " " Sit right here . " " Okay , " said Robert . " I 'll sit with you . " He continued to throw his rocks . I continued to stare out at the creek , and we said no more . ( Continues ... )             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
