Headnote As her husband 's political star ascends and the race for the White House heats up , MICHELLE OBAMA , an accomplished woman in her own right , keeps Barack Obama grounded and her finger on the pulse of what women are thinking . Journalist Gwen Ifill joins her on the campaign trail Michelle Obama strolls through the campaign headquarters on the eleventh floor of a nondescript downtown Chicago high-rise like a queen . Long-limbed and striking , she is not dressed like a candidate 's wife . No jewel-toned knits or demure knee-length skirts . It 's hot outside , so her shoulders are bare . Campaign workers fall silent as she glides by , more awed than intimidated . Michelle Obama , wife of Illinois Senator Barack Obama , does not act like a candidate 's wife , either . When standing on stage by her husband 's side , there is none of that dutiful head nodding . Her gaze is fixed on him but there is not an ounce of subservience in it . Still it is clear that when they are together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband continues to turn heads in his bid to become the nation 's first African-American president , Michelle Obama just might be the campaign 's secret weapon . ON THE ROAD WITH MICHELLE It is the early days of this campaign , so covering Michelle Obama is not yet the mob experience it soon will be . This is my sixth presidential campaign , and it feels downright peaceful . Part of this comes from traveling with the spouse , not the principal . The other part comes from being in the presence of Michelle Obama herself . In years of watching candidates negotiate long campaign days , I 've seen a lot of them sweat Not Michelle . Cool and certain , she makes it clear that she has embarked on this adventure on her own terms . When campaigning solo , as she was at an awards luncheon in New York City recently , Michelle is apt to scribble her own remarks , and then toss them aside if the occasion warrants it That sort of flexibility comes in handy when the lawyer you married decides he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is key to the plan to pull this off , because with the loyalties of women voters in the balance , the hope is that Michelle will help Barack tip the scales . On the stump , her studied warmth is a contrast to her husband 's brainy cool . More than one person in the Obama camp whispers that she , in fact , is the more compelling speaker . " We need to change the face of the conversation , ladies , " she tells the mostly female audience at a rally in Las Vegas . " We sat back too long , suffering in silence , avoiding these challenges . We ca n't do that any longer . We need a man " - she stops and edits herself- " a person who happens to be a man , who is ready to help us turn the page to bring a new conversation to the table , to change the lives of women and children across America . " I first encountered the Obamas in the most public of ways : onstage at the 2004 Democratic National Convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope and unity . With the sheen of the moment still bouncing off them both , they waded through the applause over to my NewsHour camera position . I asked him one of those awful broadcaster 's questions : How did it feel ? " You 're just trying to make sure you do n't screw up , " he responded . It was n't until two years later.in his best-selling book , The Audacity of Hope , that I discovered where those words came from : Michelle . Her final words to him before he went to the podium that night-delivered with a hug-were , " Just do n't screw it up , buddy . " Since then , Michelle has been both admired and criticized for being a successful working mother who decided to take a backseat to her husband 's ambitions . But she is not listening to the critics . " I know who I need to be , " she tells me as she cools her heels in a borrowed conference room between campaign appearances in New York " IVe come to know myself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 33 , I 'd still be struggling with that . But I 'm a grown-up . And IVe seen it up , and IVe seen it down , and I know who I need to be to stay true to who I am and to keep my family on track We do n't always figure that out for ourselves as women . " Barack Obama , chatting by phone from the trail , says , " There 's no doubt that a lot of women identify with Michelle , because she 's prototypical of women who came of age when they had career opportunities that did n't exist in the past , yet they continue to cherish and value their family lives . " Still , Michelle admits it 's not easy . " I think my generation of professional women are sort of waking up and realizing that we potentially may not be able to have it ail-not at the same time , " she says . FROM THE SOUTH SIDE TO PRINCETON As the nation figures out who Michelle Obama is , she could well end UP being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react to an educated Black woman who adheres to no widely accepted stereotype ? Nettie Harrison , a retired Hack educator who braved the heat to see Michelle in Las Vegas , says she expected to hear more about the political than the personal , but was pleased it was the other way around . " So many times we have people who are born with that spoon in their mouth , " she says , as Michelle shook hands a few feet away , " and they have noconcept of where a lot of us have come from , or where we are going . " Where Michelle LaVaughn Robinson " came from " is the storied South Side of Chicago . She grew up with her older brother , Craig , in a modest bungalow owned by working-class parents . Their father , Fraser Robinson , who died in 1990 , worked as a pump operator most of his adult life . Even though he suffered from multiple sclerosis , he managed to send his children to Princeton and leave a pension for his widow . Craig is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What you see when you see my sister is my sister , " he tells ESSENCE . " You do n't see someone pretending to be someone else or someone who thought she was going to grow up to be a first lady . " After graduating from Princeton with honors in 1985 , Michelle earned a Harvard law degree in 1988 , and went home to work in the law firm of Sidley Austin Brown &; Wood , where she met Barack . She was initially assigned to supervise her future husband . " I thought This is probably just a Black man who can talk straight . That 's why they 're excited about him , " she tells audiences . So she lowered her expectations . But he was cuter than she expected . And Baracktookherto church basements , where he spoke to groups of inner-city women who were more worried about making the rent than marching on City HaIL " He connected with me and everyone in that church basement just like he is connecting with you , " she tells the women in Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that resonated with people , that was real And right then and there , I decided this guy was special . The authenticity you see is real , and that 's why I fell in love with him . " Michelle Obama 's career since then has been a blend of public service and public and private practice . Her experience , she says , influences her latest risky role : stepping out onto the political ledge to grasp for an elusive brass ring . There is a chance they might slip , a chance they might fall , but in her down-to-earth way , Michelle says it 's a risk they will take . " Our challenges get publicized , and I see that as a gift to let people know there is no magic to this , " she says . But observers want to know what kind of first lady would Michelle Obama be ? The Hillary Clinton model-a power behind the throne ? Or the Laura Bush model-a demure partner who does actually invite people to the White House for tea ? Whatever it takes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more traditional first lady , well , I can do that . It would not emasculate me , " she says , leaning forward in the Chicago conference room . " But it would n't look like everybody else 's ; it would have a Michelle Obama flair to it , right ? Because I am who I am . " STILL GROUNDED Michelle likes to remind audiences her husband is just a man-at once extraordinary and quite ordinary-a man who forgets to pick up his socks . Her intent is to humanize the man many see as the Great Black Hope . She is untroubled by early critics who have said she is too dismissive of her husband , or that she should not have scaled back her career to serve his presidential ambitions . " I know that I ca n't do it all , " she offers flatly as we chat in Chicago . " I can not be involved in a presidential campaign , hold down a full-time senior-level position , get my kids to camp , and exercise and eat right I know I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Fm going to put it on the table . You 've got to make trade-offs in life . I 'm okay with that . I 've come to realize I am sacrificing one set of things in my life for something else potentially really positive . " That " something " is the vision of her husband in the White House as the nation 's first African-American president . If that sounds audacious , that 's because it is . And in her own way-she works out every morning and tells her audiences they should too , she 's raising two girls while running a major health-care system , and her nails and hair are never unkempt-Michelle Obama is audacious , too . But , just as an assertive woman is so frequently labeled aggressive , an audacious Black woman runs the risk of appearing-well , there is not another way to say it-uppity . In the political world , where the spotlight shines especially bright , perception is everything . So there is no talk in the Obama campaign of a " two-for-one " presidency , as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Senator Obama says he doubts his wife would even want a White House policy gig . " That tends not to be the role Michelle likes to play , " he says . " She knows she 's got influence with me and does n't need to be overt to let her opinions get known . " A few weeks after meeting in New York City , we are in Las Vegas , where it is 100 degrees outside . A couple of hundred women have crowded into a community center to see Michelle . She looks as fresh as ever , but this is not her normal comfort zone . She has stepped back from her $213,000 salary as vice-president of community and external affairs for the University of Chicago Hospitals to step up to the unpredictability of the trail . " I 'm here not just because I 'm the wife of a candidate , " she tells the attentive audience , most of them middle-aged women , many of them Black . " Because this is hard , " she says with a hint of weariness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is n't a natural choice to be made in your life . It 's strange , all this . " So why bother ? " I 'm here as a woman , as a mother , as a citizen of this country , " she goes on , smiling as she connects to the crowd . " And I am so tired of the way things are . " When Michelle speaks like this , a little of the South Side comes out . She has a matter-of-fact delivery that is familiar to Black women-less so to others . While her husband 's campaign may have been embraced by many convinced he can somehow " transcend race , " one of those people is not his wife . While in New York City , we walk past a television tuned to CNN . Barack Obama , the newscaster reports , is about to become the first candidate in the race-other than Hillary Clinton-to get Secret Service protection . When I visit with her at the campaign 's Chicago headquarters weeks later , I ask if any of this scares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you know what ? Something really powerful might also happen . And you might grow and learn and benefit others . " Older African-Americans worry about Barack 's safety , but she says we must let go of fear . " WeVe let fear squash us for real legitimate reasons , " she says . " But if you focus on fear , you do nothing . " Senator Obama acknowledges his wife was resistant at first to the idea of his running for president two years into his first Senate term . " We have n't had a lot of peace and quiet over the last four years , " he says . " Michelle 's always had veto power , and always will , over decisions that have a direct impact on her . " David Axelrod , the campaign 's chief strategist , says Michelle 's veto power played out in the weeks leading up to the campaign . " Shewasinterested in whether it was a crazy , harebrained idea , " he says over coffee in Chicago . " Because she 's not into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barack had to go for it . And so did she . " I took myself down every dark road you could go on , just to prepare myself before we jumped out there , " she says . " Are we emotionally , financially ready for this ? I dreamed out all the scenarios . The bottom line is , man , the little sacrifice we have to make is nothing compared to the possibility of what we could do if this catches on . " For Michelle , the campaign is a particularly intricate juggling act . In Las Vegas , she began her day scarfing down a veggie frittata at a breakfast for selected supporters . Her daughters , Malia , 9 , and Sasha , 6 , were back in the hotel playing with the remote control and preparing for an afternoon at the pool . The girls , and sometimes Michelle 's mother , Marian Robinson , travel with her when they are not attending private school in Chicago . Back home , she explains , " IVe got my community , family , neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . And it 's easier to stay grounded if the people you are surrounding yourself with really know you . You ca n't get too big or too taken if your mother 's looking atyou thinking , iknowwhoyou are . " A METHOD TO THE MADNESS As the campaign has come to demand more and more of her time , it 's fallen to Michelle to hit the trail by day and be mother by night . That is a big part of the story she tells on the stump . " I get them to a neighbor 's if I ca n't get them to school , " she says of her children , as women in the audience nod . " I get on a plane . I come to a city . I do several events . I get on a plane . I get home before bedtime . And by doing that , yeah , I 'm a little tired at the end of the day , but the girls , they just think Mommy was at work . They do n't know I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Obamas could not possibly have any idea what awaits them . The white-hot spotlight of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is like no other . Everything , from how she dresses and where they choose to send the kids to school , will become fodder for every pundit and blogger with a laptop . Her solution ? Put other people 's outsized expectations aside , and take it as it comes . " I tell myself all the time , we 're supposed to take the risk , " she says . " In the end , I think we have an obligation to give it a shot . To do our best . To give people a choice .
