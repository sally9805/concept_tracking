<p> Sheikh Mahdi Ahmed al-Sumaidi was detained in Abu Ghraib prison early this year after a weapons cache was found in his Ibn Taymiyyah mosque . Since released , his anti-US fervor is undiminished . " Neither the occupation forces nor the government they installed is acceptable , " he says . " The legitimate power is the resistance . " <p> Even so , he is grateful for the US invasion . " God uses many tools , " he says . " America 's brutality has caused many to understand that Islam is the answer to our problems . The only solution is Islamic government . " <p> Sheikh Sumaidi is one of a cadre of Sunni preachers whose star has risen sharply in the past year . No longer constrained or exiled by a repressive regime , they are preaching jihad at key mosques and pushing to make Iraq an Islamic state . <p> They are still on the fringes of mainstream Sunni practice here . But amid almost daily firefights in the Sunni Triangle , these radical preachers are emerging as the principal Sunni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly among the frustrated and disadvantaged , " says Sadoun al-Dulame , who runs the Iraq Center for Research and Strategic Studies in Baghdad . " All the violence is allowing extremists to mobilize and try to monopolize political space . " <p> The preachers ' opponents call them Wahhabis , after the dominant religious ideology of Saudi Arabia . But many prefer to refer themselves as salafy , which emphasizes their desire to return the Islamic world to the practices that prevailed at the time of Mohammad , which they see as a golden age . While the US project was to mold a secular Iraq friendly to the West , the salafys ' religious beliefs are not far from Al Qaeda 's . <p> Now , they 're playing an increasingly visible political role . When hostages are taken , diplomats quietly contact them , hoping they can secure their release . When interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi wants to negotiate with insurgents in the war-torn town of Fallujah , now in the hands of Sunni jihadis , he goes through their mosques . And increasingly , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fraught time in their lives , they turn to these mosques . <p> A receptive ear <p> Hussein al-Khaisi , who runs a small shop selling nuts and dates in Baghdad , is one of scores of Iraqi men whose faith has deepened since the US invasion , and he 's now a regular attendant at the small An Nur mosque in Baghdad . " During the US invasion , I saw so much chaos and death that I turned to God , " he says . " Now there is so much corruption and violence that we need an Islamic government according to sharia . That would stop a lot of the suffering we have now . " <p> Sheikh Ayad Ahmed al-Jubari runs the An Nur mosque and says attendance has grown since the invasion , which he says has helped Iraqis see the truth of Islam . He 's also been freer to speak his mind - the regime of Saddam Hussein closely controlled political activity at Iraq 's mosques . He says ongoing fighting in the Sunni triangle has drawn more people into his circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of terror , but God wanted it to be a place to strengthen the resistance , " says Sheikh Jubari , who goes on to say that Fallujah is now a place of near-miracles . He says the blood of men " martyred " in the fight against the US smells like perfume and that , somehow , insurgents ' weapons seemed to never run out of bullets during the April fighting . <p> Sheikh Jubari also praises the beheadings of " spies " - like Korean translator Kim Sun Il last month - and says it 's appropriate to stage attacks on anyone connected with the US . <p> Mr. Dulame says it 's a mistake to focus exclusively on Sunni groups - pointing out that Shiite religious movements like Moqtada al-Sadr 's Mahdi Army have used murder and intimidation as well . <p> But most of the insurgent activity inside Iraq - be it car-bombings of police stations , assassinations of top Iraqi officials , or the gun battle between US soldiers and insurgents early Sunday in the town of Buhriz that left 13 insurgents dead - is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fighting with US forces . <p> The political angle <p> While insurgents continue to fight the hot war in the Sunni triangle , Sunni Islamist preachers in Baghdad are seeking to build a political base . At their forefront is Harith al-Dari , a preacher who returned home from the United Arab Emirates after Hussein 's ouster . His family has deep roots here , and his grandfather is said to have murdered a British Army officer in 1920 , triggering Iraq 's first revolution . <p> He quickly installed himself in the " Mother of All Battles " Mosque , a sprawling complex Hussein built to celebrate surviving the first Gulf War , complete with minarets shaped like rifle barrels and missiles and with a vast marble representation of Iraq in its main hall , with the words " God grants many victories " written across it . <p> Sheikh Dari renamed the mosque the " Mother of All Villages , " in a reference to Mecca , and established the Association of Muslim Scholars , a Sunni group that he hopes will come to rival the Shiite clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of the year , they 've also become important brokers between foreign officials , the US-installed interim government , and the jihadis thought to be behind most of the kidnappings . <p> Sheikh Dari has helped release more than a dozen hostages through his contacts , though he and his aides insist that does n't mean they belong to the insurgency . " We do n't have anything to do with these groups that take hostages , " says Ahmed al-Samarai , Dari 's No. 2 . " We completely reject these hostage takings and killings . It 's not Islamic . " <p> The association has recently been flexing its muscles . Sheikh Sammarai , who is from the tense Sunni town of Samarra , says he led a delegation to meet with Mr. Allawi about 10 days ago to complain about US plans to launch a strike on the town . Though fighting is not as hot as in Fallujah , the town is largely run by anticoalition insurgents . <p> Fears of fighting spurred thousands to flee the city and he said he prevailed on Allawi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evolving into a second Fallujah . <p> " I told him that if they went in to Samara it would only embarrass the government . He told me he 'd do whatever he could to stop violence there . " Sheikh Sammarai says most residents who fled have since returned home . <p> Though fiercely anti-American , the association 's rhetoric is less militant than many of the emerging preachers , particularly when it comes to relations with Iraq 's Shiites , who make up about 60 percent of the population . Hard-core salafys reject cooperation with the Shiites and say they deviate from acceptable doctrine . <p> For instance , after Sheikh Sumaidai took over his mosque , a Baroque building filled with Persian rugs and elegant lanterns that was built in the 1960s to celebrate Baath Party " martyrs , " his renaming it " Ibn Taymiyyah " clearly signaled his intent . <p> Taymiyyah was a 14th-century preacher who has strongly influenced modern militant Islamic movements . He considered violent jihad the highest duty of Muslims , and dismissed practices like those of the Shiites as verging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sects . <p> But Dari and Samarai have sought to build bridges to Shiite leaders . On Friday , Samarai led prayers and called repeatedly for unity between the two sects . " People must stand together and forgive each other . The occupiers do n't see any difference between us , and God wo n't grant us victory unless we unite , " he says . Samarai says he wants insurgents to focus exclusively on US forces , instead of the attacks that have taken an increasing number of Iraqi lives . <p> Masking extreme ambitions <p> Dari 's organization has also come under fire from some erstwhile allies for speaking out against kidnapping and working to get hostages released . An audio tape purported to be from Abu Musab Zarqawi , the Jordanian militant with Al Qaeda ties who the US claims uses Fallujah as a base , attacked Dhari in June for criticizing hostage beheadings . <p> But Dari 's critics say the relative moderation in public masks more extreme ambitions . " They 're talking sweetly , but they want to remake this country like Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Already , more liberal Sunni visits are being constrained . Dulame , the political scientist , spoke a few weeks ago on Al Jazeera against hostage-takers and extremists who , he says , want to deny Iraq the chance at becoming a fully open society . Shortly after that , an envelope with an AK-47 bullet and a note warning him to stop talking arrived at his office . He 's since moved to a lower-profile location . <p> " They 'll speak beautifully now , but their goal is to create a closed society that rejects Western values , " Dulame says . " If overall conditions do n't start to improve here , their voices are going to get stronger . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
