Chapter One&lt; When the dog deserted her and moved in with Jeffrey and his new bride , it was , for Phoebe Turlow , the proverbial last straw . She had weathered the divorce well enough , considering how many of her dreams had come crashing down in the process . She 'd even been philosophical about losing her job as a research assistant to Professor Benning , at a time when finding a comparable position was virtually impossible , given recent government budget cuts . After all , the professor had been writing and lecturing on the subject of American History at Seattle College for forty-five fruitful and illustrious years ; he was ready , by his own admission , to spend his days reading , fishing , and playing chess . Phoebe had held herself together , through it all . And now even Murphy , whom she 'd rescued from the pound as a mangy , slat-fibbed mongrel and carefully nursed back to health , had turned on her . She lowered the telephone receiver slowly back into its cradle , gazing at the dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glass reflected a hazy , pixielike image of a woman with short chestnut hair , large blue eyes , high cheekbones , and fair skin . But Phoebe was looking through herself , mentally reliving the phone call she 'd just received . Heather , Wife Number Two and widely proclaimed light of Jeffrey 's life , had n't been able  --  she probably had n't even tried  --  to suppress the smug note in her voice when she called to relay the news that the hound of hell was " safe and sound " in their kitchen . To hear Heather tell it , that furry ingrate had crossed a continent , fording icy rivers and surmounting insurmountable obstacles , enduring desperate privations of all sorts  --  Phoebe could almost hear the theme music of a new movie , rated G , of course . Murphy , Come Home . Muttering to herself , Phoebe crossed the worn linoleum floor , picked up the dog 's red plastic bowl , and dumped it into the trash , kibbles and all . She emptied the water dish and tossed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worn legs of her blue jeans and feeling more alone than ever before , Phoebe wandered into her small , uncarpeted living room and stared despondently out the front window . Mel , the postman , was just pulling up to her mailbox in his blue and white jeep . He tooted the horn and waved , and Phoebe waved back with a dispirited smile . Her unemployment check was due , but the prospect did n't cheer her up . If it had n't been for her savings and the small amount of insurance money she 'd received when her mother and stepfather were killed in a car accident years ago , Phoebe figured she would have been sitting on a rain-slicked sidewalk down by the Pike Place Market , with a cigar box in front of her to catch coins . Okay , she thought , maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration . She could last for about six months , if she did n't get a new job soon , and then she would join the ranks of Seattle 's panhandlers . An inspiring prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Snatching her blue hooded rain slicker from the peg beside the door and tossing it over her shoulders , Phoebe dashed out into the chilly drizzle to fetch her mail . She 'd sent out over fifty rsums since losing her job with Professor Benning  --  maybe there would be a positive response , or one of the rare , brightly colored cards her half brother , Eliott , sometimes sent from Europe or South America or Africa , or wherever he happened to be . Or a letter from a friend ... Except that all their friends were really Jeffrey 's , not hers . And that Eliott did n't give a damn about her , and never had . To him , she was a trifle , an unfortunate postscript to their mother 's life . She wished she could stop caring what he thought . Phoebe brought herself up short ; she was feeling sorry for herself , and that was against her personal code . Resolutely , she wrenched open the door of her rural mailbox , which was affixed to a rusted metal post by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a sales circular , and she would have crumpled it up and tossed it into the nearest mud puddle , but she could n't bring herself to litter . She walked slowly back up the cracked walk to her sagging porch and the open door beyond it . The bright yellow envelope , now sodden and limp from the rain , was addressed to " Occupant , " and the street numbers were off by two blocks . Damn , she thought , with a wry grimace . Even her junk mail belonged to somebody else . The letter was about to join Murphy 's kibbles and tooth-marked bowls when an impulse  --  maybe it was desperation , maybe it was some kind of weird premonition  --  made Phoebe stop . She carried it to her kitchen table , sat down  --  wondering all the while why she had n't just chucked the thing  --  opened it , and smoothed the single page inside with as much care as if it were an ancient scroll , unearthed only moments before . SUNSHINE ! screamed the cheaply printed block letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to resemble a telegram . SPARKLING , CRYSTAL BLUE SEAS ! VISIT PARADISE ISLAND ABSOLUTELY FREE ! WALK IN THE FABLED FOOTSTEPS OF DUNCAN ROURKE , THE PIRATE PATRIOT ! Phoebe was an intelligent adult . She 'd gone through college with zero emotional support from her family and had worked at a responsible job from the day she graduated until two months ago , when the academic roof had fallen in . She had voted in every election , and she was by no means naive  --  even if she had married Jeffrey Brewster with her eyes wide open . She knew a tacky advertising scheme when she saw one . All the same , the prospects of " sunshine " and " crystal blue seas " prodded at something slumbering deep in her heart , behind a bruise and a stack of dusty , broken hopes . She frowned . And there was that name , too  --  Duncan Rourke . She 'd seen it before  --  probably while doing research for Professor Benning . Phoebe rose from the table , leaving the sales flyer spread out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a cup of herbal tea . Knowing that the promise of a free trip to Paradise Island  --  wherever that might be  --  was a scam of some kind did nothing to quell the odd , excited sense of impending adventure tingling in the pit of her stomach . The kettle gave a shrill whistle , and Phoebe poured boiling water over a tea bag and carried her cup back to the table . She read the flyer again , this time very slowly and carefully , one eyebrow raised in skepticism , the fingers of her right hand buried in her short , tousled hair . To take advantage of the " vacation all her friends would envy , " Phoebe had only to inspect a " glamorous beachfront condominium guaranteed to increase in value " and listen to a sales pitch . In return , her generous benefactors would fly her to the small Caribbean island " justly named Paradise , " put her up in the " distinctive Eden Hotel for two fun-filled days and nights , " and provide one " gala affair , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one big rip-off , Phoebe insisted to herself , and yet she was intrigued , and perhaps just a little frantic . So what if she had to look at a condo made of ticky-tacky , watch a few promotional slides , and listen to a spiel from a schmaltzy , fast-talking salesman or two ? She needed to get away , if only for a weekend , and here was her chance to soak up some tropical sunshine without doing damage to her rapidly dwindling bank account . Phoebe 's conscience , always overactive , pricked a little . Okay , suppose she did call the toll-free number and book herself on the next flight to Paradise . She 'd be making the trip under false pretenses , since she had no intention of buying a condominium . Her credit was fine , but she was divorced , female , and unemployed , and there was no way she 'd ever qualify for a mortgage . Still , there was nothing in the flyer specifying that buyers had to be preapproved for a loan . It was an invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined the warmth of the sun on her face , in her hair , settling deep into her muscles and veins and organs , nourishing her very spirit . The yearning she felt was almost mystical , and wholly irresistible . She told herself that she who hesitates is lost , and that it could n't hurt to call , and then she walked over to the phone and punched in the number . Four hectic days later , Phoebe found herself on board a small chartered airplane , aimed in the general direction of the Caribbean , with her one bag tucked neatly under the seat . The man across the aisle wore plaid polyester pants and a sweater emblazoned with tiny golf clubs , and the woman sitting behind her sported white pedal pushers , copious varicose veins , a T-shirt showing two silhouettes engaged in either mortal combat or coitus , and a baseball cap adorned with tiny flashing Christmas tree lights . The seven other passengers were equally eccentric . Phoebe settled against the back of her seat with a sigh and closed her eyes , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue cashmere turtleneck , all purchased at Nordstrom with a credit card and a great deal of optimism . She might have been on a cut-rate night flight to Reno , she thought with rueful humor , judging by the costumes of her fellow travelers . The plane lifted off at seven o'clock in the morning , rising into the foggy skies over Seattle , and presently a flight attendant appeared . Since the aisle was too narrow for a cart , the slender young man carried a yellow plastic basket in one hand , dispensing peanuts and cola and other refreshments as he moved through the cabin . The woman in the battery-powered hat ordered a Bloody Mary and received a censuring stare and a generic beer for her trouble . Phoebe , who had planned to ask for mineral water , merely shook her head and smiled . She was making the trip under false pretenses , after all , and the less she accepted from these people in the way of amenities , the less guilt she would feel afterward . She tried to sleep and failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then pulled an ancient thin volume , purloined from Professor Benning 's extensive personal book collection , from her bag . The book , published years and years ago , was entitled Duncan Rourke , Pirate or Patriot ? Phoebe opened it to the first page , frowning a little , and began to read . Mr. Rourke , according to the biographer , had been born in Charles Town , in the colony of Carolina , to gentle and aristocratic people . His education was impeccable  --  he spoke French , Italian , and Spanish fluently and had a penchant for the work of poets , those of his own time , and those of antiquity . He was also known to be proficient with the harpsichord and the mandolin , as well as the sword and musket , and , the writer hinted , he 'd been no slouch in the boudoir , either . Phoebe yawned . Duncan Rourke , it seemed , had qualified as a Renaissance man . She read on . Until the very day of his death , no one had known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Speculation abounded , of course . For her part , Phoebe wondered why he could n't have been both rascal and paragon ? No one , after all , was entirely good or bad  --  a human being , particularly a complex one , as Rourke must have been , could hardly be reduced to one dimension . Presently , Phoebe closed her eyes  --  and the musty pages of the old book  --  and a faint smile trembled on her lips . Pondering Mr. Rourke 's morality , or lack of same , she slept at long last . 1780 Paradise Island , the Caribbean Duncan Rourke sat at the table in his study , full of consternation , affection , and a vast , roiling uneasiness . The precious letter , penned by Duncan 's sister , Phillippa , and dispatched to him months before by devious and complex means , lay before him , slightly crumpled . " Come home ... " the diabolical angel had written , in her ornate and flowing script . Please , Duncan , I implore you to act for our sakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , if not for your own . You must return to the bosom of your family . Surely nothing more would be required to prove your loyalty to His Majesty than this . Papa might then cease his endless pacing  --  he traverses the length of his study , over and over again , night after night , from moonrise until the sun 's awakening  --  if only he knew you could be counted among the King 's men , like himself and our esteemed elder brother , Lucas ... Papa fears , dear Duncan , as we all do , that your escapades in those southerly seas you so love will be misunderstood , that you will be arrested or even hanged ... Duncan sighed and reached for the glass of port a serving girl had set within reach only moments before . " Troublesome news ? " inquired his friend and first mate , Alex Maxwell , from his post before the terrace doors . A cool , faintly salty breeze ruffled the gauzy curtains and eased the otherwise relentless heat of a summer afternoon in the Caribbean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan replied , after taking a sip of his wine , swallowing a good many contradictory feelings along with it . " My sister pleads with me to return to the fold and take up my place among His Majesty 's devoted adherents . She implies that , should I fail to heed this warning , our sorrowing and much-tormented sire shall wear out either the soles of his boots or my mother 's rugs , in his eternal and evidently ambulatory ruminations . " Alex grimaced . " Good God , man , " he said with some impatience , turning at last from his vigil at the window overlooking the sultry blue and gold waters of a sun-splashed , temperamental sea . " Ca n't you speak in simple English for once in your bloody life ? " Duncan arched one dark eyebrow . Language was , to him , a toy as well as a tool . He loved to explore its every nuance and corner , to exercise various words and combinations of words , to savor them upon his tongue , as he would a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired Maxwell  --  indeed , Duncan had entrusted Alex with his very life on more than one occasion  --  he would not have forsworn linguistic indulgence even for him . " Tell me , my friend  --  are you liverish today , or simply obstreperous in the extreme ? " Alex shoved the fingers of both hands into his butternut hair in a dramatic show of frustration . Like Duncan , Alex had lived one score and ten years ; they had been tutored together from the time they could toddle out of their separate nurseries . Both loved fast horses , witty women with sinful inclinations , and good rum , and their political views were , in the opinion of the Crown at least , equally subversive . Physically and emotionally , however , the two men were quite different  --  Alex being small and slightly built , with the ingenuous brown eyes of a fawn and , when vexed , all the subtlety of a bear batting at a swarm of wasps with both paws . Duncan 's temperament was cool and somewhat detached , and he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanged from a high branch without a scaffold . He prided himself on his self-control , whereas his enemies , no less than his friends , credited him with the tenacity and cunning of a winter-starved wolf . His hair was dark as jet , tied back at the nape of his neck with a narrow ribbon , and his eyes a deep and , so he 'd been told by grand ladies and whores alike , patently disturbing blue . His features , aristocratic from birth , had been hardened by the injustices he had both witnessed and suffered . These , given the troubled nature of the times , were many . " I 'm sorry , " Alex said with a weariness that disturbed Duncan greatly , turning at last to face his friend . " I do n't deny that I 've been foul-tempered in recent days . " " I trust there is a reason , " Duncan ventured in a quiet voice , folding Phillippa 's letter and placing it , with more tenderness than he would have confessed aloud , in the top drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those of the delicate gender , governed by the waxing and waning of the moon ? " " Oh , good Christ , " Alex bit out . " Sometimes you drive me mad . " " Be that as it may , " Duncan replied moderately , " I should still like to know what troubles you . We are yet friends , are we not ? Besides , a distracted man makes a poor leader , prone to grave errors of judgment . " He paused to utter a philosophical sigh . " If some comely wrench has addled your wits , the only prudent course of action , in my view , would be to relieve you of your duties straightaway , before someone in your command suffers the consequences of your preoccupation . " Alex 's fine-boned face seemed strained and shadowed as he met Duncan 's searching gaze , and his eyes reflected annoyance and something very like despair . " How long ? " he asked , in a rasping whisper . " How long must we endure this interminable war ? " Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex . There were times , he knew too well , when an ill-chosen word , intended to comfort , could be a man 's undoing instead . " Until it has been won , " he said tautly . The vast , sprawling house , dating back to the mid sixteen hundreds , seemed to breathe like a living creature , drawing in the first cool breezes since dawn and then expelling them in soft sighs . A goddess of white stone , with the sapphire sea writhing in unceasing worship at her feet , the palatial structure was a haven to Duncan , like the welcoming embrace of a tender-hearted woman . And it gave him solace , that place , as well as shelter . Alas , he was wedded to his ship , the Francesca , a swift and agile vessel brazenly named for his first lover , the disenchanted wife of a British infantry officer named Sheffield . While the lady had been spurned and sent back to England years ago , where she languished yet in a state of seedy disgrace , the gossips would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting , taking each opportunity for revenge as it presented itself . Duncan tightened his jaw , remembering even though he had schooled himself , through the years , to forget . He rotated his shoulders once , twice , as the tangle of old scars came alive on the flesh of his back , a searing tracery mapping another man 's hatred . He 'd been fifteen when Sheffield had ordered him bound to a post in a public square and whipped into blessed unconsciousness . " Sometimes I wonder , " Alex said , startling Duncan out of his bitter reverie , " whether 's it 's Mother England you 're at war with , or the lovely Francesca 's jealous husband . " It was by no means new , Alex 's propensity for divining the thoughts of others , and neither was Duncan 's reaction . " If you will be so kind , " he said curtly , " as to keep your fatuous and sentimental attempts at mystical wisdom to yourself , I shall be most appreciative . " Alex rolled his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , feigning a rapture of revelation . " We 'll capture Major Sheffield , truss him up like a Christmas goose so he ca n't cover his ears , and force him to endure the full range of your vocabulary ! He 'll be screaming for mercy inside half an hour . Despite the memories that had overtaken him , Duncan clasped his friend 's slightly stooped shoulder and laughed " Suppose I recited the whole of Dante 's Divine Comedy , he said . " In Italian , of course , " Alex agreed . " With footnotes . " Duncan withdrew his hand , and he knew his expression was as solemn as his voice . " If you want to beat your sword into a plowshare and spend the rest of your life tilling the earth , " he said , " I 'll understand , and not think less of you for it . " " I know , " Alex said . " And I am weary to the soul from this blasted war . I long to settle down , take a wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fight , the sons and daughters I hope to sire will stand mute before Parliament , as we do now . " He stopped and thrust his fingers through his hair , which was , as always , hopelessly mussed . " No , my friend , to paraphrase Mr. Franklin , if we do n't hang together , we shall surely hang separately . I will see the conflict through , to its end or mine , as God wills . " Duncan smiled just as the supper bell chimed , muffled and far off . " You are right , and so is Mr. Franklin . But I must take exception to one of your remarks  --  we rebels can hardly be accused of ' standing mute before Parliament . ' Our musket balls and cannon have been eloquent , I think . " Alex nodded and smiled . Again , the supper bell sounded . Insistently this time . Without speaking , the two men moved through the great house together , mindful now of their empty stomachs . They sat at the long table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , watching as the sun spilled over the dancing waters , melting in a dazzling spectacle of liquid light . A premonition touched Duncan 's spirit in that moment of terrible beauty , a warning or a promise , or perhaps both . For good or ill , he thought with resignation , something of significance was about to happen . " Welcome to Paradise ! " boomed a plump , middle-aged man with a crew cut and a Jack Nicholson smile , scrambling out of the van to greet each member of the small party of potential investors with a handshake . They stood on the grass-buckled tarmac , numb with exhaustion . " Do n't make any snap judgments , now , " he warned , before anyone could express a misgiving . " After all , it 's late and you 've had a long trip . Tomorrow , in the bright light of day , you 'll get a good look at the place , and , trust me , you 'll be impressed . " Phoebe did n't want to think about tomorrow , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall into bed . Jack was certainly right about one thing : It had been a long trip . After leaving Seattle , the plane had landed in Los Angeles , Houston , Kansas City , and Miami to pick up a dozen other weird characters , before proceeding to Condo Heaven . The motley crew boarded the minibus , yawning and murmuring , and despite her decision not to think , Phoebe found herself studying the others , each in their , turn , out of the corner of her eye . She 'd eat every postcard in the hotel gift shop , she thought , if a single one of them could land a mortgage to buy a fancy island hideaway , let alone scrape up the cash to buy one outright . The young couple who 'd boarded the plane in Kansas City were newlyweds , Phoebe figured , because they 'd been necking and staring into each other 's eyes for most of the flight . Some honeymoon . The man in the plaid pants and golf-club sweater had come along strictly for the ride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose batteries had finally run down , appeared to be the sort who 'd try anything as long as it was free . So what 's your excuse ? Phoebe asked herself . The hotel appeared suddenly out of the night , looming like smoke from some underground volcano or an enormous genie rising out of a lamp . Phoebe 's breath caught on a small , sharp gasp , and she sat bolt upright on the bus seat . A strange progression of emotions unfolded in her heart . Recognition , for one . And that was impossible , because she 'd never seen the building before . Nostalgia , for another . And a strange , sweet joy , as if she were coming home after a long and difficult journey . Underlying these emotions was a sense of poignant and wrenching loss , threaded through with sorrow . Tears sprang to Phoebe 's eyes . " Here 's the Eden Hotel now , folks , " the bus driver announced , with relentless goodwill . " It 's a grand old place . Belonged to a pirate once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before that , to a Dutch planter who raised indigo . " The minivan 's brakes squealed as it came to a sprightly stop under an ugly pink and green neon palm tree affixed to the wall . Two of the fronds were burned out . " Near as we could find out , the house was built in 1675 , or thereabouts . " Phoebe sniffled , dried her eyes with the back of one grubby hand , and got off the bus , staring at the shoddy hotel in mute grief . She 'd read a brief description of the place in Professor Benning 's book about Duncan Rourke ; that explained her complicated and overwrought reactions . The odd sensations lingered , though  --  Phoebe felt certain that she had known every nook and corner of this house once , had loved it when it was grand and elegant , and taken refuge within its walls when storms swept in from the sea . She had come home to a place she had never seen before , and she had arrived too late . 1780 Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roiled and grumbled on the horizon , shrouding the rolling waves of the deep and blotting out the light of the moon and stars . Duncan stood on the balcony outside his room , the wild wind playing in his hair and catching at the loose fabric of his shirt . The Francesca , always his first concern , was safe at anchor , in a sheltered cove some two miles down the shore . He would go to her all the same , and had no explanation to offer for delaying even this long , save the eerie certainty , imprinted in the marrow of his bones like a seal pressed into warm wax , that his life was about to change for all of time and eternity . Behind him , in the shadows , stood Old Woman . If she had any other name , Duncan had never heard it , though he considered her a friend of sorts and had heeded her advice on more than one occasion . The servants and other islanders feared and revered her , believing she had magical powers , a notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Although she spoke in a tranquil voice , he heard her distinctly over the noise . Beyond the terrace , earth and air and water met to spawn the tempest , and the birthing shrieks rode the wind . " It 's dangerous out there . " Still unsettled , and with regret , Duncan turned and obeyed Old Woman 's summons , closing the heavy shutters and then the French doors themselves . She stood in her regal robe , a seamless garment woven of some fabric Duncan did not recognize , holding a candelabra high , so that it shed a thin , shadow-streaked mantle of light over the both of them . " She 's on her way , " Old Woman said . " At last , she is coming to us . " " Who ? " Duncan demanded impatiently , taking the candelabra from the strong , wrinkled hand and starting toward the inner doors . " Mother England ? She wo n't be an amicable guest , I fear . No need to brew tea and bake sugar cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with easy strength , even though she weighed no more than a bird and the top of her grizzled head barely reached his breastbone . " Not the soldiers , with a whip for your back and noose for your neck , " she said firmly . " The woman . She comes from a world very far away and yet "  --  with ancient , withered fingers , she reached out and plucked at nothing  --  " so close that you might touch her . " Duncan felt a chill trickle down his spine , like a droplet from a northerly sea , but he was not a fanciful man , despite the strange , glorious , and unnamed fear stirring in the pit of his belly , and he put no stock in spells and enchantments , and invisible worlds near enough to touch or otherwise . " Superstitious rot , " he grumbled . Then , somewhat unchivalrously , he shoved the candelabra into her grasp and muttered , " Here . Take this and go on about your business , whatever it is . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavering , back into Duncan 's hand with an insolence none of the men under his command would have dared employ . It was no accident , either , he thought , when hot wax dripped onto his wrist in stinging splotches . " Old Woman see fine , " she said . " It is Mr. Duncan who has empty eyes . " In silence , he watched her move away into the shadows with sure and unhesitating steps . " Poppycock and bilge water , " Duncan said under his breath , but he found himself thinking , as he made his way down the wide , curving staircase , carrying the candelabra in one hand , of the odd , inexplicable noises he had heard in that house on rare occasions . Music , sounds he did not recognize from instruments he had never seen . Footsteps where no one walked . The muted laughter of invisible men and women , and the melodic chime of glass striking glass . He supposed he was going mad . He considered confiding his terrible secret to Alex but , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't sure his friend could be trusted , if confronted with such a confession , to show the proper degree of surprise . Phoebe 's room was roughly the size of a phone booth , and the bed looked as though it had been designed for a doll 's house , but she could hear and smell the sea , singing softly in the night . When the sun came up , she would have an ocean view , and the promise of that lifted her spirits . She took a shower under a spindly trickle of cool water , causing a rusty rumble in the pipes , brushed her teeth , pulled on an old T-shirt and a pair of cotton boxer shorts , and crawled into bed . Her last conscious thought was that the sheets were clean ; she sank into the depths of her mind and slept without dreaming . It was still dark when the music awakened her , its sad and beautiful strains twisting and turning through the profound silence like ribbons . A tiny muscle leaped , somewhere deep in Phoebe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She listened harder , groping for sounds she had heard earlier and barely noticed  --  the clamor of the old-fashioned elevator , creaking and rattling along its shaft , the shrill , metallic moan from the plumbing , the ponderous drip-drip-drip of the faucet in the bathroom  --  and heard only the swelling , heartbreaking eloquence of the music . Phoebe bit her lower lip and settled into her pillows , listening , reaching for memories that eluded her , but just barely . Her face was wet with tears she could not have explained , even to herself , and she wondered fancifully if the hotel might be haunted . The notes of the harpsichord surrounded her , caressed her , and finally lulled her back to sleep . The next time she woke up , tropical sunlight was spilling in through the window , full of dancing diamonds snatched from the sea , bathing her in a dazzle of gold and platinum . But the music had stopped . Phoebe stood on her bed , grasping the windowsill in both hands , and gazed out at the blue-green sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their splendor . It was worth it , she thought , as her soul stirred , painfully at first , like something long frozen . Here and there , in the uncharted regions . within , a dream trembled into wakefulness and reached for the light . Someone hammered at the door of her room , startling Phoebe so thoroughly that she nearly toppled off the bed . " What ? " she demanded , annoyed . " I got your costume , " answered an unfamiliar adolescent voice . " What costume ? " Phoebe asked , after wrenching open the door to find a teenage girl standing in the hallway , chewing gum and holding out a pile of cheap muslin . " There 's a party tonight , " the young woman said , orchestrating the words with a series of crisp snaps . " After you 've seen the condos and stuff , I mean . " She smiled , revealing enough braces to set off the metal detector in an airport . " My name 's Andrea , " she said wistfully . " I wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the mainland . It was kinda fun to dress up . " Phoebe frowned . This , she thought , must be the " gala affair " the brochure had mentioned . She decided to feign a headache that night and sneak out to walk on the beach . " Great , " she said without conviction . Andrea waggled her fingers . " Do n't worry , " she said . " You 'll make a great wench . " Phoebe stepped out into the hall , not caring , at that point , that she was wearing a T-shirt and boxer shorts . " Wait a second , " she called . " I 'll make a great what ? " " Wench , " Andrea replied blithely , without slowing her steps or looking back . " You know , one of those chicks who served rum and grog and sat on pirates ' laps . " Phoebe closed the door and leaned against it , holding the muslin dress against her bosom and gazing into the murky mirror on the opposite wall . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection .
