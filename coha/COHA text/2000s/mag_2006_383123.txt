The infinite jukebox is riding high-so why are many major acts offline ? // Salivating for " Strawberry Fields Forever " ? Dying for " Dazed and Confused " ? Forget the Net , because neither of those classics is available on iTunes , or any other legal download site . Sadly , the online jukebox is n't fully stocked yet-as artists like Led Zeppelin , the Beatles , and Garth Brooks have stayed defiantly out of the Internet universe . " We certainly have done our darndest to get them to go online , " says Rob Bennett of MSN Music . " Some are reluctant to embrace the technology .... Some only want to sell whole albums . " And there 's big-time money-and egos-involved , too . " To deny any economic calculations is disingenuous at best , " says Rhapsody.com 's Tim Quirk . " Artists have a lot of fear about online sales : " Will it cannibalize my CD sales ? ' ' " But as more and more classic rockers go digital-longtime holdout Bob Seger has just agreed to go online-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . Here 's a quick look at what 's going on with those stubborn stars . THE BEATLES Nothing about the Fab Four decision-making process is transparent , but one thing 's for sure : EMI Music wants their stuff on the Web . " Our talks are ongoing and we think it would be terrific , " says an EMI spokesperson . The Beatles ' own management company , Apple Corps Ltd. , declined to comment , but the group has always been slow to embrace new technology ( their catalog did n't hit CDs until 1987 ) and hardnosed at the negotiating table ( Beatles albums are rarely discounted ) . There 's also an outstanding lawsuit with Apple Computer to worry about ( the label sued the tech company in 2003 , claiming that it broke an agreement they had reached over the use of the " Apple " name in 1991 ) . Basically , it 'll happen only when all of these pieces-legal settlements , estates , cash-fall into the perfect groove . Odds for Change Do n't toss out your Revolver CD anytime soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 never materialized , and since Apple CEO Steve Jobs does n't seem interested in settling with Apple Corps in the near future , it 's gon na be a long and winding road for Beatles fans . METALLICA Back in 2000 , Metallica 's Lars Ulrich was one of the most vocal critics of Napster-the band famously sued the Internet music service for copyright infringement . Napster 's gone legit , but the Bay Area thrash titans still are n't available on that site ( or iTunes , for that matter ) . What gives ? " At this time , Metallica offer their music for download on an album-by-album basis from sites like MSN Music , " says a rep from the band 's management , citing artistic reasons for the no-singles edict . Odds for Change Excellent . " Metallica understand what their fans are asking for and we are working on addressing those needs , " says their rep . Our prediction : " Enter Sandman " will rock iTunes within a year . LED ZEPPELIN Back in 1971 , Led Zeppelin refused to release " Stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you download it now . Zeppelin 's management and label declined to comment , but industry experts suggest that they could be reluctant to jeopardize the quartet 's hefty royalty cut from their still-strong CD sales ( the group moved just under one million units in 2005 ) . " A lot of bands wo n't do anything without a big payment up front , " says David Pakman , CEO of Emusic.com . " But the digital industry does n't work that way . We 're not gon na pay advances , we 're just gon na sell your stuff and you 're gon na get a piece . " Odds for Change Yeah , right . " They want everyone else to be the guinea pigs first , " says Clark Benson of the Almighty Institute of Music Retail , a major-market research firm . In other words , the wait could be much longer than a John Bonham drum solo . RADIOHEAD Radiohead have ablog , but the Internet-savvy band wo n't let you download single songs . A rep for the art rockers ' label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albums represent a complete body of work and they want it to be sold as such . We support their decision . " Odds for Change Slim . Radiohead looks likely to remain an album-only purchase-since Jobs has always insisted that iTunes stay single-centric , there 'll be no " Fake Plastic Trees " for anyone with little white earbuds . GARTH BROOKS Brooks has been virtually retired since 2001 , and his reasons for staying offline are known only to his inner circle . " Garth does things Garth 's way , " says Benson . " He has complete control of everything . " Like many best-selling acts of his generation , Brooks could be worried that putting his music online would slow his steady CD sales ( 105 million and counting in the U.S. ) , a widely reported concern of the hat act . Odds for Change Do n't hold your breath . Brooks appears to be totally focused on physical CDs , so high-tech honky-tonkers are-for now-stuck in a low , low place .
