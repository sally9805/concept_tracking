THE LIGHT-BEAM RIDER // " I promise you four papers , " the young patent examiner wrote his friend . // The letter would turn out to bear some of the most significant tidings // in the history of science , but its momentous nature was masked by an // impish tone that was typical of its author . He had , after all , just // addressed his friend as " you frozen whale " and apologized for writing a // letter that was " inconsequential babble . " Only when he got around to // describing the papers , which he had produced during his spare time , did // he give some indication that he sensed their significance . // " The first deals with radiation and the energy properties of light and // is very revolutionary , " he explained . Yes , it was indeed revolutionary . // It argued that light could be regarded not just as a wave but also as a // stream of tiny particles called quanta . The implications that would // eventually arise from this theory  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spook him for the rest of his life . // " The second paper is a determination of the true sizes of atoms . " Even // though the very existence of atoms was still in dispute , this was the // most straightforward of the papers , which is why he chose it as the // safest bet for his latest attempt at a doctoral thesis . He was in the // process of revolutionizing physics , but he had been repeatedly thwarted // in his efforts to win an academic job or even get a doctoral degree , // which he hoped might get him promoted from a third- to a second-class // examiner at the patent office . // The third paper explained the jittery motion of microscopic particles in // liquid by using a statistical analysis of random collisions . In the // process , it established that atoms and molecules actually exist . // " The fourth paper is only a rough draft at this point , and is an // electrodynamics of moving bodies which employs a modification of the // theory of space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // inconsequential babble .

Out of // it would arise the best-known equation in all of physics : E=mc 2 . // Looking back at a century that will be remembered for its willingness to // break classical bonds , and looking ahead to an era that seeks to nurture // the creativity needed for scientific innovation , one person stands out // as a paramount icon of our age : the kindly refugee from oppression whose // wild halo of hair , twinkling eyes , engaging humanity , and extraordinary // brilliance made his face a symbol and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a locksmith blessed with imagination and guided by a // faith in the harmony of nature 's handiwork . His fascinating story , a // testament to the connection between creativity and freedom , reflects the // triumphs and tumults of the modern era. // Now that his archives have been completely opened , it is possible to // explore how the private side of Einstein  --  his nonconformist // personality , his instincts as a rebel , his curiosity , his passions and // detachments  --  intertwined with his political side and his scientific // side . Knowing about the man helps us understand the wellsprings of his // science , and vice versa . Character and imagination and creative genius // were all related , as if part of some unified field . // Despite his reputation for being aloof , he was in fact passionate in // both his personal and scientific pursuits . At college he fell madly in // love with the only woman in his physics class , a dark and intense // Serbian named Mileva Maric ? . They had an illegitimate daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sounding board for his // scientific ideas and helped to check the math in his papers , but // eventually their relationship disintegrated . Einstein offered her a // deal . He would win the Nobel Prize someday , he said ; if she gave him a // divorce , he would give her the prize money . She thought for a week and // accepted . Because his theories were so radical , it was seventeen years // after his miraculous outpouring from the patent office before he was // awarded the prize and she collected . // Einstein 's life and work reflected the disruption of societal // certainties and moral absolutes in the modernist atmosphere of the early // twentieth century . Imaginative nonconformity was in the air : Picasso , // Joyce , Freud , Stravinsky , Schoenberg , and others were breaking // conventional bonds . Charging this atmosphere was a conception of the // universe in which space and time and the properties of particles seemed // based on the vagaries of observations . // Einstein , however , was not truly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted by many , including some whose disdain was tinged by // anti-Semitism . Beneath all of his theories , including relativity , was a // quest for invariants , certainties , and absolutes . There was a harmonious // reality underlying the laws of the universe , Einstein felt , and the goal // of science was to discover it . // His quest began in 1895 , when as a 16-year-old he imagined what it would // be like to ride alongside a light beam . A decade later came his miracle // year , described in the letter above , which laid the foundations for the // two great advances of twentieth-century physics : relativity and quantum // theory . // A decade after that , in 1915 , he wrested from nature his crowning glory , // one of the most beautiful theories in all of science , the general theory // of relativity . As with the special theory , his thinking had evolved // through thought experiments . Imagine being in an enclosed elevator // accelerating up through space , he conjectured in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indistinguishable from the experience of // gravity . // Gravity , he figured , was a warping of space and time , and he came up // with the equations that describe how the dynamics of this curvature // result from the interplay between matter , motion , and energy . It can be // described by using another thought experiment . Picture what it would be // like to roll a bowling ball onto the two-dimensional surface of a // trampoline . Then roll some billiard balls . They move toward the bowling // ball not because it exerts some mysterious attraction but because of the // way it curves the trampoline fabric . Now imagine this happening in the // four-dimensional fabric of space and time . Okay , it 's not easy , but // that 's why we 're no Einstein and he was . // The exact midpoint of his career came a decade after that , in 1925 , and // it was a turning point . The quantum revolution he had helped to launch // was being transformed into a new mechanics that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last great contributions to // quantum mechanics that year but , simultaneously , began to resist it . He // would spend the next three decades , ending with some equations scribbled // while on his deathbed in 1955 , stubbornly criticizing what he regarded // as the incompleteness of quantum mechanics while attempting to subsume // it into a unified field theory . // Both during his thirty years as a revolutionary and his subsequent // thirty years as a resister , Einstein remained consistent in his // willingness to be a serenely amused loner who was comfortable not // conforming . Independent in his thinking , he was driven by an imagination // that broke from the confines of conventional wisdom . He was that odd // breed , a reverential rebel , and he was guided by a faith , which he wore // lightly and with a twinkle in his eye , in a God who would not play dice // by allowing things to happen by chance . // Einstein 's nonconformist streak was evident in his personality and // politics as well . Although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an individualist to be comfortable with excessive state control // or centralized authority . His impudent instincts , which served him so // well as a young scientist , made him allergic to nationalism , militarism , // and anything that smacked of a herd mentality . And until Hitler caused // him to revise his geopolitical equations , he was an instinctive pacifist // who celebrated resistance to war . // His tale encompasses the vast sweep of modern science , from the // infinitesimal to the infinite , from the emission of photons to the // expansion of the cosmos . A century after his great triumphs , we are // still living in Einstein 's universe , one defined on the macro scale by // his theory of relativity and on the micro scale by a quantum mechanics // that has proven durable even as it remains disconcerting . // His fingerprints are all over today 's technologies . Photoelectric cells // and lasers , nuclear power and fiber optics , space travel , and even // semiconductors all trace back to his theories . He signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible to build an atom // bomb , and the letters of his famed equation relating energy to mass // hover in our minds when we picture the resulting mushroom cloud . // Einstein 's launch into fame , which occurred when measurements made // during a 1919 eclipse confirmed his prediction of how much gravity bends // light , coincided with , and contributed to , the birth of a new celebrity // age . He became a scientific supernova and humanist icon , one of the most // famous faces on the planet . The public earnestly puzzled over his // theories , elevated him into a cult of genius , and canonized him as a // secular saint . // If he did not have that electrified halo of hair and those piercing // eyes , would he still have become science 's preeminent poster boy ? // Suppose , as a thought experiment , that he had looked like a Max Planck // or a Niels Bohr . Would he have remained in their reputational orbit , // that of a mere scientific genius ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantheon inhabited by Aristotle , Galileo , and Newton ? // The latter , I believe , is the case . His work had a very personal // character , a stamp that made it recognizably his , the way a Picasso is // recognizably a Picasso . He made imaginative leaps and discerned great // principles through thought experiments rather than by methodical // inductions based on experimental data . The theories that resulted were // at times astonishing , mysterious , and counterintuitive , yet they // contained notions that could capture the popular imagination : the // relativity of space and time , E=mc 2 , the bending of light beams , and the // warping of space . // Adding to his aura was his simple humanity . His inner security was // tempered by the humility that comes from being awed by nature . He could // be detached and aloof from those close to him , but toward mankind in // general he exuded a true kindness and gentle compassion . // Yet for all of his popular appeal and surface accessibility , Einstein // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something // that ordinary laymen could not comprehend , " the province of priest-like // experts , " in the words of Harvard professor Dudley Herschbach . It was // not always thus . Galileo and Newton were both great geniuses , but their // mechanical cause-and-effect explanation of the world was something that // most thoughtful folks could grasp . In the eighteenth century of Benjamin // Franklin and the nineteenth century of Thomas Edison , an educated person // could feel some familiarity with science and even dabble in it as an // amateur . // A popular feel for scientific endeavors should , if possible , be restored // given the needs of the twenty-first century . This does not mean that // every literature major should take a watered-down physics course or that // a corporate lawyer should stay abreast of quantum mechanics . Rather , it // means that an appreciation for the methods of science is a useful asset // for a responsible citizenry . What science teaches us , very // significantly , is the correlation between factual evidence and general // theories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , an appreciation for the glories of science is a joyful // trait for a good society . It helps us remain in touch with that // childlike ca-pacity for wonder , about such ordinary things as falling // apples and elevators , that characterizes Einstein and other great // theoretical physicists . // That is why studying Einstein can be worthwhile . Science is inspiring // and noble , and its pursuit an enchanting mission , as the sagas of its // heroes remind us . Near the end of his life , Einstein was asked by the // New York State Education Department what schools should emphasize . " In // teaching history , " he replied , " there should be extensive discussion of // personalities who benefited mankind through independence of character // and judgment . " Einstein fits into that category . // At a time when there is a new emphasis , in the face of global // competition , on science and math education , we should also note the // other part of Einstein 's answer . " Critical comments by students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Accumulation of material // should not stifle the student 's independence . " A society 's competitive // advantage will come not from how well its schools teach the // multiplication and periodic tables , but from how well they stimulate // imagination and creativity . // Therein lies the key , I think , to Einstein 's brilliance and the lessons // of his life . As a young student he never did well with rote learning . // And later , as a theorist , his success came not from the brute strength // of his mental processing power but from his imagination and creativity . // He could construct complex equations , but more important , he knew that // math is the language nature uses to describe her wonders . So he could // visualize how equations were reflected in realities  --  how the // electromagnetic field equations discovered by James Clerk Maxwell , for // example , would manifest themselves to a boy riding alongside a light // beam . As he once declared , " Imagination is more important than // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonconformity . " Long live // impudence ! " he exulted to the lover who would later become his wife . " It // is my guardian angel in this world . " Many years later , when others // thought that his reluctance to embrace quantum mechanics showed that he // had lost his edge , he lamented , " To punish me for my contempt for // authority , fate made me an authority myself . " // His success came from questioning conventional wisdom , challenging // authority , and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane . // This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for // free minds , free spirits , and free individuals . Tyranny repulsed him , // and he saw tolerance not simply as a sweet virtue but as a necessary // condition for a creative society . " It is important to foster // individuality , " he said , " for only the individual can produce the new // ideas . " // This outlook made Einstein a rebel with a reverence for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right blend of imagination and wisdom to // transform our understanding of the universe . These traits are just as // vital for this new century of globalization , in which our success will // depend on our creativity , as they were for the beginning of the // twentieth century , when Einstein helped usher in the modern age . // Copyright ? 2007 by Walter Isaacson // CHAPTER TWO // CHILDHOOD // 1879-1896 // The Swabian // He was slow in learning how to talk . " My parents were so worried , " he // later recalled , " that they consulted a doctor . " Even after he had begun // using words , sometime after the age of 2 , he developed a quirk that // prompted the family maid to dub him " der Depperte , " the dopey one , and // others in his family to label him as " almost backwards . " Whenever he had // something to say , he would try it out on himself , whispering it softly // until it sounded good enough to pronounce aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger sister recalled , " no matter how // routine , he repeated to himself softly , moving his lips . " It was all // very worrying , she said . " He had such difficulty with language that // those around him feared he would never learn . " // His slow development was combined with a cheeky rebelliousness toward // authority , which led one schoolmaster to send him packing and another to // amuse history by declaring that he would never amount to much . These // traits made Albert Einstein the patron saint of distracted school kids // everywhere . But they also helped to make him , or so he later surmised , // the most creative scientific genius of modern times . // His cocky contempt for authority led him to question received wisdom in // ways that well-trained acolytes in the academy never contemplated . And // as for his slow verbal development , he came to believe that it allowed // him to observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others took for // granted . " When I ask myself how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , it seemed to lie in the following // circumstance , " Einstein once explained . " The ordinary adult never // bothers his head about the problems of space and time . These are things // he has thought of as a child . But I developed so slowly that I began to // wonder about space and time only when I was already grown up . // Consequently , I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary // child would have . " // Einstein 's developmental problems have probably been exaggerated , // perhaps even by himself , for we have some letters from his adoring // grandparents saying that he was just as clever and endearing as every // grandchild is . But throughout his life , Einstein had a mild form of // echolalia , causing him to repeat phrases to himself , two or three times , // especially if they amused him . And he generally preferred to think in // pictures , most notably in famous thought experiments , such as imagining // watching lightning strikes from a moving train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I very rarely think in words at all , " // he later told a psychologist . " A thought comes , and I may try to express // it in words afterwards . " // Einstein was descended , on both parents ' sides , from Jewish tradesmen // and peddlers who had , for at least two centuries , made modest livings in // the rural villages of Swabia in southwestern Germany . With each // generation they had become , or at least so they thought , increasingly // assimilated into the German culture that they loved . Although Jewish by // cultural designation and kindred instinct , they displayed scant interest // in the religion or its rituals . // Einstein regularly dismissed the role that his heritage played in // shaping who he became . " Exploration of my ancestors , " he told a friend // late in life , " leads nowhere . " That 's not fully true . He was blessed by // being born into an independent-minded and intelligent family line that // valued education , and his life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by membership in a religious heritage that had a // distinctive intellectual tradition and a history of being both outsiders // and wanderers . Of course , the fact that he happened to be Jewish in // Germany in the early twentieth century made him more of an outsider , and // more of a wanderer , than he would have preferred  --  but that , too , // became integral to who he was and the role he would play in world // history . // Einstein 's father , Hermann , was born in 1847 in the Swabian village of // Buchau , whose thriving Jewish community was just beginning to enjoy the // right to practice any vocation . Hermann showed " a marked inclination for // mathematics , " and his family was able to send him seventy-five miles // north to Stuttgart for high school . But they could not afford to send // him to a university , most of which were closed to Jews in any event , so // he returned home to Buchau to go into trade . // A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural German Jews // into industrial centers during the late nineteenth century , Hermann and // his parents moved thirty-five miles away to the more prosperous town of // Ulm , which prophetically boasted as its motto " Ulmenses sunt // mathematici , " the people of Ulm are mathematicians. // There he became a partner in a cousin 's featherbed company . He was // " exceedingly friendly , mild and wise , " his son would recall . With a // gentleness that blurred into docility , Hermann was to prove inept as a // businessman and forever impractical in financial matters . But his // docility did make him well suited to be a genial family man and good // husband to a strong-willed woman . At age 29 , he married Pauline Koch , // eleven years his junior . // Pauline 's father , Julius Koch , had built a considerable fortune as a // grain dealer and purveyor to the royal W ? rttemberg court . Pauline // inherited his practicality , but she leavened his dour disposition with a // teasing wit edged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wounding ( traits she would pass on to her son ) . From all accounts , // the match between Hermann and Pauline was a happy one , with her strong // personality meshing " in complete harmony " with her husband 's passivity . // Their first child was born at 11:30 a.m. on Friday , March 14 , 1879 , in // Ulm , which had recently joined , along with the rest of Swabia , the new // German Reich . Initially , Pauline and Hermann had planned to name the boy // Abraham , after his paternal grandfather . But they came to feel , he later // said , that the name sounded " too Jewish . " So they kept the initial A and // named him Albert Einstein . // Munich // In 1880 , just a year after Albert 's birth , Hermann 's featherbed business // foundered and he was persuaded to move to Munich by his brother Jakob , // who had opened a gas and electrical supply company there . Jakob , the // youngest of five siblings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike Hermann , and he had qualified as an engineer . As they competed // for contracts to provide generators and electrical lighting to // municipalities in southern Germany , Jakob was in charge of the technical // side while Hermann provided a modicum of salesmanship skills plus , // perhaps more important , loans from his wife 's side of the family . // Pauline and Hermann had a second and final child , a daughter , in // November 1881 , who was named Maria but throughout her life used instead // the diminutive Maja . When Albert was shown his new sister for the first // time , he was led to believe that she was like a wonderful toy that he // would enjoy . His response was to look at her and exclaim , " Yes , but // where are the wheels ? " It may not have been the most perceptive of // questions , but it did show that during his third year his language // challenges did not prevent him from making some memorable comments . // Despite a few childhood squabbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate soul mate . // The Einsteins settled into a comfortable home with mature trees and an // elegant garden in a Munich suburb for what was to be , at least through // most of Albert 's childhood , a respectable bourgeois existence . Munich // had been architecturally burnished by mad King Ludwig II ( 1845-1886 ) and // boasted a profusion of churches , art galleries , and concert halls that // favored the works of resident Richard Wagner . In 1882 , just after the // Einsteins arrived , the city had about 300,000 residents , 85 percent of // them Catholics and 2 percent of them Jewish , and it was the host of the // first German electricity exhibition , at which electric lights were // introduced to the city streets . // Einstein 's back garden was often bustling with cousins and children . But // he shied from their boisterous games and instead " occupied himself with // quieter things . " One governess nicknamed him " Father Bore . " He was // generally a loner , a tendency he claimed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special sort of detachment that was interwoven with a // relish for camaraderie and intellectual companionship . " From the very // beginning he was inclined to separate himself from children his own age // and to engage in daydreaming and meditative musing , " according to // Philipp Frank , a longtime scientific colleague . // He liked to work on puzzles , erect complex structures with his toy // building set , play with a steam engine that his uncle gave him , and // build houses of cards . According to Maja , Einstein was able to construct // card structures as high as fourteen stories . Even discounting the // recollections of a star-struck younger sister , there was probably a lot // of truth to her claim that " persistence and tenacity were obviously // already part of his character . " // He was also , at least as a young child , prone to temper tantrums . " At // such moments his face would turn completely yellow , the tip of his nose // snow-white , and he was no longer in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at age 5 , he grabbed a chair and threw it at a tutor , who fled and // never returned . Maja 's head became the target of various hard objects . // " It takes a sound skull , " she later joked , " to be the sister of an // intellectual . " Unlike his persistence and tenacity , he eventually // outgrew his temper . // To use the language of psychologists , the young Einstein 's ability to // systemize ( identify the laws that govern a system ) was far greater than // his ability to empathize ( sense and care about what other humans are // feeling ) , which have led some to ask if he might have exhibited mild // symptoms of some developmental disorder . However , it is important to // note that , despite his aloof and occasionally rebellious manner , he did // have the ability to make close friends and to empathize both with // colleagues and humanity in general . // The great awakenings that happen in childhood are usually lost to // memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 or 5 that // would alter his life and be etched forever in his mind  --  and in the // history of science . He was sick in bed one day , and his father brought // him a compass . He later recalled being so excited as he examined its // mysterious powers that he trembled and grew cold . The fact that the // magnetic needle behaved as if influenced by some hidden force field , // rather than through the more familiar mechanical method involving touch // or contact , produced a sense of wonder that motivated him throughout his // life . " I can still remember  --  or at least I believe I can remember  --  // that this experience made a deep and lasting impression on me , " he wrote // on one of the many occasions he recounted the incident . " Something // deeply hidden had to be behind things . " // " It 's an iconic story , " Dennis Overbye noted in Einstein in Love , // " the young boy trembling to the invisible order behind chaotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie IQ , in which Einstein , played by // Walter Matthau , wears the compass around his neck , and it is the focus // of a children 's book , Rescuing Albert 's Compass , by Shulamith // Oppenheim , whose father-in-law heard the tale from Einstein in 1911. // After being mesmerized by the compass needle 's fealty to an unseen // field , Einstein would develop a lifelong devotion to field theories as a // way to describe nature . Field theories use mathematical quantities , such // as numbers or vectors or tensors , to describe how the conditions at any // point in space will affect matter or another field . For example , in a // gravitational or an electromagnetic field there are forces that could // act on a particle at any point , and the equations of a field theory // describe how these change as one moves through the region . The first // paragraph of his great 1905 paper on special relativity begins with a // consideration of the effects of electrical and magnetic fields ; his // theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravitational field ; and at the very end of his life he was doggedly // scribbling further field equations in the hope that they would form the // basis for a theory of everything . As the science historian Gerald Holton // has noted , Einstein regarded " the classical concept of the field the // greatest contribution to the scientific spirit . " // His mother , an accomplished pianist , also gave him a gift at around the // same time , one that likewise would last throughout his life . She // arranged for him to take violin lessons . At first he chafed at the // mechanical discipline of the instruction . But after being exposed to // Mozart 's sonatas , music became both magical and emotional to him . " I // believe that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty , " he said , // " at least for me. " // Soon he was playing Mozart duets , with his mother accompanying him on // the piano . " Mozart 's music is so pure and beautiful that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe itself , " he later told a // friend . " Of course , " he added in a remark that reflected his view of // math and physics as well as of Mozart , " like all great beauty , his music // was pure simplicity . " // Music was no mere diversion . On the contrary , it helped him think . // " Whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or faced a // difficult challenge in his work , " said his son Hans Albert , " he would // take refuge in music and that would solve all his difficulties . " The // violin thus proved useful during the years he lived alone in Berlin , // wrestling with general relativity . " He would often play his violin in // his kitchen late at night , improvising melodies while he pondered // complicated problems , " a friend recalled . " Then , suddenly , in the middle // of playing , he would announce excitedly , ' I 've got it ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem would have come to him in the // midst of music . " // His appreciation for music , and especially for Mozart , may have // reflected his feel for the harmony of the universe . As Alexander // Moszkowski , who wrote a biography of Einstein in 1920 based on // conversations with him , noted , " Music , Nature , and God became // intermingled in him in a complex of feeling , a moral unity , the trace of // which never vanished . " // Throughout his life , Albert Einstein would retain the intuition and the // awe of a child . He never lost his sense of wonder at the magic of // nature 's phenomena  --  magnetic fields , gravity , inertia , acceleration , // light beams  --  which grown-ups find so commonplace . He retained the // ability to hold two thoughts in his mind simultaneously , to be puzzled // when they conflicted , and to marvel when he could smell an underlying // unity . " People like you and me never grow old , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never cease to stand like curious children before the great // mystery into which we were born . " // School // In his later years , Einstein would tell an old joke about an agnostic // uncle , who was the only member of his family who went to synagogue . When // asked why he did so , the uncle would respond , " Ah , but you never know . " // Einstein 's parents , on the other hand , were " entirely irreligious " and // felt no compulsion to hedge their bets . They did not keep kosher or // attend synagogue , and his father referred to Jewish rituals as " ancient // superstitions. " // Consequently , when Albert turned 6 and had to go to school , his parents // did not care that there was no Jewish one near their home . Instead he // went to the large Catholic school in their neighborhood , the // Petersschule . As the only Jew among the seventy students in his class , // Einstein took the standard course in Catholic religion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so well in his Catholic studies // that he helped his classmates with theirs . // One day his teacher brought a large nail to the class . " The nails with // which Jesus was nailed to the cross looked like this , " he said . // Nevertheless , Einstein later said that he felt no discrimination from // the teachers . " The teachers were liberal and made no distinction based // on denominations , " he wrote . His fellow students , however , were a // different matter . " Among the children at the elementary school , // anti-Semitism was prevalent , " he recalled . // Being taunted on his walks to and from school based on " racial // characteristics about which the children were strangely aware " helped // reinforce the sense of being an outsider , which would stay with him his // entire life . " Physical attacks and insults on the way home from school // were frequent , but for the most part not too vicious . Nevertheless , they // were sufficient to consolidate , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outsider . " // When he turned 9 , Einstein moved up to a high school near the center of // Munich , the Luitpold Gymnasium , which was known as an enlightened // institution that emphasized math and science as well as Latin and Greek . // In addition , the school supplied a teacher to provide religious // instruction for him and other Jews . // Despite his parents ' secularism , or perhaps because of it , Einstein // rather suddenly developed a passionate zeal for Judaism . " He was so // fervent in his feelings that , on his own , he observed Jewish religious // strictures in every detail , " his sister recalled . He ate no pork , kept // kosher dietary laws , and obeyed the strictures of the Sabbath , all // rather difficult to do when the rest of his family had a lack of // interest bordering on disdain for such displays . He even composed his // own hymns for the glorification of God , which he sang to himself as he // walked home from school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he failed math as a // student , an assertion that is made , often accompanied by the phrase " as // everyone knows , " by scores of books and thousands of websites designed // to reassure underachieving students . It even made it into the famous // " Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! " newspaper column . // Alas , Einstein 's childhood offers history many savory ironies , but this // is not one of them . In 1935 , a rabbi in Princeton showed him a clipping // of the Ripley 's column with the headline " Greatest Living Mathematician // Failed in Mathematics . " Einstein laughed . " I never failed in // mathematics , " he replied , correctly . " Before I was fifteen I had // mastered differential and integral calculus . " // In fact , he was a wonderful student , at least intellectually . In primary // school , he was at the top of his class . " Yesterday Albert got his // grades , " his mother reported to an aunt when he was 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the gymnasium , he disliked the mechanical learning // of languages such as Latin and Greek , a problem exacerbated by what he // later said was his " bad memory for words and texts .

Years later , when // Einstein celebrated his fiftieth birthday and there were stories about // how poorly the great genius had fared at the gymnasium , the school 's // current principal made a point of publishing a letter revealing how good // his grades actually were . // As for math , far from being a failure , he was " far above the school // requirements . " By age 12 , his sister recalled , " he already had a // predilection for solving complicated problems in applied arithmetic , " // and he decided to see if he could jump ahead by learning geometry and // algebra on his own . His parents bought him the textbooks in advance so // that he could master them over summer vacation . Not only did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new theories by trying to prove // them on his own . " Play and playmates were forgotten , " she noted . " For // days on end he sat alone , immersed in the search for a solution , not // giving up before he had found it . " // His uncle Jakob Einstein , the engineer , introduced him to the joys of // algebra . " It 's a merry science , " he explained . " When the animal that we // are hunting can not be caught , we call it X temporarily and // continue to hunt until it is bagged . " He went on to give the boy even // more difficult challenges , Maja recalled , " with good-natured doubts // about his ability to solve them . " When Einstein triumphed , as he // invariably did , he " was overcome with great happiness and was already // then aware of the direction in which his talents were leading him . " // Among the concepts that Uncle Jakob threw at him was the Pythagorean // theorem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right triangle add // up to the square of the length of the hypotenuse ) . " After much effort I // succeeded in ' proving ' this theorem on the basis of the similarity of // triangles , " Einstein recalled . Once again he was thinking in pictures . // " It seemed to me ' evident ' that the relations of the sides of the // right-angled triangles would have to be completely determined by one of // the acute angles . " // Maja , with the pride of a younger sister , called Einstein 's Pythagorean // proof " an entirely original new one . " Although perhaps new to him , it is // hard to imagine that Einstein 's approach , which was surely similar to // the standard ones based on the proportionality of the sides of similar // triangles , was completely original . Nevertheless , it did show Einstein 's // youthful appreciation that elegant theorems can be derived from simple // axioms  --  and the fact that he was in little danger of failing math . " As // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was possible to find out // truth by reasoning alone , without the help of any outside experience , " // he told a reporter from a high school newspaper in Princeton years // later . " I became more and more convinced that nature could be understood // as a relatively simple mathematical structure . " // Einstein 's greatest intellectual stimulation came from a poor medical // student who used to dine with his family once a week . It was an old // Jewish custom to take in a needy religious scholar to share the Sabbath // meal ; the Einsteins modified the tradition by hosting instead a medical // student on Thursdays . His name was Max Talmud ( later changed to Talmey , // when he immigrated to the United States ) , and he began his weekly visits // when he was 21 and Einstein was 10 . " He was a pretty , dark-haired boy , " // remembered Talmud . " In all those years , I never saw him reading any // light literature . Nor did I ever see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his age . " // Talmud brought him science books , including a popular illustrated series // called People 's Books on Natural Science , " a work which I read // with breathless attention , " said Einstein . The twenty-one little volumes // were written by Aaron Bernstein , who stressed the interrelations between // biology and physics , and he reported in great detail the scientific // experiments being done at the time , especially in Germany . // In the opening section of the first volume , Bernstein dealt with the // speed of light , a topic that obviously fascinated him . Indeed , he // returned to it repeatedly in his subsequent volumes , including eleven // essays on the topic in volume 8 . Judging from the thought experiments // that Einstein later used in creating his theory of relativity , // Bernstein 's books appear to have been influential . // For example , Bernstein asked readers to imagine being on a speeding // train . If a bullet is shot through the window , it would seem that it was // shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the time // the bullet entered one window and exited the window on the other side . // Likewise , because of the speed of the earth through space , the same must // be true of light going through a telescope . What was amazing , said // Bernstein , was that experiments showed the same effect no matter how // fast the source of the light was moving . In a sentence that , because of // its relation to what Einstein would later famously conclude , seems to // have made an impression , Bernstein declared , " Since each kind of light // proves to be of exactly the same speed , the law of the speed of light // can well be called the most general of all of nature 's laws . " // In another volume , Bernstein took his young readers on an imaginary trip // through space . The mode of transport was the wave of an electric signal . // His books celebrated the joyful wonders of scientific investigation and // included such exuberant passages as this one written about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet Uranus : " Praised // be this science ! Praised be the men who do it ! And praised be the human // mind , which sees more sharply than does the human eye . " // Bernstein was , as Einstein would later be , eager to tie together all of // nature 's forces . For example , after discussing how all electromagnetic // phenomena , such as light , could be considered waves , he speculated that // the same may be true for gravity . A unity and simplicity , Bernstein // wrote , lay beneath all the concepts applied by our perceptions . Truth in // science consisted in discovering theories that described this underlying // reality . Einstein later recalled the revelation , and the realist // attitude , that this instilled in him as a young boy : " Out yonder there // was this huge world , which exists independently of us human beings and // which stands before us like a great , eternal riddle. " // Years later , when they met in New York during Einstein 's first visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrospect , of Bernstein 's work . // " A very good book , " he said . " It has exerted a great influence on my // whole development . " // Talmud also helped Einstein continue to explore the wonders of // mathematics by giving him a textbook on geometry two years before he was // scheduled to learn that subject in school . Later , Einstein would refer // to it as " the sacred little geometry book " and speak of it with awe : // " Here were assertions , as for example the intersection of the three // altitudes of a triangle in one point , which  --  though by no means // evident  --  could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any // doubt appeared to be out of the question . This lucidity and certainty // made an indescribable impression upon me . " Years later , in a lecture at // Oxford , Einstein noted , " If Euclid failed to kindle your youthful // enthusiasm , then you were not born to be a scientific thinker. " // When Talmud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // problems he had solved that week . Initially , Talmud was able to help // him , but he was soon surpassed by his pupil . " After a short time , a few // months , he had worked through the whole book , " Talmud recalled . " He // thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the flight of his // mathematical genius was so high that I could no longer follow . " // So the awed medical student moved on to introducing Einstein to // philosophy . " I recommended Kant to him , " he recalled . " At that time he // was still a child , only thirteen years old , yet Kant 's works , // incomprehensible to ordinary mortals , seemed to be clear to him . " Kant // became , for a while , Einstein 's favorite philosopher , and his // Critique of Pure Reason eventually led him to delve also into // David Hume , Ernst Mach , and the issue of what can be known about // reality . // Einstein 's exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , just as he would have been readying for a bar // mitzvah . Bernstein , in his popular science volumes , had reconciled // science with religious inclination . As he put it , " The religious // inclination lies in the dim consciousness that dwells in humans that all // nature , including the humans in it , is in no way an accidental game , but // a work of lawfulness , that there is a fundamental cause of all // existence . " // Einstein would later come close to these sentiments . But at the time , // his leap away from faith was a radical one . " Through the reading of // popular scientific books , I soon reached the conviction that much in the // stories of the Bible could not be true . The consequence was a positively // fanatic orgy of f reethinking coupled with the impression that youth is // intentionally being deceived by the state through lies ; it was a // crushing impression . " // As a result , Einstein avoided religious rituals for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aversion to the orthodox practice of // the Jewish or any traditional religion , as well as to attendance at // religious services , and this he has never lost , " his friend Philipp // Frank later noted . He did , however , retain from his childhood religious // phase a profound reverence for the harmony and beauty of what he called // the mind of God as it was expressed in the creation of the universe and // its laws . // Einstein 's rebellion against religious dogma had a profound effect on // his general outlook toward received wisdom . It inculcated an allergic // reaction against all forms of dogma and authority , which was to affect // both his politics and his science . " Suspicion against every kind of // authority grew out of this experience , an attitude which has never again // left me , " he later said . Indeed , it was this comfort with being a // nonconformist that would define both his science and his social thinking // for the rest of his life . // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grace that // was generally endearing , once he was accepted as a genius . But it did // not play so well when he was merely a sassy student at a Munich // gymnasium . " He was very uncomfortable in school , " according to his // sister . He found the style of teaching  --  rote drills , impatience with // questioning  --  to be repugnant . " The military tone of the school , the // systematic training in the worship of authority that was supposed to // accustom pupils at an early age to military discipline , was particularly // unpleasant . " // Even in Munich , where the Bavarian spirit engendered a less regimented // approach to life , this Prussian glorification of the military had taken // hold , and many of the children loved to play at being soldiers . When // troops would come by , accompanied by fifes and drums , kids would pour // into the streets to join the parade and march in lockstep . But not // Einstein . Watching such a display once , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't want to be one of those poor people , " he told his parents . // As Einstein later explained , " When a person can take pleasure in // marching in step to a piece of music it is enough to make me despise // him . He has been given his big brain only by mistake . " // The opposition he felt to all types of regimentation made his education // at the Munich gymnasium increasingly irksome and contentious . The // mechanical learning there , he complained , " seemed very much akin to the // methods of the Prussian army , where a mechanical discipline was achieved // by repeated execution of meaningless orders . " In later years , he would // liken his teachers to members of the military . " The teachers at the // elementary school seemed to me like drill sergeants , " he said , " and the // teachers at the gymnasium like lieutenants. " // He once asked C. P. Snow , the British writer and scientist , whether he // was familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ; it meant constraint , compulsion , obligation , coercion . Why ? In his // Munich school , Einstein answered , he had made his first strike against // Zwang , and it had helped define him ever since . // Skepticism and a resistance to received wisdom became a hallmark of his // life . As he proclaimed in a letter to a fatherly friend in 1901 , " A // foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth . " // Throughout the six decades of his scientific career , whether leading the // quantum revolution or later resisting it , this attitude helped shape // Einstein 's work . " His early suspicion of authority , which never wholly // left him , was to prove of decisive importance , " said Banesh Hoffmann , // who was a collaborator of Einstein 's in his later years . " Without it he // would not have been able to develop the powerful independence of mind // that gave him the courage to challenge established scientific beliefs // and thereby revolutionize physics . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German // " lieutenants " who taught him at his school . As a result , one of his // teachers proclaimed that his insolence made him unwelcome in class . When // Einstein insisted that he had committed no offense , the teacher replied , // " Yes , that is true , but you sit there in the back row and smile , and // your mere presence here spoils the respect of the class for me. " // Einstein 's discomfort spiraled toward depression , perhaps even close to // a nervous breakdown , when his father 's business suffered a sudden // reversal of fortune . The collapse was a precipitous one . During most of // Einstein 's school years , the Einstein brothers ' company had been a // success . In 1885 , it had two hundred employees and provided the first // electrical lights for Munich 's Oktoberfest . Over the next few years , it // won the contract to wire the community of Schwabing , a Munich suburb of // ten thousand people , using gas motors to drive twin dynanamos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six patents for // improvements in arc lamps , automatic circuit breakers , and electric // meters . The company was poised to rival Siemens and other power // companies then flourishing . To raise capital , the brothers mortgaged // their homes , borrowed more than 60,000 marks at 10 percent interest , and // went deeply in debt . // But in 1894 , when Einstein was 15 , the company went bust after it lost // competitions to light the central part of Munich and other locations . His // parents and sister , along with Uncle Jakob , moved to northern Italy  --  // first Milan and then the nearby town of Pavia  --  where the company 's // Italian partners thought there would be more fertile territory for a smaller // firm . Their elegant home was torn down by a developer to build an apartment // block . Einstein was left behind in Munich , at the house of a distant // relative , to finish his final three years of school . // It is not quite clear whether Einstein , in that sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Luitpold Gymnasium or was merely politely // encouraged to leave . Years later , he recalled that the teacher who had // declared that his " presence spoils the respect of the class for me " had // gone on to " express the wish that I leave the school . " An early book by a // member of his family said that it was his own decision . " Albert increasingly // resolved not to remain in Munich , and he worked out a plan . " // That plan involved getting a letter from the family doctor , Max Talmud 's // older brother , who certified that he was suffering from nervous exhaustion . // He used this to justify leaving the school at Christmas vacation in 1894 // and not returning . Instead , he took a train across the Alps to Italy and // informed his " alarmed " parents that he was never going back to Germany . // Instead , he promised , he would study on his own and attempt to gain // admission to a technical college in Zurich the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his decision to leave Germany . Had he // remained there until he was 17 , just over a year away , he would have been // required to join the army , a prospect that his sister said " he contemplated // with dread . " So , in addition to announcing that he would not go back to // Munich , he would soon ask for his father 's help in renouncing his German // citizenship . // Aarau // Einstein spent the spring and summer of 1895 living with his parents in // their Pavia apartment and helping at the family firm . In the process , he // was able to get a good feel for the workings of magnets , coils , and // generated electricity . Einstein 's work impressed his family . On one // occasion , Uncle Jakob was having problems with some calculations for a // new machine , so Einstein went to work on it . " After my assistant engineer // and I had been racking our brain for days , that young sprig had got the // whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend . " You // will hear of him yet . " // With his love of the sublime solitude found in the mountains , Einstein // hiked for days in the Alps and Apennines , including an excursion from Pavia // to Genoa to see his mother 's brother Julius Koch . Wherever he traveled in // northern Italy , he was delighted by the non-Germanic grace and " delicacy " // of the people . Their " naturalness " was a contrast to the " spiritually // broken and mechanically obedient automatons " of Germany , his sister // recalled . // Einstein had promised his family that he would study on his own to get // into the local technical college , the Zurich Polytechnic . So he bought // all three volumes of Jules Violle 's advanced physics text and copiously // noted his ideas in the margins . His work habits showed his ability to // concentrate , his sister recalled . " Even in a large , quite noisy group , // he could withdraw to the sofa , take pen and paper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lose himself so completely in // a problem that the conversation of many voices stimulated rather than // disturbed him . " // That summer , at age 16 , he wrote his first essay on theoretical physics , // which he titled " On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a // Magnetic Field . " The topic was important , for the notion of the ether // would play a critical role in Einstein 's career . At the time , scientists // conceived of light simply as a wave , and so they assumed that the universe // must contain an all-pervasive yet unseen substance that was doing the // rippling and thus propagating the waves , just as water was the medium // rippling up and down and thus propagating the waves in an ocean . They // dubbed this the ether , and Einstein ( at least for the time being ) went // along with the assumption . As he put it in his essay , " An electric current // sets the surrounding ether in a kind of momentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's textbook as well // as some of the reports in the popular science magazines about Heinrich // Hertz 's recent discoveries about electromagnetic waves . In it , Einstein // made suggestions for experiments that could explain " the magnetic field // formed around an electric current . " This would be interesting , he argued , // " because the exploration of the elastic state of the ether in this case // would permit us a look into the enigmatic nature of electric current . " // The high school dropout freely admitted that he was merely making a few // suggestions without knowing where they might lead . " As I was completely // lacking in materials that would have enabled me to delve into the subject // more deeply than by merely meditating about it , I beg you not to interpret // this circumstance as a mark of superficiality , " he wrote . // He sent the paper to his uncle Caesar Koch , a merchant in Belgium , who was // one of his favorite relatives and occasionally a financial patron . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be expected from such a young // fellow like myself , " Einstein confessed with a pretense of humility . He // added that his goal was to enroll the following fall at the Zurich // Polytechnic , but he was concerned that he was younger than the age // requirement . " I should be at least two years older . " // To help him get around the age requirement , a family friend wrote to the // director of the Polytechnic , asking for an exception . The tone of the letter // can be gleaned from the director 's response , which expressed skepticism // about admitting this " so-called ' child prodigy . ' " Nevertheless , Einstein // was granted permission to take the entrance exam , and he boarded the train // for Zurich in October 1895 " with a sense of well-founded diffidence. " // Not surprisingly , he easily passed the section of the exam in math and // science . But he failed to pass the general section , which included // sections on literature , French , zoology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics professor , Heinrich Weber , suggested that // Einstein stay in Zurich and audit his classes . Instead , Einstein // decided , on the advice of the college 's director , to spend a year // preparing at the cantonal school in the village of Aarau , twenty-five // miles to the west . // It was a perfect school for Einstein . The teaching // was based on the philosophy of a Swiss educational reformer of the early // nineteenth century , Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi , who believed in // encouraging students to visualize images . He also thought it important // to nurture the " inner dignity " and individuality of each child . Students // should be allowed to reach their own conclusions , Pestalozzi preached , // by using a series of steps that began with hands-on observations and // then proceeded to intuitions , conceptual thinking , and visual imagery . // It was even possible to learn  --  and truly understand  --  the laws of // math and physics that way . Rote drills , memorization , and force-fed // facts were avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually , " his sister // recalled , " more emphasis was placed on independent thought than on // punditry , and young people saw the teacher not as a figure of authority , // but , alongside the student , a man of distinct personality . " It was the // opposite of the German education that Einstein had hated . " When compared // to six years ' schooling at a German authoritarian gymnasium , " Einstein // later said , " it made me clearly realize how much superior an education // based on free action and personal responsibility is to one relying on // outward authority . " // The visual understanding of concepts , as stressed by Pestalozzi and his // followers in Aarau , became a significant aspect of Einstein 's genius . // " Visual understanding is the essential and only true means of teaching // how to judge things correctly , " Pestalozzi wrote , and " the learning of // numbers and language must be definitely subordinated. " // Not surprisingly , it was at this school that Einstein first engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest // scientific genius of his time : he tried to picture what it would be like // to ride alongside a light beam . " In Aarau I made my first rather childish // experiments in thinking that had a direct bearing on the Special Theory , " // he later told a friend . " If a person could run after a light wave with the // same speed as light , you would have a wave arrangement which could be // completely independent of time . Of course , such a thing is impossible . " // This type of visualized thought experiments  --  Gedankenexperiment //  --  became a hallmark of Einstein 's career . Over the years , he would picture // in his mind such things as lightning strikes and moving trains , // accelerating elevators and falling painters , two-dimensional blind beetles // crawling on curved branches , as well as a variety of contraptions designed // to pinpoint , at least in theory , the location and velocity of speeding // electrons. // While a student in Aarau , Einstein boarded with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long remain entwined in his life . There // was Jost Winteler , who taught history and Greek at the school ; his wife , // Rosa , soon known to Einstein as Mamerl , or Mama ; and their seven children . // Their daughter Marie would become Einstein 's first girlfriend . Another // daughter , Anna , would marry Einstein 's best friend , Michele Besso . And // their son Paul would marry Einstein 's beloved sister , Maja. // " Papa " Jost Winteler was a liberal who shared Einstein 's allergy // to German militarism and to nationalism in general . His edgy honesty and // political idealism helped to shape Einstein 's social philosophy . Like // his mentor , Einstein would become a supporter of world federalism , // internationalism , pacifism , and democratic socialism , with a strong // devotion to individual liberty and freedom of expression . // More important , in the warm embrace of the Winteler family , Einstein became // more secure and personable . Even though he still fancied himself a // loner , the Wintelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He had a great sense of humor and at times could laugh // heartily , " recalled daughter Anna . In the evenings he would sometimes // study , " but more often he would sit with the family around the table . " // Einstein had developed into a head-turning teenager who possessed , in // the words of one woman who knew him , " masculine good looks of the type // that played havoc at the turn of the century . " He had wavy dark hair , // expressive eyes , a high forehead , and jaunty demeanor . " The lower half // of his face might have belonged to a sensualist who found plenty of // reasons to love life . " // One of his schoolmates , Hans Byland , later wrote a striking description // of " the impudent Swabian " who made such a lasting impression . " Sure of // himself , his gray felt hat pushed back on his thick , black hair , he strode // energetically up and down in the rapid , I might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole world in itself . Nothing escaped the // sharp gaze of the large bright brown eyes . Whoever approached him was // captivated by his superior personality . A mocking curl of his fleshy mouth // with its protruding lower lip did not encourage Philistines to fraternize // with him . " // Most notably , Byland added , young Einstein had a sassy , sometimes // intimidating wit . " He confronted the world spirit as a laughing // philosopher , and his witty sarcasm mercilessly castigated all vanity and // artificiality . " // Einstein fell in love with Marie Winteler at the end of 1895 , just a few // months after he moved in with her parents . She had just completed teacher // training college and was living at home while waiting to take a job in a // nearby village . She was just turning 18 , he was still 16 . The romance // thrilled both families . Albert and Marie sent New Year 's greetings to // his mother ; she replied warmly , " Your little letter , dear Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following April , when he was back home in Pavia for spring break , // Einstein wrote Marie his first known love letter : // Beloved sweetheart ! // Many , many thanks sweetheart for your charming little letter , which made // me endlessly happy . It was so wonderful to be able to press to one 's // heart such a bit of paper which two so dear little eyes have lovingly // beheld and on which the dainty little hands have charmingly glided back // and forth . I was now made to realize , my little angel , the meaning of // homesickness and pining . But love brings much happiness  --  much more so // than pining brings pain ... // My mother has also taken you to her heart , even though she does not know // you ; I only let her read two of your charming little letters . And she // always laughs at me because I am no longer attracted to the girls who // were supposed to have enchanted me so much in the past . You mean more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // To which his mother penned a postscript : " Without having read this letter , // I send you cordial greetings ! " // Although he enjoyed the school in Aarau , Einstein turned out to be an // uneven student . His admission report noted that he needed to do remedial // work in chemistry and had " great gaps " in his knowledge of French . By // midyear , he still was required to " continue with private lessons in French // &amp; chemistry , " and " the protest in French remains in effect . " His father // was sanguine when Jost Winteler sent him the midyear report . " Not all its // parts fulfill my wishes and expectations , " he wrote , " but with Albert I // got used to finding mediocre grades along with very good ones , and I am // therefore not disconsolate about them . " // Music continued to be a passion . There were nine violinists in his class , // and their teacher noted that they suffered from " some stiffness in bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singled out for praise : " One // student , by the name of Einstein , even sparkled by rendering an adagio // from a Beethoven sonata with deep understanding . " At a concert in the // local church , Einstein was chosen to play first violin in a piece by // Bach . His " enchanting tone and incomparable rhythm " awed the second // violinist , who asked , " Do you count the beats ? " Einstein replied , // " Heavens no , it 's in my blood . " // His classmate Byland recalled Einstein playing a Mozart sonata with such // passion  --  " What fire there was in his playing ! "  --  that it seemed like // hearing the composer for the first time . Listening to him , Byland realized // that Einstein 's wisecracking , sarcastic exterior was a shell around a // softer inner soul . " He was one of those split personalities who know how // to protect , with a prickly exterior , the delicate realm of their intense // personal life . " // Einstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere made him want to renounce his citizenship in that country . // This was reinforced by Jost Winteler , who disdained all forms of // nationalism and instilled in Einstein the belief that people should // consider themselves citizens of the world . So he asked his father to // help him drop his German citizenship . The release came through in // January 1896 , and for the time being he was stateless. // He also that year became a person without a religious affiliation . In // the application to renounce his German citizenship , his father had // written , presumably at Albert 's request , " no religious denomination . " It // was a statement Albert would also make when applying for Zurich residency // a few years later , and on various occasions over the ensuing two decades . // His rebellion from his childhood fling with ardent Judaism , coupled with // his feelings of detachment from Munich 's Jews , had alienated him from his // heritage . " The religion of the fathers , as I encountered it in Munich // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than // attracted me , " he later explained to a Jewish historian . " The Jewish // bourgeois circles that I came to know in my younger years , with their // affluence and lack of a sense of community , offered me nothing that // seemed to be of value . " // Later in life , beginning with his exposure to virulent anti-Semitism in // the 1920s , Einstein would begin to reconnect with his Jewish identity . // " There is nothing in me that can be described as a ' Jewish faith , ' " he // said , " however I am happy to be a member of the Jewish people . " Later he // would make the same point in more colorful ways . " The Jew who abandons his // faith , " he once said , " is in a similar position to a snail that abandons // his shell . He is still a snail . " // His renunciation of Judaism in 1896 should , therefore , be seen not as a // clean break but as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity . " At that time I would not even have understood // what leaving Judaism could possibly mean , " he wrote a friend the year // before he died . " But I was fully aware of my Jewish origin , even though // the full significance of belonging to Jewry was not realized by me until // later . " // Einstein ended his year at the Aarau school in a manner that would have // seemed impressive for anyone except one of history 's great geniuses , // scoring the second highest grades in his class . ( Alas , the name of the // boy who bested Einstein is lost to history . ) On a 1 to 6 scale , with 6 // being the highest , he scored a 5 or 6 in all of his science and math // courses as well as in history and Italian . His lowest grade was a 3 , in // French . // That qualified him to take a series of exams , written and oral , that // would permit him , if he passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German exam , he did a perfunctory outline of a Goethe play and scored a 5. // In math , he made a careless mistake , calling a number " imaginary " when he // meant " irrational , " but still got a top grade . In physics , he arrived late // and left early , completing the two-hour test in an hour and fifteen // minutes ; he got the top grade . Altogether , he ended up with a 5.5 , the best // grade among the nine students taking the exams . // The one section on which he did poorly was French . But his three-paragraph // essay was , to those of us today , the most interesting part of all of his // exams . The topic was " Mes Projets d'avenir , " my plans for the future . // Although the French was not memorable , the personal insights were : // If I am lucky and pass my exams , I will enroll in the Zurich Polytechnic . // I will stay there four years to study mathematics and physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fields of science , opting for the // theoretical part of these sciences . // Here are the reasons that have led me to this plan . They are , most of // all , my personal talent for abstract and mathematical thinking ... My // desires have also led me to the same decision . That is quite natural ; // everybody desires to do that for which he has a talent . Besides , I am // attracted by the independence offered by the profession of science . // In the summer of 1896 , the Einstein brothers ' electrical business again // failed , this time because they bungled getting the necessary water rights // to build a hydroelectric system in Pavia . The partnership was dissolved // in a friendly fashion , and Jakob joined a large firm as an engineer .

" I was originally supposed to // become an engineer , " he later wrote a friend , " but the thought of having // to expend my creative energy on things that make practical everyday life // even more refined , with a bleak capital gain as the goal , was unbearable // to me . Thinking for its own sake , like music ! " And thus he headed off to // the Zurich Polytechnic . //
