Section : EMPLOYEE OPTIMIZATION <p> Spurred by European takeovers and other forms of privatization stressing efficiency and knowledge , U.S. water/wastewater companies are expanding training programs to fill gaps caused by plant closings , cost-cutting and downsizing . Whether they grow their training programs in-house , use outside vendors or a combination of the two , executives say they are able to do a better job filling skill shortages that ensure safer and more efficient plants and that comply with increasingly stringent government regulation . <p> Municipalities across the United States are having employees trained . " We 're constantly training , " said Chris Heelis , safety officer , Littleton Englewood Wastewater Treatment Plant in Colorado , whose agency has hired National Technology Transfer , Inc . ( NTT ) , an Englewood ( Colo. ) - based training organization that conducts courses onsite . <p> Out in the East , Massachusetts Water Resource Authority has enrolled most employees in 26 different training courses to combat many early retirements . <p> In addition , there appears to be no end in sight for this training wave . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wastewater Treatment Plant , reports that management already has approved a substantial training budget for fiscal 2003 . Training to Increase Safety <p> Safety continues to be a major driver of training programs , according to John Kolak , division manager for Compliance &; Business Systems at NTT . " Skills that create a safe workplace are the same skills that create an efficient , reliable , smoothly running plant , " he said . <p> " Our industry is hazardous , so we safety train people , " said Heelis , himself a certified CPR instructor . <p> Flagstaff 's Hernandez , and George H. Denhard , manager of technical training at Massachusetts Water Resource Authority ( MWRA ) , stress safety by offering confined space entry and lockout-tagout training . In addition , MWRA offers air quality and incident command systems courses . All new and current employees are required to participate in training . Denhard promotes employee-to-employee safety by training all employees on diversity violence and worker protection . Safety training , he states , is all about preventing injuries and avoiding liability problems . <p> While safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government compliance , plant operators also stress specific skill training in technology , government compliance , prevention of outages and downtime and coping with heavy service demand . They also are offering more cross-training to help fill the gaps caused by early retirement , hiring freezes and cost-cutting . Enhancing Technical Skills <p> " We 're getting new technology equipment from the U.K. for tertiary nitrogen removal , and now we need to get the training on operating it , " said Heelis of Littleton-Englewood . Daniel Martin , engineering manager , Onondaga County Water Authority , Syracuse , N.Y. , took a programmable logic controller course and is calling for radio communications and fiber optics training at his facility . <p> MWRA offers a leadership training program , supervisory skills for technical professionals to senior and middle managers . Flagstaff 's Hernandez says his facility has provided skills training to him and an electrician colleague on pump maintenance , electrical and programmable controllers . As the 20-year-old Flagstaff facility upgrades its monitoring and level checking technology , employees will get training in basic electronics , calibrating instrumentation , computer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When MWRA needed electricians , plumbers and HVAC people , they developed an in-house apprenticeship program incorporating training . It included courses on pumps , pumping , chemical feeding , chemical safe practices , valves and electricity MWRA offers an in-house computer and outsourced communications training programs for clerical and support staff . Since most required training tends to be technical and varied , MWRA relies on outsourcing providers for expertise . <p> According to Denhard , a plant opening created a need for licensing and certifications . He developed an **38;523;TOOLONG program and received state and union approval . Therefore , he was able to adjust the training to specific local needs . Flagstaff 's Hernandez also recognizes a need to make training more attuned to plant needs . Currently , training comes from Northern Arizona University , so it is not keyed to his specific site . Meeting Requirements <p> Regulatory compliance also is stimulating training . OSHA regulations govern water/wastewater plants and mandate training and engineering controls of their operation . While regulations are generic , interpretations of the regulations also must be considered when determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convergence between trainers ' goals and governmental regulatory agencies ' goals , as both seek to enhance workplace safety and employee operating knowledge . Thus , training managers are focusing on achieving regulatory compliance . <p> " Compliance often requires annual , effective refresher training , " Kolak said . Employees must demonstrate hands-on proficiency to accomplish a task safely This is why water/wastewater training is hands-on . Regulations are a force behind increasing training , according to Martin of Onondaga County Water . Employees and their employers are recognized for additional training . <p> Since some of the basic regulations are more than seven years old , the industry has had time to become familiar with their requirements , train current employees and enter a phase of refresher training for all but new hires . OSHA regulations require that management and employees identify hazards and are familiar with equipment and systems to protect themselves from injury and illness . Regulations mandate training assuring safety in the workplace and retraining for process changes and new tasks . <p> The goal of Heelis is to meet all OSHA requirements  --  particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSHA does not regulate the MWRA facilities , Denhard said his organization has adopted OSHA standards . <p> OSHA is not the only regulatory game in town . Trainees at MWRA must meet state-mandated requirements for certification or licensing in drinking water/wastewater treatment , hazardous waste site work , harbor chemicals off-loading and electrical work . A state " right to know " law also requires informing employees about workplace hazards . The training program handles compliance with this law . <p> Colorado requirements make Heelis certify his operations staff . This is accomplished through training . Flagstaff 's plant is governed by regulations of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality EPA training also is important . Heelis is proud of his plant 's EPA awards . In addition , many local district attorneys are leveling criminal penalties against those organizations with egregious violations of health and safety standards . Training as Prevention <p> The worst thing that can happen at a water/wastewater plant is to stop running . " Training helps prevent outages and downtime , " Kolak said . " It combats outages resulting from human error and helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things safely , he believes , provides employees with additional tools and more creative ways to use them to keep service up and running . <p> Martin and Hernandez say increased training helps water/wastewater facilities handle problems caused by outages and downtime . Martin believes in training people at the site where a breakdown might occur . <p> " The closer you are to what needs fixing , " Martin said , " the easier it is to fix . " <p> Hernandez believes training will help his people avoid or shorten service interruptions by troubleshooting and recognizing potential problems . <p> According to Heelis , Littleton has an emergency response plan as well as back-up equipment for power outages and other catastrophic incidents . All employees are tested under that plan so the plant is prepared . MWRA is instituting an in-house reliability-centered maintenance-training program for group leaders and maintenance people . Measurable increases in productivity and reliability are expected from the preventive/predictive maintenance-based program . Cross Training <p> In a water/wastewater industry characterized by resizing , downsizing , layoffs and turnover , cross training is broadly used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ( e.g. , teaching a mechanic to do electrical work ) can help water/wastewater facilities become more efficient , but cross training is a double-edged sword . It can promote safety or compromise it . Assigning work that is too complex for a cross-trained person to complete safely is a danger . The challenge is to know when a cross-trained person can safely perform a task and when a specialist must be used . <p> Denhard of MWRA will soon learn what doing more with less means . The state has offered early retirement to 150 , or 10 percent , of the Authority 's 1,500 employees . He expects 130 or more retirements by operators , chief operators , maintenance , electricians , area supervisors , white collar and others . <p> Kolak sees value in cross training operations and maintenance people and a way for the MWRA to survive with fewer workers . MWRA management reached an accord with the unions for a productivity improvement program allowing operator-maintenance cross training . Operators attend valve , lubrication and pump classes . Maintenance people take introduction to water/wastewater systems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important function where cross training is needed . Functions include temperature and sludge depth checks , taking reads , changing chlorine and SO 2 tanks and doing light maintenance such as greasing and oiling . <p> Onondaga County Water 's Martin and Flagstaff 's Hernandez use cross training to develop a broadly skilled worker . Hernandez 's facility is developing skill-based pay to offset privatization , reemphasizing cross training . At Littleton Englewood all employees are cross trained on safety , specific skills , wastewater treatment , chemistry , administration , lab and facility goals to gain knowledge needed to maintain an award-winning record . Training : A Management Tool <p> The water/wastewater industry has turned to training as a solution to a skilled personnel crisis created by privatization and ownership changes . Training managers seek a safer , more regulation-compliant industry with facilities running smoothly and reliably Outsourcing is a strategy for organizations that do not want huge in-house training staffs . Tomorrow 's successful and profitable water/wastewater facilities will be those that learn to use the new investment in training most effectively to meet the challenges of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 865 on the reader service card . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : While safety training can prevent accidents , plant breakdowns and lapses in government compliance , plant operators also stress specific skill training in technology government compliance , prevention of outages and downtime and coping with heavy service demand . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : OSHA regulations require that management and employees identify hazards and are familiar with equipment and systems to protect themselves from injury and illness . <p>
