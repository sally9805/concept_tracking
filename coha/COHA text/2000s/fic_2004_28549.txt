Chapter One " I 'M SORRY , Ali , but I 'm not ready to make such a big decision . " Laura McCloud sat at the kitchen table across from her sister the morning after their mother 's funeral , sipping coffee and nibbling a piece of dry toast . Her Boston home had overflowed with visitors the evening before , but she and Ali were alone now . The house was almost back in order . Leftovers filled the refrigerator shelves - not that she had much of an appetite . " But you know how much we 'd love for you to join us in Atlanta , " continued Alison . " Charles especially wants you to know that the invitation comes from him , too . And the kids would adore having their Aunt Laura close by . " " I do know it , and I love you all for it , but - " " And we have fabulous medical centers , too , " interrupted Alison . " As good as here . Not that you have anything to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the knowledge that there were no guarantees . " I 'm not concerned about finding medical care . It 's just that I have another idea . " " You do ? What ? " " Remember Pilgrim Cove ? Remember the beautiful beach ? " Laura watched her sister 's eyes widen and a grin light up her face . " Do I remember ? Of course I remember . What great summers we had . So , what 's your idea ? A summer vacation at the beach ? " " Not exactly , " replied Laura . " I 'm not going to wait that long . " " You 're going to the beach in the middle of winter ? " Alison asked in disbelief as she hugged herself . " Brr . Not me . " Laura laughed at her sister 's antics . They 'd always gotten along well , and Laura had really missed Alison when she 'd left Boston . Suddenly Laura had to blink back tears . Alison was now her only family . " I 'll think about what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and ... I need some time . Time for myself . " Alison 's hand reached for hers . " I 'll support any decision you make , sis , but are you sure you really want to be alone ? " " With the sand and the ocean and my work ... do n't worry , Ali . I 'll be very busy . " " Yeah , yeah . The sand will blow in your eyes , the ocean will crash against the seawall and the ferry wo n't run . So much for winter at the beach ! " Laura smiled . " I 'll wait until next month . March should be somewhat better . I wonder what Pilgrim Cove is like during the off-season . At least the rent should be cheaper . " " Wait a minute . Why are you concerned about rent ? A few dollars one way or another for a week 's vacation should n't make a difference . " " I 'm thinking about more than a week , " Laura said in a slow , deliberate tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Memorial Day . A small house might not be too expensive , not too hard to keep up , but I 'd want it right on the beach . " She stood as the image crystallized in her mind . " I need a change , a complete change of scene . And I need it now . Fighting with the weather will be much easier than fighting for Mom 's life and my own . " She reached up and tousled her short blond curls . " Look at me , Alison . Look at these ringlets . I 'm delighted to have hair again , but I do n't recognize myself when I pass a mirror . Where 's the sleek blunt cut that was so easy to manage ? " " You 're adorable in those curls ! In fact , you look wonderful , Laura , just wonderful . " Laura could hear the passion in her sister 's voice . " Donald did n't think so , " she responded . " Donald Crawford was a jerk ! " Laura shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was just human . He had a girlfriend with a huge responsibility to an ill mother - and he handled that - but my getting sick was just too much . He was n't prepared for all the emotional turmoil . Who can blame him ? " " I can , " replied Alison . " Be fair , " said Laura . " We were n't engaged . He did n't owe me anything . " " He was n't worthy of you ! " Alison insisted . " You 're the most outstanding person , the most beautiful , wonderful woman ... " " You 're hardly objective . " Laura laughed . " But can you really blame Don for wanting a normal life ? What man would n't have second thoughts when he heard the words ' breast cancer ' ? " " A man who loves you , " came the quick reply . " Well , I 'm not going to count on that happening , " said Laura in an even tone . " So I 'll have lots of time and energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " I 'm thirty-three . It 's now or never . And you heard my agent last night . " Work is therapy , Laura , " " she mimicked Norman Cohen 's low voice . She relaxed in her chair . " Norman is a dear friend as well as a businessman . And he 's got some radio ads lined up for me . " Alison would have protested again , but Laura held up her hand . " I 'm not discussing men anymore , Ali . I 'm not sure there 's a man in the world who could look past this . Anyway , it 's too soon . All I can do is take one day at a time . Capisce ? " " Sure , " Alison replied . " I understand , but I do n't have to like it . I love you and I want you to have ... " " I know , " Laura said in a hoarse voice . " You want me to have everything you have ... loving husband , healthy children ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is going to happen , however , is a nice long stay in Pilgrim Cove . " Alison remained quiet for a long moment . " I recognize that expression and that tone , " she finally said . " You 've made up your mind . But my invitation remains open - will always remain open . " Laura looked at her sister 's face , at the sincerity clearly written there . " Thanks , Ali , thanks a lot . But I 've got to figure it out my own way . " She reached for the phone . " I 'm calling Bartholomew Quinn , the man who arranged the summer rentals when we were kids . I remember going with Daddy to Mr. Quinn 's real estate office . And I remember him . A head of thick white hair . " " White ? And that was how many years ago ? Close to twenty ? He might be dead by now ! " " Hope not . " She picked up the receiver and dialed directory assistance .
