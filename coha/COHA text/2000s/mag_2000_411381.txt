A win and a wreck early in the season put the 99 car up high and down low . // There 's no rest for the weary in the quest for NASCAR 's Winston Cup . And truth be told , almost everybody is weary during the early part of each 34 race season . That certainly includes driver Jeff Burton , crew chief Frankie Stoddard and the entire No. 99 Exide Batteries/POPULAR MECHANICS Ford Taurus team owned by Jack Roush . Blame it on the schedule maker . Unlike every other sport , Winston Cup racing opens each season with its richest , most prestigious and most visible events . Teams spend 10 pressure packed days in Daytona Beach , Fla. , preparing for the Daytona 500 and its two support races . The relentless grind and 12-hour days paid off for Burton , who finished second behind fellow Ford driver Dale Jarret in the $9 million race . But instead of getting a well-deserved break , the team was back at work the nest weekend for a 400-miler at the North Carolina Speedway near Rockingham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Las Vegas Motor Speedway , then a 500miler at Atlanta Motor Speedway and a 400-miler at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina . There would be four more races between Darlington and Easter Sunday on April 23 , the first of the season 's five open dates . By then , the Exide/PM team will have spent 10 consecutive weekends on the road , raced almost 4000 miles in nine states and worked untold thousands of man hours in its North Carolina headquarters and in speedway garage areas . No rest for the weary , indeed . The early part of 2000 brought mixed results for Burton , Stoddard , Roush and their crew . Because of the Feb. 27 DuraLube/Kmart 400 at the North Carolina Speedway at Rockingham , the team did n't get much time to enjoy its second-place finish at Daytona Beach . But the team went to The Rock with confidence born of Burton 's 1999 finishes of fourth and first at the 1.017-mile track . All told , his resume at Rockingham showed one victory and five other top five finishes since 1995 . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led a lap shortly after halfway , but faded to a disappointing 32nd when his engine lost power in the final laps . He managed to motor along until the end , finishing six laps behind winner Bobby Labonte after having a lead-lap car and a potential winner for the better part of the afternoon . " We broke a valve or something , which is pretty unusual for this team , " Burton said . " Usually , we do n't have any engine problems . It 's a tough way to start the season , especially after doing so well last weekend . We had a car capable of winning , but only if we 'd made the right adjustments . It was one of those off days that we do n't have very often . " Las Vegas the following weekend would prove far better for Burtonin every way . He returned for the CarsDirect.com 400 as the defending champion and co-favorite with teammate Mark Martin at the 1.5mile track . He got his weekend off to a good start by qualifying 11th for the Winston Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race ahead of Martin . Sunday 's 400 was one of those strange races that almost defies description . Burton came up through traffic to lead laps 60 through 94 , and then led laps 104 through 111 after a round of pitstops . Martin powered by to lead laps 112 through 135 even as the skies grew darker and the possibility of rain turned into a full-blown threat . Almost certain the race would n't reach its full 267-lap distance , Burton went past Martin at lap 136 and opened a slight lead . For some inexplicable reason , Martin did n't seem concerned enough about the weather to put up much of a fight when Burton caught him . Photograph A blown tire put the No. 99 car into the wall earl and out of the race in Atlanta . // The rain everyone expected finally struck several laps later . Officials had no choice but to slow the pace , then stop the race after 148 laps . NASCAR waited more than an hour-it was the day 's second rain delay-before declaring the event official and sending everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in Darlington last year-was the 500th Winston Cup victory for Ford Motor Co. dating to 1950 . It brought a $1 million bonus from series sponsor R.J. Reynolds as part of its No Bull 5 promotion . " I saw the rain coming , so I knew the guy leading when it got here probably was going to win the race , " Burton said . " But at that point , I was n't thinking all that much about the rain . I was thinking that if I could run fast and lead the race that 's what I should do since that 's what racing is all about . Yes , there was some urgency on my part to lead at halfway and stay ahead . But , really , it was a matter of me running as hard as I could on every lap . " Burton could only speculate about what might have happened if Martin had been serious about holding the lead . " Mark would have thrown everything he had at me , " he said , grinning . " He and Tony Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ran out of time . This is n't nearly as dramatic as it would have been if the weather had n't been a factor . It would have been a lot of fun to race them down to the end . Honestly , I do n't know what would have happened . " A week after winning the Las Vegas race , the Exide/POPULAR MECHANICS team finished a dead-last 43rd in the Cracker Barrel 500 at the Atlanta Motor Speedway . Burton was leading at lap 68 when his car 's left rear tire exploded at about 185 mph . His No. 99 Ford abruptly snapped around and slammed the Turn 3 wall-driver 's side first . Thankfully , he was n't injured , but his race car was destroyed . " No warning , no nothing , " he said after the violent crash . " I was just riding along , not pushing it all that hard . It was early , so I was n't taking any chances . I had just passed Mike Skinner and was settling in . When a tire goes like thatand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job for us-there 's nothing you can do about it . You 're just along for the ride . " A ride into the wall ! A week later at Darlington , Burton was better than he 'd been at Atlanta but not as good as he 'd been at Las Vegas . After finishing third in the Busch Series race on Saturday , he started 27th and finished fifth in the Mall.com 400 , a race won by his older brother , Ward . " We were loose , we were tight , we were all over the place , " Burton said . " We just never hit on the right chassis setup . We never got anywhere near close enough to run at the front . " Photograph Team owner Jack Roush has a hands-on approach to his team . Here he 's checking the No. 99 car 's spark plugs , looking for a clue to the engine 's performance . Sidebar Aero Matching NASCAR wants to be able to tell its huge public that , on any Sunday , any team can win the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the truth as possible , the sanctioning body tries very hard to keep the aerodynamics of the competing cars even by tweaking front and rear spoiler location , height , depth and width during each season . The organization periodically impounds one race car of each brand , and takes it into the Lockheed Marietta wind tunnel in Georgia for comparison testing . The aluminum templates that NASCAR uses at every race , and that every team has copies of , dictate the shape of the body . Every car has to pass under a total of 22 templates , and each template has a slightly different tolerance . It 's a very expensive , time-consuming exercise in advantage prevention , but some within and outside NASCAR 's Winston Cup series think there is a simple solution . Their idea is to make all of the major body templates exactly the same for all brands , with approved nose and tail sections for each brand . Each team would apply the team paint job and appropriate sponsor , grille , headlamp , taillamp and brand decals to the cars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford or Pontiac identity . It would become a cross between the International Race of Champions , where drivers race in identical cars , and Winston Cup as it is now . A close look at any current Winston Cup race car confirms that they are all " funny cars " anyway . They wear the names of front-engine , front-drive coupes and sedans but in reality they are coupes with V8s and rear drive , with ultralow ride heights , dramatically low hoodlines , tirehugging fender shapes , rounded front and rear corners , radically altered rear ends and painted-on headlights . Truth is , the Winston Cup cars already bear little resemblance to stock Grand Prix , Monte Carlo and Taurus street cars . So what would be wrong with making all the bodies the same and relying on the drivers , engine builders and chassis men to make the racing close and exciting ? Nothing , according to " Humpy " Wheeler , the showman who owns the speedways in Atlanta , Bristol , Charlotte , Dallas , Las Vegas and Sonoma . He says the cars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars would stop the constant rule changes and make the drivers and crew chiefs the central characters in each Sunday 's event . Wheeler says , " Right now we 're fighting constantly to keep cars competitive and it 's difficult to do with different body styles . fou can do all the wind-tunnel testing you want , but until you get on a track , and until you get the cars in a drafting situation , you really do n't know . " Wheeler continues , " I know the purists will scream , but we are in the entertainment business first and , without that , nothing else exists . We 'd rather have the fans discussing the drivers ' performances at the races-not the mechanical rules . We 're not that far from a common body today . " Doug Duchardt , NASCAR program manager at GM Racing , says , " It 's not an easy thing to bring two new cars into a new racing season , and NASCAR 's been willing to do three wind-tunnel tests to understand it . We did n't think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . Now the question is , what do they do for the Pontiac , which the tests show needs help . " " If you can use common templates and put fascias on the cars that give the cars an identity similar to the production cars , with some grille openings , headlights and taillights that give it some distinction , then we 're not opposed to common templates , " Duchardt says . Ford and most of its racers are strongly opposed to the common-template plan . Ford Racing boss Dan Davis has said that Ford is in racing in order to sell cars , and that common cars with decals are n't the same as the clearly superior Taurus body shell Ford races today and will race in the future . Jack Roush , who owns more Winston Cup teams than anyone else , including the Exide/PM team , says , " I have been a proponent of common templates for a long time . I 'm not talking about enough templates to egg-crate the car . I think we have twice as many templates as we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five could be common , with each template built to the shortest applicable dimension among the competing cars . Then you 'd need unique templates for each manufacturer in the areas of bumpers , headlights , taillights and those things that define the uniqueness of the car . We could have a common roof , a common hood , a common decklid , a common windshield , a common side panel , and a common rear spoiler dimension and shape , with different treatments for the front and rear fascias , and there 's still plenty of differentiation there for the manufacturers . " Roush says that NASCAR 's wind-tunnel tests , which measure drag and downforce with each car both straight and yawed , are not precisely matching aero from one car to another in that the tests do n't measure combinations of cars in drafting positions , do n't measure the effect of rear spoilers on cars behind and do n't use rolling roads to simulate what the tires do on a racetrack . " Am t a proponent of aero matching ? Yes , I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can achieve it precisely based on equipment limitations and procedures . " Kevin Triplett , NASCAR director of operations , had this to say : " We spent six to eight months on the common templates project starting in 1998 , then put it on the back burner . It came up again a couple of months ago . We 've been going to the wind tunnel periodically since the first Darlington race in 1995 , impounding cars after a race for the tests , because aero was becoming more important than horsepower . " We had to know where we stood , " Triplett adds and we used the wind tunnel as an educational tool . We 've gone back to the tunnel more and more frequently , but a large percentage of our decisions are still based on on-track performance , start to finish . We 're looking at the whole spectrum , from doing nothing more , to allowing minor modifications , to making all the cars very similar . We have n't ruled anything out , including the option of a single body shell . " - Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the PMZone Web site at **25;1136;TOOLONG // <p>
