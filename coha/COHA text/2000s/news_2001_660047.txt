<p> John Ashcroft , the man who would be attorney general , combines a deep respect for the law with a profound reverence for God . He begins each day with his " devotions . " He has had himself anointed with oil , as Old Testament figures did , before taking a new political office . He has set such a standard of personal integrity and religious faith that friends and colleagues insist that knowing him has improved their lives . Today , the United States Senate begins confirmation hearings that will decide how well personal piety and national politics mix . To some degree , Mr. Ashcroft 's nomination will test Americans ' willingness to accept ardently evangelical Christians in high national office . In the past , politicians whose religion was an issue - such as John Kennedy , a Roman Catholic , and Joseph Lieberman , a Jew - assured the public that their religious convictions would not overshadow their duty to uphold the laws of the land . That 's likely to be a key line of questioning for Ashcroft , who seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is debating whether national politics are too compromising of religious principles . Some influential evangelicals now suggest that the movement - and its adherents - should renounce politics altogether and go back to saving souls . Ashcroft 's record suggests that on most subjects he would offer a decidedly conservative but not extreme legal agenda . He opposes gun legislation and preferential hiring of minorities , but would continue the Clinton administration 's aggressive pursuit of antitrust cases . But on one subject he has proved unbending : He adamantly opposes abortion and even some forms of birth control . Such stands have led him to sometimes use extreme and partisan measures to block Clinton nominees - tactics that have provoked sharp dissent . " It is difficult for a person to have a strongly held set of religious beliefs and represent the country , " says Geoff Layman , a political scientist and author of " The Great Divide : Religious and Cultural Conflict in American Party Politics . " That 's because the nation 's great middle - mainstream Protestantism - is dwindling , while secularists at one pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise . " In the 1950s , we were still a Judeo-Christian nation , " he says . " There was a common set of moral values in the country ... Obviously , we do n't have that anymore . " One of Ashcroft 's cherished childhood memories is waking up to his father 's morning prayers . " Dad 's prayers were not the quiet , whispered entreaties of a timid Sunday school teacher , " he recalls in his 1998 book , " Lessons from a Father to his Son . " " My father prayed as if his family 's life and vitality were even then being debated on high as he bowed low . " J. Robert Ashcroft , an Assemblies of God minister , was a man ahead of his time . In the 1950s , when Pentacostals were marginalized by mainstream Protestants and looking inward , Robert Ashcroft saw the need to engage the world . He quoted Catholic priests and listened to black gospel music . Today , the Assemblies of God , the largest of the Pentecostal denominations , boasts 2.5 million adherents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward-looking spirit , leaving Springfield , Mo. , to earn degrees at Yale University and then the University of Chicago law school . By the time he returned to Springfield to practice law and teach business law , in 1967 , he was already turning heads . Friends and acquaintances remember a hard-working young man of energy and integrity . When Tom Fowler began teaching business law in 1972 , a longtime family friend insisted he meet Ashcroft . " He told me he was of such high quality that he was someone who I should get to know , " recalls Mr. Fowler , now a local bank president . <p> Bitten by the political bug That year also marked Ashcroft 's first foray into electoral politics . He ran for US Congress , lost in the primary , but got appointed to state auditor . He was eventually elected state attorney general in 1976 , then governor , and in 1994 , US senator . He compiled this electoral record by emphasizing the moderate parts of his agenda . As Missouri attorney general , for example , he joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he once used the same laws in an odd way to try to sue the National Organization for Women ) , says William Kovacic , a law professor at George Washington University who has studied Ashcroft 's record . Ashcroft could also compromise . As governor , despite a strong distaste for gambling , he implemented a state lottery when voters signaled they wanted one . But as the Republican Party shifted to the right after President Reagan 's election in 1980 , so did Ashcroft . While governor , he signed a bill declaring that life begins at conception and imposing numerous restrictions on abortions . The law was upheld by the US Supreme Court , leading to a wave of anti-abortion legislation around the country . In 1991 , Ashcroft lobbied unsuccessfully for further restrictions on abortion , including no exceptions for rape or incest . During his six years in the Senate , he repeatedly delayed or defeated Clinton nominees who did n't fit his moral code , including gay philanthropist Jim Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg and two surgeon-general nominees who backed abortion rights . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , denying him a federal judgeship last year , has raised the most eyebrows . The story surrounding that event is complex , but two facts stand out . First , Ashcroft distorted Judge White 's record , calling him soft on crime . Second , as a state representative in 1992 , White himself had used questionable tactics to defeat anti-abortion legislation that Ashcroft , then the governor , supported . Some civil rights activists say the move was racially motivated . ( Mr. White is black . ) Others suggest he needed a political issue for his tough Senate reelection . Still others call it political payback for killing the anti-abortion legislation . " I see his opposition to White as philosophical , but I think Ashcroft had a history of being a get-even politician , " says state Sen. Wayne Goode , a liberal Democrat . <p> A different view of Ashcroft None of these views squares with how friends and colleagues describe Ashcroft . Indeed , his record of appointing black judges suggests he is no more a racist than White is soft on crime ( although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns by calling Confederate leaders " Southern patriots " ) . And the charge of political payback does not jive with the gracious way Ashcroft conceded in November , after he barely lost a reelection campaign . More likely , two of Ashcroft 's most strongly held beliefs - his abhorrence for abortion and his distaste for judicial activism - made White unacceptable to him . In opposing abortion , Ashcroft closely reflects the position of the Assemblies of God , which in 1985 called it " evil man 's defiance of the Almighty . " And he has consistently denounced the kind of judicial activism that he says legalized abortion in the first place . If Ashcroft does become attorney general , he will inherit cases such as the antitrust suit against Microsoft - and very likely oversee many others with a sense of integrity that has marked his career . " My guess is that law enforcement will for the most part continue in the same manner , " says Michael Seigel , a law professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville . But in setting America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own strong , anti-abortion stamp on the judiciary . Tricia Cowen contributed to this story . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
