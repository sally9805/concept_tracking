Boston has n't changed much since Sam " Mayday " Malone made last call on Cheers , the TV show that defined Beantown for a generation . Thanks to the Yankees ' Aaron Boone  --  with an assist from former Boston manager Grady Little  --  Red Sox fans are still waiting to get into another World Series . Everyone else is still waiting in traffic , which moves like clam chowder through a straw thanks to the " Big Dig , " the epic road construction project that began back when Norm and Cliff were propping up the Cheers bar . One thing that has changed for the better is the golf . The PGA Tour buzzed through town last year with the Deutsche Bank Championship at the TPC of Boston , the first big-time event here since the 1999 Ryder Cup at The Country Club in Brookline . Those courses are private , but the area has enjoyed a boom in public-access tracks not seen since Donald Ross worked here in the 1930s . Many of those Ross designs are still in play . The Franklin Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a short drive takes you to Merrimack , Sandy Burr , Leo J. Martin , Newton Commonwealth and Ponkapoag . Some locals insist these remain classic tests despite the frayed edges , while others dismiss them as short and run-down , throwaways cranked out without much thought or artistry . In 2002 , a USGA delegation toured Ponkapoag , curious if a Bethpage Black-style facelift might make it a future U.S. Open venue . It was decided not . If it 's not good enough for the USGA , it 's not good enough for me , so I passed on a Ross redux tour and checked out the newer offerings along a 30-mile stretch of the corridor between Boston and Providence , Rhode Island . Ten miles south of Boston in Quincy is Granite Links Golf Club at Quarry Hill , the first new course built inside the Interstate 95 circle in 30 years . ( So new , it may not have all 18 holes open to the public until this July Fourth weekend . ) It is certainly the best by-product of the Big Dig : More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cap three landfills , creating a 450-acre canvas for architect John Sanford . Granite Links offers amazing views of the Blue Hills Reservation to the west and Boston Harbor and the down-town skyline to the north and east . Many holes are cut into the side of mounds like terraced gardens and defined by foot-high fescue , water-filled quarries and huge greens . In fact , the elevation changes so much that carts ought to come with a flight attendant . The 14th hole is a short par 4 of 369 yards , but if you do n't find the left side of the fairway from the tee , the approach will be blind . If you err to the right  --  as I did  --  aim a middle iron just left of the Hancock Building and you 'll be fine . Granite Links is the new kid on the block , but a few miles south sits a golden oldie , Braintree Municipal Golf Course . Most of the hazards on this 6,564-yard track are real  --  water is in play on 14 holes  --  but some are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pond behind the 8th green . Locals often drop a ball and chip it at the reptile ; closest to the gator wins a soda at the turn ( there 's no beer available here ) . Geese are about as popular in these parts as Yankees fans : The course mascot , a border collie named Sage , is trained to hound the birds . Sage is often tied up near the clubhouse and welcomes a scratch behind the ear . The 7th is a 398-yard dogleg-left that the Boston Globe declared one of the Best 18 Public holes in Massachusetts . Water lines both sides , and a creek slices across the fairway about 50 yards short of the green . Beware : There 's more room right off the tee than there appears . From Braintree , take a short hop east to Scituate , a harbor town that mixes commercial fishing grit and touristy charm . Almost any place in town , particularly around Mill Wharf , you 'll find some of the freshest seafood anywhere on dry land . Wash it down with a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " Sawx " game . Just outside town is Widow 's Walk Golf Course , a 6,403-yard Michael Hurdzan design that weaves around environmentally sensitive areas . The course won praise when it opened in 1997 , but many folks thought it was so narrow as to be almost unplayable . Subsequent alterations have made the layout more forgiving , but it continues to struggle against that initial word of mouth . The faint of heart wo n't find much comfort here . At the 434-yard 13th , your drive must stay short of a pond and the approach is over the water to a green flanked on the left by more water . About 20 miles to the southwest in West Bridgewater is Riverbend Country Club , home to a 6,659-yard layout with a split personality . The front side is wide open , while the back winds through dense trees . The most stress-inducing hole is the 16th , a 572-yarder that double-doglegs tightly around the trees , leaving most players a third shot of about 150 yards . After your round , hit the Chilli Head Barbeque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire up your game . Across town , Olde Scotland Links Golf Course is neither old nor Scottish nor a links . Still , if you think open terrain and gentle mounds make a links , then this is your kind of place , though the back nine has a natural , parkland feel . Other nontraditional features add to the disconnect : The clubhouse is a trailer dropped in a dusty parking lot , and the property is spliced by roads , a row of houses and power lines . I suspect " Olde " Tom Morris never knew a links like this . The only familiar links element here is the wind , but since the 6,790-yard course is so open , you can rip it off the tee safe in the knowledge that you 'll have a shot , even if from another fairway . The only thought-provoking hole is the 476-yard , par-5 9th , where those who attack the green in two face a long carry over water . On your way out of town , stop at Emma 's Pub and Pizza , where signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the " soon-to-be-famous " double-breasted chicken parm . Just off I-95 in Canton is Brookmeadow Country Club , a fairly straightforward 6,637-yard track with a mixed bag of tough doglegs , elevated greens and a dash of devilish psychology . Take the 191-yard 4th , which plays almost imperceptibly uphill to a large green tilted toward the tee . This optical illusion makes the putting surface appear much closer than it is . All four people in my group came up short , so fight your eye and take an extra club . Stop at the bar after the round and have your love of the game burnished by Dan Daley , who has worked here for 27 years and has a lifetime of stories and golf tips to offer . From Canton , it 's a quick spin down I-95 to Foxborough Country Club , a semiprivate course that is open to the public all day Tuesdays and Wednesdays and after 3 p.m. on weekends . This 6,849-yard Geoffrey Cornish design is studded with old pines , maples and oaks , giving the place a classic , regal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between trees left and water right . Here 's some local knowledge : The huge bunker that appears to be right next to the green is actually about 70 yards short of it . New England Country Club in Bellingham is just off Route 495 . About a mile past the course , you 'll find Kay 's , a homey cafe where the menu is printed on the napkin and consists of nine sandwiches , a lobster roll and nachos . It might sound scant , but it 's actually a case of knowing what you do well and sticking with it . The Hale Irwin-designed course is pretty tasty as well , giving golfers the priceless feeling of isolation on almost every hole . At just 6,483 yards , it sounds short , but the terrain is so hilly that it plays more like 7,000 yards . The site is dotted with huge boulders that protrude from the turf like sculptures . There are also some picturesque walls of hand-laid stone that make you wonder if the course borders Robert Frost 's farm . The downside of the terrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yardage book in the pro shop before you tee off . One challenging hole is the 401-yard 9th . From the elevated tee , you need to rifle a shot at least 210 yards through a chute of trees and over a deep ravine . From there , you have a downhill approach to a green tucked into the trees behind a creek . The 428-yard 18th is also a tester : From the upper level of its two-tiered green , your downhill slider could roll off the front and into the water . If you survive with a two-putt , you 'll be ready to call it a trip and head home . But no visit to Boston is complete without a game at Fenway Park . The hated Yankees arrive for a three-game set July 23 , which would be a nice capper to any trip . Afterward , sample the great lobster and chowder at the Black Horse Tavern at Faneuil Hall Marketplace , followed by a cold beer at the Littlest Bar on Province Street . You 'll be amazed by how many people can cram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having . Even if you skip the boys of summer , you ca n't help but hit a home run with the public-access golf in Greater Boston .
