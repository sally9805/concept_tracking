Last summer Brandon Hancock , a highly touted 6 ' 2 " fullback from Clovis West High , in Fresno , made two tough decisions . First he chose to attend Southern Cal over Stanford , Texas , Michigan and Notre Dame . Then he decided to forgo the final semester of his senior year to enroll at USC early , begin work toward a degree and participate in spring drills . Matriculating early is a path that is gaining popularity around the country  --  last January at least 15 other football players did so  --  though college coaches emphasize that only the most well-rounded student-athletes should attempt it . // Hancock , a physically precocious 18-year-old , has the alltime highest high school cumulative score on the strength , speed and agility tests at Nike 's training camps . He 's also an honors student who graduated with a 4.0 GPA , and he had to get approval from his school board before he was allowed to cram into one semester the three independent study courses and seven regular classes he needed to graduate in December 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing all that defines life for a collegian . What follows is the diary Hancock kept for SI detailing the ups and downs of his early leap to higher education  --  in the classroom and on the field . // JANUARY 17 , 2002 // I 'll start by explaining why I gave up my final months of high school . I really did n't see it as that big a sacrifice . I 'm a one-sport athlete , so once football season was over , I did n't want to fight senioritis and kill time until graduation . I wanted to remain productive and excel . Also , I like being an underclassman . It may sound strange , but I enjoy having people to look up to and keep me humble . In high school I had reached all the goals I had set for myself . I knew USC would offer new challenges . By doing this I 'll get ahead with my course work and get to participate in spring practice , hopefully increasing my chance of seeing playing time in the fall . Although I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of good friends . But Coach Pete Carroll and the staff at USC are more than happy to let me go home for the prom or any other high school function I want to attend . Overall , I mink I have much more to gain than to lose . // I drove down here about a week ago in the 1990 BMW my parents are letting me use , and I was immediately swept up by fraternity rush . I went to a party every night for four nights . Some houses had 400 people and two deejays , and it seemed as if every house made sure the girl-to-guy ratio was 3 to 1 . A friend of mine from Fresno is a Pi Kappa , and that frat rushed me and eventually offered me a bid . I said thanks , but not now . My priorities coming here are to establish myself athletically and academically . I 'll have time for that other stuff later . // Tom Malone a punter who enrolled early and I came here midway through the academic year , so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the football players . We 're living at a new dorm that just opened up . My roommate is an English major , and I do n't see much of him . // I had heard the horror stories about dorm food , but so far I 've been pleasantly surprised . The cafeteria near my dorm has good variety and a great salad bar . // I 'm taking three classes , each for four units : Writing 140 , Philosophy 140 and Intro to Technical Programming . Fortunately , none of them starts before 11 a.m. // JANUARY 26 // Things here are spectacular . I just got back from the USC-Stanford basketball game at the Sports Arena . Guard Chris Hernandez was a good friend of mine in high school , and he 's now playing for Stanford as a true freshman . I sat in an empty courtside seat right behind Chris 's bench , so I was able to razz him when he came out . Keyshawn Johnson was right next to me . I introduced myself , and he gave me the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a great tradition we have at USC. // I have been working out with the team for almost three weeks . I have not had to make any effort to fit in with the older guys . They were aware I was coming and have been very welcoming . When I came in , I weighed 227 , and within one week I was up to 235 at 5.1% body fat . Normally I follow a pretty regimented diet that does n't include much junk food , but strength coach Chris Carlisle suggested it might be in my best interests to increase my body fat , so I am trying to eat a pizza a week . // Working out alongside Freshman All-America defensive end Shaun Cody and players like senior All-America safety Troy Polamalu and senior tailback Sultan McCullough is an inspiration . It forces me to push myself to the limit . Thus far I have not experienced the slightest bit of hazing or so-called freshman fear . I have already established myself as a formidable athlete within the group . I am , in fact , outlifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench at 225 pounds , I did 29 reps , the fourth-highest total ( first for running backs ) on the team , and I 'm holding my own in agility drills . Most of the guys call me Super Swole because my arms are so big , they look swollen . The coaches are impressed and claim that I am the real deal behind all the hype . Another fullback , Chad Pierson , invited me to train with him , so that 's another positive . // I started attending study hall and found that it helps tremendously . My classes are a lot tougher than those I took in high school , especially writing . The writing topics require much more in-depth thinking , and the papers have to be a lot longer . There have been a bunch of girls who have started coming out of the woodwork , too . Initially they did n't pay much attention to me , but as soon as I started strutting around with my football gear on , they started coming around by the dozens ! ( Just kidding. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were no coaches present , but we got a great deal of work done . Quarterback Carson Palmer pretty much ran everything . We ran routes and went over a couple of plays , and I got a chance to compare myself with the other fullbacks . In addition to Hancock and Pierson , USC has three other fullbacks trying to replace three-year starter Charlie Landrigan , a free-agent signee with the Washington Redskins . I feel pretty confident as far as my speed and hands are concerned , but we 'll know more when we get the pads on in March . // Classes are becoming much harder than I had expected , and I 'm having to spend a lot more time studying to get good grades . On the bright side , I 'm starting to get noticed more around campus . The L.A. Daily News had a little story on me and Tom Malone , and a reporter with the school magazine interviewed me today . People I do n't even know have started coming up to me and saying , " Hey , Brandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a very sociable guy , and he flipped out after my cousin slept on the floor one night . So I have the place all to myself . I shoved the two beds together to make a king-size . Not a bad setup for a freshman ! // FEBRUARY 24 // Last week I had two seven-page papers due . The one for my writing class was one of the best I 've ever written , yet I only got a B- . The teacher and I had a conference at Starbucks . She told me that had I still been in high school , the paper would have been a high A , but that I now need to take it to the college level . Still , my paper was one of the better ones in the class . // The other day the older players made me enter an auction , which was quite funny . Some of the big-time athletes were to be sold to girls for dates in a fund-raiser . I got on stage in front of about 300 people and took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty nice round of applause . I was the only freshman in the auction and the only white guy . I had a blast . Someone bid $20 on me , but she has n't called me for a date . // I had my first midterm last Wednesday , in my computer class . I got the highest grade in the class , a 96 . My parents were stoked . I am also one of the points leaders in study hall ; we get points for attendance and work ethic . // The dorm food I was praising earlier grew old fast , so I have started eating out a lot . Workouts are going well . I am up to 242 pounds and am continuing to chase down the weightroom records . I got on the Board a list of the top 10 lifts in USC history by squatting 550 pounds , the third best in school history for my weight class , which was 215-236 at the time . I caught a couple of passes in 7-on-7 practice last week . The coaches are impressed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be getting playing time in the fall . I 'll know for sure once we put on the pads . // I went home last weekend for the Presidents ' Day holiday . I went to a basketball game against our biggest rival , Clovis High . I felt like a star . As I stood up in front of the Clovis West rooter section , everyone went nuts . I was wearing my USC warm-ups and felt like a big college student . I went to a couple of parties at home , and everyone treated me wonderfully and was very inquisitive . // MARCH 21 // I went to Cabo San Lucas for five days during spring break with my dad and cousin Matt Smith . You would n't believe the caliber of college hotties down there . I had fun hanging on the beach all day and dancing at night . // When we left , I went straight to Fresno . I got to hang out at my high school , and I worked out in the weight room during sixth and seventh periods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a massive pump going . People could n't believe how much bigger I had gotten . The girls loved it . One day I went on campus during lunch and hung out with my friends , just catching up . I found that I had way more stories to tell than they did , and they all seemed sort of jealous . Everyone seemed antsy to graduate . // My favorite teacher , Mr. Jolliff , asked if I would talk to his literature students about what to expect in college . My old classmates had a lot of questions and were very interested in what I had to say , although I could tell some of the girls thought I was the most arrogant guy in the world . When I talked about seeing Cameron Diaz eating sushi in Brentwood , a few of them just rolled their eyes . // One night I took out Kelli Bennett . She 's a junior , a petite cheerleader I 'd started talking to a lot right before I left for USC . I was basically trying to set things up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have her waiting and willing to go . I left two days later and headed back to LA to watch the Clovis West pep and cheer squads compete in Anaheim in the USA Spirit Nationals . Through my stepbrother , Mike Fries , who works at Disneyland , I got a nice suite at the Disneyland Hotel , and all my buds from Fresno stayed with me after watching their girlfriends do their thing in the competition . It was pretty cool to be a high school kid for those few days , but I would n't trade it for what I 've got going now . // MARCH 26 // Today was the first day of spring practice in pads . What a shell-shocker ! In one drill I was going full speed when Polamalu laid into me . I saw him coming , but I still got rolled . I had never been hit like that , but this is the way it 's going to be in college . Everyone is big , everyone is strong . Also , as a freshman you have a target on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've started to relieve stress by heading out to Venice or Manhattan Beach to study or just hangout. // MARCH 28 After getting obliterated by Polamalu yesterday , I was determined not to let that happen again . But during one play with the first team today , I was more concerned about where Polamalu was than I was with my blocking assignment . At the snap I hit the first defender I saw when I hit the hole . I blasted him with a solid , crushing block , and I got up excited about finally getting the better end of a hit . As I turned around though , I saw a massive figure stomping in my direction  --  my 275-pound Samoan position coach , Kennedy Pola . I could feel his eyes burning through me as he yelled and sprayed saliva in my face . He told me that I had completely blown my assignment and that my screwup had resulted in senior tailback Justin Fargas getting the piss knocked out of him . I was scared . Coach Pola intimidated me so much that I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 // Today we had a scrimmage in the Coliseum . I did n't have any carries , but I did make one catch for 13 yards . It has been hard to get reps with the first team , and that has been frustrating . The coaches will give you a shot with the big boys , but as soon as you mess up , you get pulled out . I 'm still making a lot of mental mistakes . I may be one of the five strongest guys on the team , and I may be faster and have better hands than some of the vets , but I am useless until I know what my role is on every play . // The mental aspect of the game has been the toughest transition for me . In high school your assignment is set in stone , and the defense reacts to you . In college the offense and defense read and react to each other . You have to notice if the linebackers are going to bow over to the side , or if the free safety is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to know how to read shades and gaps , and everything is always changing . // Aaron Graham , a senior linebacker , has started calling me Hancock 2002 , as though I 'm some destructive machine . He 'll say in this robotic voice , " He is on a mission to destroy all linebackers. " // APRIL 20 Today was the spring game , the last day of NCAA-sanctioned practice until mid-August . I sprained a ligament in my neck in a head-to-head collision with a linebacker the other day , so I did n't play . But I know where I stand . I 'm third on the depth chart , and I have a lot of work ahead of me this summer . I 'm going to stay down here , go to summer school and work out . I 'll watch a lot of film and work on my blocking technique . I never had to block in high school , but here there are much faster guys who need to carry the ball . I 'll probably be a situational player at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , finals are coming up , and so is the prom . Kelli Bennett is in town shopping with her mom tonight ; I 'm going to take her out and pop the question about the prom . // MAY 8 // My first college finals are over , and they were n't too bad . After the last day of class , on April 26,1 had an entire week to study . My philosophy tutor helped me break down and understand complex arguments on such issues as abortion , animal rights , war and terrorism . I have n't gotten my grade back on the exam yet , but I think I did well an A- . I aced my ITP/computer test , a 93 , and finished the class with a solid A. Instead of a test in my writing class , we had a short in-class essay , primarily to show that our writing skills matched those of our previous four papers and that we had n't been plagiarizing . I got an A-in that class , which is quite an accomplishment according to my classmates. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be , but I thought the semester as a whole was more stressful than finals week . // MAY 13 // Last Saturday night I went to the Clovis West High prom , and I found myself feeling very nostalgic . Even though I had left high school only a few months ago , it seemed like ages since I had seen a lot of the faces . I really noticed how much my friends had matured , not just physically , but mentally and socially as well . // Prom evening was not without stress . I was already running late when I discovered that my rental tuxedo pants were the wrong size and would not accommodate my huge butt and thighs . The jacket looked good , but the pants looked like a pair of tights on me . ( When I told the guy at the rental place my measurements , 33-inch waist and 43-inch hips , he said , " We 're not that versatile . " ) So I wore my black suit pants . I was 20 minutes late picking up Kelli and 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // I must say , Kelli looked amazing , as did many of the other ladies there . We had 44 people in our group , and we took a charter bus to the dinner and dance . We arrived at the prom pretty late , about 10:30 , so we did n't have much time to bust some moves . The music was slow at first , but picked up soon enough . You would 've thought I was Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing . We boogied until the music died . After the bus dropped us off at our cars , we all went home and freshened up and then met at a friend 's house for the real party . There were about 60 of us , all my favorite people , and we partied until about 7 a.m . It was a night that I 'll never forget , the last hurrah for every one of my friends . We 'll never be young and all together again . It meant so much for me to participate in the festivity , and I must thank Coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for allowing me to do it . I will cherish the memory forever . // Epilogue : On Wednesday , Brandon was scheduled to don a cap and gown and graduate with the rest of the Clovis West class of ' 02 . He then planned to return to Southern Cal , where he will attend summer school and haunt the weight room . Unlike incoming freshman football players who begin classes on Aug. 26 , he 'll be allowed by the NCAA to work with USC strength coaches over the summer , giving himself even more of a jump start . " Entering college early is n't for everyone , " he says . " But for players who can handle the academics , it 's a great move . I 've become comfortable with college life , and in terms of my progress on the football field , I 'm ridiculously far ahead of where I would have been if I had come in the fall . Compared to high school , the college semester flew by . I still have as many as 10 semesters ahead of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
