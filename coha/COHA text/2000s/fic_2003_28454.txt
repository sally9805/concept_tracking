Chapter One " An older woman . That 's what I 'm thinking . Widowed , divorced , I 'm not in a position to be picky . Or it could be somebody younger with a mother . Everybody has a mother . One of them must be widowed or divorced , you would think . " Nathaniel Edward Parker paused in his speech , leaning back in his chair behind the large wooden desk in his office . Across from him was his longtime best friend and business partner , Jared Hunter . They were supposed to be having a business meeting . Jared looked up from the papers in front of him wearing a very puzzled look on his face . " What ? Nate , could you please stay focused here ? We need to convince Harry Zigler to sign this contract so we can pay our rent next month . " " Sorry . I 'm a little distracted . " " No kidding . Look , buddy , I need you to pay attention . This is important . " " And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jared . " Jared looked disgruntled . " Yeah ? Well , you 've got another one right here . This contract ... " Nate ruthlessly interrupted Jared . " I can not pay attention to the contract . God knows I 've tried , but it 's impossible . Maybe if we clear up this other issue I 'll be able to concentrate . " Jared blew out a sigh . " What other issue ? We have to make up a list of people we know who have mothers before you can focus ? What is that all about ? " " Available mothers . Big difference . " Nate drummed his desktop with his fingers . " For my dad . Ever since Mom died , he 's been making me crazy . " Jared snorted . " So what else is new ? Your mom 's been dead for two years . You should be used to it by now . " Nate raked a hand through his blond hair . " No . Lately it 's been getting worse . I ca n't concentrate because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other bizarre way we can improve the business . " " Giving away Fourth of July fireworks with the company logo on the package was n't that bizarre . " " Please . Nobody who saw them blow would realize that blue and green are the company colors and the first person who loses a hand would sue our butts off . You can bet dear old Dad would n't offer to pay the lawyer 's bill , either . He ca n't . He does n't have that kind of money . " Jared rattled the papers on the table . " About this contract , " he began determinedly . Nate flattened his palm over the rustling papers . " Not until I have my list . " Throwing up his hands , Jared relented . " All right , all right . I 'm almost afraid to ask . What do you plan to do with this list of people with mothers . Available mothers , " Jared immediately corrected before Nate could . " Marry the old guy off ? " " Well , yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jared pointed an accusing finger at his buddy . " You are serious . " He threw himself back in his chair . " Aw , man , I do n't believe this . What are we , a dating service now ? We 've got a business here , Nate . We do n't have time to run a lonely hearts club , too . " " Well , we ca n't take care of business with my father breathing down our necks , now can we ? The man is lost without Mom , lost . The way I see it , the only solution we 've got is to find him some other interest in life besides me , his only son . " Nate sat up , his irritation with his partner 's obtuseness obvious . " A wife , for example ? " Jared asked . " Exactly . Look . It 's obvious . " Nate picked up a marker and leaned to the side , writing on a large sheet of paper clipped to a tripod . " Look , we 'll flowchart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word father in large block type at the top of the paper and pointed to it . " My father . " Jared rolled his eyes and nodded . " Your father . " " Has been sticking his nose in where it does n't belong , making us crazy on a daily basis since my mom passed away . " Nate drew a dash down from the word father and wrote Nate and Jared . " I still do n't think the fireworks were that bad an idea . " " Shut up . Dad needs something to distract him from us , right ? " Jared nodded . " Okay . Distractions can be good . That would probably work . " " He needs a woman in his life . He never bugged me like this when Mom was around . She kept him occupied . " " I do n't mean to speak disrespectfully of the dead , but your mom was nuts , " Jared pointed out , stating what he thought to be the obvious . " Keeping her out of trouble was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the truth . " Mom distracted him , see ? " " Uh-huh . So we make this list of available women and this helps us ... how ? Exactly how do we get them together ? " Jared waggled a finger admonishingly . " And no force allowed . Shotgun weddings went out a long time ago . " Nate waggled the marker right back at his partner . " We 'll worry about that part when we get that far . Think about it . This makes perfect sense . Somebody we know is bound to have an unattached female relative of the right age somewhere in their family tree . We just have to find her . Once we accomplish that , we sic her on Pop . Women are supposed to be naturally nurturing , right ? She 'll be all over him , cooking him wholesome dinners and stuff like that . He wo n't be able to resist . She distracts him , see ? Then he leaves us alone . Easy . " Openly snickering at his buddy 's logic , Jared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know about that . I 've been out with one or two that would probably eat their own young . " But he gave it some thought . " You , um , really think this will work ? " Nate reached for the coffeepot that sat on a warmer on one side of the table . " Damn straight . " Jared held out his coffee cup . " Okay , if you say so . Now , who goes on the list ? And do n't say my mother . I do n't want her tangled in your nutty schemes . Then she 'd start driving me crazy . " Nate took a cautious sip of hot coffee . " No , your mother 's out . I 'll admit I thought about her , but I do n't think she 'd put up with my father 's antics . Does n't she have any unmarried sisters or anything ? " " No . " " Not even one ? " " No . God broke the mold after creating my mother . " Jared folded his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God . " Nate slumped in his chair . " Okay , all right . Who do we know who does ? " The two men sat , marking the highly polished conference tabletop with fingerprints as they drummed their fingers and thought . Tentatively Jared offered out loud , " Anne Reid brought in brownies the other day . She must have a mother . " Nate snorted . " They were awful . Her mother probably taught her everything she does n't know about baking and Dad 's an old-fashioned kind of guy . He 'd never go for a woman who could n't bake . " " All right , I tried . This is your problem , you think of somebody . " " Our problem , " Nate corrected . " Remember the contract ? I ca n't concentrate until we take care of this . " Nate gave Jared a mean little smile . " And just so you know , Dad 's signed up for a computer class over at the high school 's adult education program . He 's decided to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat up straight , suddenly far more serious . " Fine . Mitzi Malone . " " She was hatched , not born . Try again .
