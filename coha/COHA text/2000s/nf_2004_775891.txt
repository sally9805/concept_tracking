The Mess in Texas // As you fly over the Houston Ship Channel at twilight , thousands of flares seem to ignite in the approaching darkness . Smokestacks from more than a hundred massive chemical factories , oil refineries , and power plants have suddenly become steel towers of light and fire . From the air , it 's not hard to understand why some call this area the " golden triangle . " This concentration of industry , which includes a 3,000-acre ExxonMobil facility the planet 's largest oil refinery  --  generates enough wealth for its owners to make the Texas economy bigger than the gross domestic product of most nations . 1 // It is a different scene on the ground . There the twilight flares rumble , the ground shakes , the air hisses . Plumes of black smoke belch upward and acrid odors permeate the atmosphere . The smell of money , some call it . But from this earthly vantage point  --  especially for low-income residents living downwind in eastern Harris County  --  it is less a golden triangle than a scene out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning " Do n't Mess With Texas , " have n't deterred the state 's polluters one bit . Here are some basic facts about the Lone Star State : According to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , fully one-quarter of Texas 's streams and rivers are so polluted that they do not meet standards set for recreational use . 2 Half of the state 's 20 million people reside in areas where the smog pollution surpasses federal limits . 3 In 1999 , Houston overtook Los Angeles as America 's smoggiest city . Texas also ranked first in toxic releases to the environment , first in total toxic air emissions from industrial facilities , first in toxic chemical accidents , and first in cancer-causing pollution . 4 Also in 1999 , 15 of the nation 's 30 highest smog readings were all taken in Texas . 5 Every major urban area  --  Houston , Dallas , San Antonio , Austin , El Paso , and Longview  --  either failed to meet the EPA 's minimum air quality standards , or was on the verge of failing . 6 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Tom Smith , director of the Texas office of Public Citizen , a consumer advocacy organization . He cites a recent mayoral study estimating annual pollution-related health care costs of between $2.9 and $3.1 billion in the Houston metropolitan area alone . 7 Air pollution kills an estimated 435 people a year in the city . 8 " We lead the nation in childhood asthma , " says Lanell Anderson , a resident of Clear Lake , a town south of Houston that 's surrounded by chemical plants . " We lead the nation in childhood cancer ... Our cup runneth over . " 9 // Texas has long been one of the most polluted states in the country , but rather than remedy the situation , George W. Bush set out to destroy virtually all attempts to clean up the state 's tainted air , water , and land . During his six-year reign as governor , from 1994 to 2000 , Texas dropped to number 49 in spending on the environment . 10 Under his watch , Texas had the worst pollution record in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air . It had the highest emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) , accounting for a least 10 percent of the national total . It had the most chemical spills and Clean Water Act violations , and produced the largest volume of hazardous waste . 11 As New York Times colum nist Bob Herbert put it shortly before Bush received the Republican nomination in 2000 , " Mr. Bush 's relationship to the environment is roughly that of a doctor to a patient  --  where the doctor 's name is Kevorkian. " 12 // The anti-environment agenda of today 's White House was honed and perfected during Bush 's gubernatorial years . It was in Texas that he developed the tactics and policies that guide his autocratic leadership today : closed-door meetings with industry insiders who are among his biggest campaign contributors ; reliance on pseudo-scientific " studies " by right wing think tanks ; emasculation of regulations that cut into industry profits ; citizens muzzled in debates that affect their communities . // Soon after becoming governor , Bush declared tort reform an " emergency issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Texans to bring class action lawsuits against polluters . In 1995 he pushed through the Private Real Property Rights Preservation Act , a radical " takings " bill that would make taxpayers pay polluters ' cost of complying with pollution laws . According to this view , corporations should be able to do what they want with their private property ; if the state cuts into their profits by forcing them to adopt pollution-control measures , the state ( i.e. , the public ) should pay . This perverse doctrine reverses a millennium of western property law that holds that owners can use their property as the please , but never in a way that diminishes their neighbors ' property or the public trust properties like air and water . Leading the charge for this radical new approach was right-wing private-property advocate Marshall Kuykendall , who complained at a public forum that the last time the federal government took our property without compensation is " when Lincoln freed the slaves . " 13 // In another foreshadowing of his presidency , Bush installed a pro-industry troika to run the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bush selected Barry McBee , a lawyer with a host of oil-industry clients , to chair the TNRCC . At his previous position at the Texas Department of Agriculture , farm labor and environmental groups accused McBee of helping to dismantle a program that kept farmworkers out of fields that were still " hot " after pesticide applications . The second appointee was Ralph Marquez , a former Monsanto executive and lobbyist for the Texas Chemical Council . Marquez quashed a plan to issue health warnings to Houston residents on high-smog days and later testified before a congressional committee that ozone " is a relatively benign pollutant. " 14 Bush 's third appointment was a cattleman named John Baker , former official of the Texas Farm Bureau , a sworn enemy of pesticide regulations . 15 // The new TNRCC came to be known by the moniker " Train Wreck . " Until this new regime was in place , all Texas citizens had the right to challenge pollution permits required by companies for their waste disposal . This right is one of the few recourses that regular folks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ravages of pollution . The new TNRCC soon eliminated this policy , as well as the longstanding practice of making surprise inspections of industrial plants . It discovered loopholes in all kinds of federal and state environmental regulations ... //
