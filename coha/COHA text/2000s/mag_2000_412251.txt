MAN , IT WAS HOT . Tyrell Wexley blinked sweat out of his eyes and squinted at his older brother , Lowell , who was making his way up a narrow ridge that had been cut into the side of this scrubby hillock . The gully below them shimmered in the summer heat " See anything , Ty ? " Lowell called . Tyrell hated to say it , but he had n't spotted a thing . For the past three days he , his brother and Lowell 's two friends had been scouring the area for eggs , tooth marks and any other traces left in sandstone by dinosaurs that had lived hereabout millions of years ago . The paleontology students at the University of Montana had received permission to search for fossils along the outskirts of a ranch about 50 miles from Chateau . After three days of hard searching , though , they had found nothing except scrub , dust , horrific afternoon thunderstorms and snakes . And heat . IF IT GOT ANY HOTTER , Tyrell thought , they 'd be able to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those 60-plus million-year-old hadrosaur eggs Lowell , Ken Orel and Manuel Sanchez hoped to find . Tyrell did n't know why the guys were so puzzled about the dinosaurs ' disappearance 60 million years ago . With this heat , he figured they had died of sunstroke . JUST A WEEK BEFORE he 'd been really psyched at being invited to join Lowell and his buddies for a field trip in the high plains of Montana . Now , Tyrell wished he had n't come . It was n't just the heat , either ; he had this feeling that he was always in the way . Although everybody was kind to him , and though he did his best to help out in any way he could , he knew he was no asset to the group . For one thing , he did n't know the first thing about paleontology . All his knowledge about dinosaurs came from videos or the movies and from what he 'd picked up from talk around the evening campfires . HE HAD LEARNED , for instance , that hadrosaurs had lived during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like duck bills . That was weird enough , but what really impressed Tyrell was that each big reptile had sported about 2,000 teeth ! // <p>
