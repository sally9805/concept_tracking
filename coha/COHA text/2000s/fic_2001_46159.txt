Rick Heller and his wife Cindy live outside of Boston . Since he made his debut here last March with " Loyal Puppies , " he has left his job designing computer systems for cooks in the Marine Corps and is nowin the employ of a company that makes online shopping easier . He is currently at work on a suspense novel entitled Smart Genes . Mr. Heller says this story , written in homage to Jules Verne 's Michael Strogoff , grew out of a trip to Paris he and his wife made recently . He has not yet ascertained whether Mustafa Azimov , the man honored by the Azimov Mosque in Kazan , was any relation to the Good Doctor . <p> I WAS ON DUTY AT THE Foreign Ministry , in my old office at the Quai d'Orsay , when an urgent call came in from Tatarstan . An officer of the Armee de l'Air appeared on the screen , a gash visible above his eyebrow . " There 's been an attack on the delegation , " he said . " Fleury has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? It seemed unbelievable . When we were young diplomats , Jean-Do led me one night on a drunken excursion through the clubs of Brazzaville in the Congo Republic . We met two beautiful Peace Corps workers from the United States , and after a wild ride back to the hotel , made love to them in the same room . Death and Jean-Do did not belong together . But the report was reliable , and the news would be broadcast soon by Agence France-Presse . Margherita , Jean-Do 's widow , would have to be told immediately . I selected Margherita 's entry from my phone contact list . She answered the call right away . She was outdoors , in the Place des Vosges by the look of it . " Margherita , it 's Roland . Something 's happened . " " Something bad ? " The image went jerky due to her attempts to juggle the phone . " The worst . " I paused a moment to compose myself , so my voice would n't crack .

" My next call was to the Minister , who would no doubt contact the President . I kept the staff until 21:00 that evening , getting the latest from Tatarstan and arranging for the return of Jean-Do 's remains . Later , as I cleared my desk , I received a call from the Elysee Palace . My presence was requested at a breakfast meeting the next morning . When I arrived at the Elysee , Jacques Roux-Levy , the President 's Special Counselor , was the only one there . He was sporting a ridiculous goatee that made him look like a twentieth-century revolutionary agitator . " How avant-garde , Jacques ! A nice touch , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been invited , " Roux-Levy said . I was struck dumb . I 'd seen the President many times before as JeanDo 's deputy ; now I would meet with him on my own . Not that I 'd been terribly impressed by the man up until now . How had Chavanne amassed a fortune of twenty million euros when he 'd been on the government payroll for the last fifteen years ? By steering a few deals to this contractor or that , perhaps ? Roux-Levy led me into the President 's office , where we settled down around a small table piled high with brioche . " Good morning , Monsieur Jolivet . " The President shook my hand . " This affair in the Volga - it 's getting worse and worse . Now it has taken our Jean-Dominique . " The President looked at me intently . At that moment , he no longer seemed to me like Marcel Chavanne , former mayor of Bordeaux . He was heir to De Gaulle and Mitterand ; he embodied the Republic . I knew I 'd be unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs of state are relentless , " President Chavanne said . " The Russian and Tatar Presidents have accepted French mediation . We must not fail . Our reputation as a serious player internationally is at stake . Are you prepared to take over the assignment ? " I was unable to avoid a fawning response . " I will offer nothing less than what Fleury has already given , " I said . " Very good , " said the President . " Jacques , let the Prime Minister know that Monsieur Roland Jolivet will be the new Special Presidential Envoy for Mediation of the Volga Crisis . " " Who knows ? " the President whispered to me . " With success in a high profile matter , what 's to stop you from being named a minister in the next government ? " I felt a touch of vertigo at the sudden prospect of an ascent to a ministerial post , until I realized this was one of Chavanne 's motivational tricks . The President was famous for getting people to do things they did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Jean-Do 's military liaison still in the hospital , I was assigned Brigadier General Hubert Clauzon . I arranged to meet him at one of my favorite lunch spots , Les Trefles . Clauzon , in a freshly pressed uniform , was waiting for me in the private dining room when I arrived . I shook his hand . " You come highly recommended , " I said . " I hope I can be of service , " Clauzon said . " You certainly can . If I 'm alive next year , I 'll send you a thank-you note . " Clauzon smoothed his mustache . " Security for the upcoming trip will be at Level Five . I can go over the arrangements . " " Never mind . " I waved him off . " That 's your line of work . I 'm sure I ca n't give you any pointers . " The sommelier entered with a bottle of 2009 Haut-Batailley I 'd reserved . After I approved the wine , he filled each glass . " My predecessor made very little progress before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a new angle , and you can help . " " How so ? " Clauzon took a sip of wine . I waited for the wine steward to leave before I continued . " The mind field . It 's an exceptional discovery , and a coup for France . " " Indeed . " " So much of the work was done in Toulouse by Besson and his team . To prove that it actually exists , and to vindicate perhaps the greatest Frenchman of all , Descartes . ' I find that thrilling . " " Ah , but Descartes missed the most important fact . " Clauzon set down his glass . " The mind and brain interact through the exchange of energy . " " But for one living at the time of Louis XIII , he was pretty nearly right . " " But what has this to do with the Volga crisis ? " I placed my elbows on the table and leaned forward . " I 've heard  --  do n't ask me from whom - that the funding of mind field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of expanding human knowledge . " A young woman with a gorgeous bust and top security clearance had told me that , but Clauzon did n't need to know . " If you think we have produced a breakthrough weapon , you are mistaken . " I shrugged my shoulders . " A weapon ? No . I 'd have no use for it . You make the war , Hubert . I bring the peace . " The waiter came in and took our order . After he departed , I said , " I 've heard of a device that reproduces the mind field of all living beings within a given space . It can determine what a person is seeing or hearing , smelling , tasting or thinking . I understand one of the applications may be to help in interrogating prisoners . " " You are remarkably well-informed , " Clauzon said . " With these Eastern Europeans being the difficult lot they are , it occurs to me that I 'd reach a settlement more easily if I knew where their bottom lines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that would give you an advantage , but is it proper in the diplomatic field ? " I twirled the stem of my wine glass . " If I can avoid a bloody conflict between Russia and Tatarstan , who can say it 's not proper ? " Clauzon was a bit of a moralist . I found this curious in one who kills for a living . But he agreed to learn more about mind field technology and report back to me . My great fear was that the thing came with a helmet or a bunch of electrodes . How could I persuade the President of Russia to put it on ? What would I tell him - it 's the latest men 's fashion from Galeries Lafayette ? Clauzon got back to me within twenty-four hours . " The device is entirely non-invasive , " he said . " The subject need n't even know of its existence . " " How big is it ? " I asked . " Can it fit in a suitcase ? " " No . It takes up an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it with me , it 's not of much use . " I remained in Paris until the funeral . The President was there , along with the Premier and most of the cabinet . As I watched Jean-Do 's coffin being lowered into the grave , I felt a knot in my stomach that was not just for his sake - I wondered if I might not be the next one placed in French soil . Margherita Fleury looked lovely in a below-the-knee black dress . With my wife Isabelle at my side , I offered condolences . " I 'm so sorry , Margherita . How are you holding up ? " Margherita squeezed my hand , then hugged me , her breasts pressing against my ribs . " Take care , Roland , " Margherita said , her French colored with a light Italian accent . " We do n't want to lose you , too . " Margherita , sobbing , loosened her grip and turned to hug Isabelle . Early the next morning , I flew off in a military jet for Tatarstan , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tatars , the northernmost Muslim nation in the world , live at the same latitude as Denmark . As we descended into Kazan airport , eight hundred kilometers east of Moscow , I had a marvelous view of the Volga . We were met at the airport by the Tatar foreign minister . He invited me to join him in an armored personnel carrier for the short trip to Kazan , the Tatar capital . Along the way , the Tatar official recounted details of the attack which killed Jean-Do . A precision-guided missile struck Jean-Do 's limousine as it neared a lakeside resort where talks were scheduled . " From the wreckage , we 've identified the missile as a Chuikov-3 , " he said in Russian . " This proves Russian army involvement . " " You know as well as I do , " I responded in Russian , " that those missiles could have come from the black market . " " Perhaps , " the foreign minister conceded . I met the Tatar President in his offices in the Kazan Kremlin . Ali Mustafayev , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been living in London for two decades when he was asked to return home to take the Tatar Presidency . Mustafayev had a slim build , with dark hair and vaguely Asiatic features that reminded me of Lenin . " It 's a great honor to meet you , " I said in French . " I once saw you as Don Quixote at the Opera Bastille . " Mustafayev grinned . " It was a very special production for me . Rudolf Nureyev had been Artistic Director of the Paris Opera Ballet . Nureyev was my idol - he was a Tatar of Muslim heritage like me , not a Russian . To dance with what had once been his company was a dream fulfilled . " Mustafayev placed an arm on my shoulder . " Come , let me show you the grounds . " Surrounded by bodyguards , we toured the Kazan Kremlin . " The Russian Kremlin , " " he said , " comes from the Tatar word for " fortress . " When Ivan the Terrible sacked the city in 1552 , this Kremlin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The one that looks a bit like a Chinese pagoda ? " " When Ivan approached , the last Queen of Kazan pitched herself off that tower . " How gruesome these Easterners are , I thought . Of course , we Western Europeans were hardly better . In the Paris of that era , the streets ran red with the blood of thousands of Protestants slain on Saint Bartholomew 's Night . " This is beautiful , " I said , in front of a small mosque with a slender , soaring minaret carved from white stone . As I gazed up at the spire , I nearly expected Rapunzel to let down her long golden hair . " This is the Azimov Mosque , " Mustafayev said . " We 're a Muslim nation , but not extreme . We are Europeans . The Bolshevik Revolution modernized us . " " At tremendous cost . " " Indeed . Nowadays , I prefer the Liberte , Egalite , Fraternite of the French Revolution . " Mustafayev gripped my upper arm tightly . " It took more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this side of the European continent . We wo n't ever give it up again . " In France , I consider a devoted attachment to the French Revolution to be rather passe . Too many guillotines . But Mustafayev nearly had me choked up . I reminded myself not to let sentiment interfere with the affairs of state . The rest of the afternoon passed without incident , and I spent a night at the Kazan Hilton amid tight security . I eased the housekeeping staff 's workload by sharing a bed with Marie-Therese , the delegation 's protocol officer . The next morning , I flew to Sheremetevo Airport in Moscow . An armored limousine picked me up and delivered me to the " other " Kremlin . I met with the Russian leader , Vassily Kovansky , at a luncheon inside the presidential palace . The sumptuous spread included sturgeon and caviar , beef , lamb , and a variety of noodles and potato dishes . " Do n't underestimate us , my friend , " President Kovansky said . The heavy-jowled Kovansky 's blond hair was streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I struggled with at times . " Napoleon once occupied this very Kremlin in which we enjoy this wonderful meal . We did not surrender ; we burned Moscow and retreated deeper into our heartland . Less than three years later , our troops were in Paris . " I wiped my lips with a yellow cloth napkin . " I know it 's difficult to accept a Tatar state within the Russian heartland . But you revoked the treaty recognizing Tatar autonomy within the Federation . You provoked them into declaring independence . " " No , you do n't understand , my friend , " Kovansky said . " The Tatars have been a menace throughout Russian history . They wiped out whole cities . Their leader Batu was the grandson of Genghis Khan . For two hundred years , Russia was under the Tatar yoke , until finally Tsar Ivan destroyed it . " Kovansky snatched a leg of lamb off a serving plate , and bit into it with evident satisfaction . " Tsar Ivan in the West is called terrible . " " Kovansky pronounced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fear are long gone , " I said . " There you are wrong . The symbol of our country is the bear . The bear hibernates . They are hibernating too , waiting to wake up , to turn on Russia again . " Genghis Khan and hibernating bears ! I pursed my lips to avoid snickering . " You 're telling me you are afraid of Mustafayev ? " Kovansky laughed . " Ballet Man ? Of course not . He 's a front . But there are people behind him . " Kovansky glared at me . " No , a Muslim state on the Volga is unthinkable . The river , we call it Matuschka Volga , Mother Volga . You think I 'm going to let some Tatar to have his way with my mother ? " I flew back discouraged . A week later , I was at my Quai d'Orsay office when I received more alarming news . I had General Clauzon up on a big wall-mounted video screen which normally lies hidden behind Second Empire-style drapery . " The Russian army has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , " Clauzon said . " That 's near Nizhny Novgorod , about three hundred kilometers west of Kazan . I 'd say Kovansky wants to intimidate the Tatars . " " Any chance of an actual invasion ? " I asked . " The landscape is flat with no natural obstacles . if they can cross the Volga , there 's not much to stop them from driving straight to Kazan . " I glanced out my window at the golden horses of the Alexander III bridge over the Seine . The last Russian Tsar , Nicholas II , laid the cornerstone to the bridge and named it after his father . In 1918 , Nicholas was shot to death in a cellar in Ekaterinburg , a few hundred kilometers east of Kazan , in Siberia . " Right now , Hubert , I wish I could sneak a peek at Kovansky 's mind field . I might prevent a fatal misunderstanding if I could predict his next move . " Clauzon arched an eyebrow . " You see , Mustafayev hopes Kovansky is bluffing . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dream of independence . If Kovansky intends to invade , and we can prove this - well , I believe Mustafayev will back down rather than have his people butchered by the Russians . " " The Ministry is not prepared , " Clauzon said , " to reveal technical methods to a foreign leader . " " So we mask the origin - we say we have a source inside Kovansky 's circle . " " Okay , " Clauzon said . " If you get Kovansky onto French soil , we can open him up and look inside . " The President of the Republic extended a hastily arranged invitation to Kovansky for a state visit . Three weeks remained until the Russian military exercises . I arranged for the deployment of Clauzon 's gadget through Roux-Levy , the President 's Special Counselor , who said , " The President , while entirely unaware of its use , is fully supportive of your effort " I greeted the Russian President upon his arrival at Charles de Gaulle airport . The limousine delivered us to the courtyard of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the marble entrance hall . After friendly remarks conveyed through a translator , President Chavanne said , " I must rejoin the National Federation of Agriculture meeting in my office . If not , the farmers will drive their tractors onto highways , and block all routes entering Paris . " The Russian president nodded . " I 've had headaches like that too . " " Genevieve will show you about the palace , " President Chavanne said . " I will rejoin you at 14:00 in the Salon Pompadour . " Genevieve Allegre was a young presidential aide with a fine derriere , succulent legs , and , while her bosom resembled the salt flats of the Rhone delta more than the uplands of the Massif Central , she compensated for it with an adorable little nose and scintillating hazel eyes . I momentarily forgot the business at hand as Genevieve led us on a tour of the formal rooms of the Elysee . Kovansky and I were finally able to settle down in armchairs in the Salon Pompadour at 13:30. 1 had in fact carefully arranged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was literally under our feet , filling a private area one floor below . The device would be shut off at 14:00 , when the President of the Republic entered the room . " His secrets must remain his own , " Roux-Levy had said . I tried to get Kovansky to focus his thoughts on the Volga crisis . Unfortunately , his mind was elsewhere . " Genevieve is a beautiful woman , " Kovansky said . " French women are very stylish , how do you say , chic ? " " There are many beautiful women among the Russians , " I said . " But not so chic , right ? " " Paris is the capital of style . " " Russian women look best with their clothes off . With clothes off , there is no chic . Am I right ? " I nodded . " It 's what they 're born with that 's essential . But perhaps we could talk about the Tatars ? " He furrowed his brow . " The Tatar women , I do n't care for . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have Tatar blood . " He tapped a finger on the left side of his face . " The high cheekbones . " " Does n't that suggest a need for peaceful relations between your two peoples ? " " No . It suggests that Russians must be on top . " Kovansky laughed at his little joke . He proceeded to lecture me on the merits of the female population of the various nations of the world . Kovansky had a special fondness for Afghan women , which he developed while serving with Russian forces occupying Afghanistan . He seemed to especially like it when they were unwilling . I found him repellent . It went on like this until the doors opened and President Chavanne entered the room . My only hope , I told myself bitterly , was that while talking about women , Kovansky was really thinking about the Volga crisis . It was forty-eight hours before the results of Kovansky 's mind field scan were available . I drove out to a research facility southwest of Paris in Chatillon , and met Clauzon in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a bare corridor , and entered a soundproof conference room . After we closed the door and sat down , Clauzon cocked his head back and said , " You and Jean-Dominique Fleury 's widow ? Do you think that 's wise ? " I stared at him in amazement . " Jean-Dominique had his liaisons . It 's only fair that Margherita had her own to enjoy . " " It 's not of recent vintage ? " " No . No . To start something so soon after his death would not be right , " I said . " No . It 's of long standing . " Clauzon twisted his wedding ring . " That is better , I suppose . " I sighed . " I wondered whether your machine would catch me. , , " Do n't worry , " Clauzon said . " Compared to Kovansky , you 're Saint Louis . " Not compared to Hubert Clauzon though , I thought . His manner irked me . I needed him , though , so I let the remark pass . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Russian special forces plan to assassinate several Tatar leaders , with the aim of provoking revenge attacks upon the Russian minority in Tatarstan . This will give Kovansky the pretext of turning the forthcoming exercises into an invasion . " " Then we 're dealing with the worst case scenario , " I said . Clauzon stood up and paced around the room . " Kovansky dreams of being a leader on a par with Ivan the Terrible . And he does n't have a high opinion of you , by the way . " I sat up . " What does he think of me ? " Clauzon grinned . " He thinks of you mostly as a French poodle , but sometimes as a wooden puppet with a baguette up your rear . " " Well , I do n't like Monsieur Kovansky either . " I kicked my chair . " But what can I do ? I have to persuade the Tatars to back down , for their own good . " " There 's something else about Monsieur Kovansky . " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed Clauzon down a number of corridors , through several security checks , until we reached an underground room full of electronic equipment . Clauzon introduced me to a slight , dark-haired man in civilian dress . " Dr. Agnelli is the brain behind this project . " We shook hands . " It 's a pleasure to cooperate with the Foreign Ministry , " Dr. Agnelli said . " Let 's take seats in the screening room . I 've created a visual representation of the data . " " You can have a virtual reality experience of Kovansky 's mind field , " Clauzon said , " but I 'm sure you 'll find the video unsettling enough . " " Hubert , did Kovansky order Fleury 's assassination ? " I asked . " He had foreknowledge , " Clauzon said . I felt my chest tighten . " Does he plan to kill me ? " Clauzon shrugged . " It did n't cross his mind during the time we monitored him . " Not an entirely reassuring answer , I thought . We took seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , " Agnelli said . " A mountain has more matter than a human being and therefore more mind , in a purely quantitative sense . But its mind field is incoherent and thus incapable of conscious thought . " As I will be if Kovansky has me killed , I thought . " In the mammalian brain , " he continued , " cyclical electrical flows in the thalamus induce a mind field that is coherent , and therefore conscious . " Conversation ceased as the lights dimmed . An image flashed onto the screen . I recognized Genevieve Allegre of the Elysee Palace staff . This was followed by one of another young woman , and then by Genevieve again . This time she was nude . I told myself this was n't the real Genevieve , only Kovansky 's fantasy , Genevieve 's head with the torso of another woman . Still , I felt aroused . The succeeding image was of a young woman , one with lighter hair than Genevieve . She looked sexy in a red cocktail dress . Her complexion was fresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the wrapper . She seemed to be a teenager trying to appear grown-up . " It gets worse , " Clauzon said . It 's not bad so far , I thought . The image changed subtly . The nude girl was now set against a dark background , her body twisted at an odd angle . Then the girl 's image faded , and we were left with one of a spade shoved into the ground next to an open pit . I felt my stomach turn . " Is this a memory or a fantasy ? " I asked . The gruesome image on the screen was replaced by one of a brandy glass . " Bring back that shot of the grave , " Clauzon said . The image returned to the screen . " Do you see the faint line ten degrees below the moon ? " Clauzon asked . " Yes . " " On the hunch that it was a ridge line , I had our mapping unit compare its shape to terrain contours taken from satellite images . " " And ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The image of a mountain range unfamiliar to me was placed on the screen . It fit perfectly against the jagged line from Kovansky 's mind field . " Sochi , " Clauzon said . " The Black Sea resort ? " " The ridge is a section of the North Caucasus above Sochi . Kovansky has owned a series of dachas in the Sochi region , moving from one to another more luxurious as his influence expanded . " " You 've outdone yourself , Hubert , " I shook my head in amazement . " Thanks to Dr. Agnelli , " Clauzon said , nodding in his direction . " Is there any way we could verify this on the ground ? " I asked . " Yes , but that would require special authorization . " " I can get that for you , " I said . With blessings from on-high , a special intelligence unit was dispatched to the Caucasus . Meanwhile , a bomb placed in a trash can exploded in central Kazan , killing one and injuring thirty-four . Speaking on a secure line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement in the attack , but asked him not to retaliate . " It would jeopardize new developments , " I said , " about which I must be necessarily vague . " When I finally got the word from Clauzon , I rushed over to his ministry . On his desk was a thighbone , encased in clear plastic . " From the backyard of a dacha owned by Monsieur Kovansky until seven years ago , " Clauzon said . " We made a video of the entire exhumation . " " Ugh ! This guy really is in the tradition of Stalin and Ivan . " " We 've identified the victim . Her name was Olga Shelepin . " " Any relation to Major General Yuri Shelepin ? " " His daughter . " " My God , are you sure ? " " The Russians have a data bank which records DNA samples for all their military personnel for identification in case of death . Unofficially , we have access to that . " I glanced out the window at a young gendarme on duty with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for military service . " " She was fifteen when she disappeared . But her father was and is in the military . He and Kovansky were helicopter gunship pilots in Afghanistan . They were closely associated for many years afterward . " " You 've been able to tie this sample to her father 's DNA " " Within a probability of one in ten thousand million . " " Shelepin is a mean bastard , I hear . Do you think he might know about Kovansky 's role ? " " His daughter 's room has been left untouched since she disappeared . " Clauzon handed me a reprint of an article from a Smolensk newspaper . " As to what Shelepin would do to his daughter 's murderer , I would n't want to be that man . " I traveled to Moscow ten days before the military exercises were to take place . During his meeting with President Chavanne at the Elysee , Kovansky had agreed to further talks . Back on his home turf in the Kremlin , however , he was if anything less flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be judged a failure in Paris . At least I have the holidays on the Cdte d'Azur to look forward to . " " I hear it 's delightful . " Kovansky was pleased to change the topic . " My family spends much of the summer in Antibes . I try to join them for three weeks in August . I understand you like to spend time at the seashore , too . Sochi , right ? " " You 've been well-briefed , " Kovansky said . Casually reaching into my briefcase for a pen , I said , " Your friend Major General Shelepin has a dacha there as well . " " He used to . He does n't go to Sochi anymore . " " His daughter disappeared there , did n't she ? That would account for it . It would bring back bad memories . " " Yes , " Kovansky said in an unruffled tone . " They never heard from her again ? " " Not to my knowledge , " Kovansky said . " Perhaps she was kidnapped by a Tatar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If she was kidnapped and even murdered , it would be more reasonable to assume it was done by someone known to her , perhaps a trusted family friend like yourself . " " Your joke is not amusing , " Kovansky said in a near-whisper . " Perhaps she lies even now covered by a meter or two of earth in the backyard of some dacha in Sochi . " " Our meeting is finished . " Kovansky rose to his feet . " We all have our little secrets , things we would n't want others , even our closest friends , to know about . " I closed my briefcase . Kovansky stepped toward me . " Say what you mean . " " In France , we have a secret service known as the DGSE , " I said . " It 's their job to know your secrets . " I thought I observed a moment of hesitation in Kovansky 's eyes . " The DGSE ? Did n't they blow up the ship of those stupid environmentalists - " " Greenpeace , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear testing in the South Pacific . " " It was not their best moment , I grant you . " " On the contrary , that 's when I began to respect the French . " I smiled involuntarily . " The best secret service , in my opinion , is the one you never hear about . The one that can keep a secret . " " That 's true . " " Ours can keep a secret , your secret , if sufficiently motivated . " " For instance .... " " If you would recognize Tatarstan as an independent state and pledge not to take any aggressive action against it . " Kovansky lunged at me , grabbed my briefcase and swung it at me . I stepped out of the way . " You think you have me , do n't you ? Well , you 're mistaken , and if you do n't leave here soon , I 'm not responsible for what might happen to you .

" I left immediately for Sheremetevo Airport . While awaiting clearance to take off , however , my jet was asked to return to the gate . I was met by a courier bearing a message from Kovansky , requesting that I return to the Kremlin one last time . Had he changed his mind ? I doubted it . Perhaps on the way back my car would be involved in a fatal " accident . " Would he really risk killing me in Moscow , where his fingerprints would be so apparent ? I decided to chance it . I made it to the Kremlin safely , but to my dismay , I was not brought in to see Kovansky . Instead , I was handed a padded envelope and shunted into a small room with electronic equipment . The envelope contained a video disk . I popped the disk into a video player mounted on the wall . At first I thought it was one of Kovansky 's twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thralls of passion .

I could even see a rather large mole on my back , of which I 'd not been previously aware . This was Kovansky 's attempt to balance the scales . A quid pro quo . I protect his secret , he protects mine . I pulled the video disk out of the player and slipped it into my briefcase . Then I broke out into audible laughter . He actually thought he could blackmail me with a sex video . I wished Jean-Do were alive . He 'd have gotten a kick out of it . Kovansky had spent too much time in the backward parts of Europe .

" I take it you do not care whether this becomes public or not ? " " It will only enhance my reputation . " He stood up suddenly . " Pffh ! I told him it would n't work .

" I wondered what was the likelihood of reaching Paris alive if I turned down the offer . If , on the other hand , I took the money , I 'd only be doing what many politicians regularly do . " Merely to stay neutral in the conflict between Russia and Tatarstan . To take a hands-off approach , and certainly to make sure that any information that would reflect poorly upon Russia or its President not be disclosed . " " I see . And a hands-off approach , I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a peaceful settlement of their outstanding issues ? " " The money will be provided in three installments , " Ogarev said . " One million up front . One million euros in three months . The final 2.2 million in nine months , should everything go as promised . " " When do you need an answer ? " " At once . " I reflected briefly . " Make it five million , " I said . " Done , " said Ogarev . I do n't believe I 'd have made it back to my plane if I had n't agreed to take the money ; I 'd dickered over the price in order to win his confidence . Once I was airborne , I placed a call to the Foreign Minister and informed him of the bribe . He agreed that we would play along with it for the time being , while Clauzon pursued a back channel to General Shelepin . A few days later , when an attach6 from the Russian embassy passed me a sealed envelope with the number of the Swiss bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance . On the eve of the Russian military exercises threatening Kazan , Kovansky flew out to be with his troops . His Brusilov-330 never made it to the staging area in Pavlovo . Residents of Tumbotino reported hearing a large explosion ; wreckage was located three kilometers south of town . In the immediate aftermath , the military exercises were canceled . Initial press reports suggested that " Tatar terrorists " were responsible . But a board of inquiry determined that Kovansky himself was at the controls when the plane got into trouble . Kovansky , a qualified pilot , was known to have taken the controls on previous flights . This time , however , he reportedly made an approach despite localized thunderstorms and fell short of the runway . The findings were widely accepted . After all , the chair of the board of inquiry was someone perceived to be close to Kovansky - Major General Yuri Shelepin . Enough time has passed and enough of the major players have passed on , that I may now reveal General Shelepin 's own role in the affair . Shelepin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disappearance were awakened by our agents . He proved quite eager to cooperate . Kovansky 's Brusilov-330 took off with a faulty navigational system . It would have crashed no matter who was piloting the plane . After Kovansky 's death , I was able to broker a deal between the new President of Russia and the President of Tatarstan . The old treaty that Kovansky had renounced was revived , with amendments related to mineral rights and the rights of ethnic minorities . Neither side was fully satisfied by the outcome , but that 's what negotiation is about . The bribe was returned to the Russian treasury . Sometimes , when I glance about our apartment on the Boulevard Raspail with its faded elegance , I wonder what five million euros might have done for its appearance . Still , I have few regrets . I 've had the undeserved support of a very tolerant wife . I 've enjoyed the career that Jean-Dominique Fleury might have had , had he lived . I think he 'd be satisfied with what I 've made of it , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic sphere .
