##in our church . Just as I was going to give her a call , she showed up at Mass . We started attending Thursday meetings together , and I came to Elizabeth 's home for some extra catechism . She named me her sponsor , and she was baptized at the Easter Vigil . In these bad times I have learned to be more humble , generous , and patient . It is only fitting that these bad times came during Lent , a time for introspection and renewal . Conquering guilt Ralph Ranieri Ocala , Fla . I was a mess . Full of scruples at 12 years old , I kept thinking that I was always committing mortal sins . I could not control my thoughts , and that made me feel like I was sinning even more . On top of this I was afraid of everything and everybody . On the outside I was leading a normal life , but even at 12 1 knew that I was not living life , much less enjoying it . It was too complicated to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I thought were abnormal behaviors . I was an altar boy at that time . Since I lived across the street from church , I was called to serve almost every function when no one else was available . Serving Stations of the Cross one afternoon , I heard the answer . At each station the priest recited , " Grant that I may love Thee always and then do with me what you will . " At the fourth station it hit me . I still remember kneeling there as these words went straight to my heart . I do n't believe in lightning bolts , but these words , even at 12 years old , told me that I was free . AU I had to do was trust God . His love would take care of any inadvertent sin , and his providence would see me through any fears . My life changed visibly . I was so peaceful . I now enjoyed life thoroughly . Today at 68 1 am still full of peace . I had a few bouts with obsessions and compulsions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . Giving care takes prayer Dartene Mauro Freehold , NJ . The doctor led us into a separate room ; I knew that meant bad news . The surgery was a success , he said , " but we had a little problem when we tried to wake him up . " A little problem ? My father , who the day before had purchased a new golf club , may never walk again . The words were blurred : stroke , paralysis , weakness . It 's hard to hear when your mother is sobbing . This " little problem " would test our resolve , our family , and our faith . How could a loving God allow this to happen to a man who was so good and so faithful ? Dad 's condition improved at first , but he suffered setback after setback . I found myself praying one day and yelling at God the next . I was angry , I was hurt , I was in complete doubt of a superior being . My time was no longer my own : trips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then head home , make dinner , and go to work . I had little time with my own family , and I felt my faith eroding . I was exhausted , drained physically and emotionally . I did n't want to go to church and began praying less . I basically felt completely removed from the God I believed in . Dad asked me to join him for a visit with the psychiatrist one day . The psychiatrist asked my father a few questions : " What do you do when you start to feel down ? " He answered , " I look at my wife who is standing by my side and realize how lucky I am . " " And when that does n't work , what do you do ? " she asked . " I look at my children and grandchildren and realize how much I still have and how lucky I am , " he said . Again she asked , " And when that does n't work ? " He said , " I pray . " One more time she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you do n't pray right , " he said simply . At that moment with tears welling in my eyes and chills running down my spine , I realized that this strong man , though physically diminished , had it all because he still believed . Thanks given Eva Bogaardt Moorpark , Calif . Something was wrong . Wally 's face was drawn , his head bowed . No hello , no kiss on the cheek , he went straight upstairs and crumpled into a ball on the edge of our bed , a crushed and broken man . I sat down to him and waited . After what seemed like hours , he mumbled , " I lost my job . " I laid my arm across his back to draw him into a hug . " It 's OK , " I said , wondering if I could believe my own words . " We 'll be fine . " I had just buried my mother and was dealing with a runaway teen , but " we 'll be fine . " I did n't ask Wally why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other crosses that had been laid upon our family . The children , at least , were in bed , including my " number five is alive " runaway . Silently we undressed and slid under the bed covers . Crying hurts . By morning my throat was sore and my mind worn out . I knew we needed help fast . I would n't be able to feed the nine kids air , so I called Ruben , head of the Catholic Charities office where I volunteered . " I ca n't help with rent , " he said , " but I can cover your utility bills for a couple of months . " By Thanksgiving I had exhausted our meager savings and the money friends from Wally 's work had offered . I 'd broken down spiritually , too . The burden too heavy , I mindlessly repeated to the kids what my mother had taught me : " Do n't worry , God will come through . " Two days before the big holiday , I sat counting pennies wondering if I could buy a turkey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector . Instead there stood Father Joe , grinning and red-faced from carrying a huge box full of food , a 15-pound turkey on top . My eyes stung as I held back joy . " Oh , Father , please thank the parish families for us . " Within days I found an unmarked envelope in the mailbox . It contained $1,000. 1 could pay the rent again . Just after Christmas my husband regained his job . God came through alright . My faith was restored in God and awakened to the community of believers who supported us through the worst of times . A parting gift Pat McDonough Westbury , N.Y . On the day my mother died , I sat next to her bed praying the rosary as she moved in and out of consciousness . My mind wandered back to the years when she sat on the edge of my bed , teaching me to pray , lulling me to sleep . A lifetime later , the rosary was her lullabye , and her sleep would be eternal . My mother 's hands looked bare without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I weaved them through her fingers and wrapped my hands around hers while I whispered the rosary into her ear . It was n't easy . Unlike mom , who held tightly to traditional devotions , my pilgrim soul led me in different directions . Truth is , I had forgotten how to pray the rosary , but in the last moments of my mother 's life , I discovered that this prayer - and maybe all prayer - was more than a sum of its words . The rosary helped my mother escape the limits of illness . From the boundaries of her bed , she continued to connect to the community of faith that had nourished her for a lifetime . We moved more deeply into the Paschal Mystery as I prayed our way through the mysteries of the rosary with the help of a book . While her response to my words was barely noticeable , the monitors indicated that her heart rate , her pulse , and her breathing changed while we prayed Our Lady 's prayer . And every now and then , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . The life of our Lord , told by the beads , the mysteries of joy , sorrow , glory , and light , paralleled the mystery of my mother 's life and of all our lives really . Even in the pain , the sadness , and silence of her last weeks , prayer had the power to reach beyond what I could see , beyond what the doctors label life . Her tear assured me that prayer is powerful . It continues to transform us , even as the mystery of life and death become one in the Paschal Mystery . Prayer matters more than I had ever imagined . Perhaps that was her parting gift . Today when I pray the rosary , I think back to the way our hands enfolded the beads that are buried with her today .

Perhaps we question why , or we simply lose time for God . Just when we are at our lowest , though , the smallest gesture can remind us that God is still with us . For our second Meditation Room , we asked readers to tell us about how faith helped them through the hard times in their lives . They responded with stories of prayer , community , love , and hope . Despite their personal troubles and the current state of our world and country , U.S. Catholic readers find God all around us. - The Editors Getting up is enoughs Suzanne M. Pearson Rochester , N.Y . Our 25-year-old daughter developed a painful , degenerative , crippling , and incurable autoimmune disease as a toddler .

Our family has lived the Paschal Mystery for 22 years . Our daughter 's latest medical problems hit me pretty hard . I 've struggled with depression , and my customary devotional practices had fallen by the wayside . Though in ' seminary , I was feeling doubly guilty about both my feelings of despair and the lack of fervor in my faith right now .

I laughed when I realized that God did not demand I be anything other than what I am in this present moment A burden was lifted . Psalm 23 reminds me that though we walk through the darkest valley , God is with us and for us . In an age when much Christian spirituality denies the reality of the suffering that is part of this life 's journey- essentially abandoning people in their pain- my faith comforts me with the assurance that our suffering is not meaningless , that our gentle Shepherd walks by our sides through it , and it is not the last word . We , too , will one day share with him a life free from suffering and death . When it rains , it pours Sandra A. M. Steiner Portland , Ore . We 're used to rain in the Northwest , but we had a personal deluge in 2005 . It began on a January night , when a close relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her admitted to a locked hospital ward . That same evening an old friend reappeared , clearly unaware that she had become an alcoholic . All the while , we were reckoning with the observation that our fourth child was losing developmental skills . The undercurrent was my husband 's work , where a promotion promised by a boss evaporated when that boss was replaced . Then there was that funny noise under the fridge coming from a detestable furry thing . Our fears about our child were compounded by the bad news that his orthopedic problem had recurred . He would need surgery on both of his legs and a wheelchair for three months . That news brought with it a flood of fear and doubt , and we ques- tioned the opinion of our surgeon . Then the real flood came- 3,000 gallons of water from the improper draining of a neighbor 's pool flowed through the only finished portion of our basement . It was only June ! What more ? I told God I was sure he had a reason for all this character building , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After our second consultation with our child 's surgeon , " something " told me to stop by the parish center . It was as though God was taking hold of the steering wheel and literally guiding me there . When Kris at the parish office asked how I was , I told all : family mental health issues , loss of a friend to alcoholism , the doubt about my ability to maintain a safe and rodent-free home , the job issues , the flood , and my son 's surgery . She gave me a hug and said the most profound words : " You 're not alone . Let us help you . " She then asked if she could put our son and family on the parish prayer circle . Despite continued challenges with home repair and a rocky recovery from surgery , from then on , we felt a lightness , that our burdens were not being borne by us alone , but through prayers of a faith-filled community . Kris was right that we were not alone , and the help we received was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape Coral , FIa . Bad and good times are natural occurrences . The manifestation of God and his merciful will is in everything that happens to us . I rediscovered this recently as I 've been hit with furlough days at my job with the possibility of a permanent layoff , the loss of my retirement savings , a house that I ca n't sell , and the prospect of increasing debt . All this may seem bad , but I 've taken it as a blessing . Through it all I 've realized that I had fallen into the same greed and consumerism that is breaking this nation apart , while overlooking my sense of purpose as a Christian . I had been helping a fellow parishioner , Elizabeth , prepare for the sacrament of Baptism . Elizabeth came from Cuba five years ago . She did n't know how to make the sign of the cross but was overcome when I told her she could be baptized . This turned out to be easier said than done . We attended another church 's RCIA program in Spanish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholicism . We decided to do a one-on-one coaching instead . I quit after two meetings . True , I had a lot of pressure on me at work , and my budget became tight . True , I had put my house up for sale and had to show it to agents at odd times . I seemingly did n't have time for Elizabeth , but the truth is I did not want to face the challenge of preparing a catechumen on my own or attending the group meetings with her . Here I was a devoted Catholic , happily involved with my church , yet forgetting the reason why I was so dedicated . At Confession I realized that the fear of losing material goods was taking precedence over Elizabeth 's initiation
