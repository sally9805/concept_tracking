With the peace process falling apart , the last thing Israel needs is civil war . But that is what it almost had in its Arab neighborhoods and towns during the past two weeks . Israel 's Arab minority rioted in the Galilee and in major cities like Jaffa and Haifa . Jewish mobs responded with attacks of their own . " Coexistence between Arabs and Jews in Israel has started to collapse , " says Salah Tarif , a Druze Arab member of Prime Minister Ehud Barak 's One Israel party . <P> The problem is that the 1 million citizens Israel calls Israeli Arabs tend to think of themselves as Palestinians who happen to live in Israel , not as Israelis of Arab descent . It 's a crucial distinction and has always been a potential trigger . At the best of times it is a source of friction . In the midst of last week 's chaos , it was a spark for some real tragedy . <P> On the eve of Yom Kippur , two Sundays ago , Azmi Bishara heard on a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Bishara , a member of parliament from Nazareth , advocates an end to Israel 's Jewish character in favor of " a state of all its citizens . " He rushed home to evacuate his pregnant wife and two-year-old daughter , and at midnight a crowd gathered outside his home and stoned it . " Imagine if Arabs had attacked the house of a Jewish member of parliament , " says Bishara . " They would have shot them . At my house , the police were just trying to persuade the mob nicely to go home . " And there were other stories . In Tel Aviv , a mob torched a restaurant after locking its Arab kitchen staff inside . Police had to fight off rioters to free the busboys . <P> The government fears more outbursts of violence from both sides of the religious divide  --  meaning Israel itself could be turned into a real battleground . Television stations did not broadcast the full footage of two Israeli soldiers being lynched by Palestinians in the West Bank , out of concern that it would prompt reprisals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very ugly situation , " says Bishara . " Here , in this democracy , you have to fear for your life because of your ethnicity . " <P>  --  By Matt Rees/Jerusalem
