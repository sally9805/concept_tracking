Among all the things that drive stock prices , basic market psychology is the hardest to figure . Are you a bull or a bear ? For many investors , the answer is based on little more than a gut-level premonition of where stocks are headed . Yet market psychology , or sentiment , can with little prodding shift so decisively to one side of the fear/greed spectrum that it dictates the course of stock prices for months or even years . <P> Years ? No one frets about herd behavior when it 's the bulls who have everyone brainwashed  --  as was the case last year . Who did n't enjoy that historic 86% jump in the NASDAQ ? The gain overwhelmed economic fundamentals , though . Fueled by our faith in technology and the riches minted in previous years , mass psychology swung to the greed side , and stocks were viewed as a bargain at any price . <P> Now we 're paying in flesh  --  the fear side . Amid unprecedented and treacherous trading volatility , the NASDAQ has fallen nearly 40% in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of latecomers . That 's why it 's best to have both bulls and bears striking a balance  --  to keep stocks tethered to reality . Lose that equilibrium , and you get boom , bust , pain . <P> Other than market psychology  --  now as gloomy as it was bubbly  --  not much has changed . Sure , short-term interest rates are rising , and dot-bombs are exploding like a string of very expensive firecrackers . But that 's been going on for a year . The real explanation is the sharp reversal in sentiment , which is reflected in hundreds , if not thousands , of stocks whose every decline goes a little lower and every bounce falls a little short of full recovery . People buying the dips are getting killed . <P> The negative psychology  --  the fear  --  is further evidenced by how investors react to news . Before the spring sell-off , even bad news was a reason to buy because such an announcement cleared away any reason to sell . Now stocks like Cisco and Hewlett-Packard are falling even on exceptional earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic goes , there 's nothing left to keep the stock up . Better sell . The scary thing is that there is no way to tell how long this irrational gloominess will rule . Investors should come to grips with the possibility that we have entered an old-fashioned bear market  --  one that lasts six to nine months before reaching bottom , is marked by frequent suckers ' rallies that pull bargain hunters in too early , and fails to recover quickly off the bottom . Give me a crash anytime ; the next day is a buying opportunity . A slow bloodletting demoralizes . It does n't end until the dip buying stops , and by the time you realize that 's happened , you 've missed a huge rebound . <P> We may not come to that . When the Fed is about done raising rates , which could be soon , market psychology will improve . But the way the economy is growing , there 's a good case for rate increases extending well into next year , and that 's a bear-market recipe . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock tables . Stay diversified . Keep contributing to your 401(k) plan . Dollar-cost-average into favorite blue chips and funds . In five years , you 'll be happy you bought cheap . Investing is a long-term game . That 's been easy to forget . But now it 's impossible not to remember . <P> See
