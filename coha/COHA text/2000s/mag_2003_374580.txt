Cosmology is sometimes pooh-poohed as more philosophy than science . It asks deep questions about nature but provides unsatisfyingly vague answers . The cosmos may be 12 billion years old , but it could be as much as 15 billion . The stars began to shine 100 million years after the Big Bang , or maybe it 's a billion . " Our ideas , " acknowledges Max Tegmark of the University of Pennsylvania , " have been kind of wobbly . " <P> But much of the wobble has been fixed , thanks to a satellite known as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe , or WMAP . Since July 2001 , WMAP has been orbiting in deep space , a million miles from Earth , studying the most ancient light in existence . And in a dramatic reminder that important space science is almost always done by machines , not fragile humans , it reported a series of precision measurements last week that will finally put cosmology on a firm foundation . <P> What the satellite found , says Princeton University 's David Spergel , a theorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be explained with five numbers . " First , the cosmos is 13.7 billion years old , give or take a negligible couple of hundred million years . Second , the first stars turned on just 200 million years after the Big Bang . Finally , the universe is made of three things in the following proportions : 4% ordinary atoms ; 23% " dark matter , " whose nature is still unknown ; and 73% " dark energy , " the equally mysterious force whose antigravity effect is speeding up the cosmic expansion . " This , " says astrophysicist John Bahcall , of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J. , " is a rite of passage for cosmology , from speculation to precision science . " <P> WMAP learned this and more by scrutinizing the faint whisper of microwaves left over from the Big Bang . Hidden in that radiation are patterns of warmer and cooler spots , marking places where matter was a little more or less dense than average  --  spots that would eventually evolve into the clusters of galaxies and empty spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crude form by the Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) satellite in 1992 , but without enough detail for much to be said about them . <P> But with a resolution some 40 times as sharp as COBE 's , WMAP has plenty to say . ( The W was added last week in honor of David Wilkinson , the Princeton physicist who helped launch the project but died last summer . ) " It 's a lot like matching fingerprints , " says Spergel . " We ran computer simulations based on many different values for all of the numbers , generated patterns for each and found the one that best matched what we actually saw . " <P> WMAP also confirmed what earlier experiments had suggested about a basic characteristic of the universe : the geometry of space-time , in the Einsteinian sense , is flat . That 's consistent with a theory called inflation , which posits that the cosmos underwent a period of turbocharged expansion before it was a second old . " I have to admit , " says Bahcall , " that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark matter , dark energy  --  it 's all pretty implausible . But this implausible , crazy universe has now been confirmed with exquisite detail . "
