Headnote Whether you 're a complete novice or an old hand , follow these directions and we guarantee you the biggest and best harvest you 've ever had . Nine square feet and a single seed . That 's all you need to grow as many juicy , vine-ripened , BLT-perfect tomatoes as you can eat in a season . But if you are like most gardeners , you want a bounty of luscious beefsteaks , saucers , cherries , and more to share with family and friends , make into salsa , and put up in jars of sauce . I 've gathered the hints and tricks that have proven themselves season after season in our test gardens into this guide that takes you from planting to picking . Choosing Picking a few varieties from among the hundreds available is a real challenge . We 've named a few best bets on page 63 . But before you even look at a variety , you have a few choices to make . Heirlooms vs. hybrids . Heirlooms are often not as productive as hybrids , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one season to the next , eventually breeding a variety that is perfectly suited to your conditions . Most heirlooms are " indeterminate " types , meaning they grow long , sprawling vines and produce tomatoes continuously through the season . Hybrids , on the other hand , often have disease-resistance that heirlooms lack . You can tell what diseases a hybrid can withstand by the letters after its name on the plant tag . For example , VFFNTA means the plant is resistant to Verticillium wilt , Fusarium races 1 and z , root-knot Nematodes , Tobacco mosaic virus , and Alternaria stem canker . That 's a good choice if diseases have knocked out your tomatoes in the past . Early start . To extend your tomato-harvesting season , plant one or two early-ripening varieties . These are often " determinate " types , meaning they produce all at once and have shorter , less rangy vines . When buying a six-pack of seedlings to transplant to your garden , look for clean , dark green foliage and a sturdy habit . If the bottom leaves are yellow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for aphids and other pests . The healthiest , most productive plants start out unstressed and pest-free . Planting Do n't rush to plant . Getting a tomato plant into the ground when the soil is cold just causes it to turn purple ( purple foliage means the plant ca n't take up phosphorus ) . Wait a week or two after the average last-frost date . Plant deep , up to the first set of leaves . Tomatoes develop adventitious roots-roots that originate from the buried stem . A bigger and broader root system helps the plant support a heavy load of fruit . Space plants about 3 feet apart , unless you 're using the stake-and-weave support system ( see page 62 ) . The Soil Your tomato patch needs to fit the following description : Well-drained . If the soil stays soggy where you want to plant , build a raised bed . Sunny . Tomato plants need at least 8 hours of sunlight a day , or they get spindly and produce little mature fruit . Fresh . Most tomato diseases reside in the soil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops . To break the disease cycle , starve the disease-causing organisms by rotating susceptible vegetables with unrelated ones , such as beans or lettuce . Making Your Bed Tomatoes grow best in slightly acidic soil ( pH 6.2 to 6.8 ) . If you suspect your soil is n't , get a soil test and amend accordingly . Two ways to ensure that your tomato bed is full of beneficial soil organisms and plant nutrients : Add compost . Fork the soil to a depth of 1 foot and add two shovelfuls of compost to each planting hole . This improves drainage , increases soil fertility , and helps the soil hold water . Grow a cover crop . Plant a grain or legume crop-sometimes called green manure-for the purpose of chopping it down and adding it to the soil . One tried-and-true way is to plant hairy vetch ( a nitrogen-fixing legume ) in your garden bed in fall . In spring , cut it down and plant your tomatoes in holes you carve through the matted residue and stubble . This provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Water Fertilizer . Don Boekelheide , our test gardener in Charlotte , North Carolina , scratches a 5-3-3 organic fertilizer and a handful of rock phosphate into the soil around his tomato plants twice during the growing season-once when the plant is a foot tall , and again when it flowers . Spraying your plants with a fish emulsion or kelp solution two or three times a season also boosts vigor , which helps the vines outgrow diseases . Water . Give your plants an inch of water each week when it does n't rain to prevent fruit from cracking or developing blossom-end rot . The most efficient method is a drip system or inexpensive soaker hose . Weed Control Mulch suppresses weeds and conserves moisture . Any mulch is better than none , but a comparison study done by the USDA in Beltsville , Maryland , showed that tomatoes mulched with mown vetch ( see " Grow a Cover Crop , " page 60 ) produced especially robust root systems and outperformed those mulched with plastic . We recommend a 3- to 4-inch layer of dried clippings , leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which decompose and feed soil organisms-over plastic . Clear or IRT ( infrared transmitting ) plastic mulches make sense where summers are short , because they warm the soil . Companions Tomatoes love carrots . And onions , and basil , and marigolds . A neat row of " Summerlong " basil or triple curled parsley looks nice and makes for an efficient use of space . West Coast contributing editor Willi Evans Galloway used the shady spot created by her tomato plants as a nursery bed for lettuce seedlings in her Seattle garden last summer . Support Systems Stake or cage plants while they are small , so you do n't damage branches or roots . At the Organic Gardening Test Garden , we 've found these methods effective : **25;354;TOOLONG cages . We build them 5 feet high and 2 to 3 feet in diameter . The welded steel mesh supports even the largest plants . Until , that is , they are laden with fruit and a gust of wind whips through . Experience has taught us that weaving 8-foot bamboo poles horizontally through the cages about 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps them upright . Debbie Leung , our Washington State test gardener , uses similar reinforcing poles but attaches them to metal T-stakes , driven into the ground between every fourth cage . Stake-and-weave trellising . The plants are held up between lengths of twine woven between parallel rows of stakes ( see photo , below left ) . You can harvest more and earlier tomatoes from a limited area by spacing plants 1 to 2 feet apart ( instead of 3 feet ) and pounding a 6-foot stake into the ground between every other plant . As the plants grow , weave baling twine in and out of stakes and tomatoes . Do this four to six times over the growing season . John Good of Quiet Creek Farm , near Kutztown , Pennsylvania , prefers this method because it ensures good air circulation . It also makes harvesting easier . Prune or Not ? Researchers at Purdue University found that pruning ( by removing the branches , or " suckers , " below the first main stem ) increased the average fruit weight in some cases , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If you stake and weave , prune the lower suckers for better air circulation ; if planting in an ornamental garden , prune suckers for neatness . Don Boekelheide ( our tester in North Carolina ) prunes vigorous indeterminates to two main stems early in the season to keep them from taking over his Southern garden . Harvest Time Check your plants daily , and pick tomatoes by gently twisting the fruits from the vine when they 're at the peak of their color and slightly soft to the touch . The best-tasting tomatoes have a balanced ratio of sugar to acid , and the sugars increase as the fruit colors , according to Purdue University researchers . Tomatoes that ripen during longer days have more sugar than those that mature in the shorter days of late summer . For best flavor , store them at temperatures above 50F .

Sidebar Pot of sunshine : Even with a surplus of summer rain , our small- to medium-size tomatoes were crack-free-and perfect for snacking while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-fertile perfect flowers , meaning that each flower has both male and female parts and only one plant is needed for fruit . Bees ( mostly wild bees , not honeybees ) assist in pollination by shaking the pollen loose , then spreading it from flower to flower and plant to plant . Sidebar Tomato teamwork : When you see white wasp cocoons on the back of a tomato hornworm ( top left ) , the pest 's garden-munching days are numbered . The tiny parasitic wasps that lay their eggs on the caterpillar are your allies , and along with well-anchored cages and single-layer harvest boxes , they help you enjoy the tastiest , most blemish-free tomatoes you 've ever grown . MASTER 'S TIP Seed crimson clover under tomato plants when they are about 2 feet tall . The clover serves as a weed-smothering " living mulch " while fixing nitrogen into its root nodules . NEWBIE HINT Transplant nursery-bought seedlings into larger pots . Let them size up , and then plant outdoors a week or two after the last-frost date , when the soil is warm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cages , or prop vines between lengths of twine strung from post to post . Your plants will benefit from better air circulation . Sidebar Summer cover : A layer of shredded newspaper , straw , or grass clippings under tomatoes saves you time on weeding and watering , and can even prevent blossom-end rot .

But in the event you do have a problem , turn to our handy problem-solving guide ( on page 65 ) that you can tear out and save to refer to later . Common Problems Solved 1 Tomato hornworm . Handpick and squash the caterpillars , but spare those that carry the white cocoons of braconid wasps on their backs . The wasps are their natural predators ; to attract them , plant dill , and let your cilantro flower . 2 Catfacing . Caused by incomplete pollination in cold weather . Do n't plant too early . Select varieties that resist catfacing. 3 Cracking . Caused by sudden summer rains after dry periods . Provide consistent moisture . Look for varieties that are resistant to cracking . 4 Blossom-end rot . Caused by poor calcium uptake due to inconsistent moisture . Provide consistent moisture with a soaker hose , and keep a layer of mulch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fungus that is favored by wet weather . Spores travel great distances and can cause plants and fruit to suddenly rot . Avoid crowding . If the infection is severe and widespread , remove and destroy all affected plants . 6 Wilts . Fusarium and Verticillium fungi cause branches to wilt , and can kill the plant over time . Look for resistant varieties . Rotate crops . Southern bacterial wilt results in sudden plant death . Remove and destroy all debris , and do not plant tomatoes where the disease has occurred in the past . 7 Early blight . Caused by a fungus that survives the winter on old vines . Remove diseased foliage from the plant and dispose of it . Avoid crowding and prune for good air circulation . Rotate crops . 8 Root-knot nematodes . Microscopic eelworms that live in soil cause stunted growth . Look for resistant varieties . Rotate tomatoes with marigolds , tilling the marigolds into the soil at the end of the season . <p>                  @ @ @
