There were mugs to cradle in the hand and bowls broad enough to hold a harvest-vessels with sturdy souls enlivened by quirks of ornamentation . There was also sculpture in which she demonstrates her ability to find the lyrical in everyday forms-a stack of bath soap or a Sunbeam iron . The overall effect was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been to dovetail functional work with sculpture , " the California artist explains . " I thought for a long time I should choose one or the other , but I need to do both . I do n't want to limit myself to teapots and not have a full experience . I also do n't want to make sculpture that looks like dead pots . Fortunately , day allows an intersection between sculpture and painting . " That intersection is wonderfully expressed in the latest work , in which Massaro gives ordinary fruit a second skin . Persimmons , mangoes , melons and avocados , cast in porcelain from real produce , lie in casual groupings or vertiginous towers in these sculptural assemblages . Their surfaces are covered with whimsical decoration-checks , dots , herringbone tweed-executed in glaze and china paint . The patterns emphasize the sensual curves and shadows of the fruit , its shapes and masses . The forms are recognizable , the rendering of their skins a surprise . As Massaro puts it , they are " the real juxtaposed with its abstraction . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought I would make nice brown pots of good taste , " she says , recalling her student days . Her search for essential form is a motivation straight from childhood . Her father was a Danish-born and-trained furniture designer who arrived in the United States from Copenhagen in 1946 . He eventually opened his own studio and worked for a contract design firm in New York . " My upbringing was Bauhaus , " she says . " It was all about that sense of line . " Her mother , also Danish , was a housewife who impressed upon her children a love of art , music and literature , even as she excelled at domestic arts like knitting and tailoring . The textures of stitched and knitted fabric echo today in the decoration of Massaro 's fruit sculptures . Massaro earned a B.S. in art education from SUNY Buffalo , then an M.F.A. at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , in 1972 , when " there was a lot of excitement about clay , a lot of exploration , " she says . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown pots , goblets with deep , earthy glazes and mugs with relief designs indicative of late-i96os style . It did n't take long for her to push convention , literally : while throwing Covered/or , 1973 , she deliberately pushed the clay off-center . The shallow bottom of this flask descends from a straight column ofa neck to bell like a dervish 's spinning skirt . It 's a fluid , organic form that foretold the direction Massaro 's work would take . " At this juncture , l was dissatisfied with throwing and pulling . I wanted to change the architecture of the pot . " The possibilities of architecture , specifically the ruins of brick buildings , had intrigued her duringa year in Italy in 1975 . But casting bricks was too obvious , so instead she slip cast thousands of bars of soap , stacking the pastel rectangles into walls and pyramids . These arrangements comment on that most utilitarian clay , brick , but also work as formal sculpture . Only the shape , balance and weight of the soap bars hold the stacks in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars are not fastened to the pedestal and thus a subtle aura of danger surrounds them . One careless jostle and this careful art would be just another ruin . Massaro 's fascination with everyday objects continued during a residency the following year at Kohler Co. , Sheboygan , Wisconsin , in the Arts/Industry program . There , she cast vintage Sunbeam irons , covering them in pearly glazes . " An iron is a wonderful design , she says . " I started with the idea of narrative , but because of the way they 're colored and glazed , the body of the piece is pure form . " After moving to California in i98o and adopting two children , Massaro 's fractured schedule necessitated work that was small , contained and easy to put aside and take up again . The answer was to return to making vessels . Although she has never been a production potter ( " I 'm much too contemplative , " she says ) , her series of cups and bowls that evolved duringthe i98os and gos proved to be quite salable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white porcelain vessels as if theywere blank canvases , she applies graphite pencil , china paint , wax resist , glossy and matte glazes and metallic lusters to create surfaces of subtle washes , punctuated with gemlike symbols and markings . " 1 might start decorating a piece by making a mark with a needle tool . That gives me a composition . I make another mark , and it becomes a conversation . In that part of the process , I have to do some planning and think ahead to the effect I want , but much of it is intuitive . " Some of the incised lines will fill with underglaze which may later be partially scraped away . Other lines will be emphasized with graphite pencil or may become receptacles for bright bits of colored overglaze . A single line of black underglaze pencil will , when fired at high temperature , separate into two lines of component substances , blue and brown , iron and manganese . " I 'm trying to arrive at a painting that captures a quality natural to ceramics , " Massaro says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chance of fire and my slipping in parts of myself . When you 're working with chance , you have to know the result could go either way . I know that if I put dry glaze in here " - she indicates a dripped area over an incised line- " this part will " wiggle . " If I want a white that looks pristine , I keep the glaze thin . fm working with what I know and orchestrating possibility . " Massaro 's engagement with pattern and function is especially interesting in Fruit Server ; 1989 . Here , she slip cast a grouping of cut pears , the splayed halves offering a flat surface to hold fresh fruit . To provide contrast with the colors of real fruit , she painted her ceramic pears in patterns of stark black and white . She intended to produce multiples for sale , but the servers proved too labor-intensive to be lucrative . Still , she had stumbled on a promising direction for sculpture . In subsequent works , Massaro uses underglazing and underpainting to build texture beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies with a fine bamboo brush . The fruits take on an otherworldly character in their jackets of fur or pinstripes or molecular patterns . " fm not trying to show virtuosity or patience or long hours suffering , " Massaro says of her technique . " I want the mark of the brush , the inexact circle , the color to come from behind . On some of the fruits , things are getting more hermetic and tight , so I want to loosen up , add more falls of color , more space . " Today the fruits are more abstract , organic shapes-halfspheres , wedges , sliced columns-that essentially are symbols of fruit . As Massaro 's work evolves , it murmurs of other ways to perceive the world . The abstraction of a thing lets us appreciate its reality ; the challenge of clay lets us accept that all artists grapple with the same concerns . " I really have n't gone past an exploration of volume , line , form and color , " Karen Massaro says . " It 's always an unfinished business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes frequently on the arts .
