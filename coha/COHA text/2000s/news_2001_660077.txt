<p> Ankana Dagga is an Indian ninth-grader who shares many of the same tastes , interests , and habits as bright kids anywhere in the " globalized " world . She teaches roller skating , studies classical Indian dance , reads John Grisham , swaps Celine Dion CDs , and has a crush on Brad Pitt . She also scores above 90 percent on crucial tests at Delhi Public School , one of the most competitive in India . Since third grade , she has subscribed to The Times of India . She studies three languages , including Latin - other subjects include physics , chemistry , and higher math . For years , India was seen as not quite East , not quite West , not a Soviet satellite , not an American ally . But today the world 's second-most-populous country is opening , developing nuclear weapons - and demanding recognition as " a great power . " Yet one test of " greatness , " as Mohandas Gandhi pointed out , is how a nation educates its next generation . Here that test extends especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sons . Changing attitudes and access to learning are felt most acutely by girls ; today they are the top scorers in schools all over India . And their hopes , ambitions , and prospects for success embody the aspirations of this Asian giant . Ankana herself hardly thinks in such grandiose terms . She would rather discuss involved theories about popular culture - why " Titanic " is overrated , why the Backstreet Boys and Hindi films are " so fake . " In keeping with the northern Indian Punjabi culture of living life to the fullest , Ankana moves effortlessly from parties to homework to after-school science projects - despite an intense competition that by now for her is routine . Her grandmother was an illiterate girl from the traditional princely desert kingdom of Rajasthan . But Ankana is part of the growing upper- middle class of English-speaking urban India , the India most often projected to the West . For her , the sky is the limit . Moreover , in Ankana 's generation and economic class , Indian women make choices they 've never had before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad ( most want to ) , a career . They do n't think of being " allowed " these choices . They just make them . In fact , if you are an American earning more than $ 50,000 a year , Ankana may more likely be a neighbor of yours one day than a less accomplished US girl across town . " These girls are more confident , much more clear than we were 20 years ago , " says Neerja Jawa , Ankana 's physics teacher . " They are very different . They 've grown up thinking of many possibilities . We used to believe things unquestioningly , blindly . They do n't . The reason is TV and media . " Still , nothing in emerging India is so simple . India 's female literacy rates are improving somewhat , and stubborn patriarchal traits are being challenged . But to understand Ankana 's place in India , it 's worth examining the cultural context : Educationally , socially , and financially Ankana is in an elite strata of Indian society . Only between 0.5 and 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 12th grade and go to college . Ankana is likely one of them . She sits at the top of a national school system that is highly selective and not very forgiving . US schools , by comparison , are relatively generous ; they leave room for experimentation and failure and stress remedial education . Most offer large doses of liberal arts and humanities ; and there are some 3,500 institutions of higher learning in the United States to choose from . In India , however , students who lose a year , or fall behind even a semester , may not be able to make up the work , or they may be forced to abandon career plans that require a college degree . A selection machine India today has 214 universities , up from 30 in 1950 . But only about 5 percent of all 12th-grade graduates will find a seat in those colleges . " India 's education system is a selection machine , " says Krishna Kumar , a leading educator at Delhi University . " In a chaotic country , this system supports a coherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make it . It 's just like that . " The biggest moment of selection in any Indian student 's life is the 10th-grade test . The all-India government exams are a hurdle every student must surmount . Not scoring well shuts many potential doors - not just key 11th- and 12th-grade math classes , but perhaps study abroad , certain jobs , and even certain lives . All students and parents know the importance of the exam . They dread it and prepare for it . When a student is at about the eighth grade , parents from south Tamil Nadu to upper Punjab start turning off the TV and closely monitoring their offspring 's study habits . " The board exam makes you , " says Vyoma Jha , one of Ankana 's five best friends in ninth grade at Delhi Public School . " The cutoff is 87 percent , and we are all aware of that . I 'm going to study hard . But I 'm not going to stress . If you study too hard , everything gets jumbled in your head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . She is talented , and her background - her school , neighborhood , and family - are powerful supports . It helps , for example , to have a genial physician for a father , a patient mother who runs a skating rink - and to live in Vasant Kunj . Vasant Kunj is not a wealthy suburb like the Scarsdale-style , farm-house communities outside Delhi . But its comfortable apartments reflect an upper- middle class mindset and pocketbook . Most adults have cars . There is tennis for kids , and a new culture of private gyms . Doctors , architects , civil engineers , and professors casually talk about relatives who live in the US and Great Britain , and most people have at least one relative in that category . Families hold birthday parties for kids at nice Delhi clubs . Residents know the connections , the sacrifice , and the right schools that it takes to succeed . By the standards of what is sometimes called the " liberal West , " the Dagga family would certainly be considered " enlightened . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talk at night , usually about everything , " as Santosh Dagga , Ankana 's mother , puts it . Both parents hail from Rajasthan , where village girls are married by age 15 . But the cosmopolitan Daggas retain few patriarchal views . Neither parent is bothered if their daughter , " marries early or late , " says Mridul Dagga , aka " Dad . " " We will let her choose . We just want her to be happy . " Ankana , who speaks rapid-fire English with precision and confidence , says , " OK , we talk about our crushes with friends , but marriage is something beyond my conception right now . " Dating on the sly Dating in India is still fairly frowned upon , even in cities . But it is on the rise . At DPS , dating is done on the sly , Ankana says . Students bring casual clothes to school , then " bunk " the day - stay out , and come back to school and change back into uniform . Mainly , they do so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing shabby clothes ; you have to have Nike shoes . You have to be seen as slightly rebellious . For example , carrying water bottles Indian parents send kids to school with water is considered highly stupid . " Being popular means using abusive language , being on the negative side of the teacher , and having boys after you . We all have crushes . I like David Duchovny and Brad Pitt , and I still like Indian film star Sharruk Khan , even though he 's not good looking from any angle . " But the qualities of cool are n't going to help anyone in navigating the academic rigors of a school like DPS ( see story above ) . What DPS most excels in is test preparation , all leading up to the 10th-grade exam . The school gives three major exams a year that require two weeks of study so concentrated that some students plan their weeks to the hour . When Ankana returned from summer vacation , for example , her first activity was an algebra quiz . No problem . She had spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semester . If tests are a mainstay at DPS , computer science is a speciality . By Grade 2 , every child is familiar with the keyboard and screen , and can run Windows software . They take computer science class at Grade 5 . They are expected to master HTML by Grade 7 , programming in Grade 8 , and advanced databases by Grade 9 . DPS is a prime feeder school for the newly famous Indian institutions called IITs , or Indian Information Tech . IITs have captured the imagination of the Indian public - since their graduates often have the pick of American high-tech companies , or local corporations here . A high ranking Indian government education official says that Indian kids today can all " go to an IIT and work abroad , or at corporations that have fountains out front , green lawns , and Western salaries . " The reality is less rosy . To apply to an IIT requires a special , more rigorous computer-study track for students in 10th through 12th grade . Each year , some 400,000 students apply to IITs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Students who forget this competitive world have only to look at the large mural on the wall in the main foyer outside Ms. Chona 's office : A copy of what looks like a 19th-century Delacroix , of a tiger who has leaped ravenously on top of a horse . Ankana 's circle of class friends - known as " the group " by her teacher - are above-90-percent scorers . They are as " globalized " as she , and do n't conceive their world as Darwinian . They go to films together , hold mock fashion shows , tell ghost stories . The ' X-Files ' generation They have a highly calibrated , highly refined system of deciding what is acceptable and what is not . Anything hyped is out . Ankana shivers in disgust when something comes up - like Hindi films or music - that she does n't like . TV shows like " The X-Files , " and " Friends " are in . So too , for some reason , is WWF wrestling , which Ankana says everyone knows is n't real , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it . My parents hate it . " Watching cricket was a major pastime , but not after the team scandals of the past year . Music is the biggest single topic , though it must be Western music . Her group has changed slightly over the years : " Some people have been excluded for being rude or mean or egotistic , which only means we talk to them less , " Ankana says . Ankana and her friends all share a desire to go abroad . Not only is foreign study a status symbol , it is an aspiration that takes on almost an ontological thirst . From an early age , the girls are exposed to the idea of living abroad . Parents raise the subject regularly , urging the girls to prepare themselves . At Ankana 's house , the preparations are well under way .
