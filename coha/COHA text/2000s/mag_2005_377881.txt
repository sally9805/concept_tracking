My grandparents , whom I lived with for three years as a child , were the greatest influence on my life . My grandfather Shia Seicol had come to the U.S. from Russia . He had a great passion for America and an amazing love of country . In New Haven , Conn. , where they lived , we were always going to parades . My grandfather and I would stand on the curb , and he 'd be holding my hand ; I could feel his hand breaking my fingers when the flag was coming by , and the martial music was playing . I 'd look up into his face and see a tear . <P> In between parades he was an inveterate letter writer to the President . Every letter started off , " My dearest , darling Mr. President : Here 's what I think you should do about this or that ... " Even when he disagreed with the President , the letter still started , " My dearest , darling Mr. President : Did n't I tell you last week that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and my grandmother lived in a fourth-floor walk-up  --  I suppose you could call it a tenement building . I would run down the three flights of stairs to get the mail out of our little brass mailbox . Every now and again there would be this small white envelope with the words THE WHITE HOUSE on it , and my 9-year-old heart fluttered . It would be a formal reply , and they came in those wonderful envelopes . <P> When I asked him why he wrote the President , he said it was because everything the President was responsible for was important for those he loved . <P> I thought of him when , years later , people started telling me how All in the Family had changed our culture . I did n't know what people were talking about . I thought if a couple thousand years of the Judeo-Christian ethic had n't corrected racism and lack of equal opportunity and so forth , my little half-hour situation comedy was n't going to do it either . Then I remembered my grandfather , standing at a lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dropping stones in the water , and my grandfather told me that each time I did it , I raised the level of the water . He said if a scientist were there , he could prove to me that each stone raised the level of the water . All you can see is the ripple , he said , but the ripple tells you that you did something . <P> How my grandfather would have loved being with me when I first saw the copy of the Declaration of Independence that my wife Lyn and I subsequently bought . It was spring 2001 , and I had read that the document was going to be auctioned off by Sotheby 's on the Internet . One of our little girls went to school with a little girl whose dad ran Sotheby 's in Los Angeles . He told me that the document , which happened to be sitting in his office , was one of 25 that existed in the world at the time . It was one of those that had been printed the night of July 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on horseback and sent around the 13 colonies . One of those that were read aloud in the town squares . <P> I went to see it at his office , and I was surprised at my own reaction . I looked at it , and I cried  --  like my grandfather had cried with the flag  --  and I knew in an instant that I would wish to buy it . I knew in that same instant that I would never just hang it on the wall in my home and that , if I could get it , I would find a way for it to travel .
