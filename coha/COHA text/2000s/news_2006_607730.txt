<p> For two decades , the money machine has churned , spitting out billions for the men and women who own the NFL 's 32 teams . Professional football did n't simply blossom in Paul Tagliabue 's reign as commissioner , it became a multimedia behemoth , lavished with the richest television deals in sports , unblemished by labor strife and blessed with lucrative sponsorships . <p> And the man partly responsible for much of this wealth is Roger Goodell , the son of a former senator from New York , who has run the league by Tagliabue 's side in relative anonymity . <p> " His fingerprints are all over every transaction the league has entered into the last 10 years , " said Dean Bonham , the president of the Colorado-based Bonham Group , which has negotiated for and against the NFL in marketing deals . <p> Said Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen , " On all the major decisions , whatever they were , Roger has been on the leading edge of those issues . " <p> Apparently satisfied with the opulence of their league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the third man to hold the job in the last 45 years . <p> Then again , it would have been hard for them to say no . Over the last two decades , the 47-year-old maneuvered his way through countless negotiations with television networks , foreign countries , gigantic corporations , hostile municipalities and union executives to push the NFL to its position as easily the most successful sports league in the country . <p> " We 're continuing something that has gone very well , " New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said after the announcement . " Roger said he got his MBA from Pete Rozelle and Paul Tagliabue . That 's pretty good . " <p> Goodell 's star rose in the mid-1990s . He was still in his early 30s when he was placed in charge of the league 's marketing arms  --  NFL Properties and NFL Trust . He was a key negotiator in generally peaceful bargaining sessions with the NFL Players Association , ran the expansion process in the 1990s that created millions of dollars for each existing team and secured the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The NFL is not as successful as it is now without Roger Goodell , " said John Wildhack , ESPN 's senior vice president for programming whose network will carry the league 's showcase event , " Monday Night Football , " starting this fall . <p> Success has eluded him only a few times . Goodell 's most public role over the past decade has been as the league 's point man in talks on returning the NFL to the Los Angeles area . But the nation 's second-largest media market remains without a team despite talks with various Southern California cities . Goodell also has been largely responsible for establishing the NFL overseas , but the league has been unable to match the global penetration of some other sports , most notably the NBA in China . <p> Goodell 's biggest triumph might be the work he did to nurture negotiations in 1998 that culminated in the league 's astounding eight-year , $17.5 billion deal with ABC , ESPN , Fox and CBS . Two years ago , he was also heavily involved in the negotiations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . <p> Many in the NFL believe Goodell proved himself so well in these talks that Tagliabue began grooming him several years ago as his replacement . Bowlen said he could tell in recent seasons that Goodell came to want to become commissioner . <p> " It 's unbelievable to me , " Goodell said yesterday . " It 's a life dream . To be able to follow your passion and end up as commissioner of the NFL is unbelievable . " <p> In many ways , he had been preparing for this role since he came to the league as a public relations intern in 1982 , a year after his graduation , magna cum laude in economics , from Washington &; Jefferson . Goodell has told co-workers he remembers sleeping with his football as a child and he was a good enough high school player to draw interest from some small colleges . But his playing days were ended by a knee injury at Washington &; Jefferson and he decided instead to direct his passion toward the business side of the sport . <p> A year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New York Jets , who had two resignations in their public relations office just before the start of the season and needed help . <p> " Right away , you knew Roger was one of the people that the more you gave him to do , the more he got done , " said Frank Ramos , the Jets ' public relations director at the time . " There was never any job beneath him . Every day he got along very well with people . He came up with some ideas that would make things better for us with the media . " <p> Goodell was born and raised in Jamestown , N.Y. , one of five sons of Charles E. Goodell , who was a Republican congressman for most of the 1960s , spending his teenage years in Washington and later Bronxville , N.Y . The elder Goodell was understated . His car was a beat-up , yellow Volkswagen bug . In Congress , he teamed with a young Donald Rumsfeld , Robert Griffin , Albert Quie and Robert Ellsworth to turn a Michigan representative named Gerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 , Gov . Nelson Rockefeller of New York appointed Goodell to the Senate after Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated . The choice backfired on Rockefeller when Goodell went to Cornell University to meet with a group of African-American students who were holding a sit-in . The students blistered the senator with pointed questions about the Vietnam War in an exchange that shocked Goodell so much that upon returning to Washington , he introduced legislation that would stop funds for the war . <p> To Rockefeller and the White House of Richard M. Nixon , this move was seen as almost mutinous , so much so that Goodell had to work proactively to stave off a Rockefeller motion to have him removed from the Senate at the state 's Republican convention . Ultimately , his war stand cost him and two years after being named to the seat , he was defeated in the 1970 election by James Buckley , who ran as a member of the Conservative Party . <p> He became known as one of the first voices of Republican dissent to the war . But Charles E. Goodell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued by the Brooklyn Dodgers . During his Senate days , he was the Republicans ' catcher in the annual congressional baseball games played at RFK Stadium . <p> " I just loved him , " said George Mitrovich , who was on Goodell 's staff and keeps a picture of Charles Goodell on the wall of his home in San Diego . " He was a kind , tolerant person . " <p> When Ford became president in 1974 , he named Goodell chairman of the clemency board to consider the cases of those charged with evading service in the Vietnam war . <p> Asked what Roger Goodell might have taken from his father , Mitrovich , who still speaks to all of Charles Goodell 's sons , said the senator was a funny man whose meetings often broke up with an exchange of jokes that had him laughing so hard his whole body convulsed . <p> " I see Roger having the same sense of humor and a similar sense of the absurd , " Mitrovich said . " In Roger , I see Charlie 's intelligence . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Charlie Goodell ever thought of him as anything other than an extremely kind person . There is a certain vibrancy to Roger 's personality that his father had . " <p> It was n't surprising then that one of the first things Roger Goodell did as commissioner was joke about getting the news from Rooney . <p> " Dan Rooney came upstairs to my room to tell me , " Goodell said . " I was not watching the NFL Network . I was doing some work , trying to be distracted . Fortunately I 'd just put my pants on . " <p> Mitrovich worked on the effort to bring two Super Bowls to San Diego and thus has seen Tagliabue operate . He found the outgoing commissioner to be lifeless and arrogant and was offended when Tagliabue drolly declared the city 's Qualcomm Stadium unfit for any further Super Bowls . <p> As for the difference between Tagliabue and Roger Goodell ? <p> " Roger actually has a personality ! " he exclaimed . <p> This comes up a lot in conversations about the younger Goodell . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aloof Tagliabue , who allowed his droll sense of humor to show publicly only in the final months of his 17-year tenure . <p> " I think it might be that Paul came from a legal background " as the league 's outside counsel before becoming commissioner , Ramos said . " There are a lot of people that when they talk to the media , lawyers advise them what to say . I think that affects the approach Paul takes . I suspect Roger has learned something from his father who was in politics . " <p> Where Tagliabue often kept a distance from owners after hours at league meetings , Goodell worked the hotel bar , shaking hands and answering questions . When golf outings were arranged , Goodell often went , not Tagliabue . When owners had something they wanted to discuss with Tagliabue , they often called Goodell , though some , like Bowlen , considered this more of an accessibility issue than one of detachment . As commissioner , Tagliabue was pulled in too many directions , the Broncos owner figures , leaving less time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they may have talked to Goodell three times a week , while they spoke to Tagliabue maybe two times a month . <p> If nothing else , this closeness has given him a connection to the owners that probably no one else in the league has ever had . Bowlen said he always felt whatever his opinion was on an issue that Goodell would convey it to Tagliabue . During the last bargaining session with the Players Association , union head Gene Upshaw used Goodell to relay messages to the commissioner by e-mailing or text messaging Goodell on his BlackBerry . <p> Those who have done business with him say Goodell is pleasant and honest but also a firm negotiator . They notice , however , that he listens intently to proposals , rarely rejecting something out of hand . John Wildhack remembers suggesting the idea of a Thursday night season-opening game during a dinner in 2000 . Rather than brush the idea off as Wildhack worried he might , Goodell pondered the concept  --  which would have been a dramatic change for the NFL . Two years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ever since . <p> Then again , like so many others who have come to do business with the NFL over the years , Wildhack had a close bond with Goodell . For back in 1989 , it was Goodell  --  then a young marketing executive with the league  --  who had to lead Wildhack and ESPN through the logistical disaster of televising the league 's first exhibition game in Tokyo . <p> " He was tremendous to work with , " Wildhack said . <p> At times , Goodell might have been too good at making the league money . In the book , " America 's Game : The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation " by Michel MacCambridge , an anonymous owner complained that Goodell was too obsessed with profits , grumbling that the new commissioner " uses words like ' monetize ' and ' commoditize . ' " <p> But despite all the success Tagliabue and Goodell had together , there are more serious challenges looming . A common thought around the league is that Tagliabue got out at just the right time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the issues that will confront Goodell . <p> Global expansion would seem to be the most difficult one . At some point , analysts say , if the NFL is going to continue to make money at the rate it has done so far , it will have to make a breakthrough in other countries . As the NBA continues to increase its foothold in China 's booming economy in preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympics , the NFL 's boldest overseas move , NFL Europe , remains a six-team league , and only one franchise plays outside Germany after Barcelona and Glasgow were moved at least partly because of poor attendance . <p> But while top European soccer franchises such as Manchester United and Barcelona have found new , very lucrative revenue streams and created new fan bases by selling merchandise , television packages and other items outside their countries , NFL teams have not had comparable success , largely because the game is n't played in nearly as many countries . <p> The league must also figure out how much it wants to be in the television business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that the NFL can make more money by producing its own broadcasts  --  both at the league and team level . But the league 's NFL Network is only a few years old and will make its first forays into carrying its own game telecasts this year , so there is no barometer to say how successful it can be with television . <p> Still , nothing is murkier than the NFL 's labor future . Tagliabue 's last significant act  --  the labor agreement reached in the spring  --  might have been his biggest . Unlike the previous labor negotiations , he had to stem an uprising from several owners of small-market teams who felt themselves being priced out by wealthier clubs such as the Washington Redskins . It might have been the NFL 's most delicate negotiation in nearly two decades , but Tagliabue brought the owners together until all but two voted for the deal . <p> In six years , the contract will expire and pulling everyone together again might be almost impossible . And if football is suddenly faced with the labor problems that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might grind to a halt . <p> " It 's nothing short of extraordinary to get the owners to come together on a 30 to 2 vote , " Bonham said . " It 's very difficult to point to Roger Goodell and say , ' You did n't do it , Paul did it . ' It 's always the guy with the name on the door that has to negotiate . Will he be able to wield the same diplomacy and clout that Paul Tagliabue had ? My guess is he will , but you never know . " <p> The owners are betting their wealth that he will . <p> Staff writer Mark Maske reported from Northbrook , Ill.
