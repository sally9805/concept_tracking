Section : WHO 'S NEXT 2005 BARACK OBAMA : The Dems ' freshest face has a new challenge : to help his party relocate its moral core . Meet him  --  and nine others who will shape our world . <p> That first weekend after the election , Barack Obama and his wife , Michelle , decided to go see " Ray " at the movie theater in their Hyde Park neighborhood on Chicago 's South Side . As they settled into their seats , a friend called out , " Barack ! " and the audience turned around and began clapping . A few days later , when the Obamas went to another movie , this time with their daughters Malia , 6 , and Sasha , 3 , it happened again  --  sustained applause for the new junior senator from Illinois . <p> Anyone who has ever seen a senator in public knows that this kind of thing just does n't happen outside of staged campaign events . In fact , when they show up at ball games , politicians are often booed . Obama  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and first African-American male Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate  --  is unlikely to stay so popular , but he 's already in a different category of fame . <p> A Tiger Woods category . A David Letterman and " Will &; Grace " category ( Grace said in a fall episode that she dreamed she was in the shower with Obama , who was " Ba-racking my world ! " ) . A Robert F. Kennedy or Hillary Clinton comes-to-the-Senate category , where the national publicity upon their election exceeds that received by most senators in their entire careers . " I 'm so overexposed I make Paris Hilton look like a recluse , " Obama joked at Washington 's Gridiron Club dinner in early December . " I figure there 's nowhere to go from here but down , so tonight I 'm announcing my retirement from the United States Senate . " <p> Of course there 's another direction to go than down , and desperate Democrats  --  viewing Obama 's electrifying speech at the Democratic convention and landslide victory as about the only good news in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ticket in 2008 . Although he will inevitably make most shortlists for vice president ( and at 43 , he 's the same age JFK was when he was elected president ) , this speculation is almost comically premature for an incoming senator . But it does allow Obama to use what his Harvard Law School classmate Ken Mehlman , soon to be chairman of the Republican Party , calls his " star power " to work with the GOP on bridging Red-Blue divisions and getting some things done . The son of a black economist from Kenya and a white teacher from Kansas might be uniquely qualified to nudge the country toward the color purple . <p> " One party seems to be defending a moribund status quo , and the other is defending an oligarchy , " he says coolly . " It 's not a very attractive choice . " Obama 's a Blue State Democrat , all right , and by most standards a liberal one . But Illinois Rep. Rahm Emanuel , an architect of President Clinton 's " Third Way " approach , sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spectrum : " Not just a phenomenal writer  --  he wrote that convention speech himself  --  but incredibly pragmatic . " <p> Some party constituencies might be in for a surprise . Obama may be the only African-American in the Senate , but this is not a man who wants to be seen as the leader of black America . When he spoke at a Congressional Black Caucus reception recently , Obama graciously thanked several caucus leaders by name , then concluded with a short but telling statement : " I 'm looking forward to working with you on behalf of all Americans . " <p> But first he wants everyone to know that he 'll be 99th in Senate seniority and " sharpening pencils " for a while . " I 'm feeling very much like the rookie and looking for guidance from those who 've been there for 15 or 20 years , " Obama says with a ritualistic modesty he knows is expected of him now . He makes a point of saying that he 'll be " listening and learning " from people like Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things done in the minority . <p> To make sure he 's concentrating on serving Illinois , he 's turned down more than 200 speaking offers from around the world . Michelle does n't mince words about the need for supporters to tamp down their inflated expectations of her husband , from unemployed workers in downstate Illinois looking for decent jobs to villagers in Kenya who think he 'll bring them new schools . " Shoot , let people get disappointed right now , " she says with a philosophical chuckle that owes more to her well-grounded upbringing on the South Side than her own years at Harvard Law . " They have to stop and think what 's realistic . " <p> Yet for a guy who a year ago was running fourth in some polls in the Democratic primary , " realistic " is a relative concept . Obama is n't cocky but he is confident , and fully prepared to step into a leadership role for the Democrats . Incoming Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , who calls Obama " a gentleman and a scholar , " expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations Committee and fit in well in the clubby Senate , where Obama has hired defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle 's chief of staff to run his office . <p> That 's the inside game . But Reid 's wife noticed something on election night that helped the minority leader think about this new young senator in a broader way . After thanking his family in his victory speech , Obama next mentioned his pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , of the Trinity United Church of Christ on the South Side , the African-American minister and community leader who first introduced Obama to " the audacity of hope . " " That said it all , " Reid concludes . " People do n't know where he stands on issues , but they know he 's an honest , God-fearing man . " <p> It was n't always so in the Obama family , as chronicled in his lyrical ( if , by his own admission , overly long ) 1995 memoir , " Dreams From My Father , " now reissued and a best seller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised wearing nothing but a goatskin loincloth , worked as a servant for British colonialists in Nairobi and converted to Islam before returning to farm on the shores of Lake Victoria . But the new senator 's father , Barack Sr. ( the name means " blessing from God " ) , had no discernible religious convictions . After growing up herding goats , he became the first African student at the University of Hawaii , where in 1959 he met an 18-year-old white girl from the mainland , descended from Cherokees , Baptists , Methodists , Kansas abolitionists and , indirectly , Jefferson Davis , president of the Confederacy . <p> Over the objections of their families ( the white side was more accepting ) , they married , but when Obama was 2 , his father left Hawaii , first for Harvard , then back to Kenya , where he worked for the government and was later killed in a car accident . He returned to Hawaii to see his son only once , when Barack was 10 . <p> Barack , often called " Barry " inside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother saw religion as an impediment to broader values , like tolerance and racial inclusivity . She remembered churchgoing folks in Kansas and Texas who also called people niggers . But she was a deeply spiritual person , and when I moved to Chicago after graduating from Columbia and worked with church-based community organizations , I kept hearing her values expressed in the church . " That tapped into " the hurt and pain " he felt as a fatherless biracial child and spoke to his sense of " the fragility and power and mystery of life . " <p> The Democrats , Obama believes , need to speak to that power and mystery , too . He stops short of calling for a " religious left " to counter the political power of the religious right , but he wants the party to reconnect to what he sees as its roots in a moral imperative : " This should n't be hard to do . Martin Luther King did it . The abolitionists did it . Dorothy Day of the Catholic Workers did it . Most of the reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious models . We do n't have to start from scratch . " <p> But Obama does call for a " new narrative " that simultaneously offers fresh solutions for problems like outsourcing ( he hastens to add that he does n't have them yet ) and restores " timeless values . " Unlike many liberals , he readily admits that a faction of the Democratic Party during the 1960s twisted the American tradition of individualism into " licentiousness " and rejected the party 's older values of family , community and faith . Ever since , he says , the Republicans have caricatured the Democrats for ignoring these values , a line of assault that has proved especially effective because communal and moral values were exactly what gave the Democrats their advantage in the mid-20th century . <p> " They attacked our strengths , " Obama says . When Democrats lost these deeper moorings , their economic message rang hollow : " People figured , ' At least with Bush , I can go hunt with my friends and my wife can go to church ' , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dads , say , or women who enjoyed going to church with their grandmother or granddaughter , these cultural concerns become family issues that cut deep . <p> Obama does n't believe that John Kerry lost because of " moral values . " It 's much more complicated than that . But he knows that the cultural divide and issues like gay marriage and abortion played a role , and that Kerry actually lost among his fellow Roman Catholics . The task now , Obama says , is not to back off on any particular issue but to at least open these cultural subjects for discussion again  --  and for Democrats to " reclaim and reassert in very explicit language that our best ideas rise out of communal values . " <p> Obama began that process in his now famous keynote speech at the convention ( " We worship an awesome God in the Blue States , and we do n't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States " ) , which showed that an upbeat " One America " message still resonates . Running in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily white areas . The experience of being cheered in Cairo , Ill. , once among the most racist towns in America , was a breakthrough moment . This is not about " diversity " ( a word he recognizes as horribly overused ) but about embracing our hybrid origins and transcending our often narrow-minded past . <p> Even so , Obama 's own rethinking of where the country should go still contains more questions than answers . How to respect entrepreneurship without allowing corporations to run roughshod ? How to balance jobs at home with the benefits of globalization ? In a new preface to his memoir , he 's better able to describe what he 's against than what he 's for : " The hardening of lines , the embrace of fundamentalism and tribe , doom us all . " Softening those lines wo n't be easy in today 's fractious media culture , even with a unifying spiritual appeal . <p> And Obama remains concerned about how some Democrats may go about finding religion . " It 's dangerous to try to engineer this in some synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it comes off as phony . People can sniff it out , " he cautions . " Democrats have to say to themselves , ' What are the values we care most deeply about ? ' then do the hard spiritual work ahead of time . You ca n't every once in a while just throw in the word ' God ' . " <p> It 's that idea of hard internal work  --  " soul-searching , no pun intended , " he says  --  that seems to animate Obama . Even his most external qualities  --  his campaign-trail sociability and affable dealmaking  --  seem more the learned skills of a methodical thinker than the natural instincts of a backslapper . " He does n't want to be this messianic figure carrying stone tablets , " says David Axelrod , his campaign manager . " He understands he has to do the work . " <p> Except for a couple of embittered slacker years at a Honolulu private school , this fits with his whole life story . Becoming the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of affirmative action or popularity but of academic candlepower and unrelenting work . Hill Harper , an actor now starring in " CSI : New York , " was a law-school classmate of Obama 's who remembers his competitiveness on the basketball court and humility off it . He did n't carry himself like the big man on campus that he clearly was , though he remained confident enough to accept an offer to write a memoir when he was n't yet 30 . For everyone else , the point of getting on the law review was to build their resumes . Not Obama . " He could have easily gotten a Supreme Court clerkship and six-figure salary from any law firm , " Harper says . " But he was committed to doing the work he wanted to do "  --  back in Chicago , back in the community . <p> Michelle , who met Barack in Chicago after law school , goes so far as to say that her husband " is not a politician first and foremost . He 's a community activist exploring the viability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize that there 's nothing inevitable about Obama 's running for president or even staying in the Senate if he does n't feel he 's making a difference . <p> Although he 's emerging suddenly on the national stage , Obama has actually devoted himself to social change for nearly 20 years , first as a community organizer in housing projects , then as a civil-rights lawyer , constitutional-law professor and director of a huge voter-registration drive . There have been setbacks . In 2000 , four years after being elected to the Illinois state Senate , he challenged incumbent Rep. Bobby Rush , a former Black Panther , for the House . This was a mistake , and Obama 's support from white contributors outside the district did n't help . He lost with 30 percent of the vote . <p> But when Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr . decided not to run for the U.S. Senate , Jackson became one of Obama 's earliest supporters . ( Jackson 's sister Santita was a bridesmaid for Michelle . ) After some early concern that he was aloof and " too white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have faded . It was no surprise that Alan Keyes , the black right-winger imported from Maryland to run against him in the general election , went nowhere . " Some people still say , ' The brother ai n't gon na hang , he ai n't gon na hold ' , " says Rep. Danny Davis . " But he has continued to express the needs of disadvantaged people . " <p> Obama is realistic about the challenges of being in the minority party in Washington , but he got a lot accomplished in Springfield , even though the GOP was in control of the state Senate for six of his eight years there . Figuring that the Republicans were bent on tax cuts , he made sure the working poor got a big tax credit , too , and reached across the aisle to push through the first campaign-finance reform in 25 years in Illinois . " It really required someone who could set aside partisan differences and look for consensus , " says Cindi Canary , director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform . <p> Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landmark bill that made Illinois the first state in the nation to require the videotaping of police interrogations . Emil Jones Jr. , the Democratic president of the Illinois state Senate ( and a man who confesses to crying during Obama 's convention speech ) , says it was Obama 's quiet legislative craftsmanship that broke the logjam with Republicans . The bill does more than eliminate the problem of coerced confessions . The admissibility of the videotapes in court helps " free the innocent but also convict the guilty , " Obama notes , an example of the " win-win " ideas he hopes to pursue on Capitol Hill . <p> During the primary , Obama 's expert grasp of foreign policy helped him bolt from the pack . He was an early opponent of the Iraq war , but made it clear he was against " this war , not all wars . " ( He supported the invasion of Afghanistan . ) He focused on the growing problems of veterans and will also serve on that committee in the Senate . On domestic issues , his voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably alienate some of the conservatives who told him over the summer how much they liked his speech . Certain alliances that were critical to his winning ( for instance , a timely teachers-union endorsement ) may make it harder for him to challenge Democratic Party orthodoxy . <p> The Obamas will be among the least wealthy families in the Senate . Barack says he must be one of the only members to prepare his own taxes ( an incentive , he says , to work on tax simplification ) . Michelle , who launched the Chicago office of Public Allies , an innovative nonprofit that provides leadership development , now works for the University of Chicago Hospital and wo n't relocate to Washington just yet . Amid important meetings after the election , the Obamas found themselves at the hospital at 5 a.m. when one of their daughters could n't stop vomiting . " They 're working hard to be both good parents and providers , " says Cindy Moelis , a family friend . " It puts them in touch with what most parents are going through . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giving a good speech does n't make you Superman "  --  and she 's willing to enumerate a few of Barack 's faults . He started smoking again under the stress of the campaign , and still leaves his dirty socks on the floor . But that 's about it . He 's got a smaller ego and a greater appreciation of family these days , she says . After his major opponents in both the primary and the general elections dropped out amid sex scandals ( though Obama would probably have won anyway ) , " people always ask , ' What 's he got in the closet ? ' Well , we 've been married 13 years , and I 'd be shocked if there was some deep , dark secret . " <p> His secret is of a different kind  --  not dark , not light , and maybe a tad intellectual for a country that does n't like its politicians too smart . But it will soon be even more audible , from the well of the Senate and beyond . Some day it might even " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : SKYWALKER : Obama readies himself for the Senate on a Chicago rooftop <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BRIGHT LIGHTS : Chatting with Kerry at the Democratic National Convention in July , where the young Illinois legislator delivered the keynote address <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BONING UP : Obama , huddling with consultants in Chicago , knows he needs to dial back expectations .
