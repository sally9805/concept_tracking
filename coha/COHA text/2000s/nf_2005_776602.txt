Six Weeks in Autumn // Assistant Attorney General Viet Dinh took his seat in La Colline restaurant on Capitol Hill and signaled for a cup of coffee . It was one of those standard Washington breakfasts , where politicos mix schmoozing and big ideas to start their days . // An intense foot soldier for Attorney General Ashcroft , Dinh had been in his job for only a few months . He wanted to make a good impression on others at the session and craved the caffeine to keep his edge . As he sipped his fourth cup and listened to the patter of White House and Hill staffers , a young man darted up to the table . " A plane has crashed , " he said . " It hit the World Trade Center . " // Dinh and the rest of the voluble group went silent . Then their beepers began chirping in unison . At another time , it might have seemed funny , a Type-A Washington moment . Now they looked at one another and rushed out of the restaurant . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried back to the Justice Department , where the building was being evacuated . Like countless other Americans , he was already consumed with a desire to strike back . Unlike most , however , he had an inkling of how : by doing whatever was necessary to strengthen the government 's legal hand against terrorists . // Jim Dempsey was sifting through emails at his office at the Center for Democracy and Technology on Farragut Square when his boss , Jerry Berman , rushed in . " Turn on the TV , " Berman said . Dempsey reached for the remote , and images came rushing at him . Crisp sunshine . Lower Manhattan glinting in the brilliance . A jetliner cutting through the scene . // Dempsey was a lanky and slow-speaking former Hill staffer who combined a meticulous attention to detail with an aw-shucks demeanor . Since the early 1990s , he has been one of the leading watchdogs of FBI surveillance initiatives , a reasoned and respected civil liberties advocate routinely summoned to the Hill by both political parties to advise lawmakers about technology and privacy issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Trade Center , he knew it was the work of terrorists , and the FBI was foremost in his mind . " They have screwed up so bad , " he said to himself . " With all the powers and resources that they have , they should have caught these guys . " // At the same moment , it dawned on him that his work  --  and the work of many civil liberties activists over the years to check the increasingly aggressive use of technology by law enforcement officials  --  was about to be undone . // The car arrived at Senator Patrick Leahy 's house in northern Virginia shortly after 9 am . The Vermont Democrat took his place in the front seat and , as the car coursed toward the Potomac , he read through some notes about the pending nomination of a new drug czar and thought about a meeting that morning at the Supreme Court . // Half-listening to the radio , Leahy heard something about an explosion and the World Trade Center . He asked the driver to turn it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what they were seeing on television . It sounded ominous . The car continued toward the Supreme Court and the conference he was to attend with Chief Justice William Rehnquist and circuit court judges from around the country . Leahy headed to the Court 's conference room , with its thickly carpeted floors and oak-paneled walls lined with portraits of the first eight chief justices . When Rehnquist arrived , Leahy leaned toward him and whispered , " Bill , before we start , I believe we have a terrorist attack . " // As if on cue , a muffled boom echoed through the room . Smoke began rising across the Potomac from the Pentagon . // Leahy chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee , putting him at the center of an inevitable debate about how to fight back . Leahy was one of Congress 's most liberal members , a longtime proponent of civil liberties who had always worked to keep the government from trampling individual rights . But Leahy was also a former prosecutor , a pragmatist who understood what investigators were up against in trying to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to press him for more police powers while civil libertarians would look to him as their standard-bearer . Leahy wanted to strike the right balance . But after watching an F-16 roar over the Mall that afternoon , he resolved to do whatever he could , as a patriot and a Democrat , to give law enforcement officials more tools to stop future attacks . // The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon did n't just set off a national wave of mourning and ire . They reignited and reshaped a smoldering debate over the proper use of government power to peer into the lives of ordinary people . // The argument boiled down to this : In an age of high-tech terror , what is the proper balance between national security and the privacy of millions of Americans , whose personal information is already more widely available than ever before ? Telephone records , emails , oceans of detail about individuals ' lives  --  the government wanted access to all of it to hunt down terrorists before they struck . // For six weeks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Washington leaders engaged in pitched , closed-door arguments over how much new power the government should have in the name of national security . They were grappling not only with the specter of more terrorist attacks but also with the chilling memories of Cold War Red-baiting , J. Edgar Hoover 's smear campaigns , and Watergate-era wiretaps. // At the core of the dispute was a body of little known laws and rules that , over the last half century , defined and limited the government 's ability to snoop : Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act governed electronic eavesdropping . The " pen register , trap and trace " rules covered the use of devices to track the origin and destination of telephone calls . The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA , regulated the power to spy domestically when seeking foreign intelligence information . // The White House , the Justice Department , and their allies in Congress now wanted to ease those restraints , and they wanted to do it as quickly as possible . Though put into place to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CIA , and others , the restrictions were partly to blame for the intelligence gaps on September 11 , the government said . Implicit in that wish list was the desire to tap into the data revolution . In the previous decade , the world had watched the power of computers increase at an extraordinary pace . At the same time , the price of data storage plummeted , while new software tools enabled analysts to tap into giant reservoirs of names , addresses , purchases , and other details , and make sense of it all . It was a kind of surveillance that did n't rely only on cameras and eavesdropping . This was the age of behavioral profiling and at the front were the marketers who wanted you to open your wallet . Now the government wanted their help . // The administration also wanted new authority to secretly detain individuals suspected of terrorism and to enlist banks and other financial services companies in the search for terrorist financing . Law enforcement sought broad access to business databases filled with information about the lives of ordinary citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among plotters . // Jim Dempsey and other civil libertarians agreed that the existing laws were outdated , but for precisely the opposite reason  --  because they already gave the government access to immense amounts of information unavailable a decade ago . Handing investigators even more power , they warned , would lead to privacy invasions and abuses . // They stared at a television in the bright sunroom of Dinh 's Chevy Chase home , a handful of policy specialists from the Justice Department who wondered what to do next . Only hours before , they had fled their offices , cringing as fighter jets patrolled Washington 's skies . Now , as news programs replayed the destruction , they talked about their friend Barbara Olson , conservative commentator and wife of Solicitor General Ted Olson . She was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 when it crashed into the Pentagon . // Dinh could n't believe Barbara was gone . He 'd just had dinner at the Olsons ' house two nights before , and she had been in rare form . Her humor was irrepressible . Dinh passed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the other dinner guests , Washington , D.C. : Then and Now . // It was hard to process so much death amid so much sunshine . Dinh and his colleagues tried to focus on the work ahead . They agreed they faced a monumental , even historic task : a long-overdue reworking of anti-terrorism laws to prevent something like this from happening again on American soil . Their marching orders came the next morning , as they reconvened in a conference room in Dinh 's suite of offices on the fourth floor of Justice . Ashcroft was n't there  --  he was in hiding along with other senior government officials . Just before the meeting , Dinh had spoken to Adam Ciongoli , Ashcroft 's counselor , who conveyed the attorney general 's desires . // " Beginning immediately , " Dinh told the half dozen policy advisers and lawyers , " we will work on a package of authorities "  --  sweeping , dramatic , and based on practical recommendations from FBI agents and Justice Department lawyers in the field . " The charge from Ashcroft was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for law enforcement , within the bounds of the Constitution , to discharge the obligation to fight this war against terror , ' " he said . // Dinh 's enthusiasm for the task was evident . At thirty-four , he seemed perpetually jazzed up , smiled often and spoke quickly , as though his words , inflected with the accent of his native Vietnam , could n't keep up with his ideas . A graduate of Harvard Law School , he had learned his way around Washington as an associate special counsel to the Senate Whitewater committee , and as a special counsel to Senator Pete Domenici ( R-N.M. ) during the Clinton impeachment trial . " What are the problems ? " Dinh asked the group around the table . // For the next several hours  --  indeed , over the next several days  --  Dinh 's colleagues catalogued gripes about the legal restraints on detective and intelligence work . Some of the complaints had been bouncing around the FBI and Justice Department for years . Because of the law 's peculiarities , it was unclear if investigators were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way they could phone calls . They could obtain search warrants more easily for a telephone tape machine than for commercial voice-mail services . And the amount of information that intelligence agents and criminal investigators were permitted to share was limited , making it much harder to target and jail terrorists . // All of this , the lawyers agreed , had to change . Now . // Jim Dempsey was swamped . Reporters , other activists , congressional staffers  --  everyone wanted his take on how far the Justice Department and Congress would go in reaction to the attacks . " We were getting fifty calls a day , " he recalled . Dempsey knew Congress would not have the will to resist granting dramatic new powers to law enforcement . It was a classic dynamic : Something terrible happens . Legislators rush to respond . They do n't have time to investigate the policy implications thoroughly , so they reach for what 's available and push it through . // That was a nightmare for Dempsey . Looking for signs of hope that the legislative process could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made his own calls around town . " A crisis mentality emerges , and there was clearly a crisis .... The push for action , the appearance of action , becomes so great . " // Within days of the attack , a handful of lawmakers took to the Senate floor with legislation that had been proposed and shot down in recent years because of civil liberties concerns . Many of the proposals had originally had nothing to do with terrorism . One bill , called the Combating Terrorism Act , proposed expanding the government 's authority to trace telephone calls to include email . It was a legacy of FBI efforts to expand surveillance powers during the Clinton administration , which had supported a variety of technology-oriented proposals opposed by civil libertarians . Now it was hauled out and approved in minutes . // One of the few voices advocating calm deliberation was Patrick Leahy . It was not clear what he would be able to do in such a highly charged atmosphere . // Across the city and across the country , other civil libertarians braced themselves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halperin , former head of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union and a former national security official in three administrations . Halperin , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , was personally familiar with government surveillance . // While working as a National Security Council staffer in the Nixon administration , Halperin was suspected of leaking information about the secret U.S. bombing of Cambodia . His house was wiretapped by the FBI , and the taps continued for months after he left the government . // Now , twenty-four hours after the attacks , he read an email from a member of an online group that had been formed to fight a Clinton administration plan to make publishing classified materials a crime . The writer warned the plan would be reprised . Halperin had been anticipating this moment for years . More than a decade ago , he wrote an essay predicting that terrorism would replace communism as the main justification for domestic surveillance . " I sat and stared at that email for a few minutes and decided that I could not do my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he would say later . // Halperin banged out a call to arms on his computer . " There can be no doubt that we will hear calls in the next few days for congress to enact sweeping legislation to deal with terrorism , " he wrote in the email to more than two dozen civil libertarians on September 12 . " This will include not only the secrecy provision , but also broad authority to conduct electronic and other surveillance and to investigate political groups .... We should not wait . " // Within hours , Jim Dempsey , Marc Rotenberg from the Electronic Privacy Information Center , and others had offered their support . Their plan : To build on Halperin 's call for legislative restraint while striking a sympathetic note about the victims of the attacks . They started putting together a meeting to sign off on a civil liberties manifesto : " In Defense of Freedom at a Time of Crisis . " // Underlying the discussion about how to respond to the terror attacks was the mid-1970s investigation , led by Senator Frank Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of domestic spying . Through hundreds of interviews and the examination of tens of thousands of documents , the Church Committee found that the FBI , the CIA , and other government agencies had engaged in pervasive surveillance of politicians , religious organizations , women 's rights advocates , anti-war groups , and civil liberties activists . // At FBI headquarters in Washington , agents had developed more than half a million domestic intelligence files during the Cold War . The CIA had secretly opened and often photographed almost a quarter-million letters in the United States from 1953 to 1973 . One of the most egregious intelligence abuses was an FBI counterintelligence program known as COINTELPRO . It was , the Church Report said , " designed to ' disrupt ' groups and ' neutralize ' individuals deemed to be threats to domestic security . " Among other things , COINTELPRO operations included undermining the jobs of political activists , sending anonymous letters to " spouses of intelligence targets for the purposes of destroying their marriages , " and a systematic campaign to undermine the Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his personal life . " Too many people have been spied upon by too many government agencies and too much information has been collected " through secret informants , wiretaps , bugs , surreptitious mail opening , and break-ins , the Church Report had warned . // Christopher Pyle , a professor at Mount Holyoke College , remembers those days well . In 1967 and 1968 , while serving in the Army , he taught law at the Army 's intelligence school at Fort Holabird , Maryland . One of his classes focused on CONUS intelligence and spot reports , the Army 's shorthand for intelligence in the continental United States . No one told him exactly what to teach , so he concentrated on what he thought the Army might need to quell riots , the use of maps , layouts of city parks for bivouacs , the configuration of bridges , so that Army trucks would not get stuck under them or fall through them on the way to a crisis . One day an officer directly involved in actual CONUS intelligence operations approached him . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? " // " No , " Pyle said . " What can you tell me ? " // Pyle and another instructor arranged for a briefing . They were taken to a huge building that once had been used to assemble railroad engines . It had a large black arch and , in one brightly lit room , an interior cage made of mesh wire . Pyle walked into the cage , where an officer showed him books containing mug shots . He looked in the first volume and saw a familiar face . It was Ralph David Abernathy , Martin Luther King 's assistant . Officers called the books the " black list . " As Pyle recalled it , they were actually labeled : persons active in civil disturbances . On a bench near the books was a stack of computer punch cards , the kind used in the 1960s to program the cutting-edge machines of the day . Written on the cards in pencil were the names of people whose information the cards contained . The top card was about Arlo Tatum , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Conscientious Objectors in Philadelphia , a group of activists who advised soldiers and others about their rights . Outside the cage , Pyle saw more than a dozen teletype machines . The head of the CONUS intelligence section told him they were spitting out reports from some fifteen hundred Army operatives about demonstrations with twenty people or more . Pyle was starting to understand how naive he 'd been . He began formulating a plan . He would be getting out of the Army soon . He could tell the world about what was going on . When he joined the Army he took an oath to defend the country against all enemies , here and abroad . In his mind now , that included the Army 's intelligence operation . They turned in their security badges and left the building . // " So I turned to the briefer and said , ' This is really terrific stuff . You are doing a great job . Do you have anything I can show my students ? ' " // The briefer gave him teletype printouts for the week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it told of undercover Army agents attending a meeting at a Unitarian church . Pyle thanked him and turned in his security badge for the building . " It was very clear to me that we had just witnessed the essential apparatus of a police state , " Pyle said . " It was n't that these people were trying to create a police state . They were very nice people . The kind that you would want as your friends and neighbors . But they were creating a reporting apparatus that was covering millions of Americans engaged in completely lawful activity . " // Pyle left the Army as planned , and in January 1970 he wrote a long story about the Army 's vast and growing spy operations . The article , which won a Polk Award in 1971 for The Washington Monthly , began : " For the past four years , the U.S. Army has been closely watching civilian political activity within the United States . " // Pyle 's journalism provided one of the first major revelations about the depth and breadth of government spying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyle helped organize . As a result of the scrutiny , the Army soon shut down its domestic surveillance efforts . // Similar operations came to light in the next few years , including those run by the FBI , CIA , and other agencies , and Congress responded to them as well . The result was a series of laws aimed at curbing government abuses . The Privacy Act of 1974 gave individuals new rights to know and correct what the government was collecting and sharing about them . The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) of 1978 gave broad powers for counterintelligence officials to monitor the agents of foreign countries . It also created restrictions . Under FISA , authorities had to demonstrate , to the supersecret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , that the principal purpose for their surveillance was foreign intelligence . But the law also restricted the use of those powers for domestic criminal investigations and prosecutions . // Those laws provided ballast for civil liberties protections for three decades . Civil liberties activists even consider FISA a key safeguard against domestic spying . This despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FISA court almost never denied an application for electronic surveillance . Some conservatives have contended that the law created unnecessary , even absurd barriers between criminal and intelligence investigators . // By the time of the Patriot Act debates , the Bush administration believed those barriers were getting in the way of uncovering terrorist cells operating in the United States and abroad . Law enforcement authorities chafed at internal guidelines imposed by the Justice Department in response to the Church Committee revelations . They claimed agents were n't allowed to monitor religious services without evidence of a crime , for instance , which made it hard to investigate mosques that might be harboring terrorists . Ashcroft claimed that the rules even prohibited investigators from surfing the Web for information about suspects . // When Dinh and his team began taking stock of needed legal changes , the legacy of the Church Committee loomed large . They saw a chance to turn back the clock . Standing in their way were people like Dempsey and Halperin. // Scores of people streamed into the ACLU 's white stucco town house on Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halperin 's email and calls from ACLU lobbyists . As with so many privacy battles , there were some strikingly strange bedfellows in attendance : liberal immigration rights groups , libertarians from the conservative Free Congress Foundation and Eagle Forum , technology-savvy activists from the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Democracy and Technology . // They filled the main conference room downstairs , overflowing through French doors into a garden , and up the stairway to the ACLU 's offices . The ACLU 's headquarters , later relocated downtown , had been the site of countless strategy meetings over the years on abortion rights , civil rights , freedom of speech , and religious freedom . " I had never seen that kind of turnout in twenty-five years , " said Laura Murphy , director of the ACLU 's national office . " People were worried . They just knew this was a recipe for government overreaching. " // They also grasped the difficulty of their position . They were trying to persuade Americans to hold fast to concerns about individual freedom and privacy while the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people were more than willing to trade off civil liberties and privacy protections for more security . Even normally privacy-minded lawmakers , including Senators Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) and Charles Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , had no intention of questioning efforts to push a bill through quickly . Representative Bob Barr ( R-Ga. ) , a staunch conservative and dedicated privacy advocate , could n't offer much hope . Barr and Murphy had worked closely together in recent years , though they came from different ends of the political spectrum . When she called him after the attacks , he confessed there was probably little he could do to temper the fervor gripping Washington . After debate over how to express clear sympathy for the victims of the attack , the group worked out a ten-point statement . " We must have faith in our democratic system and our Constitution , and in our ability to protect at the same time both the freedom and the security of all Americans , " read point No. 10 . The document was signed by representatives of more than 150 groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative activists . A few days later , they released it at a press conference and posted it on a Web site . // What kind of impact did it have ? Apparently not much . A year later , several key officials from the White House and Justice Department said they had never heard of the appeal . // Senator Leahy would describe those days as among the most challenging and emotional of his twenty-eight years in the Senate . He was saddled with the responsibility of crafting the Senate proposal for anti-terrorism legislation . He did n't want to ram a bad law through Congress , but he also did n't want to be seen as an obstructionist . He offered to negotiate a bill directly with the White House , avoiding the time-consuming committee approval process . Now he had to come up with a way of maintaining meaningful privacy protections while expanding the government 's surveillance powers . // As he worked to reconcile those competing interests , he took long walks around the Capitol and down to the Mall . Everywhere he went , the mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did when I was a law school student in the District and President Kennedy had been killed , " Leahy said . " I saw the same shock , and I wanted to make sure our shock did n't turn into panic . " It was crucial , Leahy thought , to take enough time with the legislation to get it right . // In the weeks before September 11 , Leahy and Attorney General Ashcroft had consulted frequently on a major overhaul of the FBI , which was under fire for bungling a series of high-profile cases . But the terrorist attacks quickly strained their amicable relations . Within days , Ashcroft held a press conference and called on Congress to approve the Justice Department 's legislative plan in a week 's time . Leahy was surprised  --  and irritated . The implication , Leahy says , was " we were going to have another attack if we did not agree to this immediately . " // But if he balked , Leahy risked getting hammered as soft on terrorism  --  or so he and other Democrats feared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own anti-terrorism bill , a 165-page tome called the Uniting and Strengthening America Act . On September 19 , congressional , White House , and Justice leaders gathered in an ornate room in the Capitol to exchange proposals . // Leahy , Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) , Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) , and others were there from the Senate . House Majority Leader Richard Armey ( R-Tex . ) , John Conyers , Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , and others represented the House . From the White House came counsel Alberto Gonzales . Ashcroft , Dinh , and their entourage arrived from Justice . As the meeting got started , Dinh made a beeline for a seat near the head of the conference table . Leahy and his colleagues raised their eyebrows and shook their heads . Only members of Congress were supposed to sit at the table , one of the senators told Dinh , asking him to sit with the rest of the staff . // Dinh was n't troubled by his faux pas . He and his staff were too focused on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several all-nighters at Justice . During the crash drafting effort , Dinh had slept on a black leather couch , beneath an American flag , not far from a worn paperback copy of The Federalist Papers . He handed out copies of his proposal . Leahy did the same with his draft , stressing that he thought the group should move forward deliberately . // It turned out the proposals were similar in some key respects . Both bills called for updates to the pen register and trap and trace laws , clarifying how they applied to email and the Internet . Both included provisions bolstering money-laundering and wiretap laws . They also proposed making it easier for authorities to get approval for wiretaps in spying and counterintelligence cases . The administration proposal , however , went much further . It called for indefinite detention of any noncitizen the attorney general " has reason to believe may further or facilitate acts of terrorism , " as well as the unrestricted sharing of grand jury and eavesdropping data throughout the government . It permitted Internet service providers or employers to voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small but important modification to the FISA law , changing the legal language so that foreign intelligence had to be only " a " purpose of an investigation , rather than " the " purpose , to secure surveillance authority . // Leahy and some of the other lawmakers murmured about those last provisions . Giving criminal investigators unchecked access to FISA powers could break down constitutional safeguards against unreasonable searches and seizures , leading to abuses against U.S. citizens . Dick Armey , one of the most conservative members in Congress , also expressed concern . It was Armey , in fact , who was already discussing a " sunset " provision to the new law , placing time limits on how long parts of it would remain in effect . A sunset provision would guarantee that some of the most troubling new powers would be revisited by Congress , giving lawmakers an important check on executive authority . " There were a lot of people in the room , both Republican and Democrat , " Leahy said later , " who were not about to give the unfettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned that it might take a few weeks to adopt a bill . In effect , he was urging Ashcroft to back away from his public pressure to approve a law in the next few days . When the group emerged from the meeting , Ashcroft changed his tone slightly , telling reporters that he wanted to pass a bill as quickly as possible . Leahy likewise struck a conciliatory note . " We 're trying to find a middle ground , and I think we can , " he said that day . " We probably agree on more than we disagree on . " // Leahy also made it clear he would not be rushed into approving a bill . " We do not want the terrorists to win by having basic protections taken away from us , " he said . It was a boilerplate rendering of a quotation from Benjamin Franklin that Leahy invoked repeatedly : " Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety . " // The truce between Leahy and Ashcroft did n't last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to move quickly on legislation intensified . For Jim Dempsey , it was depressing . One afternoon in late September , he was invited by Beryl Howell , Leahy 's adviser , to a legislative briefing . Howell wanted Justice Department officials and civil libertarians to describe to Senate staffers their thoughts about expanding law enforcement authority . The point was to give everyone involved more ideas . Dempsey was eager to attend . " My hope was there could actually be some sort of debate , " he says . // Then the Justice Department folks arrived . Howell had n't told them they would be discussing their proposals with civil libertarians . " They were livid , " Dempsey says . " They explicitly said , ' We do n't think outsiders should be here , and we wo n't talk unless they leave the room . ' " // Howell quickly brokered a deal . Dempsey and the other civil liberties advocates could stay to hear Justice 's presentation , but there would be no back-and-forth discussion . As soon as the Justice delegation finished speaking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dempsey says . " I was just in despair . I just thought we are never going to be able to work this out . " // At the end of September , Leahy 's staff and administration officials spent hours together thrashing out questions about civil liberties , the new police and intelligence powers , and oversight by courts and Congress . In a push to come to some agreement on the bill 's wording , Howell met with White House deputy counsel Timothy Flanigan in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room . Flanigan was representing the president as well as the attorney general in the negotiations . Howell and he tangled over whether the law would allow American prosecutors to use evidence from abroad that was obtained through methods illegal in the United States . They also differed over whether a court should serve as a check on the sharing of grand jury , wiretap , and other criminal investigative information . // Eventually , Flanigan made some concessions . He agreed that the government would not use evidence about U.S. citizens obtained abroad in a manner illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information before it could be shared among intelligence and law enforcement agencies within the United States . On October 1 , Leahy thought he had a final agreement in hand . He was so confident that he stopped by Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle 's office to assure him : " We have it all worked out . " // Leahy left the Capitol that evening feeling satisfied . He 'd done what he could to protect civil liberties by providing oversight for surveillance and domestic intelligence . But he had also moved quickly to bolster law enforcement and counterintelligence operations . No one could accuse the Democrats of coddling terrorists . The next morning , Leahy sat in his office across a polished wood conference table from Ashcroft , Hatch , Michael Chertoff , chief of the Justice Department 's criminal division , and Gonzales , the White House counsel . They 'd come together to sign off on the deal . But Ashcroft was having second thoughts about some of Flanigan 's concessions . The agreement , he told Leahy , no longer held . // Leahy felt blindsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now it looked like he did n't count . " I said , ' John , when I make an agreement , I make an agreement . I ca n't believe you 're going back on your commitment . ' " // Ashcroft 's support was critical to the bill 's approval . The Senate and the Bush administration had agreed to deliver a proposal together , and the process could not go forward without Ashcroft 's imprimatur . Flanigan downplays the dispute , saying it was only one of many disagreements in a tough series of talks that ebbed and flowed . // " There were several points in the negotihe next morning , Leahy sat in his office across a polished wood conference table from Ashcroft , Hatch , Michael Chertoff , chief of the Justice Department 's criminal division , and Gonzales , the White House counsel .

But I think it all was conducted in a spirit of we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // In any case , there was no hiding the growing animosity between Leahy and the administration . Ashcroft did n't even try . Not long after leaving Leahy 's office , Ashcroft held a press conference with Orrin Hatch at his side . " I think it is time for us to be productive on behalf of the American people . Talk wo n't prevent terrorism , " Ashcroft said , adding that he was " deeply concerned about the rather slow pace " of the legislation . // " It 's a very dangerous thing , " Hatch agreed . " It 's time to get off our duffs and do what 's right . " // Senator Leahy was deeply distressed by the collapse of the deal . He felt the administration was intent on steamrolling over him . But there was frustratingly little he could do about it . He did n't even have the political leverage in the Senate to push for the same sunset provision being championed by Armey in the Republican-controlled House . Leahy knew he would have to rely on the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do the same on securing court oversight of the government 's new surveillance powers . // Court oversight would be especially important in light of a critical but unheralded portion of the new legislation : Section 215 . For many years , FISA gave investigators access to the commercial records of people under investigation in national security cases , but only from a small range of business , including hotels , storage facilities , and car rental companies . Section 215 of the bill would greatly expand that , allowing investigators to obtain records from Internet service providers , grocery stores , libraries , bookstores  --  in essence , any business . More important , it would remove the requirement that the target of the records search be " an agent of a foreign power . " // Those changes were significant because of the data collection revolution of the 1990s . Cheaper computing power and an ever-expanding Internet enabled businesses to more easily track customer transactions . Never before had so much information been collected about so many of us  --  often in the name of giving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our names , addresses , estimated incomes , the size of a family 's house , the type of car we drive , the magazines we read , the beer we drink . Libraries used computers to keep track of what we read . Hotels kept electronic records of when we came and went , as well as the movies we watched . Bookstores knew what we bought . Many toll roads could register when we had driven by . // The implications of giving the government access to so much personal information unnerved Dempsey and other civil libertarians , who were disappointed that Leahy and his allies could n't do more to stand up to the administration . While Dempsey understood the political pressures on the senators , he worried that they did n't completely understand some of the compromises they were making . // Leahy was also rueful about the outcome . His bill , introduced in the Senate two days after his acrimonious meeting with Ashcroft , gave Justice much more power than he had originally intended . He was prepared to swallow hard and support it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on October 11 , the Senate assembled to vote . Leahy and Daschle knew every Republican would support the bill . They wanted Democrats to do the same . But Senator Russell Feingold was refusing to go along . A liberal who routinely bucked pressure from his own party , the Wisconsin Democrat had deep reservations about the bill hurtling through the Senate . He considered the provisions " some of the most radical changes to law enforcement in a generation " and was particularly worried that Section 215 gave the government too much power to sift through people 's lives . He wanted the Senate to vote on a series of amendments that would do more to protect privacy . // Feingold 's stance annoyed Daschle , who cornered him at the back of the Senate floor shortly before the vote . " The bill will only get worse if we open it up to debate , " he told Feingold . Leahy also chimed in , telling Feingold that while he agreed with almost everything Feingold was proposing , the votes simply were n't there . Leahy warned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give investigators even more extensive powers . // Feingold would n't budge . " There is no doubt , " he declared on the Senate floor that evening , " that if we lived in a police state , it would be easier to catch terrorists . If we lived in a country where the police were allowed to search your home at any time for any reason ; if we lived in a country where the government was entitled to open your mail , eavesdrop on your phone conversations , or intercept your e-mail communications ... the government would probably discover and arrest more terrorists , or would-be terrorists .... But that would not be a country in which we would want to live . " // Feingold offered his amendments , and they were rejected . One month after the attacks , the USA Patriot Act , short for Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act , passed the Senate , 96-1 . The law 's acronym spoke volumes about what the administration expected from its citizens . // Lawmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cipro . Yellow police tape encircled the Hart Senate Office Building . The House had shut down for the first time in memory . On October 17 , the capital was confronting a new threat : anthrax . It was contained in a letter mailed to Daschle , and no one knew how many people might have been exposed . Were there more letters ? Were anthrax spores floating through the Capitol 's ventilation system ? Suddenly , it became more urgent than ever to get the Patriot Act to the president 's desk . // Amid the panic , Leahy , Daschle , Flanigan , Dinh , and others gathered in House Speaker Dennis Hastert 's office to smooth out the differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill . The House bill , which had passed in the early morning hours of October 12 , included sunset and court oversight provisions Leahy had been unable to get in the Senate . There was no longer any question that the Patriot Act would include some court oversight , though not as much as Leahy and Armey wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how long the new law should be in effect . Leahy and Armey pressed for a two-year " sunset , " which would force the White House to win congressional approval of the most controversial provisions of the law all over again in 2005 . The administration wanted no time limit but eventually agreed on four years . // Sunset in 2005. // The USA Patriot Act powers went far beyond what even the most ardent law enforcement supporters had considered politically possible before the attacks . And the government moved quickly to take full advantage of both the new and existing authorities . In the first year alone , more than a thousand noncitizens were detained without being charged , and their identities were kept secret . Thousands of Muslim men  --  citizens and noncitizens  --  and others were placed under surveillance by federal investigators across the country . Their movements , telephone calls , email , Internet use , and credit card charges were scrutinized around the clock  --  a technology-driven campaign that has resulted in criminal charges against eighteen suspected al-Qaeda operatives in or near Seattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon . " We 've neutralized a suspected terrorist cell within our borders , " Ashcroft announced near the first anniversary of the terror attacks at a press conference about the indictments of six people in Portland charged with conspiring to aid al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan . He called the indictments " a defining day in America 's war against terrorism . " // In 2003 , the government , for the first time , asked for more secret wiretap warrants for terrorism investigations than for criminal cases . The FBI said it got more than 1,700 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrants , while federal and state courts endorsed some 1,442 warrants for electronic surveillance in other kinds of cases . Outside law enforcement circles , no one will ever know who was targeted by those FISA warrants . Thousands of men , women , and children had been detained and searched at airports , most of them innocent people whose names sounded similar to suspects on computer watch lists or who showed some sign of threat . College students were questioned by law enforcement and intelligence officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including some lawmakers and some judges , came to believe the Patriot Act went too far . Judge Gladys Kessler of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , for instance , ruled in 2002 that the government overstepped its constitutional bounds by refusing to give the names of more than twelve hundred people detained since September 11 , many of them initially on immigration charges . In response to a lawsuit by civil libertarians , Judge Kessler ordered the Justice Department to release the names , saying that without the information it was impossible to know whether the government is " operating within the bounds of the law . " // Kessler 's ruling was overturned by an appeals court in June 2003 , after the government argued that the secrecy was necessary to avoid compromising its investigation into September 11 and future terror plots . The Justice Department also challenged a decision by the FISA court not to grant criminal investigators the authority to use FISA primarily for criminal prosecutions . The FISA court said in 2002 that , long before September 11 , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in its requests for search warrants and wiretaps . Those warrants and wiretaps might not have been granted in criminal courts , which , unlike FISA , require evidence of probable cause . And if the FISA court would n't let criminal investigators make wide use of FISA powers , the Patriot Act would provide as much investigative muscle as the administration wants . // Near the end of 2003 , Ashcroft extolled what he thought of as the Patriot Act 's virtues during a public tour in support of the law . In lower Manhattan , Ashcroft appeared at Federal Hall , where George Washington took the oath as the nation 's first president . The attorney general was surrounded by police and prosecutors and American flags . " At times I doubted America could make it still safe , still secure today . We have had two years of safety , a sign of blessing , a sign of God 's grace upon this nation and its people that we have had 728 days of safety is second a testament to you , the men and women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforce our laws , " he said over the hum created by thousands of protesters outside . // " Freedom is not self-sustaining . It is not automatic and the security that ensures liberty does not come without effort . For two years you have expended that effort , preserving our security , protecting our liberty . All of us owe you a debt that can not be repaid . We learned the painful lessons of 9/11. // " We once had a culture of law enforcement that inhibited and prevented communication and coordination . We have constructed a new spirit of justice . We 've built America 's defense , the defense of life and liberty upon a foundation of prevention , nurtured by cooperation , built on coordination and communication and rooted in our constitutional liberties . 9/11 taught us that terrorists had outflanked law enforcement in technology , communications and information . So we have fought for the tools necessary to protect the lives and liberties of the American people . Congress provided these tools in the USA Patriot Act passed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majority : 98 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five to one ratio in the House . // " Our job is not finished , " Ashcroft added , " but we have used the tools provided in the Patriot Act to fulfill our first responsibility , that of protecting Americans . We have used these tools to prevent terrorists from unleashing more death on our soil . We have used these tools to save innocent American lives . " // As with other claims by Bush administration officials , Ashcroft offered few particulars . He was , in essence , asking us to accept his assertions on faith . // Long after its approval , Viet Dinh said he was proud of the Patriot Act and his role in creating it . He believed the law made Americans safer , just as intended . He dismisses criticism that Justice was using a heavy hand in its investigations , and that civil liberties were being compromised . While the government can examine the lives of Americans as never before , he says , the Constitution is always there as a safeguard . " It was very clear that we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust law enforcement not to overstep their bounds . Rather we say , trust the law , " Dinh said . " The attorney general said very clearly , ' Think outside the box , but not outside the Constitution . ' " // But Dinh , who returned to life as a law professor at Georgetown University , noted that the effort to protect Americans relies substantially on private information brokers and other technology companies . He knows those companies face little of the oversight of government agencies . " The amount of information publicly available to businesses is mind-boggling . It really belies the notion that each of us has an expectation to be left alone . So many people know about what we do , " said Dinh , sitting in his law school office not far from where he oversaw the drafting of the Patriot Act . " The leap in technology has not been met with a proportionate response in terms of how we think of this technology . We need to think more creatively . Not put the genie back in the bottle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's mixed use . It could be put to good or bad use . " // The situation seems far more dire to Jim Dempsey , who since the Patriot Act 's approval was named director of the Center for Democracy and Technology . Though he maintains the government needs to use information technology to protect the country , he describes the efforts by the government to make the most of personal data and the Patriot Act since 2001 as the beginning of unprecedented intrusion into American life . In 2005 , Dempsey said , he will be pressing hard to curb the Patriot Act authorities . // " It 's an electronic door-to-door search , " Dempsey said . " You ca n't physically go door to door or stop every car on the highway . But now we have the ability to do it unbeknownst to the people . Now it can be done electronically and constantly . " // Senator Leahy is convinced the Justice Department and FBI have overreached in their efforts to identify and apprehend terrorists . And like Dinh , he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring capabilities and their expanding partnership with the government . // " The temptation will be more and more  --  especially in a polarized society and a society where there is a fear , whether it 's the Red Scare in the fifties or terrorism in this century  --  to use those databanks , " he said , sitting at the same table in his office where he negotiated portions of the Patriot Act with Ashcroft . " At some point it does n't matter if they 're private or public , at some point they will be used by the government to determine who is a good American and who is a bad American . Not determined through prosecution , trial , but based on what came up on someone 's computer screen . " // Copyright ? ? 2005 by Robert O1Harrow , Jr . // Introduction : No Place to Hide // The Pennsylvania Convention Center fills two long blocks in downtown Philadelphia . With more than 400,000 square feet of exhibition space , the main hall has enough room inside to hold a track meet , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The center is known as the home of the city 's annual flower and car shows . Organizations from around the country also gather there for the proximity to the city 's historic sites : the nearby Liberty Bell , Independence Hall , and other landmarks from the nation 's birth seem to convey a certain integrity to their activities . It 's where the International Association of Chiefs of Police had its technology conference in October 2003. // For several days , thousands of law enforcement officials from the United States and abroad wandered through the exhibits . Some lingered at booths featuring dull black handguns . Others inspected a mini-tank designed for riots . They eyed crisp blue uniforms and tried on bulletproof vests . They formed a long line for the virtual shooting range , a training system that came complete with a life-sized culprit projected on a video screen . The pop , pop , pop of their practice sessions filled the air . But the great majority of police came to Philadelphia to look at a different sort of gear . They wanted the stuff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and computer tools for intelligence analysts . And in greater numbers than ever before , the information industry was there to oblige them . // The center was abuzz with an atmosphere that could be described as part carnival , part science fiction . Row after row of pitch men and women touted their companies ' ability to preserve life and liberty by helping police watch everything more closely . One contractor , Raytheon Communications Infrared , displayed a car with a night-vision camera mounted on the roof . The FBI promoted its growing use of DNA to identify people , while Treasury agents touted their growing access to reports about suspicious bank accounts . PricewaterhouseCoopers , the accounting and consulting firm , was among those offering a slick handbook describing how best to seize computers , email , and telephone calls . There was even a group , partly funded by the Justice Department , giving away a CD showing local police how to become intelligence agencies , not just crimebusters . " Turn-Key Intelligence : Unlocking Your Agency 's Intelligence Capabilities , " the CD was labeled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most agencies in the United States . " // Near the entrance was information giant ChoicePoint , a Georgia company marketing its ability to deliver billions of records about Americans online to police in every state . Names , addresses , jobs , cars , family , criminal records . ChoicePoint collects , analyzes , and sells it all . Next to its booth were firms that help law enforcement manage the ChoicePoint files . One of them showed how it delivers the reports to cell phones , PalmPilots , and laptop computers . Another , Orion Scientific Systems , claimed to help police use the data to identify and track troublemakers who might be criminals or terrorists . " Orion develops and implements all-source automated collection and analytical tools designed for intelligence , law enforcement and global security analysis , " the company 's brochure said . // Not far away was a LexisNexis display . A salesman dressed in a golf shirt showed how the company 's own collection of personal records , legal cases , and billions of news articles can help track someone down . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liens , bankruptcies ... , " the salesman said to a police chief from a little town in Ka //
