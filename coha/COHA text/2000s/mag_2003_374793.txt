In 1938 I was 21 , living in Wurzburg in southern Germany and studying at the Jewish Teachers ' Seminary . I was supposed to have an exam on Nov. 10 , the final one before I would have got my diploma that would have made me a Hebrew teacher . So on the ninth , I headed home early in the evening and went to bed at 9 so I would be refreshed the next morning . We had already heard a few days before about the assassination of Ernst vom Rath , an official at the German embassy in Paris , killed by a Polish Jew , and it was a very bad omen . Everything went fine until about 2:30 in the morning , when we were awakened by a big crash . I got up and did n't know what might have happened . I lived in a large dormitory room with two friends . I thought that it was something terrible and that we should be ready to meet the emergency . We packed our valises in case we needed to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock our door . I do n't know if we opened it or if they broke it , but they were Nazis dressed as civilians . They said , " Throw your bags against the windows . " And they went down the hall and threw three typewriters against the windows , and then they came back and went to the big dormitory room and broke several more things , like the faucets in the sink and the hanging lamps . <P> About 6 the next morning , a whole group of people came , as if they were looking at a museum , to enjoy themselves and see what the Nazis had done in our building . One man , another Nazi in civilian clothes , told us to go outside and form a line five abreast in the cobblestone street . As we walked along , the civilians at the side spat at us and called us names . We passed by the burning synagogue as they led us to the prison , and all these onlookers , they were laughing , they were shouting , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that time , the Nazis did not openly incite the whole population to kill publicly . Before , people were killed secretly and individually , but this happened openly . After that night , the whole world knew it would not get better at all , and Jews knew only a dark future . It was called the " Night of Broken Glass , " but it was more than that . You can clean up glass , but you can not do that with people . <P> Rabbi Wiener , 86 , gives tours and speeches at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and lives in Silver Spring , Md.
