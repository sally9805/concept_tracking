Truth we call it , and it 's a game . But there 's truth and there 's truth . And too much truth can be perilous . The canvas of our lives was Greenwich Village . In the years after the Great War we created with broad strokes , with style , and I must acknowledge , with brilliance . We had come here to be our true selves . In this small enclave of narrow , crooked streets lined with old brownstones and small shops , tearooms , cabarets , and speakeasies , we created our art , and we played . Oh , how we played . Certain tragic events , barely in the past , had turned my life upside down , inside out , when friends were not friends , and lovers , past loving . I 'd despaired going on , yet here I was , frivolous soul that I am , in love again . The object of my current affections was Paul Ewing , that tall young man of the broad shoulders and fair hair , whom I , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'd come , a grand group of us , to Croton , where Fordy and Kate Vaude lived the domestic life , and where some of our Greenwich Village friends had let houses all along Mt . Airy Road . Now and again , Fordy and Kate would throw a house party , and we 'd all arrive by train or motorcar , if we were lucky , for a weekend of conversation , wit , booze , games , and the lure of making love in a rustic setting . Food was the least of attractions . It was the company we kept . The last time we 'd come to Fordy and Kate 's , we 'd played with a round-robin ghost story , making it up as we went along . Larry Langner , who 's gone uptown on us and formed the Theatre Guild company , made a play of it , The Haunting of M. Vaude , and our own JigCook , the heart and soul of the Provincetown Players , took the play and mounted it for the Players . I played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd murdered her . One critic said , " The ravishing Olivia Brown , poet one moment , actress another , continues to dazzle us . " On this particular night , to the accompaniment of the voluble fire in the grand stone hearth , we 'd settled round the big trestle table in the kitchen of the farmhouse in Croton , gin lavishly replenished . Drink up , " Fordy said . " There 's plenty more where that came from . " Fordy had the moolah all right , thanks to some sort of Wall Street job by day , which also allowed him to keep a studio in the Village , where he pursued what he claimed was his true calling as an artist . Amid hoots and whistles , Paulo said , " I 'll have the name of your bootlegger . " He gave my " ravishing Olivia Brown " thigh a loving fondle . We 'd been playing charades , but our play had gone dyspeptic , and in unspoken desperation , we 'd turned to Truth . It 's deceptively simple . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , mannerism , even feature - it could be a nose - of the chosen one , and we each write a paragraph " biography " on a piece of paper concerning , let us say , the chosen 's nose . Any approach may be taken , be it sensual , humorous , or serious . We try to be literary , and clever , but we do n't always succeed , and sometimes , as you can imagine , things get personal , even savage . Folding our anonymous paragraphs , we deposited them in Dave Wolfe 's soft felt trilby . As I did mine , our fingers grazed , and Dave winked a sultry eye at me as if we had a lover 's secret . Dave , a Jew , dark and mysterious as a sheik , was writing a novel . He 'd been encamped for the last few months at our friend Max 's cottage across the way while Max was in Paris . After a good shuffling , each paragraph was read aloud by a " reader , " chosen by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the subject for the round . We 'd even inveigled the Vaude nanny , a slim , severe girl named Adelle , to join us , as Harry had gone out for a walk , holding , he quipped , no brief for Truth . Harry is H. Melville , a private investigator with whom I work from time to time . I inherited him , along with my house on Bedford Street in Greenwich Village , from my great-aunt Evangeline Brown . Her will left the downstairs flat to Harry in perpetuity . The Vaude farmhouse was a comfortable old place with low ceilings and wide floorboards . The hearth gave off enough heat to keep us from the chill outdoors . Gin did the rest . The faces of the Truth players at the table appeared to me through an undulating mist . Our hosts , Fordy and Kate . Dave Wolfe . My Paulo . Bunny Wilson , one of my editors at Vanity Fair , and his girl , Daisy . And Adelle , the nanny . We 'd played several rounds as we worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped and took a bad turn . In the days , the weeks , that followed , I would relive the strange intensity of each successive game we played that night and see it as foreshadowing the horror that was to come . On the last round , Kate Vaude was " reader , " and in her fanged presentation , each " biography " became spiteful and petty . And this last time , it was directed at poor Adelle , in particular , her heavy-lidded eyes , moistly myopic behind thick glasses . One of us , not I - as I do not write mediocre or mean verse - had written : With Judas eyes does she betray Thus will not live another day . There was more , though perhaps not nearly so sinister . Adelle 's reaction was bewilderment , and something else I could n't quite fathom . She sat in stunned silence , listening to the cruel barrage . " I love all my friends , " I said , attempting to lighten the mood , " but not right now . See what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adelle knows it 's a game , " Fordy Vaude said in his condescending manner . " Do n't you , my dear ? " He took Adelle 's " biographies " from Kate and tossed them into the fire . Adelle responded with a small , stiff smile . The " something else " was fear . " You 're quite right . I 've played the game before . " She excused herself and went upstairs . What a nasty and competitive lot we can be when we drink too much . But still , we do n't hold grudges . And we do not be-grudge one another 's achievements . The unsettling atmosphere eased with Adelle 's departure and our move from the kitchen to the parlor . Harry rejoined us , and we sat around the fire , drinking , smoking , and talking well into the night . Later , Jack Reed - writer , editor , poet , journalist ... lover - came and sat with us , in spirit only , for he was newly dead in Moscow . Already revered among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gone to Russia and reported on the Revolution , achieving international renown by writing its story : Ten Days That Shook the World . Alas , my arrival in Greenwich Village coincided with Reed 's return to Russia , so we had never had a chance to meet , but I 'd read his stories and poetry , his plays . I 'd seen in his photograph a man of some size , whose wild hair , burning dark eyes , broad intelligent forehead , all spoke to me of adventure and romance . I felt his magnetic force . Who could not ? As tales of Reed rose Bunyonesque , laughter filled the room , and I felt his presence linger like that of some departed lover . Just one last cigarette and I 'll be gone . Eventually we wore the night away , and all our talk and wine turned to making love . What woke me was my brain , aswirl with quatrains and couplets . Or so I thought at first . But , no . What had interrupted my sleep was the curious swerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the author of the most sinister of Adelle 's " biographies . " Detaching myself from the arms of my sleeping lover , I left our bed and glided down the stairs . The farmhouse was more than cold , the fires having gone out , our attentions elsewhere . Passion , with a jug of wine , could keep us warm . As I passed through the parlor , stepping round cleaving bodies on makeshift pallets , a girl I did n't know peered bleary-eyed at me over the bolster of the sofa and then sank back into Dave 's arms . I knew it was Dave from the brown corduroy shirt , which only he wore . I wondered briefly why he had n't gone back to his own house just across the road . The kitchen was dark save for the flicker of a candle near the hearth . I stood silent in the doorway . Someone had had the same thought as I. Someone , on her knees , was pawing through the ashes in the cold hearth . She turned her face into the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway and listened to her soft tread upon the stairs , the even softer closing of a door .
