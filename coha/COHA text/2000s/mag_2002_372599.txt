It instantly became one of Hollywood 's great scandals  --  the mysterious death of Thomas Ince during a cruise on William Randolph Hearst 's yacht in 1924 . Officially he died of natural causes , but rumor had Hearst murdering him . This film opts for the juicier tale . It has a lovely performance by Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies , Hearst 's beloved mistress ; she makes us see why someone might kill to keep her love . But the rest of the boaters ( including Charlie Chaplin ) are presented as idiot farceurs . The result is tiresome and tone-deaf and a disappointing comeback for Bogdanovich . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
