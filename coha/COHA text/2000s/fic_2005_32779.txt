1 In her first moment of consciousness , before opening her eyes to the world and discovering such things as floors and walls and straitjackets , Jean Grey imagined she had died ; that for all she had suffered in her life , all her terrible sacrifices , the final end would offer nothing but an eternity of suffocation , an unending crushing darkness spent in utter isolation . Her mind was blind . She felt nothing . Heard nothing . Not even Scott . Cut off , like a blade had been dropped on her neck , separating life from thought , life from sensation , life from  --  Scott ?  --  life . The remembrance of flesh came to her slowly . She became aware of her legs , curled on a flat hard surface ; her hands , tucked close and warm against a hard body . Her body , though it felt odd , unfamiliar . Not right . Jean opened her eyes . She saw a cracked white wall decorated by the shadows of chicken wire . She smelled bleach , and beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheek . Her head was strange  --  not just her mind , but her actual head  --  and her hair rasped against her cheek . No silken strands , but rough , like stubble . Her mouth felt different , too ; her teeth grated unevenly . Her jaw popped . Jean could not move her arms . This concerned her until she realized she was not paralyzed . Her arms were simply restrained against her chest , bound tight within white sleeves that crisscrossed her body like an arcane corset . Again , she tried to reach out with her mind beyond the isolation of silent mental darkness  --  Scott , where are you , what has happened  --  to find some trace of that living golden thread that was a thought , a presence , a  --  I am not alone  - -  As a child , alone was all Jean wanted to be . Alone in her head , alone in her heart , alone with no voices whispering incessantly of their fears and dreams and sins . Funny , how things could change . Her wishes had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slow , so slow  --  her head throbbed , a wicked pain like she had been struck  --  and she fought down nausea , swallowing hard . She had to get her feet back , get free and away , away to find the others . It did not matter where she was or who had done this  --  results , results are all that matter  --  only that it could not be allowed to continue . Scott will be looking for me . Yes , if he could . Jean 's last memory of her husband was his strong profile as he gazed up at the dilapidated brick faade of an old mental hospital , sagging on its foundations in a quiet neighborhood located beside the industrial hinterland between Tacoma and Seattle . Disturbing reports of rising mutant and human tensions had trickled in from the Northwest for weeks , but without anything specific enough to warrant a full investigation  --  or interference  --  from the X-Men . Until two days ago . Logan had learned through an old contact that mutants were being arrested on false charges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real hard evidence  --  except a name . Belldonne . An institute for the mentally ill , and a place  --  according to Logan 's contact  --  where the X-Men would find incontrovertible evidence that mutants were being held against their will . " And if it 's true , then it ai n't no holiday they 're having , " Logan had said . Because prison was bad enough  --  but add doctors , the ominous specter of science , experimentation , and the scenario became much worse . Mutants , despite the law protecting them , were still easy fodder for overeager scientists who wanted nothing more than to see , in the flesh , the why and how of extreme mutation . Jean understood the fascination . She simply did not think it was an excuse for unscrupulous behavior . The room was small . One window , covered in fine mesh . No furniture or cameras or anything at all that revealed the identity of her captors . The door had a small glass observation window set too high for Jean to see much but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soft , and then footsteps . Closer and closer until the doorknob rattled . Jean closed her eyes . She heard someone enter . " He still out ? " said a man . He had a rough voice , gritty like a hard smoker . " Probably pretending , " said another . Jean heard shoes scuff the floor . She peered through her lashes and saw black shoes and dark blue pants . Cologne tickled her nostrils . " Hey , " said the first man , nudging her ribs with his toe . " Hey , Jeff . You out ? " Quiet laughter . " Idiot . You actually expect him to say yes ? " The two men stood close together , relaxed and unafraid . Perfect . Jean shot out her legs and slammed her socked heels into a knee . She heard a very satisfying crunch , a sharp howl , and then she rolled left as the second man tried to subdue her . He was slow  --  but then , so was Jean . Her body felt clumsy , unfamiliar ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by that point , the man  --  large , muscular , with a flat square face  --  was too close for her to maneuver . She saw his fist speed toward her face  --  was able to turn just slightly  --  and got clipped hard enough to slam her into the wall . A low whuff of air escaped her throat , and the sound of that partial cry made her forget pain , capture  --  everything but her voice . A man 's voice , slipped free from her throat . Deep , hoarse , and horrifying . It had to be wrong , her imagination : The man with the broken kneecap howled , screaming so loud her own voice must have been drowned out , swallowed up , and yes , that was right , that had to be it  - -  A strong hand grabbed her hair and crashed her forehead against the wall . Her skull rattled ; sound passed her lips , and still it was the same , an impossible rumbling baritone that was not her voice , not feminine in the slightest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wall . " Jesus , Jeff . " " Who are you ? " she asked , listening to herself speak . Chills rushed through her arms and she glanced down , seeing what she had taken for granted upon waking , never noticing , never paying any serious attention to the changes she felt in her body . Not my body . Not my body . No breasts , a thick waist , strong broad legs . The ends of black dreadlocks , hanging over her left shoulder . Her captor did not answer . He was breathing too hard . His companion lay on the floor , muffled screams puffing from between his clenched teeth . Jean heard footsteps outside the room : people running , drawn by the sounds of violence . " Please , " Jean said , listening to herself speak in a stranger 's voice . She wanted to vomit . " Where am I ? " The man shook his head . " I thought you were getting better . No wonder Maguire wanted you restrained . " The door banged open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightstick , another had a syringe . She recognized their uniforms . " Do n't , " Jean said , staring at the syringe . " I 'm calm now . I 'm better . " " Sorry . " The man pushed her harder against the wall . " No one 's going to take a risk on you now . " Jean struggled . Without her powers , she lived in a state of semi-unconsciousness . To take that one step further  --  again  --  without knowing where the others were  --  Scott  --  or what had happened to put her in another person 's body , was more than she could bear . She was outnumbered and in a straitjacket . Perhaps the men showed surprise that the person they were accustomed to dealing with displayed sophisticated tricks in fighting them off , but they were tough and used to unruly patients . They subdued Jean . They subdued the man they called Jeff . And as Jean felt the sharp prick of the syringe in the side of her neck , she silently called out to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be listening , and then , still fighting , felt herself borne down to the hard floor like a slippery fish , slipping swiftly through the curtain of darkness into a deeper unconscious .
