One thing this town has is star power .

Southern California may be one of the top book-selling markets in the country , but walk along Melrose and you 're bound to see a prime example of the city 's notorious fixation on the shallow and physical , be it some sweet young thing reduced to tears by a bad pedicure ( true story ) or the loud boastings of an ab-baring Brad Pitt wannabe touting his new screenplay ( starring himself ) to his wheat grass-sipping friends .
