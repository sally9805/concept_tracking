At least not if you 're sick . He 'd much rather talk to you about staying healthy in the first place . How one hospital is changing the conversation that physicians have with their patients -- and pointing the way to a smarter approach to health care . Renee Turner sees sick people every day . Some get well ; others do not . As a member of the security staff at the Cleveland Clinic , she knows there is more than luck involved in who stays healthy and who does n't . Having survived cancer twice , Turner is very aware that there are things you can do to take control . That 's something she is learning every day from the physicians , patients and staff at the clinic , a 1,100-bed hospital that is testing ideas on its own staff and now might just be the future of American medicine . Take weight loss . Turner is considered morbidly obese -- you do n't have to work in a hospital to know that 's bad . That 's why she 's on a diet ; in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of her co-workers are enrolled in the hospital 's Lifestyle 180 program , an innovative approach to good health that uses cooking classes , exercise sessions and yoga to educate patients who are obese or who have high cholesterol , high blood pressure , diabetes or multiple sclerosis about how to eat better , become more physically active , manage stress and , ultimately , prevent what doctors call a major health event . " It 's what we talk about all day : changing what we eat , " Turner says . Halfway into the 48 hours of sessions , spanning six weeks , she has lost 9 lb. , and the good-health philosophy is changing her everyday behavior . She parks farther away when she goes to work or visits a mall . She looks at food labels and thinks before she eats . As an employee of the Cleveland Clinic , Turner is luckier than most : the hospital is covering the cost of her participation in the program . She even gets a " tool kit , " complete with yoga mat , recipe book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others have to do is show up . And that , argues the Cleveland Clinic 's CEO , Dr. Delos Cosgrove , is how a health-care system should work . Patients like Turner who want to live healthier lives should be encouraged -- and supported , both financially and emotionally -- to do so . In fact , we soon may have no other choice . As the cost of health care continues to climb ( 60% of U.S. bankruptcies in 2007 were due to medical costs ) , the health of our nation is not getting any better . Heart disease remains the No. 1 killer of Americans ( as it has been for all but a few years since 1900 ) , our collective waistline continues to bulge , diabetes rates march ever higher , and after steadily declining in recent decades , the smoking rate among high schoolers is leveling off . The U.S. boasts the best cutting-edge medicine in the world , yet 75% of our health-care costs are attributable to chronic , preventable diseases . In all , about 40% of premature deaths in the U.S. are caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while prevention -- intervening in patients ' lives before they get sick -- has long been part of the medical lexicon , programs to educate and encourage patients to adopt healthy behaviors have never truly been embraced . Ours is a system that rewards pills and procedures and nurtures a clinical culture in which the goal is primarily to fix what goes wrong . " I never saw a well patient in my life , " says Cosgrove of the years he spent as a heart surgeon . " They were all sick . We are in the sickness business . We need to get into the health business . " This idea is at the heart of how President Obama wants to reform health care in America ; he argued that the U.S. medical system is designed to provide disease care rather than health care . In a letter to Senators drafting health-care-reform legislation , Obama cited the clinic as a model : " We should ask why places like the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio , and other institutions can offer the highest quality care at costs well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their successes and replicate those best practices across our country , " he wrote . Exactly what are those model behaviors ? The Cleveland Clinic and its 10 sister hospitals employ 40,000 people in Ohio , Florida , Canada and the United Arab Emirates . Cosgrove 's idea is to turn those campuses into living laboratories , where healthy behavior is rewarded ( with cash incentives if necessary ) and people start thinking about health as an investment and a responsibility . In a demonstration of this commitment , Cosgrove even created new executive positions , including chief wellness officer , chief empathy officer ( now changed to chief experience officer ) and arts-program curator . These are not titles you 're likely to find in any other organization . The wellness philosophy that begins in the hospital , Cosgrove hopes , can then seed the community , then the state and the nation . Such an ambitious idea could not have found a better place to start than Cleveland , where smoking rates are above the national average , nearly 28% of the population is obese , and exercise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland , it can work anywhere . Clearing the Air Health consciousness does n't come naturally to the average CEO -- nor should it be expected to . Paying for smoking-cessation programs or gym memberships makes sense only if a company is reaping some return on its investment . The Cleveland Clinic , as the city 's largest employer , has to be more mindful of that fact than most are . Improve employee health and you cut sick days and boost productivity . Most important , you keep insurance premiums under control . And the up-front costs can be minimal . " There are things organizations can do that send a real message but cost very little , " says Cosgrove . " It does n't cost anything to have a walking program . It does n't cost anything to tell people to take the stairs instead of the elevator . And it costs nothing to say that you ca n't smoke here . " Well , almost nothing . In 2007 , Cosgrove took the controversial step of deciding not to hire any more smokers . As a high-tech hospital rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic was already viewed as an litist institution with little compassion for the community from which it draws its workforce . The no-smokers policy would cement this perception . " I had to fight everybody , including human resources , " says Cosgrove . " But this sends a message . It 's perfectly legal . It 's as much symbolic for the community as for the organization . " Since the rule went into effect , smoking rates in Cuyahoga County , which includes the city of Cleveland , have dropped from 21% to 18% . Rates have been declining since 2003 , but it did n't hurt that the clinic also spent $30,000 to support antismoking efforts throughout Ohio , culminating in a 2006 statewide ban on smoking at work and in public places . That 's just the sort of scaling up Cosgrove hopes for . But while the clinic was successfully sending a message about tobacco , it was failing miserably as a model of nutritious eating . Dr. Michael Roizen , an anesthesiologist and now the clinic 's chief wellness officer , knew something had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in the hospital 's emergency room . The patient arrived with chest pains and was put into a holding area with his family while doctors ran tests . They ended up waiting for several hours , so well-intentioned staff members offered to bring everyone some food . An orderly went out -- and came back with Kentucky Fried Chicken . " Can you believe it ? " asks Roizen . " That was quickly corrected . " The cafeteria 's new , varied menu -- particularly with its ban on trans fats -- was one response . Roizen is now working with chefs to inject more flavor and excitement into patient meals while keeping the food low in fat , salt and sugar . So far , they have redesigned 36 of the 55 meal offerings , substituting thickeners for fat , citrus flavors for salt , and peppery , spicy ingredients for sugar . But as innovative as these efforts are , what happens when patients walk out the door and leave the bubble of the clinic ? Keeping them motivated and committed to staying healthy , eating right and getting physically active is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearly all of the 5.5 million patients who have passed through the clinic 's doors since it opened in 1921 now have a digital health record , and this electronic paper trail is an ideal partner to prevention . The hospital 's patient-record system , MyChart , is synched with Google Health and Microsoft 's HealthVault to give patients the ability to upload important health information directly from devices such as scales , home blood-pressure monitors and glucometers , which measure blood sugar . That allows patients to track their progress and also helps doctors see whether treatments are working . Doctors and patients can also communicate better digitally , without the need for appointments . Lifestyle Turnaround All this , of course , makes good sense , and studies have already documented the positive impact preventive measures can have on health . What is less established is the financial case -- that prevention saves a company money . That 's the question that keeps accountants and insurers from investing in these programs , and that 's why Roizen is working to answer it . A compact , intensely energetic man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doors . His message is directed less at consumers than at the health-care industry . " The only way to justify doing wellness in a commercially viable way , " he says , " is to demonstrate that you can lower the cost of care . " Roizen is attempting to do that with Lifestyle 180 , designed for patients with chronic conditions that generate the bulk of our health-care costs . The program is run out of a facility that seems less a medical institution than a New Age retreat : a bucolic campus in nearby Lyndhurst that was once the corporate headquarters of manufacturing giant TRW . Patients who enroll in Lifestyle 180 get broken in gently . For four hours , twice a week , over six weeks , they are coached through cooking classes in which a chef passes along such tips as healthier panfrying ( use thinner pieces of fish or chicken and finer bread crumbs to reduce the amount of oil that gets absorbed ) , a dietitian teaches smart label-reading , and yoga and stress-management coaches teach meditation and how to build muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , led by Dr. Elizabeth Ricanati , take measurements , run blood tests and monitor what is happening in the patients ' bodies . The hope is that participants can eventually reduce or eliminate their dependence on insulin or blood-pressure medications or pain pills and actually stop illness in its tracks . Since the program began in October , its 114 patients have , on average , reduced their LDL cholesterol by 10 points and shaved more than 3 in. off their waistline . What 's more , the coaching does n't stop when the Lifestyle 180 sessions end . The patients come in for five follow-up sessions over the next year , and Ricanati keeps in touch with weekly e-mails of tips to keep them committed to their newfound health habits . So far , a quarter of the patients have either avoided getting on medication , reduced their dose or stopped needing drugs altogether . Whether Lifestyle 180 can actually reduce health-care costs in the long run remains to be seen . Clinic employees can join the program for free , but anyone else who wants to enroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up the tab , hoping to reap the financial return that Roizen promises . The Cleveland Clinic 's own experience suggests that Roizen 's confidence in prevention 's payoff is well founded . The hospital 's chief human-resources officer anticipates that after growing between 4% and 8% each year over the past six years , employee premiums will not increase in 2010 That 's in part due to savings from employees with chronic illnesses who are making lifestyle changes to keep themselves from getting sicker . This saves the clinic between $5,000 and $10,000 a year per patient on claims they would have otherwise filed for treatments such as dialysis , angioplasty or bypass . The next step , says Roizen , will be to see if lifestyle changes can not only hold off disease but actually reverse it , transforming the strategy into a fully developed treatment option on a par with prescriptions and surgical procedures . Dr. Dean Ornish , a longtime prevention proponent who created the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California , thinks this is possible . In 2008 he showed for the first time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be altered by diet . Men at low risk of prostate cancer were asked to choose either Ornish 's lifestyle program -- which involves eating healthier , exercising and reducing stress -- or continuing with their current habits . After three months , Ornish studied the activity of the men 's genes and found that the healthier behaviors turned on cancer-suppressing genes and turned off cancer-promoting ones . It 's just this kind of data that prevention champions hope will be enough to finally change our reimbursement system as a whole to cover programs like Lifestyle 180 . And those advocates now include a majority of consumers as well : in a recent survey by Trust for America 's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , 76% of Americans said they support an increase in funding for prevention programs . But even with such widespread support , it wo n't be easy . It took Ornish 14 years to persuade Medicare to cover his lifestyle program for avoiding heart disease . Employers have been slow to invest up front for health savings that may never accrue to them if their employees leave for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that tide may finally be turning . In Minnesota 's Twin Cities region , for instance , major companies such as Target , US Bank and Best Buy are coming together to discuss ways that investments in prevention and long-term cost savings can be shared by all the employers in the area , even if workers are moving between companies . Will prevention work ? And will our health system finally embrace the strategy over prescriptions and procedures ? We do n't . Prevention is a timeless idea , one our species has always practiced : pioneers preserved food to prevent starvation in the winter ; modern workers invest in 401(k)s to prevent destitution when they 're older . Applying the same ethos to medical care ought not be that hard -- especially since the country 's health , economic and otherwise , may depend on it .
