The Argand lamp initiated a chain of events that has led to our present method of lighting rooms . In the 1780s Ami Argand ( 1750-180 of Switzerland invented an oil lamp burner with a tubular wick that allowed air to flow up through the hollow middle of the wick as well as around the outside of it , making the flame bum brighter than any other lamp . Immediately popular , these lamps were produced in great numbers in England and France . Thanks to Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , and other Americans who had lived abroad and brought Argand lamps home with them , they also became popular in the United States.1 Between 1785 and 1843 they represented the most advanced lighting in the United States . Although the Argand burned as brightly as ten candles , it was always supplemented by candles , according to Philadelphia inventories taken between 1790 and 1840 . During the first pan of the nineteenth century , English  --  made Argand lamps in various shapes and decorative styles were retailed in the United States . The most common type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was typically vase shaped . The shape is probably the reason these Lamps are called in some inventories " vase lamps.2 The lamp fuel in the United States was whale oil , 3 with a higher quality used in winter because it heated more easily With the spread of Argand lamps , the price of whale oil increased so that only the upper middle class and the wealthy could afford to light their houses with them . Photograph // In Philadelphia craftsmen made Argand lamps to compete for a share of the market . The most prolific manufacturers there were John Leadbeater ( d. 1856 ) and Christian Cornelius , but the first makers were craftsmen such as jewelers and copperplate makers for whom the lamps were a sideline.4 One of the earliest manufacturers of the lamps was Peter Geley ( d. 1815 ) , who was listed in the 1799 Philadelphia directory as a jeweler and lapidary However , his will and inventory , in addition to tools of the jewelry trade , list , " many items indicating that he was making patent lamps.5 The firm of Leadbeater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer , according to the Philadelphia directory of that year The business included a foundry for making lamp parts as well as an assortment of hardware . Between 1815 and 1819 the firm ran a retail business for lighting and related services ( see Fig. 1 ) . In addition to making and repairing lamps and selling wicks and lamp oil , the firm rented lamps for parties and assemblies . The company disappears from the Philadelphia directories in 1842 . When the Philadelphia lampmaker Job S. Gold died in 1844 the inventory of his shop listed many kinds of shades , globes , finished and unfinished lamps , marble bases , pine oil , wicks , French shades , paper shades , imported lamps , brass parts for lamps and store fix  --  trees , and many tools used to turn brass sheets into lamps . In the inventory accompanying his will Gold held " patents rights " assess at $150.6 Photograph Facing page : PIs Ia , Ib .

The elaborate billhead shows the variety of lamps sold by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downs Collection of Manuscripts and Printed Ephemera . // The growing production of Argand lamps in Philadelphia can be traced in the exhibition reports published by the Franklin Institute , which was formed in 1824 to provide a forum for sharing ideas about inventions and other innovations in the applied sciences and industry . Between 1824 and 1874 all types of manufactured products were displayed at the institutes annual exhibition , and silver medals were given for works judged exceptional . Catalogues of these shows are a mine of information , including the comments of the judges on the quality and workmanship of the objects . The judge of the lighting exhibits in the 1826 Franklin Institute exhibition was Thomas Fletcher ( 1787-1866 ) , a well-known Philadelphia silversmith and jeweler . He reported : A sample of Mr. Leadbeater 's original productions with the workmanship fully equal to the best imported articles of the same price . That they have carefully examined the different articles exhibited and find that the brass lamps were from two manufactories only Mr. Leadbeater and Mr. Cornelius of this city . In the lamps from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made for several years , but we think the work is fully equal to those of the same description usually imported from England.7 As revealed by the annual exhibition reports , domestic lighting varied from candlesticks to sophisticated astral lamps ( a variation of the Argand lamp ) in 1824 . In 1826 candlesticks had disappeared from the Franklin Institute exhibitions and Argand lamps appeared to dominate . In the 1830s Argand lamps became increasingly complex , and stands for lamps were included in the show in 1831 . In 1840 gas fixtures by Cornelius and Company are described in its report . In 1843 a solar lamp was introduced in the United States by Cornelius , which patented them in the same year . This lamp burned lard using an adaptation of the Argand burner and caused the institute judges to comment that the solar lamp will " aid the vision of a far greater number of our citizens than will the more showy and expensive chandeliers . " 8 After 1843 Argand lamps seem to fade from the exhibitions . Christian Cornelius became world famous for creating many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang in important houses and public buildings . He had immigrated to Philadelphia from the Netherlands in 1783 and set up business as a silversmith.9 In 1816 he was listed in the Philadelphia directory as a silverplater , and by 1825 he was also described as a patent-lamp manufacturer . His one son , Robert ( 1809-1893 ) , was instrumental in expanding the lighting business after 1831 . The firm began in a single house , annexing adjoining houses as it grew ( see Pl . II ) . lo Photograph Photograph Pl . Va , Vb . Set of three Argand mantel lamps made by Cornelius and Company , c. 1831  --  1840 .

A receipt in 1836 shows that Cornelius charged five dollars for a pair of " stand lamps " and twenty-two dollars for a pair of " I light mantie lamps . " 12 The Franklin Institute reports establish that Cornelius was selling its silverplated lamps through the Philadelphia firm of Thibault and Brothers in 1825.13 The example in the exhibition that year links Cornelius 's earlier career as a silverplater with his career in lighting . When judging the 1826 exhibition Fletcher remarked on a Cornelius chandelier that " was a very beautiful specimen of workmanship and ... deserved much credit for the finish , particularly the beautiful color of the lacquer " 14 The firm was again praised for its finishes in 1838 , when it displayed an assortment of chandeliers and gas fixtures : The lamps and chandeliers of Messrs . Cornelius and Co. are designed and executed in a manner which for taste and durability , has never been equaled in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be new ) struck the Committee as greatly superior to anything of the kind they had ever seen . Some of the articles submitted by the same ingenious manufacturers are handsomely ornamented with etched figures . The Committee are not aware that etching on brass has , until now , ever been practiced.15 The firm 's most common finish was gold lacquer , but it also produced bronze-colored finishes as well . An account written in 1857 describes how Cornelius made lamps and girandoles . First the brass plates were spun on a lathe over a wooden mold to create the font These parts were united with the cast parts and sent to the finishing room . There they were dipped in a series of baths of varying and unknown chemical makeups , but containing gold pigment and lacquer . The baths created a " rich and uniform , yet dull gold color . " Other craftsmen burnished the object with tools of highly polished steel or bloodstone to bring out the highlights to contrast with the dull or " matted " areas . Then the object was lacquered to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of the utmost importance , and requires the lacquer to be scientifically made and skillfully applied , to ensure a rich and lasting gold color , unaffected by the action of the atmosphere . " 16 The double-armed Argand lamp made by Cornelius shown in Plates Ia and Ib is one of a set of four with the original finish and shades . The cast-iron weight in the base is marked with an upper case " C ' cast into it that is similar to the upper case " M " that Thomas Messenger , an English manufacturer of Argand lamps , had cast into his weights . A related pair of Cornelius mantel lamps ( see Pl . IV ) have shallower , pear-shaped fonts , hk since they contain fuel for only a single burner . These have been stripped of their original finish . Otherwise the chief difference between the two sets is the ornament along the arms that feed the fuel to the burners . By making such slight changes Cornelius was able to offer a variety of products to its customers . The three-piece set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its original gold lacquer finish and original burners . It contains elements from the sets shown in Plates la , lb , and IV , but the sand-cast rings from which the prisms hang are reticulated only on one side . The finials are stylized sheaves of wheat modeled in the round yet with the flat , graphic quality typical of the Cornelius firm 's ornament . Another set of three mantel lamps ( Pls . VIa , VIb ) , in this case with a bronze  --  colored finish , shares certain features with the marked Cornelius sets . On the center lamp the decorative arm brackets are modeled on both sides . By contrast the side lamps have one-sided acanthus leaf brackets attached to the prism ring , which are also found on the Cornelius lamps in Plates Ia , lb , and IV . The gothic " window " in the base of all three lamps is not stamped with the impression of mullions and glass panes as it is on the lamps in Plates Ia , lb , and IV . Other parts on this set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The finial , for example , is a juniper berry surrounded by curling leaves , expertly cast and finished in England . The prism ring brackets created by Cornelius on his marked lamps are not as sharply cast as the finial on this lamp . Cornelius may have imported these better finished parts from England or he may have bought them from a retailer in Philadelphia . He used them to give his lamps a richer effect until he was able to make the parts himself . The use of imported and domestic parts enabled Cornelius to compete with retailers of imported Argand lamps . The impressive pair of double-armed Cornelius lamps shown in Plates VIla and VIIb have an expertly cast figure of a Roman soldier on the base . The bronze-colored finish with highlights of gold lacquer is original . All the parts are of the highest quality and were made in the Cornelius shop . Photograph Pls . V1a , V1b .

At present there are no known Argand chandeliers bearing the Cornelius mark , but there are examples of marked astral lamps ( see Pl . II ) .17 As the nineteenth century progressed , kerosene replaced whale oil and lard as a cheap and plentiful fuel , but the Argand burner continued to be used .
