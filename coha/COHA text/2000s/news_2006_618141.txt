<p> In a shop lined with shelves of pricey merchandise , the music is blaring and it 's in your face . The lyrics are suggestive of sexual promiscuity and two-timing girlfriends . <p> But this is n't rock or rap thumping in a hip boutique , it 's opera  --  Pavarotti singing " La donna e mobile "  --  and the shop is EatZi 's , a gourmet market in Dunwoody . <p> " The whole idea is to play opera and play it loud , " says EatZi 's supervisor Maria Viloria . Some people have complained that the music is too loud , she says , but more approve . " We 're mostly a to-go place in a European style , so it 's opera and it 's loud . That 's a part of our identity . " <p> But there is more to this suburban sophistication than meets the ear , according to experts who study the potent intersection of music , marketing and psychology . <p> When peddling Provencal sea salt  --  or deterring crime , or boosting efficiency in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played as much for its psychological properties as for the art-for-art's-sake aesthetic of the concert hall . <p> In retail , says James Kellaris , a marketing professor at the University of Cincinnati , " music can create moods and reinforce the store 's image by associative learning  --  where ' classy ' music implies ' classy ' store . " <p> Beyond these obvious effects , he adds , " music can help shape customers ' time perception , lower sales resistance , and increase willingness to spend . " <p> For most people , classical music is complex and relatively unfamiliar . So exposure to opera shrinks what psychologists call a person 's subjective time , relative to what the clock says : By working harder than usual in a short period of time , your brain overcompensates by making you feel like you 've spent less time in the shop . <p> Coupled with the music 's sonic complexity , aggressive loudness can help lower a shopper 's ability to critically evaluate beautifully packaged merchandise or a sales pitch . <p> Longer visits <p> Together , these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more overall spending . <p> ( That is , unless the shopper happens to be a music connoisseur , since hearing even a snippet of a familiar song expands the subjective timer . ) <p> EatZi 's gets opera from a satellite radio service called DMX Music , which broadcasts everything from ambient background sounds to country and top-40 pop . <p> EatZi 's subscribes to the " Arias and Overtures " program , which the DMX Web site pitches to retailers this way : " Classical and ambient music invites customers to linger in upscale boutiques , and says ' distinguished ' the moment you walk in ... " <p> Kellaris says such music also serves as an " aspirational reference , " a soundtrack to fantasies of upward mobility . <p> " The deli is telling us , in effect , ' Our antipasto is expensive , but if you eat it you 'll be as sophisticated and prosperous as people who vacation in Tuscany or hold season tickets to the opera . ' " <p> A SWAT team of sound <p> It seems music that reduces brain power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people find the stuff repellent . <p> On a recent sweltering afternoon on the dimly lit platform of the Decatur MARTA station , a warbly allegro from Handel 's " Water Music " filled the air . While the quieter nuances of the piece were lost in the station 's vast space , its bold rhythms and pomp came across clearly . <p> For $56 a month , MARTA subscribes to a satellite service from ambient music provider Muzak . Although the company is famous for fare such as the mind-numbing renditions of Beatles songs heard in elevators and waiting rooms , Muzak offers more than 100 different audio programs , from disco-fueled " HI-NRG " to contemporary Christian . <p> MARTA riders hear Muzak 's " light classical " program . It 's beamed into all 36 stations ( although the audio equipment is broken in many locations ) . <p> Muzak describes the program as suitable for " banks , fine dining establishments , medical facilities , garden centers , grocery stores , museums , arts facilities , bookstores , " and the target audience as 29-79 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> What Muzak fails to mention is the program 's apparent crime-fighting abilities . <p> The effect has been documented in England . In 2004 , after gangs infested London Underground stations in some of the city 's most crime-ridden neighborhoods , British Transport Police turned to a weapon of last resort . In six months , they cut robbery by 33 percent , staff assaults by 25 percent and vandalism by 37 percent . <p> Their ammo ? A shock-and-awe assault of Mozart minuets and Pavarotti arias , pumped onto station platforms like sonic napalm  --  the very same repertoire that helps EatZi 's sell a $12.99 applewood-smoked bacon and Jarlsberg cheese quiche . <p> MARTA deputy general manager Franklin Beauford says he had n't heard of classical music 's crime-deterrent potential , and doubts its efficacy . " It 's my experience that criminals do n't pay attention to what they 're listening to , pickpockets and vandals do n't care what the music is , " he says . " , he says , the music is merely a means to provide " a pleasant environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' Remarkable ' effects <p> Then there 's the medical use of classical music . <p> Marc Rynearson is a classical programmer at DMX Music . He created the " Arias and Overtures " heard at EatZi 's and is developing music for hospitals . <p> " Waiting rooms get one sound , a chapel gets music that 's very beautiful and reflective with a spiritual context , such as instrumental pieces from a Bach cantata , " he explains . " In the maternity ward , tempos will be a bit faster , and we 'll create a gentle atmosphere with cute instruments like the oboe and the harp , and include lots of lullabies . There 's documentation that the effects of classical music on mind and body are remarkable . " <p> The new DMX mix , however , wo n't include a " product " for operating rooms , where some doctors are playing deejay themselves . <p> On a typical day at the DeKalb Medical Center , Dr. Sidney Stapleton will reach into a satchel , pick out a CD and slide it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery . <p> Once his patient has been anesthetized , a nurse hits the play button . Music , such as Russian pianist Yevgeny Kissin easing into a Beethoven sonata , quietly but insistently fills the operating room , a counterpoint to the regular beeps of the monitors . Everyone in the room listens while they work . <p> Only about a quarter of surgeons at the center play music in the O.R .  --  the decision to do so , and the repertoire , is at the discretion of the senior surgeon . Most who do their cutting at DeKalb choose a soundtrack of light rock or country . <p> " I find classical music makes for a great environment in the O.R. , " says Stapleton , 66 . " Often , when the music 's playing , there 's less chatter , and everyone 's more efficient , you can concentrate when you need to , and the time passes quickly . " <p> He 's learned to limit his choices . The tiled acoustics of the operating room forbids music with too wide a dynamic range  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  so big romantic symphonies , opera and choral music are off-limits , he says . Baroque orchestral music and a spectrum of piano music , from Bach to Prokofiev , usually gets the call . <p> Still , he concedes , " if the operation is too challenging , I wo n't bother with it and , anyway , it 's not fair for me to hold the O.R . staff captive with my musical preferences . " <p> When they 're awake , patients usually like what they hear , he says . <p> During a routine procedure not long ago , Stapleton put on one of his favorites : Pianist Dinu Lipatti playing a Bach-Busoni chorale . <p> " I got a thank-you note from the patient , " he recalls . " She wrote : ' What a delightful experience to be ushered into anesthesia to the sound of Bach .
