<p> Glenbard North coach Bob Miller is n't about to pretend that this Elite Eight stuff is old news to him . After fielding questions from the media , Miller had questions of his own : What time was the shootaround ? What color uniforms should his players wear for the team photo ? <p> " We 've never done this before , " he said . " It 's a new experience . " <p> The Panthers beat favored West Aurora in the supersectional after losing twice to the Blackhawks during the regular season by a total of 50 points . They play Westinghouse at 12:15 p.m. today in the first game of the Class AA state quarterfinals . <p> " After beating West Aurora , we have the confidence that we can play with any team , " said guard Greg Klos , who had 29 points Tuesday , including seven three-pointers . " We are just looking forward to it and proving everyone wrong again . " <p> But Miller admits he is surprised by his team 's performance . <p> " We had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the school , " he said . Glenbard North had reached a sectional final only once , in 1982 . <p> " The kids are kind of comfortable with the underdog role right now , " Miller said . <p> The hot-shooting Klos , who averaged three points off the bench for the Panthers last season as a junior , is the key to Glenbard North 's offense . Defensively , " we start at the basket and work our way out , " Miller said . <p> Steve Fifarek , the Panthers ' 6-5 senior , will have a lot to handle in Westinghouse 's inside lineup of 6-4 Darius Glover , 6-4 Jamarcus Ellis and 6-6 Richard Russell , a lineup Warriors coach Chris Head said is the biggest he has had . <p> Head confessed that his players were a bit disappointed not to be playing West Aurora , who beat them for the title in 2000 . But he and his team learned lessons from that trip to the final . <p> " The biggest challenge for a city team going Downstate is making sure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a plan , " he said . " We want to put ourselves in position to win the state championship . " <p> Central Suburban conference rivals Highland Park and New Trier will play for the second time this season in the second quarterfinal at 1:45 p.m . New Trier won the regular-season meeting 53-48 on Dec. 4 . <p> Like Glenbard North , Highland Park is making its first trip Downstate . But the Giants have no intention of being satisfied with just making it to Peoria . <p> " We know it 's great to get Downstate , but we want to try to continue our season as long as possible , " guard Joey Paul said . <p> Paul is the Giants ' leading scorer ( averaging 16.1 points ) , but he had an off night Tuesday when he scored eight . But Highland Park still prevailed . <p> " Joey 's picked up our guys a lot of games , " coach Paul Harris said . " It was nice to see guys ... pick up Joey . " <p> New Trier has relied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Romey , a four-year varsity player and three-year starter . Romey averages 9.9 points . <p> " James scored more points last year , " New Trier coach Rick Malnati said . " This year , his main focus was on the team , and that shows up . " <p> Romey gets support from forward Ted Rosinski ( 10.9 ppg ) , guard Josh Goodman ( 8.4 ) , guard Brett Sortal ( 6.9 ) and reserve forward Nick Nikitas ( 6.9 ) . <p> " Instead of great individuals down in Peoria , it looks like there 's a bunch of really good teams , " Malnati said . <p> Malnati said center/forward Bob Anderson is fully recovered from a staph infection after two knee surgeries . <p> Of course , there are great individuals playing in Peoria , and two of them will suit up for Springfield Lanphier , the No. 2 team in the most recent Associated Press poll : guard Richard McBride and forward Andre Iguodala . <p> The Lions will face Thornwood at 6:30 p.m . Lanphier games often resemble track meets , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump at last year 's state track meet . <p> " With the athletes that we have , we like to get the ball out on the fast break , " coach Craig Patton said . " If we can get the ball in Andre 's hands or Richard 's hands , we feel like we 're doing quite well . " <p> Thornwood players have said all season they can play any tempo . The Thunderbirds also have three players who had big roles in last season 's run to second place : guard Pierre Thomas , and forwards Melvin Buckley and David Moss . <p> Without the burden of expectations that last year 's Eddy Curry-led team carried , " it takes a little more pressure off the kids , " coach Kevin Hayhurst said . " They 're going down there and there 's not all the hoopla . " <p> In the final game , Downstate powers Centralia and Moline will meet at 8:15 p.m . Centralia ( 25-5 ) is led by forward Matt Shaw ( 14.4 ppg ) . Guard Anthony Beaird averages 20.9 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Westinghouse ( 27-5 ) vs . Glenbard North ( 23-7 ) <p> When : 12:15 p.m. , Ch. 20 . <p> Warriors starters : Jamaal Brown , 5-10 senior guard ; Clide Crosby , 5-10 senior guard ; Richard Russell , 6-6 senior forward/center ; Jamarcus Ellis , 6-4 sophomore forward ; Darius Glover , 6-4 senior forward . <p> Panthers starters : Ray Gamaro , 5-9 senior guard ; Greg Klos , 6-2 senior guard ; Joel Pelland , 6-4 senior forward/center ; Todd Evans , 6-2 senior forward ; Steve Fifarek , 6-5 senior forward/center . <p> Outlook : The Panthers shot 72 percent from three-point range Tuesday and will need to stay hot to stretch the Warriors ' defense . In addition to Klos ( 16.6 points per game ) , Pelland ( 12 ppg ) and center Fifarek ( 8.3 ) are Glenbard North 's main threats . Forward Mike Paradowski also has led the Panthers in scoring on occasion off the bench . Westinghouse prides itself on creating points off turnovers and running the fast break , and will have both size and speed advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Public League championship Sunday , has come on strong for the Warriors in the playoffs . Ellis , an inside-out threat , also has played well . Brown , a sophomore on the Warriors ' 2000 state runner-up whose hero is Loyola junior and Westinghouse alum David Bailey , will be the man charged with getting them the ball . Officiating could be a factor , as state-tournament referees sometimes call a tighter game than Public League players are used to . <p> Highland Park ( 24-5 ) vs . New Trier ( 24-6 ) <p> When : 1:45 p.m. , Ch. 20 . <p> Giants starters : Joey Paul , 6-3 senior guard ; Scott Schaff , 6-2 senior guard ; Matt Greenberg , 6-3 senior forward ; Jason Vismantas , 6-4 junior forward ; Andy Linton , 6-3 senior forward/center . <p> Trevians starters : Josh Goodman , 6-3 senior guard ; James Romey , 6-2 senior guard ; Brett Sortal , 6-1 junior guard ; Ted Rosinski , 6-3 senior forward ; Bob Anderson , 6-3 senior center/forward . <p> Outlook : The Central Suburban crossover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple offensive and defensive looks to adjust to their opponents . Both pride themselves on fundamentals . And both say they are much improved since their last meeting in early December , which New Trier won 53-48 . The Giants ' leading scorer has been Paul ( 16.1 ppg , 5 rpg , 3 assists ) , but Barrington 's players said they were unprepared for the quickness of Paul and Schaff . With Linton and Vismantas in the post , Highland Park has been undersized against most opponents this year but will not have that problem against the Trevians . New Trier has played one of the toughest nonconference schedules around  --  Farragut twice , Young twice , Julian , Thornwood , Schaumburg  --  and is reaping the benefits . Five players share the bulk of the scoring  --  Rosinski ( 10.9 ppg ) , Romey ( 9.9 ) , Goodman ( 8.4 ) , Sortal ( 6.9 ) and reserve Nick Nikitas ( 6.9 ) . Sortal provides the spark on defense . <p> Lanphier ( 30-1 ) vs . Thornwood ( 27-4 ) <p> When : 6:30 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5-9 junior guard ; Tony Smith , 6-1 senior guard ; Richard McBride , 6-3 junior guard ; Andre Iguodala , 6-6 senior forward ; Niccos Scott , 6-3 senior forward . <p> Thunderbirds starters : Geremie Allison , 5-9 junior guard ; Pierre Thomas , 6-3 senior guard ; David Moss , 6-5 senior forward ; Melvin Buckley , 6-7 senior forward ; Cornelius Jones , 6-5 senior forward/center . <p> Outlook : Having had a marquee player of their own last year in Eddy Curry , the Thunderbirds now face two in Iguodala ( 23.5 ppg ) and McBride ( 18.3 ppg ) . With his long arms , Iguodala is at the front of the Lions ' press . Foul trouble could be an issue for Iguodala ; after Lanphier blew away most opponents in the regular season , he fouled out for the second game in a row Tuesday . McBride , who had 19 points Tuesday , and guard Tony Smith ( 12.5 ppg ) will have to pick up the slack if Iguodala gets in early foul trouble . Lanphier likes an up-tempo game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any style its opponents try . Behind veterans Moss ( 14.2 ppg ) , Buckley ( 13 ppg ) and Thomas , the Thunderbirds also have depth  --  they played 10 people in Tuesday 's win over Joliet  --  a commodity the Lions are short on . Thornwood also is accustomed to facing great players and great teams ; in addition to the experience gained last year and a tough nonconference schedule , the Thunderbirds might have had the most difficult path to the state quarterfinals . <p> Centralia ( 25-5 ) vs . Moline ( 25-4 ) <p> When : 8:15 p.m. , Ch. 20 . <p> Orphans starters : Lance Marcum , 6-2 senior guard ; Brian Dinkelman , 5-10 senior guard ; Caleb Edson , 6-1 senior guard/forward ; Matt Shaw , 6-6 sophomore forward ; Jon Smith , 6-6 senior forward/center . <p> Maroons starters : Anthony Beaird , 6-1 senior guard ; Wesley McCorkle , 6-0 sophomore guard ; Jay McAdams-Thornton , 6-3 senior guard/forward ; David Burke , 6-2 senior guard/forward ; Travis Nunn , 6-5 senior forward/center . <p> Outlook : The Orphans boast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , with 1,917 and counting . Marcum ( 13.3 ppg , 4 apg ) , the MVP of the Centralia Holiday Tournament , is the leader for Centralia , with Shaw ( 14.4 ppg , 8 rpg ) and Smith ( 12.4 ppg ) adding support . The Maroons graduated four of five starters from last year 's Elite Eight team , but they have returned thanks to good chemistry and what coach Frank Baxter calls a team " void of egos . " McAdams-Thornton ( 14.6 ppg , 8 rpg ) is the one returning starter and leader of the team , and Beaird ( 20.9 ppg ) is an outside shooting threat . Nunn is the cousin of light heavyweight boxer Michael Nunn .
