Charles Martin slipped quietly out of bed , careful not to wake Myra . He looked around the dim room , trying to figure out what , if anything , had wakened him from his deep sleep . All was quiet in the huge room . There was no air-conditioning making humming noises on Big Pine Mountain because it simply was n't needed . He looked toward the open windows , where the sheer curtains moved with quiet gracefulness . Turning his head , he tried to decide if one of the dogs might have barked or if the birds were rustling in the big pines outside the window . Except for Myra 's soft intake and exhalation of breath , the silence was deafening . <p> Charles knew sleep was out of the question because he was wide-awake . He got up and made his way to the bathroom , where he showered , shaved , and got dressed . The red numbers on the digital clock sitting on the mantel said it was three in the morning , an ungodly hour to be waking up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entirely outside of his experience . When he was planning a mission for the girls , sleep was something he usually did without . <p> In the kitchen , he made coffee . Just as he was pressing the button to start the automatic drip , he realized something was wrong . He looked down at his trembling hands . His hands never trembled . Never . He jammed them into his pockets as his mind raced . Myra was sound asleep , which meant all was well with his dearly beloved . One of the dogs , Murphy or Grady , would have alerted him if something was amiss with the Sisters . The phone was n't ringing . So what could possibly be wrong ? He listened to the silence around him as he tried to figure out if it was him or something else . Something was spooking him , and he did n't like the feeling . He 'd never had such an ominous feeling before . Even when he 'd been a covert agent for Her Majesty , he 'd had nerves of steel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the situation , his mind never going off on tangents . <p> Charles almost jumped out of his skin when he heard the last cheerful plop coming from the coffeemaker . He poured a cup and carried it to the War Room , where he checked his incoming e-mail and faxes . There was nothing to be seen , both machines glaring at him like two angry dark eyes . What the hell is wrong ? He turned and walked back out to the main part of the house and opened the front door . The velvety night was dark and quiet . He walked over to the bench under a tall pine and sat down . The pungent scent of pine was so strong , he felt light-headed . Sipping his coffee , he lit up one of the cigarettes he thought no one knew about . He puffed furiously , hoping the cigarette would calm his twanging nerve endings . <p> Head lowered as he tried to grapple with what he was experiencing , Charles let his gaze drop to the watch on his wrist . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halogen lamp in the center of the compound : 3:45 . He raised his head to look around . He 'd never felt as lonely as he felt just then , that very second , in the whole of his life . He wondered suddenly if he was going to die . He shivered . For some reason , he 'd never given his own death a thought until then . He immediately discarded the image . He squeezed his eyes shut as he tried to grapple with his feelings and his morbid thoughts . <p> Desperate , Charles fired up a second cigarette . After the first two puffs on his previous cigarette , he 'd let it turn to ash . He inhaled deeply and coughed . Terrible , ugly , nasty habit , but he could understand why people smoked . Suddenly , he felt calm . The hand holding the cigarette was rock steady . His head felt clear , his senses sharp . This is it , he told himself . Either I 'm going to die , or something is going to happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never without vibrated . In that single instant Charles knew he was n't going to die . He was sharply aware of the night around him , the rustling of the pines , the cough of a frog somewhere deep in the forest . For one second he thought he could actually hear the clouds move overhead . His uncanny sixth sense told him there was a possum or a raccoon within spitting distance . The sudden glow of two yellow eyes confirmed his feeling . A maple tree to the left of him rustled impatiently in the early-morning breeze . Off to the right , he could hear the creak of the cable car in its nest in the housing unit as the morning breeze kicked over into a light wind . Except for those rare times when he slept so deeply a building could have fallen on him and he would n't have waked , he had always been a poor sleeper , waking just the way he 'd woken a little while ago . It had taken him a long time to get used to the mysterious moans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the other mountain noises . <p> Dreading what he was going to hear on the special phone but needing desperately to know who was on the other end , he flipped it open and brought it to his ear . He rather thought he said hello , but later on he simply could n't remember . What he did remember was the brisk voice that said , " Sir Malcolm , " by way of greeting . <p> It was already midmorning across the pond . For his special friend to call him at that hour had to mean something very serious was wrong somewhere , and somehow it affected either him or the Sisters . Somehow Charles managed to find his voice . <p> " Tell me straight off , Bess . " He took a second to wonder why he was calling his friend " Bess . " Normally he called her " Liz . " Bess was reserved for times of crisis . " Do n't blather on , I can take it , whatever it is . " Charles 's long years of friendship allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in all of England . <p> " Very well . But , please , sit down , Sir Malcolm . " <p> " Bloody hell , Bess , would you still tell me to sit down if I was in bed ? Even the squirrels and birds are n't awake yet . I woke about an hour ago , knowing something was wrong . " Then Charles 's voice changed , it grew softer , almost pleading when he said , " Just tell me , and I 'll deal with it . " <p> Charles listened , the color draining from his face . Now , he thought , I really am going to die . I really am . The voice nudged him for a response twice before he could make his tongue work . " I heard it all . Thank you for calling me . Yes . Yes , I will be ready . " The special phone went back into his pocket . <p> In a daze , Charles walked back to the main house on leaden feet to his bedroom , where he packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myra , who was still sleeping soundly . He wanted to touch her , wake her , to tell her ... so many things . Things he did n't understand . Instead , he left the room as quietly as he 'd entered it . <p> * * * <p> Across the compound , Annie , on one of her nocturnal trips around the house she lived in , saw the lights go on in the main house . It was n't all that unusual to see the main house lit up in the wee hours of the morning . Charles was a notorious nonsleeper , often working through the night , especially if they were on a mission . He was a master at those ten-minute power naps the media touted . But something prickled at the back of her neck , right between her shoulder blades . She always referred to the feeling as her own personal warning system . She did n't stop to think as she put on a robe and slippers and quietly left the house . She walked across the compound and up the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Annie walked out to the kitchen , where Charles was sitting on a kitchen stool , staring into space . To her mind 's eye , he looked terrible . She poured coffee and sat down on the opposite stool . That was when she saw the bulging duffel bag . <p> Annie 's stomach muscles crunched into a knot . She did n't bother beating around the bush . " Where are you going , Charles ? It 's not even light out yet . Were you going to leave us a note or just ... disappear ? Does Myra know you 're leaving ? Of course she does n't , or she 'd be here in the kitchen with us . You need to say something , Charles , and you need to say it now . " <p> " I ... I have to go away , Annie . I 'm not sure when I 'll be back or even if I will be back . I had some ... Well , let 's just say I had some disturbing news that I have to act upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean is ... " <p> " You 're sitting here right now . I am sitting here right now . That means to me that you had time to wake Myra , wake all of us , to tell us whatever the hell is going on with you . What does that mean , you do n't know if you will come back ? Exactly and precisely , what does that mean ? What are you waiting for ? Ah , a helicopter , right ? Are you going to tell me or not ? " <p> Charles looked down at his watch . He had eleven minutes until the British helicopter set down on the mountain . " Fetch the others , Annie , but be quick . I just have eleven minutes . " <p> Annie ran . She rang the bell on the front porch of the cabin she lived in with the girls . She shouted to them to meet her in the kitchen of the big house , then ran , stumbling to Myra 's room , where she literally pulled her from the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charles is packed and ready to leave . A helicopter is coming , and he said he might never come back . Get with it , Myra , stop staring at me like a lunatic . Dress ! That 's a goddamn order . Do n't forget your pearls , " she added as an afterthought as she raced out of the room . That was a stupid thing to say ; Myra was never dressed until the pearls were around her neck . <p> Annie arrived back at the kitchen just as the others stumbled across the dining room in various modes of dress . Myra was the last one in , sloppily dressed in a sweat suit . She was trying to smooth down her hair as she looked around in a daze . Then both hands flew to the pearls around her neck . <p> " Eight minutes and counting , " Annie said breathlessly . " Go for it , Charles . The highlights , since time is short . We can fill in the blanks ourselves . " <p> " What 's going on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she eyed the bulging duffel bag at Charles 's feet . Her hands feathered the pearls at her neck , a sure sign that she was agitated . <p> " I had a disturbing phone call from ... from a friend across the pond a little while ago . It seems my son was in a plane crash and is in extreme danger . " <p> " Son ! What son ? " Myra screeched at the top of her lungs . <p> The others chimed in , wanting to know why he 'd never mentioned a son . <p> Charles stiffened . " You were n't told because I did n't know I had a son until two hours ago . A long time ago , when I was just a lad , there was a young lady ... It 's a long story . I was a commoner , she was n't . I left to go on to other things , and I assumed she went back to her family in South Africa . Not only do I have a son and a daughter-in-law , I have three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems my son wanted it that way on orders from his mother , who is deceased . <p> " I have to go . I want you all to understand I have no other choice . " <p> Overhead , the solid whump-whump of the helicopter could be heard . <p> " And you expect me to believe that ? " Myra shouted , tears rolling down her cheeks . <p> Charles 's tormented voice hung in the room like a death knell . " Yes , Myra , I do expect you to believe that . Because it 's true , and I 've never lied to you . I have to say good-bye now . I 'll be in touch when I can . " <p> Speechless , the women just stared at Charles as he bent to pick up his duffel bag . <p> " Do n't bother getting in touch and do n't bother coming back , " Myra said coldly , the tears drying on her cheeks as she turned away to stare out the kitchen window at the darkness outside . <p> " Myra ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myra was not going to back down , Charles let his shoulders slump . He started toward the door . A second later he was gone , the door closing softly behind him . There was a sense of finality to the sound . <p> The women rushed to Myra , all of them babbling and jabbering , but it was Annie who grabbed hold of Myra 's shoulders and shook her like a rag doll . " Do n't be a fool , Myra . Are you out of your mind ? That man needs you right now , the way you needed him when Barbara died . Hurry , you can fight with him on the flight . If you do n't go you 'll regret it for the rest of your life . Go ! " <p> The others pushed Myra toward the door . " But I 'm not dressed ... he lied to me ... Well , maybe he did n't lie but he should have woken me to tell me ... I ca n't just ... go . I need my things . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pearls , you do n't need anything else , " Annie shouted to be heard over the landing aircraft . " Run , Myra ! " <p> The women raced from the room , out onto the porch , down the steps , across the compound as they half-dragged and half-pulled Myra to the helicopter pad . Somehow they managed to catch up to Charles , who was so stunned that he stopped in his tracks , his arms extended to clasp Myra to his chest . <p> The other Sisters stood in a huddle , the wind from the helicopter blades almost blowing the hair off their heads . They waved furiously , shouting words that could n't be heard . <p> When the bird in the sky was just a speck , they trudged back to the main cabin , Annie in the lead . <p> Back in the kitchen , they fell to their assigned tasks and within minutes they had breakfast on the table . <p> " Eat ! You know Charles 's rule : first we eat , then we talk , " Annie ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pancakes and eggs , but for the most part all they did was stir the food around on their plates . Murphy and Grady waited patiently , knowing the food would find its way into their food bowls . <p> The minute the table was cleared and the dishwasher was humming , Isabelle poured fresh coffee . " Let 's talk , " she said as she plopped down in her chair . <p> " Charles has a family he did n't know about . How is that possible ? Charles knows everything . How could he be ignorant of an entire family ? If it was a secret , how did Her Majesty know about it ? " <p> Something funny was going on , they finally agreed when all the questions they asked one another had no answers . <p> The Sisters ' concern turned to themselves . <p> " We 're rudderless . There 's no one at the helm . What are we supposed to do ? " Kathryn demanded . <p> " It 's not exactly like we 're busy , " Nikki said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , at the moment . " <p> " Yes , but what if something comes up ? What do we do then ? " Alexis asked . " And I hesitate to mention this , but we have n't heard a word from our president-elect and the pardon she promised us . Maybe this is a good time to , you know , sort of look into it . " <p> " Why do n't we have a party ? " Yoko suggested . " We can invite Lizzie , Maggie , Jack , and Harry , and anyone else we think is safe to invite . " <p> " That 's definitely out of the question . That 's one of Charles 's rules . We ca n't go against it , as much as I would love to have some fun and see Jack , " Nikki said . <p> " So ... we just sit here on this damn mountain and wait to see if Charles comes back . He said straight out he might not return . We need to make some plans , " Kathryn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am , as of this moment , appointing myself as our new PM and will take the helm , " Annie said . <p> Her Sisters laughed . " Annie , they only have prime ministers in England . You ca n't be a PM , " Alexis said . <p> " No , no , no . I did n't mean prime minister . I meant point man . Or , in this case , PW , which means point woman . I considered saying point person , but PP does n't seem quite right . " <p> A couple of the girls snickered . <p> " That 's another way of saying I 'm taking charge ! If there are any dissenters , now is the time to ... uh ... dissent . " <p> A rousing chorus of yahs echoed in the kitchen just as Annie 's cell phone rang . The Sisters looked at one another , their eyes full of questions . Annie put the specially encrypted phone to her ear , murmured a greeting , and then listened to the excited voice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression went from disbelief to utter disbelief when she said , " Pearl , I have my own crisis right here on the mountain , and I ca n't get excited about what 's going on in Utah . Besides , it is n't even light out , so it has to be around three o'clock in Utah , which raises the question : What the hell are you doing out there on some back road in the middle of nowhere at this hour of the night ? I 'll get back to you when I have time . " <p> " What ? What ? " the other Sisters demanded . <p> Annie shrugged . " Like I know . I could barely understand her . Somebody 's bus broke down . Not Pearl 's . " <p> Annie 's phone rang again , then Nikki 's pealed . Yoko pulled her phone out of the pocket of her robe just as it rang . <p> " Will someone answer the damn phones already ? " Kathryn blasted . <p> Everyone started talking at once , on the phones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacing . <p> " I 'd say Pearl does have a crisis . But , I do n't see how we can help , " Nikki said . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
