Eastward from Pretzsch // In the spring of 1941 a police academy in Pretzsch , a town on the Elbe River about fifty miles southwest of Berlin , became the site of a sinister assembly . Several thousand men from the ranks of the SS-the Nazi Party 's Schutzstaffel , or defense echelon , a police and security service that answered directly to Adolf Hitler and operated outside the constraints of German law-were ordered to report to Pretzsch for training and assignment . They were not told what their assignment would be , but their commonalities offered a clue : many of them had served in SS detachments in Poland , which Germany had invaded and occupied in 1939 , and preference was given to men who spoke Russian . // Assignment to Pretzsch emptied the SS leadership school in Berlin-Charlottenburg and depleted the professional examination course of an SS criminal division . It drew in lower- and middle-ranking officers of the Security Police ( the Gestapo and the criminal police ) , some of them passed on gratefully by their home regiments because they were considered too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , contributed enlisted men . High-ranking bureaucrats within the shadowy Reich Security Main Office , * an internal SS security agency , were posted to Pretzsch as well . They had been handpicked for leadership positions by Obergruppenf ? hrer Reinhard Heydrich , the head of the RSHA and the second most powerful man in the SS , and his superior Heinrich Himmler , the Reichsf ? hrer-SS . Most of these handpicked leaders were lawyers , and a few were physicians or educators ; most had earned doctoral degrees . Among the more exotic specimens were Otto Ohlendorf , a handsome but argumentative young economist who had fallen into disfavor with Himmler ; Paul Blobel , a rawboned , highstrung , frequently drunken architect ; Arthur Nebe , a former vice squad detective and Gestapo head who had enthusiastically volunteered ; and Karl J ? ger , a brutal fifty-three-year-old secret police commander . A reserve battalion of the regular German Order Police ( uniformed urban , rural and municipal police ) completed the Pretzsch roster. // Soon the men learned that they would be assigned to an Einsatzgruppe-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army into Austria , Czechoslovakia and Poland when Germany had invaded those countries successively in 1938 and 1939 . Einsatzgruppen secured occupied territories in advance of civilian administrators . They confiscated weapons and gathered incriminating documents , tracked down and arrested people the SS considered politically unreliable-and systematically murdered the occupied country 's political , educational , religious and intellectual leadership . Since Germany had concluded a nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union in August 1939 , many of the candidates at Pretzsch assumed they would be assigned to follow the Wehrmacht into England . Some of them had previously trained to just that end . // By the spring of 1941 , Poland had already been decapitated . Albert Speer , Hitler 's architect and later his munitions and armament minister , remembered that on the night of 21 August 1939 , when news of Josef Stalin 's agreement to the nonaggression pact had settled Hitler 's decision to invade Poland , the F ? hrer and his entourage had drifted out onto the terrace of his mountain retreat on the Obersalzberg to watch a rare display of Northern Lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of G ? tterd ? mmerung could not have been more effectively staged , " Speer writes . " The same red light bathed our faces and our hands . The display produced a curiously pensive mood among us . Abruptly turning to one of his military adjutants , Hitler said : ' Looks like a great deal of blood . This time we wo n't bring it off without violence . ' " // The next day the F ? hrer belabored the generals and field marshals of the Wehrmacht for hours with an impassioned harangue . He told them Germany needed room to expand and as a buffer against the Russians . Therefore he meant not merely to occupy Poland but also to destroy it ; in its place a new German eastern frontier would arise . " The idea of treating war as anything other than the harshest means of settling questions of very existence is ridiculous , " he challenged the army commanders . " Every war costs blood , and the smell of blood arouses in man all the instincts which have lain within us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the intoxication of murder , and many other things . Everything else is empty babble . A humane war exists only in bloodless brains . " A field marshal who attended the conference reported Hitler warning them " that he would proceed against the Poles after the end of the campaign with relentless vigor . Things would happen which would not be to the taste of the German generals . " The field marshal understood the warning to mean " the destruction of the Polish intelligentsia , in particular the priesthood , by the SS. " // When Germany had attacked Poland on 1 September 1939 , beginning the Second World War in Europe , five Einsatzgruppen that Heydrich had organized followed behind the five invading Wehrmacht armies , each group subdivided into four Einsatzkommandos of 100 to 150 men . These advance cadres were augmented with Order Police battalions , Totenkopf* concentration-camp guard regiments and Waffen-SS , producing a combined SS force approaching twenty thousand men . The commander of one of the Polish Einsatzgruppen in 1939 , Bruno Streckenbach , would become the head of SS personnel responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941. // Himmler 's SS was famously thorough . Heydrich , a tall , horse-faced , sneering former naval officer whom even his own subordinates called " the blond beast , " had started his career organizing elaborate card indexes on Nazi Party enemies , a system Hitler had instituted in the early days of the party to keep tabs on his own supporters . If the Einsatzgruppen in Poland followed standard SS practice , the lists Heydrich 's staff compiled of Polish enemies would serve them well . An SS officer on a later mission to the Caucasus describes how the system worked : // As a group leader I was sent supplementary documentation . By far the most valuable was a slim little book , part of a limited , numbered edition , which I never let out of my sight . The typeface was tiny , I remember , and the paper was extra thin , in order to pack the most information into the smallest possible space . . . . It consisted of a series of lists , including the names of every active member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligentsia , and listings of scholars , teachers , writers and journalists , priests , public officials , upwardly mobile peasants , and the most prominent industrialists and bankers . It contained addresses and telephone numbers . . . . And that was n't all . There were additional listings of relatives and friends , in case any subversive scum tried to hide , plus physical descriptions , and in some cases photographs . You can imagine what the size of that book would have been if it had been printed normally . // All these categories of people in Poland , and the Polish nobility as well , were marked for murder . During the first weeks after the invasion , while the Wehrmacht still controlled the occupied areas , a historian of the Polish experience summarizes , " 531 towns and villages were burned ; the provinces of Lodz and Warsaw suffered the heaviest losses . Various branches of the army and police i.e. , Himmler 's legions carried out 714 mass executions , which took the lives of 16,376 people , most of whom were Polish Christians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the police responsible for the remainder . " The historian cites an Englishwoman 's eyewitness account of executions in the Polish town of Bydgoszcz : // The first victims of the campaign were a number of Boy Scouts , from twelve to sixteen years of age , who were set up in the marketplace against a wall and shot . No reason was given . A devoted priest who rushed to administer the Last Sacrament was shot too . He received five wounds . A Pole said afterwards that the sight of those children lying dead was the most piteous of all the horrors he saw . That week the murders continued . Thirty-four of the leading tradespeople and merchants of the town were shot , and many other leading citizens . The square was surrounded by troops with machine-guns . // Three weeks after invading Poland , the Wehrmacht washed its hands of further responsibility for the decapitation , leaving the field to the specialists of the SS . Heydrich met with Quartermaster General Eduard Wagner to agree on an SS " cleanup once and for all " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heydrich then wrote the Einsatzgruppen commanders specifically concerning the " Jewish question in the occupied territory . " Cautioning strict secrecy , he distinguished between " the ultimate aim ( which will take some time to accomplish ) , " and " interim measures ( which can be carried out within a shorter period of time ) . " In the short term , Jews living in territories in western Poland scheduled to be annexed to Germany were to be " cleared " by shipping them eastward ; Jews in the remainder of Poland were to be concentrated into ghettos in towns with good railroad connections . Heydrich 's letter did not specify what measures the " ultimate aim " would require . Long after the war , when Adolf Eichmann saw this 1939 document , he concluded that it embodied the " basic conception " of " the order concerning the physical extermination of the Jews " of the occupied territories . Large numbers of Polish Jews were murdered in any case , because they were politically suspect for reasons other than their religion ; at this early point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of bringing the Jewish population of Poland under SS control . // An incident in the town of Wloclawek during the last week of September was unusual only in its conflict between authorities . A Totenkopf unit had arrested eight hundred Jewish men . Some of them had been " auf der Flucht erschossen " - " shot while trying to escape " -a standard euphemism for extrajudicial killing in the concentration camps guarded by Totenkopf regiments . The SS unit leader had planned to arrest every Jewish male in town , but the local Wehrmacht commander had overruled him . " They will all be shot in any case , " the SS leader had countered . In his innocence the commander had responded , " The F ? hrer can hardly intend us to shoot all the Jews ! " Warsaw fell on 28 September 1939 , and the day before , Heydrich could already report that " of the Polish leadership , there remained in the occupied area at most 3 percent . " // SS brutality in Poland descended to unadorned slaughter in October , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The so-called euthanasia program was just beginning in Germany , to be directed initially against children , but the first SS killings preceded any euthanasia murders . The SS 's victims were German , removed from hospitals and nursing homes in the Prussian province of Pomerania and transported by train across the border into occupied Poland . The euthanasia program in Germany had to proceed by stealth , but occupied territory was no-man's-land , beyond German law and public scrutiny . Just as it would be easier to murder Jews in the subjugated lands east of Germany , so it was easier to murder the disabled there , including German citizens . // A large SS regiment had been resident in the Free City of Danzig before the war , commanded by SS Sturmbannf ? hrer* Kurt Eimann . Eimann recruited several thousand members of the regiment into an auxiliary police unit that bore his name . Late in October 1939 , the Pomeranian disabled were crowded into cattle cars and shipped into occupied Poland . The Eimann Battalion met the train at the railroad station in the town of Neustadt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dig killing pits to serve as mass graves . Trucks delivered the disabled to the forest . The first victim was a woman about fifty years old ; Eimann personally dispatched her with a Genickshuss , a shot in the neck from behind at the point where the spinal cord enters the skull . Historian Henry Friedlander quotes from postwar trial testimony : " In front of the pit Eimann shot the woman through the base of the skull . The woman , who had walked in front of him without suspecting anything , was instantaneously killed and fell into the pit . " During November 1939 , further victims were transported from Danzig , filling the Neustadt pits with some 3,500 bodies . To eliminate witnesses , Eimann had the political prisoners who dug the pits murdered and the pits covered with dirt . // Friedlander found that essentially all the disabled in the Polish districts annexed to the Third Reich were shot into mass graves : 1,172 psychiatric patients in Tiegenhof beginning on 7 December 1939 , for example ; 420 psychiatric patients from the hospital in Chelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonderkommando* formed of German security police from Posen and Lodz by an Einsatzgruppe leader , Herbert Lange , used moving vans fitted with tanks of pure carbon monoxide to murder patients throughout a former Polish province that was annexed to Germany as Wartheland . " After killing handicapped patients in 1940 , " Friedlander adds , " the Lange commando possibly also killed Jews in the small villages of the Wartheland with these early gas vans . " " Little by little we were taught all these things , " Eichmann would explain without apology . " We grew into them . " // A secret annex to Germany 's nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union had divided Poland between the two powers . To claim Russia 's share of the spoils , the Red Army had invaded Poland from the east on 17 September 1939 . Hitler assigned Himmler the work of expelling eastward more than eight million non-Germans from what had been western Poland and moving ethnic Germans westward out of the Soviet-occupied Baltic states to settle in their place . To launch the grandiose winnowing , Himmler ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another half million Gentile Poles . " I had to set up guidelines for implementation , " Eichmann recalled , " because those were the Reichsf ? ? hrer 's orders . For instance , he said , ' No one is to take any more with him than the Germans who were driven out by the French . ' After the First World War , he meant , from Alsace-Lorraine , or later from the Rhineland and the Ruhr . I had to find out ; at that time , fifty kilos of luggage were allowed per person . " Himmler issued his expulsion order on 30 October 1939 , setting February 1940 as a deadline . After 15 November 1939 , the entire railway network of the area of occupied Poland that the Germans had named the General Government-central and southern Poland-was reserved for resettlement transports . Trainloads of Jewish and Gentile Poles began moving east in December . The victims were dumped in the General Government in the middle of Polish winter with no provision for food or shelter . An uncounted number died of exposure or starved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the General Government , Hans Frank , formerly Hitler 's personal lawyer , to declare in a public speech , " What a pleasure , finally to be able to tackle the Jewish race physically . The more that die , the better . " Himmler himself alluded to the devastating consequences of resettlement in a speech the following autumn to one of his battalions , bragging that Poland had been the place ... // ( Continues ... ) //
