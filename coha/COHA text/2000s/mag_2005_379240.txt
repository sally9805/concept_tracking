The first thing Peter Haugen noticed was that the dents in his mom 's car were multiplying . Then the Osterville , Mass. , software engineer learned that his mother , 85 , had confused the brake and the gas pedal and ended up , unhurt , atop a stone wall . He pleaded with her to stop driving . He spoke to her doctor . He even persuaded her to see a geropsychologist . <P> Nothing worked . Like many older drivers , she clung to her license to preserve her mobility as well as her sense of independence and identity . But on July , 16 , 2003 , Haugen decided he had to do more . On that day , an 87-year-old driver made national headlines when he plowed into a Santa Monica , Calif. , farmer 's market , killing 10 people . " I told my sister , " he recalls , " ' We got ta get going on this . There but for the grace of God go we . ' " <P> Enlisting the aid of their mother 's doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister persuaded their mom to get a driving assessment at the DriveWise program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston . She failed . Mom was off the road , and  --  who knows ?  --  perhaps another fatal accident was averted . <P> Haugen 's call was one of a flood received by DriveWise director Lissa Kapust and other driving-safety centers around the country following the Santa Monica horror . For years , experts on highway safety and aging had been crying , " The boomers are coming ! The boomers are coming ! " But until Santa Monica , government and foundations had been sluggish in responding to the scary statistics . In seven years , the oldest boomers will turn 65 ; by 2030 , 1 out of 4 drivers will be 65 or older . Not all older drivers pose safety hazards , but people 75 and older have more fatal crashes than any other group except teenagers . And drivers who are cognitively impaired  --  about 25% of the 65-and-older group  --  are 7.5 times as likely as nonimpaired drivers to be at fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers . <P> After the Santa Monica accident , legislators , state departments of motor vehicles ( DMVs ) and others began putting a premium on older-driver safety . The push is occurring on several fronts : research to identify which drivers need testing , development of more accurate assessment tools , a greater focus on driver remediation and the creation of specialized licensing for the elderly . In addition , states and social-services agencies are starting or bolstering programs to support older people who have stopped driving , offering counseling and alternate transportation options . Backing up all these efforts , officials are launching public education campaigns to encourage testing of older drivers and counter their often passionate resistance to giving up driving . <P> New Hampshire and Illinois are the only states that require age-based road tests ( for those 75 and older ) . Most states are wrestling with how to identify at-risk drivers scientifically without the difficulty and expense of testing everyone past a certain age . Maryland has been at the leading edge of research to determine the age at which large-scale screening of drivers makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of the Maryland Medical Advisory Board , indicate that 75 is the age at which screening at license renewal becomes most effective .
