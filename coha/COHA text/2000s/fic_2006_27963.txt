Hotshot reporter Percy Crenshaw died on the last day of my thirty-second year . I 'm crystal clear on the timing , because I remember precisely where I was when I got word the following morning . I was slogging away in the misdemeanor intake unit , issuing criminal trespass after criminal trespass case , thinking to myself , This is a shitty way to spend my thirty-second birthday . The way I saw it , I had no business working at intake . I have been a prosecutor for seven years , three federally as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in New York City , and four in my current position as a Deputy District Attorney for Multnomah County . Only someone with a local connection would know where Multnomah County is , let alone how to pronounce it . It 's the county whose seat is Portland , Oregon , the rainy city in the Pacific Northwest . Not the big one with the needle in the skyline , the smaller one south of there . Before hearing the news about Percy , my big complaint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outsiders might not recognize the county name , but they know about these people , even if they 've never made the Oregon connection . My hometown 's protesters are the same nuts who stirred up the masses outside the World Trade Organization talks afew years ago . In a smaller local show , they tried to make a lost point about our soldier-a-day situation in the Mideast by upchucking red , white , and blue ipecac when the President showed up for a campaign stop . Some of them are rumored to be responsible for the arsons in California targeting suburban housing developments and SUV dealers . The political causes may vary , but one thing remains the same : These kids love to protest . And the night before my birthday , the chosen cause was the fatal shooting two weeks earlier of Delores Tompkins , an African-American mother of two , by a patrol officer with the Portland Police Bureau . Like all police shootings , the Tompkins case would be presented to a grand jury before any official determination was made regarding justification . Unlike most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply for appearances . Tompkins had no criminal history , was unarmed , and was shot through the windshield of her car during what should have been a routine stop . And , as often seems to be the case with these things , the police officer in question , Geoff Hamilton , was white . As the newest member of our office 's Major Crimes Unit , I was not working on the investigation into the Tompkins shooting . But even I could sense a more than theoretical possibility that our office would be going for charges against Officer Hamilton . The public must have sensed it too . With each day since Delores Tompkins 's death had come another related event -- a prayer vigil , a town meeting , a conference with the police commissioner -- each occasion an opportunity to apprise the city that its small community of color was fired up and paying attention . And as their message trickled its way each morning into a new edition of the Oregonian , the odds of an indictment reading State of Oregon v. Geoffrey Hamilton increased just a little more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure to indict had been quiet , subtle , and largely behind the scenes . All that changed when the state 's band of semiprofessional protesters selected Delores Tompkins as their cause du jour , drawing a riled-up crowd of several thousand downtown on Sunday afternoon for a hastily planned March Against Racism . Supporters of the police bureau organized a counterprotest , not because they were marching for racism but because they interpreted the anger over the Tompkins shooting as a general attack on law enforcement . When a pack of militia types from eastern Oregon announced that it would piggyback onto the counterprotest , downtown Portland became the official magnet for every disgruntled wack job in the region . At last count , the bureau had arrested 212 protesters for various counts of criminal trespass , reckless endangerment , vandalism , and disorderly conduct . Clashes among and between opposing political groups and police officers continued until 2 a.m . And , on Monday morning , extra available bodies in the District Attorney 's Office -- including mine -- had been summoned to misdemeanor intake for the overload . So that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotshot reporter Percy Crenshaw had been killed . " This is a shitty way to spend my thirty-second birthday , " I said , this time not to myself but to Jessica Walters . Jessica was the head of the District Attorney 's Gang Unit . She had just walked in , forty minutes behind me , grande mocha latte in hand , trademark pencil tucked between her pearl-studded ear and her sporty frost-tipped haircut . " Could be worse , Kincaid . I got ten years on you , it 's not even my birthday , and I 'm stuck drinking decaf because of this little fucker . " She gestured with her Starbucks cup at the swollen belly hidden beneath her black maternity pantsuit . Leave it to Jessica to find a way to drop the f-bomb as a maternal term of endearment . " I guess intake is Duncan 's idea of a reward for coming in early . " The boss of all the bosses , District Attorney Duncan Griffith , had left an office-wide voice mail for all of his deputies that morning . The gist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rule : The first deputy to arrive in each unit was to report to misdemeanor intake immediately to help , unless the lawyer had a trial scheduled to go out . It takes a lot to make me yearn for a trial , but that did the trick . Doing someone else 's work is bad enough , but this was mundane stupid busywork . Not to mention the fact that the intake unit was located in the Justice Center , two blocks from the courthouse , so in this case doing someone else 's work had started with a walk back out into the rain . " I guess the early birds really do get the worms , " I said , handing her a misdemeanor intake file . " When I got the boss 's message , I was tempted to hightail it out of the courthouse . Let someone else take the bullet . " I left Jessica with the misleading impression that my conscience had gotten the best of me . In truth , it was my paranoia , combined with my ignorance of technology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of who had logged in to voice mail and in what order . I did n't need to furnish him yet another opportunity to accuse me of not being a team player . Or , better still , to unleash my very favorite motivational phrase : " There is no ' I ' in team . " Maybe not , I say , but there is a me , and that " me " had little interest in churning out another misdemeanor complaint . Jessica Walters , on the other hand , had little sympathy . " Cut your whining . If I can pull this duty , you can suck it up for one morning . " Known in some circles as Nail-'Em-to-the-Wall Walters , Jessica was a career prosecutor , a fixture in the office for nearly twenty years . Before her promotion to supervise the Gang Unit , she 'd preceded me as the only female lawyer in the Major Crimes Unit , handling some of the toughest capital murder prosecutions in the state . She was right . It had been only six months since my promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake , I guess I was n't either . I counted another four files from the large stack we were facing , handed them to her , and then plucked out five more for myself . " Want to race to make it interesting ? Winner on each set of five cases buys a drink ? " " Rub it in , Kincaid . You have no idea how much I miss my amber ales . " She looked down again at the contents of her maternity suit . " Sorry , " I said sheepishly . " Starbucks ? " " You 're on , " she said , opening the first folder . Jessica and I each issued fifteen separate cases in the next fifty-six minutes . I won two prosecutorial sprints of the three . A quick read of the police report , a few taps on the ten-key pad for the badge numbers of the arresting officers , and a few more strokes for the applicable sections of the criminal code , and -- voil ! out popped a criminal complaint . If the pace seems callous , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to issuing custodies . These are the cases filed against suspects who were booked the previous night . If a custody case is n't ready for arraignment by the time the suspect is called on the 2 p.m. docket , the court cuts the suspect loose . Free lattes were n't our only motivation for rushing . As eight-thirty was rolling around and the rest of the office was finally strolling in , a young woman I recognized as the intake unit 's receptionist interrupted our case-issuing sprints . " You 're Kincaid , right ? " she asked . I nodded , scrawling my illegible signature at the bottom of yet another complaint . " You 've got a call from an officer . I 'll transfer it back , " she said . " Who is it ? " I asked . " Who pays attention ? They asked for you , though . " " Thanks a bunch , " I muttered , under my breath . I could n't figure out who would be calling me at intake , but for the moment it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few minutes . I picked up the transferred call . " Kincaid . " " Good morning , Ms. Kincaid . It 's Jack Walker . " Otherwise known as one of my favorite Major Crimes Team detectives . " So my sources were right . You 've worked your way all the way up into the glorious misdemeanor unit . " " Rumor 's out already , huh ? You calling to gloat ? " " I 'm busting you out of there . We got a body up in Hillside . I 'm told you 're our gal . " " Yeah ? By whom ? " " That 'd be one Senior Deputy District Attorney Russell Frist . " He enunciated my supervisor 's name in the deep booming staccato voice used widely in law enforcement circles to mimic Russ Frist . Apparently Russ had decided this call-out would be mine . " You need me to come up there ? " I asked . " Definitely , " he said . " This one 's gon na be a doozy . " As my Jetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had helpfully described as " the parking lot of those big pink condos , " I considered the scenarios possibly awaiting me at the top of the hill -- none of them good . Protocol requires the bureau to connect with our office immediately on every new homicide , just to be sure a DA works the case from the start . But most cases do n't warrant the physical presence of a prosecutor at the crime scene . What made this one so special ? When I turned into the parking lot of sprawling Vista Heights , I silently cursed Jack Walker . There must have been eight hundred condos perched on the overlook above northwest Portland , surrounded by acres of parking lot . I cruised the main road surrounding the complex -- as well as its various offshoots -- at a steady five miles per hour , thanks to the frequent and enormous speed bumps spread throughout the property . I finally knew I 'd reached the right place at the dead end of one of the side roads when I spotted a flurry of cop activity behind the familiar yellow crime-scene tape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climbed out of the car , cinching my raincoat more tightly around me . It was the first week in November , and the autumn dampness had already begun to settle into the air and into my bones . As I walked across the parking lot , I noticed neighbors peering from behind their blinds at the obvious bustle . A few had stepped outside their condos , some still in robes and holding coffee cups , trying to ascertain what could have brought so many uniforms and marked vehicles to this quiet enclave . The learning curve in the Major Crimes Unit had been a steep one , and by now I knew the ropes on a call-out . I showed my badge to the officer monitoring access at the scene , watched as he logged my entry onto his clipboard , and then ducked beneath the tape that roped off about a quarter acre surrounding an open carport . Jack Walker caught sight of me in his periphery and waved me over . He stood with his partner , Detective Raymond Johnson , in front of a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in a lot stocked with late-model yuppie-mobiles , that one stood out . As I approached , I saw two crime-scene technicians rise from where they must have been kneeling next to the front driver's-side tire . A blur of crisp white linen flashed between them ; then they carefully maneuvered a covered gurney through the tight corner in front of the vehicle . I nodded as they passed on their way to the medical examiner 's van . Johnson and Walker met me just outside the carport . Some of the other detectives referred to the pair as Ebony and Ivory . Even beyond the obvious contrast in melanin , the two could n't have been more divergent physically . Walker was n't much taller than my five-eight , but about twice as wide , testing the buttons of dress shirts that were almost universally short-sleeved . Johnson 's frame , on the other hand , was tall , fit , and always tucked neatly into whatever suit he 'd brought home that month from the Saks men 's store . Regardless , the partners were two peas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone but each other . " So who 's our dead guy ? " I asked , glancing back at the techs loading the gurney into the van . The MCU culture required a kind of nonchalance toward death -- or at least the appearance of it . The two detectives exchanged a glance . Using whatever silent language partners tend to share , they must have decided to let Johnson break the news . " The one and only Percy Crenshaw . " " The reporter ? " I asked incredulously . " Did n't I just say he was the one and only ? " Johnson retorted . I shook my head . " This is not good . " " Try telling that to Crenshaw , " Walker said dryly . Percy Crenshaw started out doing " on your side " pieces for the Oregonian 's Metro section . If a restaurant fed you bad meat , or your used car oozed mystery melt , or your new hairdresser surprised you with a blue mohawk , Percy Crenshaw was the go-to guy . More recently , though , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muckraker in this relatively quiet little city . Of course , like all good muckrakers , he had done that by turning what usually would have been relatively quiet stories into salacious tales of sex , greed , and corruption . Last year , just for instance , I had worked on a case involving the murder of an administrative law judge . Sure , it had all the ingredients of a good scandal : bribery , betrayal , adultery , the works . At its heart , though , it was the sad story of a woman whose own mistakes had gotten her killed . Crenshaw had nonetheless managed to sell his version of the story , including every last irrelevant detail of the victim 's sex life , to L.A. Magazine . " That 's some damn shameful timing , " Johnson said . " The man was right about to hit it big . " " Did n't he just sell the movie rights to that magazine article ? " Walker asked . " Yeah , he did , " Johnson said . " Got a nice chunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those legal thrillers . " His partner did n't read the entertainment section as thoroughly as I did . Walker wanted to know if she was the same actress who " gained all that weight for that one role . " Nope , they just looked alike . I guess that 's the way the entertainment industry works . The victim dies , her family loses a daughter and sister , and I nearly get killed . But who sells the story and drives an S-Class Benz ? Percy Crenshaw . " I actually met him once , " Johnson said . " I hope you were n't the target of a story he was after , " I said . " From what I 've heard , the guy left no stone unturned . " " Understatement of the century , " Walker added . " More like he 'd crawl over his dying mother to get to the last stone left unturned . " " Nah , nothing like that , " Johnson said . " We had a real quick ' Hello , how are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys and Girls Club thing . There 's not too many brothers in this white-bread town with real jobs . Once you find yourself on the list of people to call for mentoring panels and whatnot , it 's probably inevitable that you end up meeting Percy . " Fewer than 7 percent of Portland 's half a million residents are African-Americans . Take into account the predictable decision of the upwardly mobile to live with similarly situated others , and you do n't find many black professionals who move to or stick around the Pacific Northwest . " So what was he like ? " I asked . Johnson 's eyes darted briefly to the ME van , the doors now closed . He paused , then shook his head . " Not what you 'd expect , " he said . " You know , none of the ' tude he puts on in his interviews . Pretty down-to-earth . He talked to the kids about being one of the few black journalism majors at U of O. They were more interested in his work digging up the dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he told them he 'd thought of being a cop but wanted the freedom to do what was right . " " I know the guy 's dead , " Walker said , " but fuck that noise . " " No , he was all right . You get stopped a hundred times for being in a nice car , and you eventually develop a chip . Imagine what he would have written today about the protests . I feel bad for Hamilton , " he said , referring to the cop who shot Delores Tompkins , " but if this shit keeps up , the city 's going to burn . " I could tell that Walker was poised for rebuttal , so I brought us back to the subject at hand . " Any theories yet on who might have had a chip against him ? " They shook their heads . " Way too soon to say , " Johnson said . " I suppose there 's always the chance he finally ticked off the wrong kind of nut job --  " " Well , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six o'clock news , " I interjected . " Of course I know that , " he acknowledged , " but I also know what you 've been around long enough to know too : By the end of the day , we 're probably going to learn that Percy Crenshaw had something kinky going on behind the public persona . " You 've seen it before in high-profile murder cases . Early speculation about a motive usually gives way to a dirty little secret , lingering somewhere in the victim 's life : shady business deals , a tryst with someone else 's wife , a hidden life in Internet chat rooms -- something to put the case squarely in the " comfort zone " of murder , where people toeing the straight-and-narrow are safely off limits . " Unless , " I wondered aloud , " it 's a carjacking gone wrong ? " " A definite possibility , " Johnson said . " The guy who found the body says he noticed a couple of guys in the parking lot last night . He did n't think much of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carjacking angle . " " I do n't suppose he recognized them . " Johnson smiled , familiar with my impatient tendency to hope for early lucky breaks . " Nope . Two white guys in jeans and rain gear . He thinks he might recognize them , though , so we 'll sit him down at the station with some mug shots . The poor guy 's kicking himself , feeling guilty as shit . " " For what ? " " He 's the superintendent for the whole complex . " He checked his notebook . " Peter Anderson . He found the body in the carport when he went to replace the motion-activated light that 's supposed to be there . Percy put in a maintenance request for the burnt-out bulb a week ago , and Anderson was running behind . I did n't have the heart to tell him he 'll be lucky to avoid a lawsuit . " A holler from across the parking lot interrupted us . " Detectives , when you got a sec , we got something you might be interested in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go "  - -  and started a slow jog toward the patrol officer . " Anyway , " Walker continued , " we 're keeping the carjack scenario as a possibility , but usually they take the car , plan gone wrong or not . We found the keys right there . " He pointed to a numbered evidence placard marking a spot by the driver 's side door . " Crenshaw probably dropped them during the attack . " I looked more closely then at the area surrounding the Benz . Low spatters of crimson marred the barren white Sheetrock of the carport . A wet stain that might otherwise be mistaken for oil spread beneath the front tire like a Rorschach test . I suspected that the matte smear down the side of the car 's waxed front panel was also blood . I turned back to Walker . " Was he shot ? " He shook his head . " Does n't look like it . He was beaten real bad . Unclear whether the technical cause of death 's going to be the internal bleeding or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing there was a weapon involved . Maybe a bat or a crowbar . " I swallowed , relieved that I had n't arrived a few minutes earlier , before the gurney was covered . " So what are you working on ? " " We 've got patrol officers canvassing the complex in case a neighbor saw something . Doubtful , though . In a place like this , someone would have called it in . " " Did you notify the family ? " " Not yet . We 're working on that as a priority . We 've got the place closed off , but it wo n't be easy keeping this quiet . I assume everyone in the complex knows whose car that is , and it 's pretty obvious what 's going on here . " " He 's single , right ? " " Yeah . Ray put a call in to the Oregonian for next-of-kin information . Hopefully his family 'll hear it from us before it hits the news . " " Have you gone into his place yet ? " " Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're getting a warrant . Should be easy . " " Who 's working on the applications ? " I asked . Judges routinely sign warrants for a homicide victim 's home and office , so the paperwork was straightforward . " Mike and Chuck are taking care of it now , back at the office . They 'll page you when they 're ready for you to look at it . " Detectives Mike Calabrese and Chuck Forbes were partners , also in the Major Crimes Team . I 'd seen the latter just three hours ago when he rolled out of my bed , pulled on his clothes , and kissed me goodbye . In addition to his position in the bureau , Detective Forbes also filled the role of my current boyfriend . And , technically , I suppose he rolled out of " our " bed , because as of a week ago we were officially shacked up . " Any legal work you need me to do ? " " Not yet . " He squinted at me , anticipating what was coming . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said bluntly . " I called Frist as part of the usual procedure , but I told him we did n't need anyone at the crime scene . " " And he said ? " " Something along the lines of "  - -  Walker channeled his best Frist --  " ' Uh , that 's fine , Detective Walker , but , you know , the news 'll be all over this one . Why do n't I go ahead and ask you to get Kincaid out there ; it 'll be easier down the road if something comes up . ' " " Your impersonation 's better than ever . " " I 'm pleased that you 're pleased . Now , as for why he dimed you up instead of someone else in the unit , I can only guess . " " And your best guess ? " " Honestly ? To see how you 'll cut it . You 've got to admit , the one other time you got handed a hot potato , your approach was n't exactly traditional . " He was referring , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time that one played out , I had leaked information to a defense attorney and helped him subpoena some of the biggest muckety-mucks in the county . Yes , I suppose Walker was correct : My boss wanted to put me to the test . Ray Johnson walked back to the carport with his black leather steno pad open in front of him , Montblanc pen in hand . " They find a neighbor ? " I asked . " Looks like we 've got a possible girlfriend . " That got Walker 's attention . " I thought the guy at the paper told you there was no girlfriend . " " So maybe Percy did n't tell the guys at work everything . A couple nights ago , one of the neighbors came home late to find a car parked in her designated spot . She got ticked and took down the plate so she could complain the next day . Later on , she saw Percy walk the lady to her car . He gave the neighbor the mandatory apologetic wave , so she let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . " " Good , " I said . " Run it and find out her story . Anything else ? " " That 's it from the patrol so far , but Chuck just called . He and Mike are working last night 's PPDS entries from the area . " The Portland Police Data System is the clearinghouse for every piece of information collected by the bureau . Generating a list of arrests , stops , and traffic tickets in a given location during a stated time range was a snap . " Anything worth following up on ? " I asked . Johnson glanced at his notes . " Yeah , maybe . They 're still culling through the full list , but there 's a couple that jumped to the top . A broken taillight on a two-time car thief down on Twenty-third Avenue . A stop-and-talk with some kid at the bottom of the hill ; we still need to get the details from the patrol officer . " He flipped a page of his notebook . " Another stop farther up Burnside ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " He closed his notebook and switched gears . " Also , I finally got through to the human resources chick at the Oregonian . Crenshaw 's local emergency contact is just a friend . Closest family 's his parents down in Cali . " " I 'll do this one , " Walker said quietly . Johnson tucked in his lower lip and nodded . I knew how much they hated notifying the families . " Oh , before I forget , " he said , pointing at me , " when I talked to Chuck , he and Mike were just finishing the warrant applications . " It was time for me to head down to MCT . Continues ...
