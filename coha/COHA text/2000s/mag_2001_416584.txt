It was late in the summer of 1999 when Robin and I started planning our big trip to Belize . We have been friends for yearsever since we were students at Florida State University . But after graduation , Robin moved to Charlotte , North Carolina , and I stayed in Jacksonville , Florida , so we did n't get to see each other nearly often enough . We had traveled to Cancun together a few years earlier , but now that we were a little older , we were looking for something more relaxing and less of a party spot . We had no inkling of the nightmare that Belize had in store for us . Blue Water and Bonefish Robin and I both love water sports  --  she 'd been learning how to fly fish , and I was getting certified in scuba diving-and we heard that Ambergris Cay in Belize , a small country on the eastern coast of Central America , was a great place to do both . Because we 'd be going on our own-my boyfriend , Todd , had to work-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . There was no mention of any problems . Reassured , I tracked down a few nice-looking hotels on Ambergris and asked Robin to make the final choice . She picked Captain Morgan 's Retreat , a secluded resort right on the beach that would later be the setting for the reality show Temptation Island . On May 20 , 2000 , we took off from Miami , Florida , to Belize City and from there took a small propeller plane to Ambergris Cay The activities director from Captain Morgan 's , Blanca , picked us up at the airport . Ambergris Cay is technically an island split in half by a lagoon , so you have to travel everywhere by boat . Blanca escorted us to a water taxi , which ferried us to our hotel at the end of the cay . The scenery was just beautiful-palm trees and blue water everywhere . After we checked in , Blanca invited us to go into the town of San Pedro that night with some other guests and hotel employees , and we said we 'd love to . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main building , lounged for a while in the beachside hammocks outside our front door , and in midafternoon , exhausted from all the travel , fell fast asleep on our beds with the door wide open . We did n't wake up until around 9 P.M. , and because we had to get up early for a fishing trip the next day , we walked to the hotel restaurant where we told Blanca , who was sitting at the bar with some guys , that we were too tired to go into town . Since there were no alarm clocks or phones in our bungalow , Blanca promised to wake us up in the morning . We spent all of the next day on the water catching fish and did n't see or talk to anyone other than Blanca and our guide , Wilbur . That night , we decided to go into town by ourselves for dinner . We left around 7:30 P.M. , and by 9:15 , we were headed back to Captain Morgan 's . We had another early excursion planned-scuba diving-so by 10:30 , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day before with the doors wide open , I asked Robin if she bad pushed in the locks on our doors . She said yes . Intruders in Our Bedroom The next thing I remember was my head hurting . Then I tried to take a breath and realized that I could not-because I was turned over on my stomach and someone was holding my face down against my pillow . I also was being hit on my head with something hard . I knew that two people must have been holding me down-one on my back , hitting me , and the other holding my legs and one arm and groping me in my boxers . Once I realized that I was being sexually molested , I freaked out . I managed to flip myself over , and I must have caught my attackers off guard because I was able to wriggle free . One guy dropped what he had been hitting me with-a hard , green coconut , the kind that were lying all over the beach-and ran out the back door . The other guy stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump on me again , but instead , be said either You should n't have gone into town " or " You should have gone into town . " Then he also ran out the back door . I could tell from their Spanish accents that the men were young locals . Photograph Best friend Amy , left , and Robin in happier times Photograph // I ran out the front door screaming and immediately spotted a security guard not 20 feet away from our bungalow . I thought it was strange-he was close enough to our cabana to have heard what was going on . " Two men attacked us ! They ran out the back door ! " I yelled . He ran over to the cabana and started checking things out and speaking into his walkie-talkie . That 's when I went over to Robin 's bed and saw my best friend lying there with blood coming out of her nose and her ears . The two men had beaten her unconscious , literally bashing her skull , before they had started on me . I thought Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but nothing happened . Finally , Robin fluttered her eyes and moved a little bit . I said , " Robin , Robin , are you okay ? " and she whispered , " Where am I , what day is it ? " The attack had occurred soon after we went to sleep , so plenty of hotel workers were still on the grounds and about 10 of them had gathered in our room , including the hotel director , Ernest Olmstead . I was screaming for people to get out , screaming for someone to call the police , unsure whether anyone even understood me . Then Robin became nauseous and upset because she could n't remember anything and did n't know where she was . I yelled to anyone who would listen , " We have to get her to a hospital ! " But as I soon discovered , there is no hospital on Ambergris Cay , only atiny , rundown clinic in San Pedro , and no ambulance to get there . A hotel worker carried Robin down to the dock and onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy in a golf cart to give us a ride to the clinic . Robin was crying and vomiting and very confused  --  it took her a while to figure out who I was . I was stern with her . " Robin , " I said , " you need to calm down . If you get too upset , you might hurt yourself more . " I knew that her head injury was serious-she was spitting blood-and I was worried that she might have a seizure . No Way Out At about midnight , we arrived at the clinic , where doctor Jose Perera was waiting for us . Dr. Perera gave Robin a shot to try to relieve the swelling , but since the clinic lacked more sophisticated equipment , he said that she should get to a hospital back in the United States ; he was worried about hemorrhaging . " How are we going to get out of here ? " I screamed . Ernest , who had come with us to the clinic , said he would pay for an air ambulance to come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother in Jacksonville , then called my father in Saint Louis , who called the U.S. Embassy in Belize , which sent a volunteer warden on Ambergris Cay , Wil Lala , over to the clinic . Ernest and two hotel workers went back to Captain Morgan 's to get our things and Robin 's health-insurance information to give to the air-ambulance company , which also wanted $20,000 before it would dispatch a jet from Houston . When Ernest came back from the hotel , he announced that he was n't going to pay for the air ambulance after all . " It 's not our responsibility , " he said . " Then get the hell out of here ! " I shouted . I called back Robin 's mother , who arranged to pay the expense . But we still had to get to Belize City , and we would not be able to fly out of Ambergris Cay until the next morning . At about 2 A.M. , everyone left the clinic except me , Robin , Dr. Perera , and Wil . Robin was wavering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile a minute , too frantic to notice that I had a huge bump on my head . Dr. Perera gave me an ice pack and said I had a bad concussion and should lie down for a little while . But a few minutes later , a local policewoman came in to make a report . She seemed weirdly angry and did n't even ask me for a description of the attackers . After she left , I began talking to Dr. Perera about why we had been attacked . " I do n't think they were there to steal , " I said , because nothing was missing . " No , " he agreed . " I think theywere there to rape you . " I was still in too much of a daze to react to that horrific probability . At 7:30 the next morning , in a small plane provided by the humanitarian aid organization Wings of Hope , we took off for Belize City . Robin lay on a stretcher , a paramedic at her side monitoring her vital signs . Her skull had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brain bruised . It was n't until they got Robin hooked up to an IV on the air ambulance that I felt a little more comfortable . A Still-Unsolved Mystery In Miami , an ambulance picked us up at the airport and took us to the hospital . My sister Lora , who lives in Tampa , was there , and when she gave me a hug , I burst into tears . I was utterly exhausted , both physically and emotionally . Robin was immediately taken to the emergency room ; I waited another hour or so to be seen by a doctor . Robin 's parents arrived , and so did my boyfriend , Todd . We had only been going out for six months , and I had no idea how he would deal with the fact that I had been groped and attacked , but he never left my side while I was in the hospital . I was released that night and went back to Jacksonville the next day Robin stayed in Miami , where she had surgery to repair the fractures in her skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I finally got to talk to her , she said , " Thank you , I know that I could be dead if it was n't for you . " After two weeks , she was released from the hospital and went home to stay with her parents in Jacksonville . That night , I went over to see her . I had to tell her everything that had happened , since she has little memory of the attack . Her doctors initially said that she would be able to go back to work in about a month , but the recovery has taken much longer . Her short-term memory is impaired , and her cognitive and verbal skills are also diminished-for example , she ca n't always find the word she 's looking for . She gets tired very easily and has trouble concentrating . She 's going to rehab therapy and is making a lot of progress , but her doctors say she may never completely recover . A few weeks after we got back , I received a letter from Ernest Olmstead , who apologized for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've never heard a word about what exactly was being done to find our assailants , and the police do n't seem to care-they did n't even bother to contact Robin to interview her . Several times , we requested a police report through the American consul in Belize City . After a year , we finally received it , but the report says only that the case has been closed and no one was arrested . I believe that whoever attacked us either worked at the hotel or knew someone who did and specifically targeted us . Even though I do n't know for sure what he was trying to say , the attacker 's comment indicates that he was aware of our movements . I went back to work , but I had flashbacks of the attack almost every night and was scared to be alone . My dad recommended that I go into therapy . I did , and it has helped my symptoms . Then one night in January , Robin called , crying hysterically . The premiere of Temptation Island was on , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at Captain Morgan 's . The cast and crew had arrived several months after we had been attacked . I could only watch for about a minute ; it was just too upsetting to think that millions of television viewers would now think it was such a wonderful , beautiful place . Since Temptation Island , tourism to Belize has skyrocketed , and Captain Morgan 's had such a flood of reservations that the resort had to hire an additional booking agent . Todd and I have now been going out for a year and a half . I still feel very vulnerable and wo n't walk my dog alone at night . But I think that what makes me saddest is knowing that Robin and I will never travel by ourselves again . Our trips used to be the one time each year we got to catch up and spend time together , and now that 's over . In fact , my whole concept of being on vacation has changed . In October , Todd took me to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico , and I sometimes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants and wait until I came out . I had been careful in the past , but now I take extra precautions . I 've learned that even ifa place appears beautiful and safe-idyllic enough to be the setting for a TV show  --  you can never be sure . " It Could 've Been Me ! " " My friend and I were exploring in Jamaica and decided to check out a secluded town in the countryside . But we started to get a bad feeling walking down the main road-drivers kept stopping their cars to stare at us-so we retreated to a nearby hotel . That night , we learned that a Norwegian couple had been attacked in the exact spot where we had been . " " While backpacking in Nepal , I decided to take a rafting tour . My tour-guide choices boiled down to two companies-one that was more expensive and straight , the other with a rep for being easy  --  going and fun . I had a gut feeling that I should go with the first . Later , I heard that a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught on a rock and the inexperienced guides did n't have a knife to cut her free . " " I was in Los Angeles on business when a superhot guy I met offered to take me on a boat ride . I was tempted , but something told me to say no . Later on , I changed my mind . He had mentioned that he was staying at a certain hotel , but when I called information , I found out there was no such hotel . " <p>
