Summer vacation was here at last ! Kids streamed out of classrooms and into the hall . I caught a glimpse of my new neighbor , Chelsea Parks , in the hall up ahead and squeezed my way through the crowd until I caught up with her . " Hi , Chelsea ! " I said . " Why are you in such a hurry ? " She flipped her hair over her shoulder . " My family 's leaving on a trip to Hawaii first thing tomorrow morning . I 've got to finish packing . " My mouth dropped open . " Wow ! You must be really excited . " " I am , " she said . " How about you , Jason ? What are you going to do this summer ? " I grinned . " I 'm going to enter the Silver Lake Bass-Fishing Contest . " " Oh . Well , that should be fun for you , " she said . I knew she was just being polite . She probably thought fishing was dumb . My other friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and football . I did n't care . I loved fishing . And I wanted to win the gold cup more than anything in the world . I 'd been entering the contest ever since I was six , and because I had just turned twelve , this would be my last chance to win . I was determined to take home the gold cup this year . The next morning , the sun was peeking over the treetops as I carried my fishing pole and tackle box to the lake behind my house . At first , I thought the beach was empty . But then I noticed Chelsea walking along the shore , kicking up splashes of water with her bare feet . I dropped my gear and ran to meet her . " Hey , I thought you were leaving for Hawaii this morning , " I said . When she looked up , I could tell she 'd been crying . " My dad had an emergency at work , " Chelsea said . " Gosh , that 's too bad , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at her feet . " Maybe . But now I do n't have anything to do for the next few weeks . " " I know what you can do ! " I said . " You can enter the bass-fishing contest with me . " She shook her head . " No , thanks . I do n't know anything about fishing . I 'm no good at things like that . " " I can teach you , " I said . " We 've got two weeks before the contest . Come on ! " I coaxed . " It 'll be fun . " " Well , OK , " she said . " If you 'll help me . " I knew Chelsea did n't have a chance of winning . But learning to fish would keep her busy for a while . And maybe being around all the people and the excitement at the contest would cheer her up . I showed her how to use a reel and how to bait her line with a lure . " Now watch how I cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked to make sure nothing was behind me . Then I flipped my wrist and threw out my line . When the line hit the water , I slowly reeled it in . " You see ? " I said . " It 's easy . Now you try it . Chelsea had a hard time getting the hang of it . Her line kept getting caught in the weeds or tangled in a knot . But she did n't give up . And I could tell she liked it . After that , I brought an extra pole for Chelsea . We practiced every day for two weeks . And even though Chelsea tried awfully hard , she still was n't very good at casting . " Do n't worry , " I said . " You do n't have to be an expert . Just get your line into the water , and the fish will do the rest . " On the day of the contest , my dad and I picked up Chelsea and drove to Silver Lake . My heart was racing as we grabbed our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Chelsea and I stood side by side along the railing . When the whistle blew for the contest to start , we cast our lines into the water . Chelsea 's cast was n't very good . Her line went just a few feet out and quickly drifted underneath the platform we were standing on . I did n't say anything . I did n't want to make her feel bad . At first , nobody caught anything but little , tiny bass . Then a tall , red-headed boy brought in a four-pounder . It was a nice fish , but I was n't about to give up . I knew that there were bigger bass than that one in the lake . A few minutes later , I felt a tug on my line . I yanked my pole to set the hook and quickly reeled in the line . The fish was a big one ! I held my breath as the judges weighed it . My bass weighed nearly seven pounds ! " Oh , Jason , that 's wonderful ! " Chelsea said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to win . " " I hope you 're right , " I said as I slipped the fish into the cooler by the weighing stand . Time was running out , and the other con- ! testants were n't having much luck . Chelsea : had n't had a nibble all morning , yet she never complained . She was really a good sport . There were only fifteen minutes left in the contest when I noticed a sharp jerk on Chelsea 's line . " Did you get one ? " I said excitedly . Her pole was bent nearly in half . " I think it 's caught on something , " she said ; tugging at the line . " No , I think it 's a fish ! " I said . " Bring it in easy . " She slowly reeled in her line , but then the fish leapt from the water , twisting and flipping to free itself . " Do n't let it get away , Chelsea ! " I said . " Tighten your line a little . Easy ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to tire and Chelsea reeled it in . She had a hard time getting the fish out of the water , but the rules said I could n't help her . When she finally lifted it over the railing , the crowd gasped . The bass was huge ! It looked like a twelvepounder ! Chelsea had brought in the biggest bass ever caught at Silver Lake ! She was the winner . As I stared at the fish flopping on the pier , my stomach tightened into a knot . For years , I had dreamed of catching a giant bass like that one and winning the gold cup . This year had been my last chance , and Chelsea had taken it away from me . For an instant , I wanted to walk away and never speak to her again . But then I watched her face as the judges weighed her fish and slipped it into the cooler . Her eyes were dancing , and her smile was brighter than the sun . I did n't know why , at first , but I found myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chelsea . She was laughing and talking and shaking hands with everyone . And then I realized that I was just as happy as she was . Chelsea deserved the gold cup . She was a good sport , and she beat me fair and square . There 'd be other contests and other prizes . But I would n't find many friends as nice as Chelsea . After a few minutes , the crowd broke up , and Chelsea walked over to meet me , her face looking serious . " I wish both of us could have won , Jason , " Chelsea said . " I did n't mean to beat you . It was just an accident . But I ca n't help being happy . And I owe it all to you . " " No , " I said with a grin . " You owe it to that big bass you caught . " <p>
