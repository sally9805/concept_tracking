Many think the way earnings are reported is deeply flawed . What 's an investor to do ? // WE DO N'T KNOW whether the U.S. equity market is under valued , " explains Morgan Stanley strategist Barton Biggs , " because we do n't know the true earnings of the S &P."; * That 's quite an admission for the senior investing honcho at one of the world 's most prominent financial firms . But even after hundreds of CEOs personally certified the accuracy of their companies ' numbers this summer following a Securities and Exchange Commission edict , investors remain skittish about what they can trust . And with good reason . The shower of accounting scandals and earnings restatements we 've endured has made us skeptical of the financial reporting rules that were supposed to protect us and has raised a host of unsettling questions . Is the way companies are required to report their earnings fundamentally flawed ? Is there a better way to evaluate a company 's financial condition ? What can I do now ? * Aiming to address those questions below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , focusing on the three most hotly contested accounting issues . Then we turn to proposals that have been offered to improve the reliability of corporate income statements . And finally , we give practical advice about how you can intelligently incorporate quar terly earnings numbers , even with their significant limitations , in your investment research now . The problems with earnings Earnings are not simply what 's left in the kitty after the company pays all its bills . The earnings-per-share ( EPS ) number at the bottom of every company 's income statement is actually a product of enormously complicated rules called generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) . And these rules , as we now know all too well , require so much subjective judgment that they can be easily manipulated . The rules , for example , allow a company to count gains from pension fund investments as earnings , even though such gains have nothing to do with the profitability of its main line of business . What 's more ; pension income is booked based on an expected long  --  term rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as expected return estimates have gotten more optimistic ( oil giant Conoco 's expected return is now 9.25% , up from 7% in 1999 ) , pension gains ' contributions to earnings have grown more significant . Removing pension income would have lopped 6.1% off the combined earnings of the 500 companies in the S &P; 500-stock index , according to Merrill Lynch . For some companies , the impact is much greater : Verizon last year was profitable only because of $2.7 billion in pension gains . Some companies can similarly tweak earnings thanks to so-called mark-to  --  market rules that allow firms to estimate the fair value of securities , certain contracts and other assets at the end of each quarter , and count any increases in value as earnings . Accounting rules allow tremendous flexibility in deciding those valuations , which led to major abuses in the energy industry recently Aggressive mark-to-market valuations at Enron are believed to have accounted for more than half of its originally reported pretax profits in 2000 . In addition to concerns that accounting loopholes inflate corporate income , investors fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Investors like Warren Buffett believe that options are measurable employee compensation that should be included as an expense in earnings calculations . Opponents , such as Intel co-founder Andy Grove , argue that option costs are already accounted for in earnings because the exercise of options increases the number of outstanding shares used to calculate the EPS number , and that options therefore cost shareholders when , and only when , they actually get exercised . One thing that 's not in dispute : Expensing options would take a big bite out of earnings . If options were expensed using what 's known as the BlackScholes valuation model , the S &P; 500 's 2001 EPS would have been about 20% lower than reported , according to Bear Stearns . For 20 index members , including Schwab , Merrill Lynch and Disney , expensing options would have made the difference between a profitable 2001 and a money-losing year . What is to be done It 's too early to tell whether debates over stock options and the like will force changes in accounting rules . What probably will-and should-happen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their numbers . That 's the goal of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) , the governing panel empowered by the SEC to set GAAP standards . Under chairman Bob Herz , FASB has embarked on a redo of income statements so that they disclose more specifically whether earnings come from operations or from nonbusiness items like pension gains . " Investors can then look at the statement and say some of these components are more sustainable and predictable than others , " he says . Unfortunately , this makeover wo n't be complete until 2004 , but Herz promises it will be significant . Meanwhile , the analysts at Standard &; Poor 's say that investors should n't wait for rule changes but should adopt a new measure of corporate earnings that they have developed called core earnings . Core earnings attempts to strip out all the non-operating items from earnings , leaving only profits from a company 's ongoing primary business units . " Increasingly , companies would pretty much write their own accounting rules when they put together their earnings releases , " says David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to ourselves , let 's figure out how to do this the right way so the earnings number really tells us something about what 's going on and the number is consistent from company to company . " S &P; analysts have begun using core earnings in their research reports , and by the end of the year , financial data banks such as FactSet will show core earnings as well as GAAP earnings . The rating agency hopes that publicly traded companies will adopt core earnings as a new standard , reporting and discussing core earnings in their quarterly press releases . ( So far , only two companies , insurers MBIA and Ambac Financial Group , have done so . ) Skeptics are concerned that such extra-regulatory efforts to redefine earnings will only create more confusion . " Sure there are some things that need correcting , " says Chuck Hill , research director for First Call , which publishes analysts ' consensus earnings estimates . " But the basic way we 've been calculating earnings is still valid . " One of the problems Hill has with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disclose option information in their filings only annually , analysts will have to estimate options costs quarterly , creating quarterly core earnings that may be months out of date . " Earnings are just too complex to fit them into nice , neat little boxes , " he says . Responds Blitzer : " We 'll do the best we can with the data we have and do our damnedest to make sure people understand the numbers . " The uncertainty surrounding the methods of tallying earnings reinforces what may be the most important lesson to emerge from this debate : earnings per share has never been the magic number many investors believed . Oakmark fund manager Bill Nygren says that in the wild , waning years of the bull market , investors became too fixated on EPS as the be-all tool for analyzing stocks . " This idea , that if we keep tweaking the EPS number we can get down to one summary statistic we need to estimate the value of the business , is a quest for something that has n't existed and will never exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance sheet , statement of cash flows and income statement , he says , can investors get a complete picture of a company . What you can do Of course , investors should read a company 's full financials . But for better or worse , EPS remains a basic metric for assessing and comparing companies . So what 's an investor to do ? Watch closely for signs that earnings are being propped up by financial engineering . The best way to do that is to compare the cash-flow statement with the income statement . Operating cash flows can provide a truer picture of performance than earnings , since they measure the cold , hard cash that comes in and goes out of the company register . The cash-flow statement strips out noncash charges like depreciation and does n't record items like pension income . " The best companies are able to realize earnings in cash , not through calculations that belong in fantasyland , " says Harvard Business School professor David Hawkins . He suggests calculating what he calls the cash-realization ratio , which shows how much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , divide cash flow from operations ( from the cash-flow statement ) by net income ( from the income statement ) , preferably for three years , and then average the results . The companies with the highest  --  quality earnings ( see the box at left ) had a three-year average cash-realization ratio of 4.2 , according to Hawkins ' study . Companies should have average ratios of at least 1 , Hawkins says . At Intel , a top performer with a 3.2 ratio , operating cash flow has topped net income in each of the past three years , with 2001 cash flow of $8.6 billion towering over net income of $1.3 billion . Hawkins cautions that cash flow is n't foolproof either , and that relying on it certainly wo n't protect you from fraud . Capitalizing expenses improperly as assets , as WorldCom did to the tune of $3.8 billion , can inflate operating cash flow by moving the expense into a different section of the cash-flow statement . " We 're not naive , " Hawkins says . " This stuff can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings are considerably easier to monkey with than cash .
