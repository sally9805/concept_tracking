Prologue From Glorious Appearing Rayford tried to stay with Chaim . The men had left the Rosenzweig home without breakfast and without a word , as if they all somehow knew where they must go . Rayford decided that whatever was to come , he wanted to be close enough to Chaim to ask questions . The others must have had the same idea , as they all stuck together despite the crowds . " When you see My throne , join those on My right , your left . " The words of Jesus were more than impressed on Rayford 's heart . He had actually heard them . He moved to his left without question , and as waves of people moved both directions , suddenly the view before Rayford became clear . Directly below and centered under the vast heavenly hosts , saints , and angels , a great platform bore a throne on which Jesus sat . Behind Him stood the three angels of mercy . On either side of Him stood the archangels Michael and Gabriel . Rayford knew instinctively that every living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained : " Half a billion or more were raptured seven years ago . Half the remaining population was killed during the Seal and Trumpet Judgments during the next three and a halfyears . Many more were lost during the Vial Judgments , and millions of believers were martyred . What you are looking at is probably only one-fourth of those who were left after the Rapture . And most of these will die today . " Indeed , Rayford realized , those assembling on Jesus ' right were scant compared to those on His left . It took most of the morning for the masses to find their places and settle . To Rayford it appeared that those to Jesus ' left were puzzled at best , frightened at worst . Gabriel stepped to the front of the platform and stretched out his arms for silence . " Worship the King of kings and Lord of lords ! " he shouted , and as one the millions on both sides of the throne fell to their knees . In a cacophony of languages and dialects they cried out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus began rising to their feet , while all around Rayford , everyone remained kneeling . " Clearly two different groups here , eh , Chaim ? " " Actually three , " the old man said . " Those are the ' goats ' over there , the followers of Antichrist who somehow survived to this point . You are among the ' sheep ' on this side , but I represent the third group . I am part of Jesus ' ' brethren , ' the chosen people of God whom the sheep befriended . We are the Jews who will go into the Millennium as believers , because of people like you . " Gabriel was gesturing that all should stand . When everyone was in place and quiet , he spoke in a loud voice : " John the revelator wrote : ' I saw an altar , and underneath it all the souls of those who had been martyred for preaching the Word of God and for being faithful in their witnessing . " ' They called loudly to the Lord and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will it be before You judge the people of the earth for what they 've done to us ? When will You avenge our blood against those living on the earth ? " " ' White robes were given to each of them , and they were told to rest a little longer until their other brothers , fellow servants of Jesus , had been martyred on the earth and joined them . ' " People of the earth , hearken your ears to me ! The time has been accomplished to avenge the blood of the martyrs against those living on the earth ! For the Son of Man has come in the glory of His Father with His angels , and He will now reward each according to his works ! As it is written , ' At that time , when I restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem , ' says the Lord , ' I will gather the world into the ' Valley Where Jehovah Judges ' and punish them there for harming My people , for scattering My inheritance among the nations and dividing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their slaves ; they traded a young lad for a prostitute , and a little girl for wine enough to get drunk . ' " The group to Jesus ' left immediately fell to their knees again and began shouting and wailing , " Jesus Christ is Lord ! Jesus Christ is Lord ! " Jesus stood and walked to the edge of the platform . With anger and yet sadness , He said , " Depart from Me , you cursed , into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels : for I was hungry and you gave Me no food ; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink ; I was a stranger and you did not take Me in , naked and you did not clothe Me , sick and in prison and you did not visit Me . " The millions began shouting and pleading , " Lord , when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and did not minister to You ? " Jesus said , " Assuredly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do it to one of the least of these , you did not do it to Me . You will go away into everlasting punishment , but the righteous into eternal life . " " No ! No ! No ! " But despite their numbers and the dissonance of their bawling , Jesus could be heard above them . " As the Father raises the dead and gives life to them , even so the Son gives life to whom He will . For the Father judges no one , but has committed all judgment to the Son , that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father . He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him . " " We honor You ! We do ! You are Lord ! " " Most assuredly , I say to you , he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life , and shall not come into judgment , but has passed from death into life . " But My Father has given Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son of Man . I can of Myself do nothing . As I hear , I judge ; and My judgment is righteous , because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me . " " Jesus is Lord ! " the condemned shouted . " Jesus is Lord ! " Gabriel stepped forward as Jesus returned to the throne . " Silence ! " Gabriel commanded . " Your time has come ! " Rayford watched , horrified despite knowing this was coming , as the " goats " to Jesus ' left beat their breasts and fell wailing to the desert floor , gnashing their teeth and pulling their hair . Jesus merely raised one hand a few inches and a yawning chasm opened in the earth , stretching far and wide enough to swallow all of them . They tumbled in , howling and screeching , but their wailing was soon quashed and all was silent when the earth closed itself again . Everyone on the platform moved back into place , and from the throne Jesus said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to pass , and as I have purposed , so it shall stand . " Gabriel came forward again . He said , " God 's Son , Jesus Christ our Lord , was born of the seed of David according to the flesh , and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead . " Through Him you have received grace . You also are the called of Jesus Christ ; grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . In His gospel the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith ; as it is written , ' The just shall live by faith . ' " The wrath of God has been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who suppressed the truth in unrighteousness , because what may be known of God was manifest in them , for God had shown it to them . " For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes were clearly seen , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal power and God-head , so that they are without excuse , because , although they knew God , they did not glorify Him as God , nor were thankful , but became futile in their thoughts , and their foolish hearts were darkened . Professing to be wise , they became fools , and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man-and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things . " Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness , in the lusts of their hearts , to dishonor their bodies among themselves , who exchanged the truth of God for the lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen . " " Amen ! " the assembled shouted . " These who have been cast into outer darkness and await the Great White Throne Judgment a thousand years hence were indeed without excuse . God sent His Holy Spirit as on the Day of Pentecost , plus the two preachers from heaven who proclaimed His gospel for three and a half years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warnings and acts of mercy were extended to these who continued to be lovers of themselves rather than of God . " It hit Rayford that all who were left were believers , worshipers of Christ , and that he himself was among those who would populate the millennial kingdom . Gabriel gestured that everyone should sit . When all were situated , he smiled broadly and pronounced loudly , " Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . Over such the second death has no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with Him a thousand years . " The Mighty One , God the Lord , has spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun to its going down . Out of Zion , the perfection of beauty , God will shine forth . Our God has come , and shall not keep silent ; He shall call to the heavens from above , and to the earth , that He may judge His people ! " With that Jesus stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other angels . And Jesus said , " Gather My saints together to Me , those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice ! Come forth ! " From everywhere , from the earth and beyond the clouds , came the souls of those who had died in faith , whom Chaim and Tsion had often referred to as " the believing dead " and whom Rayford knew now also included Tsion himself-along with many more of Rayford 's friends and loved ones . Jesus began by honoring the saints of the Old Testament , those Rayford had only heard and read about . Rather than handling this the way He had the individual audiences with the tribulation saints-supernaturally dealing with them all in what seemed an instant-Jesus this time gave the spectators His strength and patience . The ceremony must have gone on for days , Rayford eventually decided , but he felt neither hunger nor thirst , no fatigue , not even an ache or a cramp from sitting in the sand that long . He loved every minute , knowing that when Jesus finished with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyrs . Waiting for his friends and loved ones to be recognized would be akin to waiting for Chloe 's name to be called when she graduated from high school , but the reunion afterward would make it all worthwhile . He glanced at his watch every few hours and realized how long it had taken to cover most of the Old Testament saints . Many he had never heard of-either he had not studied enough or these were some whose exploits had not been recorded . And yet God knew . He knew their hearts , knew of their sacrifice , knew of their faith . And one by one Jesus honored them as He embraced them and they knelt at His feet , and He said , " Well done , good and faithful servant . " As they came to Him one by one , Jesus said , " Without faith it is impossible to please God , for he who comes to My Father must believe that He is , and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him . " There was Noah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " By faith , being divinely warned of things not yet seen , you moved with godly fear , prepared an ark for the saving of your household , by which you condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith . " Hours later it seemed everyone roused when it was Abraham 's turn . Jesus said , " By faith you obeyed when you were called to go out to the place you would receive as an inheritance . And you went out , not knowing where you were going . By faith you dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country , dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with you of the same promise ; for you waited for the city which had foundations , whose builder and maker was God . " Sarah was right behind him , and Jesus said to her , " By faith you yourself also received strength to conceive seed , and you bore a child when you were past the age , because you judged Him faithful who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and him as good as dead , were born as many as the stars of the sky in multitude-innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore . " Jesus addressed the spectators . " These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off were assured of them , embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth . For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland . And truly if they had called to mind that country from which they had come out , they would have had opportunity to return . But now they desire a better , that is , a heavenly country . Therefore I am not ashamed to be called their God , for I am preparing a city for them . " By faith Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac , and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son , of whom it was said , ' In Isaac your seed shall be called , ' concluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dead . " Later Jacob approached the throne , and Jesus said , " By faith , when you were dying , you blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshiped , leaning on the top of your staff . " And behind him , Joseph . Jesus told him , " By faith you , when you were dying , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel , and gave instructions concerning your bones . " All around , Jews began to stand . Soon everyone was on their feet . Moses himself was kneeling at the feet of Jesus with a man and a woman , and the Lord embraced them and said , " Well done , good and faithful servants . By faith , when your son was born , you hid him three months , because you saw he was a beautiful child ; and you were not afraid of the king 's command . " And you , Moses , when you became of age , by faith refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God than to enjoy the passing pleasure of sin , esteeming My reproach greater riches than the treasures in Egypt ; for you looked to the reward . By faith you forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for you endured as seeing Him who is invisible . " By faith you kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood , lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them . " By faith you led My children through the Red Sea as by dry land , whereas the Egyptians , attempting to do so , were drowned . " A woman knelt before Jesus . He said , " By faith , Rahab , you did not perish with those who did not believe , because you received My spies with peace . " When all the heroes of the Old Testament , including Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah , also David and Samuel and the prophets had been honored , Jesus stood and said , " These through faith subdued kingdoms , worked righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , became valiant in battle , turned to flight the armies of the aliens . " Women received their dead raised to life again . And others were tortured , not accepting deliverance , that they might obtain a better resurrection . " Still others had trial of mocking and scourgings , yes , and of chains and imprisonment . They were stoned , they were sawn in two , were tempted , were slain with the sword . They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins , being destitute , afflicted , tormented-of whom the world was not worthy . They wandered in deserts and mountains , in dens and caves of the earth . " And all these obtained a good testimony through faith . " " It might be a little late to be asking this , Chaim , " Rayford said , " but what kind of a relationship will I have with Irene now ? And Amanda . I know that 's the kind of question Jesus was asked when the Pharisees were trying to trip Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ (
