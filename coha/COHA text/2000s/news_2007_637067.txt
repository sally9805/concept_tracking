The Colonels ' tallest player is 6-foot-8 Darnell Dialls , who averages just 8.4 points a game . He will be no match inside for Tyler Hansbrough and his 18.8 points a game .

The Bruins , making their second straight NCAA tournament appearance , are led by Justin Hare and his 14 points a game . <p>  --  Chris Vivlamore <p> BRACKET TIP : Take Georgetown . Maybe twice .

No. 14 Oral Roberts ( 23-10 ) , 2:40 p.m . Thursday <p> ANALYSIS : Seeded No. 2 in the Pac-10 tournament , Washington State stumbled against Southern Cal in the semifinals , yet somehow the Cougars landed a No. 3 seed in the big tournament .

Friday <p> ANALYSIS : This is probably the last chance to see Kevin Durant in a college uniform . The Texas freshman was the Big 12 player of the year and led the Longhorns in scoring ( 25.3 per game ) and rebounding ( 11.3 ) . He may be the toughest matchup in the tournament because he can go inside and shoots the 3 .

But a late run and a trip to the SEC tournament finals got Arkansas in and got Heath some breathing room . Southern Cal coach Tim Floyd , much like his counterpart on the football field , has brought a pro style to the Trojans ' basketball team . Southern Cal likes to get up and down the floor , which should make this one a close encounter . <p>  --  Carter Strickland <p> BRACKET TIP : Floyd won at least one game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa State in the mid-1990s . <p> PREDICTION : If Arkansas makes a few 3s , it should move on . <p> TEAM : No. 6 Vanderbilt ( 20-11 ) vs . No. 11 G. Washington ( 23-8 ) , 5:10 p.m .

SEC player of the year Derrick Byars and the Commodores are physical , play defense as good as anyone in the field and must shoot well to win . George Washington , the Atlantic 10 champion , beat Virginia Tech early in the season and rolled through its conference tournament . <p>  --  Bill Sanders <p> BRACKET TIP : No. 6 seeds have a higher winning percentage than No. 5 seeds and win 69 percent of their first-round games . <p> PREDICTION : Vandy is beatable when on an off night .

Thursday <p> ANALYSIS : Marquette lost five of its last eight games after a 21-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if Tom Crean 's Golden Eagles get past Michigan State and his former boss Tom Izzo , they probably face North Carolina in the second round . But they 'll likely get back Jerel McNeal ( 14.7 points a game ) , who missed the Big East tournament with a thumb injury . Michigan State , which lost to Wisconsin in the Big Ten quarterfinals , is led by guard Drew Neitzel ( 18.1 points , 4.3 assists a game ) . <p>  --  Jeff Schultz <p> BRACKET TIP : If you believe in karma , pick Marquette to go a ways .
