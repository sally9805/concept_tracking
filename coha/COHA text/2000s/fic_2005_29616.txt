Chapter One I tossed my backpack in a corner of the studio and high fived Rodney on his way out . " Hey , Kitty , thanks again for taking the midnight shift , " he said . He 'd started playing some third-generation grunge band that made my hackles rise , but I smiled anyway . " Happy to . " " I noticed . You did n't used to like the late shift . " He was right . I 'd gone positively nocturnal the last few months . I shrugged . " Things change . " " Well , take it easy . " Finally , I had the place to myself . I dimmed the lights so the control board glowed , the dials and switches futuristic and sinister . I pulled my blond hair into a ponytail . I was wearing jeans and an oversized sweatshirt that had been through the wash too many times . One of the nice things about the late shift at a radio station was that I did n't have to look good for anybody . I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its squeaky wheels and torn upholstery . As soon as I could , I put on my music . Bauhaus straight into the Pogues . That 'd wake ' em up . To be a DJ was to be God . I controlled the airwaves . To be a DJ at an alternative public radio station ? That was being God with a mission . It was thinking you were the first person to discover The Clash and you had to spread the word . My illusions about the true power of beinga radio DJ had pretty much been shattered by this time . I 'd started out on the college radio station , graduated a couple of years ago , and got the gig at KNOB after interning here . I might have had a brain full of philosophical tenets , high ideals , and opinions I could n't wait to vocalize . But off-campus , no one cared . The world was a bigger place than that , and I was adrift . College was supposed to fix that , was n't it ? I switched on the mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Kitty on K-Nob . It 's twelve-oh-twelve in the wee hours and I 'm bored , which means I 'm going to regale you with inanities until somebody calls and requests a song recorded before 1990 . " I have the new issue of Wide World of News here . Picked it up when I got my frozen burrito for dinner . Headline says : ' Bat Boy Attacks Convent . ' Now , this is like the tenth Bat Boy story they 've done this year . That kid really gets around-though as long as they 've been doing stories on him he 's got to be what , fifty ? Anyway , as visible as this guy is , at least according to the intrepid staff of Wide World of News , I figure somebody out there has seen him . Have any of you seen the Bat Boy ? I want to hear about it . The line is open . " Amazingly , I got a call right off . I would n't have to beg . " Hello ! " " Uh , yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Jam ? " " What did I say ? Did you hear me ? Nothing after ' 89 . Bye . " Another call was waiting . Double cool . " Hi there . " " Do you believe in vampires ? " I paused . Any other DJ would have tossed off a glib response without thinking-just another midnight weirdo looking for attention . But I knew better . " If I say yes , will you tell me a good story ? " " So , do you ? " The speaker was male . His voice was clear and steady . I put my smile into my voice . " Yes . " " The Bat Boy stories , I think they 're a cover-up . All those tabloid stories , and the TV shows like Uncharted World ? " " Yeah ? " " Everybody treats them like they 're a joke . Too far out , too crazy . Just mindless trash . So if everybody thinks that stuff is a joke , if there really is something out there-no one would believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that what you 're saying ? Talk about weird supernatural things just enough to make them look ridiculous and you deflect attention from the truth . " " Yes , that 's it . " " So , who exactly is covering up what ? " " They are . The vampires . They 're covering up , well , everything . Vampires , werewolves , magic , crop circles- " " Slow down there , Van Helsing . " " Do n't call me that ! " He sounded genuinely angry . " Why not ? " " It's-I 'm not anything like him . He was a murderer . " The hairs on my arms stood on end . I leaned into the mike . " And what are you ? " He let out a breath that echoed over the phone . " Never mind . I called about the tabloid . " " Yes , Bat Boy . You think Bat Boy is a vampire ? " " Maybe not specifically . But before you brush it off , think about what may really be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I already knew . " Thanks for the tip . " He hung up . " What an intriguing call , " I said , half to myself , almost forgetting I was on the air . The world he talked about-vampires , werewolves , things that go bump-was a secret one , even to the people who inadvertently found their way there . People fell into it by accident and were left to sink or swim . Usually sink . Once inside , you especially did n't talk about it to outsiders because , well , who would believe you ? But we were n't really talking here , were we ? It was late-night radio . It was a joke . I squared my shoulders , putting my thoughts back in order . " Right . This raises all sorts of possibilities . I have to know-did I just get a call from some wacko ? Or is something really out there ? Do you have a story to tell about something that is n't supposed to exist ? Call me . " I put on Concrete Blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incoming call flashed before the song 's first bass chord sounded . I was n't sure I wanted anyone to call . If I could keep making jokes , I could pretend that everything was normal . I picked up the phone . " Hold , please , " I said and waited for the song to end . I took a few deep breaths , half-hoping that maybe the caller just wanted to hear some Pearl Jam . " All right . Kitty here . " " Hi-I think I know what that guy 's talking about . You know how they say that wolves have been extinct around here for over fifty years ? Well-my folks have a cabin up in Nederland , and I swear I 've heard wolves howling around there . Every summer I 've heard them . I called the wildlife people about it once , but they just told me the same thing . They 're extinct . But I do n't believe them . " " Are you sure they 're wolves ? Maybe they 're coyotes . " That was me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been to those woods , and I knew she was right . Well , half-right . " I know what coyotes sound like , and it 's not anything like that . Maybe-maybe they 're something else . Werewolves or something , you know ? " " Have you ever seen them ? " " No . I 'm kind of afraid to go out there at night . " " That 's probably just as well . Thanks for calling . " As soon as I hung up , the next call was waiting . " Hello ? " " Hi-do you think that guy was really a vampire ? " " I do n't know . Do you think he was ? " " Maybe . I mean-I go to nightclubs a lot , and sometimes people show up there , and they just do n't fit . They 're , like , way too cool for the place , you know ? Like , scary cool , like they should be in Hollywood or something and what the hell are they doing here- " " Grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagination is a wonderful thing . I 'm going to go to the next call now-hello ? " " Hi . I got ta say-if there really were vampires , do n't you think someone would have noticed by now ? Bodies with bite marks dumped in alleys- " " Unless the coroner reports cover up cause of death- " The calls kept coming . " Just because someone 's allergic to garlic does n't mean- " " What is it with blood anyway- " " If a girl who 's a werewolf got pregnant , what would happen to the baby when she changed into a wolf ? Would it change into a wolf cub ? " " Flea collars . And rabies shots . Do werewolves need rabies shots ? " Then came the Call . Everything changed . I 'd been toeing the line , keeping things light . Keeping them unreal . I was trying to be normal , really I was . I worked hard to keep my real life-my day job , so to speak-away from the rest . I 'd been trying to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still had n't learned to live in very well . Lately , it had felt like a losing battle . " Hi , Kitty . " His voice was tired , flat . " I 'm a vampire . I know you believe me . " My belief must have showed through in my voice all night . That must have been why he called me . " Okay , " I said . " Can-can I talk to you about something ? " " Sure . " " I 'm a vampire . I was attacked and turned involuntarily about five years ago . I 'm also-at least I used to be-a devout Catholic . It 's been really ... hard . All the jokes about blood and the Eucharist aside-I ca n't walk into a church anymore . I ca n't go to Mass . And I ca n't kill myself because that 's wrong . Catholic doctrine teaches that my soul is lost , that I 'm a blot on God 's creation . But Kitty-that 's not what I feel . Just because my heart has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does it ? " I was n't a minister ; I was n't a psychologist . I 'd majored in English , for crying out loud . I was n't qualified to counsel anyone on his spiritual life . But my heart went out to him , because he sounded so sad . All I could do was try . " You ca n't exactly go to your local priest to hash this out , can you ? " " No , " he said , chuckling a little . " Right . Have you ever read Paradise Lost ? " " Uh , no . " " Of course not , no one reads anymore . Paradise Lost is Milton 's great epic poem about the war in heaven , the rebellion of the angels , the fall of Lucifer , and the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden . As an aside , some people believe this was the time when vampires and lycanthropes came into existence-Satan 's mockery of God 's greatest creation . Whatever . At any rate , in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long monologues what he 's thinking , his soul-searching . He 's debating about whether or not to take revenge on God for exiling him from heaven . After reading this for a while , you realize that Satan 's greatest sin , his greatest mistake , was n't pride or rebelling against God . His greatest mistake was believing that God would not forgive him if he asked for forgiveness . His sin was n't just pride-it was self-pity . I think in some ways every single person , human , vampire , whatever , has a choice to make : to be full of rage about what happens to you or to reconcile with it , to strive for the most honorable existence you can despite the odds . Do you believe in a God who understands and forgives or one who does n't ? What it comes down to is , this is between you and God , and you 'll have to work that out for yourself . " " That-that sounds okay . Thanks . Thanks for talking to me . " " You 're welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I did n't go straight home and to bed , even though I was shaking . All the talking had taken a lot out of me . After a late shift I always met T.J. for coffee at the diner down the street . He 'd be waiting for me . He was n't , but I ordered coffee and when it arrived , so did he . Slouching in an army surplus coat , glancing around to take note of every person in the place , he did n't look at me until he slid into the booth . " Hey , Kitty . " He flagged the waitress for a cup of coffee . The sky outside was gray , paling with the sunrise . " How 'd your shift go ? " " You did n't listen to it ? " I tried not to sound disappointed , but I 'd been hoping to talk to him about it . " No , sorry . I was out . " I closed my eyes and took a deep , quiet breath . Grease , cigarette smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it all in , every little odor . But strongest , right across the booth from me , was the earthy smell of forest , damp night air , and fur . The faintest touch of blood set my hair on end . " You went running . You turned wolf , " I said , frowning . He looked away , ducking his gaze . " Geez , if you keep doing that , you 're going to lose it completely- " " I know , I know . I 'm halfway there already . I just-it feels so good . " His look grew distant , vacant . Part of him was still in that forest , running wild in the body of his wolf . The only time we had to Change was on full moon nights . But we could Change whenever we wanted . Some did as often as they could , all the time . And the more they did , the less human they became . They went in packs even as people , living together , shape-shifting and hunting together , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changed , the harder it was not to . " Come with me next time . Tomorrow . " " Full moon 's not for another week , " I said . " I 'm trying my damnedest to keep it together . I like being human . " He looked away , tapping his fork on the table . " You really are n't cut out for this life , you know . " " I do okay . " That was me patting myself on the back for not going stark raving mad these last couple of years , since the attack that changed me . Or not getting myself ripped limb from limb by other werewolves who saw a cute young thing like me as easy prey . All that , and I maintained a semblance of normal human life as well . Not much of a human life , all things considered . I had a rapidly aging bachelor 's degree from CU , a run-down studio apartment , a two-bit DJ gig that barely paid rent , and no prospects . Sometimes , running off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three months ago , I missed my mother 's birthday party because it fell on the night of the full moon . I could n't be there , smiling and sociable in my folks ' suburban home in Aurora while the wolf part of me was on the verge of tearing herself free , gnawing through the last fringes of my self-control . I made some excuse , and Mom said she understood . But it showed so clearly how , in an argument between the two halves , the wolf usually won . Since then , maintaining enthusiasm for the human life had been difficult . Useless , even . I slept through the day , worked nights , and thought more and more about those times I ran in the forest as a wolf , with the rest of the pack surrounding me . I was on the verge of trading one family for the other . I went home , slept , and rolled back to KNOB toward evening . Ozzie , the station manager , an aging hippie type who wore his thinning hair in a ponytail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every one of them . " What 's this ? " " I was going to ask you the same thing . What the hell happened on your shift last night ? We 've been getting calls all day . The line was busy all night . And the messages-six people claiming to be vampires , two say they 're werewolves , and one wants to know if you can recommend a good exorcist . " " Really ? " I said , sorting through the messages . " Yeah . Really . But what I really want to know- " He paused , and I wondered how much trouble I was in . I was supposed to run a late-night variety music format , the kind of show where Velvet Underground followed Ella Fitzgerald . Thinking back on it , I 'd talked the entire time , had n't I ? I 'd turned it into a talk show . I was going to lose my job , and I did n't think I 'd have the initiative to get another one . I could run to the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Whatever you did last night-can you do it again ? " ( Continues ... )
