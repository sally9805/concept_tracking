Week 1 08:54 P.M. MONDAY 07.10.06 So , right off the bat , I have to say that this whole blog thing you 've set up is totally gay . Now , I know that being gay and all I really should n't use " gay " in such a derogatory way , but what can I say ? Writing blogs is so damn GAY I ca n't even discuss it . But this was your idea and you 're supposedly straight , which makes the whole thing somewhat disturbing , actually : that straight-old-you could come up with such a gay-old-idea for keeping in touch over the course of the summer . But I guess there 's no accounting for sexuality or something . And I know I agreed to do this when we talked and everything , but still , I just have to let you know my true thoughts on this matter before going any further with this gay exercise in futility . I just do n't see why simple e-mail would not suffice . I mean , people have been using that since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  same difference ) as a decent mode of effective , semi-instant communication . So I do n't know why you 're so set on this Xanga.com , blogosphere thing . And why , good God , did you have to go and title the thing " Tale of Two Summers " ? I mean , you make it sound like some friggin ' Judy Blume novel ! Now , I know your whole rationale for this is that e-mails are disposable and deletable and you want to have a record of our big summer apart so that when we 're 30 we can look back on it and be like , man , what a couple of losers we were back in the teenage day . But believe me , I will not be longing to look back and see what a pair of idiots we were for saving an online record of our every little thought and meaningless activity , especially when , on my end at least , there is really not gon na be much to report . Except , of course , my farting . Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , much better . Regardless  --  here is my first entry . Are you happy yet ? I 'm not . It 's Monday night and it 's been a crummy first day of you not being here in crappy old Wheaton , Maryland . If there is any place more boring on earth to spend a sweltering summer by my goddamn self , I ca n't think of one . And you know what ? If I could think of a place that was more stultifying , I might even go there just for a change of scenery , because , after almost 16 years , the sheer deadliness of our little ' burb is really starting to bug me out . Then , on top of that , toss into the mix the fact that I had my first day back at good ol ' Einstein H.S. for day one of " Driving Instruction and Road Safety Training " ( formerly known as " Driver 's Ed " ; see " 20th century " ) , and I am clearly about ready to lose it . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it again : You are the luckiest damn dog to go hang out at the University of Maryland for the balance of the summer and learn your craft as an actor/singer/waiter . I only wish I had some ounce of talent to join you , but , as we all know , my only talent worth mentioning ( i.e. , farting ) is , uh , not worth mentioning . Badump-chik ! Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .... I 'm here all summer . That 's right , ALL SUMMER ! OK  --  enough bitching . I can already see you shaking your head at my misanthropic missive . Still , being stuck here all alone for the next six weeks is a major drag , especially given the fact that you 're not really that far away , even , just a few miles around the old Beltway . You know , I still do n't see why I ca n't just come visit for an afternoon or hang out with you after dinner or something . What is up with UMD 's severe anti-guest policy ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you with my lack-of-talent and cause an uncontrollable outbreak of averageness or something . But I digress .... So I guess I 'll get to the business at hand , which is " keeping in touch . " Christ  --  now I 've lost my train of thought . This is why the occasional phone call would be easier ! ! ! They must have a few pay phones there ? Oh right  --  you said something about how I 'm uncommunicative on the phone . Well , you know , this was news to me . I think I 'm always pretty forthcoming and chatty on the phone , whether discussing what asshole called me a faggot in the hall that day or giving a recap of the latest heartbreak on The O.C. So I 'm not sure what you meant by uncommunicative and  --  wait a second . I get it . NOW you 're gon na say , " Well , why did n't you ask me when we were talking  --  that 's being uncommunicative . " So this was some sort of trap , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that heart-to-heart in the driveway was creeping me out . You actors are so damn emotional sometimes . What is up with that ? ! All right , I keep getting distracted here because it takes so much longer to write some passing thought than to just say it . And since I ca n't just talk to you , I 'm trying to make this bloody blog work as a one-sided conversation as opposed to some old-fashioned " journal . " But I will now try to be coherent and cohesive and give you a running account of insert drum roll here ... MY FIRST DAY OF SUMMER WITHOUT CHUCK Our story begins way too bright and much too early with Valerie rousing me at 7:30 for the usual breakfast bonanza of eggs/bacon/ bagels/juice/fruit cup/coffee . Fortunately , I managed to decline everything except the juice and , despite my lack of cooperation , she was kind enough to drop me at Einstein on her way to work . It was so weird to be back there in the summer ... the place is so damn empty , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own feet and not the usual stampede of thousands . And guess what ? No , no  --  sorry , not that either . I was n't harassed once ! The one and only plus of the day . Our driving class was located just off the main corridor , 115-B . Where we had English last year , ' member ? As for the class itself , there are about 20 people enrolled in hell with me , most of whom I do n't know because they are kids from the year ahead of us ( me being the sage of our class due to my August b-day ) and/or they are from other county schools . One person I did know which you will find hi-lar-i-ous is Joey Kelly , from back in da day at Randolph Elementary ? I had n't seen him since graduation , but he still looked the same  --  that is , retarded . Just taller and bigger and , thus , more retarded . Even though he goes to Prep now , Joey is still the same old cheap-ass he was in eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving class . Anyway , Joey was wondering what you 're up to , so I told him , and he made fun of the whole summer-theater-camp thing  --  what a shocker , right ? I mean , did Joey ever have a positive reaction to anyone 's good news ... ever ? Fortunately , I was able to avoid sitting next to Joey by deftly pretending I knew someone else in the class , even though I did n't know a bloody soul . Pretty good acting for an amateur . ( Hey  --  any last-minute openings in your improv class ? ) So I snagged a seat in the back row next to this hot blonde chick named Brett . Have you ever heard of a girl named Brett ? Neither had I , but she is definitely 100 percent girl . I know I 'm not supposed to notice these things now that I 'm officially a guy-lover , but DAMN  --  this girl has got it going on , being majorly stacked and sporting the cutest face I 've ever seen . You know what ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seems like a wicked bad seed . Which , of course , is why I gravitated to her immediately ( heh-heh ... ) . Our driving instructor ? Uhhhh , not so cute . It 's this hulking goon who also does time as an assistant coach for the football team , Mr. Tlucek . ( Remember him ? From your ill-fated year on JV ? ) OMG  --  this guy is such a tool ! The first thing he says to us in this deeply serious " I-am-God " voice was this little gem : " Listen up , people , driving is not a right . It 's a privilege . " What the hell ! I mean , I know it 's not on the Bill of Rights or anything , but a " privilege " ? I thought it was my right when I turn age 16 in , oh , 28 days , to get my driver 's license and finally have the right to get the F out of Wheaton at 70 mph without looking back . But I guess I was mistook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drops this line on us with all the seriousness of Moses on the Mount , Brett and I turn to each other , our eyes rolling way up into the backs of our heads , and start cracking up . That 's when I knew we would click . She is a trip ! Later , during our break , she said she could n't give a crap whether driving is a right , a privilege , or a door prize . She 's only taking the class to humor her ' rents and does n't even want to get a license when she 's done . Her attitude is like , " Why should I learn how to drive when boys are gon na take me where I want to go anyway ? " I was of half a mind to be like , " hells yeah ... me , too ! " Until , that is , I realized the pool of eligible Einstein homos to shuttle me around the D.C. metro area is slightly smaller than the one Brett 's working with . ( Who 'm I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I even told her this line , and she busted out laughing . Check it out  --  she did n't seem to mind the whole gay thing at all , which was refreshing for a change , right ? Go Brett ! Yeaaaaa ! Insert queerleaders doing a cheer . So on that rare , " campy " note I will end my first entry . I hope all this useless information about my so-called life today in Wheaton ( a.k.a. the Black Hole of Suburbia ) has truly enlightened you and brought us closer than ever . ( Yeah , right . ) Thusly , I will sign off , as always , your friend , confidante , and troubled soul ... Hal . PS  --  Have you gotten laid yet at " college " ? 09:05 A.M. TUESDAY 07.11.06 Dear Whiny in Wheaton , Well . In the one day that I have been gone from your life you have lost none of your knack for being a raving lunatic . Thank God I set this blog up so at least you 'll have an outlet for your half-baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be standing outside of 7-Eleven saying these things out loud . To people . Normal people . Which means , of course , you 'd be in jail by now . And surely Wheaton would be a safer place . ( ha ) I 'm writing you from the fancy McKibbin Library computer center on my half hour of free time before our first workshop of the day . It 's too bad we ca n't IM or something , but I 'm assuming there are no computers in driving class , where you 're currently trapped . Despite all your protests , I think you 've taken to the blog pretty decently . Since we wo n't exactly be around to share the details of our summer adventures directly , I still wan na at least know them all indirectly . Which is why I thought the blog would be a cool way to keep in touch  --  longer than e-mails and , yes , something that we can look back on . Why you may ask ? Well , ignoring dark Prince Hal 's typically grim predictions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For BOTH of us . You 're gon na get your driver 's license , which is like a passport to freedom , despite what Tlucek may say . ( Voice of God  --  that 's so true ! ) And I 'm gon na get to live like a real bachelor and meet lots of hot chicks from all over the state who have no idea what an ass I am . Hopefully , their ignorance will get me laid . Eventually . And no , it has n't happened yet . Yet . Implying it will . Soon . And do n't roll your eyes at me like that .... Despite my lack of sexual action so far , there is still tons to report . So much that I do n't know where to start . I 've been here only two days and it feels like a month  --  all these new faces and places . I guess I 'll start with my swinging bachelor pad . I 'm on the third floor of St. Ann 's Hall , an old , red-brick dorm , sharing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Charles . However , unlike me , he does not go by Chuck . Not even Charlie . Get this  --  he demands to be known as " Chaz . " I was like , whaaaaatttt ? ! But he was insistent about it . Said it was his stage name . Chaz . Oooo-kay . Now , as you may have guessed from the nickname and the attitude , Chaz is a lover of men . ( Gays at theater camp  --  shocking , right ? ) Not that we had a big discussion about this or anything . Nothing like your coming-out chat back in January , that 's for sure . No  --  I found this out because in the first 10 minutes of our conversation Chaz mentioned two of his ex-boyfriends and alluded to two others . I was like , " Dude , how many exes do you have ? " He said five , total , but he does n't talk about the fifth guy , getting all dramatic about it , saying he is the " one whose name can not be uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-boyfriend formerly known as Prince ? " Chaz is a serious character . Get this  --  last night he started getting into this whole project to " revamp " our dorm room . No joke ! Chaz was flipping through an Ikea catalog till all hours and , as I type , he is sitting at a terminal next to me ordering stuff online . He said he wants to make our place feel , and I quote , " more like a cute artist 's studio than a cramped dorm room . " Oh yeah  --  we 're not actors or singers . Chaz insists that we are artists . ( ? ! ? ! ) So , as you may have guessed , Chaz is slightly insane . But his madness , fortunately , is more on the positive/productive side . Unlike some people I know who will remain anonymous . Hey  --  you know what ? ! I just had a brainstorm . Maybe Chaz would be a good balance for your darker brand of insanity . You guys would be a pretty interesting couple . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'm the gay matchmaker ! LOL As for me and Chaz " living together , " you do n't have to worry about him hitting on me or anything like that . Chaz was pretty straight about this . ( ha ) He said that I was n't his type . Thanks  --  I guess . Not that I wanted to hit it with Chaz or anything , or even be admired by him . It 's just that lately it seems like I am no one 's type , gay or straight or slightly crooked or anything . Even here at UMD . Seriously . You see , there are an outrageous number of hot SummerArts honeys who have caught my eye . So many . But so far , no one seems to be catching back , you know ? I thought I 'd be getting something going on instantly since a ) we 're all away from home and b ) we 're all looking for summer lovin ' . But nothing . Chaz tried to calm me down on the chick thing , saying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sing ! ) , " we are here to learn how to be artists , not hunt down sexual game . " LOL He really is serious about this " artist " thing . It 's funny , because I never really thought of myself as an artist . And though The Chaz had a point , I do sorta wan na get laid too . I mean , I am away at college ! ( kinda ) Even if it is only about 10 miles from Wheaton , I might as well be on another planet . I mean , dude  --  I have a dorm room ! With no parents telling me what to do or where I 'm going or when they 'll be back or anything ! ! ! Well , that 's not 100 percent true . There is a resident assistant , or RA , who is technically in charge . But he 's a junior at UMD and very cool , saying we can do what we want as long as the lights are out and doors shut by one A.M. One A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , ' cause I told them when I called home last night from the pay phone at the student union . Get this  --  Bob and Helen were complaining that I sounded tired already because I was n't getting enough rest . They are such worriers . Which is to say , they are such parents . Anyway , I 've got ta wrap this up as we have to get to our voice class and it 's on the other side of campus . ( UMD is so massive  --  the size of 20 Einsteins ! ) Later today , the faculty is gon na meet with us to talk about the show that we 're gon na be putting together over the course of the next six weeks . If it 's Fiddler , then I definitely have to play matchmaker for you and Chaz  --  it 'll be a sign ! LOL Seriously , though , I ca n't wait to find out what we 're gon na be doing ... and , of course , if I can play the lead . Yeah , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're probably wondering why I 'm even questioning it . But this is the big leagues , bro . Everyone here played the leads at their own schools ! So scoring a big role here would actually mean something , because everyone is so talented . OK  --  I 'm gon na stop being such a " drama fag " now and sign off . But one last thing . Your last entry was a little , how can I put this ... bitter ? And I know you 're bummed about being left to your own devices this summer . But please do me one favor : Do n't be such a dark cloud in the middle of July . You can actually be a nice guy when you 're not being such a self-inflicted mope . And maybe you 'll even meet some interesting guys in your class ( other than that dumb-ass Joey , of course ) . All right  --  good luck with driving , and try not to hit anything . Remember , this is real life , not " GTA : Vice City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
