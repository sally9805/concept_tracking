Now he has written his autobiography , It 's Not Easy Bein ' Me : A Lifetime of No Respect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs . Jeffrey Ressner talked to Dangerfield at his Los Angeles home , where the comedian is still wisecracking after undergoing brain surgery last year . <P> YOU 'RE 82 YEARS OLD AND MARRIED TO A MUCH YOUNGER WOMAN . HOW 'S YOUR SEX LIFE ? I tell you , my sex life today is the same as when I was a kid in my 20s . I never got anything then either . <P> YOUR NEW AUTOBIOGRAPHY DELVES INTO YOUR EXTREME FONDNESS FOR MARIJUANA . DO YOU STILL SMOKE POT ? Once in a while , yeah . It still relaxes me . You get a different head because of your age , but not because of the pot . Marijuana should definitely be legal . Booze is a hundred times worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do when you 're high is have a fight . <P> BACK IN THE DAY , YOU KNEW LENNY BRUCE . AND TODAY YOU OCCASIONALLY APPEAR ON HOWARD STERN 'S SHOW . DO YOU THINK THERE 'S SUCH A THING AS CROSSING THE LINE IN COMEDY ? I guess you can do that if you do an insulting ethnic joke or something like that . I work blue , very blue , you know . But I 'm also working in Vegas for an all-adult audience . Sometimes I see parents walking out of the show with their kids who are , like , 10 years old . <P> YOU ONCE QUIT COMEDY FOR 12 YEARS TO SELL ALUMINUM SIDING IN NEW JERSEY . DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING SELLING SIDING THAT HELPED WHEN YOU WENT BACK TO COMEDY ? No , but I learned something about selling things from doing comedy . In both fields , the most important ingredient is , you 've got ta be liked . Whether you 're selling aluminum siding or going onstage , you got ta make ' em like you and believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DANGERFIELD 'S . HOW DID YOUR CLUB MANAGE TO SURVIVE WHEN SO MANY OTHER COMEDY CLUBS SHUT THEIR DOORS ? The smorgasbord . No , seriously , it 's an old-fashioned nightclub , it 's comfortable , it 's run right . We have a lot of high schools that hold their proms there . <P> IN 1995 , YOU BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST ENTERTAINERS TO START A WEBSITE . WHAT 'S YOUR FAVORITE THING ABOUT THE INTERNET ? I knew right away it would transform communication . It 's a tremendous thing to be able to communicate with your fans . I can ask questions and get answers right away . <P> ONSTAGE YOU 'RE ALWAYS TUGGING AT YOUR TIE . WHERE DID THAT GESTURE COME FROM ? It came naturally . One night my collar was too tight , and I started doing it and just kept doing it . I have a problem with clothes  --  I never know what to wear . So I wear the same thing at every show : a black suit , white shirt and red tie . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that one . <P> DO YOU THINK BEING DEPRESSED IS AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD FOR A COMEDIAN ? That 's the way it is ; what can I tell you ? The better the comedian , the more depressed he is . When I was 15 , I tried to escape being unhappy by writing jokes . So , yeah , it 's possible that comedy is an escape from depression .
