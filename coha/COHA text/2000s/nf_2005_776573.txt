And Puppy Makes Three // We were young . We were in love . We were rollicking in those sublime early days of marriage when life seems about as good as life can get . We could not leave well enough alone . And so on a January evening in 1991 , my wife of fifteen months and I ate a quick dinner together and headed off to answer a classified ad in the Palm Beach Post . // Why we were doing this , I was n't quite sure . A few weeks earlier I had awoken just after dawn to find the bed beside me empty . I got up and found Jenny sitting in her bathrobe at the glass table on the screened porch of our little bungalow , bent over the newspaper with a pen in her hand . // There was nothing unusual about the scene . Not only was the Palm Beach Post our local paper , it was also the source of half of our household income . We were a two-newspaper-career couple . Jenny worked as a feature writer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a news reporter at the competing paper in the area , the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , based an hour south in Fort Lauderdale . We began every morning poring over the newspapers , seeing how our stories were played and how they stacked up to the competition . We circled , underlined , and clipped with abandon . // But on this morning , Jenny 's nose was not in the news pages but in the classified section . When I stepped closer , I saw she was feverishly circling beneath the heading " Pets  --  Dogs . " // " Uh , " I said in that new-husband , still-treading-gently voice . " Is there something I should know ? " // She did not answer . // " Jen-Jen ? " // " It 's the plant , " she finally said , her voice carrying a slight edge of desperation . // " The plant ? " I asked . // " That dumb plant , " she said . " The one we killed . " // The one we killed ? I was n't about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the plant that I bought and she killed . I had surprised her with it one night , a lovely large dieffenbachia with emerald-and-cream variegated leaves . " What 's the occasion ? " she 'd asked . But there was none . I 'd given it to her for no reason other than to say , " Damn , is n't married life great ? " // She had adored both the gesture and the plant and thanked me by throwing her arms around my neck and kissing me on the lips . Then she promptly went on to kill my gift to her with an assassin 's coldhearted efficiency . Not that she was trying to ; if anything , she nurtured the poor thing to death . Jenny did n't exactly have a green thumb . Working on the assumption that all living things require water , but apparently forgetting that they also need air , she began flooding the dieffenbachia on a daily basis . // " Be careful not to overwater it , " I had warned . // " Okay , " she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sicker the plant got , the more she doused it , until finally it just kind of melted into an oozing heap . I looked at its limp skeleton in the pot by the window and thought , Man , someone who believes in omens could have a field day with this one . // Now here she was , somehow making the cosmic leap of logic from dead flora in a pot to living fauna in the pet classifieds . Kill a plant , buy a puppy . Well , of course it made perfect sense . // I looked more closely at the newspaper in front of her and saw that one ad in particular seemed to have caught her fancy . She had drawn three fat red stars beside it . It read : " Lab puppies , yellow . AKC purebred . All shots . Parents on premises . " // " So , " I said , " can you run this plant-pet thing by me one more time ? " // " You know , " she said , looking up . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even keep a stupid houseplant alive . I mean , how hard is that ? All you need to do is water the damn thing . " // Then she got to the real issue : " If I ca n't even keep a plantalive , how am I ever going to keep a baby alive ? " She looked like she might start crying . // The Baby Thing , as I called it , had become a constant in Jenny 's life and was getting bigger by the day . When we had first met , at a small newspaper in western Michigan , she was just a few months out of college , and serious adulthood still seemed a far distant concept . For both of us , it was our first professional job out of school . We ate a lot of pizza , drank a lot of beer , and gave exactly zero thought to the possibility of someday being anything other than young , single , unfettered consumers of pizza and beer . // But years passed . We had barely begun dating when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  pulled us in different directions across the eastern United States . At first we were one hour 's drive apart . Then we were three hours apart . Then eight , then twenty-four . By the time we both landed together in South Florida and tied the knot , she was nearly thirty . Her friends were having babies . Her body was sending her strange messages . That once seemingly eternal window of procreative opportunity was slowly lowering . // I leaned over her from behind , wrapped my arms around her shoulders , and kissed the top of her head . " It 's okay , " I said . But I had to admit , she raised a good question . Neither of us had ever really nurtured a thing in our lives . Sure , we 'd had pets growing up , but they did n't really count . We always knew our parents would keep them alive and well . We both knew we wanted to one day have children , but was either of us really up for the job ? Children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were helpless and fragile and looked like they would break easily if dropped . //
