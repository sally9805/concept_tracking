Chapter One THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY for Cumberland County , North Carolina , Marc Sherman , pushed the old wooden captain 's chair away from the prosecution table , and it made a harsh , scraping eeek in the nearly silent courtroom . Then Sherman rose and slowly approached the jury box , where nine women and three men - six white , six African American - waited with anticipation to hear what he had to say . They liked Sherman . He knew that , even expected it . He also knew that he had already won this dramatic murder case , even without the stirring summation he was about to give . But he was going to give this closing anyway . He felt the need to see Sergeant Ellis Cooper held accountable for his crimes . The soldier had committed the most heinous and cowardly murders in the history of Cumberland County , North Carolina . The so-called Bluelady Murders . The people in this county expected Sherman to punish Ellis Cooper , who happened to be a black man , and he would n't disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing this for a while - seventeen years , to be exact . In all that time , I have never encountered murders such as those committed in December last , by the defendant , Sergeant Ellis Cooper . What began as a jealous rage aimed at one victim , Tanya Jackson , spilled over into the shameless massacre of three women . All were wives , all were mothers . Together these women had eleven children and , of course , three grieving husbands and countless other family members , neighbors , and dear friends . " The fateful night was a Friday , ' ladies ' night " for Tanya Jackson , Barbara Green , and Maureen Bruno . While their husbands enjoyed their usual card night at Fort Bragg , the wives got together for some personal talk , some laughter , and the treasured companionship of one another . Tanya , Barbara , and Maureen were great friends , you understand . This Friday night get-together took place at the home of the Jacksons , where Tanya and Abraham were raising their four children . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen shots of alcohol at the base , Sergeant Cooper went to the Jackson house . As you have heard in sworn testimony , he was seen outside the front door by two neighbors . He was yelling for Mrs. Jackson to come out . " Then Sergeant Cooper barged into the house . Using an RTAK survival knife , a lightweight weapon favored by United States Army Special Forces , he attacked the woman who had spurned his advances . He killed Tanya Jackson instantly with a single knife thrust . " Sergeant Ellis Cooper then turned the knife on thirtyone- year-old Barbara Green . And finally , on Maureen Bruno , who nearly made it out of the slaughterhouse but was caught by Cooper at the front door . All three women were killed with thrusts delivered by a powerful male , who has taught hand-to-hand fighting techniques at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center , headquarters for the Army Special Forces . " The survival knife has been identified as Sergeant Cooper 's personal property , a deadly weapon he had kept since the early 1970s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the knife . " His prints were also found on the clothing of Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Green . DNA from particles of skin found under the nails of Mrs. Jackson were matched to Sergeant Cooper . Strands of his hair were found at the murder scene . The murder weapon itself was discovered hidden in the attic of Cooper 's house . So were pathetic ' love letters ' he had written to Tanya Jackson - returned unopened . " You have seen unspeakable photographs of what Sergeant Cooper did to the three women . Once they were dead , he painted the women 's faces with ghoulish-looking blue paint . He painted their chests and stomachs . It is gruesome and twisted . As I said , the worst murders I have ever encountered . You know that there can be only one verdict . That verdict is guilty ! Put this monster down ! " Suddenly , Sergeant Ellis Cooper rose from his seat at the defendant 's table . The courtroom audience gasped . He was six feet four and powerfully built . At age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it had been when he enlisted in the army at eighteen . He was wearing his dress greens , and the medals on his chest included a Purple Heart , a Distinguished Service Cross , and a Silver Star . He looked impressive , even under the circumstances of the murder trial , and then he spoke in a clear , booming voice . " I did n't kill Tanya Jackson , or any of those poor women . I never went inside the house that night . I did n't paint any bodies blue . I 've never killed anyone , except for my country . I did n't kill those women . I 'm innocent ! I 'm a war hero , for God 's sake ! " Sergeant Cooper hurdled the wooden gate at the front of the courtroom . He was on Marc Sherman in seconds , knocking him to the floor , punching him in the face and chest . " You liar , liar ! " Cooper shouted . " Why are you trying to kill me ? " When the courtroom marshals finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were torn , his face bloodied . Marc Sherman struggled to his feet and then he turned back to the jury . " Need I say more ? The verdict is guilty . Put this monster down . " ( Continues ... )
