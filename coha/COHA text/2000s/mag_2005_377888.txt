Oil prices have passed $50 a barrel , and fears abound that they 're headed higher over the long term . What 's next for oil , and what might higher prices mean for the global economy ? To find out , AMY FELDMAN debriefed DANIEL YERGIN , one of the world 's foremost oil experts . Yergin , 58 , is chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , a member of the Secretary of Energy 's advisory board and author of the Pulitzer prizewinning book The Prize : The Epic Quest for Oil , Money and Power . <P> Q : Will oil prices remain this high ? <P> A : We 've entered a new era of oil prices . It sneaked up on people , but now it 's all too evident . There is a new floor under the price of oil of around $40 a barrel . I 'm struck that the oil market today is tighter than it was on the eve of the 1973 crisis . And with markets this tight , you 'll see a lot more volatility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $80 . How high they go depends on geopolitics and market psychology . <P> Q : To what extent is the U.S. economy at risk from higher oil prices ? <P> A : Right now there 's this accommodationist view of high oil prices . People are looking at global and U.S. growth and saying , " Well , these high prices are having less impact than might have been anticipated . " And it 's true that oil does not have as much leverage on our economy as it did in the ' 70s . We use half as much oil per unit of GDP as we did then . But when you have sustained prices of more than $50 a barrel , the economic impact will be larger than people have anticipated . <P> Q : Is it basically the China factor that 's keeping prices so high ? <P> A : Last year was the strongest oil-demand increase in a generation and the strongest economic growth in a generation . China 's oil demand grew 17% last year , or almost 1 million bbl. a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil that demand has grown by 1 million bbl. a day in a single country ; the last was in 1977 when the U.S. was coming out of recession . What we are seeing with China , and with India behind it , is analogous to the European economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s . A dozen years ago , China did n't even import oil . Today it is the second-largest oil market . What U.S. motorists are seeing at the pump reflects strong economic growth in China . <P> Q : Can China sustain that hot growth rate ? <P> A : People have been asking that question ever since the era of reform began there in 1980 . Yet China has continued to sustain 8% , 9% , 10% growth and even higher . Now they are trying to damp down the growth because they 're concerned about overinvestment and inflation . We should never assume things will continue in a straight line . But as long as China and India are experiencing a strong economic growth rate , that translates into higher oil demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this increased demand ? <P> A : When markets are this tight , all the OPEC countries can do is try to run and keep up . Almost all are producing at capacity . And higher prices reduce the urgency to encourage investment . We really need investment in new production capacity . We do see significant growth in non-OPEC production , in countries like Azerbaijan , Angola , Kazakhstan and Russia . The Saudis have indicated they will increase capacity about 20% in the next five years , which would be significant . <P> Q : Can Iraq become a factor ?
