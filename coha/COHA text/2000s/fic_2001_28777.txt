For euery man desyris naturally To leir and knaw and heir of novelt From Venice to Caffa , from Antwerp to the Gold Coast of Africa , merchants anchored their ships and unloaded their cannon and flipped open their ledgers as if in twenty years nothing had changed , and nothing was about to change now . As if old men did not die , or younger ones grow up , eventually . There was no fool in Europe , these days , who treated trade as a joke . All that sort were long sobered , or dead . Or were temporarily unavailable like Nicholas de Fleury , who had removed himself to the kingdom of Scotland , far to the north of the real world of pretty women , and international intrigue , and the benefits of social and financial success . North of the real world , it was noticed quite soon that Nicholas the Burgundian was back . The first to suffer was the bailie of Berwick , who had a house of three floors and good eyesight , so that he personally observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucking round into the mouth of the river . He held his breath until the manoeuvre was finished , for the Karel of Veere was the first merchantman to reach Scotland this season , and he had serious need of its news . When the harbour-bell clanged through the gale , Thomas Yare closed his shutters and sent a clerk pelting down to the wharf with an invitation to the Karel 's seamaster . Then he had a word with his wife , and strode down through the garden to the red-painted warehouse , where his business room was . Thomas Yare , an active Scot of burnished acuity , wished to entertain Mick Crackbene of the Karel before anyone else . Thomas Yare was bailie and chamberlain of the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed , and the River Tweed was the frontier with England , which meant that one did not bellow sensitive news , even now , in times of miraculous peace . Tom Yare was a native of these parts but , until recently , had earned most of his living in Edinburgh . That was because , until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between England and Scotland thirteen times since it was founded . Half its footloose population were spies , and the other half smugglers . So Yare wanted the big Scandinavian 's news for himself . He would get it . They had an understanding . Trade news was worth money . At whatever port they arrived , no matter how high the bribe , Crackbene 's men never talked . Unless , of course , first primed by Crackbene . Crackbene or one of the merchants he carried . You never knew who that might be . There were two with Crackbene today . Pouring ale in his office , Tom Yare heard the footsteps and doubled the number of tankards . When the door thundered back on its hinges and the red-faced master marched in , Yare winced , waved the pitcher in welcome , and then set it down to go forward , hand outstretched . Behind Crackbene was another robust figure of door-cracking capacity : Andro Wodman , the Scots-Flemish consul with his blue jowl and fighting-man 's shoulders and twice-broken nose , all of which Yare duly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed , heaven help us : so big his furzy brown head and soaked hat barely got past the lintel . Tom Yare dropped his welcoming hand and also released , very slightly , his business gentleman 's smooth-polished jaw as he set eyes on a man he had n't seen for four years . Nicholas de Fleury of Bruges . Ser Nicholas , do you mind : former banker , former dyemaster , former owner of armies , stepping over nice as a hen and unpeeling a soaked sailing-cloak to stand gazing down ( Tom Yare straightened ) with that bloody disarming smile and two dimples . They knew one another . The Burgundian had once made the bailie a very fine profit in cod . The first emotion felt by Tom Yare , and most others , upon meeting Nicol de Fleury , was an urge to be friendly . The next , based on experience , was a heady mixture of horror and glee . De Fleury said , ' Are you going to be sick ? ' Tom Yare , his face warming , recovered . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' I wish I had , ' said de Fleury . ' You might have managed something better than ale . Ale ? Business bad , Tom ? Wish you had firm news from somewhere ? ' It brought back immediately all that fascinated Yare about Nicol de Fleury , and all that he distrusted as well . ' Mick prefers ale , ' the Conservator observed , shaking wet from his bonnet . ' Nobody knew you were coming , Nicholas , with your luxurious Persian tastes . How are you , Tom ? ' ' Dumbfoun'ered , ' said Yare with unusual honesty . He opened the door , called an order , and shut it swiftly again . ' Have ye spoken to anyone yet ? ' Crackbene 's evil smile broadened . The consul , Wodman , said , ' What about ? ' De Fleury sat down on a coffer , which groaned . ' Ca n't you guess ? He wants to know if the siege of Nancy is over . It is . ' ' That 's old news , ' Wodman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Tom Yare did n't waste time being exasperated . He said , ' There has n't been a ship from the south since Epiphany . You 're the first . ' ' It 's a good ship , the Karel , ' said the Scandinavian shipmaster proudly . It was purgatory . ' But you must have had dispatches by road , ' Wodman said . ' Wardens ' runners . Envoys . Lawyers on business . Wenches with well-informed clients . After all , that 's England , over the river . ' ' I remember , ' said Yare . Men behaved like this , safely landed from sea . Nicol de Fleury behaved like this far too often . Tom Yare was a solid , fit man , but lodged between de Fleury and Crackbene he felt small and thumbed , like a rosary bead . He continued in his soft , deliberate voice , defying the burr in his speech that Margaret always said she found sweet . ' The roads rhodes have been closed , and the place is jumping with rumours . Wheat prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a disaster at Nancy , and the richest prince in the West is a corpse , with an unmarried lass as his heiress . True tehoo or not ? ' Someone tapped on the door . Wine came in , and was poured . No one spoke . When the door closed : ' The Duke of Burgundy is officially dead , ' de Fleury said , saluting the ceiling and drinking . ' I was there . That is n't a bad little Osey . ' ' Tell me , ' said Tom Yare . Then he listened to what he was given : the unemotional account of a disaster . The Grand Prince of the West had been discovered dumped dead in a ditch after a mindless battle with Swiss and Lorrainers . The news had taken a long time to spread . Before de Fleury left Flanders , he had had an audience with the widowed Dowager Duchess , and discussed the future with men of commitment like Gruuthuse , Hugonet and Adorne . For , of course , France would try to reclaim her borders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flanders at all . So there were implications . They discussed them . Wodman contributed : he had once been a soldier in France . By the end , Yare had grasped that de Fleury had actually taken part in the fight and been wounded . Most of his companions were dead . Some were captives about to be ransomed , among them two Scots : the gunner John , and that decent young merchant , Robin of Berecrofts , who had also been injured . Yare said , ' Was Robin hurt bad ? ' It was the business-man in him that spoke . The noble Anselm Adorne of Bruges bought and sold through his kindred in Scotland , and Robin had wed Adorne 's niece . A trading empire was involved . De Fleury said , ' I do n't know . He was shot . It looked serious enough at the time . ' Yare said , ' You 'll want to tell his eme and his father in Edinburgh . What else have ye in mind while you 're there ? ' He was entitled to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had closed all his ventures in Scotland and gone , abandoning the stripling Court which had befriended him . Now he was back , with a trading-ship which belonged to his wife . All the years de Fleury was absent , his wife Gelis had successfully run a good business , as you would expect of a van Borselen of Veere . She had an eight-year-old son by her husband . Tom Yare 's own sharp-witted wife admired her acumen , but not what she had heard of her casual marriage . Yare thought de Fleury ( in this respect only ) a fool . Yare also admired Gelis van Borselen , who was still at home in Bruges and , it seemed , abandoned again . He had met other husbands like this . Men who could sail , but not navigate . De Fleury had n't mentioned his wife , except in the context of business . Nor did he now . He said , ' I thought I 'd see what was happening . I suppose I 'd better report what I 've told you . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yare said , ' They 'll want you to stay . ' ' They ? ' said de Fleury . ' The King . The Council . The merchants . It depends whom you plan to see first . ' He let a pause develop unhindered . De Fleury said , ' Perhaps I should ask your advice about that . As you said , it is sensitive news , and incautious handling could cause damage . ' Yare said , ' What have you heard ? ' Wodman glanced at his fellow passenger , but said nothing . De Fleury said , ' Only what reached Bruges before the end of the year . The King 's brothers and sisters are young , and occasionally wilful . Sometimes merchants and even envoys find it better to speak first to the older men of the Council , who can then choose the right time to debate the issue with King James or his brothers . But I may have heard wrongly . ' ' No , ' said Yare . He was aware that he had been spared an explanation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berwick , but he was also one of the small circle - Scheves , the Prestons , the Sinclairs - who supplied personal service to the royal household ; whose ships brought in baby night coats and wine-barrels and salmon , while some of their houses in Edinburgh were grand enough to lodge envoys . He heard a lot of personal gossip and , of course , used it . But he was careful to whom he imparted it . Now he said , ' What you heard is true . It is a young Court , as you say . The Duke of Burgundy 's death raises complex issues that the King 's advisers will want to consider . ' ' So that perhaps I should see them initially , ' de Fleury said . ' But if the King summons me first , there is not much I can do . ' ' No , ' said Yare . ' Once he knows that you 've landed , that is . But you could be sorely held up . It 's a bad beat sometimes , north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we all know , ca n't set a course . Yes , that 's true , ' de Fleury said , lifting a brow at his shipmaster . ' If you say so , ' the big fair man said blandly . And to Yare : ' I did n't tell you . We 've brought your tombstones . Lovely , they are . One for you , one for your lady . Come and see when we get them ashore . ' He promised . As the talk turned to more everyday channels , it occurred to Tom Yare that there was a piece of gossip he should give to Nicol de Fleury . Something heard by Yare 's brother the friar , who lived near the Priory that taught the King 's youngest sister in Haddington . He would tell de Fleury , in private . Back on board : ' He did n't notice the chip in the marble , ' Nicholas said . The ship heaved . Wodman said , ' He was n't really thinking of tombstones . He was trying to work out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he send the news to ? The guilds ? ' The ship pitched . Nicholas said , ' Christ , Mick : you have rigged the sails badly . No . The guilds will come second . First , he 'll send to the Lords Three . ' They both knew whom he meant . Avandale , Whitelaw and Argyll led the inner council that supported the King . That supported young James and his little wife and the four royal brothers and sisters about whom Tom Yare knew so much that was disquieting . Mick Crackbene said , ' You mean he 'll send to the Council , who will then tell the King that the Duke of Burgundy 's dead , and suggest what to do about it ? Is that what Yare told you ? ' And Nicholas answered , ' As good as . You heard him . ' He wished sometimes that Mick were less observant . For many years , the shipmaster had worked , off and on , for Nicholas de Fleury , and sometimes against him , as Wodman had done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed by Crackbene , had been for no one but Nicholas himself . Yare had given him news -- no , a piece of scandal , which Nicholas was compelled to believe , however unwillingly . He would have to deal with it personally : there was nobody else . But first , he had a weightier errand : to report to the policy-makers of Scotland the facts of the Duke of Burgundy 's death . He did not know how long all that would take , or when he could set in train what he had come for , which was not to pick up a cargo . He was not , in fact , perfectly fit ; but that would mend . His injuries had been nothing to Robin 's . Landing in Berwick that wild , February day , Nicholas de Fleury had known that he was mad to come back to Scotland , but that it had to be done . And since he had made a computation , as he always did , of all the possible risks , he concluded that the two parties who intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hope to have some sport with him first . In which he was wrong . With the co-operation of the weather , it was not hard to arrive tardily at the harbour for Edinburgh , and Nicholas was unsurprised , knowing Tom Yare , to find nobody there but a few unfamiliar harbour- and customs men , who dealt solely with Crackbene , and showed no interest in identifying his patron or passengers . Although it was mid-afternoon , the sky was dim with rain-clouds , and a blustering wind scoured the puddles and seethed over the sandbanks , and collided in spume with the jetties . Officially , they were to stay aboard , with their cargo , until morning . Unofficially , it was conveyed that two persons might land if they wished . Which let Nicholas take Wodman to Edinburgh . It was only two miles from Leith . Someone hired him a couple of hacks , in a port where once he had had his own stables and lodging . Crackbene 's wife stayed in Leith with their children : he did n't know where . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these streets . Now he and Wodman rode out muffled in scarves , leaving the ship to toss in the gloom of the river-mouth . He had sympathy for the crew , but relied on Crackbene to preserve the fiction that no one had landed . Presumably the harbourmen knew to keep silent . He wondered whether the Council or the Abbot had arranged it , and who would come to escort them to their rendezvous ; for obviously someone must come . To arrive unprimed at the portals of Edinburgh would defeat the object of all this performance . Once recognised , he could hardly withhold his news , whatever damage it did . Out of Leith , the road was a mess . All the land to the north of the river was under the jurisdiction of Archibald Crawford , Abbot of the most important monastery in Edinburgh . The Abbey of Holyroodhouse lay at the foot of the hill on which the King 's castle was perched . The town clung to the steep spine between them . He knew every house , every lane in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He meant to come back , but had done so . Chilled and sore and battered by violent sailing , Nicholas was suddenly positive that he was right to be here ; seized by a kind of hope not incompatible with the lunatic joy that he had forced himself to leave . Now he knew what he wanted , and had resolved to bring it about . He meant to succeed . They had chosen the western , riverside route to the town , because it kept to the Holyrood bailery , and touched the busy hamlet of Bonnington , which led to the Canongate , and was tenanted by yet other Crawfords . Also , being longer , the way was less apt to be plagued like the Easter Road , with wealthy pack-trains , or ox-wagons stuck in the mud , or by common contingents on foot , rolling their kegs or dragging their sledges of merchandise . Their chosen path was mostly used by pedestrians , who kept clear of mud-throwing hooves and did not look up as they trudged . To the right was the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service buildings close by , on the rising ground where the thatched cottages huddled . On the left , the ground was rough and uneven , and rose in humps and hillocks towards the high town ahead , with a steep hill between . There were crofts there as well , each with a beaten yard and some hens and a kailpatch among dug-up anonymous workings , or parcels of rough grass and whin and low trees . Nicholas knew what it all was or had been . It had once been his business , and it might be so again , depending on what happened now . He said , ' What d' you think ? I expected someone to collect us by now . ' The rain had begun , but the sky was no lighter . ' We 're going too fast , ' Wodman said . ' We could get to Bonnington and stop at a tavern . You could do with a rest . ' ' You stop at a tavern , ' said Nicholas . ' If you think you can drink through your scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmassy Karel , and not spreading good tidings just yet . If you 're desperate , I have a flask . ' ' I 'm desperate , ' Wodman said . ' You would n't have any food ? ' In France , he had been a royal Archer , and they were all hearty drinkers and trenchermen . Turned merchant , he made a good , conscientious Conservator , who just happened to know some dangerous people . Nicholas handed over the flask , and dropped his horse 's gait to a saunter . The rain rustled down . There was no one on the road at the moment , and nothing to attract anyone either . Between themselves and the river , there were three wattle cabins with smoke drooping down from the heather and childish voices disputing inside . The noise drowned , at first , another sound from behind them , which gradually emerged : he automatically identified it . Allah-u akbar , la ilaha illa'llah ; the afternoon summons to prayer . No , of course not : wrong country . Women , singing . Fisherfolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise . Allah-u akbar . Wodman took his mouth from the flask . ' I heard it , ' Nicholas said . ' Do you really want food ? ' ' I do n't think so , ' said Andro Wodman . The warbling voices were clearer and closer , and there was a rumbling basso beneath . ' Unless they 're selling bowls of seethed meat with onions . What are they selling ? ' They had both turned and stopped to look back . Toiling up the rise was a group of sturdy young people , their faces bright in the rain , hauling sledges behind them . Walled sledges , crowded with hampers . The wind was from the east . Even without that , you could tell what was in them . ' What about oysters ? ' Nicholas said . Wodman handed over the flask and jumped down before he did . There were three sledges , each with two fellows hauling and another couple striding behind . The girls rode with the creels , singing and holding them steady . The men wore skin caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . The women were hooded and bundled in hessian and stopped singing as they came up . One of the men delved in a creel and came forward , his hollow hands weighted and dripping . The oysters in them were the finest Nicholas had ever seen : the sensitive shells , thin as a porcelain roseleaf , slowly closed as he watched . ' They like to be serenaded , ' the man observed . ' If you will sing to them , they would surely re-open , my lord . ' Nicholas laughed a little , for the voice was educated , and the discreet device to attract them was plain . A clerk , a servant of Church or of state , had at last arrived to collect them . The girls , who remained crouched with the creels , were no doubt genuine . Wodman had realised it also . Dismounting , amused , he was accepting the gift with bravura . Nicholas gathered his reins to do likewise . The same well-spoken man smiled , and stepped round to help him , still speaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The something was naked steel , flashing from under the felt and driving expertly upwards . It was so fast that only instinct could help . As Nicholas swerved , he shouted to Wodman . They had n't indulged in an escort , but they were n't crazy enough to have come on this ride unprotected . The swordpoint bit into his cloak and grated across the cuirass underneath , bringing the swordsman close for a moment , his face blank with surprise . Nicholas kicked him under the chin , so that he blundered back and hit someone else while Nicholas dragged out his own sword . The horse was n't his , but it was a powerful beast and alarmed enough to be ready to rear . Nicholas wrapped the reins round one wrist and hauled , using the bit to drag the horse threshing on to its haunches , and then allowing it to plunge forward kicking again . It could n't last very long , but at least he did n't fall off , and enjoyed the whistling sound his blade made as he slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oystermen mobbed him . He could hear Wodman making loud breathless noises , but could n't see him , which meant he had n't managed to remount . He tried to steer towards him , but it was like jousting in a cone of molasses . Too many men . And he was not at his best . It was now very noisy , with a lot of shouting and cursing and the flat sound of steel against steel from his blade and Andro 's . All their assailants seemed to have weapons . There were three less than there had been : two fell back , bloodied , and someone was screaming continuously . Far from summoning help , the uproar had probably frightened off every traveller for miles . Jolting about in the saddle , fending off the blows to his legs and his horse and the inventive characters who wished to mount up behind him , Nicholas kept track of the sound of Wodman 's swordplay , and heard his yell of triumph as someone was spitted . He had never fought beside Wodman before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered if Wodman were wishing he had n't come . He fell off , finally , because they stabbed the horse under him and he was n't expecting it , this being an action profoundly alien to professional robbers . His horse was n't wearing a cuirass . Nicholas hurled himself off as it staggered , with his sword in one hand and the wine-flask in the other , unstoppered . One man got the force of his shoulder , and two others the remaining wine full in the face while he located where Wodman was and crashed into him , back to back . Wodman said , ' About time . ' He was covered with blood , but his sparse teeth gleamed : he was happy . They had been about fifteen to two . Fewer , if you left out the girls , screaming , crouched in the sledges . A lot fewer now , when you reckoned the men on all fours in the road , and even one who looked dead . Say eight to two . It was worrying , for the fact was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first man had certainly meant to disable him , but no one had tried to do more -- and with those odds , and his shortcomings , it should have been easy . So it was n't a personal matter . Not handsome David de Salmeton , and his private grudges . Not a minion of the St Pol family , which had thrown de Salmeton out of its business , but shared his hatred of Nicholas de Fleury . Just someone who wanted a ransom , and assumed he was rich , and worth a lot more than a horse . Or perhaps he was n't the target at all . He said , panting , ' Have you bedded anyone you should n't have lately ? ' ' I was trying to remember , ' Wodman said . He was slowing . If they could get to the cabins . . . They could n't hide in the cabins . There were children there . They were being forced towards the cabins . Their assailants wanted them there . They were going to be killed , but at leisure . Wodman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Any suggestions ? ' It emerged in gasps , for his strength had suddenly gone , and he had no reserves . His limbs belonged to somebody else , and one eye was shut , he trusted not permanently . With mixed hope and dread , he caught sight of a flash from the cabins : one of the low doors had opened , and men were running out , carrying weapons . Several men . Enough almost to balance the odds . Wodman said , ' Oh deary dear . ' And it was Oh deary dear . The newcomers hurtled straight to the sledgers and joined them . Nicholas was cross enough to try quite hard to kill one or more , but this time he had no real strength , and neither had Wodman . In the end there was too much against them , and it finished quite soon . They were disarmed and flung on the ground , their cuirasses shed , while someone brought rope-lengths to bind them . One or two others embarked on a kicking , which he unwisely resisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stopped by a new voice , very gentle , speaking half in English , half in a language Nicholas de Fleury had known all his life . ' Mais non ! ' it said . ' You must not let them die yet . Foolish men ! There is no hope of rescue . Who will interfere in a fisher-feud ? Everyone knows the mettle of oystermen ; how those who own the scalps of Inchkeith will fight the dredgers of Musselburgh . The men who walk this path later will find broken sledges , and blood , and two wayfarers who became sadly embroiled in the dispute . But they will never , of course , find the oystermen . ' The French was irreproachable , with an accent as familiar to him as his own , although it was not Burgundian . The speaker was one of the girls from the sledge , cloaked and hooded in hessian over a fine gown of green . He could not see her face . He could not speak . Wodman said , ' You did n't even fight , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we die with honour at least . ' He spoke in English , so that all the others could hear . Nicholas used English also . Sitting stiff with his bound hands before him , he sustained the gaze of the invisible face with his one unbloodied eye and spoke in a clear , level voice . ' You have planned well , but not well enough . There are men coming to meet us who will not be deterred by a fight , but will feel it their duty to stop it . Also , Andro Wodman is a royal official , Conservator of Scots Privileges in Bruges and the King 's familiar squire . The King will not rest until his killer is found . ' ' In which case , ' said the girl , ' the deed had better be done indoors . ' ' But not by you , ' Nicholas said . ' You devised this , but others will hang . What will you do when the bailie or the King 's men arrive ? Are there horses for everyone ? Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One man had glanced at another . Their momentum was failing . Nicholas addressed the girl evenly . ' There is my sword . Kill me yourself . ' Wodman growled . Even the sodden ground beneath him seemed to stir with unease . The rain stuttered on the uneven group round about them , and on those who had left it , unbidden , to search out the dead and the wounded . The other girls had all gone . One of the girl 's henchmen looked up . A single horseman was racing towards them ; not by the road but crosswise , over the hillocks . He was shouting a warning . Nicholas said , ' The bailie 's men are coming . I told you . ' The ground was vibrating . It was obvious that he was speaking the truth , even before the outrider arrived . The girl said , ' Get the horses . ' So the mounts had been concealed in advance . As he had said , it had all been well enough planned . If you had resources , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed . She had picked up the sword . She had capable hands . Wodman said , ' Damn you . If she kills you , she 's got to kill me as well . ' ' But that would be an injustice , ' Nicholas said . She had come to stand at his side . The sword , gripped in both hands , reflected into her face , which was swathed to the cheekbones under the hood . All he could see were her eyes , fringed , wide and lovely . All he could hear in his mind was her soft , husky voice . Nicholas said , ' I could have killed you , but I did n't . ' ' Because you are a coward , ' she said . ' Which I am not . ' And slowly raised her arms holding the sword . Nicholas kept his eyes open , upon her . Kept his single eye open . It seemed fitting that , at this , the ultimate moment of his preposterous life , he should be staring one-eyed at his killer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke . He was probably about to meet Astorre in Hell , and be lectured into eternity about military privies and pasties and women . She might not have time to kill Wodman . She did n't have time for anything . Her own hired leader , now mounted , had lingered . As she gripped and aligned the sword , the man swore and flung his horse back towards her . She turned , swinging the sword , but he avoided it . Instead , stooping , he grasped her and swept her aside , so that the sword fell and she was pulled away screeching at his flank . He bent and hauled her up into the saddle , and then spurred off , fast , after the others . They took the way towards Edinburgh . The man was not a philanthropist : he simply did n't intend to be named by some frightened employer . A moment later , the bailie 's horsemen breasted the rise and slowed and stared , as well they might , at the trampled mud , the cottages with their imprisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nicol de Fleury trussed and half stripped and blood-stained at their feet . The bailie said , ' My lords ! What has happened ? The Abbot expects you ! ' Nicholas said thinly , ' A case of mistaken identity . You saved us . A little salve and fresh clothing , and we shall not disappoint the Abbot , I hope . ' Every bone ached . He avoided looking at Wodman . Wodman maintained a welcome silence all the time they were being untied , and Nicholas was blocking auxiliary questions , and inventing explanations as they occurred to him . They were given horses and cloaks and some temporary patching , until the bailie 's own household could tend them . The Abbey Farm of Broughtonwas not very far . In public , Wodman did n't utter a word . Wodman was forty , and could pass for being exhausted . In private , he waited until they were riding together . Then he said , ' It was n't a girl . ' ' No , ' said Nicholas , whose digestive organs were obeying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one . He tried to kill me in Cyprus , and I let him escape . Did n't you recognise him , your old colleague David de Salmeton ? You would have , when he flung back his cloak in that hut . ' He did n't have to explain . Wodman knew why Nicholas had come back to Scotland , and had promised to help him . To track down some gold . To end a family feud . To kill a man who meant to kill him . A French-speaking one-tone royal Archer called David de Salmeton . Wodman said , ' You thought he would n't attack to begin with . You thought he would play with you first . ' ' I was wrong , ' Nicholas said . ' But you did n't denounce him to the bailie ? ' Nicholas said , ' What , without any proof ? Could you swear that was David de Salmeton ? ' There was a long pause . ' No , ' said Wodman . ' No . And neither could I. But now I am warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't all loss . ' ' No ? ' said Wodman . ' No . They 're bringing the sledges . Are you hungry ? ' Nicholas said . He knew , without looking at Wodman , that the words they had just exchanged were like the steps in a dance : a formality . For him , they were bleaker than that . He was watching the sledges jump and slew at the heels of the horses , their creels roused to a silvery rattle , their spillings dancing from timber to timber and sprinkling the unwinding roadway like rose-leaves . Or like the living creatures they were , male and female at once ; lust and tenderness embraced in one heart ; each now shut and alone in its shell , because the singing had stopped .
