Making the Landscape Your Own Employing loose , interpretative brushstrokes and masterly color-mixing , this Midwestern oil painter captures scenes of delicate beauty . <p> When he finds a scene that interests him , Minnesota artist Reid P. Galey takes only a few minutes to get out of his car , set up his pochade box on a tripod , affix a prepared panel , and begin painting with his oils . Although in the past he has worked very literally , now he lays in his main shapes rapidly , ignoring wind gusts and subsequent changes in light as he creates his interpretation of the beauty he sees . His task , as he puts it , is " to express things in paint that are too subtle for words . " <p> Galey has always viewed the world artistically and found ways to work creatively . While still in high school , he had a profitable ceramics production studio , but eventually became tired of making repetitive , functional pieces . " The love just was n't there , " he explains . Looking for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of college and then later at the University of New Mexico , in Albuquerque , where he graduated with bachelor 's degrees in art education , history , and social studies . While accepting commissions to paint murals and illustrations , he also explored various techniques and means of expression , including airbrush and trompe l'oeil . Even as he was teaching in New Mexico at junior high and high schools , he continued to work in ceramics until he suffered a back injury , which put him in a full-body cast , preventing him from using a potter 's wheel during his long recovery . This was the push he needed to pursue painting full time . <p> Galey is essentially self-taught , but took workshops with such noted plein air painters as Kevin MacPherson , John Budicin , and Scott Christensen to develop his skills . Through those classes he discovered his love for plein air landscape painting . " It 's a great office to work in , and the overhead 's low , " he says with a grin . " But what I really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site itself . Hot sun , bugs , wind , whatever . I like to have all my senses going at once . The more you paint outdoors , the easier it gets to recognize the values and colors you see . " <p> To begin a painting , Galey usually works on an untoned surface , establishing his drawing with a brush and then adding impressionistic strokes of lights and darks . " After that , I just jump into it , working over the whole canvas , " says the artist . He adds that one of his goals is to keep the viewer focused on the painting by creating " paths " for the eye to travel , back and around . " There 's no right way to start  --  it 's just personal preference , " he notes , stressing that he encourages his workshop students to find their individual voice and own way of expressing their feelings in paint . " I want students to paint in their own style , but I can help them hone their skills . " <p> During the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wool clothes , a hat , insulated boots , and wool gloves with the fingertips cut out . But when it gets so cold that even the paints are freezing , he would rather not face the elements . " I 'm not that courageous , " he says . " In brutal weather , I 'll take a lot of photos and work from those and my field studies back in the studio . I do n't always like painting from photographs , but with six months of winter , artists should have a huge library to refer to , because we ca n't always go outside . " <p> Galey often has more than one studio painting in progress at a time and builds frames to complement his pieces . His studio palette is a large sheet of glass set over a neutral gray ground . When outdoors , he prefers his well-used Open Box M pochade box with a wooden palette . It has a built-up patina from years of painting and scraping down the residue afterward . " The oils that get into the wood pores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palette range , however , whether indoors or out , is the same . Galey notes that with the fine variety of colors and brands to choose from , he experiments a lot , and sometimes even grinds his own pigments . Since some colors that he favors may be available only from certain manufacturers , he works with many brands , but relies primarily on Utrecht , Winsor &; Newton , and some Holbein colors , never using a pigment straight from the tube . He mixes brilliant green with alizarin crimson to get what he describes as " the blackest black  --  and it can add warmth in the darks , " he adds . " I like to see color in the shadows , and I love reflected light . " A combination of alizarin crimson with a small amount of cadmium yellow pale makes what the artist considers the best orange . However , depending on the scene , he sometimes uses cadmium red light or cadmium orange . <p> Other colors that Galey includes in his palette are ultramarine blue , cobalt blue pale , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , occasionally he adds yellow ochre to his autumn palette . For darker yellows , he adds red and a bit of blue to cadmium yellow pale . On the rare occasion he uses cerulean blue , he mixes it with an orange to gray the color or to get a warm green that 's not too strong . He uses jaune brilliant , a lead-based soft yellow , for modifying some colors . " It 's very forgiving , " the artist explains . " It does n't overpower other colors , and I can mix it with a lot of lights or darks . " <p> Grays are an important component to any plein air artist 's palette , and Galey believes grays should always have color , becoming , for example , green-grays or perhaps red-grays . " If you 're sensitive to the grays , and if you mix them with other colors , your palette does n't get away from you , " he advises . He notes that grays can produce a desirable unity , with colors relating to one another in a painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he warns , " so mastering the grays is important . Mixing them can get mechanical . Some artists get so comfortable with a combination that has been successful that they stick with it , using the same formula over and over instead of experimenting and trying to grow . " Galey likes to mix his colors spontaneously . If he feels he is getting complacent with his colors , he limits himself to a palette of just the primaries and white . <p> Once his palette is set , choosing color to represent a particular landscape becomes a challenge . Sometimes he puts down a very light lavender or pink tone for a winter scene , so that it 's not pure white . In First Snow at Warm Springs , he points out slight touches of yellow , violet , and blue in the whites . " The ice has a reflective quality from the atmosphere above , and some transparency as well , " Galey explains . " I really love winter paintings because I can be very delicate but also bold . It 's a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really see , and what the value is . " <p> Galey always strives to put down the values correctly in relation to one another , and he strongly states the large main shapes , keeping other elements secondary to simplify the process . " It 's important to remember who the main actors are in the painting , " he declares . " You have to make sure that the subordinate characters are not overpowering  --  that they do n't steal the show . " <p> In A View From the Rim , for instance , which was done from a sketch and a photograph , the artist employs strong contrasts of value and color . " The colors in the shadows in the Grand Canyon are just mind-boggling , " he exclaims . " I wanted to subordinate the background , to keep the focus on the bright light and reflected light up front . " In these large foreground shapes , he used a lot of oranges , reds , and even ochres ; his darks were established with violets , dark oranges , blues , and grays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges and colors . " It 's a very warm piece , " he says , " and even though we know the shadows are cool , they appear on the warmer side . I think rocks are one of the hardest objects to paint well . If you remember that a change of plane means a change in value , you 've got half the battle won . " <p> Although Galey admires artists who have the patience for watercolor , he works exclusively in oils . " Oil is difficult , but it 's also very forgiving , " he says . " I used to work with a variety of painting mediums , but if I forgot to mix the medium in some of my paint , I would get some glossy spots and some dull ones . " Now he uses only turpentine or paint thinner . For sizes up to 16 ? x 20 ? , he prefers Masonite panels , which he prepares with two coats of Fredrix ready-to-use oil primer . For larger paintings , he favors oil-primed linen canvas . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some of the commercially prepared panels are just terrible . The paint slides off like Vaseline . " <p> A good-humored , engaging young man who enjoys entertaining people , Galey remarks that he is not a temperamental painter . " And I 'm not bulletproof , " he confesses with a smile . " I can create bad paintings just as quickly as good ones . " When that happens , he studies the failed painting , asking himself why it did n't work . " I discover something every time I paint , " he says . " Monet , until the day he died , said he learned something new daily . I love that . " <p> Other artists who have influenced Galey include Edgar Payne , for his beautifully designed compositions , and Carl Rungius , known mostly for his wildlife paintings but admired , Galey says , " for his spontaneity and brush-work and how he simplifies so much . " He also loves Joaquin Sorolla for the great looseness he achieved with brushstrokes . " I really admire painters who are very decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they put it on with authority , as opposed to just noodling , " he asserts . " If you have a strong concept and you push forward , or if you work at it and it shows the rhythm , then it also shows how much you trust yourself . " <p> To Galey , having fun while painting is of utmost importance , and he wishes all artists would feel the same . " But my motto is that art is a difficult pleasure , " he concedes . " Degas once said , ' Painting is easy when you do n't know how , but difficult when you do . ' I 'd like to grow as a painter , to be the best I can be  --  but it does n't come without a lot of hard work . " <p> Galey is represented in Minnesota by Art Resources Gallery in St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Edina , and also by the Water Street Gallery in Saugatuck , Michigan , which is presenting a solo exhibition of the artist 's work on September 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On September 15 , the artist is hosting a weeklong plein air workshop in Cody , Wyoming , on the 7D Ranch .

I captured it very loosely , with some quick foreground gestures .
