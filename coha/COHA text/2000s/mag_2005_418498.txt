In this excerpt from a riveting new novel by best-selling author Bebe Moore Campbell , a mother confronts her daughter 's frightening mental chaos // in the beginning , it was like being suspicious of a husband . Those little pinprick inklings tickled the inside of my skull . I explained everything away until I could n't . The reason he was gone all the time was because he was working ; the reason she talked so fast was because she was excitable , emotional . The reason he did n't reach for me at night was because he was tired from working so hard . The reason she could n't sleep at night was because she was so wound up from studying . None of her old friends came around anymore because , well , people outgrow each other . The silence at the dinner table , the quiet in our bedroom-he was preoccupied with his work . All the speeding tickets ? Did n't all young people speed ? The spending sprees ? That was my fault . I never should have let Trina have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His silences grew deeper . How could she say those things ? Baby , what 's going on ? Trina , what 's wrong ? Years before , Clyde had told me , " There 's nobody else ; there 's just no us . " With Trina I drew my own conclusions : My child is sick . I waded through quicksand to get to those words . It was up to my neck when I finally spoke them aloud . " Your daughter is bipolar , also known as manic-depressive , " the doctor at the second hospital had told me . That was at UCLA , last August , a week before she was scheduled to leave for Brown University . I had taken Trina there after she began telling me that I was a devil who had stolen her from her real mother . I sat with her in admittance and told the clerk that my child needed psychiatric care . I whispered the words but they came out of my mouth all the same . The woman checked our insurance , and then she found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . When I returned the next day I demanded a psychological evaluation . The UCLA doctor was Russian , his accent thick . His words bewildered me . I asked him to repeat what he 'd said . " Ms. Whitmore , your daughter is bipolar . " Photograph // That was the scariest part , the way he said it . She is bipolar , not she has bipolar . You are cancer . You are AIDS . Nobody ever said that . " How long before she gets better ? " " Woman , " the doctor said , not unkindly , " do n't set your clock . " I thought about the time I 'd almost had her hospitalized during the Christmas break when she was in the eleventh grade , but for drugs , not psychosis . My ex-boyfriend and I had returned from the movies . When we drove up to my house , every light was turned on and music was blaring . Inside I found Trina wearing one of my cocktail dresses . Her face was a garish rainbow-silver eye shadow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing for the door . " Whoa , " I said . " Where do you think you 're going ? " " You ca n't stop me , Demon Queen . " She began screaming , and when I listened to what she was saying-calling me a devil , accusing me of killing her real mother , themes she would return to again and again-I became alarmed . My exboyfriend and I tried to settle her down . " What are you on ? " I asked her over and over . Her answer was more screaming and cursing . Ex-Boyfriend and I drove her straight to the hospital , but when the attendant suggested that her problem might be mental , I balked . " My daughter does n't have a mental problem , " I told him . By that lime Trina had calmed down so much that when the emergency-room physician said that he did n't see anything wrong , I was ready to believe him . Keep an eye on her for the next 48 hours , he told me . On the way back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't taken anything , explained that she had n't been sleeping well because she was studying so hard for midterms . It was a plausible excuse ; that 's what I told myself . That episode was but a foreshadowing of the **26;2219;TOOLONG episode that landed her in UCLA . That night in August she seemed to be floating on a jet stream of hallucinatory energy that punctuated her every word . Around four o'clock that morning I awoke to her footsteps , kitchen-cabinet doors slamming shut , music playing in her room , television voices that were way too loud . She began calling people on the telephone and had dozens of disjointed conversations , one right after another , as though she were frightened of being without a connection . Later there were soft thuds as she ran down the back stairs into the kitchen , then more slamming , shutting , opening of drawers , cabinets , the refrigerator . After a while I smelled food . When I came downstairs , I found ten cold pancakes , lopsided from syrup and butter , piled on a plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room . The light on her phone did n't go out for more than two minutes . That light mesmerized and terrorized , like a whip dangling fromMassa 's hand . I was in the kitchen with Ex-Boyfriend when she came down the back stairs that evening . It was Saturday . I had called her father but I could n't locate him . So Ex-Boyfriend came . We were sitting at my kitchen table , and I was describing Trina 's behavior . " Baby , " he said , as gently as he could , " it sounds like crack or maybe meth . " Hearing my worst suspicions voiced by another , I began to cry . Then we heard the clicking of high heels on the stairs . Minutes before she appeared , the room became filled with the odor of perfume ; it was way too much of a good thing . Not a good sign . About nine o'clock and she was going out . Not a good plan . It was Mom 's job to try to stop her . Trina had on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , underneath , a black bra I 'd never seen before . But what really took my breath away was her war paint . Her pretty mouth was a slash of iridescent white . The lids of her large , clear eyes were smeared with bright green . Brick-colored blush accented her high cheekbones . She had shaved off her eyebrows and penciled in two black half moons . There were splashes of pink spray paint in her hair . He 's right , I thought . Ex-Boyfriend took my hand . " Give me your leather coat , " she called from the steps . Different strategies and ensuing scenarios collided in my mind . But all the well-planned words would result in yelling and screaming , and by that time I 'd begun to be afraid of where arguing might lead . " No , " I said weakly , managing to add , " Where do you think you 're going looking like that ? " I got up from the table and walked over to the bottom of the stairs . " I 'm going to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into medical school . " " What people ? " She ignored me . " Trina , have you looked in the mirror ? " " Why do n't you look in the f-ing mirror sometimes ? " She rushed down the last steps and in an instant we were nose to nose on the bottom step . " You 're such a bitch , " she hissed . " Trina , you need to chill , babygirl , " Ex-Boyfriend said . " You 're not my father . " Ex-Boyfriend stood up . " Maybe you 'd better go , " I told him . " No , she 's on something . I 'm not leaving you with her , " he said . He just stood there at the table . I could feel Trina 's breath on my face , see the flames rioting in her eyes . That 's when I knew that she wanted to hurt me . That 's when I knew that what was wrong was soul-deep and strong as chains . What was wrong was n't drugs . What was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , as I sat in Dr. Ustinov 's office trying to connect all the dots , my mind grew clogged , and there were blanks in my memory . When did she catch this brain flu ? Was it in tenth grade when her best friend moved away ? Was it in eleventh grade when her sweetie broke her heart ? Or earlier ? When we uprooted her from Atlanta ? When her father left ? What was the trauma ? Had someone 's hands touched her in the wrong place ? Was I too critical , too much of a perfectionist , too busy working to pay enough attention ? I began to cry and Dr. Ustinov handed me a tissue . " Listen , Mother , it 's not about reasons . It 's about medication . This runs in families , like diabetes or high blood pressure . This is mostly genetic . " " Or bad parenting . " I began weeping . Dr. Ustinov leaned across his desk and brought his face close to mine . " This is not clear thinking , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a broomstick for the slightest infraction . I am damaged , but I am not mentally ill because I 'm not genetically predisposed to this sort of disease . Did you give her this illness ? No . Be careful , Mother , you will make yourself sick . Your daughter can have a good life , even with this . Do n't blame yourself . " Ha ! Is n't it always Mommy 's fault ? Mom did n't do this ; she did n't do that . She nursed too long . She bottle-fed . She slapped the s-1 out of the kid . She spoiled the brat . She was too dumb and too lazy to get a job . She worked full-time and never paid attention . She weighed 300 pounds and waddled into school for open house ; she weighed 110 and always showed too much cleavage . She traded Dad in for a lesbian lover ; she stayed with a husband who beat her and set a poor example ; she left the fool and broke up the family . Worse yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her boyfriends spend the night ; she did n't provide a male role model for her kids . She never cleaned ; she screamed when the little ones tracked in mud . She let her children run wild and had herself a good ole time . Her child was drowning , and she did n't save her . // Motherless child ; childless mother . God was doing His stand-up routine again .
