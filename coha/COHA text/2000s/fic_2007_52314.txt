PATTY PECCAVI SITS ON THE EDGE of the unmade bed , staring out the window into the headlight of the sun . She has already put on her glasses , horn-rims she uses when alone-her contacts are for work-and she has her bra halfway on as she looks into the headlight that has pinned her accusingly to her bed . By the time she is through hitching her breasts into the bra , the sun has shifted slightly upwards , and Patty Peccavi stands up to pull on her underpants , cotton and full-size . Patty Peccavi once had another life , in the infield , her father tells his cronies as he hangs over his beer in the bar closest to the assisted living home he 's been put into . But now she 's in Africa somewhere-he waves his hand vaguely as if pointing to a map-vaccinating people , a nurse . She 's given him this computer so he can receive her e-mails and photos she sends , but it 's not the same thing , is it ? Half the time he loses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , excited , sad , angry with herself for missing this or that ; that 's when she was in the game , got into the papers-she sent him clippings-but now , well , here he is , is n't he , and when she came to see him the last time , he hardly recognized her , his slender girl this stern , heavy-breasted matron . He could n't get his breath , they had to give him oxygen . Talk about cruel fate ! Luckily her mother passed on before it happened , she would never have survived the shock . He wishes he had died , too , and his drinking companions , also red-rimmed and gaunt , go Yeah , them , too ; but since they 're all feeling rather festive over their despair , they have another round . Patty Peccavi is not thinking about her father because she is not guilty , and no matter how much the headlight is pointed at her , exposing her flesh that with age has expanded and spotted , she will not admit wrong . She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career moves , wrong choices at wrong times . She makes up her bed efficiently-she 's a nurse , after all-puts away her nightclothes in the suitcase she likes to use as a chest of drawers , and goes into the second room of the two-room concrete house she lives in , and prepares tea . Her house worker has left herfufu , which she eats cold with her hand . Then she finishes dressing , puts in her contacts , and goes out , locking her door with its series of chains , not that it makes much of a difference . It is ten past seven . Hand-over at the hospital is exactly at seven-thirty , and Patty Peccavi will be there . Patty has always been on time . You do n't go far without discipline , her dad would say , waking her at 5:00 AM so she could run and work out before school . In five minutes Patty Peccavi will walk down the steps from her small house , which is but one of seven in the enclosed Muslim compound where she lives-as a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the compound where she will find her zemidjahn waiting . Here , getting on the back of the motorcycle with her old-fashioned satchel and her laptop , she will be carried off by the moto 's owner , Jean-no one has last names they care to give her-to the hospital down by the lagoon . Jean is paid the equivalent of three dollars for the daily round trip ; sometimes he must wait for Ia blanche in the evening , but his pay is more than most drivers make zooming around their twelve-hour days , so he lounges and flirts with the girls as he buys them instant coffee with condensed milk served in the coffee stalls lining the dirt road . His moto sags when Patty Peccavi hoists herself onto the back part of the rubberized pommel they share , but like all his older , heavier female customers coming home with their black plastic bags from the market , she maintains a certain grace as she wedges her parcels against him . " a va ? " he asks , to which , formulaically , she replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off . In the old days Patty Peccavi could fly off the earth for a catch , her left , mitted hand extended to the heavens , her grasp as delicate and as wide as God 's Himself , and the ball , drawn by longing and love would reverse course and plop right into her glove like Noah 's dove coming home . Though her father did n't say exactly that , it 's what he meant when he saw his daughter make one of her leaps , his heart bursting with pride . If he had had any sense , he says weeping into his beer , he should have died right then and there at that very moment , a happy man , for never was there to be a sight like that again . At the hospital , a perfunctory modern two-story building built by the French in the 19705 with concrete one-story buildings added later in the rear joined by arcades as need expanded , Patty Peccavi goes to the auditorium 's la salle d'enfance , where hand-over takes place , the night staff reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new problems ; and Patty Peccavi , who only did two years of French at her community college , listens passively , for whatever the language , the problems and patients are always the same , and in a pinch , everyone knows basic English anyway . Patty Peccavi runs the new AIDS clinic , or at least that 's what her nonprofit has hired her to do , but she can also deliver babies , give injections , and resuscitate the dead , the latter attested to by several patients who swear they were dying when Patty Peccavi reached down and dragged them up from l'enfer . Trussed chickens and fresh eggs are left anonymously at her door out of respect for her powers , the same gifts given to the local jujus . Today Patty Peccavi is taking a day off from her clinic duties because she 's doing a survey on condom use among different working male populations of her Calavi-Ganvie district . Her office off the courtyard in the rear of the hospital will be open as usual , but she wo n't be there . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cordonniers today . In the old days all the shoe people wanted his darling daughter to wear their shoes , Patty Peccavi 's father tells his poker group as they sit around a back table shuffling chips and cards amidst glasses , bottles , and candy bar wrappers . They all wanted a piece of her , he says , pushing a stack across the table , but she stuck with Reebok although the big bucks were even then with Nike . Not that the money was like today , when she could have been a gazillionaire . He ca n't remember why it all came unstuck-they paid something , not that much , but still she bought him and her mother a new car , a Cadillac , not one of those foreign things , but a Cadillac , that was the car then , white sports model with red seats , Brougham or something they called it , her mom tickled pink even though she was the one always worrying about when their Patty was going to get married . As Patty Peccavi walks ahead of Aimee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost white sky , meaning the heat will probably reach 100 degrees and it is not yet nine in the morning . They are off the main road and the dust is everywhere , so Patty Peccavi takes out her contacts and puts on her glasses . Their informant , Soule , has also been up since six preparing for work by polishing his boots , which have the toe areas cut away because they 're too small for him . He sits on the outside stoop of his concrete room dealing with two customers . The left shoe sole of one has come off , so Soule glues it back on , then sews it to hold it fast . He charges CFAsub 50 or ten cents . The other is a woman with platform shoes with wooden heels . The toe cover is repaired for CFAsub 100 or twenty cents . Soule tries to make five dollars a day if he can . Aimee has lectured Patty Peccavi about the importance of footwear in local society . The line between poor and indigent is drawn over such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only beggars , mad people , and children go barefoot . Without shoes one can not show respect . Up north , in the presence of a chief , shoes must be removed before prostrating oneself . Patty Peccavi listens . She does not speak about shoes , her own shoes , the Reeboks she wears still , for they are sensible for work ; and she does not say , as her father would want to , that in the old days she 'd put on her Reeboks like people in fairy tales put on magic shoes and that once she had them on she could do anything-even with the sun rushing at her like a headlight , but it could n't throw her , nothing could . Better than lightning she was in the infield . " Allons ! " she does say after a while , and so Soule leads the way to where his colleagues also work , carrying his wooden kit filled with three different kinds of waxes with their three brushes , needles and thread , a little hammer and nails for repairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tok-tok , to announce his coming to those behind the compound walls . So they go , the tok-tokkers , Soule in front in open-toed boots , Aimee in flip-flops , and , following in her Reeboks , Patty Peccavi , who was once in the infield . Patty Peccavi , brought back from Africa , sits by the correctly made bed , her father 's head on two small pillows , his hands across his chest but under a crisply turned sheet and blanket that cut him off at the neck . He 's breathing stertorously , but is conscious . I guess this is it , he wheezes , your Dads getting off the train , 111 be seeing your mom soon . He does n't really believe this and Patty Peccavi knows he does n't and neither does she , but she pats the bedclothes above where his hands are . You 're going to be all right , she says briskly . You 've had a hip replacement , and after a couple of weeks of rehabilitation you should be good as new-which means , as Patty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways again , going to the corner bar , playing poker , getting drunk and having to go to the men 's room , where he will fall and break his other hip . He does n't even remember he was trying to piss when it happened . He thinks it happened when he was playing his hand of cards , best cards he 'd ever had , he tells her , although his friends say he only had a pair of eights ; there was a staggering sum of twenty dollars in the pot , and then someone knocked over his chair , and he must have had a heart attack or something . Patty Peccavi just listens , her large , strong , and still youthful-looking hand on the bedcovers , for she knows he 's going to come around to the time when he did have a heart attack , when in the old days he had felt his heart break , go crack , shatter like a mirror , does she remember that ? Don t get yourself worked up , Patty Peccavi says , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of the old days , March something it was-Remember that ? he asks-he 'll never forget that date , March something , she called to say she had quit training , was going away , was going to have a baby , he must n't come after her , he had to leave her alone . She hung up before he could say a word and he had a massive heart attack right then and there holding the telephone receiver but , speechless , he could n't say a word to anyone . He got up and had breakfast . He had n't said a word to her mom . He had n't said anything about the pain that tore his insides into fragments . He chewed his breakfast like he was eating glass , and even later when his wife asked what Patty had said , he did n't say anything . He just ate his eggs and toast and brushed his teeth and went to work as always . At work they called an ambulance , and he was in the hospital for six weeks . She came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due ? he asked weakly , for lying in bed he thought maybe it would be a boy and take after his Patty so he had to get strong for that . But she said straightforwardly , for she has always been straight with him and everyone , I 've had an abortion , Dad . He turned his head , he could not speak . She just sat there and he just lay there , both trapped forever , it seemed , until he began to think maybe it was for the best . He croaked weakly , You going back ? And she said maybe , and a stone rolled off his heart and he could see her in the infield again , him in the stands jumping up and down , and so it was for a while , and then she just disappeared . He does n't see her again until her mom dies . He hardly recognizes her , this large bulky woman , only her streaked blond hair still lopped behind her neck in a knot , coming toward him in women 's clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , she says , standing before him , waiting for him to make the first move , and out of respect for her mom , he does . She 's gone , he says , beginning to cry , and she says , I know , I know , Dad , I 'm sorry . I want to get off , too , he says . There 's no point staying on with your mom gone-what 's to become of me ? But he already has a girlfriend , so it 's all rhetorical , and after retooling , Patty Peccavi goes to Africa where she keeps in touch by e-mail . Now Patty Peccavi rests her hands over her father 's chest with all the scars . The girlfriends have long gone , and there 's just the old ladies in his assisted-living home . Can I come back with you ? he asks . It 's lonely here . You would n't like it , Dad , it 's real hot , replies Patty Peccavi . There 's a slight smile when she says this because she knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life except to her games , and even then he felt lost in a motel room . You 're doing good , her father says suddenly . I tell the boys how you 're vaccinating people who 've never had a chance , and Patty Peccavi puts a hand under the bedclothes and squeezes her father 's hand . She has n't told him she spends most of her time handing out condoms and showing men and women how they are to be used . It would break his heart . I 'll be back in a year , my contract ends then , Patty Peccavi says . Maybe we can get a place together-and her words hang out there , an offering , but her father looks away , feeling now threatened . You 've got your own life to lead , he says , the home 's not so bad . How old would he have been now ? he asks , and Patty Peccavi says , Let 's not go there , Dad . It had n't been a boy anyway , but a girl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her breaking his heart getting an abortion like that , still he 's in the stands jumping up and down when she comes back to the infield . Patty Peccavi gets up , leans over , and kisses her father 's sunken cheek gently . I 'll e-mail when I get back , she says . I 've hired that nursing aide you like to come help you with the computer once a week . And she leaves , striding off like she used to in the old days when she was mad with herself and the ball had n't left like a rocket , or when , leaping upward , her arms straight above her , she did n't bring down the stars , which is how her father tries to describe it to his buddies . She could have been the best , he says to them , to the silence left by her departure . She broke my heart , he adds melodramatically . And although all he 's had is a hip replacement , the heart of Patty Peccavi 's father does really break right then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train for good . Patty Peccavi sits on the edge of an unmade bed , staring out the window into the headlight of the sun . It is Id al-Adha , the Muslim feast of sacrifice , seventy days after Ramadan and twenty days since the funeral of her father whom she left in his hospital bed about to be released to the rehabilitation hospice but whose heart broke for the last time , as Patty Peccavi says to herself , but not ironically , for Patty Peccavi is long past irony . She says this to herself with a kind of steady weariness with which she has had to face the truth . She should have said she would bring him to Africa , even though she knew and he knew he never would have gone ; but thinking of going would have given him something to tell his cronies , something to keep his pecker up , as he called it , keep theirs up , too . It might have brought the sun in , firing them all with hope and desire that if he could go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she remembers their longing , his longing , his longing especially for the old days when he felt on top of the world , when he was the luckiest man alive , when he had the best daughter in the world , as he told everyone , the old days when he had a daughter in the infield . The heat of the day pins Patty Peccavi to the bed even though it is early morning , the muzzein long finished calling everyone to prayer , and outside the window is the sound of sheep munching from the pile of weeds heaped between the two posts to which the woolly animals are tethered . All week they have been fattened , and today an imam is coming over to slit their throats . They belong to her neighbor , Mr. Diarra , who not only gives her his last name but also gives her his card , on which is printed his full name and his business as " spcialiste electronique , " by which Patty Peccavi has come to understand that anything to do with electricity Mr. Diarra can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " secondhand " television set he says he has " found . " He lives in the compound with two grown sons and a teenage daughter who does all the housework while his wife or wives and other children are elsewhere- " l-bas " he says . They have an electronique shop which is " l-bas " too , but Mr. Diarra keeps many parts of cars , air conditioners , radios , and broken television sets in the compound . Patty Peccavi , who in the old days usually got what she wanted , does not want the sheep to be slaughtered . She has gotten used to them snuffling outside her window , and although she understands how if the sheep are n't sacrificed , God might take offense , she 's feeling he can make an exception here . I will give you money for them , twice what you paid , she says to Mr. Diarra in her best French . If she had brought back her father , he would not have wanted her to let the sheep die , she explains to Mr. Diarra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did die . C'est compliqu , she finally admits , and Mr. Diarra nods yes , it is complicated , he can see , for Ia blanche is not a person to make things easy for herself . She has refused his offer to hook her up to television , where they can get programs now from Mecca , or to bring in a land phone so she can use her computer at home . Instead , she takes it to work every day as if she does n't trust Mr. Diarra or the others in the compound , and this hurts all their feelings-not that she is n't right , things disappear all the time , but not by them . There are thieves all over the place who slip in if you just close your eyes for a moment , which is why there are charms all over the place and why children are told to be alert and chickens are told to squawk , while grandmothers cook outside watching all the time . Also la blanche , when asked , has said forthrightly she has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avorte because she had no husband and she had a job that did not allow her to be pregnant . That 's what happens in America , too , when you have no husband and a job which does n't like you to be pregnant . The women in the compound looked neither shocked nor surprised , for that is not their way , but now they tell their husbands that la blanche is ashamed and that is why she wants to spare the sheep , but the men say no , it is just a whim , caprice , white people get fous about animals , not that they do n't eat meat like everyone else , but only if they can buy it in a store in little packages covered with plastic , which wo n't remind them of animals . Les massacres animaux . Les blancs do n't like la realit . They do not see la visage of God everywhere . Patty Peccavi waits patiently for Mr. Diarra to arrive at un arrangement , for he always does . He has told her frankly that if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two more sheep , and that will cost her a great deal of money since there will not be many sheep left in the market because everyone sacrifices on this day of Abraham , the father of all mankind , which includes les blancs also like Patty Peccavi . Je comprends , says Patty Peccavi , for she can see the truth and knows she can not stop time and custom from making their wounds . She only wishes to spare these two sheep , although once she has done so , she will probably sell them at the market in the following weeks because she has no talent with sheep . But it is a gesture she feels she should make even if the reasons seem too compliqus for her to explain even to herself as she sits on the bed in the morning facing the headlight of the sun . And so in the afternoon the imam comes and slits the throat of the two newly bought sheep who , out of consideration for Patty Peccavi , have been tethered on the other side of Mr. Diarra 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground in one graceful movement , the knife severing the artery , the blood reverently collected , while on her side of the house her two sheep munch their diminishing feed unaware of the fate they have momentarily escaped and of her at the window , staring out at them . Happy Father 's Day early , says Patty Peccavi , then leaves her bedroom , goes out the front door with her baseball and mitt to play catch with the kids now all dressed up in new clothes in honor of this great holiday when everyone is to rejoice ; and she will leap into the air from the infield , her mitt making a graceful trajectory before it catches the shlump of the ball , and the grandmothers over their fires will smile and shrug .
