EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO , A JUDGE ORDERED MICROSOFT TO STOP ABUSING ITS MONOPOLY POWER . HAVE THINGS CHANGED FOR USERS SINCE THEN ? BY SCOTT SPANBAUER // WHEN THE DUST settled on the landmark Microsoft anti-trust case with an agreement intended to curb the company 's abuse of its operating system monopoly , PC users might have cautiously expected a kinder , gentler Microsoft . Eighteen months later , while some legal wrangling continues and Microsoft is under new attack abroad , the agreement seems to be achieving its objectives-though individual users may notice only small changes . True , Microsoft 's operating system and browser ( not to mention its office suite , which was not at issue in the lawsuit ) are still dominant-a situation that has some observers concerned about a Microsoft " monoculture " that has left most computers , and even the Internet , vulnerable to well-designed attacks such as those by last year 's Sobig worm and this year 's Mydoom virus . // Although ongoing security problems with Microsoft 's products have long since grabbed the spotlight from the lawsuit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to squash competitors-the settlement agreement does appear to have changed Microsoft 's business behavior . Rivals in key areas-notably media players , e-mail , instant messaging , and Internet search-are holding their own against their Windows counterparts . Google , for instance , has a 40 percent share of the search market , compared with 30 percent for MSN Search ( see " Microsoft and Competitors " ) . The antitrust ruling also prohibits Windows licensing schemes that make it costly for PC vendors to install operating systems other than Windows on every computer they sell-but this has n't boosted the overall percentage of desktop computers running Linux ( Windows ' chief competitor ) , a number that continues to hover at around 3 percent . FUTURE PRODUCTS BUT THE question remains : Will the 2002 ruling keep the software giant in check ? Many of the categories in which Microsoft has failed to gain dominance-handheld PCs , game consoles , personal finance , and Internet connectivity , for example-involve products not directly bundled with Windows . It 's therefore perhaps not surprising that Microsoft 's new ventures may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to beef up search capabilities in future versions of Windows , and last year it purchased Romanian antivirus software company GeCAD . Search and antivirus tools are big business in today 's online world , but Microsoft says it has learned its lesson : Its future products will fully comply with the antitrust settlement-in these areas and others-and it will not use its operating system ubiquity to put existing search engines and antivirus vendors out of business . // MlCROSOFT AND COMPETITORS // Not everybody buys Microsoft 's story . In January , Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly 's office filed a brief , warning that Microsoft could be planning a " campaign against various Internet search engines similar to the campaign it previously waged against Netscape 's Navigator browser . " MALCONTi-NTS MASSACHUSETTS remains the only state that 's actively fighting to overturn judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly 's final judgment and the settlement , which took effect more than a year ago . Court-mandated reports filed since then show that Microsoft and the plaintiffs-the U.S. Department of justice and a consortium of 20 states-have settled into a routine of review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's products and licensing policies . Still , Massachusetts , foreign governments , and some competitors continue to press for stronger sanctions against the operating system monopoly . Microsoft faces other challenges . The European Commission declared in mid2003 that it might force Microsoft to yank Windows Media Player from Windows XP because Media Player allegedly competes unfairly with products from RealNetworks , Apple , and others . Then in December 2003 RealNetworks filed its own suit against Microsoft , claiming that the software giant used its monopoly power to try to control the digital-media market . And on a third front , Japanese authorities recently raided Microsoft offices in Tokyo in a search for evidence of unfair contracts with Japanese hardware makers . As to fears that Microsoft will monopolize Internet search , Microsoft spokesperson Jim Desler says that current plans for upcoming versions of Windows focus on improving local PC searching , rather than on Internet searching . " We are dedicating the resources and committing the energy and time to make sure that we are fully compliant with the settlement agreement , " Desler adds . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . CHECKING UP PART OF THE settlement agreement called for the creation of a review panel involving all parties to the suit to make sure Microsoft does not engage in the abusive business practices that sustained its monopoly power . It 's this group that files the court reports revealing the ongoing process of complaint , investigation , and changes in Microsoft products and policies ( see find.pcworld.com/41567 ) . Most recently , for example , Microsoft agreed to change a Windows Media Player music-shopping feature that persisted in launching Windows ' Internet Explorer browser , even when the user had set another program as the default browser . For Windows XP users , the most visible evidence of the settlement may be in the Set Program Access and Defaults interface that Service Pack 1 added to the Control Panel 's Add or Remove Programs tools . This interface lets users and system vendors dictate what browser , e-mail program , media player , and instant messaging client the operating system will use-either Microsoft 's own , or those from other software vendors . The tool can also make Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underlying code remains installed ) . " The consent decree has given Microsoft 's competitors some breathing room and relief , " says Laura DiDio , an analyst with the Yankee Group . But aside from the possibility of Microsoft offering rebates ( see " Get Your Money Back From Microsoft , " below ) or incentives for choosing its software , individual customers are not likely to see tangible impact from the settlement , she adds . DiDio believes the antitrust decision has led , indirectly , to larger discounts on Microsoft volume software licenses , notably in the small-business-oriented Open License program . But she doubts that individual Windows buyers in the U.S. and Canada will see discounts . DiDio suspects the European Commission 's pursuit of Microsoft may be " a bit of a witch hunt " stemming from anti-American sentiment related to the war in Iraq . The Europeans could require Microsoft to bundle other browsers or media players with its software-a remedy that might be onerous for Microsoft , but no big deal to Windows users , many of whom already routinely use more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have slowed erosion in the competitive landscape ; at the least it 's given Windows users more control over default apps . But Windows remains the personal computer 's dominant operating system . And for most of us , its dominance has meant coping with Windows security problems that the settlement was never intended to address-or even could . It 's a problem that only Microsoft can solve .
