Section : ForbesLife THE ADVENTURER A sweaty mass of humanity makes the pilgrimage to the top of Mount Fuji in summer . Better to climb it off-season  --  more challenging , and more serene <p> The oldest collection of Japanese poetry , published in the 8th century ( Manyoshu ) , calls Mount Fuji " a God mysterious . " So deeply ingrained is the mountain in the spiritual , social and artistic life of Japan that every year in July and August an estimated 200,000 people climb it . By then most of the winter 's snow has melted off the peak  --  the highest in Japan  --  and the ascent requires neither skill nor technical equipment . It 's so easy that many make the climb at night , to see sunrise from the summit . <p> On July 1 every year two religious groups  --  one on the north side ( Fuji-ko , which started pilgrimages in the 16th century ) and one on the south side ( Shugendo , a combination of Shinto and Buddhism )  --  celebrate the beginning of the climbing season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , are viewed as being unlucky to ascend . Not so Fuji . The more often one ascends , the better . Some devotees have been to the top 100 times . There 's an annual marathon up and down it each July . And Dentsu , the giant advertising agency , requires its employees to climb Fuji as a condition of employment . It 's a tradition dating back 77 years , intended to promote employee solidarity and teamwork . <p> My preference was to ascend in the off-season , when you can enjoy peace and solitude . Though I 've climbed higher peaks ( including the Matterhorn , Kilimanjaro and South America 's tallest , Aconcagua , at 23,000 feet ) , little Fuji ( 12,388feet ) holds a special place in my heart . I was born in Tokyo . My father was stationed with the U.S. Army at nearby Camp Drake during the post-WWII occupation of Japan , managing the Post Exchange where American servicemen shopped . I do n't remember much of that , other than an occasional glimpse of Fuji , looming large when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posited that the majesty of this vision seduced me into my present-day need to climb ever higher . If I surmounted Fuji , she insinuated , I might also surmount my obsession . <p> Because spring snows are deep , I 'd need crampons ( spikes strapped onto my boots for greater traction ) , an ice ax , ropes and , most importantly , a guide . <p> I contacted a Japanese guide service and was told that May would be a good month to try  --  after the severity of winter but before the June rainy season . While Fuji is generally not considered a dangerous peak , a few climbers perish every year from high winds , exposure and falls . The biggest risk in May is avalanches ; the week before I arrived , a climber died in one . ( There are also a number of suicides in the Aokigahara forest , at the base of Fuji  --  60 annually . ) <p> Just my luck , the rainy season came early . I had to wait ten days until weather reports declared the peak safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , each starting from a different station  --  Gotenba , Kawaguchiko , Sabashiri and Fujinomiya . The Fujinomiya station , highest at 7,800 feet , is accessible by car , so I started there . From that point on , a marked trail takes you much of the remaining 4,588 vertical feet . <p> Conditioning matters . You ascend from sea level to more than two vertical miles in less than 12 hours , so there is no time for acclimatization . At the summit the air has only two-thirds the oxygen it has at sea level . And from there , of course , you need the strength and reflexes to climb back down . <p> It is best to start the climb before 8 a.m. to take advantage of snow that is still hard enough for good cramponing and to avoid the afternoon thunderstorms that plague the mountain in spring . Your guide will know best how to avoid the avalanche-prone areas . He also provides the ropes , crampons and climbing harnesses . Kiyoshi Ikenouchi , an experienced mountaineer with several winter ascents of Fuji , charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the start a steep trail winds up a scree of broken volcanic rock . Because of the altitude , we went at a slow , steady pace , resting every 50 minutes for water and snacks . Sheltering huts ( or stations , as the Japanese call them ) are conveniently placed at regular intervals . <p> After four hours of huffing and puffing , we moved onto the snow and roped up , in case one of us slipped . We put on our crampons and pushed on . The thinner air began to get to me , as did the whipping , chilly wind . <p> Once we reached the crater rim ( Fuji is a dormant volcano that last erupted in 1708 ) we passed through a giant Japanese torii gate and arrived at the Fujishengen Shrine . In summer the place is open to the public for refreshments . One can even mail postcards  --  and hundreds of people at a time do . But not today . We saw at most six people during our entire climb . <p> We paused to rest , gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traverse of the crater rim into a snowy section with an inclination of 30 degrees . A slip here could be fatal . I tried hard to concentrate but felt light-headed from the thin air . <p> At the very top ( called Tsurugi-ga-mine ) a radar dome , a weather station and a grey-black granite obelisk stand guard . Below , a vast sea of cloud obscured the lower reaches of the mountain and all of Tokyo . Suddenly I felt alone in a country populated by 850 people per square mile . <p> From my pack I removed a cross my father wore until his death last year and an amber pendant my mother wore until hers in 2001 . For years I had been planning to give my parents , as their anniversary present , a trip back to Japan . But always I got sidetracked . Now I held their mementos and said a prayer . <p> Then it was time to descend . On the way down I wondered if having finally topped out on Fuji would dull my mountaineering yen , as my shrink had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from a friend asking if next year I 'd be interested in climbing Cho Oyu in Tibet , the world 's sixth-highest peak ( 26,906feet ) . I said , " Sign me up . " <p> So much for $300 an hour . <p> <p> For more Adventurer escapades , see **25;3049;TOOLONG . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Guides provide all gear , including harnesses . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Lower trail winds up broken , volcanic rock . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Approaching steep snow on the final pitch . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Fuji 's true top is marked by a granite obelisk . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By James M.
