<p> President Bush has begun a 31-day vacation in Crawford , Texas , evidently prompted by Confucius .

The job went to another firm , however , because Adarand was owned by whites , and its rival was owned by Hispanics . Adarand sued ; its case came to the Supreme Court , which asked the feds to retool their program to demonstrate a " compelling " government interest ; the retooling was done , and approved by a circuit court , and it will appear , on appeal , before the Supreme Court once again next term .

Those vetoes ca n't come soon enough . Discretionary spending was up 8.5 percent this year , with the non-defense portion of spending growing by 14 percent . Appropriations bills for next year are already well above Bush 's benchmark of a 4 percent increase . Congressman J. D. Hayworth ( R. , Ariz. ) , who rounded up the 150 House members committed to sustaining any veto , calls the pledges a " big stick behind the Oval Office door .

The Woodrow Wilson Center was the venue for the unveiling of the Daschle Doctrine . The Senate majority leader flayed Bush for not signing the Kyoto Protocol , and all the other agreements that liberals have decided are the measure of multilateralist maturity . Daschle admitted that " reasonable people can disagree about the merits " of these treaties , but ca n't " ignore the consequences of tearing up each one . " In other words , reasonable people who disagree with them should sign them anyway . Daschle " welcomed our European allies ' plans to increase their collective defensive capabilities " - that is , to devise an EU alternative to NATO . Daschle slapped Bush for reducing Russian-American relations " to a simple matter of trust between two leaders , " which is a good point , though Daschle did n't make it when Bill Clinton was bear-hugging Boris Yeltsin .

He will play the globalist and local ends against the national middle . Bush is forewarned . <p> <p> Senate Democrats have signaled their intention to " Gall " Otto Reich , a former Reagan official nominated to be Bush 's top Latin American diplomat . As Jay Nordlinger demonstrated recently in NR , the balance of the case against the Cuban-born Reich is that he was an anti-Communist back in the 1980s when it actually mattered . ( Now , of course , liberals tell us the battles of the Cold War were " simple " and " black-and-white .

The government may , however , soon have an opportunity to reconsider . Microsoft has just asked the Supreme Court to review the case . The Court has good reason to do so . An appeals court has already disqualified the trial judge , Thomas Penfield Jackson , because of his improper meetings with reporters . But the appeals court voided only his proposed remedy , not his findings of fact and law . Those findings were issued after the meetings began , and the decisions of other appeals courts in similar cases suggest that they should be voided too . The Supreme Court needs to step in to impose consistency on the law . That might mean a retrial in which another court makes new findings of fact , which could well turn out better for Microsoft than the technological speculation , theories , and errors that Judge Jackson called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retrial-and then Charles James should settle . <p> <p> During the late 1990s , Alan Greenspan seemed to obsess about the threat of " excess demand " and an " overheating economy . " Supply-siders argued that rather than setting targets for economic growth , the Federal Reserve should stick to maintaining price stability . The best guide to whether inflation was on the horizon , they further argued , could be found in market prices . Since the prices of raw materials and precious metals were slumping in 2000 , for example , they generally urged the Fed to loosen monetary policy rather than tighten it . The central bank , citing estimates that the economy was growing at a rapid 5-6 percent pace , tightened anyway . If the evidence of sluggish economic conditions all around us is not enough to demonstrate that Greenspan chose wrongly , we now have more evidence : It turns out that those growth figures were overestimated . The newly revised figures show that the economy grew by only 2.6 percent in 2000 . Government figures are backward-looking and subject to frequent revision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks for the Federal Reserve Board , President Bush should start appointing people who are willing to let markets guide the Fed rather than attempting the reverse . <p> <p> Bill Clinton got more than $10 million from Alfred A. Knopf , Inc. , for his memoirs , and anyone who squints at the price knows not the way of the world . Of course the publishing industry will pay ten very big ones for the confessions of Monica 's boytoy . And who is to say that Knopf will not earn back the advance ? American publishing has had a long love affair with trash . A huge 19th-century bestseller was The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk , the supposed autobiography of a woman who turned out to be mad , but who claimed to report on sex and abortions at a French-Canadian convent . One of the innovators of American publishing was Ned Buntline , pioneer of the Wild West dime novel , who was a drunken temperance lecturer and a fomenter of nativist riots on the side .

At last , the 42nd president may have found his true level . <p> <p> Republican governors running for reelection have had an easy time of it in recent years , but one of them-George Ryan of Illinois-announced on August 8 that he wo n't seek a second term in 2002 . Ryan 's poll numbers have sagged for months under the weight of a license-bribery scandal during his tenure as secretary of state . Many conservatives welcomed Ryan 's election three years ago , when he ran a conservative campaign . Since then , however , Ryan has drifted left : He placed a moratorium on the death penalty last year , vetoed a bill to restrict taxpayer funding of abortion , and spent part of this August pushing for expanded gay rights . He favors Lt. Gov . Corinne Wood , a socially liberal ticket-balancer , to succeed him on the grounds that she is " more moderate " than attorney general Jim Ryan , who is preparing to run . State senator Patrick O'Malley , also a capable conservative , is gearing up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primary and Wood becomes the nominee , the Democrats will have a unique opportunity to woo conservatives by advancing downstater Glenn Poshard , a pro-lifer who served in Congress before Ryan beat him in 1998 . Poshard has said he wo n't run again . If he changes his mind , though , perhaps conservatives should support him to save the Illinois GOP from itself . <p> <p> Another faltering Republican governor is Don Sundquist of Tennessee , who has tried to balance the state budget by imposing a new income tax on residents . Currently , Tennessee is one of just nine states that do n't demand a slice of everyone 's take-home pay-and big majorities in the legislature kept it that way in August by overriding the governor 's veto of their $19.6 billion budget . Sundquist was elected partly on his conservative record in the House of Representatives ; now he heads off into a term-limited netherland denouncing the legislature 's aversion to new taxes as " reckless disregard for our state 's future . " He sounds a lot like Al Gore-the last Tennessean to flop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to join the club Ryan and Sundquist soon will leave behind : former Jersey City mayor Bret Schundler , the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey . A principled conservative running in a famously liberal state , Schundler finds himself trailing Democratic nominee Jim McGreevey in the polls . One of Schundler 's strong points ( a firm grasp of intricate wonkery ) is simultaneously a weakness ( he can have trouble communicating with voters ) . What he needs is a galvanizing program on taxes , something more compelling than lifting the tolls on state highways , a praiseworthy idea that he has proposed . There is still plenty of time : Former governor Christine Whitman surged to victory on a tax-cut pledge announced relatively late in her first gubernatorial campaign eight years ago . In that respect at least , Schundler should be trying to follow in Whitman 's footsteps . Let the next comeback begin . <p> <p> Bowing to political pressure from the logging and sawmill industries , the Bush administration decided to impose a 19.3 percent tariff on softwood lumber imported from Canada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are n't Republicans supposed to oppose retroactive taxation ? Come to think of it , is n't President Bush supposed to be a free trader ? Bush 's lumber protectionism comes on the heels of moves to wall off steel imports . In both cases , he is helping a small industrial interest while raising costs to industries that employ far more workers . The administration 's off-the-record justification for these policies is that discrete acts of protectionism will buy congressional support for sweeping free-trade deals . But these policies also make it harder for America to negotiate those deals with other countries . What Bush is offering is new barriers now in return for the possibility of liberalization later . It 's not a good trade . <p> <p> Sure , sharks maul and kill people-but they are really just another fragile piece of the ecosystem . Or so goes the usual environmentalist line . " Humans are much more dangerous to sharks , which tend to end up in soup or medicine , " a Time magazine cover story recently reminded readers . This attitude has spawned a swath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has drastically cut into shark fishing . In Florida , where the vast majority of shark fishing occurs , more than 7.4 million lbs . of shark was hooked or netted off the coast in 1990 . By 1999 , the total catch had plummeted by more than 86 percent , to just over 1 million lbs . As Sean Paige , the Warren Brookes Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute , pointed out in a National Review Online piece , this trend just happens to coincide with another : In 1993 , there were 8 documented shark attacks in Florida ; last year , there were a record-high 34-including one known fatality-in state waters , representing a more than threefold jump . Nationally , attacks rose from 21 in 1993 to 51 last year . All of which suggests that humans may not be nearly dangerous enough to these fragile predators of the sea . <p> <p> The United States will pay China $34,567 for expenses it incurred after disabling our spy plane over the South China Sea in April .

So now we know Bush 's China policy : extortion payments on the cheap . <p> <p> Three years ago in these pages , Martin Sieff made the case for an alliance between India and the United States : With the Cold War over , the interests of these two democracies-in containing China , combatting Islamist radicalism , and ensuring the relatively free flow of oil in the Persian Gulf-increasingly converge . In recent months , both countries ' governments have been coming to appreciate this logic . The Bush administration 's latest overture is to propose lifting the sanctions that were imposed on India for testing nuclear weapons in 1998 , a step that would make military cooperation between the countries possible . It 's a wise decision . Sanctions on nuclear offenders have always been more of a gesture than an effective policy . A country that believes its security requires becoming a nuclear power is not likely to be deterred by mere sanctions . A serious policy against nuclear proliferation would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to reduce the incentive to go nuclear . That is the direction Bush is going . And no country has been more supportive of his drive toward missile defense than India . <p> <p> The Treaty of Nice , which will prepare the European Union for the entry of new members , most of them from eastern Europe , must be ratified by current EU members . Austria 's Freedom party , whose inclusion in that country 's governing coalition last year caused the EU to impose eight months of economic sanctions , is now demanding a popular referendum on this ratification , so that Austrians may make their views known . On hearing of this , Louis Michel of Belgium-the current EU president-gave vent to his feelings in the pure , authentic tones of the Eurocrat : " I personally think it is very dangerous to organize referendums when you 're not sure to win them If you organize a referendum and you lose the referendum , that 's a big problem for Europe Has a country the right to prevent the progress of Europe ?

Prayer may be the only way he can have an effect in the world to come . In this life , the people of Cambodia need the accounting the tribunal will provide . The Nazi leaders were tried at Nuremberg ; South Africa set up a Truth Commission . But Communists the world over have been conspicuously unpunished for their deeds ( in some countries , they still rule ) .

The point of the raid was to protect U.S. and British flights over Iraq , which are themselves pointless . In its half-measures and drift , the Clinton Iraq policy lives on in the Bush administration . Military history again and again has demonstrated the folly of allowing a defeated adversary to continue to feel aggrieved ( and therefore bent on revenge ) without ever actually finishing him off-a perfect description of U.S. strategy toward Saddam , going on a decade now . <p> <p> A year ago , Zimbabwean strongman Robert Mugabe sought to revive his political prospects , which were depressed by a limping economy , by launching a campaign against the nation 's white farmers .

General Assembly passed a resolution , promoted by the Arab bloc and backed by developing nations , equating Zionism with racism . Daniel P. Moynihan , then serving as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. , called the vote " obscene . " The U.S. boycotted two further U.N . conferences on race issues , in Geneva in 1978 and 1983 , because of the " Zionism = racism " resolution .

Moynihan had it right 26 years ago . <p> <p> Al Gore came back from his European vacation with a beard , and the commenting classes fell over themselves trying to divine the significance of this development . A popular theory was that the ex-veep , depressed at losing last November 's election , had put on weight and needed to conceal some jowliness . Others thought it was a play for attention ; yet others , that it was a sign of retreat into the mountain-man persona that lies beneath Al 's environmentalist enthusiasms .
