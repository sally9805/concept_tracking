Chapter One Whidbey Island , Washington 1894 " Do n't scream , or I 'll shoot , " warned a low-pitched voice . Leah Mundy jerked awake and found herself looking down the barrel of a gun . Sheer panic jolted her to full alert . " I 'm not going to scream , " she said , dry-mouthed . In her line of work she had learned to control fear . Lightning flickered , glancing off the dull blue finish of a Colt barrel . " Please do n't hurt me . " Her voice broke but did n't waver . " Lady , that 's up to you . Just do as you 're told , and nobody 'll get hurt . " Do as you 're told . Leah Mundy certainly had practice at that . " Who are you , " she asked , " and what do you want ? " " Who I am is the man holding this gun . What I want is Dr. Mundy . Sign outside says he lives here . " Thunder pulsed in the distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the waves of terror at bay as she blurted , " Dr. Mundy does live here . " " Well , go get him . " " I ca n't do that . " " Why not ? " She swallowed , trying to collect her wits , failing miserably . " He 's dead . He died three months ago . " " Sign says Dr. Mundy lives here . " Fury roughened the insistent voice . " The sign 's right . " Rain lashed the windowpanes . She squinted into the gloom . Beyond the gun , she could n't make out anything but the intruder 's dark shape . A loud snore drifted down the hall , and she glanced toward the noise . Think , think , think . Maybe she could alert one of the boarders . The gun barrel jabbed at her shoulder . " For chrissakes , woman , I do n't have time for guessing games - " " I 'm Dr. Mundy . " " What ? " " Dr. Leah Mundy . My father was also a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just me . " " Just you . " " Yes . " " And you 're a doctor . " " I am . " The large shape shifted impatiently . She caught the scents of rain and brine on him . Rain and brine from the sea and something else ... desperation . " You 'll have to do , then . Get your things , woman . You 're coming with me . " She jerked the covers up under her chin . " I beg your pardon . " " You 'll be begging for your sorry life if you do n't get a move on . " The threat in his voice struck like a whip . She did n't argue . Spending three years with her father back in Deadwood , South Dakota , had taught her to respect a threat issued by a man holding a gun . But she 'd never learned to respect the man himself . " Turn your back while I get dressed , " she said . " That 's pretty lame , even for a lady doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to turn my back . " " Any man who bullies unarmed people is a fool , " she snapped . " Funny thing about bullies , " he said calmly , using the nose of the Colt to ease the quilt down her body . " They pretty much always manage to get what they want . Now , move . " She yanked off the covers and shoved her feet into the sturdy boots she wore when making her calls . Island weather was wet in the springtime , and she 'd never been one to stand on high fashion . She wrapped herself in a robe , tugging the tie snugly around her waist . She tried to pretend this was an ordinary call on an ordinary night . Tried not to think about the fact that she had been yanked out of a sound sleep by a man with a gun . Damn him . How dare he ? " Are you ill ? " she asked the gunman . " Hell , no , I 'm not sick , " he said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hesitation took the edge off her anger . Another thing she 'd learned about bullies - they almost always acted out of fear . " I 'll need to stop in the surgery , get some things . " " Where 's the surgery ? " " Downstairs , adjacent to the kitchen . " She pushed open the door , daring to flash one look down the hall . Mr. Battle Douglas was a light sleeper , but despite his name , he would n't know the first thing to do about an armed intruder . Adam Armstrong , the newcomer , probably would , but for all she knew , the handsome timber merchant could be in league with the gunman . Aunt Leafy would only dissolve into hysterics , and Perpetua had her young son to consider . As for old Zeke Pomfrit , he 'd likely grab his ancient rifle and join her abductor . The gunman jabbed the Colt into her ribs . " Lady , do n't go doing anything foolish . " Leah surrendered the urge to rouse the household . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at risk . " You may call me Dr. Mundy , " she said over her shoulder . Her hand slipped down the banister as she made her way to the foyer . The man wore a long , cloaked duster that billowed out as he descended , sprinkling rainwater on the carpet runner . " You 're not a lady ? " he whispered , his mouth far too close to her ear . His voice had a curious raw edge to it . " Not to you . " She led the way along a hall to the darkened surgery . In the immaculate suite that occupied the south wing of the house , she lit a lamp . Her hands shook as she fumbled with a match , and her anger renewed itself . As the blue- white flame hissed to life , she turned to study her captor . She noted a fringe of wet hair the color of straw , lean cheeks chapped by the wind and stubbled by a few days ' growth of beard . An old scar on the ridge of his cheekbone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see his eyes . " What sort of ailment will I be treating ? " she asked . " Hell , I do n't know . You claim you 're the doctor . " Leah told herself she should be hardened to doubt and derision by now . But some things she never got used to . Like someone - even a dangerous man hiding behind a gun - thinking gender had anything at all to do with the ability to heal people . " What are the symptoms ? " She lifted the flap of her brown leather medical bag , checking the contents . Capped vials of feverfew , quinine , digitalis , carbolic acid disinfectant . Morphine crystals and chloroform . Instruments for extracting teeth and suppurating wounds . A stethoscope and clinical thermometer sterilized in bichloride of mercury , and a hypodermic syringe for injecting medicines into the bloodstream . " The symptoms ? " she prompted . " I guess ... fever . Stomach cramps . Babbling and such . Wheezing and coughing , too . " " Coughing blood ? " Leah asked sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any number of things , including the dreaded scourge , diphtheria . She tucked in some vials of muriate of ammonia , then took her oiled canvas slicker from a hook on the back of the door . " I 'm ready , " she said . " And I might add that forcing me at gunpoint is n't necessary . It 's my calling to heal people . If you want to put that away , I 'll still come . " He did n't put the gun away . Instead , he pushed the flap of his duster back to reveal a second gun . The holster - darkened with grease for quicker drawing - was strapped to a lean , denim-clad hip . The gun belt , slung low around a narrow waist , bore a supply of spare cartridges in the belt 's loops . Clearly , he was a man unused to being given what he asked for . He jerked the barrel toward the back door , motioning her ahead of him . ( Continues ... )        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
