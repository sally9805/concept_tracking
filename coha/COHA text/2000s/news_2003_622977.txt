<p> The NFL ultimately might remember the 2002 Raiders as champions , but for now , this is a crack team built on experience , poise and confidence . Oh yeah , and a fire-stoking measure of outrage . <p> Those visions of Chad Pennington sporting a Joe Namath fur coat , standing on Broadway and thumbing his 26-year-old nose at their obvious greatness ? " Well , I guess that brother just ran out of time , " smirked Jerry Porter , the Raiders ' deep-threat receiver who had 123 yards and a touchdown on six catches . " He 'll have to take off that fur coat , then , wo n't he ? " <p> Who knows if anyone mentioned a fur coat this week ? Who cares ? The Raiders ' utterly dominant 30-10 AFC divisional victory Sunday over Pennington 's New York Jets at a sold-out Coliseum had all the earmarks of a therapy session for the poor , woeful , disrespected Raiders who do n't read the papers but sure as heck know what they 're saying . <p> " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard Frank Middleton , ground zero all week for most of the unfriendly banter , " so I do n't know . But I hope he never had as bad a game as ( Pennington ) did . " <p> The love had gone New York 's way , or so the Raiders thought , and nobody in the country had a lick of regard for the AFC 's No. 1 seed , or so they believed . <p> The Raiders , after all , had turned away these Jets on Dec. 2 , and the postgame words of New York guard Dave Szott  --  " I think if you look at that game , we just ran out of time . It 's not like they clearly beat us , "  --  came back to haunt him Sunday . <p> " Well , OK . I think today 's ass-whipping was definitive enough , " declared Raiders All-Pro tackle Lincoln Kennedy , who usually is not given to such declarations of smack . <p> That was the stage , a combustible one that got heated early when the fired-up Jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out insults and snubs and fanning the inferno . " It 'd been building for a while , " Kennedy said , " and that just set everything off . " <p> The Jets , who go home with a 10-8 record and are 1-3 against the Raiders since last January , were profoundly beaten in every phase . " We made the adjustments that we needed to make , " said Raiders coach Bill Callahan , who had 15 days to break down the Jets ' tendencies and create a plan that worked . <p> The Raiders ' offense controlled the pace , pulling out every aspect of a balanced attack  --  the shallow passing scheme , the vertical game , power running and ball control  --  at opportune times . Quarterback Rich Gannon , the NFL 's Most Valuable Player , was at his most precise , carefully completing 20 of 30 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns . <p> The defense mirrored its midseason adjustment by returning to the basics at halftime , a powerful , harassing scheme that simply took Pennington  --  the NFL 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four turnovers were quickly crafted into 17 Raiders points . <p> " We put it man against man , " defensive tackle Sam Adams explained . " They were going to have to whup us to beat us . And they could n't do it . " <p> Even the oft-criticized special teams heeded the call , kicking away from dangerous return threats Chad Morton and Santana Moss and eliminating a key Jets menace . <p> So while there was well-earned bluster emanating from the Raiders ' side , and a prudent eye turned toward Sunday 's AFC Championship Game opponent , the Tennessee Titans , there also remains a perceptible sense that this job is n't finished . <p> " This was nice , but we 've got a big game next week , a big one . If we can get past that one , we 'll see what happens , " cautioned Raiders chief Al Davis , whose guarded optimism week by week through this roller-coaster season filtered down to his players , defining their character , regulating their passion . " These are the big games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> A taut first quarter , in which the Jets took a 3-0 lead on John Hall 's 38-yard field goal and then Sebastian Janikowski answered with a 29-yarder , ended with what would be a preview of things to come . <p> In the face of a rare Raiders blitz , Pennington stumbled on a 3rd-and-10 play at his own 20 , giving linebacker Travian Smith enough room to punch the ball loose and pounce on it . It was the first Jets turnover in their past four games , dating back to the 26-20 Raiders victory last month . <p> Six plays later , Zack Crockett 's 1-yard plunge pushed the Raiders ahead 10-3 with 13:44 remaining before halftime . When the Jets responded with a clock-eating , Curtis Martin-led drive capped by Pennington 's 1-yard pass to reserve fullback Jerald Sowell for a touchdown , a halftime revision was in order . <p> " Well , I tried to take a page after watching Chad Pennington play , " deadpanned Gannon , " and do the stuff he was doing . " <p> Or not . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Chad will tell you he did not have one of his better games , " Jets coach Herman Edwards conceded  --  Gannon and Co. were itching to air it out . <p> A Tory James interception midway through the third quarter set up the big show , Gannon to Porter , and the quarterback used a pump fake to freeze Jets free safety Damien Robinson in the " Cover-2 " zone  --  " 27-Pump " they called it  --  opening an end-zone path for the young wideout , and a 17-10 Raiders lead . <p> As the third quarter ended , the Raiders ( 12-5 ) went to a play that worked before against the Jets , a " high-low go " that isolated Porter again against a late-arriving Robinson in a " Cover-3 " zone . It was a stunning 50-yard completion and the Raiders capitalized with a 9-yard scoring pass to Jerry Rice on the second play of the final quarter . <p> Even a comical flurry of mutual turnovers  --  three in 47 seconds  --  early in the fourth quarter could n't shake the Raiders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season and we 've proved that it wo n't get to us , " guard Mo Collins said . " A lot of teams thought we were one-dimensional on offense , that we could n't play defense . We showed everybody today what we 're made of .
