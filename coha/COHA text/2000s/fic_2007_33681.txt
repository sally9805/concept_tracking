The Hanged Man 3 March 1618 Her hands looked unnaturally pale in the moonlight . For a moment , Alessandra forgot the bitter wind that kicked up an icy spray off the lagoon , and regarded her hands as though they belonged to someone else : a conspicuous ridge of bone-white knuckle , with pallid veins that were faintly visible through milky flesh . As they approached the Ponte San Biagio , she realized how tense she was , how tightly she gripped the edge of the gondola . Calm yourself , she thought , and released her grasp . You must be calm . She reclined against the seat cushions , assuming a relaxed posture she did not feel , and the coarse fabric of her costume bunched uncomfortably against her back . She chose to ignore it . If Nico sees that you are uneasy , he will insist that you return home .

The houses along both sides were shuttered and dark . They would remain that way until morning , while the inhabitants celebrated elsewhere : in thePiazza , in the smaller public squares , in the palaces along the Grand Canal . The end of Carnival was only three days away . After weeks of celebration , the revelry had built to a frenzy , as in the tale of a bewitched princess who danced for days and nights without rest . When morning dawned on Ash Wednesday , fragile and silver fogged , all of Venice would fall into a limitless sleep , as if under an enchantment . They turned into the Rio di San Martino , then into a narrow waterway that circled west toward the Piazzetta dei Leoncini . In their wake , small waves gently slapped against stone foundations smothered in clumps of thick , glistening moss . She could reach out and brush the damp stone with her fingertips if she desired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar grotto scent with a kind of reverence . Traveling through Venice at night always filled her with a rising excitement , but tonight her anticipation was tinged with fear . Alessandra tried not to think about what waited for her at the end of her journey , which was quickly approaching . Already she could hear strains of music . Then came an indeterminate cry  --  of fear , passion , or laughter ?  --  that echoed off stone walls and was abruptly silenced , leaving once again the oar 's rhythmic squeak and splash . Soon there appeared a harbinger of the celebration at the city 's center : a single gondola with a red lantern at its bow glided slowly toward them . Seated within it were two velvet-breeched men wearing the masks of pagan gods , and two elegant courtesans with feathered headdresses that resembled exotic birds , whose ruby lips and bejeweled throats gleamed in the rosy light . As the gondola passed , these fantastic creatures turned to regard her with a languid curiosity ; then one of the strange , hybrid women wet her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silent invitation . Alessandra felt as if she were merely a spectator at a passing show . Then she and Nico were swallowed by the shadow of a bridge and disgorged again , and all at once they were enveloped by music and light and laughter , a riot of color and strange costume , as the crowds along Calle Canonica pressed into the Piazza . Nico halted the gondola and exchanged a wordless look with Alessandra before she stepped onto the fondamenta and rushed away . The Piazza was bright with torchlight , alive with music and revelry , but she could not join the general high spirits ; the sinister maw that waited for her in the dark courtyard of the Doge 's Palace filled her with dread . The bocca di leone , the lion 's mouth , was a special receptacle created by the Venetian government to receive letters of denunciation . Into this bronze plaque went accusations of theft , murder , or tax evasion  --  the last a particularly heinous crime according to the Great Council , the Republic 's ruling assembly of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she would ever avail herself of it . Behind the bocca di leone 's grotesque , gaping mouth lurked every terror hidden within the depths of the palace , the prison , and the Republic itself ; surely unleashing that terror was a fearsome act not to be done with indifference . As she pushed her way through the crowds , she was aware of the letter tucked inside the small purse tied at her waist . It bore both her personal seal and her signature . The Great Council paid no heed to anonymous letters , to discourage using the bocca di leone as a way of striking at one 's enemies . Soon the marquis and his coconspirators would know who had exposed their plan , and her life would be in danger . But how could she do other than what she had set out to do tonight ? The Republic was in peril . It was her civic duty to place the letter in the lion 's mouth , to set the wheels of justice in motion . If she failed , more lives than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage and moved toward the Porta della Carta , the dark archway that led to the palace courtyard , then abruptly stopped , startled by something that had caught at the edge of her vision . Between the two great marble columns at the foot of the Piazzetta , a dead man hung limply against a background of starless sky . His limbs were broken , his face bloodied , his bruised flesh barely covered by dirty , tattered rags . Although he was suspended on a gibbet directly above the gaming tables that crowded the space between the two columns , not one of the many costumed revelers below took notice of him . Stirred by a gust of wind , the hanged man turned slowly on the cord that had snapped his neck . Light from a bonfire below animated his blank , staring eyes ; flickering shadows played across his mouth and turned his death 's grimace into a grin . Alessandra stood transfixed , as it appeared that the hanged man was still alive . She imagined that he spoke to her , his warning delivered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of this rope , if you do not deliver that letter ... but here is the fate of the one you love if you do . I am damned with the Devil 's own choice , Alessandra thought , but as for the one I love ... she looked again at the hanged man , and it was suddenly clear that all life had left him . Just a body at the end of a rope , no more , no less , not common , but not uncommon , either . She had seen hanged men before in this very place ; she knew well they did not speak . She shook her head to rid herself of the apparition and turned away . The sooner she got on with her task and was away , the better . As for the one she loved ... well , he did not love her , did he ? Still , her step was slow as she walked toward the Porta della Carta . The Devil 's own choice , she thought , and slipped through the archway into the shadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Venice was past the apogee of its empire , " Claire Donovan said as she shuffled an index card to the bottom of the stack , resisting an urge to fan herself with it . The Harriot Historical Society meeting room felt stiflingly hot . From her position at the podium , Claire saw that her audience was also suffering from the unseasonably warm weather . Program notes doubled as fans , and handkerchiefs were dabbed at brows and throats . " Although the Republic was still a major power , it was surrounded by enemies : the Turkish Empire , France , and , most notably , Spain , the richest and most powerful country in the western world , and the dominant force in Italy . Italy was not the united country we know today , but a disparate group of territorial states , many of them under Spanish control , ruled by a Spanish viceroy or governor . The Venetian Republic stood alone in its independence ; along with its fabled wealth and beauty , this vulnerability only served to tantalize those determined to conquer her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after assuming the viceroyalty of Milan in 1616 , " she continued . " But he knew he could not take the Republic on his own . He enlisted the help of the Spanish ambassador , the marquis of Bedmar ... " She paused , distracted , as a bead of perspiration slid down her neck and underneath her collar . God , she was hot . It did n't help that she 'd dressed up for the occasion of her first public lecture , exchanging her usual T-shirt and khakis for a skirt , blazer , and blouse ; or that her long , fawn-colored hair was hanging loose instead of tied back into a neat , and much cooler , braid . She glanced at her notes on the 1618 Spanish Conspiracy against Venice , trying to regain her place and her rhythm . " The marquis of Bedmar , " she began again , then stopped as she heard a soft , wheezing whisper from somewhere in the audience . It was followed by the creak of metal folding chairs , the rustle of bodies , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enraptured , Claire realized , feeling a sudden flush of self-consciousness . One instant her thoughts had been on her scribbled notes , the words in her mind , and the images she envisioned : seventeenth-century Venice , Alessandra Rossetti on her fateful trip to the bocca di leone . The next instant she was just someone standing in front of a small group of people she hardly knew , feeling much too hot and not quite sure of what she was doing . This did n't bode well for her future success . If she could n't give a captivating talk to the members of the Harriot Historical Society , how would she ever present her doctoral dissertation to her adviser , the notoriously caustic Claudius Hilliard , and the rest of the Harvard committee who would watch her with judgmental , silent stares ? She took a sip of water from the plastic cup on the podium and looked up from her index cards . Elroy Dugan was fast asleep , but the other audience members still seemed interested . They were all women , all well over seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with expressions of encouraging expectation . Maybe her lecture was n't going quite as badly as she 'd imagined . Claire smiled at them and brushed the perspiration from her brow . " The marquis of Bedmar , Spanish ambassador to Venice ... " she said , her voice trailing off . Odd . Her notes were blurry . Her ears suddenly seemed to be stuffed with cotton . Her legs felt shaky , her head woozy . She gripped the sides of the podium to steady herself . In the front row , Mrs. Branford Biddle , the historical society 's director , leaned forward , looking concerned . " Venice ... , " Claire began once more , and wondered why Mrs. Biddle seemed to be lunging straight at her . " Miss Donovan . " A woman was speaking to her . Why could n't she answer ? " Miss Donovan , please stick out your tongue . " It seemed an odd but perfectly reasonable request , so she complied . Claire not only heard but felt someone walking toward her . She understood then that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why was she lying on the floor ? And why was she sticking out her tongue ? " Why is she sticking out her tongue ? " Mrs. Biddle asked . Even in Claire 's confused state , Mrs. Biddle 's voice was unmistakable : it had the grating edge of a woman who was accustomed to having things her own way . " I was afraid she might swallow it , " the first woman answered . " It can happen when people faint . " I fainted ? Claire opened her eyes . The historical society 's secretary , Adela Crenshaw , was kneeling beside her , gently patting her left hand . The other society members stood behind Adela in a concerned semicircle . " Can it ? " asked Mrs. Biddle , entirely unconvinced . " I learned about it from a CPR course on the internet . " Adela turned back to Claire and saw that she was conscious . " Ah , there she is . " " I fainted ? " Claire asked . Adela smiled radiantly at her . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , you fainted . Passed out cold and toppled like a ton of bricks . Good thing I caught you . And very good thing I spent my youth breaking in wild Arabians "  --  horses , Claire wondered , or people ?  --  " or I would be a frail old lady lying underneath you with a broken hip . Okay , everyone , show 's over . She 's fine . Please help yourselves to iced tea and cookies in the reception area . " The others moved away to the vestibule as Adela and Mrs. Biddle helped Claire to her feet . " This will make a very interesting story for the next newsletter , " Mrs. Biddle said . " Would n't you say , Adela ? " " Very interesting . No one 's ever passed out at the podium before , " Adela explained . Not for the first time did Claire reflect on the drawbacks of living in a town with fewer than a thousand inhabitants . Although she loved its Cape Cod locale and waterside ambience , loved that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General Store ( and that there was a store actually named General Store ) , it was not possible to live an entirely private life in Harriott . Claire was certain that everyone would know she 'd fainted while giving a talk to a small group of geriatrics , long before the historical society newsletter came out . " Even Joshua Deerbottom , " Mrs. Biddle broke in on her thoughts , " who is ninety-three years old , made it through his entire lecture on the Battle of Buzzards Bluff without once falling over . You 're such a young thing , we did expect you to be able to stand for at least twenty minutes or so . You seem to be well enough . " If she were to rate her level of embarrassment from one to ten , Claire figured that she was hovering right around a nine . Mrs. Biddle looked her over carefully . " Are you pregnant ? " And this was ten . " No . " " Well , there must be a reason . " " I think I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestibule when Adela exclaimed brightly , " I almost forgot . We have something to show you . " Claire followed them to the historical society office . " Bitsy , do you know where I put it ? " asked Adela , addressing Mrs. Biddle as Claire marveled that the petite but formidable woman should ever be spoken to so familiarly . " Put what ? " Mrs. Biddle said . " The printout of that article I found on the internet . The one about Venice . " Adela rifled through a few stacks of paper on her desk . " Oh , here it is . " She handed two pages to Claire . " It seemed very much like the subject of your lecture . " VENICE CONFERENCE TO FEATURE NEW STUDIES IN VENETIAN HISTORY , the headline read . The article , from the online edition of the International Herald Tribune , announced that the upcoming five-day conference was being hosted by the Department of History at the University Ca ' Foscari and would be attended by historians from all over Europe . " Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second page of the article . Adela had kindly bracketed the crucial paragraph : " Highlights of the conference include visiting history professor Andrea Kent of Trinity College , Cambridge , whose book in progress , The Spanish Conspiracy of 1618 , will provide the subject matter for two lectures . " " Oh my god , " Claire gasped . She would have sat down in shock except for the fact that there was only one chair in the room , and Adela was already in it . " Maybe you should go and reveal passages from your book , too , " said Adela encouragingly . Even if she could afford a trip to Venice , there was n't a chance she 'd be asked to give a paper there . She was n't a professor ; she did n't even have her doctorate yet . But that was n't her most important concern . What would happen if Andrea Kent 's book was published before her dissertation was completed ? She had believed the Spanish Conspiracy to be so obscure that her dissertation was unique  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd of new Ph.D.s competing for a handful of teaching positions . This book was disturbing news indeed ; its very existence could ruin her life . " Do you have any more information on this conference ? " Claire asked . " I 'm sorry , no , " Adela replied . " I just happened to come across this while I was looking for something else . " " I can guess what you were looking for , " Mrs. Biddle harrumphed . " And what 's wrong with it ? I 've met some very nice gentlemen on the internet . In fact , I have a date for brunch on Sunday . " " That 's five dates in three weeks , " Mrs. Biddle said indignantly . " You 're an eighty-year-old nymphomaniac . " " I am not , " Adela protested . " I 'm seventy-nine . "
