For the winter solstice this year , we thought you deserved a very serious and sober meditation on the meaning of the holidays ... but instead we chose to give you this lighthearted gift . <p> THINK , " SAID VLAD , " THAT there is nothing lonelier than to be a vampire on Christmas Eve . " We all nodded agreement , and not just because he was the Master . " Everything so festive and bright , holy symbols everywhere . Everyone home with their families , full to revulsion with Christmas cheer . " He shuddered . " Yeah , " said Larry . " Even the drunks are in shelters , drinking in the holiday spirit . You just ca n't get a meal anywhere . " " Come on , " I said . I was only a year undead , and hesitant to speak out in such august company , but on this evening they seemed inclined to be kindly toward youth . " It 's not so easy for mortals either . I was a single Jewish woman without family - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores open , no restaurants or movies . Nothing at all to do ... " " Except wander the streets looking for Chinese takeout , and become someone else 's dinner ? " Vlad asked teasingly , and pinched my cheek . He 'd been lonely that night too . " You know what I hate the most about Christmas ? " asked Mr. Bronze . We looked at him respectfully , even the Master . Mr. Bronze was , after all , older than all of us together . He could complain authoritatively about the loneliness of a stranger in Athens during the Eleusyian Mysteries , in ancient Baghdad during Ramadan , in Rome at Saturnalia , in China at New Year , in the Cave of the Old Ones at the Feast of the Great Bear .... He had been an outsider throughout recorded human history and long before . We waited expectantly . " What I hate most , " said Mr. Bronze , " is those darn reruns of It 's a Wonderful Life , " Vlad passed around chilled AB negative - you just ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry to start the videos . " Oh no ! 11 Larry cried , and cringed . He remembered the old days , when the Master was given to fits of temper . Before the Twentieth Century , with its psychoanalysis , behaviorism , and rebirthing therapy . But mostly , before the Master took to hunting in neighborhoods where most of the blood was enriched with Prozac , with just a soupron of Xanax . " What 's wrong ? " we asked . We hoped he had n't brought vampire movies , a prank which had previously cost him two months locked in his coffin without dinner . The Master hated vampire movies - not only for the sheer defamation of character , but because he thought he should be getting residuals . ( Though we did all have a sneaking fondness for Love at First Bite . ) " My videos ! Look ! " Larry hit the on button , and a black and white movie began . Miracle on 34th Street ! " That was supposed to be Fellini 's Satyricon , " Larry wailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this was supposed to be PeeWee 's Big Adventure , and this was - ouch ! " He dropped the cassette , fingers sizzling . " Not The Greatest Story Ever Told ? " Lila asked sympathetically . Larry sprinted to the kitchen to run cold water over his hand . The Master sighed , and leaned back in his chair . We could hear carols drifting up from the apartment below . " Well , on the bright side , " he remarked , " some other loving family has our movies . " So we did what all vampires eventually wind up doing on Christmas Eve , unless they plan ahead . We set out for Blockbuster Video . The streets of Christmas Eve were as I remembered them from life : deserted . Store windows still shone brightly , luring you to the impending retail bacchanalia . Luckily there were not many frankly religious displays to make us ill , but the nondenominational splendor of trees and Santas was still enough to inspire queasiness , or at least angst . A cheery mortal couple rushed by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . " No , young one , " whispered Vlad , a restraining hand upon my arm . " You would n't like the taste . " I 'd been told . Next to sheer religious fervor , nothing quite spoils the bouquet as much as hope , merriment , and visions of sugar plums . We paused before a toy store window . A lifesize animated Santa waved from a sleigh overflowing with gifts . " Hmmph , " said Mr. Bronze . " Does n't look a bit like him . " Then we heard the sound of childish voices raised in song . jingle Bells , luckily . After a month of a steady onslaught of Silent Night , I was ready to go berserk if I heard it again . The building opposite was well lit and busy , and nauseating odors of turkey , ham , and holiday cheer wafted out every time the door opened . " They 've turned it into a shelter for homeless families , " said Mr. Bronze . He liked to keep up with the news . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children . Not just donated or repaired toys , either ... They 're all going to get the hottest items . " We nodded . The media-blitz toys , not so special except in their lurid scarceness . Bermuda Barbie , dressed for Christmas at Club Med . Auctioned for $2000 each in the want ads . And GI Santa ... Last week , two fathers had beaten each other into intensive care for the last one on the shelves at FAO Schwartz . The little homeless children were to be the recipients of a fortune in trendy toys . And afterward , the shelter workers would offer the homeless parents $20 and steal home with the treasure . But it was the thought that counted . The off-tune chirpy voices began mangling Good King Wenceslas . " Oh , can we peek at them ? " Lila pleaded . " Please , Master , they sound adorable . " Vlad smiled , and shrugged . " Sure . " We hurried across the street eagerly . Vampires are like that , sentimental . Human children strike us as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4H future farmers and their lambs and calves . We stared in the window , making ourselves insubstantial so no one would try to drag us inside to feed or bless us . That happened once to Vlad 's vampiric son Arnie , and the Master still told the story as a cautionary tale to baby vampires . It would have been a heartwarming sight were we not , of course , coldblooded . There were the unkempt starving parents and children , staring hopefully at the food , and the tree , and the Santas . " Hey , " hissed Rhonda . She did n't talk much , but she was an excellent huntress , trained before death by seeking bargains at Bloomies . " Do you smell it ? " We did . Fresh blood , on the hoof . Avaricious , evil blood , devoid of holiday cheer . Rhonda beckoned , and we followed , Mr. Bronze and the Master taking the rear with the caution of centuries . We trailed along the side of the building and found a door propped open . Inside was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men stuffing them into sacks . Bizarro Santa Clauses , taking presents from the good little children . We looked at the Master and he smiled indulgently . " Go ahead , my children . " So we fell upon the thieves , grabbing them before they could make a sound . We abandoned the bags of loot to be found by the shelter Santas , who would conclude that the thieves had been overcome , not by superhumanly strong vampires , but by Christmas spirit . And we took the thieves home and had a wonderful feast , drinking way too much until there was nothing left except empty husks to be stuffed into trash bags and dumped later . Afterward we sat gorged before a blazing fire and reminisced about previous feasts . Then Vlad looked at me and said , " It 's almost sunrise , time for all young vampires to go to bed . " And I curled up snugly and thought that nothing was quite so pleasant as a holiday meal with your family , when I heard a sudden clatter on the roof and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lid of my coffin , before I realized that it was only Larry and Mr. Bronze , flying the trash to Jersey . " I
