This is the strange but true story of how a failed jazz pianist from Passaic , N.J. , became the author of one of the best-selling books in history . In 1997 Mitch Albom wrote a sad , funny account of his conversations with a dying man . Tuesdays with Morrie went on to sell more than 5.7 million copies in hardcover alone . It spent four straight years at the top of the New York Times best-seller list . Now the story is getting stranger : Albom has done it again , with a novel called The Five People You Meet in Heaven ( Hyperion ; 196 pages ) . <P> At least 5.7 million people  --  plus everybody who saw the TV movie or the off-Broadway play  --  already know the story of Morrie Schwartz , Albom 's Brandeis professor who died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . Albom , who gave up jazz to become a sportswriter , still seems a little shell-shocked by Morrie 's success . Six years of having complete strangers come up to you and bare their souls will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albom says , " if I walked through an airport and somebody recognized me , they 'd always say , ' Who 's going to win the World Series ? Who 's going to win the Super Bowl ? ' And I would just keep walking  --  I would answer , but I would always keep walking . After Tuesdays with Morrie , people would recognize me , but they would say , ' I have to tell you something : my son just died of ALS . ' Well , you ca n't keep walking anymore . " <P> In person Albom is a small , intense guy with a large , handsome head ; he bears a strong resemblance to a bobble-head doll . He has become the king of a certain highly potent brand of uplifting , inspirational wisdom  --  in the words of his friend the novelist Amy Tan , he is " the rabbi of everybody . " Maybe it 's an easy , sentimental kind of wisdom , but it is a kind for which there is an obvious , urgent , demonstrable need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He used the profits from Morrie to pay his professor 's medical bills , and to this day he voluntarily splits the income from the book fifty-fifty with Morrie 's family . <P> The hero of The Five People You Meet in Heaven is an 83-year-old amusement-park repairman named Eddie . Eddie is gruff and lonely and feels as if his life has been a waste . By the end of Chapter 1 Eddie is dead , having been killed trying to save a little girl from a runaway ride . We follow him into heaven . He does n't meet Morrie there . Instead , he meets a guy with blue skin . <P> The blue guy worked at the amusement park too , in a freak show , and as a young boy Eddie inadvertently caused an auto accident that killed him . " There are five people you meet in heaven , " the Blue Man explains . " Each of us was in your life for a reason . You may not have known the reason at the time , and that is what heaven is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme , and Albom 's , is the interconnectedness of all our lives , and the impossibility of knowing the consequences of our actions in the grand scheme of things . <P> Five People is a harsher and maybe more honest book than Morrie . Morrie was about understanding life . Five People is about accepting the fact that true understanding is not the lot of the living . " Everybody walks around with a bunch of questions that are n't answered , " Albom says , sounding genuinely upset about it . " And they never get the answers . They just go right through to the end of their life and never get ' em . "
