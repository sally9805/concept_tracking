At some point along the way , almost every child fantasizes about what life would be like without parents . It would be oodles of fun , with unlimited television , ice cream every night for dinner and none of those pesky rules imposed by the adult world . And , of course , there would be no homeowner 's insurance , car payments or utility bills either . Except that 's not the way it works . <P> Dave Eggers , in his best-selling A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius ( Vintage , 2001 ) recounts with candor and humor how he raised Toph , a brother 13 years his junior , following the death of their parents within 32 days of each other . " I have to get a resume together , " Eggers wrote , " and we have to find a new place to live when the sublet ends , and how will Toph get to school if I get an early job ... Should I lighten my hair ? Does that whitening toothpaste really work ? Toph needs health insurance . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today about 2 million Tophs  --  children currently in kinship care  --  according to a recent study by the Urban Institute titled " Children Cared for by Relatives : Who Are They and How Are They Faring ? " The number has been rising significantly over the past 20 years , and in 1996 the U.S. Census Bureau began tracking domestic situations that differ from the traditional two-parent household . Siblings raising siblings account for approximately 140,000 of those cases . Sondra Jackson , the Interim Receiver of the Child and Family Services Agency in Washington , explains , " In the 1980s , we lost about 50,000 foster-care homes nationwide . So we began to look at relatives as potential caretakers . " The idealized version of a sibling-run household was promoted by the 1990s television drama Party of Five , which chronicled the Salinger family after their parents died in a car accident . But real-life siblings who have weathered tragic loss and then learned to improvise their way through parent-teacher conferences and dentist appointments will tell you it is not the romanticized stuff of television . <P> Janice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate student on the verge of starting an internship when her parents ' bitter divorce resulted in her taking sole guardianship of her sister Lisa , 11 . Unprepared , Janice had to reorganize her life quickly . She pursued a job rather than an internship and moved into Stanford University family housing with her boyfriend Scott , who was willing to share parenting responsibilities . Dr. Laurie Kramer , a University of Illinois siblings expert , says that for the older sibling , such an upheaval can be restricting . " The ages from 18 to 25 are really a time of life when you 're exploring , " says Kramer . " If the older siblings are taking care of the younger ones , they 've lost that opportunity to be free . " But , Janice insists , " I did n't want my sister in foster care . I was grateful that I was old enough to take care of her . " <P> Today Lisa , 19 , a college sophomore , talks frequently with her sister and returns to Janice 's home during vacations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and daughter than sisters . " Because we 're so far apart in age , we do n't have the kind of sister relationship most people have , " says Lisa . " She 'll probably always be a caretaker figure . I 'm just starting to get into the friend thing . "
