I found out later it was just about the time I spanked an eight-iron to the edge of the number twelve green at the Bob Hope Classic that someone plunged an ordinary table knife into her heart . Six times . That was after whoever the killer was beat her bloody with a Krups cappuccino machine . Her naked body was discovered lying in her own gore in the kitchen of her moderately expensive Santa Monica beachfront apartment , and the medical examiner later determined she 'd had rough sex , or been forcibly raped , shortly before she was killed . <p> <p> It takes a very angry or very psychotic human being to kill another of his species up close with a knife . Try shoving your ginsu into an uncooked chicken if you do n't believe me . Gristle and bone are tough and unyielding . So how much angrier , or psychotic , does a person have to be to do that with a dinner knife ? A round-nosed , unsharpened , serrated-edged , stainless-steel dinner knife . <p> <p> Six times . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She was a pretty girl , an erstwhile actress and part-time waitress , who was better at rising through the social strata of the movie industry on the arms of various important men than she was at learning her craft and landing roles . Girls like her are cannon fodder for that business , like Russian peasants at the siege of Leningrad getting crushed by German Panzers . And yet somehow , year after year , more and more keep running to the front . Thousands of eager little beavers , maybe hundreds of thousands for all I know , 99.999 percent of whom never make a dime as actresses . I guess they keep coming because every once in a while , a Gwyneth or Julia or Halle manages to rise above the clamoring fray and live a fairy-tale life of money , magazine covers , gossip columns , mansions , and equally famous **26;244;TOOLONG . <p> <p> Come to think of it , in terms of the odds against making it big and being a house hold name , it 's not that much different from my line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an appealing little laugh , a nice little story of making her way from Bumpkin , Illinois , or someplace , all the way to Hollywood , and an earnest little head full of dreams . <p> <p> Dreams . <p> <p> The crack cocaine of the unaccomplished . <p> <p> She was a pretty girl who , like dozens of others that same day around this sometimes violent nation of ours , was in a position to be murdered primarily because she was a pretty girl . Occupational hazard . <p> <p> And while I was trying to close a two-stroke deficit to make the cut on a Friday afternoon on a typical Southern California winter day so crisp and clear it actually hurt your eyes to look up and watch the fight of the ball against the blue , someone who was very , very angry with this particular pretty girl plunged an ordinary dinner knife into her pretty chest . Six times . <p> <p> Her name was Holly Ann Cramer . <p> <p> I did n't know her well , although I ran into her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Holly would 've been a remarkable beauty anywhere on earth except Hollywood . She was , there , just another exquisite tulip in the vast fields of Holland . Sandy blond hair . Slim hips , full lips , perky tips . Brown eyes still unguarded and friendly , which was more a reflection of her limited time in LaLaLand than any realization of her limited chances of success . I recall her being nice to stand near . She smelled like summer . <p> <p> Had she not been dating a guy I knew , I might 've even made an effort to connect . But Los Angeles is Holland and the tulips are aplenty , and I 've never been one to try to horn in on another guy 's squeeze . Not that I even could 've in this case . The guy she was dating happened to be the current Savior of the City , a multimillionaire stud-puppy athlete who was supposed to bring the hapless L.A. Dodgers back to their formerly formidable winning ways . <p> <p> I first met Joniel Baker at a pro-am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the am . Although that day it would 've been hard to know the difference . Joniel is one of these natural athletes you really just have to hate . He 's gifted at all sports , period . Took up golf three years ago and already has a gorgeous , effortless , loopy swing similar to the one he used to get on base two hundred times last season . There are guys on the tour who would kill for a swing like that . He 's a long-ball hitter with good extension and only a little wild off the tee at times . Easy , consistent iron play . If not for his heavy hands around the greens he would be a scratch player . <p> <p> As it was , we won the tourney handily , grinned while we took a half-million-dollar check from the tournament sponsor , and handed it over to the nice lady from the Red Cross , and pocketed five grand each from a side bet with Phil Mickelson and his clarinet-playing amateur partner . Which really , really bugged Lefty . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged Joniel to a double-or-nothing free-throw shootout on his home all-weather composite-surfaced basketball court he was so damn proud of , and Joniel sank fifty-two in a row to take another five k from our host . Phil plays everything like he plays golf : with full-out balls-to-the-wall confidence . As a result , up until the last few years he famously lost tournaments he should 've won , but he always looked like he had a lot of fun doing it . Still , who in their right mind would go up against a former collegiate two-sporter in a game of horse ? If Joniel had a few more inches coming out of UNLV , University of Nevada , Las Vegas , he would 've been drafted by the NBA , too . But God love him , Lefty thinks he can beat anybody if he just tries hard enough , so he talks trash with Joniel and convinces him to have a shoot-out . What a wonderful lunatic . Ten grand is nothing to the Masters champ these days , but his pretty wife , Amy , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oasis called La Quinta , about a hundred and fifty miles away from where Holly lay sprawled on the Saltillo tile with a knife protruding from her chest and every last wisp of dignity and light and promise and dreams vanishing to wherever such things go , I chipped in from a foot off the green for a birdie three . Six more holes to make one more birdie and live to play another day and maybe even finish in the real money , although that was something I refuse to let enter my mind during a match . Nothing dims your focus like thoughts of winning . You tighten up , start to overthink every shot , and the putts . . . God , the putts . . . like some force field surrounds the cup . I do n't know how the other guys do it , but when I feel those **47;272;TOOLONG ? thoughts start to well up from my gut , I pull out the big guns . The really big guns . <p> <p> Pamela Anderson 's breasts . <p> <p> I picture those impossibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart rate lowers , my hands steady , and my mind empties of extraneous crap like wondering if I 'm going to win , and how much money would that be after taxes and my caddie Kenny 's cut , and who 'll interview me on the Golf Channel . Works every time . <p> <p> Try it . I bet you just glazed over for a second and thought about her enormous breasts , even if you 're a woman . Know why ? Because we 've all seen them . It 's a fact . Every single person in the Western world has at some time or another seen Pamela Anderson 's tits . And maybe because they 're so familiar to me , pictorially speaking , of course , they act as a sort of hypnotic talisman , or sacred religious relic , or . . . juvenile erotic distraction . Probably the last . <p> <p> The thirteenth hole was a downhill par-three with a tricky little swale just behind the cup that , if you hit the slightest bit long , would take your ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bunker . I know : That 's what happened to me here the day before . I had asked Kenny for my eight-iron ; he squinted the way he does when he 's not sure that 's the right club , but he could n't argue with the distance . I smacked an easy , smooth , pretty little shot that landed four feet short of the flag , bounced past it , and ended up a good twenty yards away in a steep-sided sand trap . I walked away with a miserable double bogey . <p> <p> I 'm not by any means the biggest guy on tour , just a hair over six feet , but like most of the younger generation of players , I work hard at conditioning . That pays off in distance , with every club in the bag . Most of the time that 's a good thing . Sometimes , I have to remind myself to dial it back a bit . So this time , lesson learned , I reached for the nine , aimed a little left of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the club face cut through the ball . It started left then floated in a wide curve and plopped on the fringe in front of the green , slowly rolling to a stop seven feet from the cup . I smelled my birdie . <p> <p> Oh , if it were only so easy . <p> <p> I two-putted , of course . Then got a bogey on number fourteen , birdied the fifteenth to put me back just below the expected cut line , and made a tidy pair of recovery shots from the trees and a greenside bunker on the sixteenth to save par . <p> <p> The seventeenth was a dogleg left par-five , 581 yards , with a water hazard in play to the right . It set up well for my swing , and knowing that , I tried to uncork a long drive . <p> <p> Within a split second of contact , the crucial data imparted by ball meeting club face had traveled up the shaft to my fingertips and from there to my suddenly not-so-happy brain . I watched as the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buried itself among the top reaches of the lovely palm trees massed along the friendly green shores of the fairway . Golf is such a forgiving game . <p> <p> A communal gasp rose from the modest gallery that surrounded the tee box , and I 'm pretty sure I heard John Daly , who was playing in my group , snicker . Like he 's never sent one on a tour of the real estate . In the history of professional golf there has never been a guy who 's blown more chances , on the course and off . I resisted the urge to shoot him a glance and tried instead to affect a nonchalant raise of the eyebrows . That was really hard to do at that particular moment . Instead , I probably looked like I was about to strangle a Taiwanese orphan . <p> <p> Kenny took the driver from my hands . <p> <p> Take a breath , Huckleberry . You 're fine . <p> <p> Okay , yes , that 's really my name . So my dad was obviously a big Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He deliberately did n't give me a middle name so I had few options growing up except to run or fight . Huckleberry Doyle . A schoolyard bully 's wet dream of a name . Kenny and my dad always use the full thing . Pretty much everyone else just calls me Huck . If you have n't heard of me , well , it 's probably because I 'm one of many professional golfers who makes an adequate living playing the game we love , but who has yet to win a major tournament . I came out of college as the next big thing , U.S. Amateur Champion , ready to take the golf world by storm . Did n't quite happen that way . I had a few good showings at minor tournaments early in my career and even a posted top-ten finish at the PGA Championship two years ago , but in reality I 'm what they call a scuffler . I 'm usually found in the bottom half of the pack , picking up some show-up money and freebies , driving around in the courtesy cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but secretly making barely enough to keep my tour card . It 's the small tournaments that put money in the bank for us . Like a pool-hall hustler trying for a title , for some reason we have a better chance to clean up as long as the big stakes are n't on the table . <p> <p> I have no idea why Kenny stays with me . His income is tied to mine . <p> <p> I managed a slight smile . <p> <p> That thing looked like it had someplace else it wanted to go . He flashed the barest of winks as he brushed by me , which , in the spare , nothing-wasted lexicon of Kennyspeak , meant , Do n't sweat it : It 's not as bad as it looks . <p> <p> After five years of this weird partnership that is golfer and caddie , I have learned to trust this man implicitly , most of the time without question . Most of the time , he 's right . But when we 've disagreed and I 've gone with my club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises to about 100 percent . The tactical mistakes I 've made in tournaments came from disregarding his advice . Oh , I hit crappy shots , and miss putts , and shank and scull and chili-dip as much as most other pros , but those things are part of the operational aspects of this battle against psyche and physics we call golf . Ken Czwikowski ca n't hit a golf ball straight to save his life , but he is a master tactician when it comes to reading distances , the roll of a green , the lift of the wind . He 's like the guy from that movie The Matrix , Neo , who sees the glowing green binary code streaming down , the underlying structure of the world , how things really are , not just how they seem . <p> <p> If I could bring myself to listen to him all the time , hey , I 'd be a pretty damn good golfer . <p> <p> But I 'd be lacking a Y chromosome . <p> <p> This time . . . he was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see my little white Titleist Pro-V1 with the red dot on it lying in the second cut just off the fairway . Somehow the ball had sailed through the gauntlet of palm fronds and tree trunks , inexplicably missing them all , and took a shortcut to the Promised Land . By eliminating a big swath of middle fairway this was the equivalent of a 370-yard drive . I was 211 yards from that big , open , . at green that made this hole the most birdied on the course , and with a solid second shot , I could be looking at putting for eagle . <p> <p> Pamela Anderson . Pamela Anderson . Pamela Anderson . <p> <p> We had to wait for Daly and the others who had n't driven as far to hit their second shots , which I 'll admit gave me no small amount of pleasure . Then Kenny sidles up , tosses a few strands of grass in the air , and watches them . oat away . <p> <p> Steady five knots maybe , helping wind . <p> <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his ac-cumulated knowledge of the golf course . In the week prior to the tournament he walked every inch of La Quinta , measuring distances from fairway bunkers or distinctive trees , marking down how the greens are contoured . Like a lot of veteran caddies , Kenny likes to have all his thoughts and notes and memories from past rounds at hand , so instead of starting a fresh book each year , he keeps adding on to the original one . Damn thing must weigh five pounds with all the new pages over the years . <p> <p> Deuce and a quarter to the pin , give or take . Not much roll from the sides . Slight movement maybe toward the back of the green , but not a lot . Pretty flat . <p> <p> Translation : We were looking at a fairly attractive landing zone . <p> <p> Drop it in front and let it run a bit ? <p> <p> Kenny nodded and put his hand on the seven-iron . I had been thinking about hitting a six and started to reach for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually had enough sense to pay attention . Two-hundred-plus yards is a long way to hit a seven-iron , but with a solid strike , the wind coming from behind us , and a good roll , I can make the distance . <p> <p> Then it struck me , Kenny was also thinking eagle . <p> <p> Damn . Kenny almost never thinks eagle . He 's the guy in the stirrups who 's usually telling me , Whoa there , big fella . . . get the safe birdie . <p> <p> My gut tightened up . My heart missed a beat . I had to step away from the ball , pretend I was scanning the treetops for signs of nefarious winds , and take yet another little mental walk with the silicone twins . I ca n't remember the last time I had to do that twice in one tournament , much less twice on one hole . <p> <p> How 're the girls ? <p> <p> Kenny was smiling at me . He knows all my tricks . <p> <p> Getting sunburned from all the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm not thinking nothing but watching you swing a club and hit a ball like you 've done a hundred million times before . <p> <p> The golf course was absolutely silent . A few spectators had wandered up close and were standing quietly , waiting for my shot . I reached down and plucked a few more strands of grass and tossed them in the air . They lollygagged past me exactly the same way Kenny 's had . I took the seven from his outstretched hand and tried to be glib . <p> <p> How about steak to night ? Feel like a good porter house or something ? <p> <p> Sounds good , Huckleberry . <p> <p> He heaved the big bag onto his shoulder and moved away . I stood behind the ball , pictured my easy swing and the flight path of the ball arching toward the green . I imagined a little door about six feet in front of me that would be the target zone I 'd hit through . In my mind 's eye I saw the ball roll up onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> Then I stepped up and tried to replicate everything I 'd just seen . <p> <p> It happened almost exactly as I imagined it would . We got our eagle . <p> <p> It was one of those precious few thrilling moments in the life of a tour player that makes one think it 's actually possible to be really good at this game . I was flying . Full of confidence . Bring on the world . I had this tournament in the bag . <p> <p> Until the next hole . <p> <p> I was so damn . red up I plopped my drive on the eighteenth smack into the middle of the pond . Chipped over the green . Two-putted for a double bogey . <p> <p> We finished one over the cut line , which meant Kenny and I were going home early this weekend . <p> <p> Such is golf . <p> <p> Excerpted from A TIGHT LIE by DON DAHLER Copyright 2009 by Don Dahler Published in March 2009 by St. Martin 's           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
