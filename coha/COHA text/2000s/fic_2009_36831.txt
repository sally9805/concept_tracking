" Abbie 's Babies " : After the birth of her child and the simultaneous desertion or abduction of her husband  --  last seen gazing skyward from a local hilltop  --  Abbie gets to wondering . She wonders why her children are so puny , when her pregnancies all lasted upward of ten months . She wonders why none of the kids look like her , why they all bear such a striking resemblance to her short , slight , pop-eyed , pointy-eared , bigheaded husband . She wonders why she was so irresistibly attracted to the man , whose personality  --  cold , aloof , superior  --  was as unappealing as his physical appearance . She wonders why her seven children have inherited those traits , along with their father 's high , toneless , " unearthly " voice and cold , clammy " reptilian " flesh . Can it be ( as her gynecologist suggests ) that Abbie 's chromosomes are " just too wimpy to assert themselves " ? No . It turns out her husband was actually a Martian , one of hundreds impersonating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Martians , we are told , reproduce asexually but viviparously , the male of the species depositing an egg inside the female , whose job is just to incubate it . ) <p> Things are not what they seem : If I had to reduce Dank 's metaphysics to a simple formula , that would be it . And , I 'd add , not everything that looks like a human actually is , since that was the deception Dank found most disturbing . " It 's bad enough when some dumb bug impersonates a twig , " as the narrator of another story says , " but when you find out that your roommate is really a Venusian , then you do n't know who to trust . " Dank 's fiction swarms with seeming humans who prove really to be androids , simulacra , clones , hallucinations , holograms , extraterrestrials , or worse . Usually extraterrestrials . Dank , I think , sometimes suspected that everyone but he was only posing as an earthling . <p> " Abruptophobia " : Jim is an audio repairman in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head with a rolling pin , he develops a morbid sensitivity to everything sudden : a camera 's flash , a thunderclap , even a violent sneeze ( and even when he is the sneezer ) . Jim also has a bad heart , so his new allergy to surprises endangers his life , and reduces him to a bedridden invalid in a soundproof room ( a room that also functions as a refuge from his marriage ) . He is thrilled the day his doctor tells him of a wonder drug named Graduall . Originally developed for the drivers of the superfast and frequently colliding helibuses that are now the standard form of mass transportation , Graduall makes everything appear to happen in slow motion . Jim gets a prescription , and his abruptophobia clears up at once , since when you 're on Graduall , nothing is abrupt . Not even the explosion of a toy balloon : <p> <p> One time Julia Jim 's awful wife tried to surprise him , or maybe , mused Jim with a cold chill , to kill me by inducing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't looking with a red balloon and sticking a big pin in it , so it would pop . Except , on account of Jim 's altered perception of Time , due to the drug that he was on , it took so long for the balloon to pop , seemingly , that it sounded more like when you open a creaky door , slowly . Gruffly , Jim wheeled around and saw Julia wincing from the loudness of the noise even though it paradoxically did n't bother him one bit , ironically . He derisively laughed at her so-called " prank . " <p> <p> So far so good . The following day Jim is feeling so perky that he tiptoes up behind his spouse , as she stands " making noises " at the kitchen sink ( Dank was still unclear at that point as to just what women do there ) , and startles her for a change by pinching her rump , as he has n't dared to do since their honeymoon . Julia jumps , but Jim gets the bigger surprise : thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost instantaneous , from her real self into the ugly and shrewish but seemingly human woman he married . Her real self turns out to be " some kind of hideous Thing , the color of a rotten avocado , with fangs instead teeth and eyeballs dangling from long slimy stalks . " Jim clutches his heart and drops to the linoleum , and " Julia , " with no further need for concealment , reverts to her fanged and avocado-colored self the better to gloat at his death agonies . <p> " Abruptophobia " was written in 1976 , during Dank 's first marriage ( to the ill-tempered Jessica Teller ) . In the spring of ' 76 , when his Amphetamine habit first got out of hand , Dank himself developed an abnormal and unhealthy sensitivity to the abrupt  --  to everything that rudely claimed his attention or rerouted his train of thought . All at once he was so sensitive to noises , even his own , that he glued a circle of felt to the bottom of his favorite coffee mug ( science fiction writers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from startling him each time he set it down . He also modified his toaster to eject his toast in slow motion rather than a spasm of mechanical panic . He had to give up his favorite pastry , those " poppin ' fresh " biscuits packaged in a special cardboard cylinder designed to burst open at the seams , with a never-quite-anticipated POP ! , as you peel off the helically wrapped label . No , it was all too much for him  --  the POP ! , the leap of the can , the instantaneous expansion of dough into daylight like an angry mollusk surging from its shell , at once thoroughly expected and utterly surprising . <p> After a few weeks , Dank reduced his daily ration of amphetamines and his abruptophobia vanished , but not before he had a chance to take down all the mirrors in his house in order to avoid the jolt of sudden confrontations with his image . He even squandered a day in the basement trying to invent a new kind of mirror in which it would take a minute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though he never managed to patent his " gradual mirror , " a **42;878;TOOLONG combination , Dank convinced himself that his invention was destined one day to replace the old-fashioned unelectrified variety . <p> <br> Continues ...
