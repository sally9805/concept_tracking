MAXIMUM INDOOR TRAINING I beg to differ with your 8 Tips for Maximum indoor Benefit ( " Summer Fitness ! Right Now , " March ) . There 's classical music out there that really does rock-and that you can only play loud . Reference : Wagner 's " Ride of the Valkyries " and Shostakovich 's Fifth Symphony . And it does n't necessarily make one sensitive . Just ask my husband . Melissa Gross Frederick , MID I did n't believe two of your tips until I found out for myself : - Ride to Aggressive Tunes , and - Turn Off the Tube I got a trainer for Christmas , and when we got snowed in during late January , I began to use it a lot . I 'd schedule my rides for a good hour block of TV programming . One day , however , there was nothing on . I went to the cellar , dusted off some old records and put them on an old turntable I have down there , Riding to Iron Maiden gave me a much better workout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in the first place . Ray Anair Royalston , MA PREVENT SPEEDO SUP-OUTS I enjoyed your March Maintenance article on speedometer problems ( " Why Did My Cycling Computer Quit ? " ) ; however , nothing was said about preventing speedometer head terminal connection oxidation . I was an automotive technician for General Motors and we used a dielectric grease on electrical connections . Dielectric grease is a clear , clean and conductive lubricate that has a high boiling point . It 's used to keep moisture and air out of electronic connections-and it 'll prevent the wear that results from the continual removal of a speedo head ( such as when you clean your bike ) . It also keeps water off the terminals , making sure your reading does n't blink during rainy rides . You can purchase some at any auto parts store . Ted Lenzie Folsom , CA ANTI-FLAT ADVICE G'day ! My usual night ride of 60 km around the beautiful Bellarine Peninsula is a wonderful stress release for myself and regular riding partners . I just thought I 'd share one conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all readers-not just Aussies . Peter , who works in our local bike shop , shared the most common complaint heard in the shop : " The tube you sold me already had a hole in it ! " Manufacturers do n't sell tubes with pre-packaged holes ! People buy tubes , go home , insert the tube without checking the tire for still-embedded glass or thorns-or to see if the rim tape is damaged-and puncture the new tube . Or they use old spoons or sharp objects as tire levers and pinch the tube . // ONE-LEG WORKOUTS // Troy Lethlean Ocean Grove , Victoria , Australia PS . Great mag-a good change of pace , especially with so many mags on the market . P.P.S. Just bought a Cannondale R3000-you Yanks make the best aluminum bikes in the world ! WHO COULD ARGUE ? Bicycling is like religion for many of us . But it 's more of a Martin Luther thing , not Tammy Faye . Happy trails .

David McMillan East Hartland , CT AGAIN-WHO COULD DISAGREE ? In love , I have a Cannondale that I 've had for almost two years ( replacing my alum Panasonic ) . Just looking it makes my heart rate pick up in anticipation of ride . But like a dog , if I 'm not actually going for ride , I become spastic , and bark ; why not ? Andrew Winch Perrysburg , OH BIKE COLOR MATTERS In " Seven Reasons People Buy the Wrong Bike " ( Buying , October ) you included " color lust : ' Shades of Henry Ford 's Model T !

Mark LeBlanc Lafayette , LA DAVE STOHLER STARTED THIS WAY I 'm 16 and have been biking for more than 6 years . I plan on going crosscountry when I get out of high school . I also plan on racing in the Tour De France . It 's a big dream but I have a feeling it will come true . My friends say I 'm a little crazy . My room is covered with pictures of Bianchis and Treks . Everything has to do with biking . I 'm what some would call a little obsessed . I love biking more than anything . Keep up the great work .

It 's refreshing to see the Metal Cowboy each month capture the quirky nuances of traveling by bike-the human interaction , the invigorating exposure to the natural world , the joyof traveling by bike . Paul Kemp Ride Director , Pathfinders Bicycle Tours Oakridge , OR A GRATUITOUS 10-SPEED RANT When will the insanity end ? Somebody please tell me that someone else somewhere was happy with his 7-speed and only bought 8 when 7-speed shifters wore out and none could be found , and are now playing hunt-and-find on the Internet to collect " old " 8-speed stuff to keep his prized machine running .

Are we all turning into mindless commercially swayed zombies who buy anything that comes out ? Have some sense , people ! Your stuff does n't quit working because something new came out . Mike Taylor via e-mail ANTI-SKIn OUTCRY During more than 20 years of bike racing experience and more than 10 years of working in the bike industry , I 've never written to a magazine . But " How to do Perfect Skid-Slides , " ( Skills , March ) compells me to . have the utmost respect for former world champion Greg Herbold 's skills , and agree that the technique is good for racing and emergency situations . But skidding should not be done on local trails . It causes erosion . And antimountain bike groups use skid marks as ammunition to close trails to bikes . Nowhere do you warn readers that skids are bad for trails ( and-the sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trail Hands ) Norristown , PA Here 's a concept : Learn to ride responsibly . It used to be that someone who could n't negotiate a turn without skidding was looked down on as being an unskilled , irresponsible rider . Ride it , do n't slide it , BICYCLING . Larry Sage Truckee , CA Teaching skidding techniques is like teaching how togettrails closed . Patrick King Newark DE Maybe Herbold won championships by skid-sliding down hills , but that was a decade ago and we all know now that skidding is NOT cool . Being in control without abusing the trail is . Please read your articles before you print them . This one needed a big disclaimer : Skidding is bad for singletrack-only do this on gravel or sandy roads . Marcel Slootheer Oklahoma City You 're right , guys : Skids are stupid on trails . And we did n't put that in our article . We enjoy imagining that our readers-you guys-do n't require remedial tutoring or sermons . Every time we do a road skills piece , we do n't spell out that bitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're giving you , let us know . And , bey , Marcel-thanks for that tip about reading our articles before we print them . We gave ita try this month and although it really slowed things down , it helped . Sidebar DEXTER BEN-JAM-IN Thank you , thank you , thank you for the wonderful story of one-legged New York City bicycle courier Dexter Benjamin ( " The Messenger , " March ) . Even if he never competes in the Para-Olympics , - he will always be a winner . Keith A. Olson St Paul , IVIN Like many people with whom I shared the article , I was drawn in not only by Dexter 's struggle to make a living and stay alive in Manhattan traffic , but by his quest to compete in the Para-Olympics . It seems criminal-in this climate of huge corporate profits and billions dumped on Superbowl ads so that the big-dollar sissies can earn their endorsements-that no funds could be found to support this athlete in his dream . I 'll put up the first 20 bucks to send this guy to nationals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign up to contribute . Oshawa , Ontario With the U.S. trials in April John , and Dexter still uncommited the last time we talked with him , there 's not much we can do . But check BICYCLING.com for an update in April . As soon as I finished reading the last sentence of Dexter 's story I put on my bike shorts and shoes and went out for a ride . I wanted to experience exactly what one-legged cycling felt like . I was blown away by the effort . I 've done four-hour centuries , double centuries and a brief stint as a Cat 3 road racer , but I was wasted within half a mile . My leg literally seized up . Later , I started thinking : If my solo leg is so weak , would n't there be a significant training advantage to working out just one leg at a time ? I mean absolutely no disrespect to Dexter , and I know that given the context I might seem tacky ( at best ) or morbid ( at worst ) for askingbut can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franciso you got guts , Paul . But we 're glad you asked . And-knowing Dexter 's love of speed-we 're sure he 's happy to see anyone get faster via his inspirationOne-leg workouts will make you faster They blast your strength , smooth out your spin , increase your leg speed and boost your anaerobic power . When you pedal with two legs , one leg compensates for dead spots in the other leg 's stroke , making each limb seem more fluid and Powerful than it is . When you use a single leg , you 're training your bip flexors and bamstrings to apply power through the entire stroke . Turn to page 20 for a 4-week training program that isolates each leg . Do n't worry ifyou ca n't finish the workouts at first-they 're murder . Sidebar SANITARY READER OF THE MONTH Using Fast Orange and similar products to get the grease off your hands is pretty good advice ( " How Do I Get My Hands Clean , " Maintenance , March ) , but Shidan Towfiq skips too lightly over the problem of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your social life a little bit-unless you 're dating someone who 's into that sort of thing . A little trick to beat the black crud : Get an old bar of soap , the kind that 's always soggy from sitting in a puddle next to the sink . Before you pick up a spanner or a chain tool , dig your fingertips into the mushy side of the soap so that plenty of the white stuff coats the undersides of the nails . Then get to work . When you go to scrub up at the end of the working day , you 'll find your nails come as clean as those of any dot-com paper millionaire . You may not look quite so hardcore , but clean hands are infinitely sexier . Mark O'Leary Newton , MA Sidebar STYLE INTERVENTIONS After I read my March issue of BICYCLING , I looked at the back cover . The photo in the ad caused me to smile with great pride : Lance Armstrong , riding the cobblestones of Paris , looking glorious atop his beautiful bike , carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I noticed next caused me to faint in horror . He 's wearing running shoes ! ( Cue the Psycho shower-scene music here . ) My wife later told me the last thing she heard me say before I hit the ground was , " Style Man , save us ... " After resuscitating me , she propped me up at my desk so I could write this letter . Style Man , this cycling icon must be stopped . What will he try next ? A mirror on his bike ? Fenders ? For God 's sake , STOP THE INSANITY ! ! ! ! Phil Amaya Canby , OR Fret not , Phil , the world is still a safe place . Style Man gives Lance the okay to keep riding : " First , you got ta understand the man is paid to wear those sneaks .

And the Closer : Defeat lifethreatening cancer to win the Tour de France and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you forge your own style possibilities . Our boy could wear pumps and hose and keep it real . " Yesterday afternoon as I put on my spandex shorts and tights , PolarTech top , Gore-Tex jacket and pants , Windstopper socks , balaclava and helmet , I realized what a geek I must look like putting on a rearview mirror that Style Man would n't wear even to avoid a collision with a semi ( Style , March ) . I 'm not sure how BICYCLING spells geek , but the people I know spell it B-1-C-Y-C-L-IS-T . Why disappoint them ? The mirror adds to the geek mystique .
