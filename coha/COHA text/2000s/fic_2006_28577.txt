Chapter One Later , she would ask herself how she could possibly have missed all the danger signals emanating from the man . With the inevitable wisdom of hindsight , she would feel the lazy menace in him as clearly as she now felt her own deeply intrigued response , and Leya Brandon would wonder bitterly why her normally astute mind and intuition had betrayed her . It was to be only the second time in all her twenty-seven years that she had allowed herself to be misled by a man , but Leya would take little comfort from that fact . She rarely needed a second lesson in anything . But for the moment , on the dance floor of the secluded inn on the wild Oregon coast , Leya was n't thinking of the future . The man held her in such an intimate dancing embrace that she was obliged to rest both hands on his broad shoulders . The way he shaped the curve of her waist made it impossible to concentrate on anything but the present . Leya tipped back her neat head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and across her breast , and smiled up into Court Gannon 's sensuously narrowed tortoiseshell eyes . The look she met in the gold-flecked gaze caused her fingertips to flex ever so slightly against the subtly rough texture of his jacket . The inviting , waiting look in Court 's eyes deepened as he felt the small movement on his shoulders . " You feel like a kitten trying to decide whether or not to settle in for the night , " he murmured in soft amusement , turning his head slightly to touch her wrist with his lips . It was the lightest , most teasing of caresses , yet Leya was aware of the small shiver which coursed through her . " Not for the night , " she made herself answer , with a smiling ease that took a surprising amount of effort . The realization that it was going to be difficult to refuse Court 's imminent invitation to share his bed hit her with some force . My God , she thought wonderingly , I 've only known him two days ! " But a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It will be my pleasure to provide the dances , " he growled in his dark , heavily shaded voice . " But I warn you I intend to use the time to my own advantage . " The large , strong hands at Leya 's waist tightened meaningfully and the golden brown eyes gleamed . Leya 's full , generous mouth curved a fraction more as she regarded her partner from beneath thick eyelashes . " Coming from someone who does n't believe in exerting himself unnecessarily , that sounds rather energetic , " she observed teasingly . " The operative word is unnecessarily , " he drawled . " And I 'm coming to the conclusion that having you for an entire night is going to be very necessary , indeed ! " Leya felt the warmth flood her face even as she tried to retain her normally abundant common sense . " There 's a certain lack of subtlety in your approach tonight , " she accused chidingly as she sought for a light way of handling the increasing sensual tension between them . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games were n't going to be necessary between us , Leya , " Court retorted almost gently , his eyes searching her features for the truth of her feelings toward him . " It 's not a question of playing games , Court , " she replied , the smallest of frowns drawing her dark brows slightly toward each other . " It 's a matter of being sure . Why does a man imply a woman is teasing or playing games when she is only trying to test the depths of her own reactions and those of the male involved ? " " Because he 's horribly afraid that if he allows the woman to probe her feelings too deeply , she 'll talk herself out of going to bed with him ! " Court said and grinned candidly . " So he deliberately tries to make her feel guilty by accusing her of being a tease ? " Leya shot back , silver-green eyes deepening with a nonverbal rebuke . " Exactly . Can you blame us ? All 's fair in love and war ! " " Situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have thought you were the type of man who lives by a definite set of principles , " she mocked . " And does n't alter them to fit the situation ? Well , in a sense , you 're right . " He smiled unabashedly . " It 's just that the principles I choose to live by are my own . " " Developed by you and for you ? " " Ummm , " he agreed , his fingers kneading the contour of her lower waist with blatant pleasure . Leya felt the pleasure in his hands as it communicated itself to her and knew she was going to have difficulty when it came time to say goodnight . She refused to think of how difficult it would be when the moment for good-bye came , as it would in only a few short days . But vacation romances , however pleasant , were doomed to appallingly short lives , she told herself firmly . They were meant to be enjoyed on a superficial level and then forgotten - light flirtations that could be ended without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with the knowledge that she had given herself casually to a man who would n't remember her name by the time his next vacation arrived . But regardless of what happened between them , Leya knew she would n't forget Court Gannon 's name for a long , long time . Nor would she forget anything else about the man with the tortoiseshell eyes and matching hair . Large and solidly built without being an ounce overweight , he topped six feet by about one inch , she estimated and she found pleasure in the way his wide shoulders narrowed into a lean waist and strong thighs . There was power in this man , and Leya was honest enough to admit it attracted her . Only later would she tell herself she should have been wary of that primitive attraction . But the mastery and strength were cloaked in what was , for Leya , an enormously appealing laziness and self-control . The variegated deep gold and dark brown of his thick hair was cut short in an apparent effort to tame the broad wave that threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leya had been forced to exercise a degree of control in order to restrain herself from reaching up to thrust curious , sensitive fingers through the curve of that hair . She knew her own weakness for tactile sensations and deliberately avoided the temptation . ( Continues ... )
