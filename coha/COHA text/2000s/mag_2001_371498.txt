Forget the reality whiplash of Sept. 11 ; it was always frivolous to care about the artistic development of Britney Spears . Her promoters may call this album an evolution , but , like all things Britney , it 's no more than a successful diversion that just happens to have titillating words and groans . I 'm a Slave 4 U and I 'm Not a Girl , Not Yet a Woman are rebellious ( but not really , silly ! ) ; Boys offers the wisdom , " Ca n't live with ' em , ca n't live without ' em , " while Let Me Be and the Max Martin-produced Bombastic Love are irresistible pop . So what if it sounds exactly like her other two albums ? Musical evolution will take care of Britney soon enough . <P>  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
