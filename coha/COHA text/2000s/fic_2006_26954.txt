A List by Delilah Darling Friday , April 1 A list . Tony Robbins is telling me I need to make a list . A list of things that are wrong with me . Issues . Problems that need fixing . You see , I do n't have a therapist , so I rely heavily on self-help books ( usually the audio version , downloaded into my iPod ) to work out my problems . I would n't make a list for just any self-help guru , but Tony 's my favorite , not only because he uses sexy phrases like " pathway to power " and " avenue of excellence " but also because he 's freakishly huge and has really white teeth . According to him , if a man with artificial hands can play a piano ( which apparently , he can ) , then a perfectly healthy woman such as myself can overcome a few issues . But first I need to come up with a list . Since I 'm at the office I probably should n't be doing this , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning in twenty minutes so it 's useless to start a new work project . What 's not useless , however , is to start a personal project , so I grab a piece of paper and begin writing . Time is tight , but I think I can finish my list before the meeting begins ; I just need to focus . There , finished . To be honest , this is usually where I stop . Although I sayI " rely heavily " on self-help books , I usually just read/listen to whatever the guru has to say and nod in agreement , like " Yep , that 's me . I sure am a mess ! " I do n't actually take the necessary steps to fix whatever problem I 'm addressing ; I usually lose interest by that point . It 's part of the first thing on my list , not being able to focus . But today is the day I 'm going to change all that . Today is the day I 'm going to explore these issues a bit further . Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't focus is because I have a mild case of undiagnosed ADD . I 'm not sure if ADD just did n't exist when I was younger or if my doctor was a complete moron , but whatever the reason , I 'm pretty sure I have it . For example , I can simultaneously play computer solitaire , read Glamour , instant message multiple people , paint my nails , talk on the phone , and work better than anyone else I know . I call this multitasking . I also have a hard time finishing things I start , like projects , for example . Considering my job title is " project manager , " this can be a bit of a problem . I work at a company called Elisabeth Sterling Design ( ESD for short ) , a company that designs and manufactures a popular line of household products . Elisabeth Sterling , a woman from humble beginnings , started her now-public company just fifteen years ago in a small Harlem studio apartment . She 's an artist who painted modern geometric designs on dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rage in New York City , so much in fact , that she could n't keep up with the demand . Being the savvy businesswoman she was , rather than just hire an apprentice to help keep up , she hired a publicist to create some more hype and then a manufacturer and distributor to produce the dishes in mass quantities . Soon thereafter , Elisabeth Sterling Design was born . To make a long story short , the line that began as dishes today includes just about every household product you can imagine -- from cleaning to decorating to gardening -- and is available exclusively at Target stores across the country . Four years ago , in what has become one of the biggest IPOs in history , Elisabeth took the company public and became a billionaire . Elisabeth Sterling is a household name . Elisabeth Sterling is an icon . But let 's get back to me not focusing . In addition to multitasking and not finishing projects , I tend to go off on tangents and speak in circles . ( I sometimes speak in parentheses too . ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explored one , let 's move on to two . Yes , I feel like I 'm being held back at work , but after rereading what I wrote about my boss being a lying fat pig , I feel like I should address the fact that I 'm a tad judgmental first . I know it 's wrong to judge others , but when it comes to people like Roger , I feel like doing so is justified because he 's a slime ball who once tried to steal an idea from me . About six months ago , I had to come up with a unique color name for a pair of light green oven mitts that my team had just designed ( to Elisabeth nothing is ever just orange , it 's pumpkin or persimmon or harvest moon ) and was looking out the window , staring at the Statue of Liberty when suddenly , it came to me . " Oxidized copper , " I said aloud . Although " oxidized copper " might initially evoke thoughts of something rust-colored , copper turns green when it oxidizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oxidized copper . " It 's a smart and clever color name , and I knew Elisa beth would love it because she 's smart and clever herself . Since Roger is my immediate boss , I report to him , and then he reports to Elisabeth . When he told her about the color name for the mitts , she loved it so much that he somehow ended up taking credit for it . When I found out and confronted him , he started whining pathetically saying , " She did n't give me a chance to explain , and now it 's too late . . . " and blah blah blah . Lucky for me , my best friend and coworker Michelle is a tough cookie from Queens who refused to let Roger get away with what he did . To help me get the credit I deserved , she and her frizzy red hair marched into Roger 's office and demanded that he confess to Elisabeth , saying she had proof that I came up with the color name and not him .
