<p> It may be Friday the 13th , but luck is with us here in Gwinnett . <p> Instead of avoiding broken mirrors and cracks in the sidewalks , Gwinnett Weekend staffers are pointing out 13 reasons we 're lucky to be here . <p> From high-performance academics and athletics , to diversity in food and the arts and endless recreational activities , Gwinnett 's a winner . <p> 1 . Food ! <p> Eat the cuisine of places you may never go and never leave the county . <p> Vietnam , Jamaica , Thailand , heck New Orleans . That 's the benefit of living in Gwinnett . You can have authentic Ecuadoran or Peruvian along Buford Highway . Drive up to Duluth and you 'll find the Super H-Mart where you can get beautiful sushi-grade fish . You might find Bosnian in Lawrenceville or Taiwanese in Norcross . <p> Because the county has steadily drawn a vibrant immigrant community , it has greatly diversified the culinary offerings in the county . But if you 're looking for something a little closer to home , the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metro Atlanta . Two faves : Rexall Grill in Duluth and Hometown Barbeque in Lawrenceville . Both remind you of what 's really good about Southern cooking . <p>  --  Rosalind Bentley , rbentley@ajc.com <p> 2 . High school sports <p> Just a few years ago , perhaps just down the road from your home , with a few dollars , you could have bought a ticket and watched : <p> A future National League All-Star ( Braves catcher Brian McCann , Duluth High School ) ; <p> A future NFL first-round draft pick ( Bengals linebacker David Pollack , Shiloh High School ) ; <p> The future NCAA Division I record holder for most wins by a starting quarterback ( Seahawks quarterback David Greene , South Gwinnett High School ) ; <p> A future Olympic silver medalist ( swimmer Amanda Weir , Brookwood High School ) ; <p> A future member of the U.S. World Cup team ( Josh Wolff of the German Bundesliga league , Parkview High School ) ; <p> And your neighbors ' kids , all playing for schools that routinely win state championships ( 14 last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pros . <p>  --  Ken Sugiura , ksugiura@ajc.com <p> 3 . Public schools <p> To many , Gwinnett County Public Schools mean it 's a lucky place to live . What makes the school district so special ? Well , it 's big . Really big . So big that the district teaches about 10 percent of the public school students living in Georgia . And the school system is the largest employer in metro Atlanta . <p> If size does n't matter , how about success ? Gwinnett 's students routinely beat state and national averages on important tests like the SAT and ACT college entrance exams and the state 's own CRCT . The school district has received awards from countless national organizations lauding the school system for its teachers , administrators , business practices and school construction . <p> What if you do n't care about test scores ? How about music ? Several Gwinnett high school bands and orchestras have received national attention . You can see them for free in your own backyard . How about sports ? Gwinnett high school teams regularly win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well , you get the picture . <p>  --  Laura Diamond , ldiamond@ajc.com <p> 4 . Music <p> When the Arena at Gwinnett Center was built in the Sugarloaf district , it opened up the possibilities of seeing big-name acts in your figurative backyard . And that meant lots less grief from your parents if you wanted to go to a concert on a school night . <p> In the past few years the Arena has hosted A-listers such as Gwen Stefani , the Black Eyed Peas , the Beastie Boys , Toby Keith and George Strait . Some upcoming performers include Christina Aguilera , Martina McBride , My Chemical Romance and Mr. Sexyback himself Justin Timberlake . <p> Another excellent place to hear music is Wild Bill 's in Duluth , a 70,000-square-foot party palace that has won reader and industry awards for best music and dancing . Terri Clark and Joe Nichols are scheduled to perform April 20 and 27 , respectively , at the venue that bills itself as " America 's Largest Country Music Dance Club and Concert Hall . " Besides visiting artists , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric Key , Kyle Jennings , Cori Jean and Cory Sellers with The 35 Cent Rodeo . Along with its country acts , Wild Bill 's also has hip-hop and dance music theme nights . <p>  --  Chuck O'Briant , cobriant@ajc.com <p> 5 . Stone Mountain Park <p> OK , it 's just over the border in DeKalb . But it 's so-o-o close ! <p> From jogging trails to wonderful vistas to laser light shows , Stone Mountain Park offers something for everyone , in every season . During cooler months , on days when the air is clear , you can follow a trail to the top and practically see all the way to Alabama . Or you can take a sky ride to the top if walking uphill seems too daunting . <p> You can play golf while children enjoy various activities in an 1870 barn and play outside in treehouses . You can take a paddle boat ride or hop on the railroad to tour the park . <p> At Christmas , you can visit the 1870s small town of Crossroads , ready for the holidays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts and special events year-round . <p> And it 's a wonderful place to jog , walk and relax . <p> Do n't forget to take in the large granite carving of Robert E. Lee , Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson , the largest high relief sculpture in the world . <p>  --  Rebecca McCarthy , rmccarthy@ajc.com <p> 6 . Youth sports <p> The sports programs run through the Gwinnett County Parks and Recreation Department are vast . <p> Children play in 17 county parks , in dozens of leagues , on hundreds of teams . At those parks last year , 18,000 kids played baseball and softball , 13,000 played soccer , 7,500 played basketball , 5,500 played football and there were 3,000 cheerleaders . <p> Not surprisingly , the programs form highly organized feeder systems for the county 's high school teams . Youth football teams , even down to the six-year-old teams , often run the same plays and use the same terminology as the high school team . <p> On top of that , the Gwinnett County Swim League had more than 6,300 swimmers turning laps last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gladiators <p> It seems there are at least two certainties in Gwinnett . One is traffic congestion . The other is the Gladiators hockey team making the playoffs . <p> The Glads have made the postseason each of their first four seasons at the Gwinnett Arena . They 'll start their playoff run Saturday night at the arena against the Texas Wildcatters . <p> The team averages about 5,600 fans per game with about 2,000 season-ticket holders . Tickets range from $11 to $20 , the parking is free and it 's a lot closer ( and cheaper ) than the Thrashers downtown . <p> " Until you go and see how fun an actual game is , you 're missing out on a lot , " said Missy Martin of Sugar Hill , a season-ticket holder and president of the booster club . " For families , you really ca n't beat it because it really is affordable . " <p>  --  Ken Sugiura , ksugiura@ajc.com <p> 8 . Gwinnett Arena <p> Its full name is the Arena at Gwinnett Center . Whatever its name , it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About 3.1 million people have come through the doors at 6400 Sugarloaf Parkway in Duluth to see the likes of Bruce Springsteen , George Strait , Eric Clapton and a litany of sporting events . <p> Fans of the arena enjoy the free , secured parking and rave that there are n't any bad seats . <p> " I go to just about everything , " said She Fischbach , a personal trainer from Suwanee . " It 's close and it 's fun and everyone 's always so nice and takes good care of you . " <p> The arena brings in about 140 events annually . Upcoming are Christian rock band MercyMe ( April 20 ) and Cirque du Soleil ( June 8-9 ) . <p>  --  Ken Sugiura , ksugiura@ajc.com <p> 9 . Theater <p> Gwinnettians are so fortunate when it comes to theater . The state has only a handful of professional theaters and Gwinnett is home to two of them , The Aurora Theatre in Lawrenceville and Red Clay Theatre in Duluth . <p> The Aurora , which will move into its glorious new building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized regionally for the great depth of its musical talent . Just think of last year 's production of " A Year With Frog and Toad " or " Guys and Dolls " and you 'll know why last year , even with the fits and starts of its move to new digs , the theater saw an uptick in its audience numbers . Red Clay is the newest guy on the block , whose distinct but risky mission is to bring shows that have had successful runs inside the perimeter to downtown Duluth . <p> And do n't forget the myriad community theater groups that are bringing shows to the four corners of the county , for example Lionheart Theatre in Norcross . Next week , beginning April 20 , Lionheart opens its production of " Radio TBS , Trailerpark Broadcasting Scandals . " The title says it all : gossip and laughs . <p>  --  Rosalind Bentley , rbentley@ajc.com <p> 10 . Lakes and rivers <p> There 's water everywhere , with access to Lake Lanier  --  one of the country 's most popular lakes  --  and the Chattahoochee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50-year-old lake offers opportunities for water sports like wind surfing and water-skiing , along with camping , bass fishing , sailing and pleasure cruising . <p> Lake Lanier Islands includes a popular waterpark , resorts and a golf course . <p> Just below Buford Dam in the northern tip of the county , the lake once again becomes the Chattahoochee River  --  a valuable resource that meanders through the metro area , beckoning boaters , hikers and fishermen . <p>  --  Marcia Langhenry , mlanghenry@ajc.com <p> 11 . Proximity <p> If the Gwinnett Arena does n't satisfy your concert and sports needs , then Atlanta venues ranging from the cozy Tabernacle to the grand-scale HiFi Buys Amphitheater or Philips Arena are a short trip down I-85 or on MARTA . In about a 30-minute drive you can see professional sports of the football variety ( Falcons and Force ) at the Georgia Dome , hockey ( Thrashers ) and basketball ( Hawks ) at Philips and the Braves at the Ted . Philips Arena has concerts on par with Gwinnett Arena and sometimes an artist will play both venues in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And when the weather warms up HiFi Buys hosts concerts and festivals such as OzzFest , 99x 's Big Day Out and the all-day extravaganza that is Jimmy Buffett . <p>  --  Chuck O'Briant , cobriant@ajc.com <p> 12 . Those Dawgs <p> Lucky proximity also comes into play at Athens sporting events . If you are a University of Georgia alumnus or just a fan of college sports , then a quick drive up 316 , or Highway 78 from Snellville puts you in the Classic City . <p> Nothing compares to the spectacle of a fall football Saturday with thousands of red and black clad tailgaters and students dressed to impress . The football team is a perennial power under Mark Richt , the gymastics team is routinely in the national title hunt along with the swimming and diving teams and the men 's hoops team is resurgent after a down period . Even a Georgia Tech fan would have to agree that Athens offers excellent SEC and national competition that can be seen in a day and have you home by bedtime . One of the best parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the place  --  only 40 minutes away , it feels like a different world . <p>  --  Chuck O'Briant , cobriant@ajc.com <p> 13 . Parks <p> Greenspace and recreational activities abound , despite Gwinnett 's dramatic population and building booms . <p> County parks are keeping up thanks to voter-approved special purpose local option sales taxes earmarked for capital improvements . <p> The map already is dotted with relaxing spots for a quiet walk , places to take your pooch , play tennis , disc golf or baseball , or take a swim , indoors or out . <p> Little Mulberry Park in Auburn offers the most room to roam and includes trails for people and horses and a lake for fishing . <p> More parks and facilities are in the works , including the Harbins-Alcovy Park site . Its 1,795 acres will make it the county 's largest park when its hiking and horse-riding trails are completed next year . <p>  --  Marcia Langhenry , mlanghenry@ajc.com Photo : NICK ARROYO / StaffThe back tail lights of a schoolbus. /ImageData* ImageData* Photo : Stone Mountain ParkA carnival in the parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hockey puck/ImageData* ImageData* Photo : Aurora TheatreTeresa DeBerry and Shelly McCook star in the Aurora Theatre 's production of " Glorious !
