Section : 2006 Investment Guide Flings How to run a lodge in the wilds of Africa . <p> DAYS AFTER FORMER BOND trader Barry John van der Maas moved to eastern Zambia in May 2001 , he paid court to Senior Chief Nsefu of the Kunda tribe . Word of the young Briton 's arrival had already spread , so Van der Maas drove 12 dusty miles to the chief 's village , knelt on one leg before the sitting chief and clapped in three sets of three . Once invited to shake the chief 's hand , Van der Maas , then 27 , explained he had acquired a lease on land just outside Zambia 's South Luangwa National Park where he planned to run a safari lodge . <p> Van der Maas ' four-room , eight-guest Luangwa River Lodge is now nearly finished . It is a one-hour flight from Zambia 's capital , Lusaka . It borders the country 's second-most-popular tourist destination , the national park at the southern end of the Great Rift Valley , which is home to the meandering Luangwa River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some as high as 15 feet ) and even taller baobab trees . There are also leopards , lions , giraffes , antelope , monkeys , buffalo , hippos , crocodiles and 400 species of birds . <p> To build a luxury lodge from scratch on this hideaway , Van der Maas , his fashion-designer wife , Tara , and brother Sean spent $850,000 . The design , engineering , carpentry , bricklaying and final touches took more than three years before the first guest could arrive . The Van der Maases lived out of a tent for the first six months and trekked as far as Johannesburg , a four-day drive , in search of fabric , mattresses , fixtures , plugs , sockets , plumbing and 60 tons of wooden poles treated against termites . Van der Maas hired 30 laborers to clear a dirt road through the bush so he could bring three loaded trucks into camp . <p> The lodge is now replete with five-star features like electricity , spa-style baths and high ceilings . Filet mignon and freshly baked bread grace the menu . Van der @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to drive 12 hours one way to Lusaka for items like champagne . <p> Van der Maas charges $400 per person per night ( including food , alcohol and park fees ) for the first three nights . He says that in his first operating year , beginning September 2004 , revenue was $382,000 from an occupancy rate that was 40% in the early rainy season through December and 75% January through June . Costs for food , marketing and 20 full-time employees were $145,000 . Van der Maas is spending another $150,000 to add a family-size suite and to buy more vehicles ; with a swamp cruiser he can drive guests across the river into the park and cut out a 30-minute detour to a bridge . Of the $87,000 left over , he 'll keep $50,000 tax free ( a concession to inward investors ) to start to recoup the investment and pay 35% corporate tax on the other $37,000 . <p> He says he hopes to recover the investment in five years . Some of the return he will be happy to take in kind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do wonders for the soul , " says Van der Maas . <p> Believe it or not , Van der Maas had it relatively easy . In October 2000 he was able to buy an embryonic safari lodge project from an Englishman who had fallen ill before being able to realize his own dream . For $100,000 Van der Maas got a 99-year lease on 80 acres of land and a big head start , including years of negotiating with the preceding chieftain and obtaining permission from the Zambia Wildlife Authority , the Zambia National Tourist Board and the Zambia Ministry of Lands to put up accommodations for up to 24 guests . The deal even included a government investment license ( still honored though the program ended ) that allows Van der Maas tax-free imports worth up to $700,000 ( he has $400,000 left ) . This all saved him years . " Nothing happens quickly in Africa , " says Van der Maas . " There 's lots of red tape . " <p> One of the biggest obstacles in this kind of adventure is finding reliable help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ordered , or a guard to keep animals out of a chalet , if asked . Susan W. Mathis , a 66-year-old Atlantan who owns Mateya Safari in the Madikwe Game Reserve , a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Johannesburg , recommends hiring an on-site manager who is knowledgeable about the way things work in Africa . As a woman , she had trouble getting workers to listen to her at first . " This is a man 's world over here , " she says . <p> It can take years to find the right land for a lodge . Van der Maas had stayed in 45 inns throughout southern Africa , learning about different countries and comparing large high-end lodges against small bush camps . He says similar plots in Botswana and Namibia could have cost upwards of $500,000 . He had his eye on a beach resort in Mozambique at one point , but floods ravaged the country in 2000 . Though not on his list , Kenya makes land ownership hard for noncitizens . Ancestral land claims can also be an issue in some countries . <p> Zambia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists visited , spending $153 million , according to the Zambia National Tourist Board . That 's one-third more visitors and 79% more money than just five years ago . Pay close attention to the sometimes tenuous political situations . Zambia is benefiting from the international opprobrium of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe , its southern neighbor . Be cognizant of currencies . South Africa 's rand has risen by as much as 18% in the past 12 months against the dollar . <p> Last year Van der Maas spent $20,000 on photos , brochures , a Web site and attending travel shows like the World Travel Market in London . He exchanges e-mails with 250 potential guests and agents a day , answering questions about flights , inoculations , war and disease . To accommodate guests , he sometimes doubles as an agent . John and Amy LaBadia , 29-year-olds from Hoboken , N.J. who spent three nights of their honeymoon at the Luangwa River Lodge this summer , paid Van der Maas $5,300 for a trip that included not just the stay at his lodge but also three nights at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights within Zambia . Taking a 10% service fee , Van der Maas estimates he brings in an additional $10,000 a year this way . <p> Most important , know what you are getting into . " If you think you 're going to escape from the city with your newfound millions from the stock market , be prepared for backbreaking work of a different nature , " says Tim C. Lapage , owner of Safari Experts , a safari planner in Park City , Utah . A small business is still a demanding small business , however breathtaking its surroundings . <p> RULES OF ENGAGEMENT <p> Thinking of throwing it all in and setting up in the wilds on your own ? Bear these points in mind : <p> Scout wisely . The region is rife with tenuous political situations . You need a location where you can run a business and to which guests will come . Be patient . It can take years to cut through African red tape . Your guests will expect the conveniences of Western life , but you should n't expect to find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the ropes . Be versatile . You 'll do every job from construction hand to travel agent . Enjoy the adventure . It is your life as much as your living . <p> <p> MAP : ZAMBIA , AFRICA <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Taking a break : The Van der Maases at Luangwa river Lodge . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Allison Fass <p>
