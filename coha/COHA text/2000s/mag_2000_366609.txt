The conductor 's baton comes to a dramatic halt . The orchestra 's final note rings in the air . There is a split second of awed silence , then thunderous applause as the audience expresses its appreciation . <P> To a mathematician 's ears , there is something else going on . Typically , after a few seconds of chaotic clapping , an audience will slip into synchronized applause , like two people adjusting their strides until they walk in step . But just as walkers will reassert their natural gait , a clap-happy audience will fall in and out of synch repeatedly . According to a study of ovations in Romania and Hungary , this back-and-forthing is due to conflicting needs : the wish to make the most possible noise ( random clapping ) vs. the urge to clap in unison . People switch from one to the other by consciously adjusting the speed of their applause . Why do some folks seem to play this game with such gusto ? According to the study , published last week in Nature , it may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd that feels like one claps like one . <P>  --  By David Bjerklie
