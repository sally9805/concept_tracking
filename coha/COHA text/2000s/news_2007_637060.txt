<p> Hardeeville , S.C .  --  With international trade zooming and bistate animosity festering , the governors of Georgia and South Carolina pledged Monday to jointly build a port in the Palmetto State on land owned by the Peach State . <p> Gov . Sonny Perdue of Georgia joined his South Carolina counterpart , Mark Sanford , in announcing an unusual compact between usually competitive neighbors for the creation of an 1,800-acre deep-water port in this Lowcountry community struggling to create jobs . <p> Neither governor gave a firm timeline for completion of the proposed Jasper County Maritime Terminal nor projected the taxpayer cost to build a port from scratch . <p> Yet their decision to set aside decades of commercial one-upmanship for the possibility of tens of thousands of jobs and millions in revenues signaled a new degree of cooperation . <p> Perdue , standing atop a berm overlooking the Savannah River on the Georgia side , told his fellow Republican Sanford that " we will work with you for the economic prosperity of both our states . " <p> " We 've both seen phenomenal growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've only just begun , " Perdue added . " This is not about tomorrow , but about 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years in the future . " <p> Questions remain about the impact on the business of nearby ports and the environment . <p> Georgia officials on hand Monday praised the pact as beneficial to all parties , and the agreement said taxpayers should not fear their investments in the existing ports at Savannah and Charleston will be hurt by a new port . <p> Environmental groups , watchful whether the plan would affect plans to deepen the river , took a wait-and-see approach . <p> The lack of a firm timeline worries Jasper County officials , who had previously signed a port development deal with a private company . Both states , eager to keep control of any future lucrative port , have kept Jasper from realizing that dream . <p> Critics grumbled that Monday 's agreement allows Georgia and South Carolina to build the port on their schedule once the busy ports in Savannah and Charleston run out of room to grow . <p> Gladys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critic of the port development process , seemed mollified Monday . <p> " We butted heads before because we could n't get a commitment , " she said as the sun bore down on the shade-less riverbank . " But this is more encouragement than we 've had . We will trust them totally  --  until we hear otherwise . " <p> For years , the Georgia Department of Transportation has owned nearly 1,800 acres on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River , using the parcel to dump muck dredged from the river . The site , about seven miles below downtown Savannah , is barren yet sits alongside a deep channel suitable for today 's massive cargo ships carrying as many as 6,000 containers . <p> Traffic at Savannah 's port has grown by double digits each of the past five years due largely to trade with China . It handled 2.2 million containers last year . It has also surpassed Charleston to become the East Coast 's second-largest container port after New York-New Jersey . <p> With Pacific Coast ports nearing capacity , and with China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower East Coast can justify another port , said shipping consultant John Vickerman . <p> " From a macroeconomic standpoint , we will need as many oars in the water as we can , " said Vickerman , a founding principal of TranSystems Corp . in Kansas City , Mo . <p> New container ports are being built from whole cloth near Halifax , Nova Scotia , and Wilmington , N.C. Also , Hampton Roads , Va. , and Jacksonville are boosting their ports as competitors plan for the " tsunami , " as Vickerman put it , in Asian imports . <p> Over the next decade , Savannah and Charleston will also hugely increase their port facilities . But within 15 years , according to authority officials , both ports will likely reach their trading capacity . <p> Enter Jasper . <p> Stevedoring Services of America , a Seattle-based port builder , has offered to buy the Georgia dredge site for $8.5 million , lease it back to Jasper County and build berths , warehouses and a road . SSA suggested a minimum of $350 million would be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell the land , Jasper in 2001 tried to condemn it . The South Carolina Supreme Court sided with Georgia , but that did n't keep the S.C . Ports Authority from suing to seek control of the land . <p> In January , a S.C . lower court judge ruled that South Carolina holds first rights to condemn the land . <p> Monday 's announcement will most likely render moot further legal challenges . <p> " By coming together we both give up something , " Sanford said . " We give up our suit against Georgia and they give up the claim to land . ... Both will walk away with half of the project . But nobody walks away with the whole . " <p> Highlights of the agreement include : <p> * The Bi-State Port Authority will own , develop and jointly operate the new port . Each state will control half of the authority , modeled after the New York-New Jersey Port Authority . <p> * Georgia 's Department of Transportation is authorized to sell the 1,800-acre parcel to the authority . <p> * Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * A six-member task force  --  three from Georgia , three from South Carolina  --  will shepherd the land acquisition , permitting and development process . <p> * Private companies , including SSA , will be allowed to bid for development and management contracts . <p> * Both states ' legislatures must approve the deal . Congress must sign off on the joint compact . <p> * The authority will petition the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to relocate the dredge dumping site so the port can be built . <p> The authority , and legislatures , will now " cooperate together to deepen the channel , " the agreement states . Savannah wants to deepen the river channel to 48 feet so larger ships can reach the Garden City Terminal . Federal agencies are studying the environmental impact of a deeper Savannah River . <p> " You could make an interesting case that we ought to only deepen the river to the Jasper terminal , " said Will Berson , a coastal policy analyst with the Georgia Conservancy . " If you can limit the amount of deepening , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be a very destructive thing to have a lot of port investment on two sides of the river . " <p> A LITANY OF CONFLICT <p> * December 2000 : Private company offers $8.5 million to buy property , lease it back to Jasper County for a port . <p> * January 2001 : Jasper officials condemn property after the owner , the state of Georgia , refuses to sell . <p> * September 2003 : Georgia wins appeal to S.C . Supreme Court , which says the county could not condemn the land . <p> * January 2005 : Jasper officials seek to condemn property for second time . South Carolina Ports Authority sues , seeking control of the property . <p> * January 2007 : A lower court judge rules the S.C . Ports Authority has first rights to condemn the land . <p> * Last week : South Carolina House passes a bill to give that state three years of exclusive rights to build a Jasper port .
