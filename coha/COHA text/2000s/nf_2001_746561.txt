When new federal legislation goes into effect , lawyers may hardly recognize bankruptcy law , Here is a primer on the changes . <p> Attorneys will find themselves in unfamiliar territory when changes to the bankruptcy law take effect within the next few months . <p> Indeed , if bankruptcy legislation now in the final stages of consideration by Congress passes in its present form , lawyers can expect to wipe the slate clean of much of what they know about representing bankrupt consumer debtors . Other areas of bankruptcy will also be affected by the legislation , but to a lesser extent . <p> A primary intent of the legislation is to make it harder for consumer debtors to discharge debts under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankrupcty Code . Instead , more debtors will be forced into Chapter 13 repayment plans . <p> In doing so , the legislation is likely to impose greater burdens on lawyers who represent debtors in bankruptcy . <p> One of the changes would require lawyers to certify the financial statements of their clients . The provision imposes civil penalties on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dismissed because the bankruptcy trustee finds that the debtor does not qualify for total debt relief . <p> The provision also will hold attorneys responsible for certifying the accuracy of information their clients provide under a new means test that will be used to determine whether debtors are eligible for debt discharge under Chapter 7 or whether they must repay some portion of their debt under Chapter 13 . <p> The harshness of these provisions has some lawyers considering getting out of the bankruptcy business altogether . <p> " The things I 'm really worried about in this bill are the means test and the certification , " says Shayna Steinfeld , a bankruptcy attorney in Atlanta . " I 'm going to have to think long and hard about staying in this area of law . " <p> The ABA 's General Practice , Solo and Small Firm Section is sending a letter to members of Congress protesting the certification provision . The provision casts lawyers in the role of " furniture appraisers rather than counselors , " states the letter written by Larry B. Feinstein of ' Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The letter does not express policy of the ABA ; the section was authorized to send it under the ABA 's blanket authority policy that permits association entities to address issues within their fields of expertise . ) <p> Elaborating on the letter , Feinstein says , " No lawyer in his or her right mind would attempt to handle a Chapter 7 case with this provision in place . Why would you put yourself in the position of being personally liable over a potential $900 fee case ? " <p> These concerns typify the kinds of adjustments attorneys are likely to face in handling bankruptcy cases , especially those involving individuals , once the new bankruptcy legislation finally goes into effect . <p> Although the legislation has wide bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate , it has stalled short of final passage , a victim of the political stalemate in Congress . After both chambers passed bankruptcy bills early this year , final passage was delayed because the Senate Republicans and Democrats , each with 50 members , could not agree on how to appoint members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate and House versions of the legislation . That stalemate was expected to end by mid-June after the defection of Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords from the Republican ranks swung control of the Senate to the Democrats . A final bill is expected to be sent this summer to President Bush , who has said he would sign it . <p> Federal lawmakers have been keen for years to change bankruptcy laws they consider too lenient , allowing people with some means to pay their bills to walk away scot-free . Bankruptcies have been on the rise for at least two decades , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute , reaching 1.3 million in 1999  --  more than 97 percent of them filed by individuals rather than businesses . <p> But critics of the bills say the piecemeal nature of the provisions will result in a bill that makes bankruptcy nearly impossible for those who need it most . They warn that the legislation could result in overburdened courts , a rise in the number of debtors who default on court-ordered payment plans , and a system in chaos . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest credit issuers to cut their losses after extending credit to high-risk recipients in recent years . Hammering Away <p> Banks , businesses and other credit card issuers have pointed to cases where wealthy debtors have wiped out their debts with hardly a crimp in their jet-set lifestyles . Others , however , suggest that in many cases bankruptcy is triggered by such catastrophic events as job loss , illness or divorce . <p> " This is simply too heavy a hammer to solve that problem , " says David A. Greer of Norfolk , Va. , who chairs the Consumer Bankruptcy Committee of the ABA Section of Business Law . Law professor Bruce A. Markell of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas School of Law is even more direct in his evaluation of the proposed changes . He says fewer debtors will be able to afford lawyers in bankruptcy proceedings because bankruptcy lawyers will increase their fees as their own risks in handling cases go up . <p> Consequently , fewer people will file bankruptcy , but that does n't mean that more people will pay their bills , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remain nearly untraceable to creditors . <p> " It 's a zero-sum game , " says Markell . " Businesses will eventually find that by making people pay more to service old debt , they are keeping them from buying new things . There 's only so much money in each pocket , and you ca n't get more than what somebody 's got . " <p> But Joe Rubin , director of legislative affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , says the bill does not dramatically change the circumstances under which a debtor who is truly insolvent can discharge his or her debts . " The bill does n't make a significantly greater amount of debt nondischargeable , " he says , but rather provides that those who can pay at least some of their debts will be forced to do so . <p> To address some of the criticism that credit providers have brought their problems on themselves , the legislation would : <p>  --  Require studies to determine whether issuers of credit cards are offering credit without sufficient regard to the consumer 's ability to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repayment . <p>  --  Prohibit issuers from canceling accounts of consumers who pay off their cards in full every month . <p>  --  Recommend a Federal Reserve study into the relationship between credit card debt amassed in college and bankruptcy . <p> Even as Congress sorts out its political logjam and the final details of the bankruptcy legislation , attorneys are trying to forecast what the new law will mean not only for debtors and creditors but for the attorneys who represent them , as well . Turn to Chapter 13 <p> The biggest changes in the bankruptcy system under the new legislation system from efforts to push more debtors into Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 7 . <p> One of those steps introduces a formal process of means testing designed to ferret out Chapter 7 filers who would be able to repay some of their debts under Chapter 13 . <p> Both Senate and House versions of the legislation provide for means testing of assets , debts and average monthly income to determine whether a debtor has some ability to repay unsecured obligations . Both bills set allowances for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment under guidelines similar to those used by the Internal Revenue Service to determine a debtor 's ability to repay delinquent taxes . The IRS guidelines set allowances on a regional or local basis , and any income left after these items are paid for is presumed to be available for debt repayment . <p> The biggest problem with this approach in the bankruptcy context , says Greer , is that someone whose mortgage or rent payment might be somewhat above their geographical average would bear the burden of proving why the higher amount should be allowed . <p> Failure to satisfy this burden could result in a portion of the money the debtor spends on housing costs being applied to debt repayment . In an extreme case , he says , this could result in a debtor being forced to move to cheaper housing or risk defaulting on a court-ordered repayment plan . <p> The means test generally establishes a formula for determining how much will be left to repay debt after certain allowable expenses are deducted from the debtor 's income . Under the formula , remaining income of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $166.67 per month ) would result in a dismissal of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing . The debtor would then have to choose between Chapter 13 and forgoing bankruptcy protection . When a debtor exceeds the $10,000 limit , fraud may be implied if the debtor 's income exceeds the median income in the debtor 's state , which can result in additional penalties . The legislation calls for random audits of bankruptcy filings . <p> Bankruptcy attorneys are concerned that the means test will be an area in which attorney certification of financial information provided by the client could trigger liability for the attorney when that information is rejected by the bankruptcy trustee . <p> Under the new statute , the courts are required to impose civil penalties on attorneys found to be in violation of Rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy , which requires accuracy of pleadings . <p> Attorneys also would be subject to loss of fees , damages , injunctive remedies and imposition of costs for any failure to meet new disclosure and record-keeping requirements regarding debtors ' assets , debts and expenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a specialty than it is now , " says Samuel Gerdano , executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute in Alexandria , Va . " There will be fewer attorneys dabbling in the occasional case , because the potential pitfalls will be just too great . " <p> The new legislation would give creditors more opportunities to challenge a debtor 's choice of which bills to reaffirm and which to discharge , and even to challenge the debtor 's calculations under the means test and push for a hearing on whether the debtor should be forced into Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 7 . <p> The result of the means test and the audit requirement will be more work for the courts , says Gerdano . Although the bills call for more bankruptcy judges , case backlogs could build as courts attempt to sort out issues arising out of means testing . Home Sweet Exemption <p> A related issue awaiting resolution by the conference committee is a homestead exemption that would set a cap on the equity a homeowner/debtor could protect when filing for bankruptcy . <p> Homestead exemptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few states , including Texas , Florida and Kansas , have been criticized for allowing some wealthy debtors to shield much of their assets in expensive mansions . <p> The new federal legislation would set a cap on homestead exemptions . The Senate version sets a $125,000 limit on the amount of equity a debtor can hold in a home . The House version sets a $100,000 limit , but would exempt a home that a debtor purchased more than two years before declaring bankruptcy . Equity rolled over from another house in the same state would be exempted from the two-year limit . <p> Some senators from states that have no limits on homestead exemptions have threatened to withhold support for legislation that contains a federal cap . Reports from Washington suggest , however , that the conference committee is likely to set a homestead cap but limit its application to homes purchased within one to three years prior to the date of filling for bankruptcy . <p> Markell expresses concern that the proposed federal cap , which is aimed at home purchases intended to shield assets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new state for legitimate reasons but then find themselves forced by unexpected circumstances , such as job loss or medical bills , to file for bankruptcy . <p> The legislation contains a cap of $1 million on the amount of retirement income a debtor will be able to shield . While income from 401K accounts will not be included in calculating this amount , the cap will likely apply to most IRA savings ( education IRAs will be among the exceptions ) , as well as pensions and other retirement vehicles . Critics charge that the provision helps wealthy debtors but does little for low-income debtors who are insolvent and can not even manage to save for retirement . <p> While issues like the homestead exemption have been getting the most attention , the new legislation , which runs to some 400 pages , contains a number of more obscure provisions that will impact how bankruptcy law is practiced : <p> Child support . Under the new law , court-ordered child support and alimony payments would no longer be stayed during the pendency of a bankruptcy estate , and would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses in administering the estate . On the down side , however , such payments would no longer enjoy higher priority than property tax liens . <p> So , when a debtor owes both property taxes and family support , any proceeds from a sale of the liened property will first go to pay the property taxes , then to support . Because the bill makes family support a priority over the bankruptcy trustee 's fees , says Shayna Steinfeld , the trustee has little incentive to force the debtor to sell certain assets if there is an outstanding support obligation , since the trustee may not get paid for administering a sale if all the money ends up going to the support obligation . <p> Another provision in the Senate version says that people filing bankruptcy do not have to declare a spouse 's income in a bankruptcy petition if they were legally separated at the time of filing . <p> Evictions . The legislation would make it easier for landlords to evict ; bankrupt tenants who are behind on their rent , even before the bankruptcy estate is closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this provision , but small business advocates say that too many renters currently abuse the bankruptcy laws by filing cases to stay eviction proceedings and then voluntarily dismissing their bankruptcies before the hearing date , thus buying themselves extra time in their apartments . <p> Judgments . A provision in the Senate version would bar the discharge of court-ordered judgments . Known as the " abortion clinic violence amendment , " this provision was inserted at the behest of pro-choice advocates who have been awarded judgments against people who bombed or committed other violence at abortion clinics . In the past , some of them have avoided paying large damage judgments by filing for bankruptcy . <p> Luxury goods . Both versions of the legislation would render nondischargeable purchases of luxury goods over a certain threshold amount in the months right before filing bankruptcy . <p> In the House version , luxury purchases of more than $250 made within 90 days of filing , or cash advances of more than $750 sought within 70 days prior to filing would have to be repaid . The Senate version limits the threshold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing . <p> Secured debts . If a debtor reaffirms a secured debt , such as a car loan , the debtor would be required to repay the full amount of the loan . Reaffirmations of unsecured debt would require court approval in most circumstances . Many debtors may nevertheless choose to reaffirm if the creditor promises to provide additional credit after the bankruptcy , says Samuel Gerdano , since refusal to reaffirm may simply mean that the debtor is ordered to repay a substantial portion of the loan under a repayment plan but loses the opportunity for additional credit . <p> Debt counseling . Debtors would have to sign affidavits attesting that they have received debt counseling prior to filing for bankruptcy . <p> It may not make much difference , however . A study by the American Bankruptcy Institute found that debtors who receive counseling in conjunction with a Chapter 13 bankruptcy are only slightly more likely to complete their repayments than debtors who do not receive counseling  --  and fewer than half of the people in either group comply with their court-ordered repayment schedules . More Change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation is bringing to the consumer bankruptcy rules , it will also affect bankruptcies of small businesses under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code . <p> Professor Bruce Markell estimates that small businesses accounted for about 80 percent of some 10,000 Chapter 11 filings last year ( there were some 1.3 million consumer filings in 1999 , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute ) . It took an average of 13 months for companies filing under Chapter 11 to file a plan of reorganization to allow them to continue to do business , according to Markell . <p> That work will have to be completed within a year of filing for bankruptcy , under the new legislation . The legislation also would require Chapter 11 debtors to file monthly profitability and tax statements during reorganization . <p> The new requirements and deadlines are going to put additional pressures on businesses already struggling to stay alive , says Markell . " It will become very difficult for a lawyer to competently represent a small business where there are family-ownership dispute issues , or a creditor intent on challenging filings , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly impossible to settle disputes in time to file a reorganization plan . <p> But Joe Rubin of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says small businesses will experience some upside from the legislation because it should be easier for them to collect on outstanding credit accounts as more consumers declare bankruptcy under Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 7 . <p> Most provisions of the new bankruptcy legislation will take effect 180 days after the president signs the law , but Markell says it may not take much longer than that for discussions to begin about further changes in bankruptcy law . He predicts that further legislative changes will be made over the next five years or so to iron out difficulties and fill gaps in the new law . <p> Markell also suggests that there may be some rethinking about some of the get-tough provisions in the legislation that may foster renewed discussion about what the underlying purpose of the bankruptcy system should be . <p> " At the end of the day , " he says , " it comes down to what sort of a society do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or one that keeps them from becoming productive again ? " <p> ' There will be fewer attorneys dabbling in the occasional case . ' Samuel Gerdano <p> <p> ' This is simply too heavy a hammer to solve ' bankruptcies .
