<p> AGUADULCE , PANAMA - One-year-old Carlos Alejandro Lee plays on the living-room floor with Matchbox cars . His father fiddles with his cell phone a few feet away . His grandfather calls out from the patio . <p> Taking a brief rest from a day of chasing cattle , the older Lees jokingly taunt each other in a familiar game of one-upmanship . <p> The grandfather , Carlos Lee , a provincial all-star in Panama , boasts of being the best baseball player in the family . The father , Carlos Noriel Lee , the newest Astros slugger , simply wags his finger in disagreement . The six-year , $100 million major-league contract he recently signed is all the validation he needs . <p> Lee , 30 , drew his $100 million with a powerful swing that has averaged 98 runs driven in over his eight-year major-league career , providing promise that he will fortify the middle of the batting order behind fellow All-Star Lance Berkman . The Astros have had one of the most anemic offenses in baseball the past two years , but Lee should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs per season during his time with the Chicago White Sox , Milwaukee Brewers and Texas Rangers . <p> The two older Lees already have earned their place in the pantheon of Panamanian baseball , and Carlos Noriel is poised to become the greatest major-leaguer the country has produced . <p> But baseball is only part of the legacy they wish to leave the boy playing on the floor . They also want to be the best breeders of Brahman cattle in Panama , perhaps even all of the Americas . <p> And it is in Texas where these aspirations intersect . <p> Long before Astros owner Drayton McLane signed Carlos Noriel to the richest contract in the franchise 's history , Lee had made it known to several top Texas cattlemen that his preference was to land in Houston via free agency because of a ranch and a bull he owns in nearby Wharton County . <p> Latin American society places tremendous stock in the virtues of humility and hard work , so the 56-year-old patriarch beams at the reputation his son enjoys for both in their small town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off their banter and head back to their ranches , their horses , their cattle , their work . <p> Carlos Alejandro plays with his cars . <p> Ranch in Wharton County <p> Home for Lee is this small sugar-cane town in the Panamanian province of Cocle , 86 miles from the capital , Panama City . <p> But the cradle of his dreams and ambitions as a cattleman is on a 1,000-acre ranch in the Wharton County town of Boling , about an hour southwest of Houston . <p> That 's where you 'll find 4-year-old Mr. V8 960/5 , the 2006 Brahman Grand Champion at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo , an animal that Lee co-owns with two other Texas ranchers . <p> Lee has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars laying the foundation for his herd , and countless hours researching the best bloodlines and breeding techniques available to produce the best Brahman , a breed best identified by the hump on its shoulders and known for its docile character . <p> The embryos and semen used at his Cristo Ranch in Panama , one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a laboratory on the property to house the microscopes , refrigeration equipment and medicine needed . <p> " This is what I do all day , " he says as he rushes in his King Ranch F-350 truck to check on a calf born a few hours earlier . <p> Winning the grand championship at the Houston livestock show last year was a milestone . <p> " When I told Carlos 960/5 was the grand champion at the Houston livestock championship , he was very excited , " said Jim Williams , co-owner of the V8 Ranch . " That 's the International Brahman Show , the largest Brahman show in the world . It 'd be like winning the Super Bowl or winning the World Series . " <p> In the nearly three years since they met , Williams has seen how far Lee has come as a cattleman . " Carlos is not only a good baseball player , but he 's also the most progressive breeder in Panama as far as importing top genetics , " Williams said . " He probably knows the pedigree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics . " <p> Although baseball has helped Lee build his businesses , McLane thinks Lee would have become a successful businessman in Panama regardless . <p> " He 's one of the smartest and probably the most business-savvy baseball player I 've ever spoken to , " McLane says of Lee . " He is up there with Nolan Ryan as far as being a smart businessman . " <p> Ryan is one of the top cattlemen in Texas . When informed of the comparison , Lee was humbled . <p> " Yeah , I 'd like to meet Ryan one day , " he said . <p> In the final stages of negotiations on his $100 million deal in November , McLane told Lee he wanted him to make some personal appearances . Lee agreed , on one condition - that he be allowed to skip two days of spring training to attend the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo . <p> " I think that in Houston Carlos has a lot of opportunities to expand his ranch in Panama , " said his wife , Mary de Lee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Houston is a great , great opportunity for him to expand his horizons . " <p> Comparisons to Carew <p> Lee , partly of Chinese descent , makes it clear that he wants to be the best at whatever he does - whether it 's baseball , cattle breeding , quarter-horse breeding or calf roping . <p> His father says the slugger wants to be remembered as Panama 's best hitter , a distinction that currently belongs to Hall of Famer Rod Carew , who was born on a train in the city of Gatun , in what was then known as the Panama Canal Zone . <p> " If I tell you my son is the best hitter Panama has produced , well ... , " says the eldest Lee , a provincial all-star third baseman and center fielder for 13 years who now plays on a provincial all-star softball team of seniors . " He 's starting to break some records . In some time , he 'll be the best . " <p> Carlos Noriel , the first son and second of three children born to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aguadulce 's Remon Candera Stadium where his father played . He took grounders at third base , the position he played on the provincial all-star team when he was scouted and signed by the Chicago White Sox in 1994 . <p> " I was excited when I took him to the diamond , " the eldest Lee said . " If he had a glove on , he was at ease . He showed interest right away . If you show interest and dedication , you 'll get where you want . " <p> Lee learned more than just baseball from his father . Being a provincial all-star in Panama garnered acclaim from neighbors and fans in this vibrant town of about 8,500 . <p> The eldest Lee handled regional distinction with class . Baseball was a mere hobby , though . He paid the bills with a career as a manager in a communications company while his wife taught at the local school . <p> " He taught me the lessons that I 'll teach my son , " Carlos Noriel says . " He taught me that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my son to learn to work and know that you have to work because nothing is given to you . You must earn everything . " <p> Calf roping off-limits <p> Baseball and breeding Brahmans may be highest on Lee 's list of activities , but they 're not the only things he does . <p> He has about 14,000 cattle , about 10,000 of them heifers or cows , and 15,000 acres total for his nine ranches . He owns eight 18-wheelers for his beer-distribution center . <p> He breeds quarter horses at Hacienda Lee , where all of the studs were imported from the U.S. Until recently , he was a competitive calf-roper . <p> Calf roping was deemed too risky for a man with a $100 million price on the power derived from his sturdy , 6-foot-2 frame . <p> " He fell off his horse and was almost hurt , " the eldest Lee said . " I told him not to rope anymore . I told him his time for that was later . I told him his time now is for baseball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will settle for sponsoring a calf-roping team . <p> As it is , Lee 's off-season schedule is full . He usually awakens about 5:30 a.m. and heads to work out by 5:45 . <p> If Lee gets out of shape , it 's not likely to be because of sedentary ways . He is constantly on the move . <p> Humility first <p> Ask a waitress or cab driver in Panama City about Lee . Ask a ranch hand or a fan at a baseball game in Aguadulce . Nobody mentions Lee 's home runs first . Nor his $100 million . <p> The first trait his countrymen mention is humility , a quality that some say has caused him to surpass World Series ring collector Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees as the most beloved major-leaguer in their country . <p> Some Panamanians view Rivera with disdain for what they consider aloofness . <p> Conversely , Lee is seen as willing to stay in his country and work toward making it better and richer . At times , they even compare Lee favorably with boxing great Roberto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He keeps a gun in his truck in Panama , but he does n't travel with bodyguards . He does n't shy away from the public . He 's around his neighbors so much , they hardly bother him . <p> " There 's not much traffic , no fuss , " he says . " I 'm where I love to be - in my ranches with my cattle , my horses and my people . " <p> While watching a youth baseball game recently in his hometown , he is given his space . He is asked to sign only about a dozen baseballs during the five innings he attends . Several children stop by to say hello , and he obliges them with a smile or embrace while their parents shoot pictures of him with cell phones . <p> A few days later , he does n't let fatigue diminish his willingness to mingle at the Feria de San Sebastian , a provincial livestock show where he is presenting 12 Brahman that were born and bred at his ranch .

After they 're rewashed and fed , Lee finally gets to eat dinner with his crew as the festival starts picking up in the evening . <p> Traditional folk dancers set up at opposite sides of the fairgrounds and in the stage in front of the show ring .
