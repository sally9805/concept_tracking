Some of the sharpest criticism yet of the Bush Administration 's policy in Iraq came last week from a familiar adversary , Ted Kennedy . In an interview with the AP , the Massachusetts Senator called the war a " fraud " that was " made up in Texas " to give the President a political boost . Even more provocatively , Kennedy raised questions about where the money being spent on Iraq is actually going . He cited a Congressional Budget Office report showing that only $2.5 billion of the $4 billion being spent each month on the war can be accounted for , and said the rest of the money is being doled out to " political leaders in all parts of the world , bribing them to send troops " to Iraq . <P> Republicans were quick to pounce ; House majority leader Tom DeLay accused Democrats of venting more " hateful rhetoric at President Bush than they ever did at Saddam Hussein . " In fact , Kennedy 's remarks may have been a case of frustration with the war overtaking the facts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for how all the money being funneled into Iraq is being spent , it contains no reference to any unaccountable $1.5 billion . Nor is there any evidence that the funds are being used to lure foreign troops to Iraq . Asked on CNN whether he had proof to back up his $1.5 billion allegation , Kennedy hedged on the specifics and resorted to the broad brush . The U.S. , he said , will soon announce loans of $8.5 billion to Turkey  --  which , he said , amounts to a " bribe " ( though such financial aid is a traditional way of rewarding allies ) . Kennedy 's aides insist his broad point is valid : that Bush 's policy has compelled the U.S. to buy support from other countries , and Congress still has no clear picture of how money is being spent in Iraq .  --  D.W.
