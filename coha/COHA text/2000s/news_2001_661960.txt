He approaches the tired wooden shack , eyeing the grimy plastic windows and tarpaper roof held down by old tires . For a man who has come to share his wealth , there 's a curious greeting : a snarling Rottweiler . <p> The dog 's owner emerges , tugs at a thick metal leash . He shows Sal Dimiceli inside , where a single bare bulb glows in the living room like a flashlight in a cave . <p> Dimiceli knows the family 's story : The man juggles two jobs . His wife has Hodgkin 's disease . Their three young kids are good students - he has checked out their grades in school . <p> Clutching a legal pad , Dimiceli takes no notes but everywhere he looks , he sees squalor : Insulation hangs from the ceiling . A drum-like furnace whose rusty surface doubles as a stove bulges from a wall . Threadbare towels block out the sunlight . <p> " We 're going to get you out of here , " he promises the man , who does n't want his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this hovel . <p> " I tried my best , " the husky man mumbles apologetically , stuffing his meaty hands in the pockets of his faded leather jacket . " This house is raggedy . It 's a piece of garbage . I could use the help . " <p> As Dimiceli leaves , he hands the man an envelope stuffed with a few hundred dollars . <p> Then he drives off in his red Dodge Ram , kicking up a cloud of dust in the gravel as he heads out to help someone else with another envelope , another pledge , another plan to improve life here . <p> For once , this hard-luck community , Pembroke Township , has crossed paths with good fortune . <p> For the last decade or so , Dimiceli has poured a couple million dollars of his own money into a place he just came across by chance one day - and could not forget . <p> Dimiceli had n't even heard of this community when he took a shortcut while heading to a nearby town to buy his son a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so many broken windows . He was even more shocked to learn people were inside . <p> He felt compelled to return . And he did . The next day . The next week . The next year . He brought clothes , mattresses and food . He began visiting people 's homes . Then he began building them homes . <p> It may seem strange to others , but it makes perfect sense to Dimiceli to adopt a place he stumbled across : <p> He was once poor . He saw poor people . He decided to help . It 's that simple , he says . <p> " It definitely gives me a sense of peace , " he says . " A doctor operates on somebody to make them feel better . I 'm doing my part to get these people to live better . " <p> Pembroke Township is about 70 miles southwest of Chicago , but it has the feel of down-and-out parts of the rural South in the 1950s , with living conditions that , in some cases , are desperate , even shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity . Holes in the ground that serve as bathrooms . <p> Pembroke Township does n't even have a gas line - people cart bottled gas or use firewood to heat their homes . <p> " I do n't want to say it 's prejudice , but we 're predominantly black . It 's a rural area . Draw your own conclusion , " says David Leggett , mayor of Hopkins Park , who used a government grant to buy gas line equipment but does n't have money to install it . <p> This village , pop . 711 , is the largest incorporated area in a township where more than half the people - many of them very young or old - live in poverty and where unemployment last year was 24 percent . <p> But statistics do n't capture the frustration here , born of promises and plans that never materialized , years of little political clout and lots of neglect . <p> Pembroke Township does have one great new hope : It has been chosen as the site of an $80 million state women 's prison , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed community . <p> Dimiceli knows it will take the money and power of government to transform the area , but his religious faith keeps him coming back , doing what he can - always aware there are limits to his largesse . <p> " The things that I do change lives in a small way - a blanket , shoes , food , " he says . " In the long run , who 's going to be here for the children so they can have jobs , get a good education , fend for themselves ? " <p> He leaves those larger questions to others , tending to the matters of daily life . The winter coats some of the elderly wear to church , the boxes of Cheerios handed out in a food pantry , hundreds of books kids read at Smith school - all are courtesy of Dimiceli . <p> He also has donated thousands of toys , diapers and pairs of shoes , repaired 40 to 50 homes , built six new ones ( with more planned ) , and paid utility bills ; he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And every month he tools down the two-lane blacktops shaded by savannah oaks looking for people to help . A slender man in corduroys and sweater , beard and tight cap of black curly hair , Dimiceli looks more like a graduate student than a rags-to-riches , 50-year-old businessman . <p> One day he saw Tamar Banks , a 67-year-old widow sitting in the door of her dilapidated red trailer , eating sausage and spinach from a can . <p> " I just knew then that God had sent him , " she says . " I just knew . " <p> Her roof looked like it was about to blow away . She had no running water , electricity , bathroom or refrigerator . <p> " I did n't feel like I was in such a terrible way , " she says . " I always knew someone was out there in worse shape than me . " <p> Dimiceli offered her a new trailer , but she asked if her old one could be repaired instead . So he hired people to do that . <p> " Ooo-ooo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different now . I have electricity and plumbing and all that . " <p> But when a stranger rides into a small town with money and promises , there 's bound to be suspicion . <p> And there certainly was here . <p> One of the wary ones was Billy Mitchell , superintendent of Pembroke Community Consolidated School District 259 - where 98 percent of the students are eligible for free government lunches . <p> People " could n't imagine a well-to-do white boy would be doing something like this , " Mitchell confides , leaning over his cluttered desk . " They thought there was something in it for him . One dear friend of mine said , ' It does n't make sense . ' But he 's convinced now . " <p> Dimiceli 's steady presence has assuaged some fears . And he has recruited pastors , township officials and others to be his eyes and ears - and make sure his money is well-spent . <p> Some critics quietly say he is making people dependent . <p> But Jon Dyson , pastor of the Church of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and he believes Dimiceli wants to inspire others to help . <p> " He 's saying , ' Can you believe people live like this in the United States ? " ' Dyson explains . " He 's trying to call attention to this place . " <p> In the billion-dollar world of philanthropy , Sal Dimiceli 's generosity is barely a footnote - about $2 million . But in a township whose annual budget is about $225,000 , his open wallet makes a big difference . <p> It has changed his life , too . <p> He is now phasing out his business - he owns a company that is a manufacturer 's representative of computer cabinet and circuit board makers - to devote full-time to charity work . He says he ca n't continue the pace of donating half his salary . <p> Dennis Hannon , his lawyer , agrees . <p> " I told him you 're going to have to start watching the amount you 're giving away or you 're going to end up in one of those houses you built , " Hannon says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he takes on more than he should . <p> " But if Sal sees somebody in need , he 's going to go out and buy them shoes , " she adds . " He 's not going to try to find a job for the man . That 's what he sees as the immediate need . He does what his heart tells him to do . " <p> For Dimiceli , seeing poor people evokes personal memories . <p> His father , now dead , gambled away his earnings , moving his family from city to city , sometimes abandoning them in shame , then returning months later . <p> Dimiceli remembers days when the electricity was turned off , when the eviction notice came , when relatives had to bring over food . <p> " I definitely am reliving my childhood , " he says . " I spent too many days wishing I had another shirt , a different pair of shoes where there was n't a hole in the cardboard . " <p> By age 12 , Dimiceli had a job as a dishwasher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help support his family . He never finished college and though he now has all of life 's comforts , he never forgets his past . <p> " I have an outstanding drive that comes from ... not wanting to return to poverty , " he says . <p> And a determination to pull others out . <p> Take 91-year-old Eugene Thomas . <p> He and his wife , Hazel , were paying $65-a-month rent for a cinder block house with rooms as small as prison cells , filled with furniture most people would discard . Cabinets were chopped up for firewood . <p> Dimiceli promised to build them a home . <p> " I said , ' You must be joking , " ' says Thomas , his smile widening as he recounts that day as vividly as he remembers being an orphan begging for food . <p> A few years ago , Thomas moved into a three-bedroom furnished house . <p> " He 's a man of his word , " Thomas says . " He 's a man with a good heart . " <p> Sitting in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses : wooden cabinets , shiny tile floor , new appliances . <p> " I 'm comfortable , " he says in a booming voice . " I 'm clean . And I 'm happy . " <p> On a spring day , Thomas , his arm tucked under Dimiceli 's elbow , strolls across a weed-filled field to his former house . <p> The two men bend to peer inside as if it were a dollhouse , the floral curtains still fluttering in the wind . <p> They walk back , a journey of just a few hundred yards . <p> " I 've come a long way , " Thomas says . " I sure have . " <p> Dimiceli leaves , driving down a short stretch of road called Trinity Lane . <p> The name of the road was his doing . <p> So was the road . <p> And all six houses on it . <p> EDITOR 's NOTE - Sharon Cohen is the AP 's Midwest regional reporter , based in Chicago . <p> On the Net : **34;5941;TOOLONG <p> End Adv for Sunday , June @ @
