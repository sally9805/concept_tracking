<p> Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 's spokesman flies to Kosovo on Sunday to press ethnic Albanian leaders to halt the spread of violence in the disputed province . <p> The unusual mission for James P. Rubin takes advantage of ties he developed last year to leading politicians of the former Kosovo Liberation Army , the militant group that battled forces loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . <p> Before leaving for the southern province of Serbia , Rubin said he would " express our profound concern about extremist activity on all sides " in Kosovo . He plans to meet ethnic Albanian officials as well as U.S. and NATO officials in Pristina , the provincial capital . <p> Rubin travels to a province experiencing a surge in tensions in the ethnically divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica , one of the few communities in which a significant Serb population still remains . Recent attempts by NATO to repatriate ethnic Albanian refugees to the largely Serb northern part of the city have prompted riots . <p> NATO peacekeepers have also expressed alarm about a recent surge of violence just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new group of ethnic Albanian militants has emerged to fight what they describe as harassment by Serb police forces . <p> On Friday , NATO 's top general in Kosovo , German Gen. Klaus Reinhardt , bluntly dismissed any suggestion that the alliance 's peacekeepers would step in to support the militants . Instead , he promised that Kosovo 's borders would be further fortified to prevent the export of weapons or fighters to help ethnic kin just over the boundary line . <p> Rubin would be the likely messenger to underline that hands-off message , using his cache of being backed by his close ties to Albright . <p> Rubin is also on friendly terms with Hashim Thaci , the former political leader of Kosovo 's rebels . Rubin began cultivating those ties during the failed peace talks in Rambouillet , France last year that served as a prelude to NATO 's 78-day bombing campaign . <p> The trip is likely to be the last major assignment for the State Department spokesman , whose televised press conferences made him well-known during the air war against Yugoslavia . Rubin plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in the province , Rubin is also scheduled to visit a family in the western Kosovo city of Djakovica that has six male family members who are still missing , months after the end of the war . <p> Kosovo 's Albanians say there will never be peace in the disputed province without a full accounting of the missing and those held in prisons in Serbia proper . <p> It is widely believed here that Milosevic 's government rounded up many ethnic Albanian civilians during the final days of the air campaign and transported them out of the province to be used as bargaining chips in any future negotiations on Kosovo 's future .
