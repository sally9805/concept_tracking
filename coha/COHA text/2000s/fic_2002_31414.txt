Captain Kirk was suspended in the gateway , floating between the countless dimensions . The interstellar transport lasted for only a few seconds , but the flashing light seemed to freeze every thought and feeling he had . Then he was falling out the other side , rolling to his feet and unsteady on the soft surface . He was standing on the edge of a small platform , suspended near the top of a giant crevice . The sheer parallel cliffs extended for miles to either side . Holding his arms out for balance , Kirk could only look down . The cliffs descended out of sight . The bottom was obscured by mist or smoke that was rising , softening the sharp edges of the cliffs . The rocks on both sides looked as if huge sections often sheared off and fell forever into the center of the planet . Backing away from the edge , Kirk looked around and saw the two Kalandans . " Tasm ! Stop ! " Commander Tasm was on the other side of the platform , trying to wrest away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blue neutronium cylinder was the key component of the gateway , and they were waving it around between them at the edge of an abyss ! Kirk briefly considered stunning them , but they were too close to the edge and he was afraid they would be knocked over by the impact . So he ran forward and grabbed Tasm around the waist , pulling her away . Luz hung on to the cylinder and came with her . The soft ground gave Kirk plenty of traction , and he was able to drag both women closer to the wall of the cliff . There was an arched doorway there leading to a tunnel . Apparently that was the way off the platform . Tasm struggled against him , but Kirk took hold of the cylinder with one hand , expertly twisting it away from her . The Kalandans were thin and frail even if they were tall . But Luz hung on , kicking at him and jerking on the cylinder as if she were crazed . It swung wide and hit Tasm in the head , driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commander rocked crouching on her knees , her head in her hands . Glaring at him , Luz managed to push Kirk closer to the sheer drop . The streaks of green and blue on her eyelids suddenly looked right . He had n't seen such a display of outright passion from any of the Kalandans . " It 's mine ! " Luz screamed . " Let go ! " Kirk stayed calm . " Stop fighting me or we 're both going over . " In response , she swiped a leg at him , catching him behind the knee . Kirk stumbled , and her momentum carried her forward , taking him right to the edge of the platform . Kirk was n't letting go of the cylinder . He meant it  --  if he went over , then he was taking her with him . Their brief struggle showed that she did n't know anything about hand-to-hand combat . But she fought in a frenzy , nearly knocking him off the platform . Kirk got his feet under him and spun away from her , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , he grabbed hold of her wrist . She tried to wrench it away from him , but he twisted her arm down , forcing her to take one hand off the cylinder . With a quick turn , he stepped behind her , bringing her arm behind her back . Now that he had leverage on her , he had the advantage . She did n't have enough brute power to shake him off . He jerked the cylinder from her grasp and bent her arm up until she went to her knees . Her cry did n't stop him . He hung on to her long enough to make her realize there was no way she could win in a fight . " Had enough ? " Panting , she continued to struggle to get away from him . But she knew she could n't beat him . Finally Kirk let go , pushing her away to roll on the ground next to Tasm . Tasm was still on her knees , groaning from her head injury . Her eyes were bleary as she tried to focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained it on them both so they did n't get any more ideas . Then he quickly assessed his situation . They were standing on a platform hardly six meters square . But what he had mistaken for soft sand was really some kind of plush rubbery material that coated the rock . He took a few steps inside the tunnel , getting a better look at the thick beige stuff . It ran up the sides , covering it completely . Farther in , the tunnel ended . When he poked at the stuff , it felt like a dense block of suede . Back outside , Kirk looked in both directions up and down the crevice . He had seen two metal-plated buildings on top of the cliffs before jumping through the gateway . Now he had to strain to see them . They were much farther up on the opposite side . The sun in the orange sky was so bright it made it hard to focus on the dull metal . One look at the cliff behind him , and he knew it could n't have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could make it with hands and feet alone , with the gateway cylinder strapped to his back by his uniform jacket . But that was his last resort . Still holding the phaser on the two women , Kirk demanded , " Where are we ? " Tasm was moaning and clutching her head , so he jerked his phaser at Luz . " You brought us here . What is this place ? " Luz 's lips drew back from her teeth , a desperate expression . " This is our birthing world . " " You are n't Kalandans . " " We 're Petraw ! " she spit at him . " You 're such fools ! Such trusting fools ... " Tasm was struggling to stand up . " Silence , Luz ! You 've betrayed your pod  --  " " I saved the interstellar transporter ! " Luz let out a high-pitched shriek , rushing at Tasm . With surprise on her side , Luz managed to shove Tasm toward the edge . Tasm fell flat to stop herself from going over . Luz sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screaming inarticulately . " You never learn , do you ? " Kirk dropped the cylinder to go to Tasm 's defense , but he was n't exactly willing to risk his own life for her . Aiming his phaser , he hesitated as they rolled over , Tasm on top , then on the bottom again . Before he could fire , he was surrounded by people . Hands grabbed his arms and took away his phaser . They were rough , their manner abrupt . It was like they appeared out of nowhere . Kirk stopped struggling immediately . When they realized he was giving them no trouble , they let his arms free so he could stand among them . He could n't see what had happened to his phaser , but it was gone . They separated Tasm and Luz , taking them to opposite sides of the platform . Kirk counted eight humanoids crowded onto the platform , dressed alike in whitish-transparent bags complete with enclosed hands and feet . The loose hoods over their heads slid forward . Kirk settled his uniform , reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people picked it up first . Kirk had to look up to see his face . It was like melted wax , with his nose , eyes , and chin softened and flattened . " I 'm James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise . " Kirk pointed to the cylinder , holding out his hand . " I believe that belongs to me . " Luz cried out , stumbling forward . Kirk could n't understand what she was saying , something about completing an engagement ... Tasm was speaking to others , still holding one hand to her injured head . Clearly these were her people . The androgynous Petraw held up the cylinder . " This is for the matriarchs to deal with . " " Are those your superiors ? " Kirk asked . Getting an affirmative in response , he agreed , " Lead the way . " He was more than ready to talk to someone in charge . Tasm had clearly lied to him about everything . Tasm and Luz were herded into the tunnel behind him . It had somehow become unclogged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he could only see a short way , and the top was within reach of his hand . It was cramped , but better than climbing that towering cliff freehand . Kirk could hardly see a thing . There was no obvious light source , but the pliable material covering the walls was so pale it seemed to glow like amber under a light . It was n't long before the tunnel ended in a slightly more bulbous section . Straight ahead were six hexagonal openings stacked three across and two high . Each opening was about a meter wide . " In there . " The Petraw holding the cylinder gestured to the first hexagonal opening on the bottom . Kirk peered in , but he could n't see out the other side . " This is the way to the matriarchs ? " Several of the Petraw crowded close to him , trying to push him inside . Their baggy coveralls rustled as he resisted . " What 's the rush ? " Kirk tried to regain his footing on the mushy floor . They still nudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized he was being given no choice and he began to fight back . Without hesitation , the Petraw seized his legs and arms , subduing him by sheer numbers . Before he knew it , they were tossing him into the hexagon . They slapped something on the end . Kirk scrabbled at it with his fingers . The covering was hard and peach-colored , almost opaque . He could see the shadows of the Petraw outside , but even when he kicked hard against it with both feet , he could n't budge the seal on the end . After a while Kirk could n't see any more shadows . It was pitch dark inside . He kept kicking against the plug , but it held firm . He crawled to the other end , checking it for openings , but it was sealed tight as well . He was trapped . It did n't take long to search the place . Kirk could sit up inside the cell if he hunched over , his hair brushing the ceiling . He could also lie down and stretch out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outstretched arms . It was a tiny , claustrophobic place . A sarcophagus buried in the rock . He was n't sure where the fresh air was coming from . Feeling around , he found nothing but smooth , slightly damp walls that were cool to the touch . Too bad his phaser was gone . But they had n't taken his communicator . Operating the communicator by touch , Kirk checked each frequency , listening for activity . There might be a Starfleet vessel in the area , or an allied planet that had diplomatic ties to the Federation . " This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise . Can anyone read me ? I 'm being held prisoner .... " He repeated his distress call on every frequency . If the Petraw did n't like it , they could come stop him . But there was no response . The static was extremely high , crackling on the lower frequencies , leading him to believe that a shield could be interfering with the subspace channel . Kirk grimly kept trying . His voice was raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one could hear his calls . A different course of action was required . Kirk flipped the cover up and felt the screen mesh . No sharp edges on it or on the smooth black body of the unit . He tried wrenching the cover from the communicator , straining with both hands to twist it out of its hinge . The mesh cracked at one corner , breaking free and leaving a jagged edge . He winced when it cut his probing finger . The other corner slid out of the hinge . Kirk dug the broken cover into the seal on the end of the cell . It reacted like some kind of polymer . The jagged edge left a small slice in the flexible stuff . He hacked away at the seal . The polymer would n't tear , but successive jabs cut deeper into it . Satisfied that he was finally making some progress , he worked faster . It took a while for Kirk to break through . At first only one hand could push out of the cell . He continued to dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders through was the hardest . He struggled with the polymer as if the cell were alive and determined to keep him inside . When he finally slid through , dragging his legs after him , he rolled onto the soft ground . Only to find himself trapped again . The tunnel was exactly the same as before , nearly dark with no way to get out . But the Petraw were gone . Kirk carefully retraced their steps , and found the tunnel once more clogged at the end with a dense mass of tan polymer . But now he knew that it could be opened . He plunged his hands into the center , feeling them sink deeper and deeper . It was powdery dry . The stretchy texture reminded him of the thick rubber bands he had used as a kid for makeshift slingshots . He pushed harder on it . The walls slowly started drawing back , opening up to reveal the platform where the gateway had deposited him . It was darker outside now , and Kirk went forward to see the blood orange sky looming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright white stars . Everything inside the crevice was ruddy , including the cliffs and the tunnel . The Petraw could have taken a transport from the platform up to those metallic structures . But why did Luz bring them here instead of directly to the top ? The last thing she had expected was for Kirk and Tasm to come along with her . Kirk crouched down and went right to the edge of the platform to look over again . The crack seemed to descend forever , cleft deep into the planet . It was completely dark down there , and would likely be even in the brightest daylight . Plus there was that odd smoky mist . It did n't look very inviting . No , the answer must lay inside the tunnel . Kirk went back inside , returning to the six hexagon cells . He did n't have much time before the tunnel began to close behind him , shutting out most of the light . But he searched the walls quickly , pushing and poking , trying to find another place where the polymer would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands sank into the wall . Kirk leaned in , pushing his arms into the center . The barrier began to give way , irising into an opening tall enough for him to step through . It was not much brighter inside this tunnel , with the ambient light coming from a warm glow within the walls themselves . The tunnel finally widened as it ended in a cross-tunnel . This passageway was apparently well trodden , with the tan polymer floor roughened and pitted by use . Going down this tunnel , Kirk paused to listen to the echo of odd mechanical noises . Light slanted out of a doorway ahead . Edging closer , he could see a brightly lit , cavernous space filled with various large pieces of equipment . They were interconnected by ductwork and conduit junctions . The walls and floor were bare rock rather than being covered by the beige polymer . A shadow crossed the doorway as several Petraw approached the door from inside . Kirk pulled back , pressing against the wall . He sank in deeper and deeper until it almost covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wondered if he could bury himself completely . But there was still a stripe down his front that was n't covered . But the Petraw passed by in the gloom without noticing him . Kirk finally managed to pull away from the wall , which took as much effort as sinking into it . Then he looked around the doorway again . The machinery appeared to be pumps and some kind of a hydraulic press . They were being operated by Petraw in the baggy coveralls . Kirk waited until none of the Petraw were in view before vaulting across the opening . He was n't ready to take on a dozen Petraw by himself . Not yet . He felt very conspicuous in his gold and black uniform . If anyone came down the tunnel , he would be spotted instantly . But he continued on . Far ahead , light was slanting out another door , and beyond that was another door . Kirk made the same careful approach . Each large chamber held different types of machinery . In every one , the rock was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His luck changed when he found the factory where the coveralls were made . Inside the door were racks of drying coveralls , shining and smelling strongly like a brand-new spacesuit . They were translucent when wet , drying to nearly a solid white . Kirk slipped in among the racks , going deeper to avoid the Petraw who were conveying the garments out of a mold and hanging them up to dry . Some of them were miniature , probably for babies , while others were bigger than he was . They were designed exactly the same ; bags with legs that started at the knees and arms that started at the elbows , ending in booties and four-fingered gloves . The hood was attached to the neck . He found one his size , but he was n't sure how to get inside it . After some experimental testing , he realized the neck stretched if it was steadily pulled on . By the time his shoulders got through , it was hanging open wide . But when he pulled up the hood , the elasticized stuff began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . With the hood up , Kirk felt much better . His black pants could vaguely be seen through the near-opaque polymer . But in the darkness , no one would notice . Finally feeling free to roam , Kirk slipped out of the garment factory and began briskly walking down the center of the tunnel . He did n't have to sneak up to every doorway , and could take more time to examine the unusual machinery . It had the same hodgepodge construction as Tasm 's ship , as if different materials and technology had been jumbled together to form one functioning unit . No one paid any attention to him , even when several Petraw passed close by . They kept their eyes cast down as they walked , and their movements seemed somewhat slow to Kirk . He grew bolder , ranging through the corridors . His general direction was up , figuring that would be the way to get out of the complex . Yet the tunnels went on and on , making him pause as he tried to remember his route . No sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out in concentric rings , with short , steeply sloping tunnels up to the next level . Though it had long underground corridors like the Kalandan station , everything else was different . The Kalandan passageways were large and kept sparkling clean like the space station it was . This place was cramped , dark , and dirty , like an underground mine . The Petraw , especially the smaller ones , were bowed down with work . With their melted faces , he could n't tell any of them apart . Kirk did n't want to feel sorry for Tasm , but for some reason he did . It took hours before Kirk found what he was looking for  --  a docking bay for spaceships . Keeping his elation in check , he passed a few of the larger vessels the size of Tasm 's ship . They filled the underground bunkers from one end to the other . Then he came across several hangars for the smaller shuttlecraft-type ships , the kind that a single man could operate . Kirk was grinning in relief . That had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was get hold of the interstellar transporter and steal a ship to return to the Enterprise . It took a while to explore the extensive hangars to find the right ship . Most were being worked on round the clock by the silent waxwork Petraw . At this point , he did n't hesitate to go right up to them . They were so intent on their jobs that as long as he appeared to be doing a task of his own no one paid attention to him . They coordinated with each other with a minimum of clipped words , almost a technocode . The one time Kirk was asked a question , he made sure his hood hung over his face before grunting and shaking his head . The worker accepted his ignorance and asked someone else . Finally Kirk found a small ship that appeared fully operational . He slid into the pilot 's seat and examined the controls . The panel was activated , but it was like nothing he had ever seen . Spiky symbols scrolled down one side , with triangles and diamond patterns on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe not so simple ... " His other problem was how to get the ship out of the hangar . There were large recessed doors in the ceiling of each bunker , but he could n't see a control panel that operated them . I might need a native guide , he thought . Not that Luz or Tasm seemed predisposed to help him . Working at the panel , Kirk managed to call up the navigational chart . The pattern of a galactic star map was clear in any language . He felt a rising hope that he would manage in spite of any obstacle  - -  Then he realized what he was seeing . Amid the multitude of stars , there was one that coincided with a red stationary indicator . It was near the center of the galaxy , in the spiral arm at the base of the Beta Quadrant . Kirk froze . In the center of the galaxy ... if that red indicator meant what he thought it meant , then he was there ! At least forty thousand light-years away from Federation territory ... Dazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warp speed of 9.9  --  and no ship could go that fast for very long  --  it would take him over twenty years to get back to the Enterprise .
