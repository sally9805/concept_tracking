<p> Q : What is the best way to prepare paper for a silverpoint drawing ? <p> A : Apply a thin layer of Chinese white , hard gesso , or tinted gouache with a soft broad brush ( a sable or camel hair will do ) to a sheet of 100% rag-content smooth watercolor or drawing paper . Many fine-art supply stores carry coated papers for silverpoint , but it is simple to make your own . <p> Silverpoint was actually the precursor to graphite-pencil drawing . Besides silver , gold also produces the extremely delicate marks that distinguish silverpoint drawings . The line is gray when the mark is first made by the meal tip as it is drawn across the pigment-coated surface , but it gradually oxidizes , tarnishing like silver to a brownish-black color . Gold makes a yellow-brown line at first , which also turns a brownish black . If you can not purchase a metal point made for silverpoint drawing , you can substitute a piece of silver wire or a nail . The tip should be fine but not very sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper , use an emery board or fine sandpaper to smooth away any roughness or a too-sharp point . A silver-point tip does not wear down with use the way a piece of graphite does . <p> Q : As a woodworker ( and oil painter ) , I have lots of scrap sheets of plywood , especially ? - thick pieces , of both indoor and outdoor grades . What are the pros and cons of using plywood as a support instead of linen or canvas ? <p> A : Because the character of the support has an immediate effect on the painting process , the needs and preferences of the individual artist determine whether a rigid support like plywood or a flexible support like linen or cotton duck is best . Assuming proper preparation and good quality , the only drawback to plywood is its weight , especially when used for large-scale paintings . As with any panel support , a plywood support larger than 24 inches requires bracing to keep it from warping and is considerably heavier than its canvas counterpart . <p> Plywood is composed of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composites and veneers glued together , with each layer pressing at right angles against the grain of the next layer . This arrangement of layers helps reduce warping . The number of layers , three being the minimum , determines the thickness of the plywood , from ? to 1 ? . Cut plywood with a circular saw or a band saw , as their teeth go in one direction . A handsaw , by contrast , cuts both ways , which may loosen the outer layers and tear the edges . Also , with a softwood veneer surface like pine , the grain may eventually show through the paint layers . ( The hardwood veneers , such as maple , birch , walnut , and mahogany , are less likely to do so . ) The pine veneer , which is the least expensive , is fine to use if it has one smooth side without knots , seams , fillers , and plugs . Birch plywood , usually the most commercially available in lumber-supply stores , provides a good support for painting . <p> The quality of plywood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glue the various layers of wood , increasing the likelihood that the layers may separate over time . Glue type is also one of the main differences between indoor and outdoor plywood . Outdoor-grade plywood , which must be resistant to moisture , requires very strong glue . Indoor plywood uses less adhesive and has smooth surface finishes on both sides . <p> Q : I will be shipping 10 large oils , with an average size of 38 ? x 72 ? , to London for an exhibition . I plan to roll them , face out , in one batch in a PVC tube , transporting the tube as luggage on the plane . They will have had their two coats of damar varnish for at least three weeks , some for eight weeks . How can I keep them from sticking together en route ? <p> A : Although the surface of the paintings may have had enough time to dry , it is a good idea to line them with pieces of glassine , the least sticky of papers . Rolls of glassine are available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paintings face out . The painted surface is compressed when the painted side is rolled inward . Also , when rolled inward , there is additional strain when they are unrolled . Use a PVC tube with the greatest diameter available . <p> Q : What are the advantages and disadvantages of oil paint sticks ? <p> A : Oil paint sticks can be layered to a considerable thickness and easily manipulated on any surface prepared for oil paints . They can be scraped just like an oil painting , and they can be used in conjunction with tube oil paints . The appeal of oil sticks is that they combine the immediacy of drawing with the advantages of painting . They can be used for the early stages of a painting or as an end in themselves . They can be applied on top of painted layers to add linear elements to a painting . They are capable of giving fluid , uninterrupted marks  --  there is no need to stop and reload the brush . Oil sticks , augmented by a few brushes and some turpentine , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantage of oil paint sticks is the inconsistency among products ; an artist must test the colors and drying times before use . However , most high-quality paint sticks are consistent and compatible . <p> Under the umbrella term oil paint sticks are oil crayons and oil pastels . The difference between these two products is in the oil and wax content of each . Oil sticks are made with a drying oil , which allows a hard paint film to form , and just enough wax content to achieve their crayonlike consistency . Oil pastels , on the other hand , contain more wax and a nondrying oil . They do not dry completely and therefore do not form a paint film . <p> We welcome technical questions relating to painting , drawing , printmaking , sculpture , and other media , but we are unable to answer them by mail .
