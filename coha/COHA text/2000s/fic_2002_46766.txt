Had I been dreaming , I would have dreamt of being someone else , with a little creature burrowed in my body , clawing at the walls inside my chest-a recurring nightmare . But I was awake , listening to the mizzle in my pillow , to the furniture furtively sagging , to the house creaking under the wind assaults . I straightened my legs , so the blanket ebbed and my right foot rose out of the sludge of darkness like a squat , extinguished lighthouse . The blinds gibbered for a moment , commenting on my performance , then settled in silence . <p> I closed the bathroom door , and the hooked towels trembled . There was the pungent smell of the plastic shower curtain and disintegrating soap . The toilet bowl was agape , with a dissolving piece of toilet paper in it throbbing like a jellyfish . The faucet was sternly counting off droplets . I took off my underwear and let it lie in a pile , then stepped behind the curtain and let the water run . Wee rainbows locked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fantasized about melting under the shower and disappearing into the drain . <p> Down the stairs I went , carrying a mound of dirty laundry , careful not to trip over the inquisitive cat . I put the laundry on top of the washing machine , which shuddered as though delighted , and pulled the rope pending in the darkness-cobwebs sprung into the air around the bulb . I had to wait for the spin to throttle to a stop before I could put my laundry in the machine , so I followed the cat into the other room . There were boxes full of things that must have been left by the tenants-who might they have been ? - who used to live in one of the apartments : wallpaper scrolls , a broken-boned umbrella , a soulless football , a bundle of shoes with crescent soles , a pictureless frame , skeins of anonymous dust . Back in the laundry room , I transferred the sodden clothes of the upstairs people to the dryer , then loaded the washing machine . In the other room , the cat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not see . <p> Today was the interview day . I had called-years ago , it seemed now-and set up an interview for an ESL teaching job , strictly out of despair . I had been laid off from the Art Institute bookstore once the merry Christmas season , including the mad aftermath of the Big Sale , was over . My job there had been to unpack boxes of books , shelve the books , and then smash the boxes and throw them away . Smashing the boxes was my favorite part , the controlled , benign destruction . <p> Two white eggs roiled in the boiling water , like irisless eyes . The floor was sticky , so I had to unpeel my bare soles from the floor with every step-I thought of the movies in which people walk on the ceiling , upside down . A cockroach was scuttling across the cutting board , trying to reach the safety behind the stove . I imagined the greasy warmth , the vales of dirt , the wires winding like roads . I imagined getting there , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half by something immense coming down on me . <p> I had tried other bookstores , but they did n't want me . I had tried getting a job as a waiter , elaborately lying about my previous waiting experience in the best Sarajevo restaurants , high-European-class all , and nonexistent on top of that . I had spent my measly savings and was in the furniture-selling phase . I sold , for the total of $74 , a decaying futon with a rich cat-barf pattern ; a hobbly table with four chairs , inexplicably scarred , as if they had walked through fields of barbed wire . I was late with my rent , and had already looked up the word " eviction " in the dictionary , hoping that the secondary , obsolete meaning ( " the action of conquering a country or of obtaining something by conquest " ) would override my landlord 's primary meaning and save my ass . <p> I stepped out the door onto the porch , where the green plastic chairs convened around nothing ; the swing still quaked under invisible weight ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fly buzzed against the windowpane , as though trying to cut through it with a minikin saw . In the house across the street , a bare-chested man , skinny like a camp inmate-his shoulder bones protruding , his trunk striped with rib shadows-was coming in and out of his house feverishly , only to disappear in it in the end . I was about to lock the door when I saw the cat gnawing on a mouse Is head , patiently exposing its crimson essence . <p> And it was n't just the money . When I could n't smash the boxes , I had obsessively read the papers and watched TV ( until I sold it ) to see what was happening back home . What was happening was death . I had looked up that word , too : " the act or fact of dying ; the end of life ; the final and irreversible cessation of the vital function of a plant or an animal . " <p> The air outside was oily and warm , and I stood on the street distending my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked the beginning of the marble season : the ground would soon be soft , and you did n't have to wear gloves ; you could keep your hands in your pockets-waiting for your turn , revolving marbles with the tips of your fingers-until a red line appeared across your palm , marking the border between the part of your palm that was inside and the part that was outside . You would kneel and indent the soil with your knees , imprinting smudges on your trousers , progressing toward an inexorable punishment from your parents . Today I had a couple of marbles in my pockets , plus an El transfer card , creased and fragile . <p> A woman with spring freckles , towed by a giant Akita , smiled at me for no apparent reason , and I stepped off the sidewalk-confused by the smile , scared by the Akita-onto the ground . I let the woman pass , and then walked as if walking through deep water , because I did n't want her to think that I was following her . The Akita was sniffing everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me again . The sun was at my back , so she squinted , wrinkling the ridge of her nose . She seemed to be on the verge of saying something , but the Akita pulled her away , almost ripping her arm off . I was relieved . I preferred being a vague , pleasant memory to having to explain who I was or telling her that I had no job , and when I had one , it was smashing boxes . <p> A teenager in a window-throbbing car drove by , pointing his finger at me , shooting . I crossed the street to look at a sheet of paper pinned to a tree in front of a building exuding dampness . The sign read in red letters : <p> LOST DOG <p> I lost masculine dog , this COCTAIL SPANIEL and his name LUCKY BOY He has long , long ears and curve hair gold brown color with short tail also he is very friendly , little crazy .

Drowsy people entered the station , sneering at the noise . The man smiled at me , showing dark gaps between his teeth . When I was a boy , spitting between your teeth was considered a great skill , because you could achieve precision , like those snakes in Survival spurting poison at terrified field mice , but my teeth were too close together , and I could never do it-after every attempt there would be spit dripping off my chin . <p> The station smelled of urine and petroleum . A dreadlocked woman in a yellow vest was rummaging through a closet with metal doors under the stairs , then took out a shovel and looked at it with surprise-she seemed to have expected something else . I ascended with the escalator onto the platform , and waited there to see the train lights . The wind was rolling an empty can toward the edge-the can would stop , trying to resist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the edge . A mouse scurried between the rails . I expected it to be electrocuted on the third rail : a few sparks , a shrill squeal , a stiff , dun mouse , still astonished by the suddenness of the end . <p> On the train , a young black man with his hands folded over his crotch said , " All we ask for is to give your life to Jesus Christ and follow him to the Kingdom of God . " His companion , wide-shouldered , bearded , walked through the train car offering everyone a brown bag of peanuts and salvation . An old lady with a plastic wrap on her bloated gray hair took some and grinned abruptly , as if a shot of pain went through her body at that very instant . A wizened old man , wearing a grimace of perplexed horror and a sallow straw fedora , looked up at the peanut man . A young woman in front of me-a pointed tongue of hair touched her collar , and she smelled like cinnamon and milk-was reading the paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had been in Gorazde only once , only because I had vomited in the car , on our way somewhere , and my parents stopped in Gorazde to clean up the mess . All I remembered was being thirsty and shivering on the front seat , as my father wiped the back seat with a cloth ; and then my father leaving my cloth-wrapped vomit by the road , and hungry , desperate little animals crawling out of the bushes to devour it . The woman gave a neatly creased dollar to the peanut man , took a bag from him , ripped it open , and started crunching the nuts . I said : " No , thank you . Granville , Loyola , Morse . The woman flipped the page , a few nut shells pitter-pattered . " Sunny Skies Warm Most of Nation . " We disembarked the train at Howard , leaving behind the floor littered with peanut shells , and a drunk in a Cubs hat , slumped in the dark corner . <p> There was something exhilarating and unsettling about going in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the escalator and then all descended ; we went through sundry revolving bars , which patted us on the back , as if we had just come back from a dangerous mission . In the urine-scented shade of the station , buses were lined up in perfect perspective , sucking in passengers through the front doors . A weather-beaten sign on a Coke machine read " No Working " ; a torn poster on the wall pictured an erect elephant trunk holding a wand with a bright star on its tip , announcing the yesteryear arrival of a circus . I had never taught anything in my life , let alone English , but despair was my loyal ally . <p> I put my hands in my jacket pockets : a couple of marbles , a taper of lint , a coin , a transfer . I remember this trivial handful because I can recall looking at an old black lady : a peppered coat , a bell hat ; her knuckles coiled around a cane handle , leaning slightly forward . To be able to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not such a bad thing ; your pockets are your hands ' home . <p> There was a bench nobody was sitting on , encrusted with blotches . I looked up : on a steel beam high up above perched a jury of pigeons , cooing peevishly . They bloated and deflated , blinking down on us , effortlessly releasing feces . When I was a kid , I thought that snow came from God shitting on us . The Touhy bus arrived , and we lined up at the bus door . I experienced an intense sneeze of happiness , simply because I managed not to lose my transfer . <p> The bus smelled of an unknown disinfecting potion , a trace of sausagey sweat , and nondescript dust dryness . The jury of pigeons fluttered up as the bus moved forward , pressing us against our seats , until we all dutifully jerked forward . I used to have a friend-he was killed by an accelerating piece of shrapnel-who liked to think that there was a quiet part of the universe where a body could have a steady velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , never stopping or entering a gravitational field . This bus , for instance , would have moved slowly , pleasantly , down Touhy , not stopping at the lights , on to Lincolnwood , Park Ridge , Elk Grove Village , Schaumburg , Hanover Park , and onward through Iowa and whatever there was beyond Iowa , all the way to California , and then over the Pacific , gliding across the endless water until we reached Shanghai-we would 've all got to know one another on this ship , we would 've gone all the way together . <p> The bus stopped abruptly at Western , the driver honking violently , then glancing at us in the rearview mirror . A man crossed the street in front of the bus , carrying a rolled-up carpet , which was breaking on his shoulder , its ends touching the ground . The man was sagging under the burden , his neck bent , his knees stooping , as if he were carrying a weighty cross . <p> We moved on , passed Inner Light Hair Sanctuary , AutoZone PartsWorld , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gliding by Barnaby &; Scribner Family Dining , Mt . Sinai Medical Center , Eastern Style Pizza . I got off the bus across the street from a Chinese restaurant-New World , it was called , but it was empty , only a sign in the window saying " For Lease . " <p> I had a few more minutes before the interview , and I was not ready to go in and get a job ( how could I teach anyone anything ? ) , so I lingered in front of the photo shop next to New World . A sign in the window-thick black letters-read : <p> Old Photos Copied <p> Any Size <p> Color <p> Or <p> Black and White . <p> There was a photo of black-and-white miners , their eyes twinkling behind a mask of gray dust . They held their pickaxes solemnly , their helmets pressing down on their faces . In another photo , three kids in knickers and jackets with sleeves that could not reach their wrists stood a step away from one another , with the same tenebrous eyes , shorn hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a Before photo and an After photo : the Before photo showed a man with a long curly beard slowly swallowing his face and dark wrinkles above his murky eyes . He sat with his hands coiled in his lap . A younger man stood on his left , his right hand cautiously touching the old man 's shoulder . The upper right  --  hand corner of the photo was missing , including half of the young man 's yarmulke . Both men were cut by a jagged white line ( the old man across his chest , the young man across his waist ) , with a trail of white blots spreading towards the old man 's beard-a crease and its offspring , created in somebody 's pocket . The After photo had no blots , no crease , and the yarmulke was restored . The men 's faces were whiter , and the young man 's hand firmly grasped the old man 's shoulder-wherever they were now , they were in it together . If only I could afford to succumb to this depleting sorrow , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a smashed box , things would be much simpler . Below the After photo there was a shot of the Lake-in-the-Hills Mall at night , all glaring neon blue , neon yellow , and neon pink . <p> I needed the job . I calculated : if I got si , ooo a month , I could pay the April rent , and a part of the March rent right off , and then buy a mattress for $50 or so . I had butterflies in my stomach , ripping off one another 's wings , biting viciously through one another 's abdomens . The lawn in front of the Ort Institute had spring sores . Over the bushes a fleet of gnats hovered , still dizzy from a long slumber , deciding what to do : settle for the lumpen greenness of the bushes , or fly into a windshield and end it all with a splatter . <p> The receptionist was a slender woman , thickly made-up , as if she never unmade herself , but kept adding layers and layers . " Take seat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if suspicious of me . I sat on an ochre sofa , and as I landed a nickel leapt up at me from the other end of the sofa , so I pocketed it . The receptionist talked over the phone , her lips so close to the earpiece that she smudged it with lipstick , glancing at me all along , as if she were describing me : he is tall and chunky , a cubical head , not very well-dressed , speaks with an Eastern European accent , a scar stretching across his throat . Across the hall stood a menorah on a pedestal , at the foot of which there was an inscription in Hebrew . From somewhere beyond the menorah , I could hear a discordant choir chanting rigid consonants and willowy vowels : <p> I have never read Moby Dick . <p> I have never seen the Grand Canyon . <p> I have never been in New York . <p> I have never been rich . <p> The walls were pale brown , and the carpets were dispirited brown , and the woman who walked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted , stretching an invisible leash to the end . " Hi ! " she said . " I am Robin . " She spoke in a belabored , warbly way , eager to be liked , but sensing that the chances were slim . I introduced myself , and got off the sofa quickly , so I could catch up with her . We passed an announcement board with leaflets handwritten in Russian . There were doors suggesting dark basements , and the floor was patterned with chaotic footprints , as if somebody had danced drunk in muddy boots . Robin flew down the hall and flung open a door , then stood waiting for me to go inside . Her eyes were one size too big for her face with gullies filled to the brim with powder . In a flash , I recognized how ludicrous my hope was , how comfortably everything was beyond the reach of my will . " Come on in , and take a seat , " she said . " I am going to get Marcus . " <p> I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it smelled of sharpened pencils and paper glue and Robin 's perfume and burnt coffee and chalk . On a round table , there was a nightmarish chain of cup rings , and a coffee cup ( the possible culprit ) next to an abandoned dictionary . <p> From a pile of newspapers on the table , the front page was facing me : " Defenses Collapse in Gorazde . " When I was thirteen I had spent the summer at a seaside resort for Tito 's pioneers and fallen in love with a girl from Gorazde . Her name was Emina , and she taught me to kiss using my tongue , and she let me touch her breasts-she was the first girl I had ever touched who wore a bra . " U.S. Seizes Boat Carrying 111 Immigrants , ' a headline read . My palms were sweating , my fingertips moist , and the paper smudged up my whorls , making them visible . I had once read a pulp novel in which there was a genius criminal , the notorious King of Midnight , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his distinctive voice . The ceiling fan revolved on the coffee surface , slightly curved . Someone named Ronald " Ron Rogers " Michalak had died-he was a beloved husband of the late Patricia . Sunny skies warmed most of the nation . The Bulls bowed , but did not look back . Chicago Jews celebrated Passover . <p> A woman opened the door and stepped in , still holding the door with her left hand , as if ready to escape . " Is Robin around ? " she asked . The sleeves of her blue shirt were rolled up , and I could see the sinews of her forearms fighting off the weight of the door . <p> " No " I said . " She went to find Marcus . I am waiting for her , too . " <p> " I 'll just come back later , " she said . She turned around , and I recognized the back of her head : the edge of her blue collar , and a lean neck with a feathery vine growing toward the mainland of her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train , sitting in front of me . I could see the wings of her earrings on the inside of her earlobes , and stray hairs touching the tips of her ears as she slipped out . " Massacres Rage On , " a headline read . " Bodies Pile Up in Rwanda . " <p> Robin seemed to have oversized glass marbles instead of eyeballs , like a doll-she was either not blinking or she was blinking when I was blinking . Her eyelashes bent abruptly upwards , like little scythes . Marcus was puckering his upper lip so his mustache hair could touch his abundant nostril hair , as if forcing them to couple . He looked at me cautiously , his hands comfortably placed on his belly ledge . <p> " Do you have any previous teaching experience ? " Robin asked . <p> " No , " I said . " But I have huge learning experience . " <p> " These people can be demanding , " she said . An ambulance passed down the street chirruping hysterically . <p> " This job , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires patience . Petulance just would not do it . ' <p> Robin glanced at him , frowned , then restored her grimace of a befuddled doll . I had no idea what " petulance " meant , and the dictionary was out of my reach . <p> " What is your point of origin ? " Marcus asked . <p> " Sarajevo , Bosnia , " I said . <p> " Oh , man , " Robin said . " That is so neat . It is so great to be from other cultures . " <p> " I spent years studying other cultures , " Marcus said . He leaned forward and whispered : " I used to work for the Government . " <p> " Really , " I said . Robin 's complexion was flaming now-her cheeks ruddy , burning through the blanket of makeup . <p> " Yes . In the NSA , the DLI , the Slavic languages section , translating all kinds-all kinds-of information , " Marcus said . " I can peruse seventeen languages . " <p> " Wow ! " Robin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Dobar dan ! " I replied . <p> " Da li je ovo zooloski vrt ? " <p> " Holy moly ! " Robin said . " What does that mean ? " <p> " Good day . Good day , " I translated . " Is this the zoo ? " <p> Someone knocked and peeked through the door and said , " Teacher , I can talk to you ? " <p> " Not now , Mihalka , " Robin said . " Wait outside . ' <p> " It is a must , " Mihalka said . <p> I turned around and looked at him : his head was ascetically shaved , his skull scarred , and his face punched in by an immense force , as if he had been a boxer . A mountain ridge of wrinkles rose across his forehead . He reminded me of my uncle , who lived in Canada now , working as an exterminator . <p> " Just wait outside , Mihalka , " Robin said . <p> " Some of them possess scintillating minds , and some have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sorry , " I said . " I do not understand everything that you say . <p> " He is from Czechoslovakia , ' Robin said . " You are from Czechoslovakia , too , right ? " <p> " He is from Yugoslavia , " Marcus said . " It 's a war-torn country . " <p> " I am from Bosnia ; ' I said . <p> " You know " Marcus said , " I was on a mission in Bosnia once . I met some brave men and beautiful women there . " <p> " When was that ? " Robin asked , and rubbed her temple . The skin on it wrinkled and unwrinkled under her finger , the pain still untouched . It must have taken a lot of strength to maintain this expression of permanent bafflement . <p> " Long time ago , " Marcus said . " I fell in love with a majestic , passionate woman , but fatuous circumstances took me elsewhere : ' Mihalka 's head popped in again without knocking , and Robin 's face changed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mihalka said . " I must tell you . " <p> Robin got up , rolled her eyes to the tilt , and went out . Marcus surveyed my face , trying to get into my eyes , then nodded , having found the expected evidence . <p> " You know a lot about life , do n't you ? " he said . " It has n't been easy , has it ? " " I do not know , " I said , uncomfortably . " Which life ? " <p> " You look like someone who knows a lot . " He sighed , recalling a host of pleasant memories . <p> Robin walked back in , shaking her head and rolling her eyes , as if she had just heard the strangest confession . <p> " Why do n't we visit a few classrooms , " Marcus said , " so you can see what takes place in them . " <p> " All right , " I said . <p> " I do not understand these people , " Robin said , still shaking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We walked up the stairs , awkwardly careful not to be too far from or too close to one another . The back pocket of Marcus 's pants gaped open , and a bundle of envelopes was about to fall out . I ascended in the wake of Robin 's sugary perfume and the wet-bandage smell of her armpits . <p> We stopped in front of one of the classroom doors , Robin conspiratorialy whispering to me : " This is level two , pretty basic . You might be teaching a lower level , so this could be interesting to you . ' <p> " Do not be vexed by the student body , " Marcus said . " They are a little sedate occasionally . " <p> " Okay , " I said . <p> Robin opened the door , and we walked in . <p> " Hi , guys ! " the teacher said the moment she saw us . " I am Jennifer . " <p> She had a deep-blue sweater and a lacy collar , a narrow waist and a wide skirt , so that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , and a willow-tree crown of hair . There was a map of the world on the wall behind her-North America was in its center and the oceans of the world were the same hue as Jennifer 's sweater . <p> " Do not be surprised , " Marcus said slowly to the class . " We are just visiting different classes , exposing him " - he pointed at me " to the trials and tribulations of language acquisition . " <p> As Marcus was speaking , the people in the class tightened , as if the room itself had contracted : the older women in the first row , the veteran mothers , sporting gigantic amber brooches on their bosoms , gripped their pencils ; the men behind them , with tuber noses and the yellowish faces of chain-smokers , sunk in their chairs ; a young man in the corner with a long , unkempt beard bent over his notebook . I could see a herd of distorted pyramids appearing in the margins . <p> " All rightie , " Jennifer said . " We do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class , expecting them to beam back , but they did n't . <p> " Do we ? " she said with a tinge of threat in her voice . <p> " Yes , we do : ' the class chanted back . <p> " You mean : No , we do n't " Jennifer said . <p> " No , we do n't , " the first row , only , responded . <p> " Okey-dokey , " she said , went to the chalkboard , erased Simple Present Tense , and wrote Passover . We hovered near the door , ready to escape . Marcus knotted his arms on his chest , while Robin 's eyelids throbbed incessantly . <p> " What is Passover ? " Jennifer asked , and with an optimistic face panned over the class . They stared at her , not moving , congealed in collective silence . <p> " What is Passover ? Sergei ? " <p> Sergei-a man with a collection of warts sprouting randomly all over his face , and the greenest eyes I had ever seen-scowled at Jennifer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips and straightened up in his chair , clearly determined not to say a word . <p> " What is Passover ? " <p> " Jewish vacation , " said a woman in the first row , in a voice like whistling steam . <p> " A Jewish holiday . Great ! " Jennifer said . " And what do Jewish people do for Passover ? " <p> A chair screeched in the back . The veteran mothers flipped through their books languidly . The young man in the back looked out the window . The raindrops began crawling down the pane . <p> " What do Jewish people do for Passover ? " Jennifer asked again , not giving up on her smile , but glancing at Marcus warily . <p> They said nothing . <p> " How many of you are Jewish ? " she asked . She stepped away from the chalkboard and toward them . <p> " Do n't be frightened , " Marcus said . <p> Two first-row women raised their hands , and then another half a dozen . <p> " Okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Sofya took her glasses off-her eyes were blue , and she had a crescent scar under her left eye . <p> " Jewish people run from Egypt , " she said reluctantly , as if it were a well-kept secret . <p> " But what do they do today ? " Jennifer asked . <p> The silence filled up every corner of the classroom . I could hear the storm growing : the staccato rain against the windows , the swooshing of trees , the anger and the sorrow . <p> " We must depart , " Marcus announced , without waiting for an answer , as Sofya 's words stopped at the edge of her lips . <p> " Do svidaniya ! " Sergei said . <p> So we departed . Jennifer said to her class : " Oh , guys , you can do better than that : ' <p> " This is level seven : ' Marcus said .

On the board , Siamese twins was written , along with abdomen , ache , dysfunction , solitude . <p> " You may proceed , " Marcus said . The teacher was the woman from the train , and I realized how pretty she was . She smiled feebly at us and said , " We are reading an article about Ronnie and Donnie , the Siamese twins . " She had a pointed chin ; fair , boyish hair ; dark eyes with two delicate eyebrow horizons . She gave us photocopies of the article . Ronnie and Donnie were facing the camera , their abdomens attached , their faces identical : large glasses , big jutted jaws , torturous smiles . They had four legs , and only one torso . <p> " Ugh , gross ! " Robin said and ardently wrinkled her nose . <p> " Pretty bad , " Marcus said . <p> " I must say , " the man whom I recognized as Mihalka said , " that it is not perfectly pleasant when I watch them .

" When I had been a little child , I had had a friend who had had a big head . " <p> He made a vast circle around his head with his index finger , suggesting the immense circumference . <p> " Every child had told him about his big head and had kicked him with a big stick on his head .

She had chalk smudges all over her denimmed thighs . The white-haired woman and her son exchanged glances . <p> " I must know past perfect , " Mihalka said and shrugged resignedly , as if past perfect were death and he were ready for it . " The Nazis , " the fourth man said , " killed all people like that . ' <p> He had a square , large head , and his face was familiar , with the grimaces of someone from former Yugoslavia : generous facial movements and oscillating eyebrows . He shaped and then sliced obscure objects in front of him with his hands , apparently angry at the molecules of air . <p> " They cooked them and tooked their bones and put them in museum , " he said . " They wanted German people to watch monsters . " <p> " Ugh , gross , " Robin said , and shook her head , with her tongue out . <p> " Yes , " the teacher said pensively , with her index finger touching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asymmetrical knobs . I imagined stroking that wrist , then her sinewy forearm , then her shoulder , and , finally , her neck . She continued : " They would show the skeletons of midgets and Siamese twins in public exhibitions , in order to convince the German people they were superior . " <p> The fourth man was looking out the window now , watching the storm , jerking his left knee , his hands touching his thighs . <p> " There had been one scientist who had gathered human heads , and he had wrote one book for Himmler , and his soldiers must have read it to think Jews had been monsters , " Mihalka said . <p> " I think you use past perfect too many times , " the woman with the son scoffed . <p> " Excuse me , " Mihalka said .

They also feel the same pain , which is not surprising  --  surprising-since they share a few internal-internal-organs . The pain , they like to say , is **38;1362;TOOLONG , or sometimes even-doubled . " <p> The fourth man propped his chin on his left hand . His Adam 's apple flexed a little , like a Ping-Pong ball . He stroked his chin with the back of his hand , occasionally looking out the window at the storm . His ears were small , like a child 's . <p> " Thank you , Paul , " the teacher said . " Do we understand this ? " <p> " Doubled means two times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " his mother said . <p> " Okay . Joseph , why do n't you go on ? " the teacher said . <p> The fourth man began reading in a very low voice , as if confessing : " Ronnie and Donnie give a new meaning to the word insep-inseparable . ' A lot of people think that the worst thing is the lack of-privacy , ' Ronnie says , ' but they do n't understand what is it like-what it is like-to share not only your life , but your body as well , with someone that you love . Donnie is me , and I am Donnie . ' " <p> A boy kneeling on the soft ground over a constellation of marbles , brushing away pebbles and twigs between the two marbles a foot apart : one of those two marbles was small with three orange fins inside the glass globe ; the other one was solid marble white . He picked up the orange marble , got his knees off the ground , and squatted . He wrapped his index finger around the marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to launch the marble . He aimed at the white marble , closing his left eye , squinting with his right one , then released it . His marble flew low over the dirt and then hit the white one-ping ! - and the boy smiled . The white marble was mine , and I lost it , and the boy was Jozef Pronek , the man reading about Ronnie and Donnie . I remembered him , there he was , out of nowhere . I was bedazzled by the clarity of the memory . <p> " ' What people often do n't realize ; Ronnie says , ' is that if one of us dies , the other one is going to die too , ' " Pronek read . <p> He had lived in the building across the street from mine , which had displaced a set of decrepit houses with overgrown gardens . My friends and I used to roam the gardens , as if they were unexplored continents . We would eat cabbage as if it were exotic fruit ; we would burn cabbage snails in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other kids . We found a stray , scabby dog and imagined it to be our guard dog , and we patrolled the gardens . So when they built a fence around the gardens and started digging them up , the world went askew . They built an ugly high-rise , which we hated along with its tenants . We would throw stones into the windows of the building and set their garbage on fire . We would corner a kid from the building and beat him up viciously . Pronek lived in the building , and when we cornered him , he would never put up a fight-his nose would bleed , and he would look at us with scorching fury , and then he would just walk away . Eventually , the war against the building withered away , and we ended up playing with those kids . They were not our enemies any longer , but they were not our friends , either . They were still newcomers , some of them spoke with strange non-Sarajevan accents , and we were the natives . We let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we never failed to let them know that . <p> And here he was , reading in heavily accented English , not looking up . <p> " When they were children , they were known for being good at climbing trees , where they would-hid-hide from other children and watch them play . ' It was strange , ' Will Senson , a childhood friend says . ' You would look up and there would be four eyes-star-staring at you from above . " <p> " Thank you , Joseph ! " the teacher said . <p> Pronek looked up straight at me . I did n't know if he could recognize me-I had changed a lot , having gone through a long and debilitating illness-but he was staring at me . I looked away , my heart thundering inside . How did he get here ? Was he in Sarajevo under siege ? Or was he besieging it ? I had n't talked to him in years . He leaned back in his chair , but my gaze was avoiding his . What should I say to him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> " This is morbid , " Robin whispered to Marcus . <p> " Rather saturnine it is ; ' Marcus said , and got up to leave , so I obediently stood up . As I was leaving the classroom , I glanced one more time at Pronek , and he looked straight back at me , perhaps-and perhaps not-recognizing me . He still seemed angry . <p> We went back to the office . I said , " I would really like to work here . " <p> " We could sure use you , " Robin said . <p> " We 'll call you by the end of the week , " Marcus said . <p> Outside , dark umbrellas were weighing down on people . The wind sides of the tree trunks were soaked ; the lee-side branches shivered in anticipation of more rain , wagging their twiggy ends at me as if saying , No , no , I would n't do that . But I did , I walked through the rain-it was cold . I passed a dingy building : a cat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidity of its darkness , watching me in complete , somber control . <p> And I remembered cornering a mouse-this had happened a long time ago-in the hall of my building , after it had made the mistake of leaving its tunnels . I tried to grab it by its tail , as it trembled in fearful rage . With the tips of my fingers I managed to grasp its tail-a rubbery tentacle-and lift it off the ground . I remembered Pronek being there , watching me , hating me for what I was doing . The mouse twitched in my hand , desperate , and I giggled , enjoying my power-there must have been some girls around , too-until the mouse somehow swung itself upwards and bit my palm , two little needles piercing my skin . Pronek was watching me with a smirk , as if he knew all along what would happen . I screamed and let the mouse go , and it scurried away , happy to be alive . I was gripping my right hand , trying to prevent the pain from spreading . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair and clothes completely wet , asked me . She accosted me in front of my building , as if she 'd been waiting for me . " I losed my dog . " <p> " No , I am sorry , " I said . <p> " You sure ? Little dog . " <p> " I am sure. , <p> She went on down the rain-soaked street , looking between and under the cars and into the narrow spaces between buildings , yelling , " Lucky Boy ! " all along . I could hear the storm rumbling away . <p> I walked into my apartment , the floors creaked me a welcome , and I suddenly felt a tide of warm giddiness overwhelming me , dewing my neck . In my jacket , I sat down on the floor , where the futon used to be , with a frightening premonition that most of the things in this world would go on existing whether I lived or died . There was a hole in the world , and I fit right into it ; if I perished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing . I should have told Pronek who I was , I needed him to know . " Lucky Boy ! " I heard the woman shouting . " Where are you ? Where you go ? " <p> Author Affiliation
