Chapter One Molly Moon looked down at her pink , blotchy legs . It was n't the bathwater that was making them mottled like Spam ; they were always that color . And so skinny . Maybe one day , like an ugly duckling turning into a swan , her knock-kneed legs might grow into the most beautiful legs in the world . Some hope . Molly leaned back until her curly brown hair and her ears were under the water . She stared at the fly-specked yellow paint that was peeling off the wall and at the damp patch on the ceiling where strange mushrooms grew . Water filled her ears and the world sounded foggy and far away . Molly shut her eyes . It was an ordinary November evening , and she was in a shabby bathroom in a crumbling building called the Hardwick House Orphanage . She imagined flying over it like a bird , looking down at its gray slate roof and its bramble-filled garden . She imagined flying higher until she was looking down on the hillside where Hardwick village lay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could see the whole of the town of Briersville beyond it . As Molly flew higher and higher , she saw the rest of the country and now the coastline , too , with sea on all sides . Her mind rocketed upward until she was flying in space , looking down at the earth . And there she hovered . Molly liked to fly away from the world in her imagination . It was relaxing . And often , when she was in this state , she 'd feel different . Molly had this special feeling tonight , as if something exciting or strange were about to happen to her . The last time she 'd felt special , she 'd found a half-eaten packet of candy on the pavement in the village . The time before , she 'd got away with watching two hours of evening television instead of one . Molly wondered what surprise would greet her this time . Then she opened her eyes and was back in the bath . She looked at her distorted reflection in the underside of the chrome tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that ? Was that pink lump of dough her face ? Was that potato her nose ? Were those small green lights her eyes ? Someone was hammering downstairs . That was strange ; no one ever mended anything in Hardwick House . Then Molly realized that the hammering was someone banging on the bathroom door . Trouble . Molly shot up and hit her head on the tap . The banging outside was very loud now , and with it came a fierce bark . " Molly Moon , open this door at once ! If you do n't , I 'll be forced to use a master key . " Molly could hear keys rattling on a ring . She looked at the level of her bathwater and gasped . It was much too deep and well over the allowed level . She pulled the plug out and wrapped herself in her towel . Just in time . The door swung open . Miss Adderstone was in and darting to the bathtub , her scaly nose wrinkling as she discovered the deep , draining water . She rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As I suspected , " she hissed . " Intentional flouting of orphanage rules . " Miss Adderstone 's eyes glinted spitefully as she took a tape measure from her pocket . She pulled the metal strip out and , making excited slurping noises as she sucked on her loose false teeth , she measured how far Molly 's bath had gone over the red line painted round the sides of the tub . Molly 's teeth chattered . Her knees were now turning blue and blotchy , and the palms of her hands began sweating , as they always did whenever she was excited or nervous . Miss Adderstone shook the tape measure , dried it on Molly 's shirt , then snapped it shut . Molly braced herself to face the wiry spinster , who , with her short gray hair and hairy face , looked more like a Mr. than a Miss . " Your bath is thirty centimeters deep , " Miss Adderstone announced . " Allowing for the amount that had already been deceitfully run out while I was knocking at the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know that baths are only supposed to be ten centimeters deep . Your bath was four times that deep , so you have , in effect , used up your next three baths . So , Molly , you are forbidden to have a bath for the next three weeks . As for a punishment ... " Miss Adderstone picked up Molly 's toothbrush . Molly 's heart sank . She knew what was coming next . Miss Adderstone glared at Molly with her dull , black eyes . Her face heaved in a monstrous way as her tongue dislodged her teeth and moved them around in her mouth before settling them back down on her gums . She thrust the toothbrush at Molly . " This week you will be toilet monitor . I want the toilets spotless , Molly , and this is the brush you 'll be using . And do n't think you can get away with using the toilet brush , because I 'll be watching you . " Miss Adderstone gave one last , satisfied suck on her teeth and left the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the something that she 'd felt was going to happen tonight was simply trouble . She stared at her worn-out toothbrush , hoping that her friend Rocky would let her share his . As she picked at a loose thread on her balding old towel , she wondered what it would be like to be wrapped up in a fluffy white towel like the ones in TV ads . Softness is the sign , Everyone feels fine , Wash your towels in ... Clou-oud Ni-i-n-e . Molly loved ads . They showed how comfortable and happy life could be-filled with friends-friends who were always happy to see Molly when she visited them in her mind . Wrap yourself in luxury time Clou-oud Ni-i-n-e ... ( Continues ... )
