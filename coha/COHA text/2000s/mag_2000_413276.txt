Join us at everyone 's favorite holiday feast . // The aromas of turkey , pork loins , dressing , and sweet potatoes announce magnificent Thanksgiving meals for taste testing as our Foods staff prepares for the November issue of Southern Living . We salivate at the feasts spread before us , and we share with each other our own holiday traditions . Our own styles , we have found , are as varied as those of our readers . Some of us choose a casual approach , while others celebrate Thanksgiving as the most formal meal of the year . But we all agree that great food-and lots of it-is the must on this day of days . Jan Moon of our Test Kitchens staff says formality sets the tone for her family 's celebration . " We all get dressed up , and Mother uses linen napkins , china , crystal , and silver . All the family members bring the dishes , assuring that the meal will be bountiful . It 's the one time of year we can count on everyone being there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanksgiving , no matter what . " The family of Vie Warshaw , another Test Kitchens staff member , has always enjoyed a casual feast . Now Vie gathers with her children , often traveling up North to her daughter 's home where there might be beef tenderloin in addition to the turkey . " As in most families , food is the focus of this very special day , " she says . " We eat , put it away , relax for a while , then pull it out again . " Taking a cue from Vie and others , we devised a meal served in a casual setting . Pork loin offers a flavorful alternative or addition to turkey ( see turkey recipe on page 77 ) . And serve dinner on china with silver utensils if you prefer ; it will taste wonderful either way .
