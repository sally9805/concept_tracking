Which surprise teams will be playing in October ? Of the Tigers , Reds and Blue Jays -- the year 's most unexpected division title contenders --  Detroit has the best chance of making the playoffs because of its young and talented pitching staff , which at week 's end led the majors in ERA even though 38.7% of the team 's innings had been logged by hurlers under age 25 ( starters Jeremy Bonderman , Zach Miner and Justin Verlander , and setup man Joel Zumaya ) . The Tigers ' start is legit : They had outscored opponents 394-285 , by far the largest differential in the majors . As for Cincinnati , its hitters are first in the league in homers and fourth in runs scored , but the club has also been lucky : The Reds were 14-7 in one-run games and had been outscored 377-373 on the season . Toronto is dangerous because it has ace righthander Roy Halladay ( 9-2 , 3.07 ERA ) and a high-powered offense ( first in the majors in slugging percentage ) , but assuming the AL wild-card winner comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tigers each were on pace for more than 105 wins , the Blue Jays would have to hurdle the Yankees and the Red Sox , who have finished one-two in the East every year since 1998 , to reach the postseason. // Will a manager be fired during the season ? It 's been six years since an entire season elapsed without a managerial change . With eight managers in their first years on the job and 17 of 30 teams within five games of a postseason berth , no bench boss appears to be in even serious trouble . But that will change if Charlie Manuel 's Phillies ( 8-14 in June ) continue to underachieve. // How many players will hit 50 home runs ? From 2002 through ' 05 only three players hit 50 home runs in a season ; this year -- with home runs up 11.7% from last year at the same point -- six players ( Albert Pujols , Ryan Howard , Jim Thome , Alfonso Soriano , Adam Dunn and Carlos Lee ) were on pace to reach 50 . Of the six , however , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Soriano and Lee have yet to reach 40 . Despite a 15-day stint on the disabled list , Pujols , who hit his 26th homer last Friday , was still the major league leader ; if he stays healthy and sustains his current home run rate , the first baseman will make a serious run at 70 . ( He was on pace for 67. ) // Will the Mets win the NL East by 20 games ? Not since 1999 , when the Indians finished 21 1/2 games ahead of the White Sox in the AL Central , has a team won a division by 20 or more games . But the Mets have a chance to do so in the NL East , where their cushion was a seemingly insurmountable 11 1/2 games . And the margin could get wider in a hurry : The Marlins and the Nationals are rebuilding , and the reeling Phillies and Braves could unload prominent veterans in July . Look for New York -- which has MVP candidates in centerfielder Carlos Beltran and third baseman David Wright and a red-hot leadoff hitter in shortstop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final 33 games against teams with losing records . // So who 's going to the playoffs ? The Red Sox , White Sox , A 's and Tigers ( wild card ) in the AL ; the Mets , Cardinals , Dodgers and Astros ( wild card ) in the NL.
