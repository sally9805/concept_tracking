<p> Modern medicine has its limits for 82-year-old Chrim Sao , who rocks back and forth to the rhythms of Parkinson 's disease . <p> She ventured into a hospital last year for the first time in her life and came home barely able to walk . To heal herself , Sao relied on traditions of her native Cambodia . <p> She sacrificed a chicken in her living room and barbecued a pig 's head in the kitchen to ask the spirits of her parents and grandparents to give her back her soul and health . Then , after the idea came to her in a dream , she invited a Buddhist monk to her Riverdale home to recite prayers and bless her . <p> " After I made the sacrifice , and the monk came , I could walk to the bathroom and take a shower by myself , " she said . <p> The remedy  --  and her faith in it  --  might strike native-born Americans as odd , but metro Atlanta 's booming international population is increasingly bringing health care providers into contact with strikingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfamiliar with those cultures are encountering communications breakdowns and resistance by patients to essential tests and procedures . The problems can be profound and , in extreme cases , deadly . <p> Many Vietnamese patients , for example , balk when a doctor wants to draw blood . They do n't know the body naturally replenishes blood and worry losing too much blood will make them weak or anemic . <p> Some women from Somalia wo n't let a male gynecologist examine them without their husband or father present . Men make most important decisions in their culture . <p> " Even though the woman is the patient , you have to talk to the man , " said Dr. Alawode Oladele , director of refugee health services in DeKalb County . <p> Patients from Eastern Europe and Russia sometimes get anxious when a doctor orders an X-ray . <p> Oladele chalks it up to the 1986 explosion of a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine . The explosion spread radiation for thousands of miles and left the lingering impression people there already have been exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince them that they should get an X-ray , " Oladele said . <p> Many of his patients come to the hospital only after trying remedies that were passed down for generations . <p> Some Southeast Asians battle fever by mixing the dried gallbladder of a python with coconut milk or water . Others cool down by rubbing their bodies with a mixture of leaves and water and treat diabetes by drinking water boiled with dry grass . <p> Sao learned as a girl that the traditions of rural Cambodia prescribed boiled tree roots for fever . <p> She grew up in isolation , near just two or three other families , in a wooden house on a plain surrounded by rice fields . There were no doctors or nurses , and traditional treatments were handed down from one generation to the next . Sao learned to rub her skin with a coin if she lost her appetite , felt dizzy or had a headache and to sacrifice animals to appease the spirits that could affect her health . <p> Since coming to Georgia as a refugee in 1981 , Sao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of it on her nightstand along with four orange bottles containing the medicine that treats her Parkinson 's disease . The pill bottles stand beside a glass bottle of ointment she daubs on her skin before rubbing it with a coin , a technique she said is about as successful as more modern forms of relief . <p> " Sometimes it works , and sometimes it does n't , " Sao said through an interpreter . " It 's about the same as taking a Tylenol . " <p> She said she ca n't find the proper tree roots to boil to counter fever . <p> Physicians often ' clueless ' <p> Sao is like thousands of immigrants in Georgia who rely on home remedies from back home . <p> Immigrants from Colombia try to heal bruises and bumps by covering them with potatoes ; many Vietnamese rub warm boiled eggs over bruises . A Latino patient of Dr. Rachel Schonberger , a physician at the Community Health Center of North Fulton , treats her husband 's asthma by tossing aloe plants in a blender to make him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Schonberger joked . <p> To immigrants , health care customs in the United States also can seem odd . Americans " starve a cold and feed a fever " and warn children not to go outside with wet hair . And they reach for chicken soup when they get a runny nose  --  a folk remedy researchers say might have a basis in science . <p> The immigrant population in Georgia is so new most doctors and nurses do not appreciate the degree to which an immigrant 's culture can affect his or her treatment , said Susy Martorell , a social worker who gives cultural training to medical students and health care providers in metro Atlanta . <p> " If you talk to Joe Blow , doctor , they 're clueless , " Martorell said . <p> Language not the only barrier <p> But a few metro hospitals and medical schools have noticed . <p> Administrators at Emory Northlake Regional Medical Center in Tucker , a 120-bed hospital serving people who speak 72 languages , established an office of multinational relations in 1996 . Some medical students at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Grady Memorial Hospital is hiring more bilingual and bicultural employees . <p> Martorell said medical interpreters , not just doctors and nurses , need to be aware of culture . <p> Consider the Spanish-speaking patient who starts an exam by saying , " Me duele el corazon . " Translated literally , that means " My heart hurts , " but it 's a common Latin American phrase that really means " My heart is heavy " or " I 'm depressed . " If an interpreter does not know that , the doctor and patient almost certainly will waste time talking about cardiac problems that do not exist . <p> Oladele sees young women from places like Somalia and Latin America who say " no " when he asks to perform a Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer . They worry the test will compromise their virginity . <p> Some immigrants get upset if they visit a doctor and do not get a shot . " In a lot of developing countries , if you do n't get a shot or an injection of some sort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oladele said . " Language is just one barrier , but there are other barriers . " <p> Sometimes , when Vietnamese patients fret about a blood test , Oladele tells them to eat a certain food after they get home . He tells them the food will replenish their blood . Actually , the body naturally replenishes blood , but Oladele said it 's simpler to tell a harmless fib than to keep giving the same biology lesson . <p> Yung Krall , director of multinational relations at Emory Northlake Regional Medical Center , said Asian women often resist a suggested hysterectomy even if they have a cyst in their uterus or severe bleeding and cramps . Krall said the women worry that " they will not be desirable to their husband . " <p> " To Asian women , a hysterectomy is like being castrated , " Krall said . " She feels like she is disabled or wounded . " <p> Krall shares her story to reassure women . She is Asian herself , she had a hysterectomy , and she 's fine . A Vietnamese immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women usually go ahead with the surgery after she tells them the hysterectomy did not change her marriage . <p> Asians also can confound health care providers who are unfamiliar with their belief a balance of hot and cold in the body is the key to health . <p> Nurses in the United States routinely give chipped ice to women in labor , but Asians sometimes decline the ice . They believe it will upset the hot-cold relationship . And the pitcher of ice water that nurses typically bring to new mothers often goes untouched by Asians . Their culture says warm water restores a woman 's hot-cold balance after delivery . <p> Krall explained the hot-cold ideas to nurses at Emory Northlake . Now the nurses bring warm water to new Asian mothers . <p> A collision of ethics , medicine <p> On rare occasions , the clash between traditional health care beliefs and Western medicine is deadly . <p> Krall tells the story of a Vietnamese man who died shortly after coming to Georgia in 1975 . His ordeal began after his son got a cold . He used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thailand and Vietnam . You rub something like Tiger Balm or Vicks VapoRub on the skin and scratch the skin with a coin . The friction raises body temperature and can help someone with chills , Krall said . <p> After the Vietnamese man treated his son , an adult at a nearby church saw red marks on the boy and called police . Officers arrested the man on child abuse charges . Shamed , he hanged himself in jail . <p> Another common Asian treatment , called cupping , leaves purple marks that also are sometimes mistaken for signs of abuse . Immigrants heat a small cup and place it on the skin to suck out " bad air " that causes headaches and pain in the shoulder , back and chest . <p> Krall and Martorell said doctors and nurses in metro Atlanta are encountering a growing number of patients with mysterious marks and bruises caused by coining or cupping . <p> Andrea Henry , coordinator of interpretation services at Northside Hospital , recalled a Mexican woman who worried about her emotional health after a doctor suggested removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's culture , bile is linked to mood and emotional well-being . <p> " She kept saying , ' If you remove that , am I going to have more emotional upset ? ' " Henry said . " The doctor just kept trying to explain the physical , scientific side of it . " <p> Schonberger , the north Fulton doctor , has examined patients in metro Atlanta since 1976 and is accustomed to speaking plainly about death with Americans who are terminally ill . <p> " We have this attitude that the doctor tells the patient everything and lets him decide who to tell , " she said . <p> Some Koreans , though , ask Schonberger to shield the news of a terminal illness from elderly parents . They 're used to a culture in which doctors skirt the issue with the sickest patients and save straight talk for relatives . <p> " My ethics tell me one thing to do , and the culture of the patients tell me something else , " she said . <p> Allen Sa Ravuth also sees patients with unique perspectives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Georgia Mutual Assistance Association , a nonprofit organization that helps refugees . He understands from personal experience the sense of mysticism that swirls around traditional Cambodian views of illness . <p> When he was 13 or 14 and living in Cambodia , he and a friend hiked away from their village and came to a rock on a small hill . <p> " Do you know that rock can fly ? " the friend said . <p> " This is just a piece of stone that can fly nowhere , " Sa Ravuth said . <p> After they got home , a fever sickened Sa Ravuth . His parents gave him medicine , but his temperature kept going up . <p> They gave him a shot , but it did nothing to make him feel better . <p> After two or three days , his parents consulted an elderly folk healer . <p> He said their son had offended an invisible spirit near his village . Later , after questioning from his parents , Sa Ravuth told them what he had said about the rock that could not fly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificed a chicken to appease the spirit . <p> " My fever started coming down the next day , " he said . <p> Sa Ravuth said he trusts Western medicine but still gets quiet around temples and statues . <p> " I still remember that day , and I wonder what happened : How did it happen , and how did I get well ? " he said . " It 's unbelievable , but it happened to me . " Immigrant Chrim Sao , who lives in Riverdale , says the sacrifice of a chicken and a Buddhist monk 's prayers eased her Parkinson 's disease . / CHARLOTTE B. TEAGLE / Staff Photo : Chrim Sao
