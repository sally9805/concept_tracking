<p> Ronald Atkins and Debra Stewart are baffled about their respective children 's academic futures . Both have children in one of New York 's worst schools . Both have seen education experiments come and go . And both are being asked to consider a change that could profoundly affect their offsprings ' educational options . Parents in their Brooklyn neighborhood will soon vote on whether to convert a traditional school to a charter - an independent public school that would , in this case , be operated by a for-profit firm . They want what 's best for their kids . But like many parents around the US , these adults are being thrust into the role of instant policy experts who can negotiate a complex debate about competition and the ability of traditional schools to improve . In the process , they 're running up against a familiar problem : many promises , but minimal information . And increasingly , they 're balking . " What happens at school sets the tone for your child 's life , " Mr. Atkins says . " We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their confusion mirrors debates occurring at all levels of America 's educational establishment . It 's evidence that the familiar choice - even if it may not seem as good - still holds powerful sway in many neighborhoods . Even many of the so-called experts concede that they do n't yet know enough about the performance of companies like the New York-based Edison Schools , which hopes to take over five of the city 's worst-performing facilities . Although urban school districts from Dallas to Baltimore are experimenting with for-profit management of their public schools , little evidence yet exists that the strategy can produce results . " There has n't yet been any documented , long-term success , " says Octavio Visiedo , a former superintendent of Florida 's Dade County school system who is today chairman of for-profit Chancellor Academies , based in Miami . " The jury is still out . Anybody who tells you otherwise is not being realistic . " Edison is not the only player in this field , but it is one of only five or so such companies of significant size . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Dallas , six Edison schools will open this fall , while Detroit officials say they 're contemplating turning 13 of the city 's public schools over to the company . Get out the protest signs New York City Schools Chancellor Harold Levy was just one more big-city official to make the leap when he proposed that Edison enter the market . But he quickly confronted serious opposition despite Edison 's estimates that it has boosted test scores an average of 7 percent . Opposing studies , including one by the American Federation of Teachers , the country 's second-largest teachers union , claim Edison 's test results are faulty and incomplete . The AFT , perhaps not surprisingly , insists that the company 's track record is at best mixed and inconclusive . Important philosophical questions have emerged as well , including the ethics of making money by educating schoolchildren . Charges of racism have also surfaced . " There 's a feeling in the black and brown community that they 're profiting in the prison sector , " says Bertha Lewis , executive director of the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're saying , let 's go straight to the schools and make money . " But Edison is fighting back . It has held open meetings and question-and-answer sessions for parents , and offered them free bus trips to view Edison-run schools in Boston , Jersey City , Baltimore , and Washington . It also points to the laptop computers for each student , longer school days , nationally regarded curriculum plans , and structural improvements to buildings that house the low-performing schools . We do n't see failure here But for a significant number of parents , the choice is not obvious - nor are their schools necessarily failures . " There are many strengths to the school , " says Ms. Stewart of I.S. 320 , one of the schools in question . Her daughter , she says , has been successful there . Atkins points out that he has the home phone numbers of all the teachers . " They know me . With Edison , it will be a business . " " So Johnny will come home with a new textbook , " scoffs Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind that ? A for-profit company is all about self . " For Marshall Mitchell , the Edison executive who is heading up the company 's New York City campaign , such comments are frustrating . " What reward and what comfort is there in mediocrity ? " he asks . " Is familiarity enough ? " Some parents resist change in their schools simply because they 've become discouraged by too many unsuccessful waves of reform . " They 've been through multiple school designs , and there 's a real sense that promises have been delivered and then have been broken , " he says . But private-management companies may represent just one more swing of the pendulum . Hartford , Conn. , contracted with the Minneapolis-based , for-profit company Educational Alternatives Inc. in 1994 . The company 's assumptions about running the schools proved unrealistic , and relations between the management team and the school board quickly soured . The contract was terminated in 1996 , when the state took over the schools and hired an experienced superintendent who has since succeeded in raising test scores in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management are far from conclusive . " Many of the early firms were naive , " says Jane Hannaway , director of the Education Policy Center at the Urban Institute in Washington . " To put Edison in that category would be unfair . " Parental support , board opposition In San Francisco , Edison is coming under fire for other reasons . There , parents are defending the company , while the school board wants to send it packing . The company currently manages a city charter school , and in two years has succeeded in boosting test scores and generally pleasing parents . But many teachers - asked to work more days and longer hours - have left , and the city 's school board says it has serious philosophical objections to for-profit school companies . Some New York community organizations share those concerns . " I have no doubt that if Edison took over these five schools , they 'd do a good job , " says Ernest Clayton , president of New York 's United Parents Association . His concern is the long-term impact . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public school system , " he insists . " Eventually you will end up with another bureaucracy , but this one will be focused on making a profit . " Such worries are theoretical , and do n't interest the average parent , says Edison 's Mr. Mitchell . " That kind of debate and objection is almost a leisure-class activity , " he says . " What most parents really care about is the potential to improve student achievement . " So do most observers of the education scene , says Henry Levin , director of the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Columbia University 's Teachers College in New York . " What if suddenly we brought in loads of for-profits and they did a wonderful job ? " he asks . " All of us would say , yes , if they can do that , we support them . " Realistically , he says , it will require at least three more years before enough data exist to back up claims of success . Meanwhile , implementation will continue . " The jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , " says Mary Fulton , policy analyst for the Education Commission of the States in Denver . The US education establishment is good at enthusiastically latching on to new ideas , she says . " What we 're not so good at is the evaluation process .
