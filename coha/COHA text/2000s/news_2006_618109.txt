<p> Reidsville  --  Colvin C. " Butch " Hinton III confessed Monday to murdering Shannon Melendi , telling authorities he raped and strangled the Emory University student before burning her body 12 years ago . <p> " I hate what I done , " Hinton said in a meeting with authorities at Georgia State Prison , where he is serving a life sentence for the murder . <p> It marked the first time Hinton confessed to the murder , and his account answered questions that had been swirling around the high-profile case for more than a decade . <p> Because Melendi 's body was never found , no one was certain how she died or how Hinton might have disposed of her . And Hinton provided chilling details of the crime , including how he left Melendi tied up at his house while he went to the movies before he killed her . <p> Melendi , 19 , was last seen alive on March 26 , 1994 , at a DeKalb County softball complex where she worked . Her disappearance prompted an intense search by her family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part time at the Carter Center , and former President Jimmy Carter helped make sure the FBI was involved in the case . As the search continued , Shannon 's photo appeared on billboards and on television shows such as " America 's Most Wanted . " <p> All the while , Hinton said Monday , Melendi 's ashes had been discarded . <p> And to throw off the police , Hinton admitted Monday to sneaking away from his job at a Delta Air Lines maintenance facility and calling Emory to pose as a person who had been holding Melendi . <p> That call was traced to a pay phone in McDonough , where authorities found a ring belonging to Melendi enclosed in a bag and wrapped in tape . <p> During Monday 's interview with law enforcement authorities and prison officials  --  attended by an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter  --  Hinton said he approached Melendi that day at the softball complex , where he was an umpire , and gave Melendi a ride to Burger King to have lunch . <p> Then , he tricked her into driving his car by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once she was behind the wheel , Hinton pulled a knife and forced Melendi to drive to his Clayton County home , he said . He then raped her twice and held her there for about 12 hours . <p> He said he left her tied up at the house twice  --  once while he went back to the softball complex to move her car and a second time to go to the movies with relatives in the hopes of establishing an alibi , he said . <p> Then , he strangled her with a necktie and burned her body in his yard , he said . <p> " I know I 'll never , ever be forgiven by most people . And I accept that , " Hinton said Monday . " But I am so sorry . I 've hurt so many people with the lies I 've told . " <p> During his confession , Hinton sat at the head of a conference table with his hands folded . He was matter of fact in describing his crime , occasionally gesturing with his hands to describe where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long was a prime suspect in Melendi 's disappearance because of past sex offenses , but he was n't indicted for her murder until 10 years later . <p> Hinton went to federal prison in 1996 for arson  --  setting fire to his house for insurance money  --  and inmates who served time with him helped build the case against him . <p> They claimed he talked about disposing of a body . One said Hinton awoke screaming one night and said , " I did n't kill her . The demon inside of me killed her . " <p> Last September , he was convicted of the murder in a DeKalb County court  --  even though investigators never found Melendi 's body and prosecutors could not say when or where she was killed . <p> Hinton became the first person convicted of murder in Georgia in a " no body , no crime scene " case . <p> Monday 's confession , said DeKalb County District Attorney Gwen Keyes Fleming , was the " final chapter " in the case . <p> " We had no body . No crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleming said at an afternoon news conference . " Now , we have a confession . " <p> Luis Melendi , Shannon 's father , said Hinton 's account of her kidnapping and murder was " just like I suspected . " <p> The confession , he said , proved that Shannon did nothing wrong , contrary to defense suggestions during Hinton 's appeal that she might have been killed by an unknown drug dealer or boyfriend . <p> Melendi , who lives in Key Largo , Fla. , had been asked if he wanted to attend Hinton 's confession Monday , but declined , he said . <p> Hinton has wanted to confess since seeing Melendi 's family at his trial , he said Monday . But he held out some hope of freedom until the Georgia Supreme Court upheld his conviction last month . On Monday , the court denied Hinton 's motion for reconsideration of his appeal . <p> John Petrey , the lead prosecutor in Hinton 's trial , called the confession self-serving . <p> Hinton , he said , " tries to convince people now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Melendi family , he would n't be saying this in 2006 . " <p> DeKalb Police Sgt. Ray Ice , one of the investigators who searched Hinton 's property shortly after Melendi 's disappearance , said he was " very skeptical " of Hinton 's claim that he was able to completely burn the body so quickly without the odor being detected by anyone , including Hinton 's wife , who returned home the same day that Hinton said he burned the body . <p> Mitzi Prochnow , who owns a Virginia Highland women 's boutique that Melendi frequented , said she hopes Hinton 's confession helps her family " put this behind them . " <p> In the days following Melendi 's disappearance , Prochnow agreed to put Melendi 's missing person 's poster in the window of her shop , Mitzi &; Romano on North Highland Avenue . <p> It remained there until Hinton 's conviction last year , when Prochnow gave it to Melendi 's sister , Monique . <p> Others were surprised by Monday 's confession . <p> " I 'm really shocked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who burst into tears when a reporter told her about Hinton 's confession . <p> " For 12 years , I have wondered what 's happened . I 've had dreams about Shannon , " said Vasquez , who is 31 and now a business editor at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper . <p> " There was some closure that came with the trial , but we still did n't really know what happened . I have n't had these emotions for years , but this is bringing it all back .
