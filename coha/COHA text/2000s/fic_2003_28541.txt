Chapter One Susan had a hard time believing it had come to this . If someone had told her a week ago that she would be seriously considering hiring a private investigator , she would have laughed . People came to her for help . She was the sensible , self-reliant one who always handled whatever problem came her way . At least , she had been . She drove past the White Knight Investigations ' offices every day on her way to work . When You Need Help , Call On A White Knight , the sign said . The promise implicit in that motto never failed to conjure up the romantic image of a tall , stalwart warrior in silver armor charging on his sturdy steed to help some hapless heroine . A nice fantasy . But the key word here was fantasy . Even if the King Arthur legends could be believed and men with high ideals had rescued damsels in distress in the sixth century , she knew perfectly well that damsels unlucky or foolish enough to get themselves into distressful situations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet knowing all that did n't stop her from slowing as she approached the White Knight offices this morning . She wanted to believe , because she was in a mess . And she gladly would have traded all the idealistic heroes in history on white horses for the help of one fat , balding modern-day cynic driving a VW Bug - as long as he was a competent and intelligent investigator . Their number was on the sign . Maybe she 'd call for an appointment . Then again , maybe not . She 'd gotten herself into a situation that was as embarrassing as hell for herself to accept , much less explain to someone else . An unexpected light in the office window had Susan turning the steering wheel of her SUV . The offices were always dark at this hour . That light beamed down on her like a special invitation , a message that someone waited for her up there , someone who would listen and would be willing to help . She maneuvered her vehicle into the parking lot and switched off the engine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drizzle smeared her windshield , uncomfortably aware that levelheaded women did n't lead their lives by attributing the guiding hand of fate to an unexpected office light . Still , as long as she was here , it probably would n't hurt to go up . The front door to the office-building complex was open , a bakery shop on the first floor already filling the foyer with the warm aromas of yeast and rising dough . Normally such smells would have been welcome . But today she could n't get away from them quickly enough . She dashed for the elevator and punched the button for the top floor where the White Knight offices were located . The elevator made its journey with an efficient swoosh of gears . When the doors opened , she stepped out on a lovely curved landing . A floor-to-ceiling picture window overlooked the small city of Silver Valley , jewel-like in the early morning light . As tempted as she was to linger over the dazzling scene , she knew that if she did n't continue with this sudden impulse , her common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her vehicle . The light she had seen from the street was spilling out from the reception area of the White Knight offices . Her footsteps made no sound on the thick carpet as she made her way toward it . She halted in the shadows just outside the open door and peered inside . Her eyes swept over the oak desk , the thick gold carpet , the tasteful assortment of art hanging on the pastel walls , the impressive expanse of windows . But it was the man facing those windows who claimed her real attention . He was at least six-three , with shoulders and arms like a logger 's . His full bark-brown hair was cleanly cut at the nape of his neck . A dark green sweater stretched over his muscled back . Tailored black slacks hugged his long legs . One of his huge hands hung casually by his side . The other was holding something in front of him that she could n't see . The solid strength of his body and the calm , innate confidence in his stance put Susan immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bedroom window when she was a child . That cedar had borne the weight of her treehouse , weathered the worst of winter 's storms and soaked up the tears shed by her young self . Her heart filled with sudden hope . Maybe , just maybe , the impulse that had brought her here would n't prove to be so crazy , after all . David savored his coffee as he watched the traffic beneath his window . Mornings were always his favorite part of the day ; he enjoyed watching the world wake up and get busy , especially in this part of the world . Western Washington would n't push open its coffin lid of clouds to let in any real sun until summer . He did n't mind enduring the months of overcast skies ahead . The rain was a familiar companion , and he had learned that there was comfort in the familiar . A man could handle anything when he knew what to expect . A long , difficult case now hinged on an interview he would conduct with his client 's runaway daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was key . He was counting on what he had to show her to help him . But his approach also had to be right . He had come in early so as to plan what he would say to her . He checked his watch . Barely eight . He had another full hour before the office officially opened and anyone else arrived . Plenty of time to - " Excuse me . " David spun around so sharply at the sound of the unexpected voice behind him that coffee splashed out of his cup . He found himself suddenly face-to-face with large , luminous eyes the color of summer clover . She stood in the doorway , a slim silhouette in a dark business suit with matching , low-heeled pumps . Across her forehead was a curve of shiny , golden-brown bangs . The rest of her hair fell in one long , thick braid to the gentle swell of her right breast . Her cosmetic-free face reflected the pink , creamy glow of youth . She did n't look a day over twenty-one . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and resonant voice vibrated through David like the melody of a forgotten song . She took a tentative step into the room . " If you have some paper towels , I can try to soak up that stain on the carpet . " " No , " he said in a tone that was far too abrupt and gruff and had nothing whatsoever to do with her offer to help and everything to do with the unwelcome surprise of her . His thoughts must have shown on his face , because her open , expectant expression quickly faded . " I 've obviously come at a bad time , " she said , and turned to leave . " No , " he heard himself barking again in that same uncivil tone . He took a deep breath . This was foolish . He was a professional . She was a client . " Come in , " he said , carefully modulating both his manner and tone . " The clerk will see to the carpet when he arrives . I 'm David Knight . " He set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend his hand . He was determined that this woman would see him as he really was - a cool , cordial investigator , in control of himself . She did not immediately take his hand but instead studied his face . There was a question in her eyes . But whatever she wanted to know , she seemed hesitant to ask . When she finally stepped forward and slipped her hand into his , he was taken aback by the warmth and strength of her clasp . " I 'm Susan Carter . " Her name did n't ring a bell . Not that all of the firm 's clients were known to him . But he was surprised that no one had mentioned her over the dinner table the night before . His brothers seldom passed up an opportunity to talk about an attractive woman . Could she be a special client taken on by his mom or dad ? " Is something wrong , Mr. Knight ? " David realized that while silently asking himself these questions , he 'd been unconsciously gripping her hand . He released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he grabbed the telephone . Did n't matter whose client she was . What mattered was that he arrange for her to be taken care of so he could get on with what he had to do . " Who 's handling your case , Ms. Carter ? I 'll call and let them know you 're here . " " There 's no one to call . This is my first visit . " ( Continues ... )
