Teri Stewart had no idea that two of the secretaries she worked with were secretly trying to set up a date for her with a popular male escort . It was going to be expensive , but worth every penny . That did n't matter , though . The money was going to come from the company 's petty cash fund that the two secretaries controlled . <p> " John , if that woman does n't get some dick soon , we are all going to be in therapy , " complained one of the secretaries with a weary look on her face . <p> " And if this escort thing does n't work , I 'll screw her myself ! I 've been gay to the bone for my entire thirty-seven years and have never even seen a woman 's pussy , so you know this is serious , " moaned the terrified male secretary . " Either that or you 'll have to strap on one of those dildo dicks and do it . We ca n't take too much more of her foolishness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only agency that the two desperate secretaries could afford had only one black escort . And he had dates lined up for the next two months . When the agency suggested another one of their studs , a very dark-skinned Iraqi , the two secretaries considered him until they saw what he looked like . That poor man looked enough like bin Laden to be his twin . Teri was very patriotic . She 'd never sleep with a man who looked like the enemy . <p> " All we can do now is hope that the upcoming New Year will be better for Teri , " the female secretary said hopefully . " And better for us ... " <p> Teri had not been involved in an intimate relationship with a man in six months , and it was beginning to get on her last nerve . She had gradually become a tense , frustrated , abrupt Donna Karan-wearing bitch . She knew she was beginning to get on the last nerves of everybody she came in contact with . Just yesterday she actually saw the guy from the mailroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thundering down the hall trying to track down a fax she 'd misplaced . And the two nicest secretaries in the company had started looking at her in some of the strangest ways . She had no idea what was going through their heads , and she did n't want to know . <p> It was n't that no man was interested in her . That had never been the case and probably never would be . If for no other reason , men came on to her because of her looks . Most did n't care about anything else she had to offer . Few could resist her big , shiny brown eyes ; smooth mahogany complexion ; and full lips . Not to mention her hourglass-shaped body on legs that would put Tina Turner 's to shame and a mane of dark brown hair that did n't need a prop like a weave to cascade around her shoulders like a silk scarf . <p> It seemed like the older she got , the more men she attracted . She predicted that forty years from now she 'd be beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week somebody had stopped her on the street and asked if she was Kerry Washington , one of the most attractive black actresses in Hollywood . So why did her pussy feel like a condemned piece of property on noman's-land ? Beauty was not the cure-all for loneliness that some people thought it was . She was probably one of the best-looking lonely women on the planet . But in her case , it was by choice . And it was all because the right man had not approached her in six months . <p> " At least you still got your health and a good job , " somebody-she could n't even remember who-had told her a few days ago . That same person had advised her to contact an online dating service . An online dating service ! If that was n't the last refuge for the truly desperate and a paradise for predators of all kinds , she did n't know what was . She 'd made it emphatically clear that she was not that desperate ... yet . <p> " I 'm doing just fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always responded when some busybody 's nose sniffed in her direction and asked about her love life . <p> No , she was n't getting any and did n't know when she ever would again . What the hell . She could live with it . She still had more things to be thankful for than a lot of other people . Yes , she did still have her health and her job and had been thinking about getting a cat . <p> Right now her job was the main focus in her life . She enjoyed being the Executive Publicity Director for Eclectic Records . The prestige and all the perks that went along with her high-profile position meant as much to her as the fat paychecks she collected twice a month . This was one sister who did n't have to worry much about where she was going in the hectic business world and how she was going to get there ; she had already arrived . <p> Unfortunately , a lot of Teri 's peers hated their jobs , so they did n't share her vision or enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. who wanted to be at work on New Year 's Eve . It was hard enough for most people to come to work on the rest of the days in the year . But work was where Teri Stewart was tonight ( she 'd also worked well into the night on Christmas Eve , too ) . Not because she wanted to be , but because she had to be . <p> Teri did n't give a damn what everybody else in L.A. was doing . If nothing else , she was disciplined and considerate . To her , every commitment she made was important . Last year on a much-needed vacation to Puerto Vallarta , she had offered to take her friendly hotel maid and her kids to dinner . She did n't think to ask the woman how many kids she had , but she expected at least two . When the maid showed up with all nine of her kids in tow , including the eldest boy 's wife and their two kids , Teri did n't back out . Now here she was on New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late because one of her sources had dropped the ball . <p> The building that was home to Eclectic Records was almost empty . But that did n't bother Teri . There was a pit bull of a security guard at the front desk on the first floor at all times . The sixteen-story building was located on a busy street near downtown L.A. Even though there had been a few muggings in the area recently , it was still fairly safe compared to other parts of the city . <p> Holiday lights were still in place , inside and out . The soulful R. Kelly jam emanating from a CD player in the center of Teri 's cluttered desk in a corner office on the sixth floor did n't do a whole lot to make her feel more at ease . Her mood was dark , and she was more frustrated than usual . The impatient frown on her face and her pouting bottom lip , which would have made a less fortunate woman look like a hag , made her look even younger than her twenty-nine years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained information she needed to complete her report . " Shit ! " she hissed as she thumped the button on the speakerphone next to the CD player , speed-dialing her secretary at home . <p> " Nicole , you did n't put a copy of Reverend Bullard 's report on my desk , " she insisted , glaring at the telephone as if it were the source of her frustration . There was no answer . " Nicole , are you there ? " <p> " Uh-huh , I 'm here , " Nicole finally replied with a mighty hiccup . Somebody had popped open a bottle of champagne in the company break room to jump-start the New Year 's Eve festivities . Like a fish with a long swallow , Nicole had guzzled two glasses before she left the office two hours ago . <p> By the time Teri had concluded a tense conference call with two long-winded clients on the East Coast and made it to the break room , all the champagne was gone . If she ever needed a liquid crutch , it was now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for it in a couple of hours . <p> " I thought I told you to put a copy of the Bullard report on my desk . You know we ca n't afford to not get our artists mentioned in the tabloids and the music rags whenever they do something good . " Teri was convinced that a story about an ex-con preacher making gospel CDs for troubled teenagers would be good press for the preacher and for Eclectic Records . " I thought I told you twice . " <p> " Well , I thought I did , " Nicole said with a burp . " I meant to ... " <p> " You thought you did and you meant to , but you did n't , " Teri snapped . <p> " Will you please calm down ? You 're making me nervous . " <p> " Calm down , my ass . I 've got a job to do and I ca n't do mine if you do n't do yours . " Teri paused and let out a loud breath . " I 'm sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrations on you . I just want to finish what I started and get the hell up out of this place . " Teri let out another loud breath , inspected her silk-wrapped nails , and glanced around the spacious office that she spent as much time in as she did her condo near Hollywood . <p> " That 's better , " Nicole mouthed . <p> Nicole Mason sat on the edge of her bed in the apartment she shared with her son . With a heavy sigh , she rose and wiggled her plump but firm ass into a pair of black lace panties . " Try the file cabinet behind my desk . The report should be in the top drawer in a green folder , " she said . The panties felt a little too tight , just like almost everything else she owned . Especially the black slip she had on now . She made a mental note to curtail her ongoing relationships with Roscoe 's House of Chicken ' n Waffles , Popeye 's , Marie Callender , and Sara Lee or else she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Teri , you know you are my girl , so I know you wo n't take this the wrong way ... " <p> Teri responded with an exasperated snort . <p> " Girlfriend , you need to get a life , " Nicole told her . " You know it and I know it . Everybody else knows it , too . " <p> " I have a life , thank you . I am on my grind , " Teri reported , as she continued her search . She entered Nicole 's work area , which was right outside her office . She fought her way through an assortment of large , live green plants on the floor that decorated the area like a rain forest . She found the green folder right where Nicole said it would be . With another frown , she returned to her office with the folder and leaned over her desk , glaring at the phone . She sucked in her breath so hard her chest ached , but before she could speak again Nicole 's voice cut into her muddled thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be hanging out tonight . Come on , this is New Year 's Eve and we happen to be in one of the most exciting cities on this planet . And , in case you forgot , Lincoln freed the slaves . " <p> " I have a job to do , Nicole , " Teri reminded her . <p> " We all do . But we all have lives outside of our jobs , too , " Nicole said firmly . <p> " I know , I know . I just need to tweak a few more sentences on this damn report . It wo n't take that long . And why are you rushing me ? You are not even dressed yet . " <p> " How would you know that ? " Nicole quipped , tugging on the waistband of her panties . <p> " Because I know you , " Teri remarked . Flipping through the green folder , her eyes got big and a smile formed on her lips . " I found it ! " she exclaimed , clutching the missing document to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe . She breathed a sigh of relief and flopped down into her chair , which was so comfortable with its soft black leather and adjustable seat that she did n't want to move again . " Let the games begin ! " <p> Nicole rose and stood by the side of her bed , which was just as cluttered as the rest of the bedroom . She ignored the clothing and music magazines that she had tossed to the foot of her bed . " Uh-huh . So , now you can- " She was cut off by the annoying buzz of a dial tone . " Hang up on me then , bitch . " She laughed , shaking her head . " I 'm too scared of you . " <p> Chapter Two As soon as Nicole hung up the telephone , she rolled her large , inky black eyes and let out a deep breath . Then she raked her fingers through her thick , shoulder-length , charcoal black hair-a weave that only her hairdresser knew about . <p> She would never admit that she wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade and texture as her real hair ? All pure black women were n't as bald-headed or hair and scalp challenged as some people implied . Half of her female cousins had thick hair halfway down their backs and it was n't because of an Indian ancestor or the result of a fling with an Irishman or whatnot . <p> Before her weave-wearing days , she 'd possessed a beautiful head of hair . Now she had more bald spots on her head than a dried-out cornfield . She blamed the permanent hair loss on the stress of once being married to a violent asshole . The hair that the stress did n't destroy had been pulled out in clumps by the violent asshole during some of their many battles . But she 'd survived somewhat intact . At least physically . But like a lot of abused women , she wore her scars on the inside . Now , thanks to the hair that had once belonged to some female in Ethiopia , she still looked good . She lifted a hand mirror and gazed at her reflection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , mimicking Paris Hilton . <p> But she was n't a Paris Hilton ; she had to work for a living . She had to work in an office and deal with workaholics like Teri Stewart five days a week-then get calls from her after she got home . <p> " Yes , Miss Whip Cracking Thing , you can call my house after hours and you can hang up on me . I do n't mind . Just keep signing my paychecks and giving me my bonuses on time , " she said , now glaring at the telephone she had just hung up . <p> And she did n't mind . Nicole loved her job and she loved Teri , which was why she had canceled a date so she could accompany Teri to another party that Teri did n't want to go to on her own . <p> Nicole made a mental note to cancel her part in a scheme with another secretary to set Teri up with a paid male escort . She knew for a fact that that dude was a firecracker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out with him during a dating slump she 'd slid into last year . She laughed and shook her head . If the other secretary still wanted to pay somebody to fuck Teri , he 'd do it without her assistance . She had decided that her relationship with Teri was too important to risk . <p> A loud , sour belch rose in Nicole 's throat , then popped out of her mouth , almost making her gag . She was still feeling the effects of the champagne she had consumed . The cup of coffee she 'd picked up from Starbucks on the way home , hoping it would help reduce her buzz , had n't helped . She was as dizzy now as she 'd been before she left work . But that did n't matter one way or the other . It was party time and she was going to party her big ass off tonight . <p> The panties she 'd just slid into seemed even tighter now as she patted her stomach . The elastic in the waistband was stretched so tight she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation to know that the bloating around her middle was mostly premenstrual water retention that would last only a few hours . <p> Standing in the middle of her bedroom floor with her hands on her hips , she looked around her cluttered bedroom . She did n't have much , but she was thankful for what she did have . Aside from her family and a few close friends , at the top of her list was a job she loved . It was demanding and it did n't pay as much as she would have liked , but it was a job , and she worked with people she admired and respected . <p> Living in L.A. and working in the music industry , she was surrounded by wealth and a fast-paced lifestyle that she admired from the sidelines and secretly envied . Who would n't ? She dealt with people who paid more for one pair of shoes than she paid for rent . She 'd met and socialized with some of the biggest recording stars in the business . Last year , she 'd been treated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapper . And even though it had been part of her reward for taking the rapper 's dog to the vet , she had enjoyed it . <p> Despite the fact that the rapper in question was a first-class fool , she 'd been attracted to him and they 'd spent the night together in his Hollywood Hills mansion . He had admired her good looks and spunk . He had made a bunch of promises-ones she knew he would n't keep-while he was on top of her , his dick slapping the side of her thigh as if it were his favorite sport . <p> A week later , when he was supposed to call her again and did n't , she saw him on an entertainment TV show grinning into the camera as he exited a church with the supermodel he 'd just married . The last time she saw him was six months after his wedding . He was strutting his newly divorced ass down a street in West Hollywood . He 'd flirted with her again , not even realizing he 'd already sampled her fruit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool twice . Karrine Steffans , the ultimate black groupie , had already cornered that market and then told the world about it in her two tell-all best-selling books . ( Continues ... ) <p>
