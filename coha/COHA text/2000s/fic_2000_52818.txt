ContentsA Word from the Editor # You know , there is this amazing thing that happens when you begin to create a common history with someone . Each detail is fascinating . You could just go to a mall and hang near the fountain in the atrium , and you 'll find yourself going over that time as if it were the Zapruder film . <p>  --  Mark Leyner A Word from the Editor Last month 's issue of Mondo Zapruder sparked a flurry of correspondence among our subscribers ( see below ) . When I started this project over a year ago , it was my hope to stimulate just this kind of earnest and impassioned discussion . <p> Our latest issue brings regular readers a twofold treat . First , I am proud to announce that , as soon as sufficient funding is arranged , Mondo Zapruder is going online . Our venture into electronic media will greatly expand the print audience that has loyally followed our progress during the last year . Subscribers will soon be able to download frame-by-frame recreations of crucial scenes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have saved my most exciting announcement for last : This month 's Postmortem feature at last uncovers the long-sought Smoking Gun . Readers may view this announcement with skepticism , since I have trumpeted achieving this discovery in every issue since MZ #1 . But , as will be seen , the evidence contained here is overwhelming . <p> My discovery should not be taken as a sign that this publication has run its course . If anything , it will take significant additional research and analysis to explore the ramifications of what we have learned . Finding the Smoking Gun is only the beginning . Readers can look forward to many more issues packed with the unique brand of provocative editorial content they have come to expect from Mondo Zapruder . <p> Letters to the Editor <p> Dear Sir , <p> Please do not leave any more copies of your publication in my newsstand section . As I have told you several times already , I am not interested in selling it . I have been patient with you so far , but if you disregard this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your business elsewhere . <p> Salvador **25;1216;TOOLONG Discount Liquor The Editor responds : Some readers may question the wisdom of printing such unfavorable correspondence in these pages . And yet I see Mr. Montenegro 's resistance as an encouraging sign that free speech is alive and well in this country . Some people are not ready for the truths revealed in Mondo Zapruder ( offered at the low , low price of $1.00 per issue , no less ! ) . So be it . They are free to go elsewhere for the facts . I , meanwhile , am free to circulate my ideas among those more open-minded individuals who are ready for them . <p> Son , <p> Why must you waste your gift on what can only be called perversions ? Do n't you remember what the guidance counselor told us so long ago , how cinematic memory was extremely rare and yet to be fully understood ? You had so much promise , so much potential for helping others . Remember Mrs. Halversen 's class ? You would do the most beautiful , letter-perfect recitations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears every time . She had never seen such an articulate fifth-grader . <p> What about in high school when you caught the vice principal molesting the Ferguson girl ? You were the only person at the Homecoming dance who could remember seeing him drag her under the bleachers . The superintendent was so grateful for your testimony at the trial that he made you Good Citizen of the Year . <p> Now it 's come to this ? Publishing the intimate details of your life ? For what purpose ? Have you even bothered calling Dr. Kotzlowe ? He is an expert on bereavement . I know he was a great source of strength for me after your father passed away . That was hard . What you are going through is nothing by comparison . Let it go . <p> And do n't expect my help in getting your filth broadcast online . <p> Your mother The Editor responds : It was " Prufrock , " not " The Wasteland , " and everyone was bored . <p> I was a witness for the prosecution because no one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose and many ways to mourn . <p> Asshole , <p> Thanks for the latest issue . I was particularly amused by the skull and candy hearts that came with it . My lawyer , however , was not . Restraining orders exist for a reason . <p> I 'm not the one with the cinematic memory , but your recreation of the last time we made love ( " Postmortem , " p. 5 ) contains several exaggerations and inaccuracies . I have never worn or owned underwear even remotely resembling what you have me wearing in panels 7 through 15 . Also , I do n't remember glowing so much after we finished . Panel 22 makes me look like a saint in a stained glass window . <p> Give it up . There is no Smoking Gun . People drift apart . There does n't need to be a reason . <p> You know who The Editor responds : Loyal readers of Mondo Zapruder will recognize the pungent prose stylings of my ex-girlfriend . For legal reasons , I can not use her real name anywhere in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were put off by previously used pseudonyms . After much thought , I eventually decided to refer to her simply by her first initial , B. <p> I am accused in B. 's letter of engaging in a fruitless , tiresome quest . But it is you , B. , who are tiresome , with your legal maneuvering , your disingenuous denials , your stubborn refusal to see the truth . There are always reasons . Some of us are more determined to find them than others . <p> Of course , there is no better way to rebut the skeptics than to proceed to this month 's feature article <p> Postmortem : The Smoking Gun <p> Background <p> For most of the last year , I have focused on frames recollected from the Xavier Affair , a party hosted by David Xavier , one of B. 's colleagues from work . Readers will recall that this event appeared to be the watershed in my relationship with B. Her behavior that night was erratic , warm and jovial one moment , cool and distant the next . Though she rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , she consumed two vodka martinis and one gin and tonic . A second gin and tonic was only half consumed when she decided that she wanted to leave . <p> On the way out , I asked her if something was wrong . She said it was nothing , maybe stress from work . As we approached her building , she loosened her grip on my right hand and began stroking my fingers in a quasi-clockwise fashion , a signal indicating that she wanted me to spend the night . This would be the last time we slept together . <p> Analysis of that night ran in our Valentine 's Day double issue and revealed no new clues to the Smoking Gun , although it did bring to light several details of B. 's growing discontent . Afterwards , she turned away from me and slept the rest of the night on her left side . She usually preferred her right side , facing me , with her head resting on my upper arm at a roughly twenty-degree angle . <p> B. also kicked me in her sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In bed , B. would typically weave her legs together with mine in such a way that , on waking , I would feel neither numbness nor discomfort . <p> These days I sleep on the floor . <p> The Single Bullshit Theory <p> The following day , B. left a message on my answering machine in which she relayed her doubts about our future together . Repeated playing of the machine 's microcassette indicated that the message was authentic . <p> In subsequent conversations , B. attempted to rationalize her decision to break things off . Two days after her initial message , she relayed , by phone , the substance of her so-called explanation . A complete transcript and analysis of this phone call appeared in Mondo Zapruder #1 . A partial transcript is reprinted here : <p> B. : It 's not about you or anything you did or did n't do . Mondo Zapruder : Then what is it about ? <p> B : I do n't know . It 's about change . It 's about needing more than someone who needs you . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed you ? <p> B : No ... not always . But now  --  What was that ? <p> MZ : What ? <p> B : That noise . That clicking . <p> MZ : I did n't hear anything . <p> B : Are you recording this ? <p> My analysis of this exchange concluded that B. 's explanation was essentially bogus ( see " Postmortem : The Single Bullshit Theory , " MZ #1 ) . By throwing around meaningless terms from popular psychology such as " needs , " " change , " and " growth , " she was clearly trying to deflect scrutiny away from the central question . <p> Later , in person , I reminded B. of the serious consequences that would result if she was withholding evidence from my investigation . On hearing this , she became noticeably agitated , threatened to retain legal counsel , and abruptly cut off all communications . <p> Suspected Rivals Revisited <p> Undaunted , I began sorting through the available evidence . I did not do so naively . There are countless possible reasons behind the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search early on to the most likely reason for B. 's decision . The Romantic Rival Scenario quickly emerged as the best place to start . <p> The Romantic Rival Scenario was suggested in the first issue of Mondo Zapruder and remains the central focus of this investigation . ( The Temporary Insanity Scenario and the Demonic Possession Scenario were proposed in MZ #5 , but this was merely an editorial lark fueled by spring fever and cheap wine . ) Simply put , I theorized that B. left to be with someone else . B. has repeatedly denied this allegation , and , to be fair , the evidence is inconclusive . However , there is much circumstantial evidence linking her to David Xavier . This evidence has already been discussed in a special three-part series ( " Postmortem : Suspected Rivals , " MZ #2-4 ) . <p> For various reasons , B. 's connections to Xavier called for particularly close scrutiny . As one of her colleagues , he had daily access to her both at the office and after work . B. never tired of quoting whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . He had a vast repertoire of anecdotes from several different continents ( he was well-traveled ) and an equally vast list of books he recommended to friends ( he was well-read ) . Whenever I would object to how much she raved about Xavier , B. would accuse me of being jealous . Readers know , of course , that I was never jealous of Xavier . I merely wanted B. to talk about something else . <p> As previously documented , B. informed me one night , before retiring to bed , that we had been invited to a party at Xavier 's newly rented house . She watched for my reaction with an amused expression on her face . I looked up from the book I was reading and casually articulated my interest in finally meeting her esteemed coworker . <p> B. approached and stood next to where I lay reading . Promise me , she said , that you 'll be on your best behavior . I responded with an indifferent shrug . <p> She slid the slender band from around her ponytail and let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the bed and straddled my lap with her bare legs . I could feel the fringe of her cotton nightshirt brush the tops of my thighs . <p> Please , she whispered , close enough to be heard . <p> I did not refuse her request . <p> The Mysterious Second Gap <p> The Xavier Affair initially seemed the likeliest source of the Smoking Gun , since it immediately preceded B. 's phone message and its aftermath . The early stages of this inquiry uncovered two potentially significant anomalies . <p> First , B. wore lip gloss that night . She almost never used makeup . She did n't need to , and I had told her this as we stood in my bathroom getting ready . She said nothing , gave me a small smile , and began applying the gloss to her lips . For the rest of the night , I was distracted by the shimmery pink of her mouth and the soft fruit smell noticeable whenever she was nearby . <p> Second , I discovered a series of three time gaps in the Xavier frames . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereabouts could not be accounted for . The first gap ( G1 ) was fifteen minutes long ; the second ( G2 ) lasted twenty minutes ; the third and final gap ( G3 ) lasted twelve minutes . B. stated that at G1 and G3 , she was in line for the bathroom . Eyewitness accounts corroborate her explanation . But , curiously , G2 , the longest gap in the Xavier frames , has never been fully explained . When B. returned to the party , she said she had just stepped out for some air . However , this account has never been corroborated . In addition , David Xavier was reported missing from the party for a period of time that closely corresponds to the second gap . B. denied that there was any significance to this . Observations of Xavier 's movements that night revealed him to be gregarious , quite handsome , and a good seven inches taller than myself . But , except for a brief conversation that I witnessed on arriving , there is no visual record of B. and Xavier spending any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #6 , I reported the account of one witness who recalled seeing Xavier and B. share a marijuana cigarette on the steps of Xavier 's back porch . This witness later recanted his story , saying that he could no longer remember if it was B. or he himself who had shared the cigarette with the host . Analysis of B. 's appearance and behavior in the minutes following G2 was inconclusive in supporting the witness 's claims . She did not appear to be intoxicated . However , her apparent lucidity was marked by a subtle , yet noticeable air of guilty self-consciousness . When we spoke , she avoided direct eye contact and answered my questions with vague monosyllables . Repeated scrutiny of this evidence failed to definitively implicate Xavier or any other guest at the party . <p> The Crucial First Frame <p> Having run into a dead end with the Second Gap , I was at a loss for how to go forward . Eventually , I decided to set the Xavier Affair aside and work on other aspects of the search . These aspects involved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although this process delayed work on the Smoking Gun , it would eventually lead to my latest discovery . <p> One night , after proofreading articles for an upcoming issue , I went back to the Xavier frames . I had not considered them for months and did not know what I expected from still another viewing . Perhaps I thought that with fresh eyes , I would finally find something . <p> There has been little formal scientific study of cinematic recall , but I have determined that it is aided by the use of blank walls , of which there are several in my apartment . And so , as has been my custom for some time , I took my usual place on the floor , dimmed the lights , and waited for the first frame of my recollections to materialize on the wall 's bare plaster . <p> My viewing revealed nothing new . Except for the puzzle presented by the Second Gap , there was still no definitive clue to the origins of B. 's sudden change . After several hours , I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassingly personal reasons . Despite my disavowals in previous issues , B. could be quite beautiful , particularly in profile . The lighting in the opening frames of the Xavier Affair was especially conducive to appreciating this feature of B. 's appearance . I had focused so narrowly on her profile that I had never bothered to observe the actual expression on her face . Revisiting the first frame many months later , I saw how her eyes were lowered as we walked through the door , how her mouth strained to smile in greeting . I had discovered something crucial : B. had been upset from the moment we arrived . <p> How could I have missed something so obvious ? It was pointless to speculate . More important were the ramifications of this discovery . If the change in B. 's feelings was already occurring at the beginning of the Xavier Affair , it logically followed that the Smoking Gun could not have occurred there , but earlier in the Chronology . <p> The Restaurant , The Missing Foot <p> Eliminating Xavier 's party as the primary subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , it raised a confounding new question : Where else could the Smoking Gun be ? <p> Using a timeline compiled from earlier research , I worked backwards from the Xavier Affair , closely examining each moment spent with B. This was by no means a trivial exercise in nostalgia . I was searching for any anomalies in B. 's behavior , no matter how small , that would indicate the beginnings of her doubts about us . Isolating the critical moment in eight months of recollections would not be easy . Yet , perhaps inspired by recent progress , it did not take long for me to find my answer . <p> Two weeks and one day before B. 's phone call , we had dinner at The Biscuit Case , a popular downtown eatery . Nothing stood out about that night in my memory except for our high spirits . B. had just been promoted at work , and I had been hired to do security consulting for a local bank . <p> As readers well know , every relationship contains its share of habits and idiosyncrasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with B. For the analysis at hand , I would like to highlight one quirk in particular : B. 's sensitive feet . She was fond of slipping off her shoes and rubbing the soles of her feet against nearby surfaces . In restaurants and other public venues where tables allowed discretion , she would often wedge a foot into one of my trouser cuffs and stroke my ankle for extended periods of time . If she had to get up for any reason during these times , whether to use the restroom or check her voicemail , she would invariably , on returning , restore her foot to where it had been , smile , and ask , " Did you miss me ? " ( See " Postmortem : The Early Dates , " Mondo Zapruder #11 . ) <p> The latter detail is crucial as we revisit The Biscuit Case two weeks before the Xavier Affair and what followed . Approximately ten minutes after we sat down at our table , B. , as expected , slipped off a shoe and began probing the area under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ( see attached ) , this action is evident from the slight shift of B. 's body from left to right . Twenty seconds later , she found one of my ankles and proceeded as described above . This moment is indicated in Panel 3 by her sly smile and a slight narrowing of her eyes suggestive of pleasure . <p> After the salad course , B. claimed that she had to check her messages at the office . She removed her foot from where it had been , replaced her shoe , and said she would be right back . By counting the number of frames that elapsed while she was gone , I have calculated the length of her absence at 4.75 minutes . <p> Panels 4 through 14 represent a composite visualization of the ten seconds that elapsed after B. returned . As can be seen , she sits down , places her napkin in her lap , and ... nothing more . After fifteen seconds , it is I who must initiate conversation by asking her how things are at the office . Most significantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no movement under the table . In fact , for the rest of the night , she will keep her feet to herself . <p> Armed with this new evidence , I immediately called B. for comment . A transcript of my telephone interview follows : <p> Mondo Zapruder : It all started at The Biscuit Case , did n't it ? <p> B. : Who is this ? <p> MZ : You know who . <p> B. : You 've got to be kidding . It 's three o'clock in the morning . <p> MZ : Just admit that this all started after something that happened at The Biscuit Case . <p> B. : You 're pathetic . Hangs up . <p> I Am Not Pathetic <p> The Biscuit Case opened its doors in 1955 and has been a downtown favorite ever since . It specializes in classic American cuisine . I am quite partial to the meat loaf platter , followed by the apple pie a la mode . It is best known , of course , for its freshly baked biscuits , served as appetizers before every meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet highly significant to this inquiry . The restaurant 's cleanliness and , above all , its excellent lighting have helped to produce recollections of astonishing sharpness and clarity . The crucial frames from that evening show irrefutable evidence of the turning point I have long pursued . <p> The Smoking Gun <p> What follows is a reconstruction of events in the minute immediately following B. 's return to our table . For purposes of clarity , I have designated the first frame of the sequence as No. 0001 and the final frame as No. 1215 . Significant moments in this sequence are depicted in Illustration Panels 4 through 30 . <p> Frames 0001-0064 <p> B. sits down and returns her napkin to her lap . Frames 0065-0329 <p> The events of these fourteen seconds have already been described in part . At Frame 0128 , B. reaches for the basket of biscuits situated to her left and my right . She selects one and places it on a small white plate provided by our waiter . At 0320 , she replies with a terse " Fine " when I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike attaching too much significance to particular incidents and events . But few can ignore the striking moments between 0319 and 0322 . For , at nearly the exact instant that B. utters her terse reply , she slices the biscuit in half . Despite her attempts to dissemble through polite conversation , her actions reveal her true feelings all too clearly . <p> Frames 0330-0549 <p> B. takes a piece of biscuit , places it in her mouth , and begins to chew . She usually enjoys the appetizer course . In fact , she often fails to finish her entree because she has filled up on appetizers . ( For more on B. 's eating habits , see " B. 's Favorite Foods , " MZ #16 . ) <p> Tonight , however , is different . She chews mechanically and swallows quickly , as if to get it over with ( 0440 ) . She says nothing as she takes another piece of biscuit from her plate . <p> Frames 0550-0587 <p> I ask B. if she is all right . She has been silent now for thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lower left . My fingers aim for B. 's right hand , which clenches across from me in a pearly fist . I hesitate and wait for her to notice . <p> Frames 0588-0624 <p> B. looks at me for the first time since her return to the table and asks , Why do you always have to know everything ? <p> Frames 0625-0918 <p> The waiter interrupts us . I order my usual . B. is having the chicken salad on pita bread . When she is asked if she wants anything more , she says no , thank you . B. looks up and smiles at the waiter . <p> Frames 0919-1011 <p> I stare at B. , who is still staring at the waiter . I begin to explain myself . You look upset , I say . You were on the phone for a while , and I was worried that something had happened . <p> Frames 1012-1030 <p> You turn back and look down at the table . You do not touch your food . <p> Frames 1031-1214 <p> The blankness of your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Frame 1215 <p> You open your mouth to speak . <p> The Beginning <p> We have now seen the beginning of the end . But what began the beginning ? Was it something as simple as seeing an attractive waiter ? Did he remind B. of something she saw lacking in her own life ? <p> Did it start while she was away ? Was it something she heard while on the phone ? Did she even use the phone that night , or was that just an excuse she used to be alone ? <p> There are witnesses , dozens of them , that I must interview . The restaurant staff could provide important additional information . The restaurant 's patrons also should not be overlooked . The images from that night are sharp enough so that at least some of the other diners can be tracked down . Despite the efforts of a few naysayers , this inquiry is far from over . <p> Conclusion <p> Do n't tell me there is no Smoking Gun . It is real , as real as these walls , this floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bodies . <p> I will continue my search . I will not be intimidated . There will always be new theories , new angles , new haystacks in which to dig for the needles in your words and movements . <p> And there will be time . As a great poet once said , There will be time , there will be time . Is n't that what you meant in the restaurant that night ? Is n't that what you meant when you turned back , smiled , but not at me , and said that life is never fast enough at eighteen frames per second ? <p> <p> By Pedro Ponce <p>
