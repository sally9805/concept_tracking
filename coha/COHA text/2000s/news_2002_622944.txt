<p> Sitting on the sofa in the living room . Lying in bed on a lazy Sunday morning . Even strolling through the garden out back . <p> With my new Wi-Fi home network , I can now surf the Internet at broadband speed  --  which is dozens of times faster than dial-up  --  no matter where I am in my flat . <p> I 'm not alone . Millions of Americans are setting up home networks , many of them using Wi-Fi  --  a wireless technology officially known as 802.11b . One of the main reasons is to share a high-speed Internet connection , like DSL or cable modem , with multiple computers . Being able to roam anywhere in the house is an extra perk . <p> Today , roughly 1 million homes have wireless networks . That will likely grow to close to 8 million by late 2006 , predicts Parks Research , a Dallas market research firm . " Home wireless networks are going to become really common , " said Schelley Olhava , a home networking analyst with IDC , a technology research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SBC Communications , for instance , started selling a wireless kit made by San Jose 's 2Wire for $600 in the summer of 2001 . It has since slashed the regular price to $450 and is currently hawking the kit for $199 . Bargain-hunters can find even cheaper deals online . <p> But setting up a Wi-Fi network is still full of pitfalls for the novice user . Indeed , even veteran computer users often need to spend minutes  --  or hours  --  on the phone with tech support to work out an array of minor bugs . <p> I should know . In the past few weeks , I tried setting up computer networks from five different vendors : Belkin , D-Link , Microsoft , NetGear and 2Wire . None went flawlessly . And I gave up on one network completely . ( I also requested a system from Linksys , but never received one . ) <p> D-LINK , NETGEAR <p> Granted , the first network I set up was on the cheap . <p> Instead of buying a kit at a store , I scrounged around and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I just needed two things : First , a wireless base station ( also called a wireless gateway or router ) to physically plug into my PC and DSL modem , and then beam the wireless signal to the rest of my home . Second , a Wi-Fi network card to let my laptop pick up the signal . <p> In this case , I bought a D-Link 714 Wireless Gateway for $80 and a NetGear MA 401 network card for $50 . Even with shipping , the total came to just over $150 . Not bad , I thought . <p> But I immediately ran into trouble . My desktop computer and the base station  --  linked by a physical cable  --  could n't communicate . All the lights on the base station were blinking , but it did n't register on my PC . <p> D-Link tech support was n't much help . A technician in Southern California asked me to just reset the base station and turn my computer off and on . Again . And again . Seven times . <p> Finally , I gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came with the base station . That did the trick . ( Computer stores sell Ethernet cables for about $10-$15 . ) <p> Setting up the rest of the network was a breeze but with one minor annoyance : <p> Although the D-Link base station and NetGear card are both supported to comply with Wi-Fi standards , the two could n't seem to understand each other when I turned on the base station 's encryption feature , which is supposed to scramble the wireless signal to keep nosy neighbors from tapping into your network . It worked a little too well . It also shut out my notebook , no matter how much I tinkered to match the codes . <p> Yet because the pieces are made by different manufacturers I was n't sure whom to blame . ( It was n't until later that I confirmed that the problem was with the base station , which was recently discontinued . ) <p> The NetGear card ( list price : $79 ) worked fine , for instance , with the NetGear MR814 Wireless Router ( $181 ) . Setting up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reinstalled the card , I ran into one minor problem . The software did n't install automatically on my notebook . And the manual pointed me to a name and directory for the setup file that did n't exist . ( After leafing through folders on the CD-ROM , I eventually figured out the right files to copy onto my hard drive . ) <p> MICROSOFT <p> Another set of Wi-Fi gear from Microsoft promised to sidestep some complicated codes and automatically take care of the settings . <p> " The process of setting up a wireless network has simply been too complex , " said Lisa Brummel , corporate vice president for the Microsoft Home Products Division , which launched its new Broadband Wireless line in September . The wireless notebook kit I received lists for $220 . <p> Yet try as I might , I could n't get the easy-to-use software to work . Instead , I just got an annoying error message warning me that the computer could n't detect an Internet connection  --  even as I surfed the Web and checked my e-mail in different windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but gave up after waiting on hold for 20 minutes . <p> OK , call me impatient . But I had plenty of other kits to try . And I 'd already heard other horror stories . <p> My colleague , tech columnist Henry Norr , no slouch when it comes to installing home networks , managed to get the kit running only after spending two hours on the phone with Microsoft 's tech support . An industry researcher I talked to gave up trying to install it after a week . <p> Of course , I still suspect Microsoft is just punishing me for never upgrading from Windows 98 . <p> 2WIRE <p> I ran into a different snafu with 2Wire 's HomePortal wireless home networking kit , which is being sold via SBC , the largest provider of high-speed Internet service in the Bay Area . <p> Setting up the base station was a snap , especially since the software and manuals were set up with SBC DSL subscribers in mind ( so it was able to provide more guidance for my specific Internet service provider ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The software did n't install automatically , and I could n't quickly find the setup file on my own . <p> But when I called the tech support number listed for SBC customers , a technician named Fernando said he could n't help . " We do n't support networking at all , " he said . <p> " But SBC sent me the kit , " I protested . " And the manual specifically told me to call this number for support . " <p> Fernando was unmoved . " We 're not going to support it , " he told me coldly . " 2Wire just asked us to sell it for them . " <p> I got a much warmer response when I called the number recommended for non-SBC customers , which directed me to 2Wire 's call center in Phoenix . A 2Wire technician pointed me to the right file on the CD-ROM and told me what encryption codes to type in . It took just a few minutes . <p> BELKIN <p> The last kit I tried was made by Belkin . As in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took minutes . ( I did n't even need to use the CD-ROM provided ; I adjusted all the settings using the browser . ) <p> But for whatever reason , the card did n't work on my notebook , even after installing the software twice . <p> Belkin 's recommendation ? Just download another version of the software ( called drivers ) via the Internet . <p> This could , of course , be a hitch considering the network card was n't working  --  meaning my laptop could n't access the Internet through the wireless network . <p> Fortunately , though , I happened to have three other network cards on hand . ( Does n't everyone ? ) And the Belkin base station worked just fine with the NetGear notebook card . <p> Once I downloaded the software , the Belkin card worked smoothly . <p> The verdict : I 'd give a tepid thumbs-up to all the kits except for Microsoft . After all , they wound up doing the one thing I asked : Allowed me to share my Internet connection throughout my two-bedroom apartment despite walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are looking for some other particular features , I 'd give the nod to Santa Clara 's NetGear . <p> The signal strength was slightly stronger than Belkin 's when I took the laptop for a stroll down the street from my apartment . <p> And it 's one of the cheapest options available . You can find both the base station and network card online for as little as $130 . <p> You 'll likely need the savings for long-distance calls to tech support . Or to buy a tech-savvy friend dinner in exchange for help . <p> E-mail Todd Wallack at **42;595;TOOLONG
