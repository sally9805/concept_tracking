Victims of the debilitating disease , which is more prevalent among Black women , tell how to manage the life-altering illness Photograph Practicing yoga has helped Juliette Moore , who was diagnosed with lupus 16 years ago , relieve stress and cope with her disease . Though hers is not the most severe form of lupus , she says she must still be careful to get plenty of rest and reduce the prospect of " flares " - episodes in which crippling lupus symptoms arise . // FOR 36-year-old Juliette Moore , the past 16 years have been a journey to heightened physical and emotional awareness . That journey , however , has also been a physical and emotional roller-coaster ride as Moore learned to live with and combat the effects of lupus , the devastating autoimmune connective tissue disease that disproportionately strikes African-American women . Since she was diagnosed with the disease as a 20-year-old college student , Moore , a consultant with a training and development firm in Columbus , Ohio , has learned to stave off the assorted and sometimes debilitating symptoms of lupus , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often associated with the disease . She has become more attuned to her body and the warning signs of incipient " flares " - the episodes in which the many symptoms of lupus become more prevalent . More importantly , she has learned that the effects of the disease , once considered a slow , painful march to early death , can be diminished by paying attention to your body and taking a proactive role in your treatment . " Lupus has certainly affected my life , especially my working life , " says Moore , who maintains a four-day workweek in order to prevent fatigue . " But if you have the form of lupus that I have , it certainly is not a death sentence . It can be managed . You just have to listen to your body and try to take care of and control of your life . " Approximately 400,000 Americans suffer from lupus , with Black women making up 32 percent of the victims . Lupus , in fact , is four times more likely to strike AfricanAmericans than Whites . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosis and treatment of lupus , still the disease remains something of a mystery . Its cause is unknown . Though most researchers believe that genetics is the chief indicator ( the disease tends to run in families ) , some suspect that environmental factors may also play a part . The symptoms of lupus are varied and mutable , contributing not only to the shroud of mystery surrounding the disease , but to the agony of living with it as well . Lupus can affect the skin and kidneys , blood vessels and joints , the nervous system , heart and other internal organs . While lupus sufferers are generally young women of childbearing years , the disease often , leaves them chronically fatigued-their lung capacity severely diminished-their joints stiffened with various forms of arthritis . They may experience hair loss , anemia , ulcers in the mouth or kidney sediment .

Cherry also searches the Internet for information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be as mild as just a bit of arthritis , or severe enough to land patients in the intensive care unit with sudden fluid building in the lungs or collecting around the heart , " says Dr. Keith Gilmer , a a board-certified rheumatologist in Rockford , Ill. , who treats many lupus patients . " Despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment , lupus can still be a significant and devastating problem . And it seems to be even more devastating in African-Americans , who are more susceptible to the complications of lupus such as the effects of hypertension . " Among the most trying and difficult times for many lupus sufferers are the months and often years leading to an initial diagnosis . Because the disease can affect so many organs and mirror so many other maladies , general practitioners , who may not see many lupus patients , sometimes fail to recognize its symptoms . As a result , some lupus patients suffer through a long odyssey of treatment before the disease is ever accurately diagnosed . Such was the case with Halline Cherry , a 40-yearold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything from migraine headaches to thyroid disease before her lupus was diagnosed in 1998 . The fast and frequent changes in her condition made her question her mental as well as physical health . " With lupus , things change so quickly . I would call the doctor and say this is what 's going on with me , and by the time I got there , that was not the problem anymore , " she recalls . " And so you begin to wonder , Am I really sick ? What on earth is wrong with me ? ' It 's unnerving . " Getting an accurate diagnosis , however , is just the first step in the campaign to learn to live with lupus . The next step is understanding the disease and its treatment . Currently , patients with mild to moderate forms of lupus are treated with a daily cocktail of medicines-in some cases as many as 15 pills a day-that may include one of several forms of antimalarial drugs and steroids . But many longtime lupus patients caution against swallowing everything your doctor may prescribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether other drugs with lesser side effects might be equally effective in your course of treatment . " You have to learn to be your own health advocate , " says Juliette Moore . " You ca n't be afraid to ask questions or even disagree with your doctor if you think the side effects of the medicine are not quite worth it . " Halline Cherry regularly searches the Internet for information about the latest developments in lupus treatment and conducts online chats with other lupus sufferers about the side effects of certain medications . " We share information about how the medicine has affected us and what other medicines may be good alternatives , " she says . " It 's like my support group . " Both Cherry and Moore have sisters who also are lupus sufferers , and those relationships , too , have been a source of support and information . But the most important thing any lupus patient can do , say those who continue to battle the disease , is to get in touch with his or her own body . Most recommend keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debilitating episodes . The log also will enable you to communicate better with doctors , who will want to know when the episodes occurred and the extent of their seriousness . Because stress and fatigue can trigger flares and exacerbate the most harmful symptoms of the disease , managing lupus is a matter of achieving balance and knowing when to slow down and calm down . " What I tell people now is that lupus serves as my conscience , " says Juliette Moore . " It makes me tell the truth and ask it of others because I ca n't stand the stress of lies . It 's made me a more spiritual kind of person , not in a deeply religious sense , but I 've found a sort of centeredness that helps me release tension . And that makes me feel better . " Still , there 's no mistaking that lupus changes lives . " I 've had to alter my lifestyle quite a bit , " says Halline Cherry , who has gone from working three jobs at one point to now only working two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss out on some of the activities of her two daughters , age 9 and 15 . " I used to be a very active person , " she says , " but with lupus I ca n't allow myself to get tired or I spiral downward very quickly . So I have to plan very carefully on a dayto-day basis what I 'm going to do . " On the positive side , however , early detection and treatment advances have improved the quality of life as well as the life expectancy for many lupus patients . " With improvements in our ability to treat some of the lifelimiting complications of lupuskidney failure in particular-we have dramatically improved the life expectancy of these patients , " says Dr. Gilmer . " While we ca n't lose sight of the fact that this is still a devastating disease , we know that in the hands of the right doctor-who works in concert with the proper specialists-and with management of their diet and their stress factors , lupus patients can do very well .
