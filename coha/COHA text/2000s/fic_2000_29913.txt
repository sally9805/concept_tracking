ONE Marburg an der Lahn , Germany 8 November 1942 On the night of November 7 , Obersturmfhrer-SS-SD Wilhelm Peis , a tall , pale , blond man of twenty-eight , who was the senior Sicherheitsdienst ( SS Security Service ) officer in Marburg an der Lahn , received the following message by Teletype from Berlin : YOU WILL PLEASE TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF REICHSMINISTER ALBERT SPEER AND A PERSONAL STAFF OF FOUR WHO WILL MAKE AN UNPUBLICIZED VISIT TO THE FULMAR ELEKTRISCHES WERK AT MARBURG 8 NOVEMBER . THE REICHSMINISTER WILL ARRIVE BY PRIVATE TRAIN AT 10:15 AND DEPART IN THE SAME MANNER AT APPROXIMATELY 15:45 . The message from Berlin seemed more or less routine to Peis , and he at first treated it as such until early in the morning of the eighth when Gauleiter Karl-Heinz Schroederin a state somewhere between chagrin and panicburst into Peis 's sleeping quarters ( Peis was not in fact asleep ) and pointedly reminded him that not only had Speer taken the place of Dr. Fritz Todt as head of the Todt Organizationin charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most powerful men in Germany , but that he was a personal friend , perhaps the closest personal friendof the Fhrer himself . The intensity of Schroeder 's concern impelled Peis to double his efforts on behalf of welcoming the Reichsminister , and he rounded up half a dozen Mercedes , Horch , and Opel Admiral automobiles to carry Speer from therailroad station to the Fulmar Electric Plantor wherever else he might wish to go . He canceled all leave for the police and the SD . And he dressed in a new uniform . By this time Peis was less motivated by the concerns of the Gauleiter than by more pressing and personal concerns of his own : The Reichsminister would certainly be accompanied by a senior SS officerat least an Obersturmbannfhrer ( Lieutenant Colonel ) and possibly even an Oberfhrer ( Senior Colonel ) . If this officer found fault with his security arrangements for Reichsminister Speer , Peis could start packing his bags with his warmest clothes . There was always a shortage of Obersturmfhrers on the Eastern Front , and a long list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the SS-SD detachment in Marburg an der Lahn . Peis had long before decided that it was far better to be a big fish in a little pond than the other way around . Peis set up his security arrangements at about seven in the morning , soon after Schroeder had left him ; he personally checked his arrangements twice ; and he was at the Hauptbahnhof forty-five minutes before the scheduled arrival of the private train . The train itself , though it rolled into the station on schedule to the minute , was otherwise a disappointment . To start with , it was n't actually a train . It was one car , self-propellednot much more than a streetcar . And there were no senior SS officers to be impressed with the way Peis had handled his responsibilities . Only Reichsminister Speer and three othersall civilians , one a womanstepped out of the car . And even Speer himself was n't in uniform . He was wearing a business suit and looked like any other civilian . After the Reichsminister and his party reached the platform , Karl-Heinz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave a stiff-armed Nazi salute , then launched into his welcoming speech . Speer made a vague gesture with his hand in reply to the salute and cut Schroeder off at about word five . " Very good of you to say so , Herr Gauleiter , " Speer said , and then went quickly on . " I had hoped that Professor Dyer would be able to meet us . " From the look on Schroeder 's face , it was obvious to Peis that Schroeder had never heard of Professor Dyer . Peis had . Unless there were two Professor Dyers , which was highly unlikely , Reichsminister Speer desired the company of a man who had one foot in a Konzentrationslager ( concentration camp ) and the other on a banana peel . " Forgive me , Herr Reichsminister , " Schroeder said . " Professor Dyer ? " And then , Peis thought , Schroeder finally put his brain in gear . " Perhaps Obersturmfhrer Peis can help you . Peis ! " Peis marched over and saluted . Speer smiled at Peis . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . " I sent it , Herr Speer , " the woman said . Speer nodded . " requesting Professor Friedrich Dyer to meet with me . " " I have received no such message , Herr Reichsminister , " Peis said . " But I think I know where he can be found . " " And could you bring him ? " Speer asked . " If I may be so bold as to suggest , Herr Reichsminister ? " Peis said . " Of course , " Speer replied . " While you and your party accompany the Gauleiter , I 'll see if I can find Professor Dyer for you and take him to the Fulmar plant . " " Good man ! " Speer smiled and clutched Peis 's arm . " It 's quite important . I ca n't imagine what happened to the telegram . " " I 'll do my best , Herr Reichsminister , " Peis said . Peis hurried to the stationmaster 's office and grabbed the telephone . He dialed the number from memory . Gisella Dyer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making gravel from boulders in a KZ somewhere ) , answered the phone on the third ring . " How are you , Gisella ? " Peis asked . " Very well , thank you , Herr Sturmbannfhrer , " she said , warily . Peis understood her lack of enthusiasm . But she was n't the reason for his call today . " Do you know where I can find your father ? " he asked . He heard her suck in her breath , and it was a moment before she spoke again . She was carefully considering her reply . Peis knew that she would have preferred that Peis direct his attentions toward her not because she liked him ( she despised him ) , but because as long as Peis liked her , her father stayed out of the KZ . " He 's at the university , " she said finally , with a slight tremor in her voice . " Is there something wrong , Herr Sturmbannfhrer ? " " Where exactly at the university ? " Gisella Dyer considered that , too , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " He does n't have another class until four this afternoon . " She paused , then asked again , " Is there something wrong ? " " Official business , Gisella , " Peis said , and hung up . It would be useful for Gisella to worry a little , Peis thought . She tended to be arrogant , to forget her position . Periodically , it was necessary to cut her down to size . Peis found Professor Friedrich Dyer where his daughter had said he would be , in his book-and-paper-cluttered room in one of the ancient buildings in the center of the university campus . He was a tall , thin , sharp-featured man ; and he looked cold , even though he was well covered . He wore a thick , tightly buttoned cardigan under his many-times-patched tweed jacket and a woolen shawl over his shoulders . The ancient buildings were impossible to heat , even when there was fuel . Professor Dyer looked at Peis with chilling contempt , but he said nothing and offered no greeting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Dyer hated the salute than out of any Nazi zeal of his own . " Heil Hitler , Herr Peis , " the professor said . " I was n't aware you are acquainted with Reichsminister Albert Speer , Professor , " Peis said . " I gather he 's here , " Dyer said . The professor was not surprised , and this surprised Peis . " You were supposed to meet him at the station , " Peis said . " No , " the dignified academic said simply . " The telegram said only that the Reichsminister would be here and wanted to see me . " " What about ? " " I really have no idea , " Professor Dyer said . Is that the truth ? Peis wondered . Or is the professor taking advantage of his association with the head of the Todt Organization and trying to impress me ? " He is at the Fulmar Electric Plant , " Peis said . " I am here to take you to him . " Professor Dyer nodded , then rose and with difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fur-collared overcoat . When he had finished struggling into it , the two top buttons would not fasten . He shrugged helplessly , set an old and shaggy fur cap on his head , and indicated that he was ready to go . The university was in the center of Marburg atop the hill , and the Fulmar Elektrisches Werk was about ten minutes north of town . It was an almost new , sprawling , windowless , oblong building with camouflage netting strung across it . The netting was intended to blend the plant into the steep hills around Marburg to make it invisible from the air . The plant had no guards now , but that was to change , Peis knew , as of the first of December . ( The coming change sparked considerable curiosity in Peis : What were they going to make in there that required all that security ? ) The local SS-SD office ( that is to say , Peis ) had been ordered to dig up before December enough " cleared " civilians to handle the security job . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police would have to provide the guard force , at the expense of whatever else they were supposed to be doing . Meanwhile , a substantial guardhouse had been built . And a nearly completed eight-foot fence , topped with barbed wire , surrounded the plant property . At hundred-yard intervals there were guard towers , with floodlights to illuminate the fence . Peis found Reichsminister Albert Speer and his party by driving around until he discovered the little convoy of " borrowed " automobiles . Speer was inside a work bay . The bay was half full of milling machines and lathes , and there were provisions for more . As soon as he saw Peis and Professor Dyer , Speer walked over to them . He was smiling , and his hand was extended . " Professor Doktor Dyer ? " Speer asked . " Herr Speer ? " Dyer replied , making a bow of his head and offering his hand . " I 'm very pleased to meet you , " Speer said . " I 've been reading with great interest your paper on the malleability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dyer asked , on the edge of rudeness . " There have been several . " " The one you delivered at Dresden , " Speer answered , seemingly ignoring Dyer 's tone . " That was the last , " Dyer said . Speer looked at Peis the way he would look at a servant . " We will be an hour , " Speer said , dismissing him , " perhaps a little longer . Could I impose further on your kindness and ask you to arrange for Professor Dyer to be returned afterward to wherever he wishes ? " " It will be my pleasure , Herr Reichsminister , " Peis said . " You are very kind , " Speer said . " I am at your service , Herr Reichsminister , " Peis said . Since there was time before he had to retrieve his car , Peis walked the new fence surrounding the plant . The professional cop in him liked what he saw . In his judgment , whoever had set up the fence knew what he was doing . It would be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or to get out of it . He noticed too , on his journey of inspection , that the fence enclosed an open area large enough to build laborer barracks . He had heard that the Todt Organization was recruiting laborers from France , Belgium , the Netherlandsand even from the Eastto work in German industry . They could not , of course , be permitted to roam freely around Germany . After his tour , he settled into his Mercedes-Benz and started the engine . It was a waste of fuel , but he wanted the engine running anyway , partly because he intended to turn on the radios ( unless the engine was running , the radios quickly drained the battery ) , but primarily because it was cold : Whatever the virtues of the Mercedes ' diesel engine , it was a sonofabitch to start when it was cold . He did not want Reichsminister Speer to remember him as the SS officer whose car could n't be made to run . Peis himself did n't mind some additional warmth either . Over the shortwave radio , Peis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reichminister 's railcar at the Bahnhof . He then tuned in Radio Frankfurt on the civilian band radio . The news was that the Wehrmacht in Russia continued to adjust its lines and inflict heavy casualties upon the enemy . But then there was a surprise : In blatant violation of international law , at four that morning , United States naval , air , and ground forces had started shelling and bombing French North Africa . Later , an American invasion force was sent ashore on both Atlantic and Mediterranean beaches . Terrible casualties were inflicted upon innocent , neutral civilians , etc. , etc. , etc . The invasion was obviously successful , Peis concluded . Otherwise , the announcer would have gleefully proclaimed that it had been thrown back into the sea . Why did n't the Americans mind their own damned business ? Peis wondered . Germany had no real quarrel with America . What the hell did they want with French North Africa , anyhow ? There was nothing there but sand and Arabs riding around on camels . And then he remembered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like himself : Obersturmbannfhrer SS-SD ( Lieutenant Colonel ) Johann Mller , who had been raised on a farm in Kolbe not three miles from where Peis sat , was on the staff of the Franco-German Armistice Commission for Morocco . Mller , who came home to see his mother from time to time , had once been a simple Wachtmann ( Patrolman ) on the Kreis Marburg police . But he had been smart enough to join the Nazi Party early on , and he had been transferred to Berlin and commissioned in the SS-SD . And now he was a big shot . Who just might , Peis thought , spend the rest of the war in an American POW cage . But better that , Peis decided , than the Eastern Front . It was an hour and a half before he saw Professor Friedrich Dyer walking toward the car . " You wo n't mind , Professor , if I see the Reichsminister safely onto his train ? " Peis said when Dyer had gotten into the car . " We all must do our duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's convoy to the Hauptbahnhof . On the way from the Hauptbahnhof to the university , Peis asked , as casually as he could , " What did Reichsminister Speer want with you ? " There was no reply for a moment , as Dyer considered his response . " We spoke of the molecular structure of tungsten carbon alloys , " Dyer finally said . " Specifically , the effect of high temperatures on their dimensions , and the difficulties encountered in their machining . " Peis had no idea what that meant , and he suspected that Dyer , aware of that , was rubbing his ignorance in his face . Yesterday , the professor would not have dared antagonize him . But they both knew that things had changed . " I have no idea what that means , " Peis admitted . And then he changed the subject before Dyer had a chance to reply : " Radio Frankfurt just said the Americans have invaded North Africa . " " Really ? " " You 're an educated man , Professor , " Peis said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No telling , " Professor Dyer said . And then he added , " You must remember , Herr Obersturmfhrer , that the Americans are crazy . " " Why do you say that ? " " Well , for one thing , they believe they can win this war , " Dyer said . " Would n't you say that makes them crazy ? " Peis 's face tightened as he realized that the professor had mocked him again . And his anger grew as he realized that there was absolutely nothing he could do about it . Peis did manage a parting shot , however . As the professor was about to slip out of the car , Peis stopped him with his hand and gave him a knowing , confidential look . " Do please give my very best regards to Frulein Dyer , " he said through his very best smile . Professor Dyer had no reply to make to that . TWO Ksar es Souk , Morocco 0700 Hours 9 November 1942 The palace of the Pasha of Ksar es Souk was pentagonal . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest office building , the Pentagon , in Washington , D.C. , and bore little resemblance to it . But it was unarguably five-sided , and it pleased the somewhat droll sense of humor of Eric Fulmar to think of the palace as " The Desert Pentagon . " There were five observation towers at each angle of the Desert Pentagon . Over the centuries , lookouts had reported from these the approach of camel caravans , tribes of nomads , armies of hostile sheikhs and pashasand in more recent times , patrols and detachments of the French Foreign Legion and the German Wehrmacht . Today , there was nothing in sight on the desert in any direction , and it was possible to see a little over seven miles . Eric Fulmar , who was tall , blond , and rather good-looking , sat in the northwest tower of the Desert Pentagon holding a small cup of black coffee . Except for olive-drab trousers and parachutist 's boots , he wore Berber attire , robes and a burnoose . The cords around his waist , as well as those holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the identification of a nobleman . Depending on whether his dossier was read in Washington , D.C. , or in Berlin , Germany , he was 2nd Lieutenant FULMAR , Eric , Infantry , Army of the United States , or Eric von Fulmar , Baron Kolbe . The chair he sat in was at least two hundred years old . He had tipped it back and was balancing on its rear legs . His feet rested on the railing of the tower . Beside him on the stone floor was a graceful silver coffeepot with a long , curving spout . Beside it was a bottle of Courvoisier cognac . His coffee was liberally braced with the cognac . Next to the coffeepot was a pair of Ernst Leitz , Wetzlar , 8-power binoculars resting on a leather case . And next to that was a Thompson .45-caliber ACP machine-pistolwhich is to say , a Thompson equipped with a pair of handgrips , rather than a forearm and a stock . The Thompson had a fifty-round drum magazine . Fulmar leaned over and picked up the Ernst Leitz binoculars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was hoping to see the cloud of dust an automobile would raise . When he saw nothing , he put the binoculars down , then leaned to the other side of the chair , where he 'd placed a Zenith battery-powered portable radio . He turned it on , and a torrent of Arabic flowed out . Fulmar listened a moment , then smiled and started to chuckle . It was an American broadcast , probably from Gibraltar , a message from Franklin Delano Roosevelt , President of the United States , to the Arabic-speaking population of Morocco . " Behold , the lionhearted American warriors have arrived , " the announcer solemnly proclaimed . " Speak with our fighting men and you will find them pleasing to the eye and gladdening to the heart . " " You bet your ass , " Fulmar said , chuckling . " Look in their eyes and smiling faces , " the announcer continued , " for they are holy warriors happy in their sacred work . If you see our German or Italian enemies marching against us , kill them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have set your hands upon . " " Like a camel turd , for example , " Fulmar offered helpfully . " The day of freedom has come ! " the announcer dramatically concluded . " Not quite , " Fulmar replied . " Almost , but not quite . " He was thinking of his own freedom . Second Lieutenant Fulmar was at the moment the bait in a trap . Well , there again , not quite . Some very responsible people considered it likely that the baitwhether through cowardice , enlightened self-interest , or simply ineptitudewould , so to speak , stand up in the trap and wave the sniffing rat away . The bait himself kind of liked that idea . That , of course , had n't been the way they had explained the job to him . In several little pep talks they 'd assured him they were totally confident that he could carry this " responsibility " off . But Fulmar 's lifelong experience with those in authority had taught him otherwise . Fulmar had his current situation pretty well figured out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he had received his first chess set , a Christmas gift from his mother 's employer when he was ten , he had been fascinated with the gameand intrigued by the ways it paralleled life . In life , for instance , just as in chess , pawns were cheerfully sacrificed when it seemed that would benefit the more powerful pieces . In this game , he was a white pawn . And he was being used as bait in the capture of two of the enemy 's pieces , whom Fulmar thought of as a bishop and a knight . The problem was that the black bishop and knight were accompanied by a number of other pawns both black and white . If the game went as planned ( here Life and Chess differed ) , the bishop and the knight would change sides . And the white pawn wearing the second lieutenant 's gold bar would be promoted to knight . If something went wrong , the second lieutenant pawn and the black pawns ( who did n't even know they were in play ) would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gameshot ) and the remaining players would continue the game . The bishop was a man named Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz , a Pomeranian aristocrat presently serving as the senior officer of the Franco-German Armistice Commission for Morocco . His knight was Obersturmbannfhrer SS-SD Johann Mller , presently serving as the Security Adviser to the Franco-German Armistice Commission . Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz , who had been educated at Harvard and had once been the German Consul General in New Orleans , had not long before established contact with Robert Murphy , the American Consul General for Morocco . Von Heurten-Mitnitz informed Murphy then that he was convinced Germany was in the hands of a madman and that the only salvation he saw for Germany was its quick defeat by the Western Powers . He was therefore prepared , he said , to do whatever was necessary to see that Germany lost the war as quickly as possible . The German diplomat went on to tell Murphy that Obersturmbannfhrer Mller , for his own reasons , had come to the same conclusion and was similarly offering his services : Through his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atrocities committed by the SS " Special Squads " on the Eastern Front and of the extermination camps operated at several locations by the SS . Mller was a professional policeman , and he was shocked by what the SS was doing ( it was not only inhuman , it was unprofessional ) . Also , Mller understood that his one great ambition in lifeto retire to the Hessian farm where he had been bornwould not be possible if he were tried as a war criminal and hanged . This being not only the real world , but also the real world at war , Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz 's noble offer could not be accepted at face value . His intentions had to be tested . He was offered a choice : He could do a job for the Americans , at genuine risk to himself ; or he could choose to satisfy other needs . Enter the pawns : There were in French Morocco a number of French officers , Army , Service de l'aire , and Navy , who did not regard it as their duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw it as their duty as officers to continue the fight against Germany . These officers had provided considerable information and other assistance to curious Americans . And they were fully aware that what they were doing was considered treason . Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz 's controller told him that he would be expected to round up twenty " treasonous " French officers whom the Americans wished to protect from French forces loyal to Vichy , and from the Germans themselves , and take them to the palace of the Pasha of Ksar es Souk , where they would be turned over to an American officer . The American officer was to be parachuted into Morocco shortly before the invasion began . As soon as possible after the ships of the American force appeared off the Moroccan coast , he would contact Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz to furnish the names of the twenty officers . Finally , Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz was informed that the American officer 's name was Second Lieutenant Eric Fulmar . Von Heurten-Mitnitz would not fail to take note of this . A U.S. Army second lieutenant , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small potatoes . But Second Lieutenant Fulmar , Infantry , United States Army , held dual citizenship . His father , the Baron von Fulmar , was not only highly placed in the Nazi Party , but was General Director of Fulmar Elektrische G.m.b.H . For months Eric Fulmar had been a thorn in the side of his father and of many highly placed Party officials . When the war began , Eric had been a student of electrical engineering at the University of Marburg an der Lahn . But he had not remained in Germany to accept his duty to don a uniform to fight for the Fatherland . Young Fulmar 's departure was of course seen as a mighty thumbing of his nose at the Thousand-Year Reich . In other words , he was a messy embarrassment to his father and the Party . Worse yet , he had not dignified his desertion by going to the United States . That could have been more or less explained . But he had gone to Morocco , of all places , as the guest of his classmate , Sidi Hassan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , he promptly made matters even worse by entering into the profitable business of smuggling gold , currency , and precious gems out of France through Morocco . His American passport and a diplomatic passport issued to him by the Pasha of Ksar es Souk saved him from arrest and prosecution . When Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz was named to the Franco-German Armistice Commission , one of his missions had been to see that young Fulmar was returned to Germany . His best efforts ( really those of Obersturmbannfhrer Mller ) had been to no avail . And when the Americans entered the warwhen he could have been arrested without offending American neutralityEric von Fulmar had simply disappeared . In the American vernacular , then , Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz and Obersturmbannfhrer Mller were now offered the choice of putting up or shutting up . The easiest thing for them would be to round up the twenty French officers and Baron Eric Fulmar and accept the congratulations of their superiors . It was hoped , of course , that , as their contribution to a quick end to the war , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ksar es Souk . Which , of course , was treason . More important , they would be compromised . Thereafter , the Americans would be able to demand other servicesunder threat of letting the SS know what they had done in Morocco . When he had parachuted into the desert near Ksar es Souk three days before , Lieutenant Eric Fulmar would not have been surprised to find himself immediately surrounded by Waffen-SS troops . As it happened , German troops did not meet him ; but this was no proof that Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz and Mller were playing the game as they were expected to . They may well have been waiting until he had furnished the names of the French officers before arresting him . As soon as the code word signaling that the invasion was about to begin came over the Zenith portable radio , he had called Rabat to order the delivery of the list of French officers to Mller . Then he had telephoned Mller and told him the list was in his mailbox . To Fulmar 's surprise , Mller had told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Souk . Mller was so clear and careful about the time of his arrival that Fulmar immediately suspected that when the truck appeared , it would be full of Waffen-SS troopers , not French officers . In view of that , he decided to change his plan to accompany the Berber force that would intercept the Mller convoy before it reached Ksar es Souk . He decided he would watch the intercept from the palace tower . Pawns are put in jeopardy , he thought . That 's part of the game . But nowhere is it written that they have to put themselves in jeopardy . When the announcer began to repeat the presidential proclamation , Fulmar searched through the broadcast band , hoping to pick up something else . There was nothing . He turned off the radio and picked up the binoculars again . This time there was a cloud of dust rising from the desert floor . Right on schedule . Fulmar slid off the antique chair and knelt on the stone floor in a position that would allow him to rest his elbows on the parapet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of the vehicles came into sight . It was a small , open , slab-sided vehiclea military version of the Volkswagen , Germany 's answer to the jeep . Four soldiers in the black uniforms of the Waffen-SS rode in the Volkswagen . Behind it was a French Panhard armored car . Fulmar frowned . The armored car was unexpected . It smelled like the trap he worried about . Behind the Panhard was a Citron sedan , and behind that a civilian truck , obviously just pressed into service . The truck was large enough to conceal twenty French officers . Or that many Waffen-SS troops . Behind the truck were two other slab-sided Volkswagens holding more Waffen-SS soldiers . About half a mile from Ksar es Souk , the convoy disappeared from sight in a dip in the terrain . And then it reappeared , rounded a turn , and skidded to a halt . The road had been blocked there by a four-foot-high pile of rocks . From the tower , Fulmar could see the Berbers waiting for the convoy , but to the Germans the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volkswagens and formed a defensive perimeter around the convoy . The Panhard moved in front of the leading Volkswagen and then tried to climb the pile of rocks . Nobody left the truck . Which meant nothing ; they might be trying to conceal the presence of more German troops as long as possible . Fulmar saw the muzzle flashes of the Panhard 's machine gun moments before he heard the sound . And then the Panhard burst into flame , and a huge plume of black gasoline smoke surged into the sky . There were more muzzle flashes , followed moments later by the rattle of the weapons . Two of the Waffen-SS troopers rushed toward a Berber position before being cut down . And then the others began to raise their hands in surrender . One German and three French officers , plus a Waffen-SS driver , came out of the Citron with their hands in the air . Then the truck disgorged a dozen more Frenchmenofficers , civilians , and , astonishingly , two women . The German officer almost certainly was Obersturmbannfhrer Mller . A Berber on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and took a long , meditative look at two of its crew who had escaped and were lying on the ground . He killed both of them with a burst from his Thompson machine-pistol . He then rode over to the place where the two Waffen-SS troopers had been cut down and fired short bursts into their bodies . More horsemen appeared . The remaining Germans , including the officer who had been in the Citron , had their hands tied behind them . A rope was looped around their necks , making a chain of them . And one of the Berbers on horseback started leading them toward Ksar es Souk . The French officers and the women were left unbound , but they were still unceremoniously herded down the road toward the palace . The vehicles were left where they had stopped . The operation had n't gone exactly as planned , but it had worked , and the armored car had n't been nearly as much of a problem as it could have been . And , obviously , Mller was doing what he had been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , picked up his Thompson machine-pistol , and wound his way carefully down the narrow stone stairs of the tower . At the bottom , he emerged into the courtyard . Spotting a small boy , he ordered him in fluent Arabic to fetch the cognac , the coffee service , and the radio from the tower . Then he started toward the gate from the inner to the outer courtyard . Just before he reached it , he covered his face below the eyes with part of the blue cloth of his headdress . The once-glistening parachutist 's boots were now scarred and torn by the rocks and bushes of the desert ; they looked like any old boots . He was quite indistinguishable from a bona fide Berber . In the outer courtyard there were a hundred Berbers , a third of them women in black robes . The men had painted their faces blue , as was their custom , and most of them were armed as he was with a Thompson . Off at one side , handlers held about forty horses . Fulmar made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told them what had happened . And then one of the Berbers touched his shoulder and nodded toward the gate . The horseman with the string of prisoners was now in sight . " As soon as he 's inside , go get the trucks and cars , " Fulmar ordered . " And see what you can do about hiding the armored car . " " Why ? " the Berber asked . " Just do it , " Fulmar said . The Berber made a mocking gesture of subservience . " I hear and obey , O son of heaven , " he said . " May you catch the French disease and your member turn green and fall off , " Fulmar said . They laughed at each other , and the Berber walked to where the horses were being held . He swung easily into a tooled leather saddle , then called out the names of half a dozen men , who trotted to the horses and mounted . They rode out of the courtyard as the German prisoners were led inside . The Germans appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be terrified too if I was being led with a rope around my neck into a King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table palace by a bunch of guys with blue faces and submachine guns . He turned to another Berber . " The stocky one , " he said . " The one without the leather equipment . Take him inside to the small room or the library . Leave someone with him and make sure that no one else goes into the room with him . " " And the others ? " " Take them into the main room and get them something to eat and drink . They are not to be bothered . " " Not even their boots ? " " Not even their boots , " Fulmar said . " They fought well . They deserve honorable treatment . " When the French arrived and had been herded into the courtyard , Fulmar walked up to them . " On behalf of His Excellency Sidi Hassan el Ferruch , Pasha of Ksar es Souk , I welcome you to his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is time , you will be taken behind American lines . " He spoke in French . They seemed to accept him as a French-speaking Berber . At least he got no surprised , wary looks . He was a little puzzled at the lack of excitement . No joy . No cries of pleasure . Then he realized that these people had expected to be taken somewhere in the desert and shot to death by the SS . They were in shock . They had n't quite understood yet that they would live . One of them , a wiry , intense little man , pulled himself together enough to start questioning Fulmar . But Fulmar turned and walked off without letting him finish . He went into the palace to the small room off the library . There was a Berber outside the door , and another inside . The German officer was sitting awkwardly on a three-legged stool , his hands still tied behind him . Fulmar walked over to him , took a curved blade knife from a jewel-encrusted scabbard on the gold cords around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone bring my cognac , " Fulmar ordered . " And coffee and oranges and some meat . " " Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? " the German officer asked as he rubbed his wrists . " Absolutely , " Fulmar said in flawless German . " I 'm an Alt-Marburger , you knowan alumnus of Philips University , Marburg an der Lahn . " " You 're Fulmar ? " the German asked , genuinely surprised . " At your service , Herr Obersturmbannfhrer , " Fulmar said . " Where the hell did that armored car come from ? That could have sent this whole operation down the toilet ! " " What was I supposed to say ? Thank you , I do n't need an armored car ' ? " " It could have fucked things up , " Fulmar repeated , repressing a smile . They looked at each other . " This is a little strange , is n't it ? " Fulmar asked . There had been a brief moment 's emotion . But as quickly as it had come up , both seemed anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to your end of the bargain ? " the German asked . " As soon as we get everybody safely out of sight , I 'll take you back to your car , " Fulmar said . " And what happens between there and Ourzazate ? " " You 're safe between here and there , " Fulmar said . " If I were you , I 'd be worried about getting from Ourzazate to Rabat . " The game was over , Fulmar thought . And the pawns had not been swept from the board . He wondered why he had no feeling of exultation , and the answer came immediately : A new game had already begun . THREE The Franco-German Armistice Commission Rabat , Morocco 10 November 1942 Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz was not in his office when Obersturmbannfhrer SS-SD Johann Mller went there looking for him . But Mller found him calmly packing his luggage in his apartment , a high-ceilinged well-furnished suite overlooking a palm-lined boulevard in the center of town . Von Heurten-Mitnitz was a tall , sharp-featured Pomeranian aristocrat , the younger brother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his family to serve his country as a diplomat . " Good afternoon , Obersturmbannfhrer , " von Heurten-Mitnitz said dryly as he placed a shirt in his suitcase . " You have doubtless come to tell me that our courageous French allies have driven the Americans into the sea ? " Obersturmbannfhrer Johann Mller snorted . " In a pig 's ass they have , " he said . " What is the situation ? " von Heurten-Mitnitz asked . Mller told him what had taken place just outside Ksar es Souk and of his meeting with Fulmar . " Finally , face-to-face , eh ? " Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz said . " What 's he like ? " " I thought he was an Arab at first , " Mller said . Von Heurten-Mitnitz looked at him , waiting for him to go on . " And somehow I expected him to be older , " Mller said . " Good-looking kid . Well set up . Smart . Sure of himself . " Von Heurten-Mitnitz nodded thoughtfully . The description was more or less what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " von Heurten-Mitnitz asked dryly . " I think the Americans will be here in Rabat in twenty-four hours , " Mller said . " Something is slowing them down ? " von Heurten-Mitnitz asked . " There 's a reliable rumor going around that they had to waste two hours sinking the invincible French North African fleet , " Mller replied . " Well , it appears that you and I are to be preserved from the Americans in order to assist in the future victory of the Fatherland . Passage has been arranged for you and me , and not more than one hundred kilos of official papers , et cetera , aboard a Junkers at half past eight , " von Heurten-Mitnitz said . " There is a fifty-kilo allowance for personal luggage . " " Why so late ? " Mller asked . " The Americans also wasted several hours sweeping the invincible French Service de l'aire from the skies , " von Heurten-Mitnitz said . " It was a choice between a U-boat and the Junkers at night . " Mller walked to a table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked , already pouring some of the liquor into a glass . " Of course , " Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz said . " And would you be good enough to pour one for me ? " When Mller handed von Heurten-Mitnitz the small , stemmed glass , he asked , " Did you know what the Americans had in mind ? " Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz met his eyes . " Not in the way I think you mean , " he said . " I knew they were coming . It was the logical thing for them to do , and I knew they were capable of mounting a transatlantic invasion force . But they did n't tell me about it . Murphy , in fact , went out of his way to lead me to believe the Americans intended to reinforce the British from Cairo . " " Then they did n't trust you , " Mller said simply . " So why trust them ? " Helmut von Heurten-Mitnitz sipped at his Steinhager before replying . " The simple answer to that , Johann , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to trust them . Do you understand ? I did n't expect them to tell me details of their invasion . " " We could arrange to be captured here , " Mller went on doggedly . " Have you thought about that ? We just do n't show up at the airport . " " That would work for you , " von Heurten-Mitnitz said . " If you want , you can do just that . " " It would n't work for you ? Why not ? " " You would be considered a soldier and become a POW , " von Heurten-Mitnitz said . " I have a diplomatic passport . I 'm quite sure they would put me on a plane to Lisbon for return to Germany . " " Not if you said you did n't want to go , " Mller said . " But I have to go , Johnny , " von Heurten-Mitnitz , said . " You understand that . " Mller snorted , drained his Steinhager , and poured another . " You have to put things in perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , the invasion of North Africa is already history . What they want me for is the future . " Mller grunted again . " What they want us for , you mean . " He paused , frowning . " And are n't you afraid that youand , for that matter , methat we 'll look bad in Berlin for not having done more than we did here ? " " Are we going to be blamed , you mean ? Or regarded with suspicion ? " von Heurten-Mitnitz asked and went on without waiting for a reply . " I do n't think so . I think what happened here will be regarded as yet another manifestation of French perfidy and ineptitude in battle . And with the Americans in Morocco , I think the Fhrer and his entourage will want to put the unpleasant subject out of mind . Until , of course , the Fhrer in his good time decides to take Morocco back . " Mller snorted derisively . " And have the Americans told you what they want from us in Germany ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I think the less you know about that now , the better . " He closed his suitcase and buckled its leather straps . " Are you packed ? " " I packed right after Fulmar telephoned me , " Mller said . " Well , then , let 's collect your luggage and go out to the airfield , " von Heurten-Mitnitz said . He looked at Mller . " Johnny , if you want to stay and be captured , I 'll understand . I can also come up with a convincing story to explain it back home . You know , devotion to duty and all the rest of it . " " Jesus Christ , do n't make it easy for me , " Mller said . " I 've almost talked myself into staying . Almost , shit ! When I walked in here , I was going to tell you I was staying . And then I remember what those swine did in Russia . What they 're doing in Germany , to Germans .... " " Yes , " von Heurten-Mitnitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I rather hate to be leaving , " he said . " There 's much about Morocco I really like . " Mller looked at him . " I wish we were going someplace besides Germany , " he said . ( Continues ... )
