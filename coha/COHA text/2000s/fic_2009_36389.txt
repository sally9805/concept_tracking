The colorful tents crowding the clearing where I stood would n't have looked out of place at a carnival or Renaissance fair . It would be an interesting irony : a Renaissance fair  --  a " rebirth " fair  --  here at the University of Tennessee 's Body Farm , the one place in the world that revolves around the study of the dead and how they decay . <p> The tents  --  white , red , green , yellow , blue  --  jostled for space at the Anthropology Research Facility . Decades earlier , an FBI agent had dubbed the UT facility " the Body Farm " after seeing the corpses scattered throughout the three wooded acres . The nickname had stuck , and now it was even inspiring a spin-off nickname : a former UT graduate student was now setting up a similar research facility in San Marcos , Texas . Even before her first research cadaver hit the ground , the Texas facility was being called " the Body Ranch . " <p> Several of the tents huddled together were supported by inflatable frames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huts , twenty-first-century style . Normally there were no tents here ; normally the brightest splash of color , apart from the grass and the leaves on the trees , was a large blue tarp draped over our corrugated-metal equipment shed and its small , fenced-in concrete pad . The tents  --  whose festive colors belied the barren winter landscape and bitter cold of the day  --  had been erected just twenty-four hours earlier , and twenty-four hours from now they would be gone again . Despite the carnival look , the tents were a stage for the acting out of a nightmare scenario , one of the darkest events imaginable : an act of nuclear terrorism . <p> A nude male body lay faceup on a gurney within the largest of the tents , his puckered skin gone gray and moldy from three weeks in the cooler at the morgue at the University of Tennessee Medical Center , visible just above the Body Farm 's wooden fence and barren treeline . Fourteen other bodies  --  selected and stored over the preceding month  --  were locked in a semi-tractor-trailer parked just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could be hundreds or thousands or even  --  God forbid  --  tens of thousands of victims if nuclear terrorists managed to inflict wholesale death in a U.S. city somewhere , someday . <p> Five people surrounded the gurney . Their faces and even their genders were masked by goggles , respirators , and baggy biohazard suits whose white Tyvek sleeves and legs were sealed with duct tape to black rubber gloves and boots . One of the white-garbed figures held a boxy beige instrument in one hand , and in the other , a metal wand that was connected to the box . As the wand swept a few inches above the head , then the chest and abdomen , and then each arm , the box emitted occasional clicks . As the wand neared the left knee , though , the clicks became rapid , then merged into a continuous buzz . Having spent my childhood shivering through the Cold War  --  practicing " duck and cover " during civil defense drills , as if my wooden school desk could shield me from a Soviet hydrogen bomb  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter . <p> As the wand hovered , the other four people leaned in to inspect the knee . One took photographs ; two others began spraying the body with a soapy-looking liquid and scrubbing the skin , paying particular attention to the knee . As they scrubbed , one of them removed a small orange disk , about the size of a quarter , and handed it to the team leader . A tiny , safely encapsulated speck of radioactive strontium  --  enough to trigger the Geiger counter , but not enough to pose any hazard  --  simulated contamination on the corpse . Once the scrubbing was complete , the technician with the Geiger counter checked the knee once more . This time the instrument ticked lazily , signaling normal background radiation . At a sign from the team leader , the body was wheeled out of the tent and returned to the trailer that held the other fourteen corpses , which had already undergone similar screening and decontamination procedures . <p> One by one , the Tyvek-suited figures rinsed off beneath what had to be the world 's coldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a last-minute addition necessitated by the day 's subfreezing temperatures . The team 's contamination , like that of the bodies , was simulated , but the goal was to make the training as realistic as possible , despite the added challenges provided by the bitter cold . Only after the shower did the goggles and respirators come off . My red-tressed , freckled graduate assistant , Miranda Lovelady , emerged from one of the white suits , followed shortly by Art Bohanan , the resident fingerprint expert at the Knoxville Police Department . The team leader was Hank Strickland , a health physicist , one who specialized in radiation and radiation safety . Hank worked at a facility in Oak Ridge called REAC/TS  --  the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center and Training Site  --  that sent medical response teams to help treat victims of radiation accidents anywhere in the world . But Hank , like Miranda and Art , was here today as a volunteer team member of DMORT , the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team . Formed in the early 1990s to identify victims of mass disasters such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Public Health Service , but the teams were staffed by volunteers with specialized , and even macabre , skills : their ranks included funeral directors , morticians , forensic dentists , physicians , forensic anthropologists , police officers , and fire fighters  --  people accustomed to working with bodies and bones . DMORT volunteers , including some of my students , had performed heroic service at Ground Zero after the World Trade Center bombings . They 'd also spent two months recovering and identifying bodies after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005 . Art himself had spent six weeks in Louisiana after Katrina , lifting fingerprints and palm prints from bloated , rotting corpses . One body was that of a man who 'd been trapped in an attic by rising waters . More than a hundred days after the man drowned in the attic  --  how ironic was that ?  --  Art and a colleague managed to lift a print and ID the man . <p> <br> Continues ...                @ @ @ @ @
