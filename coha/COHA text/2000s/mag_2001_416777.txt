An exhibition of Stanislav Libensky and Jaroslava Brychtova 's work at the Academy of Applied Arts honored professor Libensky 's 80th birthday . Across the Vltava River , which runs through the heart of the city , at the Tunnel Exhibition Space , the New York gallery owner Douglas Heller and Katya Kohoutova-Heller had co-curated a show of 28 pieces by 10 artists ( including the Americans Karen Lamonte and Charles Parriott ) working in the Czech Republic . As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vitality and range of glasswork being made today in that country . The enormous turnout , and the love shown towards Libensky at the exhibit 's opening , was testimony to the reverence in which he is held . Though his 24-year career as a teacher at the academy ended in 1987 , it 's clear that he remains a towering figure among students . Despite poor health , Libensky came to welcome the crowd with his signature smile , warmth and glowing eyes . Mounted high above the works in the exhibition sat a student-made , life-size nude plaster model of the artist crowned with a laurel wreath-a fitting testimonial to his lifetime focus on the human figure . The five Libensky/Brychtova cast pieces on display nicely illustrated the formal sophistication and technical virtuosity of this remarkable couple . The unique aspects of glass-its transparency and translucency , its ability to hold lightand dissolve color , its surface and inner textures-are central to the success of their works . The most recent sculptures are muted in color , simple in form and spiritual in content . They are large enigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece quietly breathes light . The Heller exhibition , " From the Czech Republic , " featured work by Jan Ambruz , Vladimir Bachorik , Lamonte , Ivan Mares , Parriott , Rony Plesl , Jaromir Rybak , Ivana Sramkova , Ales Vasicek and Dana Zamecnikova . Entering the exhibition , one was immediately struck by the absence of blown glass . In the Czech tradition , all the works , except Ambruz 's plate glass and bamboo installation , were cast . Highlights included Bachorik 's monochromatic sensual forms ( one of which was purchased by the Mint Museum of Craft + Design in Charlotte , North Carolina ) , Parriott 's Crown and Zamecnikova 's highly personal , sensitive painted pieces . - ROBERT KEHLMANN Photograph Robert Kehlmann , a glass artist and the author of 20th Century Stained Glass , A New Definition ( 1992 ) , lives in Berkeley , California .
