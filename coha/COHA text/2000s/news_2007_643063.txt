<p> Republican leaders across the country say they are growing increasingly anxious about their party 's chances of holding the White House , citing public dissatisfaction with President Bush , the political fallout from the war in Iraq and the problems their leading presidential candidates are having generating enthusiasm among conservative voters . <p> In interviews on Tuesday , the Republicans said they were concerned about signs of despondency among party members and fund-raisers , reflected in polls and the Democratic fund-raising advantage in the first quarter of the year . Many party leaders expressed worry that the party 's presidential candidates faced a tough course without some fundamental shift in the political dynamic . <p> " My level of concern and dismay is very , very high , " said Mickey Edwards , a Republican former congressman from Oklahoma who is now a lecturer in public policy at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton . " It 's not that I have any particular problem with the people who are running for the Republican nomination . I just do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravitational pull of the Bush administration . " <p> " We do n't have any candidates in the field now who are compelling , " Mr. Edwards said , adding : " It 's going to be a tough year for us . " <p> The Republicans made their comments a day before Senator John McCain of Arizona , once the party 's presumed front-runner , is to give a speech intended to revitalize his troubled candidacy . In the speech , focused on Iraq , Mr. McCain will warn against making policy about the war based on " the temporary favor of the latest public opinion poll " and assert that the administration 's strategy for securing Baghdad is the right one , according to excerpts released Tuesday by his campaign . The other two leading presidential contenders are Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts . <p> But Republicans around the country said the war was only one of the challenges facing Mr. McCain and the other candidates . Rick Beltram , a Republican county leader in Spartanburg , S.C. , said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for all the candidates as they visit his state , one of the most important in the Republican nominating process . <p> " I would say a lot of people are not turned on because they do n't see a lot of bright spots out there , " Mr. Beltram said . " Home prices are going down . Gas prices are going up . And the war keeps dragging on . " <p> Other Republicans , while acknowledging the widespread apprehension about the current state of play , said they were by no means giving up . <p> Fergus Cullen , the New Hampshire Republican Party chairman , said that a smart candidate could turn adversity to his advantage by figuring out a way to politely turn the page from the Bush era . " The situation with President Bush is allowing everyone to turn to a new campaign , " Mr. Cullen said , " and that is probably an asset to all the candidates . " <p> And Katon Dawson , the party chairman in South Carolina , expressed confidence that the party would recover from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . <p> " We do n't do well until we have a common enemy , " Mr. Dawson said . " Right now , our enemy is ourselves . " <p> Several Republicans also said they took hope from the fact that hypothetical polls matching the party 's leading presidential contenders with the main Democratic presidential contenders  --  Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani of New York versus Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois  --  showed the Republicans with an edge , even as so-called generic polls showed Americans were significantly more likely to say they would vote for an unnamed Democrat over an unnamed Republican next year . <p> But those notes of optimism did not erase the overall anxiety pervading the interviews . <p> Shawn Steele , the former Republican Party chairman in California , said the candidates were being dragged down by their associations with Mr. Bush as well as with the war . Mr. Steele and other Republicans argued that the candidates were in a difficult position as they tried to distance themselves from a president who is having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienating Republican base voters and donors who remain loyal to Mr. Bush and his foreign policy . <p> " It 's a dying administration , " Mr. Steele said . " There 's a fatigue factor and there 's a rubbing-off when it 's not very smart to be closely associated with such low ratings . " <p> Several Republican officials said one sign of the party 's spirits was the spike of interest created when Fred Thompson , a former senator from Tennessee and an actor who has not run for national office before , signaled that he might enter the race . He is not the only Republican waiting in the wings to see if any or all of these candidates falter : Newt Gingrich , the former House speaker , has said he might enter the race later this year ; Tommy G. Thompson , a former governor of Wisconsin got in last week ; and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , a critic of the war , has not ruled out running . <p> Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. , a former head of the Republican National Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats and associate itself with one winning issue if it was to have any hopes of holding on to the White House in 2008 . <p> " What Republicans have to do here in the next year is do something other than complain about the Democrats , " Mr. Fahrenkopf said . " What they have to do is take an issue  --  and I happen to believe the issue is immigration  --  they have to push very strongly for it . " <p> Still , even the most optimistic Republican officials said they thought Democrats were in a stronger position in a presidential race now than at any other time since 1996 . They noted polls showing that an increasing number of Americans were calling themselves Democrats , as well as the fund-raising numbers from the first-quarter that showed the Democrats ' presidential field had raised $78 million , about $27 million more than the Republicans . <p> Republican leaders pointed to a number of factors for the Republican malaise , including the perception that Mr. Giuliani , Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain were awkwardly altering their positions to appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after having Republicans in power for more than eight years . <p> Representative Jack Kingston , Republican of Georgia , said the Democratic takeover of Congress and the continuing grim news from Iraq had rendered Mr. Bush nearly irrelevant . <p> " If he plays his cards right , he comes back to relevant , " Mr. Kingston said of the president . " He is marginalized now . " <p> Alan K. Simpson , a former Republican senator from Wyoming , said the party 's presidential candidates were being whipsawed as they tried to appeal to conservative voters who have a history of strong views on issues like abortion and gay rights . " These tests are destroying the Republican Party , " Mr. Simpson said . <p> Republican leaders said they saw little chance the party could retain the White House if conditions in Iraq did not improve noticeably over the next year . <p> " The war in Iraq and public opposition to it has put a pall on Republicans , " said John C. Danforth , a former Republican senator from Missouri . <p> Representative Peter T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as the war appears not to be doing well , it 's going to hurt Republicans . " <p> The biggest problem , several Republicans said , is the disparity between the level of enthusiasm on display among Democrats and that on the Republican side . <p> " You 're seeing a carryover of the energy and the enthusiasm and the momentum from the 2006 Democratic takeover , " said Representative Adam H. Putnam , Republican of Florida . " Momentum is an important force in sports and politics , and the momentum is clearly on their side . " ##
