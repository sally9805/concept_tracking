Vanessa Rutledge stood in front of her husband 's grave , her coat pulled tightly around her against the crisp March breeze , red hair billowing in the wind . " I know this is going to seem like a strange request  --  but I just do n't know who else to ask . Matt , you know I love you , that I 'll always love you , that I see you in your son 's eyes every day . But , darling , I 'm going to love again , and I need your blessing . If I have that , I 'd like you to give the man who is to be my future a little nudge . Let him know it 's all right . Please ? Let him know he 's so much more than  --  " <p> " Vanessa ! " <p> Her father was standing out on the deck behind the house holding the baby away from himself , like he 'd just pooped on his mess dress . It was past time to leave . Little Matt had been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mel Sheridan for their first checkups since his birth . Her father , retired general Walt Booth , was acting as chauffeur so that he could watch the baby while Vanessa had her exam . <p> " Coming , Dad ! " she called . She looked back at the grave . " We 'll have a real conversation about this later , " she told the headstone . She blew a long kiss in that direction and hurried down the little hill , past the stable and up to the house . <p> The last place Vanessa ever expected to find herself was in a tiny mountain town of six hundred . When her father chose this property a couple of years before his retirement from the Army , she and Matt had taken a look at it . Matt fell in love with it at once . " When I go , " he had said , " plant me on that little hill , under that tree . " <p> " Stop it ! " she had laughed , slapping his arm , neither of them realizing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , years before she met Matt , that Vanni had envisioned herself as a high-powered news anchor ; using her degree in communications . She decided to take a year before pursuing an eighty-hour-a-week career path and , on a whim , went to work as a flight attendant . One year turned into five because she loved the job , the travel , the people . She 'd still been working for the airline when Matt left for Iraq . It was her loneliness and advancing pregnancy that had sent her packing to Virgin River . She had thought it would be temporary  --  she 'd have the baby , wait for her husband 's return from war and move on to his next assignment with him . Instead Matt was brought here , to that little hill with the tree on it . <p> She did n't cry as much anymore , though she missed him ; missed the laughter , the long , late-night talks . Missed having someone hold her , whisper to her . <p> Walt had the diaper bag slung over his shoulder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend too much time talking to that grave . We should 've put him somewhere else . Out of sight . " <p> " Oh , dear , " she said , lifting a curious eyebrow , the corner of her mouth twitching . " Matt has n't been complaining that I 'm bothering him , has he ? " <p> " Not funny , " he said . <p> " You worry too much , " she told her dad , taking the baby from him to put him in the car seat . " I 'm not brooding . There are some things no one but Matt should hear . And gee , he 's so handy " <p> " Vanessa ! For God 's sake ! " He took a breath . " You need girlfriends . " <p> She laughed at him . " I have plenty of girlfriends . " She had lots of girlfriends from flying days and , even though they did n't live nearby , they were great about visiting and staying in touch , giving her every opportunity to talk about Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll be happy to know Nikki 's coming up for the weekend , " she said . " A girlfriend . " <p> Walt hefted himself into the driver 's seat . " We 've been seeing a lot of Nikki lately . Either she ca n't stay away from the new baby or things are n't going so well with her and that that " Walt could n't seem to finish . <p> " She ca n't stay away from the baby and no , things are n't going well with Craig . I smell a split coming , " Vanessa said . <p> " I never liked him , " Walt said with a grunt . <p> " No one likes him . He 's an ass , " Vanni said . Her best friend , too sweet for her own good , wanted a husband and children , but instead was stuck with a live-in arrangement that had gone flat years ago , leaving her almost as alone as Vanni . <p> Vanni had other friends besides fellow flight attendants . She 'd begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her midwife , Mel Sheridan ; Paige , who worked alongside her husband in the only bar and grill in town ; Brie , Mel 's sister-in-law . Still , there were some things only Matt would understand . <p> When you live in a place like Virgin River where the doctor 's office only makes appointments on Wednesdays , it 's a pretty good bet there wo n't be any waiting around . Sure enough , Mel was standing in the reception area right inside the door waiting for them to arrive . Her face lit up in delight as they walked in and she immediately reached for the baby . " Ooooh , come heeeere , " she sang . " Let me look at you ! " She lifted him as if weighing him . Then she cuddled him close . " He 's looking good , Vanni . Getting nice and fat on the breast . " She looked at Walt . " How 's Grandpa doing ? " <p> " Grandpa could use more sleep , " Walt grumbled . <p> Vanessa made a face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up . He certainly ca n't help me nurse the baby . " <p> " I wake up , that 's all . And if I 'm up and Vanni 's up , I might as well see if she needs anything . " <p> Mel smiled at him . " That 's a good grandpa , " she said . " He 'll be sleeping through the night before you know it . " <p> " When did David sleep through the night ? " Vanni asked of Mel 's one-year-old . <p> " The first time or the last time ? " Mel asked . " You might not want to ask that  --  we have sleeping issues at our house . And now Jack lets him in the bed with us . Take my advice , do n't start that ! " <p> Vanessa peered at Mel 's growing tummy . David had just turned a year and their second baby was due in May . " I hope you have a really big bed , " she said . <p> " There will be plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on  --  let 's look at Mattie first and take care of his shots . " Mel carried the baby back to the exam room with Vanessa following behind . <p> Mel had delivered little Matt right in Vanessa 's bedroom and their bond had grown deep and strong . It did n't take long to determine the baby was at a good weight and in excellent health . " I 'll take him out to Walt while you get into a gown , how 's that ? " <p> " Thanks , " Vanni said . <p> A few minutes later Mel was back . " Your dad took the baby over to Jack 's for a cup of coffee . And some male bonding , I suppose . " <p> Vanni had taken her place on the exam table , and Mel checked her heart , blood pressure , and got her in position for a pelvic . " Everything looks great . You had a wonderful delivery , Vanni  --  you 're in excellent shape . And boy , did you lose weight quickly . Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in my old jeans yet . " <p> " I bet you 're close . Go ahead , sit up , " Mel said , offering a hand . " Anything we should talk about ? " <p> " Lots of things . Can I ask you something personal ? " <p> " You can always ask , " Mel said while writing in the chart . <p> " I know that before you married Jack , you were widowed " <p> Mel stopped writing . She closed the chart and looked at Vanni with a sympathetic smile . " I 've been expecting this conversation , " she said . <p> " How long was it ? " Vanni asked , and Mel knew exactly what she was referring to . <p> " I met Jack nine months after my husband 's death . I married him six months later . And if you confer with the town historian and gossips , <p> " We have a town historian ? " <p> " About six hundred of them , " Mel said with a laugh . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should consider moving to another town . " <p> " Matt 's only been dead a few months , but he 's been gone almost a year Mel , he was n't on a business trip . He was in combat , out of touch . I talked to him a total of three times , saw his face once on live video cam . The letters were short and sparse . It 's been a really long time since  --  " <p> Mel touched Vanni 's knee . " There 's no rule of thumb on this , Vanessa . Everything I 've read , and I 've read a lot about widowhood , says that when people enter new relationships relatively soon after losing a spouse , it indicates they had happiness in their marriage . Being married was a good experience for them . " She smiled . <p> " I did n't even know for sure I was pregnant when Matt left for Iraq last May . I 'm not thinking about another marriage , of course , " Vanni said . " But I am thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to be alone forever . " <p> " Of course you should n't be alone forever . You have a lot of life to live . " <p> Vanni smiled . " Should I be thinking about birth control ? " <p> " We can talk about that . You would n't want to be as unprepared as your midwife . Especially with having a baby to take care of . Believe me . " She took a breath and ran a hand over her big belly . " I would n't let myself think ahead ! I remember when my sister said , ' I know widows who have remarried , and are happy . ' I almost took her head off . I was appalled . I was n't at all hopeful life could go on . " <p> " It sure went on for you , " Vanni said . <p> " Boy howdy . I came here absolutely determined to live out my days lonely and miserable , but that damn Jack  --  he ambushed me . I think I fell in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought it . As though I might somehow be unfaithful to my husband 's memory by moving on , which was absurd . I had the kind of husband who would have wanted me to have love in my life , and I bet you did , too . " <p> " You do n't send a man off to war without talking a few things through  --  my parents taught me that . One of the first ways Tom and I figured out the general was headed for a possible deployment was when the paperwork came out . Wills , trusts , etcetera . Not just in case something happened to him , but what if he was away in some jungle or desert war zone and something happened to Mom ? " She smiled a bit wistfully . " Matt did n't dwell on the worst-case scenario , but he was quick and to the point . He said I was n't the type to wallow and he 'd be disappointed in me if I did . He had a few requests  --  where he wanted to be buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure his parents got regular visits especially if we had children . And  --  if a good man showed his face , I was not to hesitate . " She took a breath . " My requests of him were almost identical . " She straightened . " If I 'm lucky enough to run into another man half as wonderful as Matt , I should be ready . " <p> " Absolutely . It 's not at all impossible , even in little old Virgin River . Let 's get you something reliable while you 're considering all this . You want a pill you can take while breast-feeding ? Can I hook you up with a diaphragm or IUD ? Have you given the options any thought ? " <p> Vanni smiled gratefully . Of course she 'd thought about it . " Yes . IUD please . " <p> " Let 's go over the models , " Mel said . Then she smiled . " By the way , you 're all cleared for intercourse . Should you find " <p> Vanni laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good judgment . Make sure there 's a condom involved . We do n't want the transmission of any  --  " <p> " I have good judgment , " Vanni repeated . " And extremely good taste . " <p> There was a man on Vanessa 's mind , he was the reason she 'd found herself imploring Matt for help and blessings . Matt 's best friend ; her best friend . Paul . <p> He spent months in Virgin River , supporting and comforting her , spending Christmas away from his parents , brothers and their families . They spent a lot of time talking about Matt ; crying about Matt , lost in hours of sentimental remembering . Without Paul 's strength , she 'd never have gotten through the worst of it . He was her rock . <p> Her relationship with Paul went back much further , of course . It was n't as though they became friends because of Matt 's death . In fact , that night long ago when she met Matt , it had been Paul across the room who 'd first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs so long and hands so big , it was hard for him not to stand out in a crowd . There was that willful , sandy hair that had to be kept short because it would defy any kind of styling . Not that Paul was the kind of man to fuss with his hair  --  it was obvious even from a distance that he stuck to basics . It was his masculinity she noticed ; he looked like a lumberjack who 'd cleaned up to go into town . He had an engaging smile ; one tooth in front was just a little crooked and he had a dimple on the left cheek . Heavy brown brows , deep chocolate eyes  --  details she discovered a bit later , of course . She had n't even noticed Matt <p> But it was Matt who put the rush on her , swept her off her feet , made her laugh , made her blush . While Paul hung back , shy and silent , Matt charmed her to her very bones . And shortly after the charm , he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly a consolation prize  --  he was one of the best men in the world . And a devoted husband , so in love with her . <p> She loved Paul before Matt 's death , grew to love him more deeply afterward . When little Mattie was born , she said to Paul , " I will never love anyone but Matt . " But as the weeks passed she realized that she did n't have to stop loving Matt any more than Paul should . Matt would be with them both forever . And it was like the natural order of things that Paul should step in now . But there was no indication from him that he felt anything more than a special friendship . She had no doubt that Paul loved her , loved little Matt , but it did n't appear to be the kind of love that could warm her on cold nights . <p> She 'd called him several times since he 'd returned to Grants Pass ; polite and entertaining conversations about the baby , the town and his friends here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The baby 's gained a pound and a half already , " she told him . " He 's already changed so much . " <p> " Who does he look like ? " Paul asked . " Is his hair still dark or does he have a patch of fire on his head , like his mom ?
