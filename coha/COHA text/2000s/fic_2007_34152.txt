Chapter One ( Only Name the Quest ) " Run ! . . . Run , you scaredy cat ! The king will always beat you , Zoltan ! And all your dumb ugly creatures too ! Ha ! Just one of Arthur 's knights is better than your whole stupid army ! Ha , ha ha haaaa ! " Joby laughed in unrestrained exultation , brandishing his wooden sword from the castle walls as the humiliated enemy fled yet another great battle in disarray . " Joooooby ! . . . Joby ? " Joby 's shoulders slumped , but he ignored his mother 's voice and waved his sword once more at the fleeing horde . " I 've got better monsters than you out of my cereal ! " he hollered in contempt . " Joby . I know you can hear me , " his mother called , from the side yard this time . " Did you leave all this stuff on the driveway again ? " It was the kind of question Joby had never figured out how , or why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so , " he called back lamely , turning reluctantly from the battlefield beyond their backyard fence . His mother came around the corner of the house carrying a large disk of cardboard in one hand , painted yellow , a red dragon scrawled uncertainly at its center , a banged-up book in the other hand , and a tattered redbedspread draped over her arm . " It must have been some other knight then , " she said with the grim half smile that meant she was annoyed , but not enough to cause him any real trouble . Joby remembered having left these encumberments behind in the heat of battle , but , like any knight worth his salt , he knew when to keep his own counsel . Did she really think warriors could run around cleaning up in the middle of a battle ? Girls could be so pathetic ! His mother set his book , cape , and shield on the lawn in front of him and said , " If you do find the knight who left these there , please point out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes home . Unless that other knight wants tire tracks added to his family crest , he should find someplace better to leave his things . " Her grin widened . She seemed very pleased with herself for no reason Joby could see , but since this meant he was in even less trouble than he 'd thought , he obliged her by grinning back . " You might also tell him , " his mother added , " how tired I get of reminding Arthur 's knights not to leave their things where someone will break a leg on them . " Her grin faded as she reached up to tuck a stray lock of mahogany hair behind her ear , and went back to whatever she 'd been doing . " Break a leg on them , " Joby scoffed quietly , stooping to pick up his things . She always said that , as if people were out there snapping limbs off on every little thing they passed . His toys , his books , his trading cards , even his underwear ? Heaving a long-suffering sigh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . God help his mother if she ever got into a real battle . She 'd find out in a hurry how much more damage a mace could do than any pair of underpants she 'd ever seen . After looking hopefully out over the battlements again , Joby sadly decided that the enemy had truly given up and gone away . He slumped down against the fence , and wondered what to do , almost glad school was starting again soon . He 'd heard terrifying stories about what fifth- and sixth-graders did to fourth-graders at recess-especially during the first few weeks ; but he was practically dying to be an " upperclassman " at last . For one thing , he 'd finally be allowed to play dodgeball ! Sadly , all that was two weeks off yet . Practically forever . At the moment , it seemed practically forever just until lunch . Almost unconsciously , he opened the book , his most sacred possession ; the dog-eared , grime-smeared , finger-smudged , broken-spined , long since loose-leafed tome around which his entire cosmology revolved : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a gift from his grampa , entrusted to his parents on the day he was born ; and the very map and outline of his boyish soul had formed slowly around its contents . Even after nine years of punishing use , a marvelous smell still wafted from its pages whenever it was opened , like some pungent musty incense rising from within the cathedral of his most secret , joyful dreams . It had long since ceased to matter what page he opened to . Just lifting the Treasury 's battered cover transported Joby instantly to Arthur 's vast , shadowed throne room , dappled in misty rays of jeweled illumination streaming from stained-glass windows high above his head . He waited , as always , on one knee before the High King 's dais , his eyes cast respectfully toward the black-and-white marble floor tiles at his feet , his heart filled with the kind of urgent devotion that perhaps only a child can countenance-though here he was no child . Sir Joby was a knight ; handsome , brave , and loyal , awaiting , as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its beloved lord . At Arthur 's command , Sir Joby had battled countless tyrants and terrible beasts , withstood searing temptations , and defeated devious wizards , armed with nothing but unyielding faith and courage . In victory , Sir Joby felt his liege lord 's approval like a shimmering song through his entire being . And on those rare occasions when the beasts proved too fierce , the wizards too crafty , or the temptations too great , Joby had only to call out for rescue , knowing that Arthur would instantly appear with whatever feats of skill or miraculous power were required to save the day . Joby 's heroic liege lord , his finest friend , had never failed him , nor ever would . " My King , " Joby whispered , eyes closed in delicious expectation over the open book , quoting lines he 'd long since memorized , " I would serve you with my life . Only name the quest . " h Michael sat alone on the bright summer headlands , gazing out to sea , as still and silent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dun-colored cliffs two days before , he had suddenly been taken by the sparkle of afternoon sunlight on the restless Pacific surge beneath him , and sat down to watch awhile . He had neither slept , nor moved , nor blinked since that moment , but had given his entire attention to the theater of water , sky , and stone constantly transformed before him by starlight , moonlight , and sunlight in the dark breathless hours before dawn . . . and day and dusk and night and dawn again . He had served his Master here for nearly two hundred years , and still the novelty of so much beauty so completely unmarred by the Dark One 's touch had yet to wear thin for him-which is not to say that angels are easily entertained , only that they find more meaning in the least fragment of shell or surf-polished glass than the most appreciative mortal mind might draw from a Russian novel or a week at the Grand Canyon . His eyes and the summer sea passed a single shade of blue between them , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar rhyme shared by friends too long and well acquainted to have need of words . Back and forth , back and forth : his long ruddy-gold hair matched the tall dry grass around him , step for gentle step , in a long soft dance called by the warm wind sighing past them , headed north . He eavesdropped as the ocean whispered sweet cool nothings to distract the land while slyly dragging smooth round stones , one upon another , off the beach into its deep and secret pockets . Back and forth , back and forth ; the world around him swayed to rhythms with which he seemed to sway as well , despite his utter stillness . This reverie was finally broken by a thin column of pale smoke rising from a distant beach hidden behind the cliffs . It was Michael 's charge to know what passed in this favored place , down to the silent flutter of moth wings at any evening porch light in the village . But when he cast his quizzical awareness toward the beach , he sensed no one where logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above the spot where he 'd been sitting , a white gull wheeled on updrafts and turned to glide swiftly toward the mystery . Arriving there , Michael spread his wings and landed gracefully well down the strand from a grizzled old fisherman in heavy , salt-stained waders , standing at the ocean 's edge , patiently watching the tip of his long pole . Higher up the beach , a small driftwood fire blazed cheerfully in its ring of smooth gray stones . Maintaining his disguise , Michael aimed another mental probe . This time the man registered perfectly , his long life wound and stretched within him . A child 's simple pleasures ; laughing adolescent mischief ; early loves ; earnest youthful dreams and ambitions ; a radiant woman 's beaming face ; a child held ; flashes of joy , gratitude , and pride ; moments of affection , fear , and wonder ; griefs endured ; losses survived ; arrangements made ; acceptance ; in time contentment ; and finally . . . the deep and lasting peace that comes to some fortunate few with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a very fortunate old man 's memory . Yet Michael 's concern remained . The old man 's presence should have been as easily detected before . There was nowhere he could have gone to or come from in the few moments it had taken Michael to fly from where he 'd first seen smoke . He probed the old man 's mind again . Such broad passion and earthy understanding gradually unfolded amidst the small triumphs and crises of a modest life well and wisely lived . It all seemed too perfectly complete . Too beautifully drawn . Whatever the old man was , Michael felt certain he was not what he seemed ; and the presence in this protected refuge of anyone pretending so well to be what he was not could only spell very serious trouble . The old man reeled in his heavily weighted line , then cast it out again , seeming to relish the labor . An angel 's eyes are quick and keen , and Michael 's concern suddenly dissolved . He laughed a gull 's shrill staccato laugh , spread his wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he resumed his human form . Seeming unstartled by the bird 's sudden transformation , the old man merely grimaced in good-natured chagrin . " Welcome , My Lord . " Michael smiled . " I confess , You took me by surprise . " This seemed to please the ancient angler , deepening the leathery filigree of wrinkles around His wide gray eyes into a crinkled smile that barely brushed His lips . " How 'd you guess ? " He grumbled . " Your illusion was too perfect , " Michael replied , " though perhaps a moment late in coming . Then You reeled Your line in , and I saw You had . . . , " he smiled , " no bait . " The old man shrugged . " So ? Sneaky buggers tease the bait off all the time . " " Nor even any hook , My Lord , " Michael chided . " I know few others so in love with fishing for its own sake that even the hook is dispensable . " " Wan na know the secret of long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Assuredly , Lord , " Michael replied with as straight a face as he could manage . " Do n't sweat the small stuff . " The Creator eyed Michael sagely for a moment , then barked an old man 's raspy laugh . " Saw that on a bumper sticker comin ' over here . Ai n't that a good one ? Do n't sweat the small stuff . " He shook His scruffy head in bemusement . " Too bad the stress-case drivin ' that car does n't read his own liter'ture . " He looked joyfully at Michael then . " My friend , " He said with soft but fierce affection . " It 's so good to see you after so much time . " He reached up to grip Michael 's wide shoulders firmly in His weathered hands . " You look happy . " " I am , " Michael replied , quietly . " Any sadness I feel is reserved for the world beyond this place . To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure , Lord ? " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward His little fire . " Had some coffee with Gabe a while ago , but I did n't get a lot to eat . " " With pleasure , " Michael replied , following Him toward the fire ring . " But . . . what shall we breakfast on ? " " Fish , of course , " the old man replied as if Michael had n't the sense God gave him . " Fried up fresh with garlic salt and lemon ! " He produced a large unblemished lemon and a pale blue saltshaker from one of His small pockets . " But I see no fish , Lord , " Michael teased . " Did the sneaky buggers ' refuse to hold Your empty line bravely in their teeth while You reeled it in ? " The old man 's answer came suddenly , from the air , as a line of pelicans swept in above the beach , each dropping a fish at their feet as it passed . The fourth and last of these offerings , not a small fish , hit Michael squarely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That , " the old man said with ill-concealed mirth , " is for doubtin ' My skill as a fisherman . " He took a large frying pan from the same small pocket , and placed it on the fire . " I 'm sure I never doubted any such thing ! " Michael laughed , raking silver scales from his hair , and handing the somehow already gutted and cleaned fish to God . " You doubtin ' My word again ? " the Creator retorted , laying them in the somehow already greased pan , and seasoning them . " I doubt You not at all . " Michael smiled back , warming to the game . " I know , " the old man said , his manner suddenly devoid of play , though no less affectionate . " I trust you too , Michael . I 'm countin ' on that trust just now . " " How could I behold all this , " Michael insisted , arms spread wide at the scene around him , " and not trust the One who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for this place , have n't you , Michael . " " It 's surely the fairest place left on this continent , " the angel answered . " I 've come to love the villagers ; especially the children . . . . What 's wrong , My Lord ? Do you need me elsewhere ? I confess , I 'll miss them terribly ; but if You ask it , I will gladly- " " No , " the Creator assured him softly . " You 'll be needed here worse than ever now . " He turned a troubled countenance toward the horizon . " Michael . . . I mean to let our old enemy-yours and mine-in on the secret of this place , and . . . well , more or less let him do what he likes about it . " There was a moment of stunned silence . Even angels can be surprised . " This ? " Michael whispered at last in something close to disbelief . " You 're giving it to him ? " He searched the timeworn face his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not to understand . " Have we done something to displease You , Lord ? " " Heavens no ! " the old man rasped . " Then why ? " Michael pled . " This morning , I agreed to join that old lamprey in a certain wager . You 'll know the one , I expect . " " And this place was forfeit ? This morning . . . and he 's already won ? How- " " Course not , " God growled , patiently . " I have n't even named my candidate yet . This place is as unknown to him as it ever was . But that 'll have to change before much longer . " The old man 's fog-colored eyes fell full on Michael . " Still trust Me , friend ? " Michael 's consternation dissolved into contrition . " Of course , My Lord . As much as ever . It 's just that . . . " He bowed his head , gazing first at the sand between his feet , then at the fire where their fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . " " I 'm sorry , Michael . . . deeply sorry . There are reasons . You know Me at least that well . . . . You also know how damned little I can say about it . That slippery eel claims I 've compromised the wager ; I 'll have to forfeit . None of us wants that-'specially this time . I only came to warn you and make sure that when the storm blows in you make no move to stop it , even though the poor lad 's wake 'll surely be full of sharks and worse . You 've guarded this place well , My friend . You have My heartfelt thanks . But when he comes , you 'll have to let the whole filthy cargo come ashore with him . That 's about all I can say . You , better than most , know the usual rules of this engagement . " " Then . . . I may do nothing , " the angel pleaded , " but stand and watch all we love here trampled by that pestilent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve our friends to fight their battles for ' em , Michael . " " But , who here knows the first thing about fighting ? " Michael pressed in frustration . " Half of them are utter innocents ! The rest are refugees ! They 'll be helpless as feathers in a gale ! If I 'm forbidden to interfere- " " With the candidate , Michael . Do n't go belly up on Me now . The folks here are still under your care . The wager do n't change that . You 've many years by their reckoning . Must n't tell them of the wager itself , of course . That would be blatant grounds for defaulting to Old Sulfur Stacks . But there 's no law sayin ' you ca n't teach your little flock to read the weather , and rig a tarp or two against the smell of rain . " Michael 's troubled heart grew calmer as understanding dawned . " That much I will surely do , " he answered grimly . " Good . . . . I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen your wits this addled since that old blowfish made war on Heaven . " Then something else occurred to Michael . " Are they to lose the Cup then ? " " No , " the Creator said . " It stays , if they can keep it . " He sighed heavily , and looked up at the sky in consternation , or a damn good impression of it . " I 've got pretty deep faith in the boats I build , " he said . Then , more quietly , " May they have faith in Me . " " How am I to know when it is time to step aside ? " Michael asked . " You 'll know him when the time comes , " the Creator said sadly . " He 'll be pretty banged up and full of leaks by then , I imagine . But you 'll know him . ' Til then , keep guarding the borders , and teach the villagers . . . something of caution . Once it starts , everyone 's on their own . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the surf seemed pensive . " He 'll need a friend , Michael . Awful bad , I expect . A whole fleet of friends , if he can find ' em . That 'll likely be harder than it sounds , by then . " The Creator looked out to sea , and Michael wondered if it were tears he saw in the fisherman 's rough gray eyes , or just the watery seep of old age . " You should see him now , " the old man sighed . " You 'd love him , Michael . You 'd love him fiercely . " They were tears , all right . And Michael understood them all too well .
