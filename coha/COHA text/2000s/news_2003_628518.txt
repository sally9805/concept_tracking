<p> NEW YORK - As Billy Wagner took over in the ninth inning , the five Astros pitchers who preceded him to the mound Wednesday night sat together nervously in the visitors ' clubhouse at Yankee Stadium . They were glued to the television broadcasting their nine innings of glory , and they were n't afraid of jinxing themselves . <p> Under normal circumstances , baseball superstitions would call for Roy Oswalt , Pete Munro , Kirk Saarloos , Brad Lidge and Octavio Dotel to keep quiet about the no-hitter in process . <p> Lidge is a bit of a baseball history buff , though , so he began taking notes and speaking openly about the no-hit bid . He was well aware of the history the six Astros pitchers made when they combined to no-hit the New York Yankees in an 8-0 victory before an appreciative crowd of 29,905 . <p> Before Wagner covered first and took Jeff Bagwell 's toss on Hideki Matsui 's grounder to seal the 10th no-hitter in franchise history , no team in major-league history had thrown a no-hitter using more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm probably the most excited person , " said Lidge ( 4-0 ) , who was credited with the victory after two scoreless innings . " It 's amazing just to be a part of this . " <p> The Yankees , who have been no-hit only seven times , had not been held without a hit since Hall of Fame knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm of the Baltimore Orioles accomplished the feat on Sept. 20 , 1958 . The Yankees had played 6,980 games between Wilhelm 's gem and the Astros ' combined no-hitter . <p> These kinds of things just do n't happen often to a franchise that currently boasts the biggest payroll in baseball at more than $ 150 million . Moreover , the Yankees had not been no-hit at home since Aug. 25 , 1952 , when Detroit 's Virgil Trucks silenced them . <p> The only perfect game - 27 up and 27 down - in World Series history was thrown at Yankee Stadium by Don Larsen . David Cone and David Wells also threw perfect games here . But even using the special standards by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oswalt , Munro , Saarloos , Lidge and Dotel were not afraid to discuss the history as Wagner took over . <p> " It 's a little bit different , " Saarloos said after pitching 1 1/3 innings . " You have five relievers . None of us really knew about it until we were sitting here undressing and looked at the scoreboard . " <p> Jimy Williams , who mixed and matched his relievers through the no-hitter , did n't even realize what was transpiring until he peeked at the scoreboard in the seventh inning . The Astros manager was too worried about getting through the game after Oswalt , his ace righthander , left in the second inning with a strained right groin . <p> " I did n't know until the seventh inning , I 'll be honest with you , " Williams said . " I did n't know they did n't have any hits until the seventh . We had already used four pitchers , and we got a lead , and we 're trying to win this game , and I did n't really know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew they had a lot of baserunners , so when you have baserunners you think , ' Well , somebody must have gotten on with a hit . ' Then I looked up there , and there was a zero there . I started trying to remember when they got a hit . Even though we were moving pitchers and changing pitchers and they had baserunners , they did n't have a hit . " <p> The Yankees put six runners on base with three walks , one hit batter , an error and a wild pitch on a strikeout . <p> With so many Astros pitchers strolling to and from the mound , catcher Brad Ausmus also did n't realize the history in the making until about the sixth inning . <p> Oswalt retired the side in order in the first , but he left with a 1-1 count on leadoff hitter Jorge Posada in the second . Munro took over and came through with 2 2/3 innings despite walking three batters . <p> The Yankees loaded the bases on Munro with two outs in the third , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the keys to the no-hit bid came with one out in the third when Juan Rivera hit a slow grounder to third , where Geoff Blum charged the ball before barely throwing out Rivera at first . <p> Saarloos relieved Munro with two outs and a man on in the fourth . Saarloos got a boost from left fielder Lance Berkman , who rushed in and made a diving catch on Alfonso Soriano 's sinking line drive for the second out of the fifth . <p> " Obviously , Lance 's catch turned out to be a huge play , " Saarloos said . " I threw a changeup , Soriano hit it , and Lance made a great catch . Usually in games like this , there are one or two plays that make the difference , and that one sticks out in my mind . " <p> Lidge followed with two scoreless innings , striking out two while retiring the six Yankees he faced in order . Dotel handled the eighth , striking out four to tie a major-league record and becoming the second pitcher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Scott was the first on Sept. 3 , 1986 , at Chicago . <p> Dotel had to strike out four because Soriano reached base on a wild pitch after swinging through a strike-three slider that broke away from Ausmus . Dotel responded by striking out Jeter and Jason Giambi to end the inning . <p> The Astros got all the offense they needed in the first inning when Craig Biggio scored on Jeff Weaver 's high 1-2 wild pitch to Berkman . Jose Vizcaino 's sacrifice fly in the second made it 2-0 . Berkman put the Astros ahead 4-0 with a two-run homer into the third deck behind the right-field wall in the third inning . <p> " What dictated it was our starter went out after one inning , and we had a 2-0 lead , " Williams said . " So , you say , ' Well , are you going to try to piece it ? ' We 're going to try to piece now the best we can and see if we can win this game because we 're ahead 2-0 . Can we add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to find out . So we came with Munro and then Saarloos . " <p> By the time Wagner took over , Oswalt , Munro , Saarloos , Lidge and Dotel were following every pitch from the locker room <p> They inched closer to the television , they admitted , as Posada and Bubba Trammell struck out to begin the inning . <p> Once Matsui was out , they no longer could hold their excitement . <p> " We just ran out there , " Dotel said . " This is the greatest thing that could have happened to us , especially after Oswalt got hurt . This was awesome , especially at Yankee Stadium . " <p> <p> NOTABLE <p> Six pitchers the most ever to combine on a no-hitter . <p> First no-hitter against the Yankees in 6,980 games - the longest streak in major-league history - dating to 1958 . <p> First no-hitter by a visitor at Yankee Stadium since 1952 . <p> First Astros no-hitter since Darryl Kile 's against Mets on Sept. 8 , 1993 . <p> Tenth no-hitter in Astros history . <p> Seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young in 1908 . <p> <p> Astros no-hitters <p> Date Player Score <p> June 11 , 2003 Roy Oswalt , Astros 8 , Yankees 0 <p> Pete Munro , <p> Kirk Saarloos , <p> Brad Lidge , <p> Octavio Dotel , <p> Billy Wagner <p> Sept. 8 , 1993 Darryl Kile Astros 7 , Mets 1 <p> Sept. 25 , 1986 Mike Scott Astros 2 , Giants 0 <p> Sept. 26 , 1981 Nolan Ryan Astros 5 , Dodgers 0 <p> April 7 , 1979 Ken Forsch Astros 6 , Braves 0 <p> July 9 , 1976 Larry Dierker Astros 6 , Expos 0 <p> May 1 , 1969 Don Wilson Astros 4 , Reds 0 <p> June 18 , 1967 Don Wilson Astros 2 , Braves 0 <p> April 23 , 1964 Ken Johnson Reds 1 , Astros 0 <p> May 17 , 1963 Don Nottebart Astros 4 , Phillies 1 <p> <p> Astros ' perfect 10 <p> 1 .

Pete Rose reached second when Johnson fielded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Chico Ruiz groundout and scored on Nellie Fox 's error on a Vada Pinson grounder with two out . <p> The final out : Johnny Weekly faced Nuxhall with the potential tying run , in the form of pinch runner Bob Lillis , on first , but was called out on strikes . <p> Supporting cast : Fox , who made the error that ultimately cost Johnson the game , was the only Colts player with two hits . <p> Did you know : Johnson was the ninth major-league pitcher who lost despite throwing at least nine innings of no-hit ball and the first to lose the game in the ninth . <p> 3 . DON WILSON <p> Score : Astros 2 , Braves 0 <p> Date : June 18 , 1967 <p> Site : Astrodome <p> How he did it : Wilson struck out 15 on the heels of a 13-strikeout effort in his previous outing . He retired the first 14 batters before walking Denis Menke , who also walked in the eighth before Wilson struck out the side . <p> The final out : Hank Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Both runs came in the fourth . Jim Wynn doubled to drive in Sonny Jackson , who had singled , then scored on an Eddie Mathews infield out after Rusty Staub singled . Bob Aspromonte had the defensive plays of the game , fielding Felipe Alou 's sharply hit grounder and getting Alou at first , and getting Alou on a pop foul in the ninth inning that catcher Dave Adlesh lost in the Astrodome lights . <p> Did you know : Wilson threw 143 pitches , including 110 fastballs .

He thought Cincinnati had tried to show up the Astros in a 14-0 Reds win nine days earlier and hit Johnny Bench , whom he blamed for some of the hot-dogging in the earlier game , with a pitch .

He struck out 13 batters and retired 14 in a row at one stretch as Houston clinched the National League West title . Oddly enough , his first pitch of the game hit Giants outfielder Dan Gladden in the back . <p> The final out : Will Clark grounded to first baseman Glenn Davis , unassisted . <p> Supporting cast : Denny Walling gave Houston the lead with a solo homer in the fifth , and Jose Cruz drove in Walling with a seventh-inning single .
