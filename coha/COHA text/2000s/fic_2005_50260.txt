IT WAS TIME for a good cry . <p> My agent , Shanna Dimpflmaier , had just delivered the bad news about the nine-months sales figures for my latest novel , Wrestling with Smoke . <p> " Carol , honey , I 'm so sorry . You 'll crack four figures yet , I promise . I 've got a review lined up in the Twin Cities Literary Gatekeeper . And you 're booked for an interview on the NPR franchise in Sioux Falls . Once Klonpff senses there 's a groundswell of interest in your book , I 'm sure they 'll cut loose some publicity money - " <p> " Oh , horsepoop , Shanna ! " I seldom swore , but the circumstances demanded such foul language . " You know as well as I do that Klonpff has written me and my book off . My prose is too fine , my themes too subtle . They 're betraying their entire heritage of literary fiction by this callous abandonment , sacrificing me for the bottom line - " <p> " Carol , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reread your many good reviews , and consider just how lucky you were to have a rather , shall we say , ' precious ' book like yours published at all in this economic climate . This surly attitude of yours does not bode well for future projects . Good-bye . " <p> I hung up the phone , feeling an enormous weariness and sadness descend on my shoulders , like an invisible shawl made of my deceased mother 's favorite brand of liverwurst . Great . I had just alienated the last support I had in the publishing industry . What foolish move would I perform next to destroy my literary career ? A poledance on Oprah ? <p> So that 's when I had my good cry . <p> While the tears were still drying , I poured myself the glass of wine Shanna had recommended - but a tart Pinot Grigio , not Chardonnay - and pondered my future . <p> My manuscript-in-progress a memoir about my youthful experience as an altar girl , titled My Soul for All to see - now seemed remote and unworkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in a closet . How could I possibly go on , dragging exquisite sentences up from the depths of my being , in the face of such contumely and inattention from the world ? Where was my natural audience ? Surely my words should be reaching more than seven hundred and thirty-six readers , no matter how exquisitely sensitive those select readers might be .... <p> By the time I had sipped my way through half the bottle of wine , I was feeling so maudlin and despairing about my future that I could n't even jot down useful notes about my mental condition for incorporation into future quasi-autobiographical passages . <p> And that 's when it happened . <p> The front door to my home burst open , several windows shattered , and suddenly my living room was filled with five striking Amazons . <p> The five women - all Caucasian , ranging in age from their twenties to their fifties - wore matching white jumpsuits with modest necklines . No tawdry superhero display of cleavage here . Their shoes were sensible flats . They carried stylish purple messenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the women , the only one wearing eyeglasses , spoke first . <p> " Are you Carol Neatsfoot ? " <p> " Yes .... " <p> " We 're here to revive your literary career . We 're Moody 's Angels ! " <p> With those words , recognition bloomed like the roses in my grandmother 's garden before her descent into madness . <p> Before me stood the five female authors who had formed the muchreviled slate for last year 's National Book Award : Kate Walbert , Joan Silber , Christine Schutt , Lily Tuck , and Sarah Shun-lien Bynum . <p> But what were they doing dressed like this , away from their keyboards ? <p> " I - I do n't understand .... " <p> " Let us put Rick on speakerphone , " said the youngest and cutest . " Having won many more awards than we , he 'll be able to explain more cogently . " <p> Schutt removed a trim speakerphone from her messenger bag and jacked it into my house 's outlet . Instantly , the phone rang , and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was parsing my problems . <p> " Hello , Carol . I 've just recently become aware of your situation , and I 've dispatched my Angels to remedy it . A fragile , finely honed talent such as yours needs the nurturing that only a plethora of awards nominations can provide . And it 's the job of me and my ' girls ' " - I could hear the postmodern ironical quotation marks around the word " girls " - " to see that you get them . <p> " As a direct result of the publicity that 's accrued to them since last year 's NBA controversy , the women you see before you have all been nominated to judgeships for various literary awards . Their mission - along with that of me and my many ' co-conspirators ' such as Stewart O'Nan - is to nominate as many unsung , hermetic , paltry-selling authors for as many prizes as possible . And I 'm pleased to announce that you , Carol Neatsfoot , qualify eminently . " <p> " Why-thank you-I think .... " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all well-off , Holly wood-friendly **32;2384;TOOLONG male writers such as myself - who by the way has survived and flourished after being called ' the worst writer of my generation ' in the pages of The New Republic - to foist our tastes on the great unwashed masses . <p> " Now , Carol , I do n't want you to get your hopes up too high . Award nominations and public ridicule can only do so much to advance a writer 's career . But I do want to mention one name that might hint at what we can accomplish when our team puts its back to the wheel of publicity . Elfriede Jelinek . " <p> " Who ? " <p> Rick Moody 's voice acquired a testy tone , rather like that of my first husband whenever I used to burn supper whilst in the throes of composition . <p> " The latest winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature ? Author of Bambiland and other masterpieces ? That Elfriede Jelinek ? " <p> " Oh , right . Sorry . " <p> " No problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me just ask you one final question . Have you published work in any other genre ? We 're perform ing our careerboosting function across the publishing spectrum , just to illustrate our broad-mindedness . For instance , I could easily get you a slot on the Compton Crook Award ballot , or a William L. Crawf ord Award nomination , if you had written any science fiction at all . Maybe even a Susan C. Petrey Scholarship to Clarion . Just so long as your work has never actually sold more than a hundred copies or so . " <p> Something about Rick 's question piqued my interest , but I had to confess to him that I had always been a firm believer in mimesis . <p> " Well , no matter . We 'll just have to be content with a Pulitzer . Now , girls , if one of you will get Carol 's signature on the official credo while the rest of you restore Ms. Neatsfoot 's home to the condition in which you found it , I think we can call this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to me bearing , of all things , a tattered napkin . <p> " This is the original napkin on which Stewart O'Nan penned our manifesto about poor sales being no indicator of literary quality . If you 'd just sign right here , you 'll become a member of our ever-growing tribe of slighted geniuses . " <p> I signed , but with growing trepidation . Then , before I could count to sixty , as if in a childish game of hide-and-seek like the one where I had been " It " and all my friends had gone to the movies without me while my eyes were still closed , the five women reglazed my broken windows , repaired the latch on the door , unplugged the speaker-phone , and vanished . <p> I sat back in my chair , stunned . Then I corked the bottle of wine , and instead dug out a fifth of whisky last used for spiking holiday eggnog . I poured myself a stiff shot , carried it to my computer , and , booted up my word-processing program . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But first I grabbed my copy of Mary Doria Russell 's The Sparrow off my shelves , so I could find the dedication where she revealed the name of her agent . <p>
