Chapter One On Eagle 's Wings Grant Okay , the car was n't his style . If he were still single , he 'd be driving something low and muscular , with a big V-8 rumbling under the hood . And a few dents , as well . A spot or two of rust . Just enough to show that this baby had seen some action , put in some miles , and was n't to be messed with . Instead , he was at the wheel of a blue Chevy Celebrity . Not a bad car . It 'd been their first big purchase as a married couple , and Brooke had won him over with her argument that a four-door would soon be a necessity . He agreed . This was no longer the Grant Taylor show . He now had a wife to think about , and children somewhere down the road . Wow . There 's a wild thought . First things first , he decided . That was the way he liked to do things-in order , with a specific plan . Moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , with a minor in sports management ? Check . A beautiful bride of eight months ? Check . God had been good to them . And now , after years of athletics and studies on both their parts , they were en route to his first coaching position . They were leaving behind some fond memories at Georgia Southern University , ready to create new ones amid the tilled farms and pecan groves of little Albany , in the state 's southwestern corner . FACING THE GIANTS " This is the exit , Grant . " Brooke leaned forward in the passenger seat and looked up at the US 80 road sign . " We 're still gon na stop , are n't we ? " " If that 's what you want . " " Do n't you wan na see it ? The thing was built in 1880 . " " Sounds old . " She brushed blonde hair back over her ear and looked sideways at him . " Okay , " he said . " We 'll stop . " A scenic detour . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had their whole lives charted out in front of them . According to MapQuest , the trek from Statesboro to Albany would take less than four hours . With the small U-Haul trailer , they might lose a little time , but not much . Soon they would pull into the driveway of the house they had purchased two weeks ago , unload boxes , and begin making it into a home . If things went as planned , if he had the sort of long-term success that Coach Dooley had in his years at the University of Georgia , Coach Grant Taylor would become a household name and have hundreds , even thousands , of boys who would point back to his influence in their young lives . He was going from the GSU Eagles to the Eagles at Shiloh Christian . For him , that had been a good sign . He was flying high . If Brooke wanted to take a little side trip , then that 's what they 'd do . Brooke " Ahhh , " said Brooke . She took one skip toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hoping to visit George L. Smith State Park for years . " Just look at it . It 's so sweet . " Grant put his hands on his waist . " It 's a bridge . With a roof . " " Built over a hundred years ago . Just think , people used to ride their carriages along there . Let 's go walk through it . " Her husband looked unimpressed . " Come on , " she said . " I thought I married a hopeless romantic . " " Tell me one football player you know who 's a romantic . " " You . " He glanced at his watch . " You do n't fool me , Grant Taylor . " She slipped her arm into his and pulled him along , nearly skipping again . " We 're going on a walk together . " The Parrish Mill Bridge was made of dark weathered wood , with double doors opened on both ends . Beneath the structure , a mill worked in conjunction with a dam . Inside , they found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fifteen Mile Creek cascading beneath them . Brooke stopped and let go of Grant 's hand . " Can you see what I 'm doing ? " " No , it 's too dark . " " Let your eyes adjust . " " I ... You 're ... " " I 'm waiting for you to give me a kiss . " He did n't need any more prodding than that . On the other side , they found a bench swing . They sat side by side , rocking in the afternoon warmth . The sun was making a slow descent into the west , outlining the shapes of trees and turning the sky a ripe peach color . " What 's this remind you of ? " " Our first date , " Grant said . " At the Brooklet Peanut Festival . " She had nothing to say after that . The fact that he remembered was enough . On their trip to this point , they 'd passed spook houses , courthouse squares , and antebellum mansions that looked like sets from Gone with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even Grant seemed to like it , though he had n't said so out loud . Men , Brooke thought . They 're just like little boys sometimes , trying to act so tough . The mere thought of having their own son one day brought a huge smile to her face . Would he have Grant 's same adorable gap between his teeth ? Would he get her eyes ? If they had a girl , Brooke just hoped the poor thing would n't inherit those bushy Taylor eyebrows . " What 're you thinking about ? " " You and me , " she said . " Our future together . " " Must be good , judging by your smile . " Grant " Albany , here we come . " Grant drove along Highway 300 , his elbow propped out the driver 's window . Only a few more miles to Dougherty County . The route took them past peanut farms and occasional stands of cypress standing in black swamp water . Pines lined the road most of the way . Despite the wear of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled into town . This was it . On Monday , he would tour the grounds at Shiloh Christian Academy , meet his new team , and start putting them through daily doubles in preparation for the first game of the season . And their first victory . Soon , winning would be the norm at SCA . After unhitching the U-Haul at their house on Old Pretoria , they headed up North Westover to grab a bite to eat . " Sonic sound good ? " " Anything , " Brooke answered . " I 'm starved . " They pulled into a space at the Sonic Drive-In . This could n't beat Brooke 's fried sweet potatoes and homemade biscuits , but it would do . In the next weeks and months , they 'd have plenty of opportunities to start filling the house with the smells of life and hard work and good home-cookin ' . Grant took Brooke 's request , then hit the red button and waited . A man 's garbled voice : " Good evenin ' . You ready to order ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy on us . " Then , because he could n't help but brag a bit , he added , " I 'm taking over the coaching job at Shiloh Christian . " " The Eagles football team ? " " That 's right . " " Woohoo ! Thank goodness . We 've been waitin ' on ya , Coach Taylor , been prayin ' too . " " You hear that ? " Grant mouthed to his wife . " An answer to their prayers , " she whispered back . Still wearing a silly grin , Grant placed their order . His wife slipped her hand into his . " Guess they know a good thing when they see it , Coach Taylor . " " I guess so . " " Of course , we have n't won any games yet . " " Hey . " " But we will , " she assured him . " Lots of them . " (
