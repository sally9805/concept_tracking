PROLOGUE <p> Once there were four young ladies who sat at the side of every ball , soiree , and party during the London season . Waiting night after night in a row of chairs , the wall- flowers eventually struck up a conversation . They realized that although they were in competition for the same group of gentlemen , there was more to be gained from being friends rather than adversaries . And even more than that , they liked one another . They decided to band together to find husbands , starting with the oldest , Annabelle , and working down to the youngest , Daisy . <p> Annabelle was unquestionably the most beautiful wallflower , but she was virtually penniless , which put her at the greatest disadvantage . Although most London <p> bachelors hoped for a wife with a pretty face , they usually settled for one with a handsome dowry . <p> Evie was unconventionally attractive , with flaming hair and abundant freckles . It was well- known that someday she would inherit a fortune from her father . However , her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , and such a disreputable background was a difficult obstacle for a young lady to surmount . Even worse , Evie was cripplingly shy and had a stammer . Any man who tried to talk to her would later describe the encounter as an act of torture . <p> Lillian and Daisy were sisters from New York . Their family , the Bowmans , were astonishingly , vulgarly , almost unimaginably wealthy , having made their fortune with a soap manufacturing business . They had no good blood , no manners , and no social patrons . Lillian was a fiercely loving friend , but also strong- willed and bossy . And Daisy was a dreamer who often fretted that real life was never quite as interesting as the novels she read so voraciously . <p> As the wallflowers helped one another navigate the perils of London society , and consoled and supported one another through very real dangers , sorrows , and joys , they each found a husband , and no one referred to them as wallflowers anymore . <p> In every social season , however , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as now , there were always girls who were overlooked and ignored by gentlemen who really should have known better . ) <p> But then there was the Christmas when Rafe Bowman , Lillian and Daisy 's oldest brother , came to En gland . After that , life for one London wallflower would never be the same . . . . <p> Excerpted from A Wallflower Christmas by Lisa Kleypas <p> Copyright 2008 by Lisa Kleypas <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
