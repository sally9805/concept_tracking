. A champion angler 's deepest secrets for fishing crankbaits . Jim Berger , a Pennsylvania fisherman , has developed an offbeat method of deep-cranking that absolutely slams walleyes in flowing water . And it 's not a difficult technique to master . Here 's the lowdown on this productive fishing method . DEPTH CHARGES A 30-year walleye fanatic , Berger refined his unique approach while fishing the Ohio , Allegheny and Monon gahela rivers , which join at Pittsburgh . On a typical fishing day , Berger 's crankbaits will dredge up four to five walleyes that weigh between 3 and 4 pounds apiece , not to mention numerous smaller fish whose appetites are almost as big as the jumbo bass lures that Berger favors . In an average year , he lands 8 to 10 walleyes that weigh 8 pounds or more . Berger 's deep-cranking technique is aimed at walleyes that are feeding in moving water from 15 to 25 feet deep . Arm strength is required , because Berger 's fishing approach is physically demanding , sort of like trying to crank an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic rig consists of a 2- to 3-ounce egg sinker 5 feet up the line from a deep-diving walleye crankbait . Essentially , it 's a Carolina rig , except that instead of using a barrel swivel to keep the sinker separated from the lure , Berger pegs the sinker in place with a toothpick . He runs the line through the sinker , around it and then back through the sinker 's hole a second time . Then he pegs it with the toothpick and breaks off the excess . When he gets in position , Berger rockets the heavy combination into the distance with a stiff 7 - foot flipping rod matched with 10-pound-test Berkley FireLine . The superthin line knifes through the water and allows the sinker and crankbait to get deep quickly before the current sweeps them off target and down the river . The heavy sinker can pull any live or artificial bait to the bottom , and Berger has tried every walleye bait or lure in the book . Trial and error has taught him that deep-diving crankbaits catch the most fish . He has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear , and with chartreuse patterns when heavy rains stain or muddy the water . " I think walleyes like crankbaits better than anything else , " says Berger . " The deep divers work best behind a heavy sinker because they really grind the bottom . If you 're looking to catch walleyes in the current , you have to be on the bottom where the fish hold . " Berger discovered his most productive crankbait , the - ounce deep-diving Yo-Zuri Magnum , in a bargain bin at the local outlet of a major sporting-goods chain . Although the lure is considered a bass plug , Berger wanted to go after walleyes big enough to consider the Magnum an average mouthful . So he bought 10 of the plugs . The first time he tried deep-cranking the Magnum behind a heavy weight , the walleyes mauled it . Berger immediately returned to the store and purchased the remaining 15 Yo-Zuri Magnums in the bargain bin . Berger later struck more gold when , in another fishing tackle department , he found a bargain bin that held 48 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might sound like overkill , but Berger regularly snags and loses the crankbaits . He once broke off 16 of them in one day while fishing ( and winning ) a tournament . He cranks dam tailwaters in the winter , points in the spring and fall , water discharges in the summer and any rock-rubble structure he can find on the bottom from spring through fall . TROLL-FREE FISHING Given the amount of effort it takes to cast and retrieve the heavy rig , would n't Berger be better off trolling ? That would be true if he fished larger structures , but most of his targets consist of subtle changes in the bottom . Since he is able to cast across many of these small fishing spots that hold one or two big walleyes , Berger believes casting is more precise and efficient for him than trolling . He always lets the sinker hit the bottom before he begins cranking . This keeps the bait digging the bottom throughout the retrieve . " I 'd rather cast downstream or up stream , because the crankbait dives deeper than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the current sweeps the bait downstream as you retrieve . " Sometimes that 's not such a bad thing , but usually it does n't allow the lure to descend to the depths where the walleyes are . " I keep the crankbait moving along at a pretty good clip , " Berger adds . " Walleyes are n't bashful when they see something they like . " When fishing in the tailwaters of dams , where the current is strongest , Berger must speed up his retrieve to keep pace with the flow . If the bottom is no deeper than 15 feet , he forgoes the weight because the Yo-Zuri Magnum can reach bottom to that depth without any help . Keep in mind , though , that Berger is using fairly light line . Heavier line would keep the lure from achieving its maximum depth . Otherwise , there 's no science to Berger 's approach . He simply motors his boat as close to a dam as possible , quickly grabs his outfit , casts and then reels like crazy . " I idle up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're allowed to get to a dam , " Berger says . " I cast across and slightly upstream and run the crankbait over the bottom as the water swings it down . You have to crank fast to keep the current from overpowering the bait .

First introduced in 1937 , the Jitterbug remains a top seller today in the Pradco family of lures . A convincing mimic of a live frog , the Jitterbug was intended to be fished around shallow weed beds and grassy shorelines . Arguably , it is the most effective night lure for bass ever created  --  lunkers home in on its thrashing side-to-side action and telltale " plip-plop " sound with a vengeance . The example shown is one of the first injection-molded plastic lures ever produced . Earlier Jitterbugs were made from cedar with a scoop-shaped aluminum lip ; during World War II , Alcoa directed all of its aluminum output to the defense effort , and the Jitterbug 's metal lip was replaced temporarily with one made of plastic . Plastic-lipped examples did not perform as well as lures with metal lips but are highly prized by collectors .  --  Don Wirth Author Affiliation <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @        @x They say the wife is always the last to know . <p> Except that Emily Flemming did know and she 'd known for more than a week . Dave , her husband , was involved with someone else . Only Dave was n't just Dave Flemming . He was Pastor Dave Flemming . The thought that her husband loved another woman was intolerable , unthinkable , unbearable . Dave 's betrayal was bad enough , but disregarding his moral obligations to his congregation and his God  --  she could hardly believe it . This shocking secret was completely inconsistent with everything she knew about her husband . <p> Ever since the night of their anniversary dinner , Emily had carefully guarded what she 'd learned . She 'd been in the church office , waiting for Dave , and had reached for his suit jacket , which hung on the back of his door . When she draped it over her arm , a diamond earring had fallen out of the pocket . Later she 'd discovered the second one in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this pair of large , diamond-studded pendant earrings . <p> In the beginning Emily had assumed the earrings were an anniversary present ; however , she quickly realized they could n't be . For one thing , they were n't in a jeweler 's box . But even if they had been , it was n't possible . Dave could never have afforded diamond earrings on their tight family budget . <p> Emily should have asked immediatelyand had n't . She 'd been afraid of ruining their special evening with her suspicions . But almost at once , other details had begun to add up in her mind . She could no longer ignore the fact that Dave so often worked late , especially since the private hour they 'd shared after dinner had gone by the wayside . It might 've been her imagination but he seemed to take extra long with his grooming , too . <p> Her suspicions doubled and tripled . She held them close to her heart , examining them over and over , trying to make sense of her husband 's behavior . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were vague . Another warning sign <p> " Mommy , when 's Daddy coming home ? " Mark , the younger of her two sons , asked as he looked up from his plate . He was eight and his dark brown eyes were identical to his father 's . <p> Emily had the same question . " Soon , " she said as reassuringly as she could . Two or three times a week , Dave did n't get home until well after dinner . At first she 'd made excuses for him to their boys . Now she did n't know what to tell them . <p> " Dad hardly ever eats with us , " Matthew complained , sitting down next to his younger brother . <p> Dave 's lateness had started gradually . He used to make a point of being there for the evening meal . As she stared into space , Emily could n't help wondering if he was having dinner with some other womansome other family . She chased away the thought with a determination that stiffened her spine . <p> For the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your father 's been busy at the church . " <p> " Every night ? " <p> Her sons echoed Emily 's own dissatisfaction . " It seems so , " she returned lightly , pretending all was well as she joined them at the dinner table . They automatically clasped hands and bowed their heads while Emily recited grace . Silently she added a prayer for herself , asking for courage to face whatever the future might hold for her marriage . <p> " Should n't we wait for him at least one night ? " Mark said as he reluctantly picked up his fork . <p> " You two have homework , do n't you ? " she asked , ignoring his question . <p> " But Dad  --  " <p> " Your father will eat later . " <p> " Will he get home before we go to bed ? " Matthew , her sensitive son , asked . <p> " I do n't know , " she said , swallowing hard . <p> She made a pretense of eating . Her appetite had disappeared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start  --  the wake-up call she 'd ignored for months . Naturally , she 'd told herself , there could be any number of explanations for those earrings . She 'd intended to ask him about it the very next dayand had n't . <p> Emily knew what held her back . She did n't want to hear the truth ; she simply was n't ready for it . She dreaded the consequences once she did finally confront him . <p> She 'd questioned her husband , more than once , about his late nights . But Dave brushed aside her concern and offered ambiguous excuses , mentioning people she 'd never met and meetings she did n't know about . He almost seemed to resent her asking , so after a while she 'd stopped . <p> She supposed she had her answer . Since the discovery of the diamond earrings , she had a perfectly clear picture of what was happening  --  what had already happened . Sadly , pastors were as susceptible to temptation as anyone else . Like all sinners , they , too , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make irreparable mistakes . <p> If Emily had hoped this was just a misunderstanding , that she 'd allowed it to grow out of all proportion in her mind , those hopes had been destroyed . Earlier in the week , she 'd run into Bob and Peggy Beldon at the grocery store . They owned the local bed-and-breakfast , Thyme and Tide . As the three of them stood in the middle of the aisle exchanging pleasantries , Bob casually said that he missed playing golf with Dave . <p> As long as the weather permitted , the two of them had played weekly for the past three years . In a matter of minutes , she 'd ferreted out the information she 'd been afraid to learn . Dave had given up golfing more than a year ago . A year ! Yet every week last summer , he 'd loaded up his golf clubs on Monday afternoons and driven off , supposedly to meet Bob . Obviously he 'd been meeting someone else . <p> Emily sighed . She could n't continue to let her mind wander down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she acted the role of the quiet , unassuming wife ; the rest of the time it was all she could do to refrain from demanding an explanation . She wanted the truth no matter how painful it might be  --  and yet she did n't . What wife ever did ? <p> So far she 'd remained silent . She was astonished by how good she 'd become at pretending everything was fine . None of her friends suspected . What bothered her almost as much as her suspicions was the fact that Dave did n't seem to have any idea that she 'd caught on . She wondered if he 'd broach the subject . Maybe if he knew she 'd figured out what was going on Perhaps that was what she 'd been waiting for . She wanted him to ask her . <p> But Dave never asked . If she managed to put on a marvelous performance , then so did her husband . Last Sunday he 'd actually spoken from the pulpit about the importance of marriage , of loving one 's spouse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could barely stop herself from breaking into heart-wrenching sobs right there in front of the entire congregation . Naturally everyone must have assumed she 'd been overcome with emotion , since Dave 's sermon , by implication , had honored her . She wanted to tell them that , beautiful though his words were , that was all they were . Words . <p> It was hard to believe this could be happening to them . Emily had always been so sure they had a solid marriage , and that Dave was her best friend . Apparently she was wrong . <p> The door leading to the garage opened and to her surprise he walked into the house . <p> " Dad ! " Mark slid out of his chair , running toward his father as if he had n't seen him in a year . <p> " Hey there , little man , how 's it going ? " Dave reached down and swung their son into his arms . Mark was too big to be picked up like a child , but he craved the attention from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ruffled Matthew 's hair before he sat down . " I 'm glad I made it home in time for dinner tonight . " <p> " Me , too , " Mark said , his eyes glowing . <p> Despite everything , her own happiness sprang to life again , and Emily got up and brought a fourth place setting to the table . <p> When she passed him the enchilada casserole she 'd made , he took a heaping serving , then grinned over at her . " You fixed one of my favorites , " he said . " Thank you . " <p> " You 're welcome . " She met his look , letting him know with her eyes how much she loved him . Maybe , regardless of the evidence , all her unhappy suspicions were wrong . <p> " Can you help me with my homework after dinner , Dad ? " Mark asked . <p> Their younger son was the top student in his class , far ahead of the other second-graders . He did n't need any assistance . What he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You promised to throw me the football , remember ? " Matthew said . Never mind that it was late November and already dark outside , <p> He , too , wanted time with Dave . The children were n't the only ones ; Emily needed all the reassurance he had to offer . Hard as she tried to cast aside these doubts , they refused to die . She did n't want to lose her husband . She loved Dave no matter what and was determined to keep her marriage together  --  or at least make every possible effort . <p> " Hold on , hold on . " Dave laughingly raised both hands . " Give me a minute to catch my breath , would you ? " <p> Both boys stared expectantly at their father . Emily could n't bear to look at their eager faces . Seeing the love for him in their eyes made her feel like weeping . <p> " Let your dad eat his dinner , " she said . <p> " After that , I 'll help you both , but I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dave said , glancing at Emily . <p> A chill raced down her spine , and she was afraid to meet his eyes . <p> " Aw , Dad , " Mark whined . <p> " It wo n't take long , " he promised . " Eat your green beans . " <p> " Okay . " <p> Emily handed Dave the bowl of buttered beans with sliced almonds . He took a small portion . Green beans were n't his favorite vegetable , either , and this was her way of suggesting he set a good example . <p> Following dinner , the boys cleared the table , then went to their room for study hour . This had been Dave 's idea . Whether they had homework or not , Matthew and Mark were to spend one hour every night reading , writing or reviewing their schoolwork . The television was n't allowed to be on , nor were video games permitted . <p> As the boys trudged to their room , Emily made a pot of coffee , keeping her back to Dave as she worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . If there was something on his mind , he generally discussed it with her after the boys had gone to bed . <p> Even before she could finish pouring their coffee , Dave asked her , " Are you happy ? " His voice was urgent . Intense . The need to know seemed to burn inside him . <p> Dozens of possible questions had occurred to her , but this was one she had n't expected . <p> " Happy ? " she repeated , facing him . Still not meeting his gaze , she carried two steaming mugs of coffee to the table and set them down . " Am I happy ? " She shoved her hands in the back pockets of her faded jeans as she contemplated her response . <p> " I did n't think it would take you this long to answer , " Dave said . His dark eyes studied her and he seemed disappointed in her hesitation . <p> " Is there a reason I should n't be happy ? " she asked , turning the question back on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm able to stay home with the boys the way we both wanted . My husband is madly in love with me , right ? " she added , remembering his sermon from the Sunday before  --  and hoping she did n't sound even slightly sarcastic . Without giving him the opportunity to answer , perhaps because she feared what he might say , she asked , " What about you , Dave ? Are you happy ? " <p> " Of course I am . " His reply was immediate and impassioned . <p> " Then I am , too . " Rather than join him at the table she started to load the dishwasher . <p> " Sit down , " he said . " Please . " <p> Reluctantly she did . <p> " You have n't been sleeping well . " <p> So he 'd noticed . She fell asleep easily enough , but an hour or two later she 'd be wide awake . Then for the rest of the night she 'd toss and turn , sleeping fitfully if at all . The scenarios that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . Her husband might be in love with someone else . He might even be cheating on her . <p> Emily considered herself an emotionally strong woman , one who remained calm in a crisis . A woman others counted on for guidance and support . Yet when it came to confronting her husband with her suspicions , she was a coward . <p> " If there 's something bothering you , maybe I can help , " he said . She recognized his tone , that caring , concerned voice he so often used with others . Only she was n't just one of his parishioners , she was his wife ! <p> " What could possibly be bothering me ? " she asked airily . She did n't expect him to answer . <p> " I do n't know . That 's why I 'm asking . Are the ladies from the missionary society making too many demands ? " <p> " No . " The cookbook committee had wanted her to organize the entire project and she 'd told them she simply did n't have the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a few ruffled feathers . The church family seemed to think that because Emily did n't work outside the home , she should be at their beck and call , just like Dave . Emily had no intention of becoming an unpaid employee of the church and had made that clear when they accepted the assignment in Cedar Cove . Her role was to support Dave and mother their young sons . <p> " You 'd tell me if you were upset , would n't you ? " <p> " Of course , " she said , hoping the act of sipping coffee would hide her lie . <p> Mark stuck his head inside the kitchen . " Are you finished talking to Mom yet ? " he asked his father . " I need help with my math . " <p> Dave looked at her . <p> " I 'm fine , " she said emphatically . <p> He seemed to doubt her . She was n't expert at lying and hated the fact that she was afraid to voice her concerns . Dave took a sip of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show me what 's giving you trouble . " <p> Emily watched her husband and son walk out of the kitchen and swallowed painfully . She 'd been waiting for him to ask her a question like that . Are you happy ? It was the perfect opportunity to address her suspicions  --  but she 'd been too frightened to say anything . <p> The problem , she told herself , was that she was n't prepared . For her own protection , she needed facts and details before she confronted him . He needed to realize she was n't as naive as he obviously thought . <br> Continues ...
