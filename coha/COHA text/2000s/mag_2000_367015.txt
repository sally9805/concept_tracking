But shortly they will have another medium on which to glimpse his visage . To commemorate PRINCE WILLIAM 's 18th birthday ( June 21 ) , the post office on the British island of Jersey will issue stamps featuring the fetching royal against a variety of backdrops . They will " show his sporting side , and the fireworks represent a celebration at his coming of age , " says philatelic artist William Wall . One stamp 's backdrop was supposed to show Caernarvon Castle , where William 's father was invested as Prince of Wales . But another fortress is pictured in error .

Currently , she lives in New York and is working on a novel , a pursuit she was forced to suspend last week to contend with the flood of flower deliveries and phone calls .

In years to come , the most prestigious scholarship will surely be the Seinfeld . Participating in a program known as Principal for a Day at La Guardia High School in New York City last week , the comedian announced that the JERRY SEINFELD Family and Scholarship Foundation would pay tuition and expenses for five of the school 's seniors to attend college next year . He plans to continue the program , with recipients chosen each year according to talent and need .
