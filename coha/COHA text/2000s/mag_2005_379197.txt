In a way , I guess you can call my life stressful , chaotic and filled with hard work . When taking a look at it all , I see past this and notice how fortunate I am to have not only a mother and a father but food every day and a roof over my head . I am sure that even in my most stressful moments , I have it easier than more than half the world . Still , I find it ironic writing about how occupied my schedule is when I barely have enough time to write . <P> I am a very active person and always find myself running from one event to another . My top priorities are school , athletics and my family . Cross-country , track and gymnastics are some of the sports I am committed to . During the cross-country and track seasons , I have practice Monday through Friday , mostly at 7:30 a.m . I love running so much that I run on my own too . I am also a Level Six USA Gymnastics competitor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never get a break . I do n't mind this , and I look forward to practices , which are three hours , three times a week . The one thing I dislike about running and gymnastics is when they conflict . It pains me whenever I have to choose between them . <P> I also take school extremely seriously . I am a straight-A student and am looking to keep this up . Unlike many parents , mine do not get angry if I get a grade lower than an A. They simply advise me to go talk to my teachers to find out if there is any work I could do to bring the grade up . I 'm thankful for this type of parenting because it seems as though I get enough criticism from myself . <P> Another love that I have is music . I play the clarinet in my school 's highest band , the wind ensemble . Last summer I took piano lessons for my own pleasure . I caught on to this instrument quickly , and I play it as much as possible  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also love taking part in our school plays . This year I was given a role in Anything Goes , which was a thrilling experience . Rehearsals occurred almost every day after school for about two months . During this time , it was difficult to fit in cross-country , gymnastics , piano and homework . Yet somehow I did . On those rare occasions when I am left with a free moment , one of my favorite things to do is relax in a comfortable chair and read a novel . <P> One of my greatest struggles is trying to find time to spend with my family and friends on top of all of my activities . I hate that something has to be sacrificed . For me , that thing is my friends . At times my friends get angry with me because I can never hang out with them . This annoys me because I do n't think they know how much I really want to but ca n't because of my time constraints . I wish they knew that I miss them . I also long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Now I come home from meets and practices to eat and finish homework . Many times I am exhausted . <P> It may sound as though there must be something or someone making me live my life in this manner . Well , there is : me . I choose to spend my time this way , even though it may mean less time for friends , family and relaxing . Call me crazy , but the reason for my overscheduled lifestyle is the love I have for all my chosen activities . Just like with my schooling , I have long-term goals for the sports with which I am involved . Those goals drive me to keep up the hard work . I enjoy what I do and am not planning to stop anytime soon .
