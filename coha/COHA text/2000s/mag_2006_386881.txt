Where do I belong ? Why do I feel stuck ? What am I meant to be doing with my life ? Editor-at-Large DIANE WEATHERS talks to three women who found unexpected answers to the questions we all have . And spiritual gurus SERITA JAKES and JOYCE MEYER reflect on finding life 's deeper meaning // Shantrelle P. Lewis hated telling people she was a schoolteacher . A graduate of Howard University , she had reluctantly taken a position teaching science at a Washington , D.C. , high school . She needed the job to help pay the bills while she worked the weekend overnight shift as a DJ at a local hip-hop radio station . As she saw it , the teaching job was temporary . It provided neither the income nor the status she sought in her professional life . " I figured it was just a matter of time until my radio gig blew up , and I would become a huge star , " says the 28-year-old New Orleans native . " I had such big dreams , and I felt that teaching was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all those kids in her ninth-grade classroom with issues . So many of them had been marked by poverty , abuse and neglect , and they gave no thought at all to their future . Most of the time the kids just made Shantrelle feel tired . She had a persistent sense of waiting for her real life , the one that truly counted , to begin . Shantrelle Lewis 's story is not unusual . Many of us long to push through the obstacles , distractions and obligations that seem to keep us stuck . We long to discover our unique role in the universe , the thing we were placed on this earth to do . Deep down we might believe that there is an exceptional purpose for our lives , important work we are meant to do , human connections we are meant to make , but we do n't know how to get from where we are right now to where we think we should be . Finding your life 's purpose can take some trial and error , says Valorie Burton , a Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Back ? ( WaterBrook Press ) . " When you are truly living on purpose , you 're using your gifts , talents and experience to make a positive difference in the world , " she explains . She adds that learning how to lead a useful life usually means getting off the treadmill , getting still , and seeking clarity about the steps needed to realize your dream . As the three women profiled here discovered , a life lived on purpose forces you to step out of your own small space and be of service to something bigger than yourself . The reward is the joy and energy you feel when you love what you do and you 're leading a life rich with meaning . Choosing What Matters Mehret Mandefro 's professors and mentors thought she was making a big mistake . They told her she was wasting her blue-chip education . With her undergraduate degree from Harvard University , a degree in medicine from the Harvard Medical School and a stint in London on a Fulbright Scholarship , Mehret could have had her pick of residencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also expected to choose one of the more financially lucrative specialties , such as cardiology , pediatrics or radiology . But Mehret , 30 , decided to ignore everyone else 's plan for her life and follow her own heart . It led her to accept a residency at Montefiore Medical Center , a large hospital in New York City 's South Bronx , and to choose a specialty in primary care . Montefiore serves a largely African-American and Latino population plagued by ailments rife among some of the urban poor : substance abuse , high rates of teenage pregnancy and a high incidence of mortality from AIDS . Mehret , who was born in Ethiopia and moved with her family to northern Virginia when she was a child , concedes that her work can be emotionally draining . Yet she says the experience offers her everything she wanted-and more . " Fm working with the community that most needs my skills , " she explains . " The range of the diseases I 'm able to treat helps my research in public health , and I 'm blessed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine in bettering our society . " Following what others say you should be doing rather than heeding the call of your heart is a classic roadblock to living a purposeful life , says Sue Hodgkinson , a Boston executive coach and author of The Leader 's Edge ( iUniverse , Inc . ) . The first step to getting past the roadblock is to get clear about what matters most to you-not what should matter or what others think is important . Hodgkinson points out that when we stop paying so much attention to the shoulds , the stagnation and frustration that we often feel in our careers and personal lives begin to melt away . " When you heed your inner calling , both you and the people around you benefit , " she says . " You become more focused , more grounded and less easily ruffled . You also become a very positive source of energy to others and a leader people will want to follow . " Now in the final year of her residency at Montefiore , Mehret 's insistence on letting her heart guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded research stints in Botswana and South Africa to study the link between gender inequity and AIDS , and she 's raising money to build an AIDS clinic in Ethiopia . " If you really want to move forward in life and advance spiritually , " she reflects , " you have to connect your personal story to a larger one . " The Journey Within Single with no children , Ruth Elmore enjoyed her work as a consultant to a health-care company in Baltimore , but she knew that something was missing . So she packed her schedule beyond full : her college sorority and alumni association , Toastmasters , the Leukemia Society , church and professional groups and the college students she mentored . The list went on . She seldom made it home on weekdays before 10:00 P.M. , and she was gaining weight from always eating fast food on the run . She was burned out , tired all the time and most of all , unhappy . " I was just doing and doing for no reason , " she now says . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2004 , when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . During the weeks she spent undergoing chemotherapy and radiation and recuperating at home , the 41-year-old was forced to examine her life . She recalls lying in bed one day and thinking , This is not howlwant to live . She started her search for meaning by journaling regularly , taking note of her thoughts and feelings . " I began to understand that your purpose is what drives your life , " she says . " I am here for a reason . " Ruth began paring down the involvements that had filled her days and cut back on the volunteer work and board memberships that had taken over her evenings . She now spends more time on outdoor activities she used to enjoy while growing up : Two weeks after her chemotherapy treatment ended , she went on her first mountain-climbing trek . She has since gone camping , taken up tennis and bicycling , and has joined a gym . In between all that activity , she regularly makes time to give thanks for her life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of her journey . Taking time for self-reflection and self-nurturing is an essential step in discovering the purpose in our lives , says Audra Bohannon , the Boston coauthor of Illuminating the Spirit : Inviting Energy and Change Into Your Life ( Pushkin Group ) . " Most of us take ten minutes at New Year 's to make a toast or a resolution and that 's it , " she says . " The rest of the year we do n't reflect , we just do . Instead of being intentional , we focus on other people 's demands . Their wants and needs take priority . " This failure to regularly invest time to identify and meet our own needs costs us dearly . " Not only do you end up moving through the world not connected to your purpose , " Bohannon points out , " you also are not connected to who you are . " But when you become willing to look within , she says , you discern clues to how you should be living your life and where you should direct your energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she saw her next step clearly : She wanted more than anything to parent a child . She has since become part of a sister circle , a group of ten women who meet monthly to support one another in achieving their personal goals . And with all traces of her cancer gone , Ruth is now raising a child who is in foster care . She has this advice for others seeking to live purposefully : " You have to take care of yourself first . Only then can you truly give to others . " Seeing Your Life Anew Shantrelle Lewis was counting the days until her big break as a major hip-hop DJ , despite the fact that her overnight radio gig paid hardly anything , and larger stations had yet to come knocking on her door . In the meantime , she continued her day job teaching science to high-school students , often talking with them about ways to avoid the pitfalls of their drug- and crime-ridden neighborhoods . She was still waiting for hip-hop stardom to find her when she was offered a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately she noticed that educating her students about the ancient kingdoms of West Africa and the heroes of African-American history made them feel better about themselves . " I was helping them make connections between the greatness of our ancestors and our potential greatness today , " she says . Her students were n't the only ones being transformed . Shantrelle 's vision of her own future began to change radically . " I realized I had a gift for teaching and a passion for our history , " she says . " I am an educator . Yet that was something I had never considered for myself . In my mind , it was n't even an option . " Life coach Burton observes that , starting when we 're very young , we should be encouraged to pay attention to what stirs our passion or taps into our unique gifts . Instead , our material culture urges us to pursue whatever sells . " Young people are often raised to look at what the marketplace is pushing or what popular culture says they should find fulfilling , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed a high value on fame and wealth . " With my generation , everything is about instant gratification and celebrity status , " she says . " We internalize the message that what matters most is how much money you have , not whether you are making a positive contribution to your community . " Shantrelle has since changed her mind about hiphop stardom . Close to completing a master 's degree in African-American studies at Temple University , she plans to pursue a Ph.D . so that she can teach at the college level . Meanwhile she 's working in the education department at Philadelphia 's African-American Museum , where she has organized a collective of scholars , activists and professionals to support the institution and the community it represents . " I believe that whatever your passion is , however ordinary it may seem at first , the greatest satisfaction comes when you pursue it and use it for the highest good , " she says .
