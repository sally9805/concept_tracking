Excerpts from newspaper editorials from the United States and abroad : <p> Dec. 10 <p> Texarkana ( Texas ) Gazette , on agreement to create Afghan government : <p> The promise of billions of dollars for their country obviously nudged them along , and there is no guarantee that their best intentions will not be waylaid by recalcitrant warlords , but the four Afghan factions that signed a pact in Germany this week deserve congratulations for what they have accomplished . <p> In just a few weeks , these representatives of frequently antagonistic ethnic groups agreed to establish an interim government in which these groups and others will be represented . They agreed to the presence in Afghanistan of an international peacekeeping force , and , by naming two women as ministers , they moved to end the oppression of women in their land . <p> They have thus laid the groundwork for a second interim government to be created in six months , leading to elections and a permanent government within two years . <p> There are dangers ahead . Some Northern Alliance leaders are said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done any of the fighting , and even if they put aside their objections , the new government will have to cope with astonishing poverty and a perilous lack of order . ... <p> A next promised step - the funneling by Western nations of billions of dollars into the country - can help alleviate its misery this coming year and build a solid economic structure for the long-term future . <p> It is a far way from happening , but the miracle at the end of the day could be that America 's war on terrorism not only destroyed networks of evildoers who would otherwise have continued the murdering of thousands , but also helped rescue Afghanistan from tyranny and unspeakable destitution . That is a hope made more nearly possible by the Afghan negotiators . <p> Dec. 11 <p> Evansville ( Ind . ) Courier &; Press , on the bin Laden tape : <p> Now that the White House has confirmed the existence of a video of Osama bin Laden discussing the Sept. 11 attacks , it should make the video public , especially if the tape truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt about bin Laden 's guilt . <p> The Bush administration has several reservations about releasing the tape . The president fears giving bin Laden more publicity , but if the contents of the tape are as described , they do nothing to promote his cause . <p> Another objection is that the tape might compromise sources and methods , but the White House need not disclose how it came into possession of the tape . The Washington Post said it turned up in a search of a private house in Jalalabad , Afghanistan . The White House worries that the Muslim world might not believe a tape released by the White House is authentic . A certain hard-core faction in the Muslim world will believe what it wants , regardless of any evidence . But for our allies among the Muslim nations and elsewhere , the tape could be further proof that the al-Qaida conspiracy is genuine . <p> Dec. 11 <p> Chicago Tribune , on growing support for American Muslims : <p> On Sept. 11 , 19 foreigners from Middle Eastern countries , acting in the name of Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans that killed thousands of people . So in the last three months , Americans have shown a new distrust and dislike of Muslims . Right ? Well , no . A new survey makes it clear that whatever else the public has done in response to the terrorist attacks , it has not blamed them on all Muslims . <p> In the past , Americans might have initially reacted with anger and prejudice against the minority group whose members were responsible , and only later repented of indiscriminate scapegoating . But this time , perhaps heeding the plea of President Bush and other leaders , Americans immediately recognized that these atrocities were the bloody work of individuals - not of entire religions or ethnic groups . <p> According to a new poll conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People &; the Press , most people have not taken a more negative view of Muslims than before the attacks - they 've taken a more positive view . In March , 45 percent of Americans expressed a positive opinion of Muslims . In November , 59 percent reported a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfavorable view . By contrast , only 32 percent of those polled look favorably on atheists . ... <p> Compare this experience with the treatment of ethnic Japanese during World War II . Some 120,000 of them were placed in internment camps , losing jobs , homes and businesses in the process . Many spent most of the war there . ... <p> " Wartime cartoons and posters routinely depicted the Japanese as murderous savages , immature children , wild beasts , or buck-toothed , bespectacled lunatics , " writes historian David Kennedy . " The long record of racialist disdain made it easy to demonize the Japanese . " <p> The ethnic transformation of American society has led to changes in racial attitudes over the last 60 years - changes so fundamental that they can withstand even strong countervailing pressures . Three months ago , a lot of people worried that Americans would succumb to their worst impulses . Instead , the war against terrorism has shown them at their best . <p> Dec. 4 <p> Carlsbad ( N.M. ) Current-Argus , on the death penalty and extradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death penalty . Capital punishment is an issue in which reasonable people can differ . <p> But Spain is going a bit far in refusing to extradite eight suspected terrorists because the United States may execute them for their involvement in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . Other European nations holding terrorism suspects - including Germany , England and Italy - may follow suit . This is unfortunate for the effort to destroy terrorist networks . <p> The countries of the world should not let differences over issues of punishment get in the way of prosecuting evildoers . <p> At the same time , the United States must be realistic . It 's doubtful that many of these European nations will back down on the death penalty issue , so concessions will have to be made . <p> The Bush administration is already working toward a compromise so the United States can gain custody of terrorism suspects held in Europe . <p> One likely scenario is that the United States may make a promise not to execute suspects who are not directly associated with the attacks . But if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison sentences . <p> While it 's regrettable that the extradition of terrorism suspects may be conditional , it 's more important the United States gain custody of the evildoers . The last thing we need now is a big debate over the death penalty . <p> Dec. 10 <p> Amarillo ( Texas ) Globe-News , on John Walker , the American Taliban : <p> John Philip Walker appears to be a troubled young man . He also appears to be a traitor who took up arms with an enemy force with whom the nation of his birth is at war . <p> So , why the apparent angst among some Americans over what to do about this young man ? <p> Walker , 20 , was captured the other day by U.S. forces fighting in Afghanistan . Several years ago , he converted to Islam and then joined the Taliban . ... <p> Walker suffered serious shrapnel wounds during a fierce firefight at a prison holding Taliban fighters . He now is in U.S. custody and is recovering from his wounds . <p> What should happen to him ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal courts on a charge of treason . He deserves only the consideration to which he is entitled as a U.S. citizen , namely a fair and public trial . <p> If the court convicts him , then he deserves the sentence that the court deems warranted . If that sentence is death , then the government is obligated to carry it out . <p> However , let us not waste time wondering - and worrying - about how this young man could turn on his country . The judicial system must decide whether he did and determine the price he must pay . <p> Dec. 11 <p> The Philadelphia Inquirer on Enron 's failure : <p> For thousands of laid-off Enron Corp . employees who lost up to 90 percent of their retirement savings in the company 's collapse , it was the fiscal equivalent of one of those horrific nightclub fires of old . <p> Rushing for the exits , trying to save their imploding 401(k) plans , staffers found that all the exits were locked . <p> They were barred from selling off their retirement plans ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . <p> So as the smoke begins to clear following last week 's bankruptcy filing , one of the largest ever , the sense of outrage on behalf of Enron 's laid-off workers only grows . <p> It 's not just that these employees ' savings vaporized in the last few weeks . It 's that others higher up the Enron food chain were spared . Enron executives and some 500 key staffers were rewarded with millions in bonuses and special payments while the company stock tanked . ... In other words , Enron movers and shakers were guided to the fire escapes . <p> Back at the rubble of the Enron disaster , recovery teams from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department had better find out why those exits were barred to so many at Enron . <p> Enron workers ' retirement accounts were frozen by the company for much of October and November . Normally , such freezes are permitted only during a change in plan administrators . <p> In Enron 's case , federal investigators need to find out whether the freeze was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ... <p> Enron staffers got into trouble by being so heavily invested in their own company . Without diversification , their 401(k) plans took a huge hit when Enron plunged . The same could happen at many major companies where , on average , 30 percent of holdings are in company stock . <p> Companies encourage such holdings to create a sense of shared stake in the corporate future . That 's fine . But savvy 401(k) investors should scatter their nest-egg funds . It 's not being disloyal , merely prudent . <p> The scale of the Enron disaster argues for Congress to fix some emerging flaws in one of its most popular creations , the 401(k) : for example , capping the amount of company stock an employee can be required to hold in a 401(k) . Such guidelines - so far resisted by major employers - could have been a lifeline at Enron . <p> Dec. 11 <p> The Palm Beach ( Fla . ) Post , on baseball 's troubles : <p> Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig 's appearance before Congress last week ostensibly was about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , it was about keeping Mr. Selig 's bosses - the team owners - from shutting down Minnesota 's team . ... <p> The exemption blocks cities and states from suing Mr. Selig 's bosses when they do what they please , so they fight to defend it and against Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth 's request for information about their plans to expel the Marlins and Tampa Bay Devil Rays . ... <p> Mr. Selig pleaded poverty . He testified that only two teams in a $3.5 billion-a-year market made money in the past seven years , that collectively baseball lost $519 million last year , that the sport has deep debt . The players ' union did n't help his cause by saying his financial reports hide money . Minnesota Gov . Jesse Ventura piled on . He called the poor-mouthing " asinine " in view of what the owners pay the hired hands . When Mr. Selig testified that the last sale of a major-league franchise was Kansas City in 1996 , a committee member had to remind him of Los Angeles in 1998 and Cleveland in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Asinine or not , Mr. Selig will have done his job if the result of the hearing is to save the exemption , even if it means a brief reprieve for the Minnesota Twins . Football and basketball do n't have it . Baseball should n't . Times have changed . ... <p> Dec. 9 <p> The Times-Picayune , New Orleans , on honoring the heroes of World War II : <p> For the soldiers who threw themselves onto grenades so that their buddies might live ... <p> For those who charged head-on toward enemy pillboxes and machine gun nests when death seemed to be the only logical conclusion ... <p> For the medics who risked their lives to treat soldiers who lay bleeding on the field ... <p> For the pilots who chose to stay in the air and take out the enemy rather than land and refuel ... <p> For the men who surged forward when retreating would have been excusable ... <p> For those whose actions demonstrated that the amount of selflessness , courage and dedication the human heart can hold is incalculable ... <p> For each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty " ... <p> The Medals of Honor you were awarded for service in World War II expressed the government 's appreciation . The unveiling of the Pacific wing of the National D-Day Museum and the accompanying military parade in downtown New Orleans expressed the appreciation of the people who have benefited from your bravery . <p> The sacrifices all of you made are the reasons we enjoy the freedoms we have today . <p> Thank you . <p> Dec. 12 <p> Corriere della Sera , Milan , Italy , on anti-terrorism and civil liberties : <p> When the Cold War ended , most of the world 's democracies cut military spending . With no real enemy to target , their intelligence services stopped monitoring " ordinary citizens " and started focusing on industrial espionage instead . <p> Governments gave the private sector , civil society , human and environmental rights groups more space to act in areas that were once off-limits to all but the state . <p> With the passing of the ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center-stage - the right to privacy , the rights of women and children , the humane treatment of animals and the scrapping of Third World debt . <p> But in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks , the state has reconquered lost ground . The United States scrapped the right to a fair trail in court cases dealing with immigration . President George W. Bush banned several Islamic charity organizations without providing evidence of their alleged wrongdoing . The British government has authorized detention without trial for indefinite periods . The European Union has rushed to adopt wide-ranging international arrest warrant measures . <p> The fight against terrorism is not an excuse to curb civil rights . <p> Dec. 12 <p> Business Day , Johannesburg , South Africa , on Zimbabwe and the regional economy : <p> Not for the first time , the Southern African Development Community minister 's delegation that met in Harare on Monday and yesterday was out-maneuvered by ( Zimbabwe ) President Robert Mugabe 's embattled government . In the end , it spent more time expressing solidarity with Harare than focusing on the root causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsening malaise . <p> The opportunity for the SADC to help the people of Zimbabwe was lost once again because the delegation allowed Harare 's bombastic foreign minister , Stan Mudenge , to make the outrageous opening statement that there could be " no sanctions smart enough to affect Zimbabweans alone . " <p> The SADC should take the cue from President Thabo Mbeki and insist on the presidential election being free and fair . <p> Further , the body must expose the real meaning behind Mudenge 's assertion that the region 's " destinies are intertwined - by driving home the point that the anarchy in Zimbabwe is indeed negatively affecting all the countries in the region by discouraging tourism and investment . <p> Dec. 12 <p> De Volkskrant , Amsterdam , Netherlands , on the European Union and Arafat : <p> The European Union has called on Palestinian leader Arafat to break up the " terrorist networks " Hamas and the Islamic Jihad . <p> Following the United States , Europe has also increased pressure on Arafat . <p> Just or unjust , Arafat is now considered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace talks can continue . Arafat is still seen as the man who is able to curb Hamas and the Islamic Jihad , although this is getting increasingly difficult . <p> We can ask Arafat to halt the terror , but on the Israeli side there also must be steps taken to make that possible . <p> The EU justly points out that Israel has to stop the execution-without-trial of persons who are suspected of terrorist activities . Also , Israel needs to withdraw from Palestinian autonomous areas and has to lift the blockades . <p> The recommendations from the EU are a first step . <p> But eventually the U.S. has the power and influence to bring peace to the region . At this moment , the U.S. waits for others to make moves . If Arafat follows the call from the EU , the U.S. can put pressure on Sharon to seriously start negotiations with the Palestinians . <p> Dec. 12 <p> As-Safir , Beirut , Lebanon , on the European Union and Arafat : <p> If one is to learn anything from the EU stance , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations two great and dangerous myths : <p> The first and clearest myth is thinking we can depend on a European position that balances the American position , or one that influences it to our advantage or to the advantage of what 's right and just , or a kind of new cold war , however mild . <p> The second and deeper myth , is thinking that we can rely on " the international community " and " world conscience " and " the sense of justice and fairness " to compensate for our weakness . ... <p> The fall of the second myth should teach us that the " international community " is nothing but a grouping of interests ... the title for the strong and powerful winners , and we and our partisans are not one of them . ... <p> When was the last time that this " international community " that we appeal to for justice made us feel that we were needed , that it was in need of our status , our resources and our markets ? We should teach ourselves that in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody cares about you . <p> Why do we confirm our need for others every day , when they are not in need of us ? <p> Dec. 6 <p> Asahi Shimbun , Tokyo , on Enron 's failure : <p> Enron 's downfall was triggered by revelations of the huge losses sustained by its off-the-books partnerships . They prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to investigate . <p> The global economy is still reeling from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington . Enron 's fall should not become yet another disruptive element in an already shaken international economic environment . <p> If Japan 's policy-makers can draw any lesson from Enron 's failure , it is that it is dangerous to treat energy - an essential for the economy and for daily life - as a financial product . <p> Liberalizing the market for electricity requires an exchange to buy and sell it . Such an exchange would inevitably draw swarms of investors willing to bet on making a quick profit . But the main players should be the operators of power plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its sad ending much like the California energy crisis , offers some precious lessons for Japan 's architects of power-industry liberalization . <p> Dec. 9 <p> The Independent , London , on the course of the war against terrorism : <p> The collapse of the odious Taliban regime in Afghanistan is a highly welcome development . However , it is only one part of the so-called war against terrorism . At such moments , when fearful gloom and despondency risk being replaced by premature triumphalism , it is worth recalling the original aims of the war . Osama bin Laden remains free and the real work of winding up al-Qa'eda is only beginning . <p> More importantly , both Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair made a much wider claim for their offensive . This was a war against terrorism across the globe , at the end of which the world would be a safer place . The terrible events in the Middle East show that this is still a distant goal and may even have moved further away . ... <p> At its worst , such rhetoric provides cover for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now claiming to be fighting its own war against terrorism in response to the Hamas attacks of last week . A response to the atrocities is inevitable , but the Sharon government 's decision to use the attacks as an excuse to attempt the fatal undermining of the Palestinian Authority is not . Mr. Bush can hardly complain when he has used the same language to explain his response to 11 September . ... <p> The fall of the Taliban , it turns out , was relatively easy to secure . ... The easy military success has fed the appetite in the U.S. for an outright assault on Iraq at the earliest possible opportunity . <p> That would endanger the international coalition and reap further havoc in an already unstable region . We must proceed with great caution here . Phase one of the war may be over . The dangers are not .
