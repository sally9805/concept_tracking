Gift from Heaven // They saw in the arms of this princess whom they had watched suffer great persecutions with so much staunchness , their child-King , like a gift given by Heaven in answer to their prayers . //  --  Madame de Motteville , M ? moires // The first woman in the life of Louis XIV  --  and probably the most important  --  was his mother , Anne of Austria . When Louis , her first child , was born on 5 September 1638 the Spanish-born Queen of France was just short of her thirty-seventh birthday . This was an age at which a royal princess might well expect to be a grandmother ( Anne herself had been married at fourteen ) . The Queen had on the contrary endured twenty-two years of childless union . Anne , as she told a confidante , had even feared the annulment of her marriage , since childlessness was one possible ground for repudiation according to the Catholic Church . In which case the former Spanish Princess , daughter of Philip III , would either have been returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Spanish ? Netherlands ( approximately modern Belgium ) , as other princesses of her royal house had done , most recently her pious aunt , Isabella Clara Eugenia. // The birth of a child , and that child a son  --  females could not inherit in France under the fourteenth-century Salic Law  --  meant that the whole position of his royal mother was transformed . It was not only the obvious delight of a woman confronted with ? a marvel when it was least expected ? , as the official newspaper Gazette de France put it . It was also the traditionally strong position of any Queen of France who had produced a Dauphin , an interesting paradox in the land of the Salic Law . This strength derived from the claim of such a Queen to act as Regent should her husband die during the minority of her son ; a rule which had applied to Louis XIII ? s mother when Henri IV had died , and the dominating Catherine de M ? dicis in the previous century . // It was a situation that had already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrothal in 1612 . In poetical language the future Queen was described as the moon to her husband ? s sun : ? Just as the moon borrows its light from the sun . . . ? the monarch ? s death means that ? the setting sun gives way to the moon and confers on it the power of shedding light in its absence ? . ( The potential bride and bridegroom were then both ten years old . ) A quarter of a century later , the reality was less poetical . Louis XIII was not in good health and a Regency in the next thirteen years  --  the age at which a French King reached his majority  --  was more likely than not . How long would it be before Anne , like Catherine de M ? dicis , was promoting herself as an image of revered maternality at the heart of government ? // Furthermore the dynastic map of Europe was transformed . The heir presumptive to the throne of France , the King ? s younger brother Gaston Duc d ? Orl ? ans , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s masculinity , had to accept that his rising hopes of accession had been fatally dashed . But Gaston himself had only daughters . Next in line were the French Princes of the Blood , notably the Prince de Cond ? and his two sons the Duc d ? Enghien and the Prince de Conti ; their hopes were similarly blighted . // On the other hand the birth of a prince not only cut off hopes but also instigated ambitious thoughts of his eventual marriage to a princess . Gaston ? s daughter by his first marriage , Anne-Marie-Louise de Montpensier , was the richest heiress in France from the fortune of her mother who had died at her birth . She did not allow an eleven-year gap in age to prevent her dallying with thoughts of the Dauphin as ? my little husband ? . Even more significant for the future was another equally august birth in Spain . Five days after the ecstatic Queen Anne gave birth to Louis , her sister-in-law , wife of Philip IV , gave birth to a princess . // These two high-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandparents ) , since a brother and a sister of France had married a brother and a sister of Spain . Unlike France , however , Spain allowed females to succeed : Anne of Austria had had to renounce her own rights on her marriage . There was at least a theoretical possibility that the Infanta Maria Teresa would one day succeed to the throne of Spain  --  or her children would . Another theoretical possibility , always present in the mind of Queen Anne , was that Maria Teresa might one day make a bride for Louis . // Under the circumstances , it is easy to understand how the infant Louis was described as ? Dieudonn ? or ? Deodatus ? : Godgiven . And even as the years passed , the apparently miraculous nature of his conception and birth was never forgotten . One German diplomat would refer to the King ? s ? quite extraordinary birth ? over forty years after the event . // How miraculous was this birth , so unexpected and so awe-inspiring for the mother ? Certainly a great deal of prayer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were pilgrimages to shrines , as befitted a Queen who throughout her life liked nothing so much as to visit convents and holy places . Saint Leonard was invoked against sterility ; a hermit who was believed to have founded a monastery near Limoges in the sixth century , his intercession was held responsible for many miracles . ( He was otherwise the patron saint of prisoners  --  and after all the Queen was in the prison of her infertility. ) // The Queen was fast approaching the age at which child-bearing itself was felt to be unlikely . This was a period when women were generally held to age faster than men , losing their bloom early  --  ? no woman is beautiful after twenty-two ? was a popular saying  --  going further downhill after thirty . Certainly , by the time of the Queen ? s thirty-sixth birthday on 22 September 1637  --  and thirty-five was often seen as a cut-off point  --  her relationship with her husband , and also with her adopted country of France , had already had a long and troubled history . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feast of St Catherine  --  25 November  --  1615 . It was , it seems , consummated immediately , and after that there was a gap of more than three years . The twenty-fifth of January 1619 was the auspicious date on which the further completion of the royal union was announced in the gazette Mercure Fran ? ais ( it was after all a matter of state , just as the marriage had been ) . There were certainly rumours of royal pregnancies throughout the 1620s , and Louis XIII himself told the Venetian Ambassador later that his Queen had had four ? wretched miscarriages ? . // If the marriage was not egregiously unhappy by royal standards  --  notoriously low  --  it was certainly unhappy enough . Anne was an extremely attractive , even beautiful woman with her full , voluptuous figure , her thick bright chestnut hair , her luminous pale skin and her dark eyes with the green glints which gave them a special sparkle . She had her share of feminine vanity and was especially proud of her much-admired white hands , which seemed made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , that was made up of contradictions . Anne was certainly pleasure-loving  --  she adored the theatre and gambling  --  but at the same time she was extremely pious . // Her piety did not stop Queen Anne from being a romantic , and it was not difficult for men to fall in love with her : ? her smile won a thousand hearts , ? wrote Madame de Motteville , her lady-in-waiting . She was also galante in the crucial French term of the time which shimmers with different meanings throughout this period . In the case of the Queen , it meant flirtatious in the courtly , essentially innocent manner of the well-chaperoned Spanish Infanta she had once been . When the handsome Duke of Buckingham , who was gallant in every sense of the word , had ? the audacity ? to court her in a famous scene in a garden , the Queen recoiled in horror . Nevertheless , in the opinion of Madame de Motteville , an important source for Anne ? s intimate feelings because she understood the Spanish world , ? if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would have been Buckingham who appealed to her ? . The Princesse de Conti had a more cynical view : she would vouch for the Queen ? s virtue from the waist down , but not from the waist up . // The sexuality of the husband of this romantic and unfulfilled woman was what would now be called troubled . Louis XIII formed lugubrious attachments to both men and women : late in his life , the Marquis de Cinq-Mars became his favourite . But at one point // Louis fell yearningly in love with Marie d ? Hautefort ( his conjugal visits to Anne were said to have increased in consequence ) . However , when his friend the Duc de Saint-Simon offered to act as a go-between , the King was shocked : ? the more my rank as king gives me the facility to satisfy myself , ? he said , ? the more I must guard against sin and scandal. ? Low-spirited and willingly dominated by his great minister Cardinal Richelieu , Louis XIII was one half of an incompatible pair . // Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Habsburg heir , it did not bring about peace between Bourbon and Habsburg kingdoms either . Not long after Anne came to France , the slow strangulation of Europe in that long and complicated conflict known later as the Thirty Years War began . In this conflict , at the instigation of Cardinal Richelieu , the French and Spanish found themselves on different sides . Anne rejected the idea that she remained at heart a Spanish princess . Her tastes might be Spanish , from a predilection for late hours to a yearning for Spanish iced drinks and Spanish chocolate , but she prided herself on having become a Frenchwoman . Louis XIII on the other hand was pervaded with suspicions of his wife ? s disloyalty and over the course of their marriage remained convinced that she ? had a great passion for the interests of Spain ? . // It was a situation which perennially threatened the daughters of great monarchs married off abroad to further their country ? s interests . One can therefore appreciate the wise comment of Erasmus on the subject in the sixteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the incongruity of such matches , which never actually did lead to international peace , and advised kings and princes to marry one of their own subjects instead . // Various opposition movements in the country tended to implicate the King ? s brother  --  and of course heir presumptive for many years  --  Gaston d ? Orl ? ans . Anne was also suspected of joining with him , and in the ultimate alleged conspiracy before her fortunate transformation into the mother of a son , she was accused of plotting to marry Gaston after the King ? s death . And for all her French heart , she still wielded a Spanish pen , corresponding with her brother Philip IV , King of Spain . This was a matter which , when discovered , led to her disgrace in the summer of 1637 . In due course her enemy Cardinal Richelieu secured from Anne a humiliating recantation , signed on 17 August . In the process , one of Anne ? s servants  --  her cloak-bearer Pierre de La Porte  --  was arrested and tortured but refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Porte in his memoirs would refer wryly to Louis as being ? as much the son of my silence , as of the prayers of the Queen and the pious vows of all France ? . It is certainly true that under these unpropitious circumstances some kind of miracle was generally felt to be necessary . // Of course there were , as there always would be , wags who suggested that the miracle had a more human origin . The aggrieved younger brother Gaston d ? Orl ? ans said that he was quite prepared to believe Louis Given by God had come out of the Queen ? s body , but he did not know who the devil had put him there . As to that , popular scandal was quite prepared to supply the name of the King ? s minister Cardinal Richelieu , simply because of his political power ( a ludicrous misreading of the relationship between Anne and the Cardinal ) , with rhymes suggesting that the King had prayed ? to the saints , men and women ? every day and Richelieu had prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The religious of all sorts who prayed for the Queen ? s fertility were many of them , like rainmakers , ready to claim a successful result . A nun , a former favourite of Louis XIII named Louise Ang ? lique de La Fayette , was said to have asked her priest to choose a great feast of the Church  --  presumably the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December  --  to remind her platonic admirer of his conjugal duties : the result was the immediate conception of a more earthly sort . // One story however does have the particular distinction of being believed by Queen Anne herself , and later by her son . This was the prediction in a Paris monastery of a monk named Brother Fiacre , to whom the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared in a vision on 3 // November 1637 . He was told by the Virgin to inform the Queen that she would shortly become pregnant ; then he instructed the royal couple to make three novenas at the cathedral of Notre-Dame and the church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires in Paris  --  and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure chapel at Cotignac in Provence . ( Cotignac may well have been one of the old pagan fertility sites , dedicated to forgotten goddesses , which had been transformed into a place of veneration for the Virgin. ) // In the end it was Brother Fiacre himself , accompanied by the sub-prior of his order , who made the pilgrimage to Cotignac . By the time Brother Fiacre was actually received by the royal couple on 10 February 1638 the Queen was already pregnant . This meant that it was not so much conception as the desired masculine gender of the baby which was now the object of concern . The importance of Brother Fiacre ? s mission was signified by the fact that the King gave orders for free board and lodging to be provided for the pilgrim pair on their way . // It is evident that Brother Fiacre ? s sincerity had made a great impression on Queen Anne when they met . Six years later she called the monk to her presence again with the words : ? I have not forgotten the signal grace you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a son . I have had a great picture made where he Louis is represented in front of the mother of God to whom he offers his crown and sceptre. ? And the monk duly traveled once more to Cotignac with the picture . Nor was this the end of the connection . //
