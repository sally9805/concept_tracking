The path to emotional freedom : beginning to learn to love // Your life is about to get better . // I see great things in your future , a time when wishes come true . // All the notes you put in a bottle were found . // Right here , right now , consider : what do you wish for most ? Is it happiness ? Love ? Less struggle ? An unbumpable ticket to stress relief ? As you ? ll soon learn , the power is within you to achieve these . Or maybe you ? ve completely sworn off wishing in response to a pile-up of disappointments . Of course , I ? ve known that sentiment : " What ? s the use ? " Right ? Wrong ! Such woe-is-me resignation corners you in some godforsaken dead-end unfit for serenity . My determined hope is that you ? ll give wishing for what ? s wonderful another chance . There are moments when opportunities arise . This is one , the staking out of your emotional freedom . Freshly fallen snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings . Your first steps are truly memorable . Don ? t ever forget them . Let me tell you about mine . // The door to emotional freedom cracked open for me as a teenager in southern California . It was 1968 . I was sixteen , a flower child in paisley crop tops , holey jeans , and leather combat boots or barefoot , heavily into the drug scene . My parents were frantic . They kept trying to get through to me , but I made that impossible . My rebellion wasn ? t just against them but to save myself . Though Mother and Dad couldn ? t have loved me more , I felt suffocated by their mainstream vision of who they thought I should be , what would make me happy . Jewish country clubs , " presentable " clothes , conservative friends . . . I didn ? t think so . Some nights , I even slept in my beloved jeans ( my mother despised them ) to feel more free . At the same time , I didn ? t want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this world . Since childhood I ? d experienced many intuitions and dreams that came true , like the times I predicted my grandfather ? s death and my parents ? friends ? divorce , when no one else saw either coming . These and other similar incidents unsettled and confused me . To make matters worse , my parents became so unnerved that I was forbidden to talk to them about my intuitions . Then I was sure there was something really wrong with me , a dread I was totally alone with . I didn ? t choose to predict these things . They just kept happening . I had huge forces churning inside and no way of reconciling them . // Finally , one night , my parents became hell-bent on ending my flirtation with disaster . In a show of gutsy unity , they packed my things , marched me into the car , and checked their only child into a private locked adolescent substance abuse unit of Westwood Psychiatric Hospital . I felt set up , betrayed , and howled my indignation . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was where my path to emotional freedom began . // Every moment in that hospital seems so alive to me now . How I fought the kindness I was offered . Initially I felt like a prisoner . Cooperate ? Not a chance . I tried everyone ? s patience . In daily group therapy sessions I refused to talk . The leader , a tough-love former biker babe in denim , would confront me : " Judi my nickname then , why are you so angry ? " " Huh ? I ? m fine , " I ? d snap , tight-lipped and seething . The more she ? d probe , the more I ? d clam up , pretending to everyone , including myself , just how fine I was . I ? d be equally forthcoming with my psychiatrist . At meals twenty of us teenagers would sit in a beige cafeteria with plastic utensils ( silverware can become weapons ) eating some rubberized version of food . I fully intended to isolate myself , until Windy , a fellow hippie patient who lived in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior didn ? t seem to faze her . Windy ? s innocent nature quickly won me over ; we became inseparable . // Comrades in captivity , during downtime we ? d huddle in my room with its barred windows , plotting our escape . How we ? d slip past the night cleaning crew after they wheeled their mops and brooms through the entrance of our locked unit . Then we ? d hitch a ride to the coast highway , a few miles away , and head to parts unknown . No parents . No authorities . Just free . Though our great escape never came to fruition , all our scheming , giggling , and singing to the Stones ( " You can ? t always get what you want . . . but you just might find you get what you need " ) made confinement more palatable . // Still , I loathed being locked up , and saw no reason to examine my life or change . But other mysterious influences beyond my control seemed to be operating too . I remember there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It stood between us and a fenced yard where we played volleyball . The most brilliant light would shine through its wired panes . I couldn ? t take my eyes off the light . Something loving within that brilliance quieted my snarl , soothed me when words couldn ? t . Ever since I was a child , I ? d felt a loving presence keeping track of me , an invisible friend offering comfort . Usually it stayed in the background , but now it was stepping forward . There was a change wanting to happen within me , and despite my protests , it began with a velocity all its own . Slowly , miraculously , I softened during my fourteen days in this unit . // With the guidance of a wise psychiatrist who understood me and knew how to intervene , I started to realize that I hadn ? t been free in my life before being confined here . I was rebelling against my parents , but without clarity or focus . I was reactive , not proactive . Rebellion and living on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weren ? t the endpoint . Over the next few years , this angel of a man showed me how to better deal with my emotions so I could come from a place that was truer for me . He also helped me begin to embrace my intuitive side , so vital to knowing my soul . Our work together set into motion my calling to become a physician and bring intuition into medicine  --  a genuinely unexpected destiny . Though both my parents were physicians and there were twenty-five physicians in my extended family , given my artistic nature , they ? d never urged this career on me . Getting an M.D. was the last thing I thought I wanted . // Life went on . Two decades later I was a psychiatrist seeing patients in that same hospital . In my case , the ( former ) inmate truly was running the institution ! I felt deliciously subversive . How enlightening to have been a patient on the inside with a bird ? s-eye view of being incarcerated and at the mercy of strangers . What better way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and to learn how to risk receiving the compassion the staff had once shown me ? These are some of the jewels I ? ve taken with me in my search for emotional freedom . // The hospital was flattened by the Northridge earthquake in 1994 , and I must admit , I miss not seeing it when I drive by the site . Mother and Dad shared none of my nostalgia . My teenage self was a nightmare from which they never quite recovered . Incredibly , even in their elder years , they occasionally felt obliged to set the record straight . Summoning up looks of horror I knew so well , they ? d half jokingly say to me  --  a grown woman , for decades a doctor of whom they were extremely proud  --  " Judith , we ? ve never gotten over your adolescence . " // the basics of emotional freedom : the start of your liberation // Your life is brimming with opportunities to learn about emotional freedom . Every success . Every heartbreak . Every loss . Every gain . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be . I want you to start viewing your emotions in a nonordinary way : as vehicles for transformation ( the word emotion comes from the Latin meaning " to move " ) rather than simply as feelings that make you happy or miserable . Expect them to test your heart ; that ? s the point . What you go through  --  what we all go through  --  has a greater purpose . Always , the imperative of emotional freedom is for the love in us to evolve . Albert Camus says , " Freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better . " To make this a reality , you must begin to see each event of your life , uplifting or hurtful , earthshaking or mundane , as a chance to grow stronger , smarter , more light-bearing. // But here ? s where many of us hit a wall . We ? re ashamed of feeling afraid , inadequate , lonely , as if we ? ve failed or done something wrong . None of these conclusions are true . It ? s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . A depressed patient once apologized , " I wish I could be coming to you for something more spiritual . " I felt for him , but like so many people in pain with that commonly held perception , he was mistaken . Facing emotions  --  all of them  --  is a courageous , spiritually transformative act . // As you look into yourself , this is a failproof formula for liberation : dare to keep expanding your heart even if you ? ve been justifiably wounded by pain or disappointment . The effort is never wasted . As you do , ferociously resist selling out by becoming cynical or shutting down ( claustrophobic states worse than death to me ) . No matter what you ? ve experienced , there is always hope for change and healing . It ? s a miracle within reach . Don ? t be afraid to want it . // The way to start is to understand the basics of emotional freedom . Here ? s a mission statement that summarizes the process . To stay clear about your purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of this book . // What does emotional freedom mean ? // It ? s the capacity to give and receive more love . Getting there entails building positive emotions as well as facing and releasing negative ones . Instead of spinning out with , say , anger after you ? ve been hurt , you ? ll respond from a centered , more empathic place . Emotional freedom includes both personal and spiritual evolution . Learning to work with negative emotions , rather than collapsing into them , helps you grow spiritually and rise above what is small within you . Becoming free means removing counterproductive emotional patterns and viewing yourself and others through the lens of the heart . // Why do I need it ? // To liberate yourself from the quicksand of negative emotions . When these accumulate , they disrupt your calmness and compassion , destroy relationships , and ultimately distance you from the joy and wonder of the world . // How do I achieve it ? // Emotions become a springboard for higher consciousness once you see that each one has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , how to build patience to counter frustration . Sometimes , though , as with acute grief , you ? ll learn that you need to just be with the feelings , whereas you can aim to heal and transform envy . There are two stages of processing emotions . First is healthily acknowledging the raw feeling rather than stuffing or airbrushing it . The second is transforming negativity . I ? ll explain many methods to do this with a variety of emotions . // The outcome ? // You ? ll feel happier , more flexible and alive ; you ? ll also be kinder to yourself , your friends , and family . You ? ll have increased patience with coworkers and be able to effectively resolve conflicts . You ? ll connect with your deepest instincts and the power of the heart to surmount even the most disappointing situations . You ? ll feel nurtured and protected by a spiritual force that will let you know you ? re never alone . // I savor this Native American story because it speaks to the essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tribe about two dogs inside his mind : one a white dog that is good and courageous , the other a black dog that is vengeful and angry . Both dogs are fighting to the death . A young brave , unable to wait for the end of the story , asks , " Which one will win ? " The chief responds , " The one I feed . " // Remembering this dynamic , set your intention to feed what ? s best and most beautiful within you , a stance that will impel your liberation . // The goal of emotional freedom is balance . Although in Western culture , being in touch with emotions has become a pop religion  --  making the expression of feelings an end in itself  --  the point here isn ? t to self-indulgently emote or to wall off your feelings . Rather it ? s to become a more caring , aware person . Another goal is to reconnect with your vital essence , which thrives if it ? s not pulverized by stress and pessimism . What a gorgeous feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ? t just think your way to emotional freedom . Throughout this book I ? ll keep underscoring that it grows from a linear understanding of biology and behavior , as well as an intuitively sparked transformation in your soul . To create the positive change you desire , get ready to fire up all of your perceptual capacities , even those you never realized you had . You want to see more than a sliver of what ? s possible for yourself . // evolving beyond conventional medicine : integrating intuition to better grasp emotions // A gift of being a psychiatrist is that others entrust me with their deepest feelings and confidences . Over the years , I ? ve had the opportunity to help countless patients and workshop participants mired in fear , worry , or depression fight to be free . I ? m no stranger to such predicaments , having endured my own share of emotional trials by fire . We ? ve all done our time in anguished places . But , as I ? ll describe , there ? s a way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with you is to be a midwife to the emergence of your finest , freest selves . // Along with my conventional medical training , today I utilize intuition to help my patients achieve emotional freedom . In psychotherapy sessions , I combine nonlinear messages from images , knowings , energy , and dreams with insights provided by my analytic mind . This organic blending of sensibilities lets me make the most of my traditional education and also listen to what emerges from my intuition  --  the knower behind the thinker . Intuition provides access to the psyche ? s deep recesses , which don ? t speak in sentences or paragraphs and are where unexpected connections are made . Further , I teach patients to access their own intuitive abilities to gain greater emotional knowledge of themselves and others and so their lives aren ? t marred by false notes . But this integration hasn ? t always felt so natural , nor have I always practiced psychotherapy in this way . // I received my basic training in emotions as a fledgling psychiatric resident in the early 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at UCLA and the Veterans Administration hospitals . I learned volumes about emotions in these cauldrons of intensity . I was riveted and heartbroken by the in-your-face hard truths of this deeply human experience . The work asked everything of me . But it was good work and it was real . During those endless nights , I saw it all . A stick-thin anorexic girl ( who thought she was fat ) with a ruptured esophagus from vomiting repeatedly to lose weight . //
