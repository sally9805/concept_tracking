<p> It has been 34 days since the first avian influenza infection was confirmed in a poultry flock in Southeast Asia . <p> Since then , health authorities have confronted unprecedented challenges . The fast-moving , fatal poultry disease has caused the slaughter of 80 million poultry in 10 countries and killed 20 people in two of them . Also known as bird flu , the disease has never before occurred over this wide a swath of the world , and it has never before attacked humans in several sites at once . <p> The greatest public health challenge , though , is solving an enigma at the heart of the epidemic : What is the true state of the disease in China ? <p> What scientists fear most is a mixing of influenza strains that would combine the severity of avian influenza with the contagiousness of the human variety . China  --  the globe 's most populous nation , the home of one of the world 's largest poultry industries , and a historic source of new flu viruses  --  is the prime setting where that mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry flocks in 14 of of its 31 provinces , it has steadfastly maintained that the vast country harbors no human cases of the disease . <p> Experts observing the still unfolding epidemic treat that claim  --  which comes exactly a year after SARS first spread from China  --  with skepticism . Instead they suggest that one of two scenarios is possible : Either recognized cases are being concealed , or China 's internal infrastructure is so fractured that illness has occurred and not been recognized . <p> Both scenarios would allow the disease to spread unmonitored . Both are considered cause for alarm . <p> The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have approached the China question with great care . The agencies are charged with identifying and controlling infectious disease outbreaks , but neither possesses the power to compel countries to give access to investigators . Instead they rely on governments ' goodwill  --  something they are unlikely to gain if China feels publicly pressured . <p> Still , both the CDC 's avian flu expert and WHO 's China staff express concern about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> WHO " feels it is conceivable there may be human cases , " said Roy Wadia , a spokesman in Beijing . " Having said that , we think at this time that everything the central government knows is being shared with us  --  though it is possible they might not know everything that might be out there . " <p> The CDC 's chief of influenza epidemiology , Dr. Keiji Fukuda , just returned from leading a bird flu deployment to Hanoi , Vietnam . Speaking of both China and Southeast Asia , he said : " Right now , I would consider the number of human cases which have been identified the minimal number of cases that really exist . " <p> The suggestion that China might conceal human cases of avian flu comes from a historical precedent backed up by recent observations . <p> Last Feb. 21 , a doctor from Guangdong with flulike symptoms checked into the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong . By the time he left the next day , he had infected at least nine people with what would later come to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , Ireland and Singapore , where they infected others , who carried it to Thailand , Taiwan and the Chinese interior . By the time SARS was contained in July , 8,098 people had become seriously ill in 27 countries , and 774 had died . <p> As SARS spread , it emerged that Guangdong and other Chinese provinces had been in the grip of an epidemic of atypical pneumonia since at least November 2002 . Yet China denied until late March any connection between its epidemics and the worldwide problem they had sparked . <p> The concealment of SARS has been widely viewed both as an international embarrassment for China and as a mistake that Beijing  --  which has committed to openly acknowledging internationally relevant health problems  --  is unlikely to make again . <p> " If it has occurred that the avian flu virus has been identified and suppressed , it is a very serious matter , and it would be very important to find out where in the chain of communication that occurred , " said Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan , an Emory University vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry of Health for more than a decade . " I would be rather surprised if any suppression is coming out of Beijing . " <p> Two areas of concern <p> But China experts point out that Beijing 's commitment to openness may not be shared by China 's provinces . <p> " The provinces have agendas that are not necessarily a match for Beijing 's , " said Dr. Myron S. Cohen , head of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine , who does research in China . <p> Two recent events heighten concern that provincial officials might suppress news of flu cases  --  possibly out of fear detection would prove they are not doing their job . <p> The first is the almost monthlong delay between the diagnosis of China 's fourth SARS case in Guangdong this winter and notification of Beijing and WHO . That delay was compounded by health authorities ' failure to follow rules for isolating the patient and tracing his contacts . <p> The second concern centers on remarks made by three Guangdong political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman of the People 's Political Consultative Conference in Guangzhou , the provincial capital  --  criticizing Hong Kong media for even reporting on mainland bird flu outbreaks . One of the officials , Vice Governor Zhong Yangsheng , threatened to have journalists prosecuted . <p> The problem of uncovering possible bird flu cases has been complicated by a split in responsibility common to most governments . The Ministry of Health is responsible only for human illness ; the Ministry of Agriculture tracks disease in animals . <p> " The animal surveillance system across China is inconsistent , " Wadia said . " We see the animal surveillance system as being key , because it is when you know you have an outbreak in a certain place that you can " launch a search for human disease . <p> Holes in the system <p> But China experts say the problem of inadequate surveillance for disease problems and lab capacity to diagnose them exists throughout China , in both the animal and human disease discovery networks . <p> " It does n't have to be purposeful nonreporting . It can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose someone comes into a clinic with flulike symptoms . They see a lot of those , they do n't recognize the potential association with bird flu , and they do n't take samples for testing . The bottom line is , you have to have someone raising the possibility that what they are looking at is avian flu . " <p> The current state of China 's medical system could make such foregone diagnoses more likely . Under socialism , Chinese were guaranteed at least rudimentary health care . With the switch to a market economy , that guarantee is gone . The Asian Development Bank says 90 percent of rural Chinese  --  those most likely to be exposed to the chickens that carry bird flu  --  have no health insurance . In 1998 , the bank said , the need to pay for medical care doubled the number of rural Chinese living in poverty . Meanwhile , the countryside has fewer doctors . <p> " There is an inadequate number of people available to make a diagnosis when someone is sick , " Koplan said . " And people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To health authorities , the need to ascertain the state of China 's bird flu outbreak is urgent . So , too , is the necessity of maintaining good relations with Beijing . China alone can illuminate not only how far the flu has spread , but also how long it has been there , key knowledge for Western scientists hoping to predict its future path . <p> Test results released Friday by the Ministry of Agriculture showed samples taken from birds in four areas of China were not genetically identical , suggesting that the virus may have been in the country , adapting to local birds , for an undetermined period . <p> " We really need to understand much better when these infections developed within Asia and how these infections spread , " Fukuda said . " That timeline is really critical , and right now much of it is uncertain . "
