Section : HISTORY HAPPENED HERE NASHVILLE 'S REWARDS GO BEYOND MUSIC <p> THESE DAYS AIRPORTS try to evoke some of the flavor of the communities they serve , and in Nashville the airport corridor leading from the arrival and departure gates is enlivened by walls full of linear posters , at once stark and vigorous , of country music stars . They bear the unmistakable stamp of Hatch Show Prints , one of the oldest working letterpress printshops in the country , still flourishing in the city 's downtown . Then , just before the stairs leading down to baggage claim , come the familiar strains of " Ring of Fire , " Johnny Cash 's imprint still strong on this rendition . The live performer this day is a young man named Jason Parcheel ; during two sets a day he captivates travelers , allowing them to forget for a few minutes the anxieties of flying , its delays , and the specter of lost luggage . <p> This is a good introduction to Nashville , Tennessee 's capital , AKA Music City USA , but does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer ? You can , of course , spend virtually 24 hours a day in and around Nashville soaking up the music scene , but then you 'll miss out on an awful lot . Downtown itself , home to the Country Music Hall of Fame as well as countless clubs , barbecue joints , and honky-tonks , also has the world-class Hermitage Hotel , the new Frist Center for the Visual Arts , housed in a carefully restored Deco post office ( where you can still mail letters ) , and a gorgeous Romanesque Revival railroad station , now home to a hotel and top-notch restaurant . There is a clear sense here of a city enjoying a rebirth . <p> For a layered look at Nashville 's history , head down to Fort Nashborough by the Cumberland River . It 's a one-quarter-scale re-creation of the fort that sheltered the settlers of 1779 , built in 1930 by a local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution . From behind the fort 's log walls you can look up to Second Avenue North , where live music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served the prosperous commercial city of the late nineteenth century still stand , forming a fairly complete and attractive streetscape . Beyond their facades rises a modern skyline made distinctive by a signature skyscraper , the BellSouth Building , nicknamed almost as soon as it opened in 1994 the Bat Building for its double-peaked top that seems to resemble Batman 's silhouette . <p> Over the years Nashville has been designated the Athens of the South because of its many colleges , and the Wall Street of the South , reflecting an early boom in insurance and other financial institutions , but it is country music with which it is most closely associated . It started in 1925 with WSM Barn Dance , the world 's longest-running radio program , sponsored by the National Life and Accident Insurance Company . The station 's call letters stand for the sponsor 's boast : " We Shield Millions . " By the 1950s Nashville was a center of all aspects of the recording industry , and today , says the mayor , Bill Purcell , it holds its own with Los Angeles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music Hall of Fame , a 130,000-square-foot space opened three years ago and designed with as much built-in symbolism as a cathedral , which in a sense it is , the point is made over and over that Nashville thrives not just on country but on pop , jazz , big band , gospel , bluegrass , and rhythm and blues . City fathers also point proudly to the soon-to-open multimillion-dollar symphony hall , rising eater-corner to the Hall of Fame . <p> As for the Hall of Fame 's iconography , I learn from an excellent museum publication that the structure forms a massive bass clef when viewed from the air . Furthermore , the entrance forms an arc suggesting the tailfin of a 1959 Cadillac , " the front windows resemble piano keys , " and the building is topped by a tower that " stretches skyward like a church steeple , recalling the role of religious culture in country music 's history . " None of this would I have figured out on my own , but the exhibits within certainly speak for themselves , from Elvis 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams and Tennessee Ernie Ford , to rhinestone-studded costumes and gold-plated records . In short , everything you would ever want to know about country music and its cousins is here . <p> Outside hums the city that draws more than 10 million visitors a year , each surrounding block expressing its own character . Stretching between Fourth and Fifth Avenues , the Arcade , an iron and glass-roofed marvel built in 1903 and inspired by structures common in nineteenth-century Italy , could use some sprucing up . It still has its charms - pigeons fly through and people grab sandwiches from a few lunch spots and then sit at tables in the main corridor - but with a little attention this wonderful relic from the era when everyone came downtown to shop could really shine again . <p> I was swept by the same nostalgia when I spotted an empty Kress Building across Fifth from the Arcade , its 1930s terra cotta facade intact . Then I noticed a sign , KRESS LOFTS FOR SALE , the first tip-off that these commercial streets that today more or less close down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Other condominiums and rentals , some new , some renovated , are starting to rise on the Nashville skyline . <p> The Kress Building was an anchor on the street in the 1940s and 1950s , which is why , in February 1960 , it became one of the staging areas for the sit-in movement that soon led to widespread desegregation of the city 's public facilities . The story of how Jim Crow lunch counters fell to a massive nonviolent campaign started by Nashville 's large population of black college students is magnificently told in the Civil Rights Room of Nashville 's newly opened library on Church Street . <p> A round table in the center of the room symbolizes the embattled lunch counters . Engraved on its surface are 10 rules of conduct , powerful enough to fuel a revolution , set out by two of the leaders , Bernard Lafayette and John Lewis , now a Georgia congressman . " DO NOT : Strike back nor curse if abused ; laugh out ; hold conversations with floor walker ; leave your seat until your leader has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aisles inside . DO : Show yourself friendly and courteous at all times ; sit straight , always face the counter ; report all serious incidents to your leader ; refer information seekers to your leader in a polite manner ; remember the teachings of Jesus Christ , Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King . " <p> When King came to Nashville two months later , he said it was " not to bring inspiration , but to gain inspiration from the great movement that has taken place in this community . " <p> The nationally known Fisk University provided many of the students who fueled this great movement . One of the highlights of my time in Nashville was a visit to Fisk 's art galleries . The modest brick structure , built as a church in 1888 and then used as a gym , gives little hint of the treasures within . The Carl Van Vechten Gallery is named for the great photographer of the Harlem Renaissance who , as a friend of Dr. Charles Sturgeon Johnson , Fisk 's president , steered the collection there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as many important American painters , and it belonged to the famous photographer and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz , whose wife , Georgia O'Keeffe , deeded the works to Fisk . <p> South of the city , in a very elegant neighborhood called Belle Mead ( and home to Tipper and Al Gore ) , is the 55-acre Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art . I was there in November , and the trees and plantings were showing their last flare . The varied gardens and plantings wove color and texture together like an ancient tapestry . The 1930s Georgian mansion had been built with Maxwell House coffee riches , and most of the furnishings , art glass , china , and a good range of American paintings had come together after the Cheek family departed , having first donated the property to the city . Roaming through the house and its gardens , then stopping at the Pineapple Room Restaurant , could pleasantly consume the better part of a day . <p> An agreeable anomaly among Cheekwood 's carefully groomed attractions is a group of powerful stone figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up by some of Nashville 's creative folk in the 1930s , given a show at New York 's Museum of Modern Art , and through it all maintained an endearing simplicity , in both chisel and speech . " I am just doing the Lord 's work , " Edmondson said . " I ai n't got much style ; God do n't want much style , but he gives wisdom and speeds you along . " <p> A 15-minute drive east of Nashville brings you to another great estate , the Hermitage , home of President Andrew Jackson . He bought the land in 1804 , at first living with his wife , Rachel , in a log cabin and eventually building a house that grew grander as his fortune did , and most of the furnishings we see today actually belonged to him . This man of the people - the only President who has an era named for him - lived very well indeed . The handsomely proportioned large rooms and hand-painted wallpaper imported from France speak to that . <p> When I visited , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're told , the President elect was always reminded at that season of his wife 's death in 1828 , just before the holiday . After that , Jackson needed more than ever to be surrounded by people , especially his friend the great portrait painter Ralph Earl . While Jackson lived there , Earl performed various homely tasks , like opening Jackson 's mail . He also painted Jackson , his family , and associates through the years in many fine works that hang at the Hermitage and in abundance at the Tennessee State Museum downtown . <p> The subject of Presidents as slave owners is being scrutinized these days as never before , and the Hermitage is no exception . In fact , visitors ' most frequently asked question is one with a built-in contradiction : Was he a good slave owner ? As at every historic property with a slave history , the present-day keepers want to answer yes . Here at the Hermitage we learn that Jackson " was not especially harsh " and that when selling slaves , he never broke up a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings on the property should shed more light on this , as will the more than a half-million artifacts relating to the slave population that have been dug up so far . <p> One of the docents at the house mentioned that a restaurant in Printer 's Alley , named , he thought , the Brass Rail , retained a brick wall from the stables where the young lawyer Jackson had kept his horses . Just before leaving town , I decided to check it out . The picturesque Printer 's Alley is a block-long cut between two streets that house many of the city 's liveliest clubs . I peered down it early on a Sunday morning when it was deserted except for an amiable fellow continuing last night 's drunk . Everything was closed , including the Brass Stables , as it was called , but I probably would n't have ventured in anyway . I picked up a leaflet at the front door to discover that it 's an " Exotic Showbar , " billing itself as Nashville 's " Best Kept Secret for Adult Entertainment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For me at least , that will be another Nashville secret . <p> Back at the airport , with a two-hour delay ahead , I wandered the corridors . No live music this time , but still a reminder of Music City . I passed a defibrillator prudently mounted on a wall and idly stopped to read an inscription near it . " For Your Achy Breaky Heart , " it said . <p> YOU CAN SPEND 24 HOURS A DAY SOAKING UP NASHVILLE 'S MUSIC SCENE , BUT THEN YOU 'LL MISS OUT ON AN AWFUL LOT . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Downtown is home to the venerable Hatch Show Prints . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Enthralling exhibits about peaceful protest at the Public Library 's Civil Rights Room . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Hermitage Hotel has been restored to Gilded Age glory . <p> By Carla Davidson <p> TO PLAN A TRIP <p> CONTACT THE NASHVILLE CONVENTION AND VISITORS Bureau at 800-657-6910 or visit www.nashvillecvb.com for information about the city 's historic sites as well as present-day activities and places to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was delighted to check in at the top-rated Hermitage Hotel built in 1910 and recently brought back to the elegance , typified by the stained-glass ceiling in the lobby , that had made it the center of Nashville life for decades . In fact this was the headquarters for both sides of the women 's suffrage movement , until Tennessee cast the definitive vote in favor . The hotel has a superb restaurant , and in its vicinity is a men 's room of such Art Deco perfection that a sign outside invites women to have a peek , when possible . : <p> A truly inspired project , the Bicentennial Capitol Mall , went up in 1996 near the Capitol to celebrate 200 years of Tennessee 's statehood . It features a walkway stretching 1,440 feet and bordered by a low granite wall on which are inscribed high points of the state 's history . Here and there are quotes from people who made that history : writers , politicians , and ordinary citizens . A parallel path is devoted to Tennessee 's natural history : rivers represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened by native plantings common to various sections of the state . The mall was almost empty the morning I was there ; granted it was a cloudy late-November day , but I 'd like to think this wonderful place is often thronged . <p> We must n't forget the Grand Ole Opry . Having departed the Ryman Auditorium in 1974 , it is now the central focus of Opryland , a mall and hotel sprawl of surpassing glitz . But the theater itself is lit by the devotion of its audience in the way of any great church . <p>
