<p> I 've never quite understood the bandwagon phenomenon where a cuisine languishes for decades and then all of a sudden explodes onto everyone 's collective palate . It happened with Thai , East-West and Vietnamese cuisines , and now it looks as if we 're beginning a love affair with Peru . <p> For decades the Peruvian restaurant Fina Estampa garnered all the accolades , but in the last few years it 's been joined by many others , including Destino , Fresca , Limon and several Nuevo Latino places that throw Peruvian specialties into the mix . <p> Now the owners of Fresca have opened a Pacific Heights version of their popular West Portal cafe . Glazed rust and amber stucco walls , art displayed in heavy gilt frames , and a polished slate floor helps expose the rustic , melting-pot cuisine to a whole new audience . <p> Once you dig into the myriad ceviches , you 'll begin to get an idea why Peruvian food is on the tip of everyone 's tongue . The ceviches are fresh and vibrant and tie into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may support the most varied cuisine in all of South America , incorporating influences from Spain , Africa , Italy , Japan and China . Many first-timers are surprised to see the shrimp , crab and cream cheese-stuffed wontons ( $8.25 ) , but when you get to know the cuisine it makes perfect sense , as do the sirloin strips sauteed with onions , tomatoes and French fries , and varnished with a balsamic-soy glaze . In the mid-1800s more than 100,000 Chinese immigrated to Peru , which is now home to several thousand Chinese restaurants . <p> Aji , the chile found in Peru , is another factor that makes Americans warm to this cuisine and coincides with our current passion for full-flavored foods . These days bold is in ; subtle is out . <p> Still , the challenge of opening this type of restaurant is that the Bay Area 's Peruvian population is relatively small , so the chef has to educate the masses and lure them into unfamiliar territory . <p> Fresca is the dream of Jose Calvo-Perez , 25 , who began working in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the California Culinary Academy and spent a year cooking in Spain , which solidified his desire to open an upscale and creative restaurant that celebrated his native cuisine . He estimates that about 80 percent of his menu is fairly traditional , and he tries to keep the spirit of the cuisine in everything he does . He also makes yearly treks to Peru to keep up on what 's happening there . <p> The concept behind the original Fresca - patterned after hundreds of similar fast food restaurants all over Peru - was to serve rotisserie chicken . Calvo-Perez has expanded the menu , but it is based on home-style cooking . Still , even at the more upscale location this juicy herb-crusted bird ( $10.25 ) is a best-seller . It 's crisp and moist , playing the bold seasoning on the skin off the delicate flavor of the meat , served with fries and a green salad with a creamy cilantro vinaigrette , blessed with just the right amount of acid and spice . <p> The menu at Fresca offers a culinary glimpse of the entire country featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highlands and the sauteed beef and skewered items from the region around Lima . <p> Fresca features eight marinated raw fish dishes . Just about every restaurant , without regard to its origins , seems to offer a tuna dish these days , but even the high-end places could take a lesson from this 55-seat restaurant . Three mounds of the chopped ruby-colored fish ( $10 ) are flavored with an avocado mash and a yellow-hued cream made with huacatay , a type of Peruvian mint , then arranged on a rectangular platter with lettuce wraps and wonton chips . <p> One of the best ways to sample what Calvo-Perez does is to order the three-tier tasting ( $28 ) , which is brought to the table on a stacked tray . Some options include cubes of halibut with Amarillo aji - the Peruvian chile - and spiced with ginger and lime . It 's served with roasted sweet potatoes and a red onion salsa on top . Sea bass is sliced paper thin and splayed on the plate with lime , dollops of mild chile puree and a jicama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salmon also gets an interesting treatment , the traditional lime joined by a surprising punch of mint and a mustard marinade , all accented with a peppery watercress salad . <p> Crab cake-lovers will warm to the panko-crusted patties with a steamy interior filled with shreds of meat ( $8.50 ) , accented with a mango , ginger and lime sauce ( $8.50 ) . The Peruvian lima bean salad ( $7.95 ) has potential , if only the chef would let the fleshy beans cook a little more . The flavor of herbs and chive oil adds interest to the beans , and the prawns on top tastes as if they are infused with lemon and lime . <p> The fried calamari in the appetizer section at first looks expensive at $15.50 but it 's big enough for four . Heaped with golden crisp tendrils of squid , prawns and scallops and a lacy blanket of marinated red onion rings , the platter practically covers the entire table . <p> You ca n't go wrong with any of the appetizers , but the main courses are n't as interesting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpowered by too many ingredients mounded on top . We had to dig through layers of stewed onions to get to the trout ( $16.25 ) ; and the garlic-crusted red snapper ( $16.50 ) looked as if a @x of mussels , clams , prawns , calamari and scallops had been poured over the fish . One end of the thick slab of grilled halibut ( $15.95 ) rose above the onion and tomato topping , but it might as well have been chicken the flavor was so obliterated . <p> If you want stew , try the Picante de Mariscos ( $15.95 ) , with all kinds of seafood bathed in a spicy red broth . After a few spoonfuls , take a break with a bite of aji de gallina ( $12.50 ) . It 's a rather bland combination of shredded chicken in a cream sauce with grilled potatoes , a few toasted walnuts and wedges of hard boiled eggs . <p> One of the best main courses is the arroz con mariscos ( $17.25 ) , with cumin-scented rice balanced with tomato and prawns , calamari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chile sofrito , adding the flavor of bell peppers and onions to the blend . Braised pork in a red wine adobo ( $13.50 ) is perked up with a mild chile puree , a barbecue style sauce and roasted sweet potatoes , beans and rice . <p> When it comes to dessert , the chocolate cake ( $6 ) is the clear winner . For a less intense experience , consider the frothy mango cheesecake ( $6 ) drizzled with mango sauce . A mango shake ( $6 ) is another option , served with powdered sugar-dusted sandwich cookies filled with dulce de leche . <p> Unfortunately , the restaurant has n't quite mastered the art of pacing or timing . On one visit we were still eating when the waiter came to clear the appetizers , telling us the main courses were ready . Another time we had too many dishes on the table at once , making it uncomfortable to eat . The staff is often slow to take plates , so customers are left to juggle . <p> Still , as the crowds will attest , Fresca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's clear Calvo-Perez has a vision , and one of the best things about dining out is being able to experience someone 's dream . <p> Beer May Be the Better Option <p> When you look over the list at Fresca your first impression is that wine does n't go with Peruvian food , because the pricing sticks in the craw . <p> The 33 wines come from California , Argentina , Spain and Chile , and there are some good bottles to be had . Still it 's hard to understand why people would want to pay more than three times wholesale when the staff is n't trained , the glassware is catering quality and the wine is n't stored in climate-controlled conditions . No vintages are given for the wines , but it 's apparent they 're all current releases . Customers pay about 3.5 times wholesale for the Cantena Chardonnay from Argentina , priced at $35 on the list . The DeLoach Zinfandel is $40 and costs the restaurant around $14 . <p> Better options include the 12 Latin beers ( $4 ) which include four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you bring your own wine , corkage is $10 . <p> - M.B . <p>  --  CHART : FRESCA 2114 Fillmore St. ( near California ) , San Francisco , ( 415 ) 447-2668 Lunch 11 a.m. -4 p.m. daily ; dinner 4-10 p.m .
