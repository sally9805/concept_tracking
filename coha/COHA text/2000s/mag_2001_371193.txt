The first thing you feel is the heat . Even on a warm , sunny day , the patient rooms and hallways of the burn unit at New York Presbyterian Hospital are heated to 85degrees F. For the most severely burned , that 's still not warm enough ; with so much skin scorched away , the body can no longer keep up the temperature that internal organs need to function . <P> Within an hour of the second plane crash , a dozen patients  --  all with life-threatening burns  --  had been speeded by ambulance to this , the nation 's leading burn unit , which by perverse happenstance is located about 100 blocks from Ground Zero . Because burns need immediate , specialized care , the most serious cases bypassed the emergency room and were sent directly to the special unit . By the next day , 25 victims had been admitted . <P> In the brightly lighted hallways , a sheet of paper taped to the wall inside each room tells the story : on front- and back-view sketches of the human body , doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of the damage . In many cases , more than 70% of the body is darkened . " The intense heat and the inability to get away are what makes these burns so severe , " says Dr. Roger Yurt , director of the unit . One patient , scorched by a fireball of debris , lies almost completely swathed in bandages under a tent of heat shields and blankets . Another , propelled forward by a ruptured steam pipe , is scorched along his back and the back of his legs but was miraculously spared on the entire front of his body  --  a stark representation of the arbitrary line drawn between health and injury , normality and trauma , life and death . <P> With so much skin compromised , the top priority for doctors is to keep a patient 's body warm and hydrated . In the first 24 hours , the treatment is surprisingly simple : saline fluid  --  sometimes as much as 8 gal .  --  to keep up blood volume and stabilize blood pressure , and morphine for pain . Only after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yurt , can surgery begin  --  a painstaking process in which burned skin is scraped away and substitute sheets grafted in . And even then , only about 20% to 30% of the severely burned will survive . <P>  --  By Alice Park
