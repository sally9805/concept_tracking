Few bands have taken as much abuse for what they are not as Coldplay . The British foursome sold 5 million copies of its very good first album , 2000 's Parachutes , but was slagged on both sides of the Atlantic because its abstract , lovelorn pop was neither abstract enough to be Radiohead nor pop enough to be Oasis . This middle existence between the brains and the brawn of British rock led Alan McGee , the manager who discovered Oasis , to dismiss Coldplay as " music for bed wetters . " <P> Coldplay 's second album , A Rush of Blood to the Head , finds the band plowing ahead with the bed-wetter thing and improving . Lead singer Chris Martin has a lovely high voice , and he has all the solipsistic tendencies of a latter-day Morrissey . He writes about breakups and sadness and fear of death , but unlike so many other weary chroniclers , he is a romantic not a cynic . When he sings " Nobody said it was easy , it 's such a shame for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The truth is I miss you " on Warning Sign , he sounds in love with love , which may make him even wetter than McGee thought . <P> The advance on Rush is that Martin 's voice is tethered to some terrific music . Parachutes was full of floating guitars and twinkling pianos that laid the framework for a Coldplay sound  --  a sound that got a little boring over the course of an album . Rush still hovers more than it grinds , but the group is now unafraid of the occasional tempo shift , and on some songs drummer Will Champion even trades in his brushes for real live drumsticks ! The result , on standout tracks Politik and Clocks , is a low-adrenaline kick from the music and high romance from Martin . And that makes the middle a very nice place to be .  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
