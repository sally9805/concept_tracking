Soap dish Kelly Ripa enjoys a year of noblesse o'Reege. by Nicholas Fonseca Photograph HOSTESS WITH THE MOSTEST Ripa ( 1 ) bantering with Reege on Live ; ( 2 ) canoodling with Cavanagh on Ed // WHEN Kelly Ripa FIRST appeared at Regis Philbin 's side in November 2000-just three months after Kathie Lee Gifford ended her embattled 15-year run as cohost of Live-guest psychic Char Margolis correctly surmised she was pregnant with her second child . It was the kind of unscripted moment TV producers dream about , but in retrospect , it 's also noteworthy for what Margolis did n't predict : that Ripa , 31 , would take a permanent perch with the 68-year-old Philbin last Feb. 12 , and become a morning phenom even bigger than Kathie Lee at her pretabloid- peak . Ratings for Live With Regis and Kelly , already surging after Gifford left in July 2000 , have continued a steady climb since Ripa pulled up a chair at the coffee latch . Th wit : In its 17th year , Live ranks behind only The Oprah Winfrey Show among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages 18-34 by a whopping 75 percent . And in markets where they compete , Ripa routinely outshines NBC 's $65 million newsgal Katie Couric , as Live clobbers Today 's third and fluffiest hour by nearly a full ratings point . ( Moreover , Ripa is a comparative bargain , earning an estimated $3 million to $5 million annually for Live . ) " It 's the exception rather than the rule that a program would increase that much after being on for so long , " marvels Horizon Media analyst Brad Adgate . " I would guess the reason is Kelly Rips . She was a good choice . " We 'll say . The perky , selfdeprecating native of Berlin , N.J. , brings a lot to her elevated chair . Younger and less polarizing than her 48-year-old predecessor-at least she 's not yet a target for Howard Stern-Ripa has a passionate fan base after 11 years playing plucky heroine Hayley Vaughan Cortlandt McIntyre Santos on ABC 's All My Children , where she still lathers up about three days per week . Plus , viewers have embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oft curmudgeonly Reege . " Now it 's fun , " observes Soap Opera Weekly executive editor Carolyn Hinsey , a longtime Ripa pal . " When the inevitable thing goes wrong , you know Kelly 's going to make it funny and make it work . " Though Ripa declined to comment for this story , last year she told ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY that her success owed much to her right-hand man : " If you work with Regis , you 're gon na come off looking good , because he wo n't let you look any other way . " ( Philbin also nixed interview requests . ) But Ripa 's morning glory may just be a stepping-stone . Witness her high-profile Feb. 27 guest spot on Ed . " At the core , Kelly is an absolute TV star , " gushes Ed executive producer Bob Burnett , who does n't rule out a Ripa reprise as Tom Cavanagh 's love interest . Burnett adds jokingly : " In fact , my advice would be for her to dump Regis immediately . " Photograph // He was kidding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gelman stresses that Ripa knows her priorities . " I do n't think you 'll see her in an ongoing situation that would take her away from us , " says Gelman . " But she 's got leeway to do other projects , and we think it only brings more people to the table . " Ripa 's agent , Jim Ornstein , denies rumors that his client is angling to host her own chatfest . But expect to see more Ripa in the future-especially considering that Gifford plugged everything from Carnival cruises to Almay makeup to that notorious Wal-Mart clothing line . " We have a lot of stuff brewing for Kelly , " says Ornstein , though he declines to elaborate . With the inevitable parade of endorsements just around the corner , Ripa 's biggest dilemma will become how to continue to juggle both of her day jobs . Children exec producer Jean Dadario Burke says Ripa has given no indication she 's ready to leave the soap , where she frequently shares scenes with her on- and offscreen hubby , Mark Consuelos , 31 . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lola Grace , 8 months . ) " I 'm sure it wo n't be forever , " sighs Burke , " but I do n't want to know when the end is . " She 's not the only one .
