Chapter One A bead of sweat took a slow path down his throat and into the neckline of his dark T-shirt . Pushed by a hot , insubstantial breeze , a weed brushed his cheek . Clint never moved . Through the shifting shadows of the pulled blinds , he could detect activity in the small cabin . The low drone of voices filtered out the screen door , but Clint could n't make out any of the slurred conversation . Next to him , Red stirred . In little more than a breath of sound , he asked , " Fuck , I hate waiting . " Wary of a trap , Clint wanted the entire area checked . Mojo chose that moment to slip silently into the grass beside them . He 'd done a surveillance of the cabin , the surrounding grounds , and probably gotten a good peek in the back window . Mojo could be invisible and eerily silent when he chose . " All 's clear . " Something tightened inside Clint . " She in there ? " " Alive but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes narrowed . " Four men . They 've got her tied up . " Clint silently worked his jaw , fighting for his famed icy control . The entire situation was bizarre . How was it Asa knew where to find the men , yet they did n't appear to expect an interruption ? Had Robert deliberately fed the info to Asa , to embroil in a trap , so Clint would kill him ? And why would Robert want Asa dead ? Somehow , both he and Julie Rose were pawns . But for what purpose ? Clint 's rage grew , clawing to be freed , making his stomach pitch with the violent need to act . " They 're armed ? " Mojo nodded with evil delight . " And on their way out . " Given that a small bonfire lit the clearing in front of the cabin , Clint was n't surprised that they would venture outside . The hunting cabin was deep into the hills , mostly surrounded by thick woods . Obviously , the kidnappers felt confident in their seclusion . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tip had proved invaluable . And a bit too fucking timely . So far , nothing added up , and that made him more cautious than anything else could have . He 'd work it out as they went along . The drive had cost them two hours , with another hour crawling through the woods . But now he had them . He had her . The cabin door opened and two men stumbled out under the glare of a yellow bug light . One wore jeans and an unbuttoned shirt , the other was shirtless , showing off a variety of tattoos on his skinny chest . They looked youngish and drunk and stupid . They looked cruel . Raucous laughter echoed around the small clearing , disturbed only by a feminine voice , shrill with fear and anger , as two other men dragged Julie Rose outside . She was n't crying . No sir . Julie Rose was complaining . Her torn school dress hung off her right shoulder nearly to her waist , displaying one small pale breast . She struggled against hard hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hip in the barren area in front of the house . With her hands tied behind her back , she had no way to brace herself . She fell flat , but quickly struggled into a sitting position . The glow of the bonfire reflected on her bruised , dirty face - and in her furious eyes . She was frightened , but she was also livid . " I think we should finish stripping her , " one of the men said . Julie 's bare feet peddled against the uneven ground as she tried to move further away . The men laughed some more and the one who 'd spoken went onto his haunches in front of her . He caught her bare ankle , immobilizing her . " Not too much longer , bitch . Morning 'll be here before you know it . " He stroked her leg , up to her knee , higher . " I bet you 're getting anxious , huh ? " Her chest heaved , her lips quivered . She spit on him . Clint was on his feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red 's hissed curses could register . The four men , standing in a cluster , turned to look at him with various expressions of astonishment , confusion and horror . They were slow to react , and Clint realized they were more than a little drunk . Idiots . One of the young fools reached behind his back . " You . " Clint stabbed him with a fast lethal look while keeping his long , ground-eating pace to Julie . " Touch that weapon and I 'll break your leg . " The guy blanched - and promptly dropped his hands . Clint did n't think of anything other than his need to get between Julie and the most immediate threat . But without giving it conscious thought , he knew that Mojo and Red would back him up . If any guns were drawn , theirs would fire first . The man who 'd been abusing Julie snorted in disdain at the interference . He took a step forward , saying , " Just who the hell do you think you - " Reflexes on automatic , Clint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . The force of his boot heel caught the man on the chin with sickening impact . He sprawled flat with a raw groan that dwindled into blackness . He did n't move . Another man leaped forward . Clint stepped to the side , and like clockwork , kicked out a knee . The obscene sounds of breaking bone and cartilage and the accompanying scream of pain split the night , sending nocturnal creatures to scurry through the leaves . Clint glanced at Julie 's white face , saw she was frozen in shock , and headed toward the two remaining men . Eyes wide , they started to back up , and Clint curled his mouth into the semblance of a smile . " I do n't think so . " A gun was finally drawn , but not in time to be fired . Clint grabbed the man 's wrist and twisted up and back . Still holding him , Clint pulled him forward and into a solid punch to the stomach . Without breath , the painful shouts ended real quick . The second Clint released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clint did n't want to , but he let him go . Robert Burns had said not to bring anyone in . He could n't see committing random murder , and that 's what it 'd be if he started breaking heads now . But in an effort to protect Julie Rose and her apparently already tattered reputation , he would n't turn them over to the law either . Just letting them go stuck in his craw , and Clint , fed up , ready to end it , turned to the forth man . He threw a punch to the throat and jaw , then watched the guy crumble to his knees , then to his face , wheezing for breath . Behind Clint , Red 's dry tone intruded . " Well , that was efficient . " Clint struggled with himself for only an instant before realizing there was no one left to fight . He turned , saw Julie Rose held in wide-eyed horror , and he jerked . Mojo stepped back out of the way , and Clint lurched to the bushes . Anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least for Clint Evans and his weak-ass stomach , he puked. * * * Julie could hardly believe her eyes . One minute she 'd known she would be raped and probably killed , and the fear had been all consuming , a live clawing dread inside her . Now ... now she did n't know what had happened . Three men , looking like angelic convicts , had burst into the clearing . Well no , that was n't right . The first man had n't burst anywhere . He 'd strode in , casual as you please , then proceeded to make mince meat out of her abductors . He 'd taken on four men as if they were no more than gnats . She 'd never seen that type of brawling . His blows had n't been designed to slow down an opponent , or to bruise or hurt . One strike - and the men had dropped like dead weights . Even the sight of the gun had n't fazed him . He moved so fast , so smoothly , the weapon had n't mattered at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , hard and cold , had n't changed . A kick here , a punch there , and the men who 'd held her , taunted her , were no longer a threat . He was amazing , invincible , he was ... throwing up . Her heart pounded in slow , deep thumps that hurt her breastbone and made it difficult to draw an even breath . The relief flooding over her in drowning force did n't feel much different than her fear had . Her awareness of that man was almost worse . Like spotting Superman , or a wild animal or a combination of both , she felt awed and amazed and disbelieving . She was safe now , but was she really ? One of the saviors approached her . He was fair , with blond hair and light eyes , though she could n't see the exact color in the dark night with only the fire for illumination . Trying to make himself look less like a convict , he gave her a slight smile . A wasted effort . He moved real slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Clint . " He spoke in a low , melodic croon . " He always pukes afterward . " Her savior 's name was Clint . ( Continues ... )
