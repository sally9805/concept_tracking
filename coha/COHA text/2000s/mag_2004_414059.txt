If priests were husbands and fathers , they would have more credibility in giving guidance to Catholic couples and families-and in challenging todays sex-saturated culture . One priest argues that 's the best reason to reconsider mandatory celibacy. // LAST YEAR 'S LETters to the U.S. bishops from priests in several dioceses brought the issue of optional celibacy into the headlines again . The priests ' letters highlighted the serious shortage of priests and the growing lack of available eucharistie celebration for the faithful . // I agree with the contents of the letters . But there is a broader and equally serious reason that needs to be raised . These days we humans are having real difficulties with our sexuality . A brief glance at TV , the movies , the Internet , and the local magazine rack gives a quick sampling of our unbalance . Advertisers use sex to sell products . Singers use sex to mask their lack of musical talent . Talk shows are obsessed with sexual aberrations . Considering the extent of prostitution , adultery , group sex , pedophilia , and spousal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a clue about why we were created male and female . For much of our society , sex is seen as something people use for entertainment , for selling products , or for manipulating others . The problem is not just sexual aberration and exploitation . The real offense against human sexuality is that it is trivialized . Many people experience sex as something that is pleasurable but devoid of meaning . Sex for them becomes a shallow activity , intensely involving the body but offering little connection to the soul . Their sexual encounters engage physical organs but not the person . They settle for sex appeal , when what is possible is self-realization . They settle for technique , when what is possible is transcendence . Very simply , what was designed to reach the very core of the human soul has been relegated to the surface . What was meant to free people from their egos has instead entrapped them in the realm of self-centeredness . There is no commitment . There is no trust . There is no love . In the midst of this mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people should turn to their ordained spiritual leaders for guidance . Ah , here is the problem for Catholics . A medieval law still in force in our Roman Catholic community requires all bishops and priests to be celibate . No doubt there are many great and holy bishops and priests . But we all lack in one basic area-a lived experience of married love . All the good will in the world does n't make up for this lack of experience . As spiritual leaders we priests have n't " walked a mile in the shoes " of the married people we are meant to lead . We are lacking the sexual experience that is possible within marriage . We can preach about the shoulds and should nots of sexual morality . And we can certainly say a lot about abstinence , denial , and sublimation . But what do we know of the human wholeness and spiritual holiness that can be achieved in the bonding of body , heart , will , and soul through the sacrament of Marriage ? Our world , perhaps more than ever before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human sexuality . Young people especially need believable pacesetters in sexual maturity . The church needs to proclaim from the rooftops that it has a better message about sex than the culture offers . We priests , who are the most visible wisdom figures , who are ordained to be teachers and sages , need among our number those who will give prophetic witness to the goodness and beauty of married love . APPROACH MARRIED COUPLES IN A TYPICAL CATHOLIC PARISH and ask them : " When was the last time you heard a Sunday homily about married spirituality ? " Most likely , they will scratch their heads , think for a while , and then respond , " Maybe once last year , " or " A long time ago , " or even , " Never . " Most of the people in our pews are either married , have been married , or will one day be married . They live much of their life practicing their faith and finding their path to holiness through the sacrament of Marriage . They could certainly use some guidance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , they can not get much help from priests because we are all celibate . Let 's be honest . In the eyes of the faithful , we are very limited in what we can preach . Our homilies and other teachings are narrowed to life as seen through the eyes of a celibate . The result ? At best , there is a vast population of married people floundering about with sparse spiritual direction for a major segment of their lives . Many turn to other churches where a married clergy understands their experience and speaks their language . At worst , there are dysfunctional families , a high divorce rate , spousal abuse , and a large array of other problems that are compounded when there is no effective conjugal leadership from our pulpits . THE FIRST MORAL STATEMENT IN THE BIBLE PROCLAIMS , " IT is not good for the man to be alone . " Where do we find the church proclaiming by word and example the goodness of God 's plan for sexuality ? Where does our ordained leadership witness to communion with the Creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to give clear spiritual direction , by word and the example of its spiritual leaders , that will guide married couples on their sacramental journey to God . The Catholic Church needs to promote respect for the human body , teaching by word and the example of its spiritual leaders , the dignity , nobility , and sanctity of human sexuality . The Catholic Church needs to proclaim to our youth , by word and the example of its spiritual leaders , the power of premarital and marital chastity to shape the human heart for a trust-filled and lifelong union . The Catholic Church , in stating its position on homosexuality , needs to show , by word and the example of its spiritual leaders , what it truly believes about marriage between a man and woman . In responding to the crisis of pedophilia , the Catholic Church needs to do more than apologize with words . It needs to declare by the example of its spiritual leaders what a wholesome relationship with children is like , especially in family life . To fulfill this mission is the urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his pontificate , Pope John Paul II wrote eloquently about the " theology of the body . " But words alone are not enough . It is time for visible witness . It was St. Francis who advised his followers , " Preach the gospel at all times . If necessary , use words . " He knew that people learn by observing . Our world needs no more words , words , words . It longs for leaders to show us by the power of example what the Creator intended in creating sexual beings . A return to our apostolic roots by opening up ministry to a married clergy would be an eloquent profession of faith by our church that married couples are called to holiness of life . It would make no more sense to mandate that priests marry than it makes to mandate celibacy . The vocation of marriage should not be imposed but should be a response to a call from the Lord . In view of the reasons above , now would be the perfect time to bring back to active ministry all those ordained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE COUR- age of their convictions . What is rare to find are people who have the courage to reexamine their convictions . St. Peter , the first pope , had this second brand of courage . He went through much of his life regarding gentiles as unclean . He thought they were unworthy of his association . This was part of his tradition . But new circumstances ( and a dream ) forced Peter to reexamine his convictions . And he came to a new conclusion . " I begin to see how true it is that God shows no partiality " ( Acts 10:34 ) . This was such a significant change for Peter that Luke relates it twice in the Acts of the Apostles . I pray that our American bishops will somehow find the courage to reexamine their convictions . They are being asked to reexamine if they " teach as dogma mere human precepts " ( Mark 7:7 ) . Then , inspired by the bravery of our American bishops , I trust that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rule requiring celibacy for all priests . Yes , it will take courage to change . But 21st-century pastoral needs can not be answered with an 11th-century law . A law of mandatory celibacy is powerless to reverse the mentality of our present culture 's sexual sickness . It is time for a change . I believe a new Pentecost for the Catholic Church will soon be realized and a renewed excitement about human sexuality in the context of conjugal love will soon be experienced . Just imagine a time when words preached from the pulpit are spoken in a language and mirrored by an example once again understood by married couples-and young people on the way to marriage .
