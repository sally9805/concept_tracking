Perhaps you 're in an endless battle with your abs . Or you might be one of those women whose unwanted fat goes straight to her upper arms . No problem . Choose the workout that zeros in on your personal trouble zone , or do all three for a total-body makeover . Do two or three sessions a week , with at least 1 day of rest between workouts . Trust a tape measure to chart your progress . As you build muscle , remember that the scale may stay the same , but your sizes won't. 1 . LOW HOVER <p> a . Kneel on a mat with your hands under your shoulders . Extend your legs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balancing in a push-up position . Pull your abs up and in . <p> b .

TRICEPS STRETCH <p> Raise your left arm straight overhead , then bend it behind your head toward your right shoulder blade .
