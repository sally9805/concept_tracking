Winter Woman By Jenna Kernan Harlequin Enterprises , Ltd . Harlequin Enterprises , Ltd . Rocky Mountains , April 1835 The instant he saw movement , Thomas Nash reached for his Hawkins rifle . He stood knee-deep in the stream with the rifle sighted on the center of the Indian 's chest . The man raised his open hand in greeting . Flat-head , Nash thought and lowered his gun . He raised his hand as well . Damn , I hope they did n't rob my traps . " Howdy , " he said , and then he repeated his welcome in the man 's dialect . The man spoke in Flathead . " You are Nash ? " " Yes . " " We have been looking for you . " Nash glanced around but saw no other Indians . His attention focused on the man before him . " Why ? " " We have something that belongs with you . Come . " Nash 's mind briefly flicked back to the six traps he 'd dropped into the river when the Blackfoot Indians attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream and headed back up the hill . Most Indians he knew traded with or stole from trappers . He never knew one to give anything away . Nash led the way to camp . On the log beside his wigwam sat a woman wrapped in a dirty quilt . " What the hell ? " At his appearance she stood . He stared at the baggy brown dress , which appeared to belong to someone larger . Her skin was sallow and she was as skinny as a wolf in February . He 'd seen stray cats with more meat on them . Lordy , it hurt just to look at her . " We found this white woman . You are the only white man here . We brought her to you . " Nash shot a glance at the man , then pinned his gaze on the waif before him . " To me ! I do n't want her . " " Do all white women have this yellow hair ? " He glanced at her pale blond locks . " Damn few - rare as ermine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has no horse . Yet she survived the winter , alone . " " Impossible . " " Yes . Still this one survived . We do not know how . She has great powers , so she will bring you luck . " " Women do n't bring luck . I ca n't take her . " " Hunts Buffalo and I think she belongs with her people . Such a special woman deserves to go home . We would take her , only we are going to war with the Blackfoot now . Perhaps later . " Nash flapped an arm in frustration . " Well , what am I supposed to do with her ? " " Feed her . She is very hungry . " The trapper turned his hard gaze upon her . " Where 's your people ? " Cordelia Channing 's jaw dropped open . English . How long had it been since she 'd heard English ? John 's voice rose in her mind . Do n't fret Cordelia . I 'll bag an elk and be back by nightfall . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full larder . Snows come early in the mountains . And oh , how they had come . The whole world had turned gray and she 'd been buried alive in a cold white blanket . " What 's wrong ? You addled ? " His voice snapped her back to attention . " What 're you doing up here alone ? " He scowled , looking strong as a buffalo and just as dangerous . " Our wagon train was headed west . My husband meant to minister to the savages . " " Where 's he at ? " A vivid image of the last time she 'd seen John flashed in her mind . Would the memory never leave her ? Tears burned the back of her throat and brimmed in her eyes . Her lip trembled as she kept the cries buried deep in her throat . She shook her head . " Gone . " " Gone left or gone dead ? " She stared at his scowling face a moment in shock . " I found his remains last October . " Nash leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " He scratched his chin and regarded her . " Grizzly ? " Fifteen days after his disappearance she 'd found John 's body . Scavengers had eaten at his corpse . She shuddered . " I do n't know . " " I 'm real sorry for your loss , " said the trapper , his frown unwavering . Her voice sounded brittle as autumn leaves blown across bedrock . " What will happen to me now ? " " You 'll stay with me . " " Will you take me East ? " He shook his head . " Not until fall . " Her eyes flew to her rescuers . " Will they ? " " They 're going to war with the Blackfoot . You ca n't go . " The Indian she knew as Hawk Feathers squatted before her and patted her cheek . His sad eyes spoke to her . She smiled . " Thank you , " she said . " Gordeela , " he said , and lifted a hand in farewell . The other man nodded his goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap astride . In a moment they were gone , melted into the evergreens . How differently she felt seeing them go . Five days earlier , when they 'd appeared in her meadow , hope and horror mingled . They were the first human beings she 'd seen in seven months . Her food was nearly gone . Yet , she feared capture . In the end she recognized them as her last chance . Without immediate help , she 'd die beside her roofless hut and mired wagon , so she 'd crossed the meadow to meet her fate . And they 'd rescued her . The trapper pushed his wide-brimmed leather hat back on his head . She studied his eyes . They were clear blue , like a glass medicine bottle . The small lines near the corners were the only part of his face not tanned . A close-trimmed beard covered his square jaw . She guessed he was not yet thirty . His muscular body was clad entirely in soft brown buckskin . Both shirt and britches were trimmed in a long fringe . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A leather belt cinched his narrow waist and held a variety of objects including a long knife and smaller pouches . My word , he is the tallest man I 've ever seen .
