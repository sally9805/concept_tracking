Before the Germans bombed Belgium in 1940 , Tournai was a city that creaked under the weight of its own rich history . Conquered by the French , it was thought more beautiful than Paris . Conquered by the English , it was the favored city of King Henry the Eighth . It was also a city of God . One hundred bell towers , four hundred bells . So many churches , their spires teetering at odd angles , they eclipsed the narrow streets , streets filled with knots of nuns and priests moving about like so many bees . God was Tournai 's main industry . The banks , the universities , the cafes , the souvenir shops which sold the nearly authentic relics : they all thrived on God . Survived by creating a city devoted to devotion . In Tournai , God , apparently , was as common as air . The baker said he saw Him in a cherry tart . The milliner , in the eye of a peacock feather . The trash man said he saw Him tumbling down the alleyways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper cones , their twice-fried potatoes eaten long ago . These sightings of God were well documented in newspapers and radio broadcasts . They were proudly spoken of in the streets . " Did you know that the barber saw the face of the Virgin on the floor of his shop yesterday ? " " No , but I heard the butcher found a small cross within the belly of a lamb . " Everywhere , everyone saw God . How could they not ? In Tournai , seeing God was a matter of civic pride . Then bombs came . Then soldiers . Then silence . Now recruitment posters cover the church doors . Ersatz kommando der waffen ! The Germans are asking for help . Support us ! they say , and show the enemy in his " true light " a red devil , the Star of David around his neck . The devil laughs at the cross , crushes Belgium with his pitchfork . Some of the priests , their churches in rubble , ask their congregations to consider the Germans ' position . Did not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der waffen ! Since the occupation began , it is said that God has not been seen in Tournai . It is believed that He quietly slipped away . Heartbroken , He eased himself out of the situation , unsure if He would ever return .
