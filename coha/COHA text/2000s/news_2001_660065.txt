<p> Bands of vigilantes in frayed red uniforms , armed with homemade machetes , whips , and clubs , roam this poor and parched state on the edge of the Sahara , detaining anyone suspected of misconduct . The list of possible offenses is long , and justice is swift and severe . In the past year , one cattle thief lost a hand , an unwed teen mother received 100 lashes , and countless other men and women endured similar public lashings for lesser transgressions . Not surprisingly , crime has plummeted by more than half . " People here are afraid to commit crime , " says Musa Ossa , a policeman lazing around the capital 's quiet marketplace . " We do n't have many thieves anymore . " One year ago this overwhelmingly Muslim state in Nigeria 's far north adopted sharia law , a legal code based on various Islamic texts , and sparked an Islamic revival . The move has transformed Zamfara from a crime-ridden backwater to a safe , model state and catapulted its first democratically elected governor - who campaigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucrat to the darling of the Islamic world . Since that time , residents across Nigeria 's Muslim north have demanded that their newly elected state governors follow suit . So far , another 10 of Nigeria 's 36 states have announced their intention to introduce sharia law - returning the region to its pre-colonial roots , when Islamic scholars , not secular judges , meted out justice . " This is the benefit of democracy , " says Isa Ibdulsalam , an academic who is advising Kano State government on the reintroduction of sharia law . " The people can come forward and demand something . Under previous regimes , people did n't have that freedom . " But the world is n't celebrating this first tangible sign of democracy at work in Nigeria , which for the past 15 years struggled under a series of military dictatorships . From the beginning , Western governments and nongovernmental organizations called sharia law a travesty of human rights . <p> Christians react Christians , who make up half of Nigeria 's population , say sharia law has ushered in an era of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of Christians and Muslims have died in northern states preparing to institute the Islamic legal code have confirmed those fears . Many Christians here wonder aloud if this fragile new democracy can survive what they see as a " Muslim holy war . " And now some Muslims here say that sharia law has replaced their fear of crime with fear of government oppression . Consider the story of Mohammed Sani , a pious tailor who neither drinks nor smokes but nevertheless ran afoul of sharia law . Sitting behind his old sewing machine , bare feet on the metal foot pedal , Sani recalled the Friday last August when he preached to his fellow Muslims in the cavernous dusty courtyard of the capital 's main mosque . He pointed to the hundreds of banners , bumper stickers , and posters featuring the governor 's photograph and praise for sharia law . Covering buildings , cars , and public spaces , they give this state the feel of China under Mao . " This is a political campaign , " Sani told the group of men who had gathered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that sharia is from God not a governor . " Why , he asked the group , were government officials allowed to keep their satellite dishes and VCRs , when the two cinemas in town were closed ? Why were the rich not compelled to give charity to the poor , as is required under Islamic law ? Why were only the poor dragged before sharia court judges ? " Because this governor is using sharia law for his own political purposes , " Sani told them . Police quickly arrested him . " He went right into the mosque and criticized the government , " says an incredulous Umar Shitu , the judge who heard Sani 's case last September . " We tried to make him understand that he can cause anarchy . He refused to listen . We decided to put him in prison . " Sani spent four months there . " Islam does not permit someone to criticize the government , " explains Abdul Kadir Jelani , the paramount Islamic leader here and an adviser to the governor . While Islamic scholars debate that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge Shitu chilled public debate further when he jailed a well-known opposition party supporter on suspicion of throwing a stone at the governor 's convoy . In a recent interview in his dingy sharia courthouse , Shitu said with a shrug , " We were n't convinced that he threw the stone . " The man spent two weeks in jail anyway . <p> Politics vs. religion Many here are clearly disappointed - with the government , not with sharia law . A middle-aged shopkeeper too fearful to give his name said in a whisper , " We think the people are being deceived . This is not true sharia . This is for the governor . We want true sharia . " Gov . Alhaji Ahmad Sani , who was greeted with cheers on recent tours of Egypt , Pakistan , Qatar , Sudan , and Saudi Arabia , dismisses such complaints . " You can not cheat God , " the governor said in his state house office . " You can not cheat the people . God knows your heart . If I was not sincere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non-profits , and Christians in and outside Nigeria have entirely different criticisms of sharia law . These critics hold up the case of Bariya Ibrahim Magazu . A pregnant , unmarried , and illiterate teenager , Ms. Ibrahim Magazu told a sharia court judge last September that she had been coerced into having sex with three fellow villagers . When the men denied the charge , she was found guilty of fornication and sentenced to 100 lashes . Her sentence was carried out last month before a crowd of about 500 onlookers , a few weeks after the birth of her baby . Western diplomats protested . Newspapers around the world howled injustice . Frustrated Muslim leaders here say they are misunderstood . They explain that lashings are meant to serve as highly regulated public humiliations not brutal punishments . According to Zamfara state 's legal code : " ( f ) The executioner shall be of moderate physique ; ( g ) The lashes shall be of moderate force so as not to cause lacerations to the skin of the convict ; ( h ) The executioner shall hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictates that the executioner holds a book under the arm with the whip to further reduce the force of the blow . Whips , made from an arm 's length strip of stiff cowhide , are sold in most markets and commonly used by public school teachers and parents here to discipline children . Ibrahim Magazu 's village headman would not permit this reporter to interview her , her parents , or her neighbors , but insisted the punishment requirements were met . Muslim leaders argue that amputations are similarly misunderstood . Amputation is reserved for only the most egregious theft cases . Since sharia law was brought back to Zamfara in January 2000 , only one criminal has received the punishment . A cattle thief 's hand was amputated last March because he stole purely out of greed ( judges had determined that he and his family had sufficient food , housing , and clothing ) . <p> Inside a courtroom These sensational cases notwithstanding , the day-to-day workings of sharia law are actually quite boring . Traders in the market use specially marked measurement cups approved by the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around town . And everyone is supposed to dress modestly . A day of hearings in Judge Shitu 's three-room courthouse is hardly shocking . One woman explains she does n't love her husband any longer . The husband , clearly disappointed , says he wants to remain married but wo n't object if she really wants the divorce . The judge grants the divorce on the spot . One man sues another for breaking a contract . The judge tells him to bring witnesses another day . The strangest case comes at the day 's end . A woman sues a neighbor for calling her a " harlot . " The accused - who faces up to one year in prison and up to 40 lashes - denies the charge . Shitu tells the complainant that she must bring four witnesses to the next hearing . To be found guilty in sharia court , the accused must either admit their guilt or be caught in the act by no less than four witnesses . Even sharia law boosters admit this makes it a pretty ineffective punishment tool . Governor Sani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punish the guilty . It is to deter misbehavior " - with threats of hair-raising penalties . <p> Nigeria and Islam Islam first came to Nigeria before Columbus arrived in America . For hundreds of years , Muslim emirs ruling mud-walled city-states across northern Nigeria applied sharia law in civil and criminal cases . When the British Empire arrived at the turn of the 20th century sharia law continued - greatly watered down . The legal system 's death sentence came after Nigeria 's independence in 1960 , when a new national legal code allowed sharia only in civil cases . The people of Nigeria 's Muslim north , from a mix of nostalgia , religious fervor , and desperation , have called for the restoration of sharia law ever since . They see it as the clearest way out of their chaotic and corrupt condition . " Sharia will provide for the needy ones , " says Garba Umar , a farmer and ministry of agriculture employee . " Sharia will con- <p> struct roads . Sharia will construct hospitals . And Sharia will help us love one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim handyman here , talks about sharia in the same manner as Americans fed up with crime might discuss the death penalty . " Before there was no justice , " he says . " The bad people were free . The police did nothing . Now with sharia , the bad people are afraid . " Thus far the federal government has treated sharia as yet another expression of Nigeria 's religious diversity and devotion . But riots between Christians and Muslims in some northern states , in which hundreds were killed , have severely tested the federal government 's hands-off approach . The small Christian communities in northern Nigeria have been told that they will not be subject to sharia regulations . Still , demonstrations and violence have been sporadic . Brewers , bar owners , and cinema operators ( most of whom are Christian ) , have lost their livelihood in many northern states . Other Christians worry that their businesses - no matter how innocent - may be next . Many are fleeing south , says the Rev. Linus Mary B. Awuhe , president of the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an island , " Mr. Awuhe says . " They live with other people , and their laws affect us directly and indirectly . " Others are more charitable . " Christian men go out at night , and we do n't know what they are doing , " says Julie Uwanna , a Christian restaurant owner in Kano State , where sharia law is just now being implemented . " I want them to stop that . There are many diseases these days , like AIDS . I will like sharia if it keeps our husbands home . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
