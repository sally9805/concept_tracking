<p> Harry Williams looks at the perfect cluster of glassware he 's placed on his built-in dining room shelves . He wonders whether it 's just a tad too Pottery Barn . <p> Williams and his wife , Becky Katano , both work for the housewares giant and just bought a modest Mediterranean house in Sunnyside , a small San Francisco neighborhood squeezed between City College and Interstate 280 . Until recently , Sunnyside was not the place of Pottery Barn dreams . It was more the stuff of the Sears Catalog . <p> As San Francisco 's median home price approaches $800,000 , it was inevitable that even a place as working class as Sunnyside would be discovered  --  and , with time , reinvented . Even though there are signs that real estate sales are slowing , the prices in the region are still astronomical . <p> That 's why young home buyers like Williams and Katano are claiming their spot in Sunnyside 's odd assemblage of ' 60s duplexes and turn-of-the-century cottages , trending up yet another neighborhood in a city where affordable space is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening in Sunnyside is emblematic of what 's happening all over the Bay Area : Home buyers are being forced to search for under-the-radar , blue-collar communities , sometimes even crime-ridden neighborhoods  --  if they want to stay . <p> And San Francisco is at the center of it all , providing the clearest picture of how housing prices can throw an area 's demographics for a loop . Middle-class families with children are leaving because they can get more for their money outside the city . Now , most home buyers are couples in their 20s , 30s and 40s who make six-figure incomes . <p> From Page A1 : The transformation of Sunnyside is the clearest sign yet that the city is being gentrified to the point where it 's shedding its working-class roots and becoming a veritable five-star hotel . <p> " There is no question that this is the town of the haves , " said Suzy Reily , a real estate agent for Zephyr in Noe Valley . " There are no deals in San Francisco . The deal is having a house . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all over the world to rent affordable flats in run-down Victorians in the Haight , to start families in tiny Noe Valley Edwardians , and to discuss social issues over cheap cups of coffee in North Beach . <p> But over the years , the Victorians have been tarted up to cash in on the gold-rush market . Parents have been packing up their kids and moving them across the bay . And any deep discussions at the coffee houses better be brief  --  there are no free refills . <p> When Williams and Katano first moved to San Francisco from Columbus , Ohio , they rented a flat on Russian Hill with views of the bay and Coit Tower and the picturesque tableau of the cable car running up and down their street . The couple felt like they were living in postcard San Francisco . But even with their combined six-figure salary , they could n't afford to own that life . <p> That 's how they ended up in Sunnyside . There , a two-bedroom , one-bath detached home lists on average in the $600,000 range and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting last week , homeowners were buzzing over an agent 's prediction that a recently renovated single-family house just put on the market would sell for more than $1 million . <p> But those prices are relatively new for the subdivision . For the past 60 years , while the communities around the working-class neighborhood went through major identity changes to meet the demand of the growing real estate market , Sunnyside remained mostly the same . <p> Children of Sunnyside homeowners raised their kids in the same sturdy cottages where they grew up . While other neighborhoods like Noe Valley and South of Market sprouted fine restaurants and rarefied boutiques , Sunnyside was content with its one-chair barbershop and utilitarian Safeway . <p> Even though Sunnyside was considered a safe neighborhood  --  " You can walk your dog at 2 a.m. and you 're going to make it home , " one agent said  --  it was a wallflower surrounded by prom queens : St. Francis Wood with its stately homes , vibrant West Portal and fashionable Glen Park . <p> " Sunnyside just does n't have the latte factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate agent Reily , who represented Williams and Katano . <p> But there is already evidence that with the new wave of young , prosperous people moving in , the community is changing . <p> " When people realize they ca n't afford Noe Valley , they go to Bernal Heights . When they realize they ca n't afford Bernal Heights , they go to Glen Park . When they realize they ca n't afford Glen Park , they 're going to come to Sunnyside , " said Adrian Kim , a real estate agent who was holding an open house on Judson Avenue in Sunnyside one recent Sunday . <p> On Monterey Boulevard , the neighborhood 's main commercial street , an Irish pub has been replaced by Silk Road , a fashion studio . Owners Victor and Michelle Tung design and sell Asian-influenced clothing , dyed scarves and hand-made jewelry . Outfits sell from $425 to $700 . In a building out back , the couple has set up a teahouse , where they hold tea-drinking ceremonies for customers . <p> " We 're trying to become a Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the former bar 's concrete backyard , where patrons went to smoke , spit and brawl , there is a Zen garden and fountain . <p> Tung , who is originally from Taiwan , holds a master 's degree in business . His wife was a doctor in China . <p> " This place used to be not that interesting , " Tung said as he looked down Monterey . " But I do see the potential . People here do appreciate beautiful things , and more and more young professionals are moving in . " <p> And as they do , people like Joe Pasternak worry . He fears that his one-chair barbershop on Monterey , where the clientele consists entirely of walk-ins , will become too expensive to operate . <p> He has seen it happen before . When things got hot in his Inner Sunset neighborhood , rents went up  --  and more upscale shops moved in . <p> Sunnyside , according to local historian Woody LaBounty , began as a get-rich-quick scheme . In 1890 , Behrend Joost bought 2,250 San Francisco lots from big-shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the creme de la creme of San Francisco subdivisions , " according to his advertisement . He even gave his creation its very own name  --  Sunnyside . <p> But by 1900 , only 5 percent of the lots had been sold , and Joost 's dreams of striking it rich in the suburbs were dashed . Maybe people did n't want to live too close to the city 's jail , which was located where San Francisco City College is now . Maybe it was the gambling halls and roadhouses on Ocean Avenue a few miles away that scared away squeamish families . Or maybe it was that Sunnyside just was n't all that sunny , but rather cold and foggy . <p> Eventually , after the 1906 earthquake and two world wars created a housing shortage in the city , working-class families began trickling into the neighborhood . <p> To LaBounty , Sunnyside represented the opposite of the glittery side of San Francisco , the unheralded backbone of a city famous for its intellectuals and sophistication . <p> " A lot of these homes were built to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's where working-class Irish Catholics and Italians lived and went to church . It was sort of the gateway from the working class to the very high-end enclaves . " <p> Cynthia Dragon is part of the neighborhood 's old guard . When she and her husband moved to Sunnyside 27 years ago , the working-class couple bought a one-bedroom cottage for $35,000 . The first year they were there , the Dragons turned their place into a haunted house for Halloween and were an instant hit with the local children . Her neighbors became her lifelong friends , and she watched their kids grow up along with her own . But as time went on , many of them sold to cash in on the red-hot market and left San Francisco . <p> That 's not the case with Sunnyside resident Eddy Downing , 40 , who has lived in his 100-year-old two-story bungalow on Hearst Avenue practically his whole life . <p> He , too , remembers Sunnyside as a working-class neighborhood  --  one with a colorful past . As a young boy , peeking through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of Hells Angels in front of his house . His neighbor , Bob Roberts , was the chapter president of the motorcycle gang at the time . <p> " They were all laying face down on the sidewalk with their hands cuffed behind their backs , " Downing said . " My mom yanked me back from that window so fast . " <p> Back then , every Friday night , the bikers would go whizzing down the street on their Harley-Davidsons . These days , the members of the motorcycle gang  --  at least the few who are around  --  have blended into the scenery . <p> Roberts still lives on Downing 's block . His black house used to stand out among the whites , browns and reds of the other homes in the neighborhood . Now he 's repainted it a more subdued dusty rose . He 's even doing interviews on VH1 . <p> Mike Anderson has also lived in Sunnyside all his life . The 21-year-old 's parents used to run an upholstery shop out of his house . His dad has since moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pablo . <p> Anderson and his adult siblings share the house . In today 's market , they certainly could n't afford to buy it . They are part of a subset of Bay Area residents who continue to live in their family homes  --  either with their parents or long after their parents have died or moved away  --  because it 's the only way they can afford to stay in the region . <p> And while Sunnyside was once a place where it was common to find moms , dads , adult children and grandchildren all living under the same roof , Anderson has noticed that the cheery sounds of pitter-patter on the pavement are practically nonexistent . <p> " When I was growing up , there were a lot of kids playing in the street , " Anderson said . " But now , there 's hardly any . " <p> From 1990 to 2004 , San Francisco 's overall population grew 3 percent , according to the most recent U.S. Census data . But during those years , the city saw its child population diminish by 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From 1990 to 2000 , the proportion of households with children decreased from 21 percent to 19 percent , according to the Public Research Institute at San Francisco State University , which studied the exodus at the behest of city officials . <p> " We now hold the distinction of having the fewest children per capita of any major county in the United States , " Mayor Gavin Newsom announced in a statement unveiling the city 's plan to research and stop the departure . " And since families with young children are not staying in the city , we are very likely looking at an even greater decline of households with children over time . " <p> Some argue that if housing prices continue to rise at such a pace , other cities in the Bay Area will also become too pricey to lure families . Already , more and more families are opting for spots like Antioch instead of Oakland ; Morgan Hill instead of San Jose ; Rohnert Park instead of Petaluma . <p> The Public Research Institute surveyed 738 parents in San Francisco this year . Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city a better place to live . Another 20 percent wanted more affordable housing and cheaper living costs . <p> " My best guess for this change has a lot to do with the jobs that are available here and who they attract , " Jasper Rubin , a city planner and census coordinator , said of San Francisco and its proximity to the high-tech world of Silicon Valley . He also suspects that it has a lot to do with the lack of affordable housing stock for families . <p> Census data show that San Francisco has the highest median home value among the 70 largest cities in the nation , about $100,000 higher than San Jose , which is second . And San Francisco 's median monthly housing cost for renters is the second highest , just behind San Jose . <p> Chuck Lewkowitz , owner of Sunnyside 's McKeever Realty , estimates that to buy a $700,000 house in San Francisco , even after paying a 20 percent down payment , a buyer has to earn between $135,000 and $150,000 a year to qualify for a 30-year fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places in the Bay Area . <p> Consequently , real estate in the region has become a top investment . Dragon and Downing have watched as the modest homes that line Sunnyside 's flat streets got face-lifts . <p> Downing points to houses on his block . They 've all been freshly painted in colors with names like federalist blue , colonial red and Queen Anne pink . <p> " New people just moved into that one , " Downing said . " That one over there just got sold . Those people moved in about a year ago . " <p> People all over the Bay Area are taking their starter homes and slapping on second stories , adding garages , landscaping their yards and renovating their kitchens in a decidedly nonblue-collar way  --  Wolf stoves , granite countertops and subzero refrigerators . <p> Williams , 35 , and Katano , 41 , both designers for Pottery Barn  --  Williams creates the windows for the chain 's flagship stores , and Katano helps develop new products for the teen catalog  --  already have big plans for their small Sunnyside two-bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to add more cabinets to a bare wall in their kitchen and rehabilitate the dilapidated garage . Eventually , they 'd like to sell the house and make enough profit to move to Katano 's native Hawaii . They knew they could n't do that in Ohio . <p> " We knew we needed to get equity to move to Hawaii , " Katano said . " And we knew we could never get jobs like this there . " <p> After looking for several months in San Francisco , the couple could n't believe the prices here . In fact , they became resigned to the idea of buying outside the city with an eye toward Pacifica . Then their agent suggested Sunnyside . <p> Within days , Katano found their little Mediterranean on Staples Street . " It was definitely not our dream house , " Williams said . " It was just what we could afford . " <p> They purchased it from Nick Kaskanlian , an entrepreneur , who had bought the home with the express purpose of fixing it up and reselling it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint and filled the unlandscaped backyard with redwood chips in the five months that he owned the place . Then he sold the house to Williams and Katano for roughly $35,000 more than he paid for it . <p> Kaskanlian , along with his brother , flips houses throughout San Francisco . It 's a business that contractors and real estate speculators have found pays off in the Bay Area 's booming market . However , it 's becoming more difficult for even these savvy investors to find deals . <p> Lewkowitz , the Sunnyside real estate agent , said he remembers not too long ago when you could buy a decent home in the neighborhood for about $500,000 . <p> " Not anymore , " he said , adding that he is seeing the escalation in home prices even in neighborhoods perceived as high-crime areas . <p> " Look at this one : A one-bedroom , one-bath contractor 's special in the Bayview for $399,000 , " he said while scrolling through the multiple listing service . <p> Reily said she remembers 10 years ago when buyers would n't consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulevard . " They thought it was too dangerous , " she said . <p> She predicts that after Sunnyside becomes completely unaffordable , the next hot spot will surely be the Bayview . Reily said a soon-to-be created Third Street light-rail train has already lured speculators into the once blighted neighborhood , and she 's sure that home buyers will follow . <p> It happened at Jack London Square in Oakland , 4th Street in Berkeley and South of Market in San Francisco . And some say there are few places left to go . <p> " I feel that in a couple of years , Sunnyside will just be an extension of Glen Park , " Reily said . " Now people are going to little pockets everywhere . " <p> CHART : <p> Last chance for the middle-class homebuyer ?
