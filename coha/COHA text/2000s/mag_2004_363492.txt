If you want to understand why General Wesley Clark is causing heartburn in the Dean camp , it 's worth studying how much the guy who is running as the un-Dean actually resembles him . Both men make the most of their hard-earned titles : the doctor and the general are conspicuously not Senators ; they barely admit to being politicians at all . Their innocence of national elective experience is a virtue . Their tough temperaments and raw styles are suited to a Democratic base alienated by dignified leaders in Washington who got rolled by the Bush revolution . Neither has any embarrassing votes to explain  --  for a war , a tax cut , a budget . Both have sucked in unprecedented amounts of cash , Dean in little squirts from his many online allies , Clark from the deep gushing pockets of party patrons who will pay any price to stop Dean before it 's too late . Dean raised $15 million in the last quarter , Clark $10 million , and no other Democrat was close . <P> In fact the spin from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Dean as that he is Dean 2.0smarter , faster , fewer bugs . He is protected from attacks on patriotism in ways Dean is not , even as Clark attacks President Bush for not preventing the 9/11 attacks and brags that had he been President , he would have caught Osama by now . As a centrist from Arkansas who has probably voted for as many Republicans as Democrats , Clark may be one of the few true swing voters left . Having sharpened his stump speech and softened his style , Clark is taking advantage of all the empty space up on the New Hampshire stage to deliver his message to the unsure and the undecided  --  18% , according to a poll taken for the Concord Monitor . If all this Dean talk is making you nervous , he says , give me a chance to give you a choice . <P> Clark came ripping into the race in September claiming to answer the call of desperate Democrats  --  particularly the pragmatists who fear Bush more than they admire Dean and do n't want to waste a vote just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bash George Bush , " Clark says . " I 'm running to replace him . " With no campaign experience or political record to run on , Clark had to introduce himself to Democratic voters , who , he acknowledges , are less accustomed than Republicans to seeing a general in their race ; he still needs to prove that he is the Democrats ' Eisenhower , not their Al Haig . <P> At the moment , Clark 's apparent passing of John Kerry in New Hampshire and his success hauling Dean down into a statistical dead heat nationally in some polls give the race a new and livelier feel , especially since Clark 's numbers are climbing as others are falling at just the moment when momentum matters . The size of Clark 's crowds has grown sharply in recent weeks to rival Dean 's . That is bad news for the doctor , who needs the pack of candidates below him to stay muddled so no clear alternative rises to win over the two-thirds of Democrats who do n't currently plan to vote for him . Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out flyers noting that Clark did n't register as a Democrat until last October and questioning his wobbly stance on the Iraq war . But Clark is ready for that , even relishing it . Asked by a woman at a Dartmouth rally whether he was really a Republican in sheep 's clothing , he zinged back , " I never really thought of Democrats as sheep . "
