CLOSE-UP Anthony Bourdain , the chef who whipped up Kitchen Confidential , devours cobra and iguana for a new book and TV series . by Karen Valby Photograph THERE 'S THE GRUB Bourdain in New York 's Chinatown // IN LAST YEAR 'S BRASH **29;1454;TOOLONG memoir Kitchen Confidential , veteran New York City chef Anthony Bourdain warned restaurant patrons about the perils of hollandaise sauce , mussels , and fish on Mondays . Those unsavory sound bites , delivered everywhere from Nightline to Oprah , helped propel his book to a 14-week run on the New York Times best-seller list . " I was stunned , " says Bourdain . " It 's a best-seller in Germany , for God 's sake ! Little old ladies come up to me now , and I 'm like , " You should be ashamed of yourself for liking that filthy , foul , hyperbolic book . " ' Now the civilized world is about to get a second helping . At 6 ' ' 4 " , in a beat-up leather jacket , cowboy boots , and a gold hoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grill man . As he looms outside Manhattan 's Barney Greengrass , proud home of the Sturgeon King , he sucks on one last Lark cigarette ( three packs a day since age 13-never mind that it kills the taste buds , he says , that 's what salt is for ) before heading inside for breakfast . The man 's here to eat ; less appetizing to him is the notion that with a new book and a television series around the corner , he has left behind the relatively safe confines of the kitchen and entered the dicier world of fame . " Oh , I really hate the concept of celebrity chefs , " he says . " I know chefs who are getting voice coaches now ! I have enough reasons to hate myself without looking at myself in the mirror and saying " I employ a hairstylist . " " But Bourdain , a former heroin addict who describes himself as a reformed " lying , thieving , junkie scumbag , " is n't about to thumb his nose at a good score . The success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few chefs ever enjoy . His credit cards are no longer rejected when he and his wife of 16 years , Nancy , go out to dinner ; he has two nice suit jackets for television ; and his hands have healed up from 28 years of kitchen abuse . " It 's bittersweet . I miss my cooks , I miss the life , but at the end of the day , this is a hell of a lot easier than cleaning squid for the lunch rush . What , I 'm going to complain about having a book that did well when I get to go to Vietnam and order boat drinks by the pool and eat fabulous foods ? " Bourdain spent the last year and a half jetting from one exotic locale to another , sampling the world 's delicacies for A Cook 's Tour : In Search of the Perfect Meal ( Bloomsbury , $25.95 ) . He choked down charred iguana in Mexico , gnawed on cobra heart in Saigon , and braved poisonous blowfish in Japan . All the while , two people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Network will showcase his journey in a 22-part series that premieres Jan. 8 . " It 's a manic-depressive show , " he says . " I 'm really happy in one shot , and in the next I 'm sweaty , sick to my stomach , and angry . " The many locals he encountered typically wanted the lone American to sample their local brew to excess , so Bourdain guesses he was dead drunk for half the tour . " I 'm not exactly prime-time material , " he shrugs . " I can only guess that some sinister cabal of criminally deranged anarchists within the Food Network let this in under the radar . " " Poor Tony , " says Eileen Opatut , the Food Network 's senior VP of programming and production . " While I admire his desire to be an anarchist and a rebel , he fits right in here . We love him precisely because he 's not easy to turn into fluff . Although we did have to bleep him out a little . " Despite his entre into the Food Network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable of stars . He 's called Emeril Lagasse " Ewok-like " and Jamie Oliver ( whose hit show The Naked Chef will precede his time slot ) a " pretty-boy model who was probably beaten up in prep school . " " There 's no danger , I hope , of me becoming a beloved staple of the Food Network . I wo n't be doing tailgate parties with Bobby Flay , " he promises . " I have already instructed my former sous-chef that if he ever hears of anything like that , he is to sneak up behind me and shoot me in the back of the head . " When Bourdain 's new life overwhelms him , he retreats to his center of gravity , his old kitchen at Brasserie Les Halles , where he 's worked as executive chef since 1996 but makes it in only a few nights a month now . There 's a table of eight women out front , a reading group that 's oohing over Kitchen Confidential , so Bourdain stays hidden in the back with his buddies . Tonight 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak frites and slabs of foie gras hitting the deck . The narrow space is a cacophony of sizzle and profanity . " This motherf  --  er we call El Guapo , the handsome one , " Bourdain says , gesturing . " Your average busboy does n't have that rottweiler gleam in his eye , those wide shoulders suitable for knocking down enemies . And this is Armando , he used to be the leather guy in the Village People but now he 's our best waiter-and , of course , like most really good waiters , he 's also our biggest pain in the ass . " Photograph TOUR GUIDE The Food Network filmed Bourdain 's travels to ( 1 ) Japan and ( 2 ) Cambodia // Bourdain 's crew can give as good as it gets , ripping into him about his clothes , his habit of dragging reporters back into their space , his sudden fame . When he returns from a tour of the restaurant 's food supplies downstairs , he takes a swig of a beer he naively left unattended . " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellows as the fry cook in the corner feigns interest in the stove . " You motherf  --  ers ! As long as there 's no bodily fluids in there I 'm okay . " There 's love in this room . Bourdain seems more blown away by the day  --  to-day feats of his broiler guy or his dishwasher than by the notion that Brad Pitt may play him in David Fincher 's movie adaptation of Kitchen Confidential . " That 's an abstract concept in my mind , " he says . " I would love to see a mass-market paperback with Brad Pitt 's face on it , not mine . And having read the screenplay , which is really good , I can see him . But see , I 'm already in the danger zone because I 'm buying in , I 'm hoping . " Chefs are a superstitious bunch , he explains , people with cynicism and a sense of impending doom bled into their bones . " My daily life is very much informed by the knowledge that I am one lucky motherf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect , that my 15 minutes could run out at any time . I could be cooking brunch again next year . And I would n't be too unhappy about it . " <p>
