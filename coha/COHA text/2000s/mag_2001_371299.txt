When U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld turned up at an ornate royal palace in Saudi Arabia last week , he shook hands with ailing King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al Saud and then exchanged views about the war on terrorism with Crown Prince Abdullah , who runs the kingdom 's day-to-day affairs . Rumsfeld might have got a somewhat different perspective if he had stopped by al Masaa , a cafe in the heart of the capital , where patrons hail Osama bin Laden as an Arab hero . <P> The terrace is crammed with young men , some in traditional cotton robes and Bedouin headdress , others in Western jeans and T shirts . They are watching teenage drivers peeling rubber through traffic , calling friends on cell phones and discussing Osama . Sipping cappuccinos and downing milk shakes , they admit to mixed feelings about last month 's devastating attacks on the U.S. because of the innocent lives that were taken . They even wonder whether it was really Osama who did it ( " I hope that it was , " says one ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. pay a price for what they see as arrogant meddling in the Middle East , particularly in supporting Israel against the Palestinians . <P> " Osama is a very , very , very , very good Muslim , " says Feras Bukhamsin , 24 , a bank clerk . Agrees Bader , 25 , a businessman who declines to give his full name : " He 's a good guy . He has millions , but he does n't care about money or himself . He 's just looking to get justice for the Arabs . " The other six Saudis around the table , some recently returned from studies in the U.S. , nod their heads . <P> What kind of ally is a country whose leaders profess solidarity with the U.S. but whose people  --  apparently some of them , anyway  --  commit mass murder on American soil , or sit around Riyadh coffee shops applauding those who do ? Answer : an uneasy one . As it moves toward military action , the U.S. remains concerned about popular unrest in Arab and Islamic states around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , that alarms went off on Saturday , when a bomb exploded outside a shop in the Saudi city of Khobar , killing two . Initial reports , however , were that the incident was unrelated to the Sept. 11 attacks . ) And as in the Gulf War , the U.S. has a tricky balance to strike between its long-term , irrevocable commitment to Israel and its short-term interest in placating the Arab street . Washington clearly sees a need for buttressing friendly Muslim regimes in the crisis . Former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Wyche Fowler warns against assuming that " monarchs can do anything they want without consequences from a restless or dissident citizenry. "
