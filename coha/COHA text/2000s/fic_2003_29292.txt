PROLOGUE The Back Garden THE SCARY PART , Jack decided , was going to be driving . He 'd already bought a Jaguar-pronounced jag-you-ah over here , he 'd have to remember-but both times he 'd walked to it at the dealership , he 'd gone to the left-front door instead of the right . The dealer had n't laughed at him , but Ryan was sure he 'd wanted to . At least he had n't climbed into the passenger seat by mistake and really made an ass of himself . He 'd have to remember all that : The " right " side of the road was the left . A right turn crossed oncoming traffic , not a left turn . The left lane was the slow lane on the interstates-motorways , he corrected himself . The plugs in the wall were all cockeyed . The house did n't have central heating , despite the princely price he 'd paid for it . There was no air-conditioning , though that probably was n't necessary here . It was n't the hottest of climates : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topped 75 . Jack wondered what the D.C. climate would do to them . Evidently , the " mad dogs and Englishmen " ditty was a thing of the past . But it could have been worse . He did have a pass to shop for food at the Army-Air Force Exchange Service-otherwise known as the PX at nearby Greenham Commons Air Base-so at least they 'd have proper hot dogs , and brands that resembled the ones he bought at the Giant at home in Maryland . So many other discordant notes . British television was different , of course , not that he really expected much chance to vegetate in front of the phosphor screen anymore , but little Sally needed her ration of cartoons . Besides , even when you were reading something important , the background chatter of some mindless show was comforting in its own way . The TV news was n't too bad , though , and the newspapers were particularly good-better than those he normally read at home , on the whole , but he 'd miss the morning Far Side . Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy it at the train station kiosk . He had to keep track of baseball anyway . The movers-removers , he reminded himself-were beavering away under Cathy 's direction . It was n't a bad house , though smaller than their place at Peregrine Cliff , now rented to a Marine colonel teaching the earnest young boys and girls at the Naval Academy . The master bedroom overlooked what seemed to be about a quarter-acre of garden . The realtor had been particularly enthused about that . And the previous owners had spent a lot of time there : It was wall-to-wall roses , mainly red and white , to honor the houses of Lancaster and York , it would seem . There were pink ones in between to show that they 'd joined together to form the Tudors , though that house had died out with Elizabeth I-and ultimately made way for the new set of Royals , whom Ryan had ample reason to like . And the weather was n't bad at all . They 'd been in country three days and it had n't rained at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter , he 'd heard , it never came up and immediately went back down again . Some of the new friends he 'd made at the State Department had told him that the long nights could be hard on the little kids . At four years and six months , Sally still qualified for that . Five-month-old Jack probably did n't notice such things , and fortunately , he slept just fine-he was doing so right now , in fact , in the custody of his nanny , Margaret van der Beek , a young redhead and daughter of a Methodist minister in South Africa . She 'd come highly recommended . . . and then had been cleared by a background check performed by the Metropolitan Police . Cathy was a little concerned about the whole idea of a nanny . The idea of somebody else raising her infant grated on her like fingernails on a chalkboard , but it was an honored local custom , and it had worked out pretty well for one Winston Spencer Churchill . Miss Margaret had been vetted through Sir Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctioned by Her Majesty 's government . Which meant precisely nothing , Jack reminded himself . He 'd been thoroughly briefed in the weeks before coming over . The " opposition " -a British term also used at Langley-had penetrated the British intelligence community more than once . CIA believed they had n't done so at Langley yet , but Jack had to wonder about that . KGB was pretty damned good , and people were greedy all over the world . The Russians did n't pay very well , but some people sold their souls and their freedom for peanuts . They also did n't carry a flashing sign on their clothing that said I AM A TRAITOR . Of all his briefings , the security ones had been the most tiresome . Jack 's dad had been the cop in the family , and Ryan himself had never quite mastered that mode of thinking . It was one thing to look for hard data amid the cascade of crap that worked its way up the intelligence system , quite another to look with suspicion at everyone in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if any of the others regarded him that way . . . probably not , he decided . He 'd paid his dues the hard way , after all , and had the pale scars on his shoulder to prove it , not to mention the nightmares of that night on Chesapeake Bay , the dreams in which his weapon never fired despite his efforts , Cathy 's frantic cries of terror and alarm ringing in his ears . He 'd won that battle , had n't he ? Why did the dreams think otherwise ? Something to talk to a pshrink about , perhaps , but as the old wives ' tale went , you had to be crazy to go to a pshrink . . . . Sally was running about in circles , looking at her new bedroom , admiring the new bed being assembled by the removers . Jack kept out of the way . Cathy had told him he was unfitted even to supervise this sort of thing , despite his tool kit , without which no American male feels very manly , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own tools , of course-and they , too , had been vetted by SIS , lest some KGB-controlled agent plant a bug in the house . It just would n't do , old boy . " Where 's the tourist ? " an American voice asked . Ryan went to the foyer to see who it- " Dan ! How the hell are you ? " " It was a boring day at the office , so Liz and I came out to see how things are going for you . " And sure enough , just behind the Legal Attach was his beauty-queen wife , the long-suffering St. Liz of the FBI Wives . Mrs. Murray went over to Cathy for a sisterly hug and kiss , then the two of them went immediately off to the garden . Cathy loved the roses , of course , which was fine with Jack . His dad had carried all the gardening genes in the Ryan family , and passed on none to his son . Murray gazed at his friend . " You look like hell . " " Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't you sleep on the way across ? " Murray asked in surprise . " On an airplane ? " Ryan responded . " It bothers you that much ? " " Dan , on a ship , you can see what 's holding you up . Not in an airplane . " That gave Murray a chuckle . " Better get used to it , bud . You 're gon na be building up a lot of frequent-flyer miles hopping back and forth to Dulles . " " I suppose . " Strangely , Jack had n't really considered that when he 'd accepted the posting . Dumb , he 'd realized too late . He 'd be going back and forth to Langley at least once a month-not the greatest thing for a reluctant flyer . " The moving going okay ? You can trust this bunch , you know . Bas has used them for twenty-plus years , my friends at the Yard like them , too . Half of these guys are ex-cops . " And cops , he did n't have to say , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom ? Great , " Ryan observed . During his very short experience of it so far , Ryan had learned that life in the intelligence service was a little different from teaching history at the Naval Academy . There probably were bugs-but wired to Basil 's office . . . " I know . Me , too . Good news , though : You 'll be seeing a lot of me-if you do n't mind . " Ryan nodded tiredly , trying to manage a grin . " Well , at least I 'll have somebody to have a beer with . " " That 's the national sport . More business gets done in pubs than at the office . Their version of the country club . " " The beer 's not too bad . " " Better than the piss we have at home . I 'm fully converted on that score . " " They told me at Langley that you do a lot of intel work for Emil Jacobs . " " Some . " Murray nodded . " Fact of the matter is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agency types . The Operations people have n't recovered from seventy-seven yet , and I 'm not sure that 'll happen for a while . " Ryan had to agree . " Admiral Greer thinks so , too . Bob Ritter is pretty smart-maybe a little too smart , if you know what I mean-but he does n't have enough friends in Congress to get his empire expanded the way that he wants . " Greer was the CIA 's chief analyst , Ritter the Ops director . The two were often at odds . " They do n't trust Ritter like they do the DDI . Carryover from the Church Committee mess ten years ago . You know , the Senate never seems to remember who ran those operations . They canonize the boss and crucify the troops who tried to follow his orders-though badly . Damn , was that a- " Murray searched for the word . " The Germans call it a schweinerei . No translation , exactly , but , you know , it just sounds like what it is . " Jack grunted with amusement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's effort to assassinate Fidel Castro , which had been run out of the office of the Attorney General during the time of Camelot , had been right out of Woody Woodpecker , with a sprinkling of the Three Stooges : politicians trying to imitate James Bond , a character made up by a failed Brit spook . The movies just were n't the real world , as Ryan had learned the hard way , first in London , and then in his own living room . " So , Dan , how good are they really ? " " The Brits ? " Murray led Ryan out onto the front lawn . The removers were vetted by SIS-but Murray was FBI . " Basil is world-class . That 's why he 's lasted so long . He was a brilliant field spook , and he was the first guy to get a bad vibe about Philby-and remember , Basil was just a rookie then . He 's good at administration , one of the most agile thinkers I 've ever come across . The local politicians on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't easy . Kinda like Hoover was for us once , but without the cult-of-personality thing . I like him . Good dude to work with . And Bas likes you a lot , Jack . " " Why ? " Ryan asked . " I have n't done much of anything . " " Bas has an eye for talent . He thinks you have the right stuff . He flat loved that thing you dreamed up last year to catch security leaks-the Canary Trap-and rescuing their next king did n't exactly hurt , y'know ? You 're going to be a popular boy down at Century House . If you live up to your billing , you might just have a future in the spook business . " " Great . " Ryan still was n't entirely sure that was what he wanted to do , though . " Dan , I 'm a stockbroker who turned into a history teacher , remember ? " " Jack , that 's behind you now . Look forward , will ya ? You were pretty good picking stocks at Merrill Lynch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ryan admitted . Actually , it was a lot of bucks , and his portfolio was still growing . People were getting fat on The Street back home . " So , apply your brains to something really important , " Dan suggested . " I hate to tell you , Jack , but there are n't that many smart people in the intelligence community . I know . I work there . A lot of drones , a lot of moderately smart people , but damned few stars , pal . You have the stuff to be a star . Jim Greer thinks so . So does Basil . You think outside the box . I do , too . That 's why I 'm not chasing bank robbers in Riverside , Philadelphia , anymore . But I never made any million bucks playing the market . " " Getting lucky does n't make you a great guy , Dan . Hell , Cathy 's dad , Joe , has made a lot more ' n I ever will , and he 's an opinionated , overbearing son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter the wife of an honorary knight , did n't you ? " Jack smiled sheepishly . " Yeah , I suppose I did . " " That 'll open a lot of doors over here , Jack . The Brits do like their titles . " He paused . " Now-how about I drag you guys out for a pint ? There 's a nice pub up the hill , The Gypsy Moth . This moving stuff 'll drive you crazy . It 's almost as bad as building a house . " HIS OFFICE WAS in the first basement level of The Centre , a security measure that had never been explained to him , but it turned out there was an exact counterpart room in the headquarters of the Main Enemy . There , it was called MERCURY , messenger of the gods-very apt , if his nation acknowledged the concept of a god . The messages passed through the code and cipher clerks , came to his desk , and he examined them for content and code words , before routing them to the proper offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back down , he routed things the other way . The traffic broke into a regular routine ; mornings were usually inbound traffic and afternoons usually outbound . The tedious part was the encrypting , of course , since so many of the people out in the field used one-time pads unique to themselves-the single copies of those pads were located in the set of rooms to his right . The clerks in there transmitted and kept secrets ranging from the sex lives of Italian parliamentarians to the precise targeting hierarchy of American nuclear-strike plans . Strangely , none of them talked about what they did or what they encrypted , inbound or outbound . The clerks were pretty mindless . Perhaps they were recruited with those psychological factors in mind-it would not have surprised him . This was an agency designed by geniuses for operation by robots . If someone could actually build such robots , he was sure they 'd have them here , because you could trust machines not to diverge too greatly from their intended path . Machines could n't think , however , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the agency was to function-and function it must . It was the shield and the sword of a state which needed both . And he was the postmaster of sorts ; he had to remember what went where . He did n't know everything that went on here , but he knew a lot more than most people in this building : operation names and locations , and , often enough , operational missions and taskings . He generally did not know the proper names and faces of field officers , but he knew their targets , knew the code names of their recruited agents , and , for the most part , knew what those agents were providing . He 'd been here , in this department , for nine and a half years . He 'd started in 1973 , just after graduating from Moscow State University with a degree in mathematics , and his highly disciplined mind had gotten him spotted early on by a KGB talent scout . He played a particularly fine game of chess , and that , he supposed , was where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the games of the old grandmasters , so that in a given situation he 'd know the next move . He 'd actually thought of making chess his career , but though he 'd studied hard , it was n't quite hard enough , it seemed . Boris Spassky , just a young player himself then , had annihilated him six games to none , with two desperate draws , and so ended his hopes of fame and fortune . . . and travel . He sighed at his desk . Travel . He 'd studied his geography books , too , and in closing his eyes could see the images-mainly black-and-white : Venice 's Grand Canal , London 's Regent Street , Rio de Janeiro 's magnificent Copacabana beach , the face of Mt . Everest , which Hillary had climbed when he himself had just been learning to walk . . . all those places he would never get to see . Not him . Not a person with his access and his security clearances . No , KGB was very careful with such people . It trusted no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . What was it about his country that so many tried to escape from it ? And yet so many millions had died fighting for the rodina . . . . He 'd been spared military service because of his mathematics and his chess potential , and then , he supposed , because of his recruitment to #2 Dzerzhinskiy Square . Along with it came a nice flat , fully seventy-five square meters , in a recently finished building . Military rank , too-he 'd become a senior captain within weeks of his majority , which , on the whole , was n't too bad . Even better , he 'd just started getting paid now in certificate rubles , and so was able to shop in the " closed " stores for Western consumer goods-and , best of all , with shorter lines . His wife appreciated that . He 'd soon be in the entry level of the nomenklatura , like a minor czarist prince , looking up the ladder and wondering how far he might climb . But unlike the czars , he was here not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain Zaitzev thought . Yes , he 'd earned his way here , and that was important . That 's why he was trusted with secrets , this one for example : an agent code-named CASSIUS , an American living in Washington ; it seemed he had access to valuable political intelligence that was treasured by people on the fifth floor , and which was often seconded to experts in the U.S.-Canada Institute , which studied the tea leaves in America . Canada was n't very important to the KGB , except for its participation in the American air-defense systems , and because some of its senior politicians did n't like their powerful southern neighbor , or so the rezident in Ottawa regularly told his superiors upstairs . Zaitzev wondered about that . The Poles might not love their eastern neighbor either , but the Poles mostly did what they were told-the Warsaw rezident had reported with unconcealed pleasure in his dispatch the previous month-as that union hothead had found out to his discomfort . " Counterrevolutionary scum " had been the term used by Colonel Igor Alekseyevich Tomachevskiy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due for a posting to the West . That 's where the really good ones went . TWO AND A half miles across town , Ed Foley was first in the door , with his wife , Mary Patricia , just behind him , leading Eddie by the hand . Eddie 's young blue eyes were wide with a child 's curiosity , but even now the four-and-a-half-year-old was learning that Moscow was n't Disney World . The culture shock was about to fall like Thor 's own hammer , but it would expand his horizons a bit , his parents thought . As it would theirs . " Uh-huh , " Ed Foley said on his first look . An embassy consular officer had lived here before , and he 'd at least made an effort to clean the place up , no doubt helped by a Russian domestic-the Soviet government provided them , and diligent they were . . . for both their bosses . Ed and Mary Pat had been thoroughly briefed for weeks-nay , months-before taking the long Pan Am flight out of JFK for Moscow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed observed in a studiously neutral voice . " Welcome to Moscow , " Mike Barnes told the newbies . He was another consular officer , a career FSO on the way up , and had this week 's duty as the embassy greeter . " The last occupant was Charlie Wooster . Good guy , back at Foggy Bottom now , catching the summer heat . " " How are the summers here ? " Mary Pat asked . " Kinda like Minneapolis , " Barnes answered . " Not real hot , and the humidity 's not too bad , and the winters are actually not as severe-I grew up in Minneapolis , " he explained . " Of course , the German army might not agree , or Napoleon , but , well , nobody ever said Moscow was supposed to be like Paris , right ? " " Yeah , they told me about the nightlife , " Ed chuckled . It was all right with him . They did n't need a stealthy Station Chief in Paris , and this was the biggest , ripest plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , but not the very belly of the beast . Bob Ritter must have been really impressed by his time in Tehran . Thank God Mary Pat had delivered Eddie when she had . They 'd missed the takeover in Iran by , what , three weeks ? It had been a troublesome pregnancy , and Mary Pat 's doc had insisted on their coming back to New York for the delivery . Kids were a gift from God , all right . . . . Besides , that had made Eddie a New Yorker , too , and Ed had damned well wanted his son to be a Yankees and Rangers fan from birth . The best news of this assignment , aside from the professional stuff , was that he 'd see the best ice hockey in the world right here in Moscow . Screw the ballet and the symphony . These fuckers knew how to skate . Pity the Russkies did n't understand baseball . Probably too sophisticated for the muzhiks . All those pitches to choose from . . . " It 's not real big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . They were on the sixth floor . At least the traffic noise would n't be too bad . The foreigners ' compound-ghetto-was walled and guarded . This was for their protection , the Russians insisted , but street crime against foreigners was n't a problem in Moscow . The average Russian citizen was forbidden by law to have foreign currency in his possession , and there was no convenient way to spend it in any case . So there was little profit in mugging an American or Frenchman on the streets , and there was no mistaking them-their clothing marked them about as clearly as peacocks among crows . " Hello ! " It was an English accent . The florid face appeared a moment later . " We 're your neighbors . Nigel and Penny Haydock , " the face 's owner said . He was about forty-five , tall and skinny , with prematurely gray and thinning hair . His wife , younger and prettier than he probably deserved , appeared an instant later with a tray of sandwiches and some welcoming white wine . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's when Ed Foley noticed the maternity dress . She was about six months gone , by the look of her . So the briefings had been right in every detail . Foley trusted CIA , but he 'd learned the hard way to verify everything , from the names of people living on the same floor to whether the toilet flushed reliably . Especially in Moscow , he thought , heading for the bathroom . Nigel followed . " The plumbing works reliably here , but it is noisy . No one complains , " Haydock explained . Ed Foley flipped the handle and , sure enough , it was noisy . " Fixed that myself . Bit of a handyman , you see , " he said . Then , more quietly , " Be careful where you speak in this place , Ed . Bloody bugs everywhere . Especially the bedrooms . The bloody Russians like to count our orgasms , so it seems . Penny and I try not to disappoint . " A sly grin . Well , to some cities you brought your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet seemed to run forever . Foley was tempted to lift the tank cover to see if Haydock had replaced the plumbing hardware inside with something special . He decided he did n't have to look to check that . " Twenty-nine months . Seven to go . It 's a lively place to work . I 'm sure they told you , everywhere you go , you 'll have a ' friend ' handy . Do n't underestimate them , either . The Second Directorate chaps are thoroughly trained . . . . " The toilet ran its course , and Haydock changed his voice . " The shower-the hot water is pretty reliable , but the spray pipe , it rattles , just like the one in our flat . . . . " He turned the faucet to demonstrate . Sure enough , it rattled . Had someone worked on the wall to loosen it ? Ed wondered . Probably . Probably this very handyman with him . " Perfect . " " Yes , you will get a lot of work done in here . Shower with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California ? " Foley managed his first laugh in Moscow . " Yeah , that 's what they say , all right . " He gave his visitor a look . He was surprised that Haydock had introduced himself so early , but maybe it was just reverse-English tradecraft to be so obvious . The business of espionage had all manner of rules , and the Russians were rule-followers . So , Bob Ritter had told him , toss away part of the rulebook . Stick to your cover and be a dumbass unpredictable American every chance you get . He 'd also told the Foleys that Nigel Haydock was one guy they could trust . He was the son of another intelligence officer-a man betrayed by Kim Philby himself , one of the poor bastards who 'd parachuted into Albania into the waiting arms of the KGB reception committee . Nigel had been five years old then , just old enough always to remember what it was like to lose your father to the enemy . Nigel 's motivation was probably as good as Mary Pat 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , Ed Foley might admit after a few drinks . Mary Pat hated the bastards as the Lord God Himself hated sin . Haydock was n't the Station Chief here , but he was the head birddog for the SIS 's operation in Moscow , and that made him pretty good . The CIA 's Director , Judge Moore , trusted the Brits : after Philby , he 'd seen them go through SIS with a flamethrower hotter than even James Jesus Angleton 's fly rod and cauterize every possible leak . In turn , Foley trusted Judge Moore , and so did the President . That was the craziest part of the intelligence business : You could n't trust anybody-but you had to trust somebody . Well , Foley thought , checking the hot water with his hand , nobody ever said the business made much sense . Like classical metaphysics . It just was . " When 's the furniture get here ? " " The container ought to be on a truck in Leningrad right now . Will they tamper with it ? " Haydock shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can never know how thorough they are , Edward . The KGB is a great bloody bureaucracy-you do n't know the meaning of the word until you see it in operation here . For example , the bugs in your flat-how many of them actually work ? They 're not British Telecom , nor are they AT &T.; It 's the curse of this country , really , and it works for us , but that , too , is unreliable . When you 're followed , you ca n't know if it 's an experienced expert or some bloody nimrod who ca n't find his way to the loo . They look alike and dress alike . Just like our people , when you get down to it , but their bureaucracy is so large that there 's a greater likelihood it will protect the incompetent-or maybe not . God knows , at Century House we have our share of drones . " Foley nodded . " At Langley , we call it the Intelligence Directorate . " " Quite . We call ours the Palace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice . " I think we 've tested the plumbing enough . " Foley turned off the faucet and the two men returned to the living room , where Penny and Mary Pat were getting acquainted . " Well , we have enough hot water anyway , honey . " " Glad to hear it , " Mary Pat responded . She turned back to her guest . " Where do you shop around here ? " Penny Haydock smiled : " I can take you there . For special items , we can order from an agency in Helsinki , excellent quality : English , French , German-even American , for things like juices and preserved foods . The perishables are Finnish in origin , and they 're generally very good , especially the lamb . Do n't they have the finest lamb , Nigel ? " " Indeed it is-as good as New Zealand , " her husband agreed . " The steaks leave something to be desired , " Mike Barnes told them , " but every week we get steaks flown in from Omaha . Tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the truth , " Nigel confirmed . " Your corn-fed beef is superb . I 'm afraid we 're all quite addicted to it . " " Thank God for the U.S. Air Force , " Barnes went on . " They fly the beef into all their NATO bases , and we 're on the distribution list . They come in frozen , not quite as good as fresh at Delmonico 's , but close enough to remind you of home . I hope you guys brought a grill . We tend to take them up on the roof to cook out . We import charcoal , too . Ivan just does n't seem to understand about that . " The apartment had no balcony , perhaps to protect them from the diesel smell that pervaded the city . " What about going to work ? " Foley asked . " Better to take the metro . It really is great , " Barnes told him . " Leaving me with the car ? " Mary Pat asked , with a hopeful smile . This was going exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went well in this business came as something of a surprise , like the right presents under the Christmas tree . You always hoped Santa got the letter , but you could never be sure . " You might as well learn how to drive in this city , " Barnes said . " At least you have a nice car . " The previous resident in this apartment had left behind a white Mercedes 280 for them , which was indeed a nice car . Actually , a little too nice at only four years old . Not that there were all that many cars in Moscow , and the license plates surely marked it as belonging to an American diplomat , and thus easy to spot by any traffic cop , and by the KGB vehicle that would follow it most places it went . Again , it was reverse-English . Mary Pat would have to learn to drive like an Indianapolis resident on her first trip to New York . " The streets are nice and wide , " Barnes told her , " and the gas station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a huge one . The Russians like to build them that way . " " Great , " she observed for Barnes 's benefit , already dropping into her cover as a pretty , ditsy blonde . Around the world , the pretty ones were supposed to be the dumb ones , and blondes most of all . It was a hell of a lot easier to play dumb than to be smart , after all , Hollywood actors notwithstanding . " What about servicing the car ? " Ed asked . " It 's a Mercedes . They do n't break much , " Barnes assured them . " The German embassy has a guy who can fix anything that goes bad . We 're cordial with our NATO allies . You guys soccer fans ? " " Girls ' game , " Ed Foley responded immediately . " That 's rather coarse of you , " Nigel Haydock observed . " Give me American football any time , " Foley countered . " Bloody foolish , uncivilized game , full of violence and committee meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's eat . " They sat down . The interim furniture was adequate , something like you 'd find in a no-tell motel in Alabama . You could sleep on the bed , and the bug spray had probably done for all the crawly things . Probably . The sandwiches were okay . Mary Pat went to get glasses and turned on the taps- " Recommend against that one , Mrs. Foley , " Nigel warned . " Some people come down with stomach complaints from the tap water . . . . " " Oh ? " She paused . " And my name 's Mary Pat , Nigel . " Now they were properly introduced . " Yes , Mary Pat . We prefer bottled water for drinking . The tap water is good enough for bathing , and you can boil it in a pinch for coffee and tea . " " It 's even worse in Leningrad , " Nigel warned . " The natives are more or less immunized , they tell me , but we foreigners can get some serious GI problems there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been worried about that . " The American-British school looks after the children well , " Penny Haydock promised . " I work there myself part-time . And the academic program there is top-drawer . " " Eddie 's starting to read already , is n't he , honey ? " the proud father announced . " Just Peter Rabbit and that sort of thing , but not bad for four , " an equally pleased mother confirmed for the rest . For his part , Eddie had found the sandwich plate and was gnawing through something . It was n't his treasured bologna , but a hungry kid is not always discriminating . There were also four large jars of Skippy 's Super Chunk peanut butter packed away in a safe place . His parents figured they could get grape jelly anywhere , but probably not Skippy . The local bread , everyone said , was decent , if not exactly the Wonder Bread that American children had been raised on .

NOT ALL THAT far away from where they sat , a letter changed hands . The deliverer was from Warsaw , and had been dispatched by his government-actually , by an agency of his government to an agency of the recipient government . The messenger was not all that pleased by his mission . He was a communist-he had to be in order to be entrusted with such a task-but he was nonetheless a Pole , as was the subject of the message and the mission . And that was the rub . The message was in fact a photocopy of the original , which had arrived by hand to an office-an important one-in Warsaw only three days before . The messenger , a full colonel in his country 's intelligence service , was personally known to the recipient , by sight if not especially by affection . The Russians used their western neighbors for many tasks . The Poles had a real talent for intelligence operations , for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To their west was Germany , and to their east was the Soviet Union . The unhappy circumstances involved in both had resulted in Poland 's putting many of its best and brightest into the intelligence business . The recipient knew all that . In fact , he already knew word for word the content of the message . He 'd learned it the previous day . He was not surprised at the delay , though . The Polish government had taken that day to consider the contents and its import before forwarding it , and the recipient took no umbrage . Every government in the world took at least one day to go over such things . It was just the nature of men in positions of authority to diddle and waver , even though they had to know that delay was a waste of time and air . Even Marxism-Leninism could n't alter human nature . Sad , but true . The New Soviet Man , like the New Polish Man , was , in the end , still a man . The ballet being played out now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Leningrad . The recipient even imagined he could hear the music playing . He actually preferred Western jazz to classical , but in any case the music at the ballet was just the garnish , the system that told the dancers when to leap together like pretty , trained dogs . The ballerinas were far too slender for Russian tastes , of course , but real women were far too heavy for those little fairies they called men to toss about . Why was his mind wandering ? He resumed his seat , falling back slowly into his leather chair as he unfolded the letter . It was written in Polish , and he did n't speak or read Polish , but affixed to it was a translation in literate Russian . Of course , he 'd have his own translators go over it , plus two or three psychiatrists to consider the mental state of the drafter and to compose their own multipage analysis , which he 'd have to read , time waster though that would be . Then he 'd have to report on it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these additional insights so that they could waste their time going over the message and its import before considering what to do about it . The Chairman wondered if this Polish colonel realized how easy his own political bosses had had it . In the end , all they 'd had to do was forward it to their own political masters for action , bucking the decision up the tree of responsibility as government functionaries all do , regardless of place or philosophy . Vassals were vassals the world over . The Chairman looked up at him . " Comrade Colonel , thank you for bringing this to my attention . Please extend my greetings and my respects to your commander . Dismissed . " The Pole snapped to attention , saluted in the curious Polish way , did his best parade-ground about face , then headed off to the door . Yuriy Andropov watched the door close before turning his attention back to the message and its appended translation . " So , Karol , you threaten us , eh ? " He clucked his tongue and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are brave , but your judgment needs adjustment , my cleric comrade . " He looked up again , pondering . The office had the usual artwork covering the walls , and for the same reason as in any other office-to avoid blankness . Two were oil paintings by Renaissance masters , borrowed from the collection of some long-dead czar or nobleman . A third portrait , rather a good one , actually , was of Lenin , the pale complexion and domed forehead known to millions all around the world . A nicely framed color photograph of Leonid Brezhnev , the current General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , hung near it . The photo was a lie , a picture of a young and vigorous man , not the senile old goat who now sat at the head of the Politburo table . Well , all men grew old , but in most places , such men left their jobs for honorable retirement . But not in his country , Andropov realized . . . and looked down at the letter . And not this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life . But he is threatening to change that part of the equation , the Chairman of the Committee for State Security thought . And in that was the danger . Danger ? The consequences were unknown , and that was danger enough . His Politburo colleagues would see it the same way , old , cautious , and frightened men that they were . And so he had not merely to report the danger . He must also present a means of dealing with it effectively . The portraits that ought to have been on his wall right now were of two men who were semiforgotten . One would have been Iron Feliks-Dzerzhinskiy himself , the founder of the Cheka , the antecedent of the KGB . The other ought to have been Josef Vissarionovich Stalin . The leader had once posed a question that was relevant to the very situation that faced Andropov now . Then , it had been 1944 . Now-now maybe it was even more relevant . Well , that remained to be seen . And he 'd be the man to make that determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disappear . The thought should have surprised him when it leapt into his head , but it did n't . This building , built eighty years earlier to be the palatial home office of the Rossiya Insurance Company , had seen a lot of that , and its inhabitants had issued orders to cause many , many more deaths . They used to have executions in the basement . That had ended only a few years before , as KGB expanded to include all the space in even this massive structure-and another on the inner ring road around the city-but the cleanup crew occasionally whispered about the ghosts to be seen on quiet nights , sometimes startling the old washerwomen with their buckets and brushes and witch-like hair . The government of this country did n't believe in such things as spirits and ghosts any more than it believed in a man 's immortal soul , but doing away with the superstitions of the simple peasants was a more difficult task than getting the intelligentsia to buy into the voluminous writings of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin , Karl Marx , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stalin ( but actually done by a committee formed of frightened men , and all the worse because of it ) , which was , blessedly , no longer much in demand except to the most masochistic of scholars . No , Yuriy Vladimirovich told himself , getting people to believe in Marxism was n't all that hard . First , they hammered it into their heads in grammar schools , and the Young Pioneers , and high schools , and the Komsomolets , the Young Communist League , and then the really smart ones became full Party members , keeping their Party cards " next to their hearts , " in the cigarette pockets of their shirts . But by then , they knew better . The politically aware members professed their belief at Party meetings because they had to do that to get ahead . In the same way , the smart courtiers in pharaonic Egypt kneeled and shielded their eyes from the bright-light-emanating face , lest they be blinded-they held up their hands because , in Pharaoh , in the person of their Living God , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeisance and denied their senses and their sensibility and got ahead . So it was here . Five thousand years , was it ? He could check a history book . The Soviet Union turned out some of the world 's foremost medieval historians , and doubtless some competent antiquarians as well , because that was one area of scholarship where politics did n't matter much . The facts of ancient Egypt were too distant from contemporary reality to matter to the philosophical speculation of Marx or the endless ramblings of Lenin . And so some fine scholars went into that field . More went into the pure sciences , because pure science was pure science and a hydrogen atom had no politics . But agriculture did . Manufacturing did . And so the best and brightest stayed away from those areas , opting instead for political studies . Because there success was to be found . You did n't have to believe it any more than you believed that Ramses II was the living son of the sun god , or whatever the hell god he was supposed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtiers saw that Ramses had numerous wives and even more numerous progeny , and that , on the whole , was n't a bad life for a man to have . The classical equivalent of a dacha in the Lenin Hills and summers on the beach at Sochi . So , did the world ever really change ? Probably not , the Chairman of the Committee for State Security decided . And his job was largely to protect against change . And this letter threatened change , did n't it ? It was a threat , and he might have to do something about the threat . That meant doing something about the man behind it . It had happened before . It could happen again , he decided . Andropov would not live long enough to learn that in considering this action , he would set in motion the demise of his own country .
