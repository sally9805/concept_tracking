Section : Hands On strategies Strategic planning is time-consuming and labor-intensive , right ? Not necessarily . One consultant says he can craft a bold new action plan in just 48 hours strategies <p> STRATEGIC PLANNING IS one of the big guilt trips of business . Everyone knows you should do it , but the process is intimidating , expensive , and time-consuming . Anyone who 's worked in corporate America knows that it can stretch for months , even years . That makes it easy to procrastinate . And even when you do get around to it , the bold strategic vision of five years from now tends to get lost in the day-to-day scramble of right now . It 's hard not to wonder : Does strategic planning even have a place in a fast-moving company ? <p> It does if you can keep it simple and fast . So says consultant Keith McFarland , who is one of a number of business thinkers trying to figure out how to transform the strategic planning process into something entrepreneurs can embrace . McFarland , a former Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Utah , calls his approach rapid enterprise development , or RED . It 's modeled on a popular computer programming technique called rapid application development , or RAD , which relies on prototyping and iterative improvements to complete a project . Just like building a piece of software , developing a business strategy that solves 100% of a problem can take months , says McFarland  --  and by the time you can deliver a solution , the problem may have changed . With RED , the idea is to produce an 80% solution with the built-in flexibility to adjust it over time . The best part of McFarland 's approach ? It can be done in just 48 hours . <p> That approach appealed to Bob Hogan . Back in 2002 , he had just engineered a management buyout of his company , AmerCable , from its publicly traded parent , Associated Materials . AmerCable , which is based in El Dorado , Ark. , and manufactures industrial-grade power cables for coal mines and deep-sea oil rigs , was in a mature industry and Hogan wanted to find a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its corporate restraints  --  and lifelines  --  AmerCable needed a new strategy . Not only did Hogan feel pressure to impress his new private equity investors , he had a considerable personal financial stake in the outcome as well . But how could he justify spending the weeks or even months it would take to craft that plan ? <p> That 's when Hogan remembered McFarland , whom he had met at a recent conference for entrepreneurs . He got in touch , and McFarland promised Hogan that he could help him craft a strategic plan in all of three days . A retreat was scheduled at a Texas ranch south of Dallas . Hogan had been involved in strategic planning in the past but had found the process dull , time-consuming , and ultimately not very useful . He was excited to see what McFarland 's untraditional approach could accomplish . <p> Rapid enterprise development encourages both conflict and consensus . " Both stimulate creative thinking , " says Mc-Farland , who has led some 80 clients through the process over the past five years . He declined to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the price tag can easily reach $40,000 . Companies are divided into teams , each of which is charged with identifying , for example , the business 's four biggest challenges over the coming year and the five things customers like best about the company . Resource allocation is also a key topic : The group is encouraged to identify the company 's top potential profit centers , or where it can get the most bang for its buck . Using such insights as a guide , the group then reaches a consensus on where the company wants to be in five years . The next step , and the heart of the process , is plotting a series of less ambitious , 90-day goals designed to get it there . <p> The process flies in the face of traditional strategic planning , which emphasizes painstaking research and considerable caution . After all , anyone can come up with a plan in 48 hours , but can you really be sure it 's the right plan ? Michael Porter , the strategy guru from Harvard , is n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve customers , partners , and suppliers , he 's skeptical that the strategy would go beyond " glorifying existing biases . " <p> Most leaders know where they want to be in five years , adds David Norton , co-creator of the " balanced scorecard , " a strategy-generating tool popular with larger organizations that helps companies measure their performance . The problem is figuring out how to get there  --  and 48 hours simply is not enough time to solve it , he says . That 's why most strategic planning exercises last at least three months . " You need time for people to debate , digest , and to distribute to the rest of the organization , " Norton says . <p> To a time-strapped entrepreneur , of course , three months can feel like a lifetime . " Nobody has the patience to follow up on old-fashioned strategic planning anymore , " says Dan Bianci , president of Foamade , which manufactures foam components for automobiles in Auburn Hills , Mich . Within weeks of working with McFarland last year , his team had already begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying new lower-cost materials . Part of the beauty of the RED system , Bianci says , is that it encourages managers to take immediate action with the expectation that the plan will be modified over time . It 's also more democratic than many traditional approaches ; it involves rank-and-file employees , investors , and other stakeholders  --  not just top managers . Hogan brought about 25 AmerCable employees to his session  --  more than 10% of his work force  --  as well as a handful of his investors , all of whom worked together to generate goals that employees could commit to because they had created them for themselves . <p> No one , least of all McFarland , denies that condensing three months of planning into 48 hours is hard work . That 's why he injects humor , and a stopwatch , into RED 's 15 or so goal-setting exercises . Every exercise is timed and everyone is expected to contribute by stepping up to a whiteboard to list competitors or chart a division 's five-year revenue potential . No one is allowed to leave the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disagree . " Nobody has time to get bored or to doodle , " says Bianci . " You 're immediately engaged . " <p> For AmerCable , defining a five-year goal was simple : to become the on-time delivery leader in the power-cable industry and push annual revenue to $100 million . Hogan and his team then hunkered down to slice that vision into a series of 90-day action plans  --  such as ramping up sales to the robotics segment of the automotive industry and expanding into burgeoning markets such as China . Then came the task of assigning people to act on those goals , committing the company 's director of business development , for example , to drum up at least one new international business partner within 90 days . " We came out of there energized and with a sense of purpose , " Hogan says . <p> Now , three years after the initial session , AmerCable has met most of its goals . The company is thriving and , thanks to new sales in China , earned about $80 million last year , 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year target . The company has done so well that its investors were able to cash out their investment . McFarland continues to meet with Hogan and his team every six months to check in and set new 90-day goals , which he helps AmerCable manage online . Hogan credits the RED process for much of AmerCable 's success . " Strategy is n't a cure-all by itself , " he says . " At some point , you have to stop talking about the things you should be doing and start doing them . " The Need for Speed <p> Keith McFarland says he can draft a new strategic plan in just 48 hours . Here 's how : 1 Assign Homework <p> Ask participants to outline key opportunities and challenges before the strategy sessions begin . 2 Stay Focused <p> Ban cell phones and BlackBerrys and keep breaks to a minimum . 3 Watch the Clock <p> Set time limits for goal-setting exercises  --  but refuse to adjourn meetings until a consensus is reached . 4 Lighten Up <p> McFarland conducts sessions barefoot , and livens proceedings by showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first 48 hours are only the beginning . Strategic goals should be revisited every 90 days . <p> Which Way ? AmerCable 's Bob Hogan needed a new plan  --  and he needed it fast . <p> By Darren Dahl <p>
