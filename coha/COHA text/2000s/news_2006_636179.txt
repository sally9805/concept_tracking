<p> Once we 've recorded their initial utterances , forced smiles , sneezes , burps and any other exchanges , Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson will be followed today by a quivering scrum of humanity . Some of these folks actually might be able to see , too . I only hope the police are ready , photographers behave during Woods ' backswing and sufficient numbers of oxygen tanks and defillibrators are nearby . <p> Because no matter whose camp you 're in  --  and as much as Woods has dominated in Chicago , Phil does have a rabid army here  --  their pairing in the PGA Championship is an event to behold . So they are n't chummy and might qualify as sport 's version of Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan . So Mickelson 's coach dissed Tiger and made the dumbest bulletin-board remarks in these parts since Gerald Wilkins was called " the Jordan stopper . " So wise golf people expect Woods , locked again in his hermetically sealed bubble , to file away the comments , resume his recent unconscious play , whip Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go on to win his 12th major title . <p> For now , we 're just interested in the group snapshot at 8:30 a.m . <p> CONTRASTING PERSONALITIES <p> What happens is n't as important as the fact they 're here , at stately Medinah , paired together in a duel of golfing gifts and polar-opposite personalities . Any time the two greatest players in any endeavor align in your town , you appreciate the moment and realize it probably never will pass this way again , even if Mickelson greets you on the first tee with a smile and Woods has that intense pout thing going . Wait , I hear a party-pooper in the crowd saying , " I would think that 8:30 is pretty early on a Thursday , and to be on the 10th tee way out in the middle of nowhere , I do n't think there 's going to be many people out there . " <p> Oh , that 's just Mickelson , cracking wise about a spectacle that spills into the second round Friday afternoon and , hopefully , into only their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular place at the club , obviously , will be wherever Tiger and Phil set foot . That will leave the rest of Medinah No. 3 in relative peace , including a tree on the 16th hole that usually gathers the most attention . It was there , seven Augusts ago , that a Spanish teenager invaded the hearts of a final-round gallery that smacked of a beer-guzzling , woof-woofing Bears crowd . He accomplished this by doing something crazy : standing behind that tree , closing his eyes , fearlessly whacking the ball , jumping away so it would n't hit him and then , in a flash of joy that cured comas and made Planet Earth grin , sprinting down the fairway in a kid-like romp and hopping through the air to see where the ball had landed . <p> Maybe it is n't Wrigley Field or the Jordan statue . But Sergio Garcia made that tree and plot of land a special place for the country-clubbers and their visitors . If he could pull off an amazing shot , could n't they at least try ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the nose , did n't they still race out and hop and skip as he did ? When he arrived this week and visited the spot , Garcia did n't find a plaque . But he was saddened to hear that the tree is n't as healthy as before and that the area has changed significantly . <p> " They were telling me the tree was kind of struggling a little bit and they 've had to overseed the little spot because everybody 's been hitting from it , " he said Wednesday . " It definitely looks a little different than seven years ago from everybody hitting . It looked like the sod , the grass they put in it , it 's more at an angle now , so the ball , even if it goes like it went in ' 99 , it will come back a little bit more . So a shot wo n't be as much into the tree as it was in ' 99 . " <p> UNREALIZED POTENTIAL <p> Is he tempted to relive the moment , put on a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes on the Golf Channel ? " Unfortunately , you know , I 'm a lot older , " Garcia said . " So I do n't have the energy I used to have . " <p> Consider it symbolism . As the tree has eroded , so have hopes that Garcia would forge a long , fun rivalry with Woods . For about 15 minutes  --  literally  --  he was bigger than young Tiger . He had chopped four strokes off Woods ' five-stroke lead and was poised to shock the world . Tiger had gone more than two years without a major championship since his historic breakthrough at Augusta National . He was having his first confidence crisis after firing his caddie , losing his No. 1 ranking and struggling with his swing . If Garcia had finished him off , who knows how golf 's world order would have played out ? <p> But on No. 17 , Woods made what you still might call the biggest putt of his life . His new caddie , Steve Williams , helped him with a suggestion that worked . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major No. 2 , which launched the most incredible stretch of golf ever played , including a stupefying seven titles in an 11-major stretch and stirring routs at Pebble Beach and St.Andrews . I would love to tell you Garcia won two or three majors along the way and has joined Mickelson and Woods in golf 's glam threesome . But I 'm afraid his career has been stuck in idle since that day . <p> Paralyzed in midair , you might say . <p> He gags in majors . He treats the final round of a tournament like he 's seeing snakes on planes . He struggles painfully on the greens . He used to be ripped famously for his maddening waggles , involving hip movements and an almost comical gripping and regripping of his club . At 26 , he looks back and sees a career that peaked at Medinah and has plunged as steadily as Tiger 's has soared . It was sadly predictable last month when Garcia , who started Sunday at the British Open one shot out of the lead , quickly putted himself out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jug . <p> A fair question : What happened , Sergio ? Why has n't the joy translated into success ? And was n't challenging Woods at such a young age more a curse than a blessing ? <p> PALES IN COMPARISON <p> " The biggest problem is when somebody comes and sits here , you 're only thinking about one guy who has done something unbelievable , very difficult to repeat , " he said of Woods . " And you expect everybody else to do the same . It 's not easy to go out and win a major when you 're young . Tiger has been able to do that plenty of times , and you expect everyone else to do it . The only thing I can do is at least give myself a chance . <p> " If I think about it , of course , I think I could have done better . But I do n't think many guys under 30 have a much better career than I do . So it ca n't be too bad . You 're 26 , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the top 10 in the world five years at least . So it 's got to be a good career . " <p> In another era , maybe . But in the era of Woods , seven years after challenging him like few have , it is a disappointing career . And his words sound like those of a beaten man . Count Garcia among the many who have been psychologically disheveled by the Woods mystique and killer instinct . <p> In the Tiger epic , there can be only one supporting actor . <p> Jay Mariotti is a regular on " Around the Horn " at 4 p.m. on ESPN .
