Chapter One Bud Mitchell drove his Ford Explorer along Dune Road . Up ahead was a sign that said CUPSOGUE BEACH COUNTY PARK-OPEN DAWN TO DUSK . It was dusk , but Bud drove through an empty parking field , on the far side of which was a wide nature trail , partially blocked by a roll-up fence . A sign said NO VEHICLES . He said to the woman sitting in his passenger seat , " Are you sure you want to do this ? " Jill Winslow replied , " Yes . It 's exciting . " Bud nodded without enthusiasm . He skirted around the fence and continued on in four-wheel drive along the sandy trail flanked by high , grass-covered dunes . Having extramarital sex should have been exciting enough for both of them , he thought , but Jill did n't see it that way . For her , cheating on her husband was only worth it if the sex , romance , and excitement were better than at home . For him , the taboo of having sex with another man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bud Mitchell had come to the startling conclusion that women were different . Now , five years later and two years into this affair , he realized that Jill 's fantasies and his were n't communicating very well . Still , Jill Winslow was beautiful , willing , and most important , she was someone else 's wife , and she wanted to keep it that way . For him , safe sex meant having it with a married woman . An added kick for Bud was that he and his wife , Arlene , traveled in the same social circles as Jill and her husband , Mark . When the four of them were together at a social function , Bud felt the opposite of awkward or guilty ; he felt terrific , his ego knew no bounds , and he reveled in his secret knowledge that he had seen every inch of the beautiful Jill Winslow 's naked body . But , it was n't that secret , of course , or it would n't have been so much fun . Early in the affair , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other that they would n't tell anyone . Since then , they 'd both hinted that they 'd had to confide in close friends solely for the purpose of providing cover stories for their absences from home and hearth . Bud always wondered who of her friends knew , and at social gatherings he had fun trying to guess . They had driven in separate cars from their homes on Long Island 's Gold Coast , about fifty-five miles from Westhampton , and Jill had parked in a village lot where they 'd rendezvoused , then driven to a hotel together in Bud 's Explorer . At the hotel , Bud had asked her what her cover story was and gotten a one-word answer , so he asked again , " Where are you tonight ? " " Dinner with a girlfriend who has a place in East Hampton . Shopping tomorrow . " She added , " That part is true , since you have to get home in the morning . " " The friend is cool with this ? " She let out an exasperated breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay . " Bud noticed that she never asked about his cover story , as if the less she knew , the better . He volunteered , " I 'm deep-sea fishing with friends . Bad cell phone reception on the ocean . " Jill shrugged . Bud Mitchell understood that in their own way , both he and Jill loved their slightly boring spouses , they loved their children , and their comfortable upper-middle-class lives . They also loved each other , or said they did , but not enough to chuck everything to be together seven days a week . Three or four times a month seemed to be good enough . The trail ended at a sand dune , and Bud stopped . Jill said , " Go toward the beach . " Bud turned off the sandy trail toward the ocean . The Explorer descended a gradual slope through brush and sea grass as he steered around a high dune . He stopped on the far side of the dune where the vehicle could n't be seen from the trail . His dashboard clock read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he noticed that the ocean itself was smooth as a pond . The sky was clear except for some scattered clouds . He said to Jill , " Nice night . " She opened her door and got out . Bud turned off the engine and followed her . They surveyed the expanse of white sand beach that ended at the ocean 's edge fifty yards away . The water sparkled with golden flecks in the setting sun and a soft land breeze rustled the sea oats on the dunes . Bud looked around to see if they were alone . Dune Road was the only way in or out of this barrier island , and he 'd seen a few cars leaving the beaches and heading back toward Westhampton , but no cars traveling in their direction . The thin island ended a hundred yards to the west at Moriches Inlet , and on the other side of the inlet he could see the edge of Smith Point County Park on Fire Island . It was Wednesday , so the Hampton weekenders were back in the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus , it was about a half mile back to where vehicles were supposed to stop . Bud said , " I guess we have the beach to ourselves . " " That 's what I told you . " Jill went around the Explorer and opened the rear hatch . Bud joined her and together they removed a few items , including a blanket , an ice chest , a video camera , and a tripod . They found a sheltered valley between two grassy dunes , and Jill laid out the blanket and cooler while Bud set up the tripod and video camera . He took off the lens cap , looked through the viewfinder , and pointed the camera at Jill sitting cross-legged and barefoot on the blanket . The last glimmers of red sunlight illuminated the scene , and Bud adjusted the zoom lens and hit the Record button . He joined Jill on the blanket as she uncorked a bottle of white wine . He took two wineglasses from the ice chest and she poured . They clinked glasses , and Bud said , " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank and kissed . They were both aware of the video camera recording their images and voices , and they were a little self-conscious . Jill broke the ice by saying , " So , do you come here often ? " Bud smiled and replied , " First time . How about you ? " They smiled at each other and the silence became almost awkward . Bud did n't like the camera pointing at them , but he could see the upside later when they got back to their hotel room in Westhampton and played the tape while they had sex in bed . Maybe this was n't such a bad idea . They had a second glass of wine , and aware that the light was fading , Jill got down to business . She set her glass on the cooler , stood , and pulled off her knit top . Bud stood and took off his shirt . Jill dropped her khaki shorts and kicked them away . She stood there a few seconds in her bra and panties as Bud got undressed , then she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced the camera , threw her arms in the air , did a few gyrations , then said , " Ta da ! " and bowed toward the camera . They embraced and kissed , and their hands ran over each other 's bare body . Jill moved Bud at right angles to the lens , then looked back at the camera and said , " Blow job . Take One . " She dropped to her knees and began to perform oral sex on him . Bud got very stiff while his knees went rubbery . He did n't know what to do with his hands , so he put them on her head and ran his fingers through her straight brown hair . Bud forced a smile , knowing the camera was capturing the expression on his face , and he wanted to look happy when they played it back later . But , in truth , he felt somewhere between silly and uncomfortable . He could be a little raunchy in mixed company , while she was usually soft-spoken and demure , with an occasional smile or witticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her sexual nuttiness . She sensed he was about to come , and she rocked back on her haunches and said , " That 's a wrap . Scene Two . Wine , please . " Bud retrieved the bottle of wine . She lay on her back and thrust her legs into the air and said , " A wife-tasting party . " She spread her legs and said , " Pour . " Bud knelt between her legs and poured the wine , then without further stage direction , he buried his tongue in her . Jill was breathing hard now , but managed to say , " I hope you have that camera pointed right . " Bud came up for air and glanced at the camera . " Yeah . " She took the bottle and poured the remainder of the wine over her body . " Lick . " He licked the wine from her hard belly and breasts and ran his tongue over her nipples . After a few minutes , she sat up and said , " I 'm sticky . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we should go . We 'll shower at the hotel . " She ignored him and climbed to the top of the sheltering dune and looked out at the ocean . " Come on . Set the camera up here and get us skinny-dipping . " Bud knew better than to argue , so he walked quickly to the video camera , stopped it , then carried it with the tripod to the top of the dune and set the legs into the sand . Bud looked out over the sand , ocean , and sky . The horizon was still lit by the dying rays of the sun , but the sea and the water were dark blue and purple now . Overhead he could see stars appearing and noticed the blinking lights of high-flying aircraft and the glow of a big ship on the distant horizon . The breeze had picked up , and it cooled his sweaty , naked body . Jill looked through the viewfinder and switched to a twilight setting , then set the autofocus on infinity and zoomed out for a wide shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is so beautiful . " Bud replied , " Maybe we should n't go down to the beach naked . There could be people around . " " So what ? As long as we do n't know them , who cares ? " " Yeah , but let 's take some clothes- " " Live dangerously , Bud . " She stepped off the dune , sliding and hopping all the way down the slope to the beach . Bud watched her , marveling at her perfect naked body as she ran to the water . She turned toward him and shouted , " Come on ! " He ran down the slope , across the flat beach . He felt silly running naked with his thing flapping in the breeze . He caught up to her as she reached the water , and she turned him to the camera on the dune . She waved and shouted , " Bud and Jill swim with the sharks . " She took his hand , and they splashed into the calm ocean . The initial shock of the cool water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped when the salty seawater reached their hips , and they washed each other front and back . Jill looked out at the sea . " This is magic . " Bud stood beside her and together they stared , mesmerized by the glassy sea and the purple sky spread out before them . To their right , Bud noticed the blinking lights of an aircraft , about eight or ten miles off Fire Island at an altitude of maybe ten or fifteen thousand feet . Bud watched the aircraft as it drew closer , the last rays of the setting sun reflecting off its wings . It left four white contrails in the deep blue sky , and Bud guessed it had taken off from Kennedy Airport about sixty miles to the west , and it was heading toward Europe . The moment called for romance , so he said , " I 'd like to be on that plane with you , going to Paris or Rome . " She laughed . " You panic when you 're gone for an hour in a hot-sheet motel . How are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was annoyed and said , " I do n't panic . I 'm cautious . For your sake . " He said , " Let 's go . " " In a minute . " She squeezed his butt and said , " This videotape is going to burn up the TV screen . " He was still annoyed and did n't respond . She took hold of his penis and said , " Let 's do it here . " " Uh ... " He looked up and down the beach , then at the camera on the sand dune , pointing at them . " Come on . Before someone comes . Just like that scene in From Here to Eternity . " He had a million good reasons why they should n't have sex on the open beach , but Jill had a firm grip on the one good reason why they should . She took his hand and led him to the shore where the gentle surf was lapping over the wet sand . She said , " Lie down . " Bud lay on the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lay on top of him , and they made love slowly and rhythmically , the way she liked it , her doing most of the work at her own pace . Bud was a little distracted by the surf rolling over his face and body , and he was a bit anxious by being so exposed on the beach . But within a minute , the size of his world shrunk to the area between their legs , and he would n't have noticed a tsunami breaking over him . A minute later , she climaxed and he ejaculated into her . She lay on him , breathing heavily for a few seconds , then she straddled him with her knees and sat up . She started to say something , then froze in mid-sentence and stared out over the ocean . " What ... ? " He sat up quickly and followed her gaze out toward the water , over his right shoulder . Something was rising off the water , and it took him a second to recognize it as a streak of incandescent reddish orange fire trailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ? " It looked like a skyrocket left over from the Fourth of July , but it was huge , too huge-and it was coming off the water . They both watched as it rose quickly , gathering speed as it ascended into the sky . It seemed to zigzag , then turn . Suddenly , a flash of light appeared in the sky , followed by a huge fireball . They scrambled to their feet and stared transfixed as pieces of fiery debris began raining down from the point of the explosion . About a half minute later , the sound of two explosions in quick succession rolled across the water and filled the air around them , causing them to instinctively flinch . Then , silence . The huge fireball seemed to hang in the air for a long time , then it began falling , breaking up into two or three fiery pieces , falling at different speeds . A minute later , the sky was clear , except for white and black smoke , illuminated from below by the glow of fires burning on the smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon , then at the sky , then back at the water , his heart beating rapidly . Jill whispered , " Oh , my God ... what ... ? " Bud stood motionless , not quite comprehending what he 'd just seen , but in his gut , he knew it was something terrible . His next thought was that whatever this was , it was big enough and loud enough to draw people toward the beach . He took Jill 's arm and said , " Let 's get out of here . Fast . " They turned and sprinted across the fifty yards of sand and up the dune . Bud grabbed the video camera and tripod as Jill scrambled down the far side of the dune . Bud followed and said , " Get dressed ! Get dressed ! " They both dressed quickly and ran toward the Explorer , Bud carrying the tripod and Jill carrying the camera , leaving the blanket and ice chest behind . They tossed the video equipment in the backseat , jumped in the front , and Bud started the Explorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . He left his headlights off , and with wheels spinning , he drove back to the trail and made a sharp right turn . He drove cautiously in the dark , along the nature trail , then through the parking field , and out onto Dune Road where he put on his headlights and accelerated . Neither of them spoke .
