<p> For a post-Valentine 's Day after-dinner mint , we offer more of the sweet little stories submitted by our readers . No matter how long they have been together , these couples can still clearly recall the date , place , time and most of all , the intensity of their emotions when they first met . Thanks to all who responded . <p> MY FAVORITE COP : He had her at ' Hello ' <p> Lisa always hated blind dates . <p> Even when her friend Jeff set her up with his twin brother , she had to be talked into it . Jeff and brother Scott were both officers with the DeKalb County Police Department at the time . <p> " I thought it was a total waste of time to spend a lunch hour sipping iced tea and eating salad , while trying to pretend to be interested in a conversation I could probably care less about , " she said . <p> She remembers glancing at her watch as she entered the restaurant , wondering how long she 'd have to stretch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the lettuce ! This twin turned out to be sweeter than the iced tea . <p> " He had me at ' Hello , ' " she said , recalling how the moment they met was a re-creation of the line from the movie " Jerry Maguire . " <p> Twelve years and two kids later , it does n't take much to produce that honeymoon glow for Lisa and Scott Meredith , who live in Snellville . <p> " My husband is the kind of man that makes you want to drop to your knees and thank God you 're a woman , " she said . <p> SOME ENCHANTED EVENING : A dance made in heaven <p> It was a Friday night in Palo Alto , Calif. , in 1982 , and Dianne wanted to dance . <p> Usually , she could count on assembling a crew from her office and hitting the town , but on this night , only her colleague Tom joined her . Since they came in and sat down together , others in the club apparently assumed they were a couple and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if they were going to do any dancing , they 'd have to be the ones to do the asking as well . <p> They each started scouting the floor for dance partners . Dianne spotted a young man and asked Tom if he thought the guy would dance with her . Tom said he looked like a good partner , but Dianne soon realized that Tom was looking at a different guy from the one she 'd picked . <p> She did n't want to embarrass Tom , so she approached the guy whom Tom had picked . She brought the guy , named Tony , back to the table , and at first it seemed that he had more in common with Tom . They were both born in Atlanta and were both avid Braves fans . <p> Tony asked Dianne for her phone number , but she figured he was only being polite because he did n't write it down . <p> The call came a week later . Tony had memorized the number . He asked her out , but she was busy the night he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How about tonight ?

" <p> The guys would hang out at her house in Kenmore , N.Y. , playing basketball in the side yard or football in the street . Sometimes , she was included in the games ; more often , she was n't . <p> As she lost the pounds and orthodontia of her adolescent years , the boys started to look at her in a different way  --  all except Dennis Benz , the one she 'd had her eye on since she was 10 . <p> She was almost out of high school before he finally asked her out . They went to the county fair . <p> " I was comfortable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " And I thought he had nice hands .

" Narrie remembers thinking . The date was for Friday night . <p> Things started off a little awkwardly when he picked up Nancy at her apartment . They quickly headed out to a trendy restaurant in Atlanta . He wondered whether they 'd have enough to talk about . <p> He need n't have worried . They talked through the appetizer , through dinner , through dessert and beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did the gentlemanly thing after midnight and bought a red rose from the strolling flower girl at the restaurant , " Steve recalled . <p> Then they talked some more . <p> The deeper the conversation went , the deeper they fell in love . The restaurant closed just before dawn , and so they finally had to leave . By then , it was Valentine 's Day . <p> Steve and Nancy Carrie , who now live in Centerville , were married the following May . <p> CAUTIOUS LOVE : Better the second time around <p> Divorced guys need love as much as anybody else . Sometimes , they 're just naturally a bit more circumspect about how they look for it . <p> James Stewart , a native Atlantan , knew that his chances of finding true love by answering a singles ad were not good . Especially this ad , the one placed by a transplanted Yankee lady . Reducing the romantic prospects even further , they seemed to share few compatibility features . He did n't like what the ad said she liked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk for the first encounter , so he arranged a lunch at a cafeteria in Decatur . <p> During the lunch , his date , Rhonda , talked about how she enjoyed activities like bowling and golf . Stewart did n't do either , but Rhonda had attracted him . He decided he could broaden his horizons , learn how to bowl and golf . <p> Later , Rhonda would tell him that she returned to her office from that lunch and told her co-workers that she 'd just met the man she was going to marry . <p> James took it a bit slower , but about a year and a half later , he and Rhonda were married . They 've been married for 14 years , and they live in Snellville with their two sons . <p> And when it comes to expressing his feelings for Rhonda , James is no longer guarded . <p> " When I look at her , it 's like seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time , " he said . " She 's simply amazing . " <p> THE WONDERING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll move from romantic love to tough love for next week 's column . <p> We all know that from a teenager 's point of view , parents just do n't get it . And the view is just as dark from the other side of the mirror . <p> Teens think parents are from another planet . Parents wish they could send their teens to another planet , at least till they 've navigated the pitfalls of puberty . <p> But just what is it that neither teens nor parents get ? <p> For the parents who respond to this call , please ask your teens to do the same . The best way to tell your story of communication troubles across the generation gap is with a story . It would be nice if the story had a happy ending , but if you had to settle for an armed truce , we 'll all understand . <p> Call Bill Osinski at 770-263-3853 , or e-mail bosinski@ajc.com.
