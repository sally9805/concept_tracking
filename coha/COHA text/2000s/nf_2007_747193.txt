Early on in case sensitive , Kate Greenstreet 's speaker - a speaker whose voice and sensibility feels consistent across this nevertheless wide-ranging collection - poses the central question of the text , " What 's the appeal of a mystery ? " And , then , she answers it , " Someone is looking for something , actively . " And is n't this why we turn to poems , to experience again and again this seeking ? <p> It is n't that Greenstreet does n't believe that we find things - in fact , the point may be in the end " to find love / to ' find ' love / to find ' love ' " - but here the journey , which is undertaken as a literal road trip , is at least as vital and as worthy of celebration and reflection as the fugitive arrival we think we want . The pleasure of any mystery is , after all , in the unfolding of the mystery , not in its resolution . " It 's a full life , collecting signals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea it should be / cleaner , easier , natural . " <p> case sensitive is a work of ' experimental ' poetry . At some point , current experimental poetry will presumably have other names , such as earlier objectivist or imagist poetics ( whose influences haunt this book in the spirit and words of Lorine Niedecker ) came to be categorized and distinguished . But to label something devoted to defying labels presents more problems than it solves . If this collection were a painting ( and Greenstreet is herself a painter and graphic designer ) , it would be more like the synthetic cubism and collage we associate with Picasso than either the tough geometric lines of Mondrian or the purely expressive fields of Rothko . As the speaker says of the place at which she finally settles , " How familiar it feels . Not like it 's my house , but like the house is my friend . " Though much of the narrative has been occluded or erased , the reader does not feel locked out ; the emotional terrain of the poems is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we arrive , but what story is n't ? " The subject is distant from and dark . / The subject is seen through glass . / The subject reflects , or has a luminous body . " In an interview ( archived on her website kickingwind.com ) , Greenstreet describes the act of making a poem as " a way to share a secret without telling it . " And we sense that we have indeed entered into an intimate exchange , all the more intimate , perhaps , because we can not easily articulate ( which is to say commodify , solidify , or reduce ) what is passing between and around us . From the opening line , she warns and reassures , " Many things about the story are puzzling . " <p> Although the collection is divided into five sections , a strong sense of cohesion prevails . The second section " SALT " provides one of the book 's central images , but there are other equally resonant nouns as well , including water , ice , glass , rock , and home - all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or shatter . Just as it is easy to misunderstand the aim of painterly abstraction as the desire to construct a purely hermeneutic domain to which the viewer has no access , we too often misread as exclusionary language that has been liberated from its expected roles . The function of the abstraction is not , however , to create a private experience but a universal one . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> And just as in ancient times salt could not be sufficiently sifted from sand , language , Greenstreet seems to imply , has long suffered from an analogous impurity : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> One byproduct of stripping words of their most obvious narrative uses and common syntax is that they seem suddenly to be always talking about themselves . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In this way words cease to be transparent - as " Colorless , tasteless , / not quite invisible " as salt - and become the foreground instead , material objects , which undergo a kind of chemical conversion , " ( the melting point the boiling point the melting point ) , " as they convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carelessly spent word " when used , loses itself , " we find ourselves suspecting that Greenstreet 's casual tone belies an attention to craft , especially sound , though she rarely seems to court conventional lyricism . Many of the pieces have , in fact , the shape of prose , and she is quick to undercut moments of elevation with snippets that mimic simple human speech . <p> In the final section , Diplomacy , the speaker proposes this : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Imagine a collection this self-aware . Greenstreet plays with the discouragement of narrative the way a photographer might play with film , employing stop-action , disjunction , and juxtaposition , so that what Pound called long ago " the luminous detail " - as often here a feeling or an intellectual observation as a concrete thing - might rise from the reels of our days , case sensitive is a book that locates itself in its traditions and sources : if we wander , we come by and by to landmarks we know , and those we do n't are duly footnoted . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undercurrent of solitude and danger . What attracts us is n't always safe ; to hope for real communication demands genuine risk . The beauty of the glowing thing can be deadly , and Greenstreet 's last reference plays Marie Curie 's radioactive minerals against the imagists ' delight . " This morning , cooking oatmeal in the yellow kitchen light , imagine the luminous treasures spread out on tables at the lab . Spontaneously luminous . " <p> Case , of course , is a word we recognize from the rhetoric of mystery , Perry Mason , a murder trail gone cold , but case is also a feature of grammar , the difference between the subject of the sentence and the object , the difference between possession and being possessed . Do we own our memories , our stories ? Or arc we owned by them ? If case sensitive feels at times as much like a memoir as a detective story , what 's harder to investigate than ourselves ? Our relationships to our pasts , to our inheritance , to the people we once were or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is not a vision of despair , but one of redemption , and tender wit . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Only if we can understand the difficulty of the task - how hard it is to " dislodge the lie " - will we be able to discover that we can do the work of making sense of the self and its desires . In this way , we might yet " dwell , " as Heidegger - whose words Greenstreet also appropriates - would have it . We might yet learn to live " inside the world ; " we might find a way to " reconstruct the room with our hands . " <p> By Kathleen Graber <p>
