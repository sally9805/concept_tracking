Idolon By Mark Budz Random House Mark Budz 1 White-hot fog . It boiled over the halogen-lighted streets-scalding to look at but cool against the skin . Kasuo van Dijk pulled his overcoat tighter against the dank mist , shut the door to his unmarked car , and stepped onto gritty concrete . This part of North Beach was philmed in classic noir . Most of the storefronts and apartment building facades were a melange of grays and blacks lifted from The Maltese Falcon , Raw Deal , and half a dozen other celluloids from the 1930s and ' 40s . In places , some of the architectural and decorative elements had been colorized . Vivid greens , reds , and blues bled from the shadows , saturating the landscape with flamboyant contusions of color borrowed from Romare Bearden and Warhol . Nothing was ever what it seemed , he reminded himself . Nor was it otherwise . A few blocks east of Hyde , toward Telegraph Hill , the decor changed abruptly to the delirious exuberance of Gaudi and Hundertwasser . Organic transmogrifications not unlike the Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haight-Ashbury . To the southwest , van Dijk could just make out the staid browns and clean , if somewhat stark , Edward Hopper lines of Pacific Heights . Van Dijk took a moment to philm himself in a composite image of Toshir Mifune , from Kurosawa 's Yojimbo , and Hiroyuki Sanada fromYaji Yamada 's The Twilight Samurai . The pseudoself-humble demeanor hiding implacable , barely restrained violence-was what people not only expected from him , given his first name , but respected . It was part of the job , like wearing a tie and an HK 9mm minicentrifuge . He started toward the small **34;1516;TOOLONG warehouse that had been converted into low-income apartments . A uniformed officer stood guard outside the first-floor entrance , the tip of a cigarette flaring from time to time like the beacon in a lighthouse . The uniform 's name appeared in front of him : Kohl , Peter . Van Dijk cleared the eyefeed with a quick mental Delete and turned his gaze on the street cop . " Detective . " Kohl pulled himself out of his slouch . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My partner . Janakowski . He 's inside , waiting for you and the crime-scene boyz to show . " Kohl took a final calming pull on his Hongtasan , then flicked it nervously away . The butt hissed as it arced to the ground , sputtering out before it struck the damp concrete . Oily steam snaked up from a half-empty cup of black coffee at his feet . " Who found the body ? " " One of the residents . " Kohl blinked as he accessed an online police log . " Girl named Lisette , " he said , reading from the plog . " Age eleven . Lives in the apartment just down the hall , supposedly with her mother . But Mom ai n't around . Has n't been for a while , by the look of it . " The victim 's apartment was on the second floor . Van Dijk checked the elevator for obvious evidence . It was out of order . That left the stairs . Stairwells tended to collect all kinds of DNA-marinated detritus . Cigarette butts , half-empty plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye droppers , and dermadots for those who could n't afford or did n't want direct deposit via mechemical assembly . As he mounted the concrete steps , a number of crumpled candy wrappers chirped to life , regaling him with cheerful play lists and animated nanoFX . In the hall , van Dijk made his way past Teflon-white doors set in gray cinder block . Janakowski waited on the left , at the far end . As van Dijk passed the next-to-the-last door on the right , it opened a fraction , revealing a pair of luminous blue eyes . The eyes met his for a beat , then retreated . The door snicked shut . Lisette . Van Dijk moved past the door , dropping the thin smile from his face . He greeted Janakowski with a curt nod . " You need me for anything , Detective ? " The officer stepped away from the sealed door and hitched up his belt , anxious to get going . Van Dijk tipped his head back down the hall . " That the girl ? " " Yeah . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LED ceiling lights . Someone had taped red paper , printed with white flowers , to the panels . The black desiccated shadows of dead bugs speckled the underside of the paper and the dim lantern glow . " Keep the kid company till I 'm finished in here . " " I got ta take a leak . " " In that case , you better get Kohl to relieve you . " " Very funny , Detective . " The officer ambled down the hall , his brow furrowed in concentration as he messaged his partner . Van Dijk logged into SFPD central data , allocated a new library for the case , then pushed open the door to the victim 's apartment . *** The body was philmed in vintage Hollywood . It had that silver-screen patina , glam even in death . Angelic hair , sassy red lips , gold-sequined gown , a cheap diamond necklace and earrings . Except for the costume jewelry , it was all high-end ware , all programmable . Van Dijk mentally queried the SFPD datician assigned to him . Image ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara Stanwyck and Gene Tierney , " the sageware said after a moment . The woman lay on a tempergel futon against one wall . Glossy satin sheets covered the mattress . A fluffy down comforter , white as snow , spilled off the end of the bed like a glacier . Record , van Dijk thought , activating the nanocams embedded in his retinas . Visual . Audio . Ambients . Auto upload . Save . There was a brief delay as the microvilli array of nanoelectrodes in his skull picked up the neural firing pattern for each command and relayed it to a brain-computer interface interpreter , which in turn routed it to a datician for implementation . He panned the room slowly . Intermittent temperature , humidity , and time readings blinked along the bottom of his field of view . Other than the futon , there was n't much . A table and chair . A graphene d-splay screen , tuned to some ambient meditation channel soft-focused on lotus leaves . A collapsible plastic shelf , bare except for several pairs of shoes , loose jeans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose herself in . Lose herself from who ? van Dijk wondered . All that nice philmware . Why would she want to hide it , even if it was ripped ? Through the window opposite the futon he had a clear view of Telegraph Hill , all blue-striped trees and green-scaled buildings . Where she was headed-or what she was running from ? Either possibility seemed likely . Nothing in the bathroom . The usual assortment of toiletries , hair- and toothbrushes , patchouli-scented soap . No makeup , but then she would n't need it with the philm she was waring . Nothing in the tiny kitchenette , either . There was no stove , only a hot plate on the countertop . The refrigerator was small , barely large enough for the six-pack of bottled water and jar of Cajun simmer sauce . It was n't the kitchen of a chef . Which meant she 'd eaten out a lot , probably at the fast-food franchises along the Marina and the Embarcadero . Van Dijk turned his attention to the body . It looked as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long was hard to tell at this point . Her skin was cool , but electronic skin skewed all of the normal postmortem signs of death , everything from body temp to lividity and rigor . E-skin typically slowed the rate at which a body cooled , but not always . He was n't even sure of her age at this point . ' Skin had a way of overwriting not just the physical but the perceived . The mind filled in blanks it should n't , the way it did a missing word , supplying implicit meaning rather than explicit . " ID , " he said out loud , scanning the victim 's DiNA code . There was a brief pause as the datician searched for the information . " Unknown , " it replied over his earfeed . " Not On File . " NOF meant one of two things : either the bar-code-encrypted concatenation of her DNA had been tweaked , or she was an unchipped and undocumented immigrant . The cause of death was n't immediately obvious . There were no external injuries-strangle marks , suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No blood or other fluids . That left the less obvious . Drug overdose , or viral or bacterial infection from dirty e-skin were the most common . Internal injuries were possible , as were natural causes , but not likely under the circumstances . Which were . . . ? Van Dijk had no idea . Footsteps echoed in the hallway . Van Dijk stood . End , he thought , terminating the superimposed readout just as the crime scene unit , led by Leslie Apodaca , appeared in the doorway . " All yours , " he said . " What have you got ? " Apodaca said . She was a petite woman , short in both height and temper . Even her hair , as close-cropped as that of a soldier or Buddhist monk , sent a clear don't-mess-with-me . " What you see . " Van Dijk nodded at the body . " I just got here a few minutes ago . " " Who is she ? " " NOF . " " Figures . " Apodaca messaged her team to scan for finger- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millimeter of the room with chemical tweezers in the hunt for soft DNA , fibers , hazmat , and biomat . Van Dijk headed for the door . " Do n't forget to copy me on the report . " " You 're not gon na stick around ? " Apodaca did n't bother to look up from the body . " I 'm saving myself for the autopsy . " The door to the kid 's apartment stood open a crack . As he stepped inside , a toilet flushed . The small studio apartment was sparsely furnished-none of the furniture matched , he noted-and empty . The door to the bathroom opened and Janakowski came out , zipping up . " I was gon na bust a pipe , " he said . " Where 's the girl ? " van Dijk said . " Kohl looking after her ? " Janakowski shot a panicked glance in the direction of the kitchen , where a Vurtronic d-splay pasted to one of the cupboards flickered with Chinamation ghosts . " She was right there . " 2 The Transcendental Vibrationists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pelayo Tiutoj thought . Instead of the familiar collection of rose-stem bones and clockwork joints the TVs had been screening for months , there was nothing but static . Background radiation from the universe . A small group of worshippers had gathered in the War Memorial park across the street from Iosepa Biognost Tek 's downtown Santa Cruz office . Pelayo counted five in the gathering . The TVs huddled in a tight cluster at the foot of a squat palm , rocking in unison and chanting benignly to themselves . Their loose , resham-style robes had coin-sized pieces of glass sewn onto the fabric , which spat thorny flashes of light at him . The other loiterers in the park were doing their best to avoid or ignore the meditation session . They sipped cappuccinos . Window-shopped the d-splays pasted to the bricks of the central clock tower . Watched the graphene leaves on the War Memorial tree flicker with the faces of the dead . One of the TVs looked up , caught Pelayo 's gaze , and held it with vacant black eyes . A whiff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man 's lips moved . " What ? " Pelayo asked before he could catch himself . The man 's lips moved again , a barely audible hiss of burn-in-hell vitriol . " Slavation is near . " Pelayo flipped off the TV . Knee-jerk response . Most TVs did n't hemorrhage goodwill . They could n't give a rat 's ass what people thought of them . They knew , deep down in their sanctimonious hearts , that they were ascending to the Omega point while everyone else rotted in this pisshole of a life . A sly Mona Lisa sfumato darkened the corners of the TV 's mouth before he bent his head in prayer . Santa Cruz . The town had always been schizophrenic . Place could n't decide if it was a retirement community or a Mecca for hippie nostalgia and political radicals . Social activism on one hand and conservative fundamentalists on the other . Self-styled liberals came to steep in the tireless counterculture aura and convince themselves they really were open-minded . Others came to be part of The Endless Summer surf scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or walk in the footsteps of the Tick Talk Man in Cryptaphica . Pelayo shifted his attention to the off the shelf philms the street crowd was waring . He liked to stay current . Fashion changed quickly . There was no predicting a smart mob . No forecasting when a spontaneous commercial consensuality would precipitate out of the cinesphere . Nagel was popular , with his noir , razor-edged beauty . So was Beardsley-erotic , sensual . Still in demand after a month , along with the usual Jung at Heart variations , Giger cyborganics , and Picasso-inspired cubism that always seemed to be in vogue . There were even a few F8 cameos . The band had recently uploaded a new cast . The song , titled " As F8 Would Have It , " had spiked at number one at least once a day for ten consecutive days . A megahit . So now all of the pop cult philmheads and vidIOs wanted to look like they 'd just stepped out of the cast and onto the sidewalk . The majority of the e-skin out there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondhand , street cheap , or black-market celluloid . Thin membranes of programmable graphene-fabricated out of nanoscopic semiconductor threads-that were capable of displaying not only graphics but texture . As a result , Pelayo saw a lot of monochromatics cruising the streets-stripped down black-and-white pseudoselves that people hoped to colorize later . Pelayo was lucky ; his ' skin was fully chromatic . One of the perks he received as a test subject for Iosepa Biognost Tek . IBT provided him with the latest experimental ware . The only downside was , he never knew what he was going to look like until it was too late . Last time around , he 'd ended up with Aubrey Beardsley breasts , Jackson Pollock hair , and Tiffany-esque stained-glass lips . Mix-and-match shit he would n't normally be caught dead in . This time , he hoped , would be different . He returned his attention to the TVs . They liked to think they were different . But they were just the same as everyone else , philming themselves to change the way they looked and who they were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was who they would become . Hyperreal and ultimately hyperstantial . That was the plan-the hope . He logged into the public datician and checked the time : 9:46 . Fourteen minutes until his appointment . He 'd gotten the message yesterday . Short notice , and a couple of weeks sooner than expected . Usually , he went twelve weeks between reconfigures . Continues ...
