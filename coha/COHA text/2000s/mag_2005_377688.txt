Officials in Stratford , Conn. , convened a group of middle and high school students last year to quiz them on their attitudes toward alcohol . The officials were dismayed , if not surprised , when the teens reported that they thought alcohol , unlike tobacco and other drugs , was largely harmless , that binge drinking among their peers was habitual , and that drinking enough to pass out was funny . But the officials were perhaps most displeased to hear that the place kids most often got drunk was their own or their friends ' homes and that some parents either provided alcohol or looked the other way if teens brought it to drink in the backyard or basement . <P> Spurred in part by that information , the Stratford town council is considering an ordinance that would allow police to enter a private residence if they suspect someone under 21 is consuming liquor , even if adults are present . Dubbed the house-party ordinance , it has been adopted in 43 of the state 's 169 municipalities , but in Stratford it has split neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb underage drinking and those who argue that it undermines parental authority and violates privacy rights . <P> Most teens still do their drinking when adults are n't around . But many parents have concluded that teen drinking is inevitable , and given the options , they prefer to have their kids drink at home under adult supervision rather than in a park or parking lot . Some parents even play host to " tent " parties , at which they confiscate car keys and provide a place for kids to spend the night . Public opinion , however , seems to be against that approach , and state and local governments are beginning to enact laws designed to stem underage drinking by targeting adults . Adults face six months in jail , for example , under a law passed in Kansas in 2003 , if they allow anyone under 21 to drink in their home ( an exception is made for giving one 's child beer ) . A similar bill is pending in Wyoming . In Connecticut , enthusiasm for house-party ordinances is picking up momentum , with 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Legislation has also been proposed to adopt a statewide law . <P> Proponents of the Connecticut ordinances say they address a loophole in the state law that makes it a crime for anyone under 21 to drink on public property but does not prohibit drinking in private homes . " If police go to a home and look through a window and see a kid drinking beer , there 's nothing they can do unless they 're invited in , " says Craig Turner , vice chair of the Connecticut Coalition to Stop Underage Drinking ( CCSUD ) , which has been a major force in pushing for the ordinances . " And even if they manage to get invited in , the only thing they can do is ask the kids to pour the liquor out or nab a kid if he creates a disturbance when he leaves the house . " Under the house-party law , drinking by anyone under 21 on private property is a crime . Police can enter a home and issue citations and fines to both minors and any adults present whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from town to town , but the fines generally range from $50 to $100 , with a first offense considered an infraction and the second a misdemeanor . Exceptions are made for kids who drink when their parent or legal guardian is present , but even if teens have their parents ' permission to drink at a friend 's house , they are in violation if that parent is not on the premises .
