<p> Rick Caruso has a name for the spirit that imbues his hugely successful outdoor shopping centers in Southern California : " Caruso-Style . " <p> The Los Angeles developer spends lavishly on flourishes like street lamps and phone booths from Italy , granite cobblestones , limestone storefront columns , and entertainment features such as a fountain that spouts in choreographed synchrony with Frank Sinatra music . <p> Now Caruso , 46 , wants to bring his signature touch to the Bay Area for the first time by building a nearly $200 million " lifestyle center " on a piece of East Bay waterfront land he fell in love with for its breathtaking vistas of San Francisco , the Golden Gate Bridge and Mount Tamalpais . <p> " It 's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build on the waterfront with that kind of view , " Caruso said of the 45-acre site in Albany that is mostly a little-used parking lot on the north side of the Golden Gate Fields horse racing track , which is owned by Magna Entertainment Corp . of Canada . <p> In recent weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , with plazas , a farmers ' market , outdoor dining overlooking the bay  --  and perhaps a hotel , a five-level parking lot and as many as 200 apartments with concierge and maid service . <p> The project would be a crown jewel for Caruso , the wealthy Republican son of Dollar Rent A Car founder Henry Caruso , who is a major political fundraiser and a friend and Brentwood neighbor of Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger . <p> But the swanky developer is in for a battle in Albany , a city of 17,000 north of Berkeley whose main street is a collection of mom-and-pop shops and where it was big news when a Target store opened a year ago just across Interstate 80 from where Caruso wants to build . <p> " We 're adamantly opposed . We 're going to fight . We just ca n't roll over for this , " said former Mayor Robert Cheasty , who thinks racetrack owner Magna  --  despite corporate representations  --  will eventually leave Albany because of declining attendance at the racetrack , and the city should plan to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Citizens for East Shore Parks , a coalition of individuals and groups that has fought commercial development of the East Bay waterfront since 1985 and has been instrumental in the creation of 8.5 miles of parks from Emeryville to Richmond . In 1990 , he helped lead a successful ballot measure that requires voter approval for any zoning changes to the city 's shoreline . <p> No stranger to politics , Caruso has been running a sophisticated campaign for a year to win local hearts and minds before filing a development application , which he expects to do in the first quarter of 2006 . <p> He has employed a public relations firm run by former Berkeley Democratic state Assemblywoman Dion Aroner , conducted private polls , sent out multiple mailers to 7,000 Albany households and followed up with telephone calls , hosted dozens of meetings in people 's homes as well as four public open houses , and joined local business groups . <p> Some Albany residents are thrilled by what they 've seen , saying they would love to be able to stay in town for shopping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfront with a commercial enterprise of questionable aesthetics . <p> " I know they are trying to create this small-town ambience with their architecture , which I think is totally fake , " said Kathy Farley , an interior designer . " To me , it 's like Disneyland . " <p> Caruso has cited Walt Disney 's extensive writings on town planning and fantasyland creation  --  as well as the city centers of Europe  --  as sources of inspiration for his designs . He employed a Walt Disney designer for the electric trolley that runs the length of his Los Angeles mall called the Grove , the simulated Italianate village that Caruso 's firm says draws 18 million visitors a year . <p> He also has a flair for showmanship . This month , for example , he began the holiday season at the Grove with the nationally televised lighting of a 110-foot-tall Christmas tree in a ceremony featuring Teri Hatcher of TV 's " Desperate Housewives " and composer and performer Burt Bacharach , among other stars . The event concluded with an imitation snowstorm made from gelatin that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Caruso insists he is willing to tailor his East Bay project to local aesthetics . <p> " Tell me what you want , and we 'll see what we can do , " he told a small group of residents during a recent gathering in a supporter 's home , where attendees munched on homemade brownies while Caruso and several consultants displayed renditions of the proposed mall on a portable screen . <p> " It has to be organic , like it 's always been there , " the tanned , slender and finely suited Caruso said later , as he toured some of his 40 commercial properties in Southern California in a black Lincoln Navigator . <p> At the Lakes in Thousand Oaks , in Ventura County , Caruso said residents wanted outdoor skating in winter , so he produced a seasonal ice skating rink that appears to float on one of two artificial lakes that are connected by a stream that tumbles over rocky waterfalls . <p> There is also a large lawn surrounded by trees , a walking path , an artificial beach and  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wife and children cavorting in and around water features . <p> " It 's very magical , " said Melissa Tonery , who takes her home-schooled 8-year-old son to the shopping center for outings . " The kids love it . " <p> Caruso knows the origins of every finish in his projects : the custom stained-glass light fixtures , the centuries-old statues from a French estate , the brass trash can lids . He said he personally approves all plant choices because his grandfather ran a nursery . <p> Attention to such details , Caruso said , helps create a place that people want to visit whether they are shopping or not . That is good business , he said , shown by the fact that sales on his properties run 40 percent above the industry average . <p> He estimates that the Albany project would generate $2 million in new tax revenue annually for a city with a current general fund of $11 million . <p> In the public realm , Caruso has shown repeatedly that he is not afraid of a fight . <p> This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall chain , General Growth Properties of Chicago , which sponsored an unsuccessful ballot initiative to try to stop him from building a $264 million outdoor mall in Glendale . An attorney by training , Caruso is now suing General Growth for anticompetitive practices . <p> Caruso also was president of the Los Angeles Police Commission in 2002 when it made the controversial decision to get rid of African American police Chief Bernard Parks and hire current Chief William Bratton . <p> Caruso  --  who is working on three other major retail projects in the state , including one at Magna 's Santa Anita horse racing track outside Los Angeles  --  says he hopes to convince environmentalists in the East Bay that a quality retail project will provide money to set aside open space and make the waterfront more inviting . <p> He has promised to spend millions of dollars to restore and expand the beach , build a long-planned Bay Trail link , create a 2-acre grassy park and an outdoor amphitheater , rebuild a decrepit pier , restore and expand marshland and build a wetlands interpretive center for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered the local YMCA an exercise center at no charge for 25 years , promised to sponsor free concerts and other arts offerings , as he does elsewhere , and underwrite a trolley to the Solano Avenue business district , as he did in Calabasas to connect his mall to the city 's old town and stimulate business in the surrounding area . <p> Should voters reject all those goodies , however , Caruso says the system will have worked . <p> " If Albany votes our proposal down , that 's OK . That 's the process we bought into , " he said . " We can handle it . We 're big boys . " <p> Rick J.
