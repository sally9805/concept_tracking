Judd gently lowered the guard to the ground , knowing the man had died trying to protect Buck Williams and the others in the Tribulation Force . Footsteps pounded on the stage above them . Lionel grabbed the guard 's walkie-talkie . " Come on , we have to get out of here ! " Judd and Lionel rolled under the stage and held their breath . The radio squawked in Lionel 's hand . He turned it down . Two guards jumped from the stage and felt for a pulse on the downed guard . One barked into his radio , " He 's dead , sir . " A voice shot back , " Find the rabbi and those others . I want them dead before they get out of the stadium ! " Judd whispered to Lionel , " We 've got to stop them ! " But before Judd could move , another voice blared on the guard 's radio . " We 've spotted them in a Mercedes a few blocks from the stadium , sir . " " Probably headed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! " Judd sighed . " Nothing we can do now . " The stadium was nearly empty . A few stragglers knelt near the stage , praying . Medical personnel attended to the injured . Judd and Lionel watched from the shadows as GC peacekeepers dragged the dead guard away . A cameraman flipped on a light , and a reporter stepped in front of it . " We are live at Teddy Kollek Stadium , " the reporter said . " Just moments ago , this Global Community peacekeeper was murdered at the conference called the Meeting of the Witnesses . Those in the audience listened to a message of love and peace , but it seems someone did not follow their leader 's teaching . " " No way one of the witnesses shot that guard , " Lionel said . Judd gritted his teeth . " Carpathia will make Tsion look " " What ? " Lionel said . Judd spied a heavyset boy near the front row . " I know that kid , " he said . When the Global Community guards were gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the boy . The boy 's mouth dropped open . " Judd , " the boy said , " what are you doing here ? " " How do I know you ? " Judd said . " I 'm Samuel . Nina and Dan Ben-Judah were my neighbors . " Samuel had given Judd the video of the murders of Tsion 's family . " I wondered what happened to you , " Judd said . " They took the video you gave me and " " We should not stay here , " Samuel interrupted . " Come with me . " " We have to find our friend , " Lionel said . " You can find him later , " Samuel said . " The followers of the rabbi are in danger . Come to my house . " Judd told Samuel their things were at the university . Samuel said , " We will go there on the way . Quickly ! My father must not see you . " " Why not ? " Judd said . " He is working with the Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them about Melinda . Phoenix ran beside her , clearly glad to be free from the rope and tape Melinda had wrapped around his legs . When Vicki entered , Darrion held up a hand . " Just a minute , " Vicki said , " I need to talk to you all . " " But something terrible 's happened ! " Darrion said . Vicki yelled . " Please ! Melinda 's gone ! She tied Phoenix up and left . " Conrad said , " How long ago ? " " I ca n't tell , " Vicki said . " Let 's search the house and the woods . " " I 'll check the shed for the motorcycle , " Conrad said . " Sorry , Darrion , " Vicki said , " but this is important . " Darrion hung her head . " I thought you 'd be concerned about Judd and Lionel and Mr. Stein . " " What do you mean ? " " Shots were fired at the stadium . " Vicki put a hand over her mouth . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm scared , Vick . " " Judd and Lionel can take care of themselves , " Vicki said , hugging Darrion . The kids found no trace of Melinda in the house . Conrad said , " At least she did n't take the last motorcycle . She has to be on foot . " Vicki looked at her watch . " Plenty of daylight left , but we have to spread out . " Conrad and Darrion roared off on the motorcycle toward the main road . The others split up on foot . Vicki prayed as she ran into the woods . GC emergency vehicles stopped traffic as Judd walked with Lionel and Samuel to the university . Lionel turned up the walkie-talkie and heard peacekeepers relaying information . " They must be checking every car , " Judd said . " The GC are very upset about the rabbi and what he has done , " Samuel said . Judd turned . " Why are you helping us ? You 're not a follower of Dr. Ben-Judah . " " How do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We can tell . " " Nina and Dan were my friends , " Samuel said . " I feel terrible about what happened to them . I would not want to see the same thing happen to you . " Hundreds of witnesses gathered outside the gymnasium . A commotion at the front caught Judd 's attention . GC guards led a dozen people from the building . " What 's going on ? " Judd asked a man nearby . " They are arresting the local committee , " the man said . Yitzhak Weizmann , the man who had given them shelter before the meetings began , was being led away in handcuffs . Behind him stood other committee members , including the meeting emcee . The man next to Judd said , " They suspect the group is hiding the rabbi . " Judd gasped . The last man out the door was Mr. Stein . Judd shouted and waved and pushed his way to the front , but a uniformed officer appeared at the door with a bullhorn . " Attention , everyone who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bullhorn to another man , who repeated his statement in several different languages . " This is a crime scene , " the man continued . " We have your belongings , and we will keep them until this situation is resolved . " " Mr. Stein 's money ! " Lionel whispered . " That 's the only way we 're getting home . " " Form a single line to register for your belongings , " the officer said . People lined up , but Samuel pulled Judd and Lionel away . " Do not give them your names . Come with me . " " We have to help Mr. Stein , " Judd said . " I can help you get him out , " Samuel said , " but you must come with me . " Judd and Lionel followed Samuel back into the traffic near the stadium . They got in a cab , but the driver yelled at Samuel in Hebrew , and the three retreated . " What did he say ? " Judd said . " He cursed at us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not move . " They walked through the congested streets . " You have heard about the meeting at the Wailing Wall tomorrow ? " Samuel said . " We 'll be there , " Judd said . " Do n't , " Samuel said . " The GC are planning to execute Dr. Ben-Judah . " " Carpathia promised he was n't going to hurt anybody , " Lionel said . " They 're going to make it look like a terrorist attack , " Samuel said . " You know this because of your father ? " Judd said . Samuel nodded . " Why did he let you go to that meeting ? " Lionel said . " He did n't know , " Samuel said . " I came on my own . " They passed a crowded bar , and a photo of the guard Judd had met flashed on a big- screen television inside . Beneath his photo were the years of his birth and death . " Wish I could hear this , " Judd said . " We 're not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can watch there . " Lionel pulled Judd aside . " His father 's working with the GC ! " " He trusted me with the videotape . He 's okay . He wants to help . " " But he does n't have the mark . " " Maybe we can change that , " Judd said . Conrad and Darrion returned and met Vicki and the others near the shed to discover that still no one had seen Melinda . " I say we head toward town , " Darrion said . Vicki 's weird friend Charlie walked up . " What are you guys going to do with her after you catch her ? " Vicki looked at the others and shrugged . " Drag her back here ? " Conrad scratched his chin . " I do n't care . I just want to find her . " " Maybe she does n't want to rat us out , " Vicki said . " Maybe she just wants to get away . " Shelly agreed . " Tsion 's message could have been too much for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might run into the GC , " Conrad said , " which would be the end for her . Let me at least stay on the road awhile . " Judd and Lionel crept to the back door of Samuel 's house and followed him in . Emergency vehicles screamed by , sirens blaring . Samuel answered the ringing phone . " My father , " he mouthed . " Did he tell you what 's happening ? " Judd said as Samuel hung up . " He told me to stay inside . The crazy zealots are killing people . " Samuel turned on the television , and the photo of the guard flashed on the screen again . Another photo appeared beside the guard . " It 's Buck ! " Lionel shouted . The news anchor looked grim . " Global Community forces believe this videotape reveals this man as the murderer at Teddy Kollek Stadium . The suspect has been identified as American Cameron Williams , former employee of the GC publishing division . Williams is reportedly staying with Rabbi Tsion Ben-Judah at the home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio squawked . " Proceeding to the Rosenzweig estate , " a man said . " That is only a few blocks from here , " Samuel said . Leon Fortunato , Nicolae Carpathia 's right-hand man , appeared on the screen at a news conference . " We will do what we must to bring these criminals to justice . We have witnesses to the act , a videotape recording , and several of the local committee members in custody . Rest assured , we will bring to justice the man or woman who did this . " " Buck was running away when the guard was shot , " Lionel said . " The videotape has to show that . " " The truth never stops these people , " Judd said . Samuel brought snacks , and Judd and Lionel ate as they watched the news and monitored the guard 's radio . " Has your dad always worked for the GC ? " Lionel said . Samuel shook his head . " Only since the murder of Dr. Ben-Judah 's family . My father had helped them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned his faith . My father went totally for the Global Community and Nicolae Carpathia . He works " A roar went over the house . Judd ran to the window and saw a brilliant flash . " A GC chopper , " Samuel said . " Closing in on Buck and Tsion , I bet , " Judd said . " We have to help . " " You ca n't go there , " Samuel said . " These are our friends , " Judd said . " We might be able to do something . " Samuel told them how to find the Rosenzweig estate , then turned on a light at the rear of the house . " If this light is off when you return , tap on my window and I 'll let you in . " The night air was cool and the streets almost deserted . Judd and Lionel rounded a corner and saw two squad cars parked in front of a huge gate . They could hear the chopper nearby . Lionel listened to the banter of the GC peacekeepers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chopper hovered over the estate , then put down on top of the house . " They 're going in through the roof , " Lionel said . Judd peered through the darkness at the GC insignia on the side of the chopper . Three figures leaped into the helicopter just before it lifted off and headed north , a few feet above the rooftops . Another chopper approached from the south and hovered directly over them . The frantic voice of the pilot came over the radio , trying to communicate with the other chopper . " Tsion and Buck have to be in the first chopper , " Judd said . " Who else was with them ? " Lionel said . " Chloe ? " Judd shrugged . " Let 's head back to Samuel 's house before they spot us . " Just after 1 a.m . Judd and Lionel found the light off . Judd tapped lightly on Samuel 's window . A light came on over the door . Judd and Lionel climbed the steps and waited . Something moved behind them . Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I told you they 'd come back ! " Judd turned . A man stood behind them , holding a gun . " Good work , Son . "
