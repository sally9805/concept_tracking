<p> Checking out Asian American Web sites is n't just a hobby for Nelson Wong , it 's " a passion . " <p> The San Francisco native figures he spends about 20 hours a week surfing sites that are produced by or for the most wired ethnic group in the United States : Asian Americans . <p> And on his own site , AArising.com , probably the oldest of them all , Wong has posted links to some 2,500 sites . They range from individual " blogs "  --  a new Net contraction for personal e-zines , or " Web logs , " that offer comment on everything from TV shows to cars to love  --  to the high-profile commercial venture aOnline.com , which was recently launched by nationally known aMagazine . <p> In many ways , Wong is the prime target for a new crop of commercial sites like aOnline.com , Click2Asia.com , AsianConnections.com , AsiaDera.com and Onna.com that are eyeing profits in the diverse marketplace of Asians online . <p> And so far , he says , nobody has hit the target . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be barking up the wrong tree , " said Wong , a 33-year-old Web designer who lives and works in San Francisco . " I do n't see anything out there that 's a moneymaker . " <p> Jeff Yang , founder and chief executive of aMagazine and aOnline.com , hopes to change that . He knows commercial Asian American sites that have come and gone , but he believes the time is right for a breakthrough . <p> " We 're sitting on something that is either going to be a gold mine or a land mine , " said Yang , who is moving the headquarters of his 10-year-old company aMedia Inc. from New York to San Francisco in August . <p> By all accounts , Asian Americans are the most wired " community " on the Internet . <p> Two leading Internet research firms , Forrester Research Inc. and Jupiter Communications Inc. , both say 69 percent of Asian American households , about 2.2 million total , are online . According to census estimates , there are about 11 million U.S. residents of Asian ancestry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the online penetration of Asian American households should jump to 84 percent by 2005 . By comparison , about 54 percent of all Caucasian households were online this year , a percentage that should jump to 76 percent in 2005 , the Jupiter report said . <p> And in an April report , Forrester Research said 61 percent of Asian American households have made a purchase online , and in the last quarter of 1999 , they spent an average of $331 online . Latino and Caucasian households spent $254 online during the same period . <p> The reality , though , is that the term Asian American does not refer to a singular entity , but a variety of people of various ethnic backgrounds , cultures and interests from countries throughout the Asia-Pacific Island and South Asia regions , such as China , Japan , the Philippines , Vietnam and India . <p> " The Asian American community is probably the toughest to target as a homogenous community because they are so diverse , " said Ekaterina Walsh , a Forrester Research analyst who has followed Asian American Web sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right for a Web site that creates more of an Asian American community . He believes his new aOnline.com Asian American Digital Network , formally launched earlier this month , will become a " virtual hub " for everything from " advertising to political organizing . " <p> " We had to go where Asian Americans are , and where we are is the Internet , " Yang said . " Our goal is to create a consumer market for Asian Americans . " <p> Yang 's aMedia Inc. , which is moving into a 20,000-square-foot office at Market and Sixth streets , is hoping to build on the success of its 10-year-old flagship aMagazine , a bimonthly publication with about 200,000 subscribers that tracks culture and politics in the various Asian American communities . The company has also ventured into book publishing with titles " I Am Jackie Chan : My Life in Action . " <p> Yang is cognizant that a number of Asian American portals have tried and failed . A prime example is the defunct Channel A of Los Altos , which started as a news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue . <p> " We did n't see why people would come back repeatedly and buy a set of Yan Can Cook Chopsticks , ' " said Yang , who hired Channel A co-founder Steven Chin , a former San Francisco Examiner reporter , as aOnline 's Web development director . <p> For aOnline.com , Yang hopes to draw readers by combining the print magazine 's content with original Web features on subjects like imprisoned Los Alamos nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee or a report on violence against Asian Americans on college campuses . The company is beefing up its staff of editors , writers and free-lancers from eight last year to nearly 40 this year , Yang said . <p> Moreover , aOnline wants to become the hub in a network of Asian American community groups by offering Web production services to groups like the Organization of Chinese Americans . <p> And aOnline hopes to increase its audience with entertainment , especially with Internet music becoming one of the hottest activities on the Web . <p> Yang said the company is negotiating to buy an independent record label and plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian American artists and filmmakers through streaming video and audio . That will be important as more consumers switch to high-speed broadband Internet connections , both in the United States and abroad , he said . <p> " Asia itself is not yet a consumer market for broadband media , but within two years , Asia is going to be the single largest Internet market in the world , " Yang said . " They 'll need something to fill those fat pipes . " <p> The competition among Asian American portals is already heating up , each offering a potpourri of news , features and entertainment to entice Asian and Asian American Web surfers , although only two had sufficient traffic for Web research firm PC Data Online to report . <p> Los Angeles ' Click2Asia.com , for example , launched in August armed with investors that include Gareth Chang , chairman of Asian broadcaster StarTV . Along with wire service news from Asia , the site last week offered Asian music videos , clips from a supermodel contest and an interview with actress Julia Roberts . <p> The site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 109,000 unique users in April to 376,000 in May , reaching about 0.5 percent of the total number of Internet users , according to PC Data Online . <p> The other site , AsianAvenue.com , launched in 1997 in New York , had 170,000 unique users in May , up from 111,000 the month before . AsianConnections.com , of Newport Beach , offers articles by famed former Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong-Torres and popular TV chef Martin Yan . And last week , visitors would have found links to exclusive video interviews with " Mission : Impossible 2 " director John Woo and " Shanghai Noon " star Jackie Chan . <p> Some are targeting a narrow audience . Onna.com , a San Francisco company that had a " soft launch " of its site in May , hopes to attract an audience from the 6.4 million Japanese-speaking women living in Japan who use the Web , said founder Hiroko Shimo . <p> The company , whose name translates to " woman " in Japanese , decided to base operations locally because technology investors and marketers who want to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AsianScene.com Inc. of San Francisco , which says it has counted about 700,000 unique users since its launch in August 1998 , targets " generation Y Asians of ages 15-25 " with information about everything " from car shows to parties . " <p> Startup AsiaDera.com of Fremont also wanted to target a specific audience , the Filipino American market , said founder Armand Cacacho . <p> But Cacacho , whose main business is construction management , said that in a time when big dot-coms are failing , he feels the pressure from investors to show the site can generate money and not just eyeballs . <p> So the site now sells toys , and Cacacho is working on deals with real estate agents to list homes . AsiaDera.com also offers free Internet access and long-distance Internet phone service and features video from television networks in the Philippines , Hong Kong , Singapore and Japan . <p> " The rules have changed , " Cacacho said . " If you do n't have sales , you do n't have anything . " <p> And Forrester 's Walsh said she so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian Americans will make money . She said aOnline might have a chance because , like African American media company BET.com , it can leverage the drawing power of its print publication . <p> But in general , she said sites have to target a specific group to succeed , and Walsh said even Onna.com 's focus is n't narrow enough . She said ethnic Web sites that are as narrowly focused as one for 16-to-28-year-olds who like a certain type of music might stand a chance . <p> Maybe that 's why there 's more of an explosion of noncommercial " blogs " that deal with such topics as lifestyles , imported cars and Asian American fashion models , said AArising 's Wong , who adds about eight to 10 new links every three days on his site , launched in the now-ancient Web days of 1993 . <p> " I find them much more compelling , " Wong said . " That 's where the biggest growth has been , but it 's not necessarily where you 're going to make any money . " <p> E-mail Benny Evangelista @ @
