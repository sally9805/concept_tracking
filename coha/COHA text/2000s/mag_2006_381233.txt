A few weeks ago , I was huddled in a hotel conference room with a dozen other neurosurgeons as we braced ourselves for the most important test of our lives . We were in Houston . It was hot and muggy . We were anxious , and all of us were sweating before the test even started . After finishing college , four years of medical school , seven years of training and five years of practice , I was taking a test that would transform me from " board eligible " to " board certified . " But only if I passed . <P> Dr. Julian Hoff , my longtime mentor , told me this would be one of the most indelible experiences of my life . As usual , he was right . I started the half-day process sitting across a table from two examiners , both senior neurosurgeons . Laid out on the tabletop between us were models of a skull , a head and a spine , as well as several laptop computers filled with brain-scan images . After a quick handshake , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid-fire sequence . A 45-year-old woman with persistent headaches . A 60-year-old man with unrelenting facial pain . A three-year-old child who has never been able to walk . We had to study the data , ask the right questions and make on-the-spot diagnoses . Our interlocutors had finely tuned poker faces and were instructed to give absolutely no feedback . I had no idea if they thought I was the greatest neurosurgeon who ever lived or totally out to lunch . <P> Whenever I try to explain the certification process to my friends and family , I 'm reminded that the whole thing is rather mysterious and confusing . Board certification is the method the medical establishment uses to set standards and maintain quality of care in 24 broad areas of specialty . In the U.S. the process is administered by the American Board of Medical Specialties and is strictly voluntary . You can be a licensed , practicing neurosurgeon without ever passing the boards . The big pressure to take the exams comes from insurance companies , third-party payers and hospital administrators , who are more likely to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see those certificates hanging on the office wall , of course , but a doctor who was certified many years ago and has n't renewed that certification may not be up to speed on the most recent advances . In fact , younger doctors with a few years ' practice under the belt are often the freshest . It can be instructive , however , to know if a doctor ever failed the exam  --  something that might reasonably be construed as a red flag . There are several websites , such as
