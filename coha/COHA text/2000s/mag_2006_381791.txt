The polls keep suggesting that Republicans could be in for a historic drubbing . And their usual advantage  --  competence on national security  --  is constantly being challenged by new revelations about bungling in Iraq . But top Republican officials maintain an eerie , Zen-like calm . They insist that the prospects for their congressional candidates in November 's midterms have never been as bad as advertised and are getting better by the day . Those are party operatives and political savants whose job it is to anticipate trouble . But much of the time they seem so placid , you wonder whether they know something . <P> They do . What they know is that just six days after George W. Bush won re-election in 2004 , his political machine launched a sophisticated , expensive and largely unnoticed campaign aimed at maintaining G.O.P. majorities in the House and Senate . If that campaign succeeds , it would defy history and political gravity , both of which ordain that midterm elections are bad news for a lame-duck President 's party , especially when the lame duck has low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign involves money  --  the national Republican Party is dumping at least three times as much into key states as its Democratic counterpart is  --  but money is only the start . " Panic results when you 're surprised , " says Republican National Committee ( R.N.C. ) chairman Ken Mehlman . " We 've been preparing for the toughest election in at least a decade . " <P> Thanks to aggressive redistricting in the 1990s and early 2000s , fewer than three dozen House seats are seriously in contention this election cycle , compared with more than 100 in 1994 , the year Republicans swept to power with a 54-seat pickup in the House . Then there 's what political pros call the ground game . For most of the 20th century , turning out voters on Election Day was the Democrats ' strength . They had labor unions to supply workers for campaigns , make sure their voters had time off from their jobs to go to the polls and provide rides to get them there . <P> Now , though , Democrats are the ones playing catch-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every Monday , berstrategist Karl Rove and Republican Party officials on Capitol Hill get spreadsheets tallying the numbers of voters registered , volunteers recruited , doors knocked on and phone numbers dialed for 40 House campaigns and a dozen Senate races . Over the next few weeks , the party will begin flying experienced paid and volunteer workers into states for the final push . The Senate Republicans ' campaign committee calls its agents special teams , led by marshals , all in the service of the partywide effort known as the 72-Hour Task Force because its working philosophy initially focused on the final three days before an election . <P> So Republicans hope to close the deal in tight races with a get-out-the-vote strategy that was developed in the wreckage of the 2000 presidential campaign . Bush 's team was led then , as it is now , by Rove , Bush 's political architect and now White House deputy chief of staff , and Mehlman , then White House political-affairs director . Their theory was that Bush lost 3% or 4% of his expected vote in 2000 because those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
