AT THE MUSEUM Headnote For the American Museum of Natural History 's fifth annual Young Naturalist Awards , students in grades 7 through 12 were invited to embark on an Headnote expedition that focused on a topic in biology , earth science , or astronomy and to document and analyze their observations . The winning entries ( selected from more than 700 ) are summarized below . Full-length versions are available in a catalog published by the Museum 's National Center for Science Literacy , Education , and Technology and can also be read online at **27;1132;TOOLONG /youngnaturalistawards/. // Pillbugs : Little Creatures in My Backyard , by Nancy Cheng ( Wichita High School East , Wichita , KS ; Grade 11 ) Last April , looking among the crocuses , hyacinths , and tulips in her family 's garden , Nancy Cheng noticed that the Hosta plants ( also known as plantain lilies ) were in " pitiful shreds " and were " dotted with holes , like some irregular green variety of Swiss cheese . " The Hosta had been ravaged by a swarm of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out about these tiny crustaceans , which are less than two-thirds of an inch long . When she conducted a dietary-preference experiment , Nancy observed that pillbugs make no distinction between lawn clippings and young plant shoots . She thereby figured out a way that pillbugs could harmlessly coexist with a garden 's plants . Deformed Frogs : The Big Mystery ; by John DeLeo ( W.T. Clarke Middle School , Westbury , NY ; Grade 7 ) During annual summer visits to his uncle 's house in Vermont , John DeLeo does a lot of frog hunting ( mostly leopard frogs and American toads ) in a large pool beside the Green River . " Because frogs are so sensitive to their environment , they may be good early indicators of an ecosystem going bad , " he explains . When John began finding deformed frogs , he decided to look for potential causes , coming up with the following four possibilities : chemicals , invasion by a trematode , increased ultraviolet radiation caused by ozone depletion , and predation during the tadpole stage . Investigating the Effects of Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee School , Donnellson , IA ; Grade 8 ) When Mauree Gibson began to study the minute crustaceans named Daphnia magna ( members of a group known as water fleas ) , she discovered her " new best friends . " Species of Daphnia , she learned , are everything from fish food to barometers of toxicity in wetlands . Her research revealed mysterious growths on her tiny specimens and subsequently led her to consult with parasitologists Dieter Ebert in Switzerland and Kirsten Christoffersen in Denmark . While she has n't yet figured out what the growths are , Mauree regards her work as " only the beginning . " A Beach Walk in New Mexico , by Elspeth Iralu ( Home School Program , Gallup , NM ; Grade 9 ) " Today I went to New Mexico 's seashore , " writes Elspeth Iralu of a hike in landlocked New Mexico , to an area with huge boulders made entirely of seashells . Once home , Elspeth ( who was also one of last year 's winners ) learned that the fragments she had collected were fossils from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North America were submerged in saltwater . " I was reminded that fossils are not just shells , " she notes , " but evidence of a past ecosystem that has evolved into our present ecosystem . " Alien Plant Invaders , by Katherine Jones ( Cold Spring Harbor High School , Cold Spring Harbor , NY ; Grade 11 ) Thirty-five percent of the approximately 3,200 plant species in New York State , Katherine Jones found out , are nonnatives such as garlic mustard , Japanese barberry , and kudzu , a " green leafy monster " that is almost unstoppable once it invades . Katherine made it her business to identify her own backyard 's invaders-which include three fast-growing Norway maples ( the species is from northern Europe ) that grow at the edge of her garden and range from three to twenty feet high . Removal of a Norway maple is a large task , she laments , because " the entire root system must be removed or the tree will resprout . " While Katherine has not found kudzu on the property , she keeps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turtle Basking in New York City , by Lillian Lam ( Abraham Lincoln High School , Brooklyn , NY ; Grade 9 ) " Manhattan 's own Central Park is home to a diverse ecosystem , " writes Lillian Lam , by way of introducing her urban research project on turtles , particularly their basking behavior in the park 's ( you guessed it ) Turtle Pond . Lillian 's fascination with turtles began at age nine , when she received a red  --  eared slider as a pet . For this project , she focused on eastern painted turtles . During three expeditions to the pond , Lillian painstakingly observed and recorded turtle behavior , concluding that " conducting an expedition requires perseverance and thorough observation . " Salmon Creek : A Search for the Missing Salmon , by Kristen Marini ( Maple Grove Middle School , Battle Ground , WA ; Grade 7 ) Kristen Marini wondered why salmon were disappearing from the little creek behind her house , a feeder stream of the Columbia River . So she intensively surveyed two eleven-square-yard sections of the surrounding forested ecosystem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creek-from trout and salmon to crawdads , periwinkles , and larval caddis flies ( which she describes as " little worms that glue themselves to a rock and put pebbles around themselves for protection " ) . Concluding that the area behind her house is healthy , Kristen is eager to test other localities nearby and to solve the ongoing mystery . Habitat Selection for Nest Cups of the Pacific Golden Plover ( Pluvialis fulva ) in Nome , Alaska , by Whitney Nekoba ( Waiakea High School , Hilo , HI ; Grade 10 ) Pacific golden plovers summer on the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska but winter in Hawaii . Since sixth grade , Whitney Nekoba has been observing wintering plovers near her home in Hilo , the capital of Hawaii Island . Last summer , however , she managed to talk her way into a research expedition to Nome , Alaska , with Brigham Young University biologist Phil Bruner and his wife , Andrea . Whitney was put in charge of examining the area surrounding twenty-one nest sites ( called nest cups ) on the tundra near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and calculate the percentages of vascular plants , nonvascular plants ( such as lichen and moss ) , and nonliving materials ( rocks and soil ) to determine whether the plovers are randomly or deliberately selecting where they lay their clutches of eggs , and what the evolutionary implications are . Growing Up at Espenberg : Eggstatic About Foxes , by Juliann Schamel ( West Valley High School , Fairbanks , AK ; Grade 12 ) Since she was ten , Juliann Schamel has spent every summer in northwestern Alaska 's remote Cape Espenberg ( thought to be where humans first crossed over to North America ) , helping her parents study shorebirds and waterfowl . Juliann conducted her own research on the area 's arctic and red foxes to find out the details of their diets . Now off to college , she is nostalgic about the cape , " where the very dirt is alive and wriggling , where the land and water and fire and sky come together to create a fascinatingly living world . " Emit What You Eat : An Investigation of the Link Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van Zyl ( Regiopolis Notre Dame , Kingston , Ontario ; Grade 12 ) Living in eastern Canada , Tave van Zyl is used to very cold winters , which sparked her interest in renewable sources of heat-specifically methane , or biogas . Inspired by the use of methane for heating as far back as the tenth century B.C. in Assyria , Tave designed an apparatus to metabolize cow manure and produce methane gas through anaerobic digestion . " Whoever imagined , " she writes , " how attractive this repulsive matter could eventually become ? " The Oxidation Potential of Mineral Assemblages in Rocks From New York and Washington State , by Michael Williams-Pearson ( Science Skills Center High School , Brooklyn , NY ; Grade 12 ) While on an internship in Washington State , Michael Williams  --  Pearson collected many pounds of metamorphic rocks to compare with those from New York State . The minerals found together in the coarse-grained New York rocks include quartz , muscovite , hornblende , and biotite , all of which weather slowly . Rocks from Washington State formations , Michael determined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower greenschist facies "  --  composed of fast-weathering chlorite , actinolite , albite , and calcite . His ultimate aim is " to find out about the rocks " potential use in construction engineering . " My Expedition to the Lava River Cave , by Amy Withey ( Our Lady of Perpetual Help , Scottsdale , AZ ; Grade 8 ) Interested in the phenomenon of cave formation after volcanic eruptions , Amy Withey , a budding spelunker , explored 3,280-foot-long , 675,000  --  year-old Lava River Cave , near her home in Arizona . Among her many objectives were identifying different lava types ( ripples , splashdowns , and lavasicles ) and comparing the cave 's formation with that of a limestone , or water-formed , cave . A Study of the Indigenous , Endemic , and Exotic Fungi in the Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve in Volcano , Hawaii , by Kolea Zimmerman ( Waiakea High School , Hilo , HI ; Grade 10 ) Studying a pocket of Hawaiian rainforest in the Pu'u Maka'ala ( pu'u is a hill or volcanic cone ; maka'ala means " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kolea Zimmerman tried to figure out how pristine the ecosystem was . He surveyed and sketched the reserve 's fungi and found sixteen species ( all native ) ; he also identified a variety of trees ( ' olapa , pilo , " olomea , and kolea ) , birds ( honeycreepers ) , and numerous insects . Kolea hopes that some of the fungi in his survey may become the source of new pharmaceuticals . <p>
