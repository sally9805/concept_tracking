A post-finale look at how Headnote CBS managed the PR circus that was Survivor . by Lynette Rice // FORGET PULAU TIGA AND THE AUSTRALian outback . The next Survivor series ought to be set in a really grueling , sometimes dangerous , and mystery-filled location : the CBS PR department . All summer long , the Eye 's marketing folks have had to hold a frenzied press corps at bay , while putting out media fires set by spoiler-obsessed Internet geeks , and trying to generate publicity for the series ( which would ultimately become the summer 's No. 1 show ) without letting its top-secret results leak out . In mid-July , they even had to fend off a stalker : After a Survivor press conference , an unidentified man hid behind bushes waiting for B.B. , Gretchen , Joel , Ramona , and Sonja to emerge . When the castaways jumped in their limo , he gave chase . " At one point , he was driving on the shoulder behind us , " says publicity director Colleen Sullivan , who ultimately gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who he was . I 'm not armed . I do n't know how to handle this . " Who would know how to handle the most publicized television event in history ? According to the TV industry newsletter The Myers Report , on the day of the final telecast alone , Survivor generated 540 news stories . That 's more than the May 3 , 1991 , finale of Dallas or the series enders for SeinfeLd and Cheers . " All summer we were trying to feed the media beast through photos , radio interviews , talk show and interview requests , " says senior VP of communcations Chris Ender , who intercepted at least 100 calls a day " It was an engine that needed constant fuel . " Fighting them every step of the way were those Internet sites and radio stations hell-bent on revealing the million-dollar winner . People would scour stuff like an Access Hollywood clip ( featuring the merged Rattana tribe ) and the show 's opening titles ( look ! a bearded Rudy ) for clues . ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY inadvertently fed the frenzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Newsweek quoted Sean saying it was the best month of his life ( he was kicked off on day 36 ) . Even a rejected contestant slipped an early spoiler to Outside magazine : After flying to Borneo on a fact-finding mission , the also-ran ran into Joel at a hotel and figured out that he 'd gotten the boot . " Early on , we decided never to confirm or deny any speculation about the results , " says Ender . " We also allowed the press to run misinformation . It turned out to be the best thing we ever did . " Ender did , however , save what he calls a " major " publication from writing that Joel was the winner early on . " I told the writer , Dude , you 're gon na get fired " ( The story never ran . ) Meanwhile , Survivorsucks. com-the Internet site CBS loved to hate because it provided invaluable publicity for the show while attempting to ruin it-posted an e-mail speculating that Richard might be the winner because he 'd bought a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called Rich and said , What did we talk about ? No big purchases ! " recalls Ender . " He laughed and said he bought the house three years ago so his son could go to school in the same district with his biological brother . " Then MSNBC.com pointed out that Ramona had described Gretchen as a true " survivor " during her CBS Early Show appearance , thus spawning pandemonium among the mainstream press and prompting another inaccurate story : that CBS was prepared to sue Ramona for letting the rat out of the hat ( " I told her , The media latches on to everything you guys say , " says Sullivan ) . Then there was the gutsy voice analyst who-the day before the finale-told the Early Show 's Bryant Gumbel that Rudy was the victor " beyond a shadow of a doubt . " " I felt bad for him , " recalls Sullivan . " I watched it , knowing it was wrong . Somebody has to stop these people ! But , it 's like , if you want to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one ever called CBS believing that Richard was the winner-but the corporate trainer was the focus of controversy . " I 'll never forget the day I 'm in my car on the way to my office , checking my voice mail , and I get a message from a Newport , R.L , paper calling for comment that Richard Hatch has been arrested on a child abuse charge , " says Ender . " I remember my heart fell to my ankles : ' ( The charge was dropped , and Rich is now suing authorities . ) By the time a Fox affiliate in North Carolina was preparing a report on Kelly 's credit card charging spree , " our skin was so coarse with all the Survivor scandal stories that we barely noticed it , " he says . But the pressure never let up . One week before the finale , two of the castawayswhen asked what they thought of the winner-accidentally gave away Hatch 's gender during radio and TV interviews . " That 's why we went to a media blackout , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer have to protect the summer 's best-kept secret , a larger PR monster lurks around the corner-Survivor : The Australian Outback , which debuts Jan. 28 . What 's the new game plan ? First off , fewer reporters will be allowed to visit the set , and those who do get the green light will only be there during the first two weeks of production . Plus , banished castaways may have to stick around until the show 's completion ( B.B. 's early homecoming tipped off one reporter that he was among the first to be kicked off ) . And lastly , no single media outlet will land an exclusive with the final survivor ( USA Today arranged its oneon-one with the winner before the show debuted ) . One thing that probably wo n't change ? The all-consuming media madness . " Requests are coming from outlets that are now kicking themselves for not being more aggressive , " says publicity director Michelle Hooper . " No one wants to miss out on the Survivor gravy train .
