<p> SAN FRANCISCO  --  The Dell Latitude D630 laptop contains mercury , a heavy metal that can damage the human nervous system . <p> Not one of its many parts is made of recycled , post-consumer plastics or plant-based plastics . It 's packaged in a box made of largely unrecycled materials . Yet it may be the most environmentally friendly mainstream laptop on the planet . <p> That 's because it does n't contain the lead , brominated flame retardants , polyvinyl chloride and other nasty chemicals common in PCs . It 's free of glued-together parts that are nearly impossible to recycle . And it does n't gobble electricity , as many other electronics do . <p> PC and electronics makers , in their quest for the fastest , coolest and most powerful devices , have never given much thought to environmental issues , says Barbara Kyle , national coordinator of the Computer TakeBack Campaign , an advocacy group . Not surprisingly , their products are often chemical-laden , power-sucking nightmares , she says . <p> Now , for the first time , almost every major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Zeina Al-Hajj , an environmental campaigner at Greenpeace . <p> The industry is brimming with new green initiatives . Dell in June announced a plan to become " the greenest technology company , " by beefing up its recycling program and building more Earth-friendly PCs . Weeks before , rival Apple made a similar pledge to become " greener . " Panasonic has taken the lead out of its plasma TVs . Motorola made its cellphone chargers energy-efficient . Sun Microsystems has even begun posting the amount of electricity it uses in each of its office parks , by month , on the Internet . <p> Companies are motivated by customer demand as much as altruism , says Scott Martin , a marketing director at Motorola . Confidential Motorola customer surveys show a marked increase in environmental concerns , he says . ( He would n't provide specifics . ) <p> Going green is n't easy . Reducing the power usage of a product can hurt performance . Electronics recyclers often spend more on labor than they earn reselling materials . <p> " Companies use ( hazardous ) chemicals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental affairs for Toshiba . There are few good , affordable ways to make the light source behind most laptop screens and flat-panel TVs without mercury , for example . <p> As a result , manufacturers are struggling . Advocacy group Greenpeace recently released a scorecard rating the largest PC and electronics makers on their recycling , hazardous-chemical and other environmental policies . Only one , Nokia , scored an 8 out of 10 . <p> It 's still unclear whether often-costly environmental programs generate enough goodwill to be worth it . <p> " If everything else is equal , a consumer will choose to purchase a product that 's more socially responsible , " says Stewart Mitchell , chief strategy officer for Sharp Electronics . " But I 'm not going to say they 'll pay more for it . " <p> Indirect impact <p> It 's hard to judge if most shoppers do n't think about it . <p> That 's not surprising , as the environmental impact of an electronic product can be hard to see . Most older TVs contain at least 4 pounds of lead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV is tossed into a landfill , the lead can leech into groundwater . People who drink it can suffer health problems , including nerve damage . <p> Preventing that kind of indirect harm is a tough sell . " Consumers do not buy products for their greenness , " says David Thompson , environmental director for Panasonic . But Panasonic and others are still taking steps to : <p> *Reduce hazardous materials . Panasonic spent six years and $75 million developing lead-free solder to connect parts inside its electronics , says Thompson . Lead solder is hard to duplicate because it has a relatively low melting point of about 180 degrees , he says . Panasonic struggled to come up with a replacement that would n't melt every computer chip it touched . <p> The lead-free solder was a key component in Panasonic 's line of lead-free plasma TVs . Yet the initiative " has n't resonated " or sparked an uptick in sales , Thompson says . <p> PVC , a common plastic that turns toxic when burned , is also hard to replace . Among other uses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There have been alternatives , but they crack ( over time ) , " says Toshiba 's Hershberg . <p> Fire-proofing materials known as BFRs , which keep overheated circuit boards from catching fire , are another problem . Traces of the toxic chemicals have been found in tests on humans and animals . <p> As part of its " greener " campaign , Apple pledged to remove both PVC and BFRs from its products . But it 's so tough that Apple gave itself a late 2008 deadline . Dell and Toshiba say they will remove PVC and BFRs from computers by the end of 2009 . <p> Others , such as Sony , are cutting back but not making any promises . The company wants to use green products , but there are often not good alternatives available , says Doug Smith , director of corporate affairs at Sony . " Environmentalists operate on principle , not on compromise , " he says . <p> *Recycling . Motorola 's recycling program is one of the industry 's most comprehensive , says Al-Hajj . New Motorola phones come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for recycling . And the company sponsors recycling drives at U.S. schools . Yet Motorola manages to take back only about 3% of the phones it sells . <p> That 's because there 's no good recycling system in place , says Kyle of the Computer TakeBack Campaign . Countries have different recycling laws . In the USA , laws vary by state . The result is a hodgepodge of recycling efforts that are often inefficient , ineffective and confusing for consumers , she says . <p> Kyle wants manufacturers to be responsible for taking back old electronics , as Motorola does with its phones . That way , they would be motivated to design products that are easily recyclable . And consumers could easily figure out how to recycle unwanted goods . <p> Many manufacturers  --  especially those that make big , heavy products  --  disagree . It can cost $100 to mail a large TV to a recycling center , says Toshiba 's Herschberg . Once it gets there , the labor of taking it apart and the price of disposing of non-recyclable parts far exceeds the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . <p> A better approach combines recycling drives from local environmental groups , retailers and government agencies , says Smith . That reduces shipping costs and the burden on manufacturers , he says . <p> Panasonic directly recycles only a few of its products in the USA , but has sponsored more than 1,000 take-back events and collected more than 28 million pounds of unwanted electronics since 2000 . " Environmentalists are fairly glib ( when they say mandated recycling by manufacturers ) is going to solve all the design problems in the world , " says Panasonic 's Thompson . Since the average TV lasts 15 years , " Companies will continue cranking out what they 're producing now , and in 15 years , when those lead panels come back , they 'll deal with it . " <p> Toshiba is trying a hybrid program , directly recycling laptops and sponsoring take-back events in partnership with Best Buy . It 's also making products easier to recycle , recently reducing the number of screws in its TVs by 32% . <p> U.S. officials generally support this hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer take-back efforts . " We look at it as a shared responsibility , " says Matt Hale , director of the Environmental Protection Agency 's Office of Solid Waste . <p> *Energy conservation . " Companies would much rather talk about energy " than almost any other environmental topic , says Ted Smith , a senior strategist at the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition ( SVTC ) , an advocacy group . That 's because saving energy saves money , something customers love . <p> It 's not always easy . Motorola has been working on power issues for years , but it was n't until March that all of its cellphone chargers were energy-efficient . ( Earlier attempts were too expensive or charged too slowly , says Scott Martin , a Motorola product manager . ) Powerful computer servers need lots of electricity to process millions of bits of data each minute , says Dave Douglas , vice president of eco responsibility for Sun Microsystems . <p> But PC and electronics-makers are making progress . Dell launched a line of servers that , when put with cooling units , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will reduce its global energy use 20% by 2010 . Steps include new , efficient PCs and cooling systems for data centers . <p> Sun is designing every product with power in mind . Over three years , the power bill for a single server can be higher than the cost of the computer itself , Douglas says . To prove its commitment , Sun now posts the monthly energy bill for its eight major campuses online . <p> *Internal programs . Being green does n't just mean making green products . Toshiba switched its office light bulbs to low-power fluorescents and installed a system to turn them off when not in use , saving more than $75,000 a year . Sharp has a factory with a giant solar-panel system that provides about a third of its power . <p> Attendees at a Sun developer conference in May were e-mailed handouts , instead of receiving them on paper . About 100 trees were saved . Also , Sun 's manufacturing plant in Scotland has cut water usage by 70% . <p> How green thou art <p> The green tide is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PC maker , Other World Computing , is building an office building that uses environmentally friendly materials and is water- and power-efficient . NComputing in Silicon Valley specializes in PCs that can be shared , saving power . ( Each user gets a separate monitor and keyboard . ) <p> But it is increasingly difficult to say how green a manufacturer is , says Smith of SVTC . That 's because almost all of them outsource . Products " are made by subcontractors , or sub-sub-contractors , increasingly in Mexico and Asia , " he says . <p> Oversight of these subcontractors can be lax , and most manufacturers wo n't even say who their subcontractors are . Sun made a rare exception for this story , providing the names of three vendors  --  Solectron , Celestica and Flextronics  --  that all adhere to an environmental code . <p> Dell wo n't reveal who supplies its parts . But it says it began asking vendors last month for information about the environmental impact of their operations . Suppliers whose factories release lots of harmful chemicals or otherwise cause damage may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monitor , says the SVTC 's Smith . <p> Still , environmentalists say they 're cheered by PC and other electronics makers ' growing interest in their planet . " We 've seen companies making a commitment and acting on it , " says Al-Hajj . " The industry is not green , but it 's definitely greener than it was before .
