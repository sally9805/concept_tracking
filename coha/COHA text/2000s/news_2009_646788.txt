WASHINGTON  --  This is change , whether you believe in it or not . And not just pocket change . <p> Following through on many of his campaign promises , President Obama wants to spend about $3.6 trillion next year to pull the nation out of recession and begin major new initiatives in health care , energy and education . <p> All that and more is contained in a 134-page budget request for 2010 and beyond that is unprecedented in size , breathtaking in scope and sure to have a major impact on millions of Americans  --  if he can get much of it through Congress . <p> It 's a budget plan that would help the young by increasing their chances of getting a college education and the poor by providing funds for health insurance . It seeks to clean the air and reduce the USA 's dependence on foreign oil . It would cut taxes on low- and middle-income Americans while raising them , starting in 2011 , on couples who make at least $250,000 a year . <p> All this would come at a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least $500 billion , and a federal debt that would reach $23 trillion in a decade . <p> Like Ronald Reagan for Republicans 28 years ago , the new Democratic president is staking out his party 's position on spending and taxes . Whereas Reagan sought to limit government , Obama wants to expand its reach . And he 's determined to tackle the nation 's most pressing issues , despite setbacks suffered by fellow Democrats Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in similar efforts . <p> " These are extraordinary times , " Obama senior adviser David Axelrod says . " We 're not in a position to think incrementally in terms of recovery , in terms of financial stability . " <p> The most jarring difference is with the past eight years  --  a period in which George W. Bush focused on sweeping tax cuts and spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . <p> " If anyone disputes the fact that elections can make a difference , all you have to do is look at the budget , " says Thomas Mann , a political scholar at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , are " day and night . " <p> In little more than five weeks , Obama has shown he intends to think big and act quickly . He 's already agreed to spend nearly $800 billion over two years to try to jump-start the economy . He 's not only pressed Congress for the second half of a $700 billion bailout of the financial industry , he 's reserving the option for another $750 billion on top of that . <p> Rather than focus solely on the immediate economic problems , however , Obama ' s budget shows he wants to work simultaneously toward long-term goals such as overhauling the health care system and achieving energy independence . <p> " This budget is Chapter Two , " says John Podesta , former White House chief of staff under Clinton and director of Obama ' s post-election transition team . Obama " wants to do the big reforms that are going to lead to long-term , sustainable growth . " <p> It 's a lot to ask of Congress . But administration officials say there 's no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I certainly hope not , " says White House budget director Peter Orszag , who was a driving force in pushing health care to the top of the president 's agenda . <p> Some of it , no doubt , will be too much . Republicans are balking at the sight of tax and domestic-spending increases . <p> " The administration 's plan is a job killer , plain and simple , " says House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio . Adds Tony Fratto , Bush 's former deputy press secretary , " Trying to mask huge spending increases under the cloak of ' fiscal responsibility is the height of audacity . " <p> Budget watchdog groups are upset about deficits projected to drop from $1.75 trillion to $500 billion  --  but stay in that range as far as the eye can see . <p> " When you get to the point that you 're pleased to be able to achieve a half a trillion ( dollar ) deficit when the economy gets going again , you 're in rough shape , " says Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , Obama will have a much tougher time getting his budget initiatives through Congress than he did his economic stimulus package  --  and that passed the Senate with the support of just three of the chamber 's 41 Republicans . Democrats have a big majority in the House , but they lack the 60 votes in the 100-member Senate needed to cut off filibusters . <p> The message from the Obama administration Thursday was simple : This is the change a majority of voters believed in , and this is what 's needed to get the economy roaring again . <p> " I work for the American people , " Obama said . " I 'm determined to bring the change that the people voted for . " <p> Wealthy would pay more <p> Almost since 1993 , when Clinton pushed through a major deficit reduction package replete with tax increases , Washington has been avoiding any more . As a result , spending has soared past revenue , and deficits have risen . <p> Enter Obama , who 's proposing $1.4 trillion in tax increases in his budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2011 , the plan would raise taxes for those in the highest income levels  --  $250,000 for married couples and $200,000 for individuals  --  by adding 36% and 39.6% tax brackets , phasing out personal exemptions and limiting itemized deductions . It also would raise the capital gains tax rate from 15% to 20% . <p> A married couple with two children under 17 and a $500,000 income would owe about $11,300 or 9% more than under current law . A single taxpayer with no children and the same income would owe about $19,200 more , according to data from Deloitte Tax LLP . " It 's a pretty significant increase , " says Clint Stretch of Deloitte Tax , which prepared the estimates . <p> The changes represent a departure from the past eight years , when tax rates fell for all income brackets , and when the difference between the lowest and the highest narrowed . " It 's a fundamental and large shift in the tax burden , " Stretch says . <p> Obama ' s plan keeps most of Bush 's tax cuts . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama ' s economic stimulus bill , would extend through 2019 . The credit is $800 for those filing jointly and $400 for individuals . It phases out for single taxpayers with $75,000 of adjusted gross income , $150,000 for joint filers . <p> Other increases in the budget include expansions of the earned income tax credit and child tax credit for low-income Americans , an expanded saver 's tax credit and a plan to automatically enroll people in IRAs and 401(k) plans . <p> The plan offers $800 billion in tax breaks for taxpayers . A married couple with two children under 17 and household income of $35,000 would save about $1,200 , according to Deloitte Tax . <p> Republicans left no doubt where they stand on tax increases . Sen. Judd Gregg , R-N.H. , who withdrew as Obama ' s nominee for Commerce secretary , calls them " massive . " <p> Even groups aligned with Obama express concern that tax increases at the end of this recession could trigger another one  --  a situation Franklin Roosevelt faced in the 1930s . " The Great Depression was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Bill Gale of the Brookings Institution . " There 's potential to do real damage . " <p> Taking on health care <p> The most dramatic initiative in the budget is one that 's not yet fleshed out : overhauling the nation 's health care system . <p> The last major effort in 1994 fell victim to opposition from insurers and other interest groups . Obama is determined to try again by setting aside $634billion over 10 years , to be raised from tax increases on upper-income taxpayers and reductions in payments to Medicare providers . <p> " Many voices were telling the president to go slow , " says Rep. Henry Waxman , D-Calif. , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , which controls Medicaid . " He wisely ignored those voices . Health care reform will help families , businesses , and workers all struggling to pay for the constantly growing costs of health care . " <p> Unlike Clinton , Obama is n't proposing how to spend that money . He wants to reduce the number of uninsured from 46 million and reduce premiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . That 's up to negotiations with Congress . <p> Robert Moffit of the Center for Health Policy Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation likens that approach to paying the check at a restaurant before you see the menu . " It 's money first , and they 're going to provide the details later , " he says . <p> Orszag told budget watchdog groups Wednesday that a bold move toward universal health coverage would raise costs initially but eventually slow the rate of growth in health care costs . <p> That 's what Republicans and fiscal conservatives want to do  --  before overhauling the health care system . Gregg and other Republicans say Obama and Congress must find a way to address the ballooning costs of Medicare and Social Security to reduce future deficits before spending billions more on health care . <p> " Neither of those issues are taken on in this , " Gregg says . " Why are n't we doing something more constructive about this ? " <p> New energy regulations <p> Obama has emphasized the need to address global warming . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of revenue includes $646 billion that would be raised over the next decade by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases , the pollutants linked to global warming . <p> Obama wants to create a " cap-and-trade " system . Congress would set a limit , or cap , on greenhouse emissions . An oil refiner , for example , would have to buy enough pollution permits from the government to account for its emissions . The $646 billion in Obama ' s budget would come from the sale of permits . <p> Its inclusion is " a clear indication of the priorities of the White House , " says Tim Profeta of Duke University 's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions . But " there 's still a political challenge to getting climate-change legislation passed . ... Hard tradeoffs need to be made . " <p> That energy provision says less about Obama ' s interest in reducing global warming and more about his interest in raising federal revenue , says William Kovacs of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . " It 's essentially a $63-billion-a-year tax on energy to fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote cleaner forms is scattered throughout the budget , from $250 million for biofuels and wind energy to $50 million for renewable energy projects on property managed by the Interior Department . <p> Environmentalists are delighted . Obama " has put us squarely on the path toward a clean energy future , " says Carl Pope of the Sierra Club . <p> Boosting access to college <p> Obama ' s third major initiative is in education , an area most often left to the states . His plan to make college more affordable represents a break from Bush , who focused most of his energy on improving K-12 education with his signature " No Child Left Behind " law . <p> " We 've never really seen a president of either party make such a strong commitment to investing in the nation 's workforce , " says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education , a lobbying group for college presidents . <p> Obama would save $4 billion a year by ending a longstanding government-subsidized college loan program , in the process beefing up a direct loan program created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government the only source of federally supported college loans . <p> The program , known as the Federal Family Education Loan ( FFEL ) program , dwarfed the direct loan program last year , loaning $56 billion to about 6 million students as opposed to $14 billion to 1.5 million students . Student loan providers say the proposal threatens what has been a dependable source of education funding . It comes at a time when many students are making their financial aid decisions for the next academic year . <p> Kevin Bruns of America 's Student Loan Providers says families can continue to rely on the federal loans . " This is n't happening tomorrow , " he notes . Even so , concerns about exactly how long these loans will be around dragged down the stock of Sallie Mae , the largest provider of FFEL loans . <p> Obama would increase the maximum Pell Grant for low-income college students to $5,550 a year , making it part of the government 's mandatory annual budget . The move would protect it from future political and budgetary pressures . It also would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saving money on defense <p> One area that 's not benefiting from Obama ' s new spending is defense . In fact , because the war in Iraq is winding down , he will save money there to use for other programs or deficit reduction . Spending for the war on terror would fall from a peak of $183 billion in 2008 to $130 billion next year . <p> Today , Obama outlines his plan to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq by August of next year . The president , who pledged to pull out combat troops in 2010 , will speak at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina . Obama also has ordered the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan to help battle a resurgent Taliban . The administration hopes to complete a review of the Afghanistan situation by early April . <p> Overall , the proposed defense budget is $534 billion , a 4% increase from the Bush administration 's last budget . That includes more members of the Army and Marine Corps . <p> Even so , Robert Work of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy would drop from 4.5% to 3.1% by 2019 . <p> " Defense is less of a burden , " he says . Work warns that without more money , weapons purchases and military construction " will be under tremendous pressure .
