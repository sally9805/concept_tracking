Darby McCormick grabbed Melanie by the arm and pulled her into the woods with no trails . Nobody came out this way . The real attraction was behind them , across Route 86 , the biking and hiking trails along Salmon Brook Pond . " Why are you taking me out here ? " Melanie asked . " I told you , " Darby said . " It 's a surprise . " " Do n't worry , " Stacey Stephens said . " We 'll have you back at the convent in no time . " Twenty minutes later , Darby dropped her backpack on the spot where she and Stacey often came to hang out and smoke  --  a sloping wall of dirt littered with empty beer cans and cigarette butts . Not wanting to ruin her new pair of Calvin Klein jeans , Darby tested the ground to make sure it was dry before sitting down . Stacey , of course , just plunked her butt right down in the dirt . There was something inherently grubby about Stacey , with her heavy mascara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nothing was ever quite able to mask the sense of desperation that hovered around her like Pig-Pen 's dirt cloud . Darby had known Melanie since , well , since forever , really , the two of them having grown up on the same street . And while Darby could recall all the events and stories she had shared with Mel , she could n't for the life of her remember how she had met Stacey , or how the three of them had become such good friends . It was as if Stacey hadsuddenly appeared one day . She was with them all the time during study hall , at football games and parties . Stacey was fun . She told dirty jokes and knew the popular kids and had gone as far as third base , whereas Mel was a lot like the Hummel figurines Darby 's mother collected  --  precious , fragile things that needed to be stored in a safe place . Darby unzipped her backpack and handed out the beers . " What are you doing ? " Mel asked . " Introducing you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charms on her bracelet . She always did that when she was nervous or scared . " Come on , Mel , take it . He wo n't bite . " " No , I mean , why are you doing this ? " " To celebrate your birthday , dumbass , " Stacey said , cracking open her beer . " And for getting your license , " Darby said . " Now we have someone to take us to the mall . " " Wo n't your dad notice these cans are missing ? " Mel asked Stacey . " He has six cases in the downstairs fridge , he wo n't miss six lousy beers . " Stacey lit a cigarette and tossed the pack to Darby . " But if he and my mom came home and caught us drinking , I would n't be able to sit or see straight for a week . " Darby held up her can . " Happy Birthday , Mel  --  and congratulations . " Stacey drained half her beer . Darby took a long sip . Melanie sniffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasting it . " It tastes like soggy toast , " Mel said . " Keep drinking , it will taste better  --  and you 'll feel better too . " Stacey pointed to what looked like a Mercedes snaking its way up Route 86 . " I 'm going to be driving one of those someday , " she said . " I can totally see you as a chauffeur , " Darby said . Stacey shot Darby the finger . " No , shitbird , somebody 's going to be driving me around in one of those ' cause I 'm going to marry a rich guy . " " I hate to be the one to break this to you , " Darby said , " but there are no rich guys in Belham . " " That 's why I 'm going to New York City . And the man I marry is not only going to be drop-dead gorgeous , he 's going to treat me right . I 'm talking dinners at nice restaurants , nice clothes , any kind of car I want  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly us to our fabulous beach house in the Caribbean . What about you , Mel ? What kind of guy are you going to marry ? Or is your heart still set on being a nun ? " " I 'm not going to become a nun , " Mel said and , as if to prove her point , took a long sip . " Does that mean you finally gave up the goods to Michael Anka ? " Darby nearly choked on her beer . " You 've been making out with Booger Boy ? " " He stopped that back in the third grade , " Mel said . " He does n't , you know , pick it anymore . " " Lucky for you , " Darby said , and Stacey howled with laughter . " Come on , " Mel said . " He 's nice . " " Of course he 's nice , " Stacey said . " Every guy acts nice in the beginning . Once he gets what he wants from you , he 'll treat you like yesterday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darby said , thinking about her father  --  Big Red , they used to call him , just like the gum . When her father was alive , he always held open the door for her mother . On Friday nights , her parents would come home from dinner and Big Red would put on one of his Frank Sinatra records and sometimes dance with her mother , check to cheek , as he sang about how those were the days . " Trust me , Mel , it 's all an act , " Stacey said . " That 's why you 've got to stop being so mousy . You keep acting that way , they 'll take advantage of you every time , trust me . " Then Stacey started in on another one of her lectures about boys and all the sneaky things they did to trick you into giving them what they wanted . Darby rolled her eyes , leaned back against a tree and looked off in the distance at the big , glowing neon cross overlooking Route 1 . As Darby drank her beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route 1 and thought about the people inside those cars , interesting people with interesting lives off to do interesting things in interesting places . How did you become interesting ? Was it something you were born with , like your hair color or your height ? Or did God decide for you ? Maybe God chose who was interesting and who was n't , and you just had to learn to live with whatever you were handed . But the more Darby drank , the stronger and clearer that inner voice of hers grew , the one that told her , with some sense of authority , that she , Darby Alexandra McCormick , was destined for bigger things  --  maybe not the life of a movie star but something definitely better and a whole lot bigger than her mother 's Palmolive world of cleaning , cooking and cutting coupons . Sheila McCormick 's biggest thrill was the greedy hunt for bargains on the clearance racks . " You hear that ? " Stacey whispered . Snap-snap-snap  --  the sound of dry twigs and branches being crunched by footsteps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darby whispered . " Not the branches , " Stacey said . " The crying . " Darby put her beer down and poked her head up over the slope . The sun had gone down a while ago ; she saw nothing but the faint outline of tree trunks . The dry , snapping sound grew louder . Was someone really out there ? The snapping and cracking sounds stopped , and then they all heard the woman 's voice , faint but clear : " Please let me go , I swear to God I wo n't tell anyone what you did . "
