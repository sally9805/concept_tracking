<p> The joys of hate may finally return to the Redskins-Cowboys rivalry today at FedEx Field . It 's about time . If Washington can sweep this season series from Dallas for the first time in a decade , and the second time since ' 87 , it will take a vital step toward reigniting the mutual loathing between these two old foes that so many relished for years and have longed to restore . <p> If Joe Gibbs can beat his old nemesis Bill Parcells back-to-back , home-and-away , my-place , your-place , or anyplace , then the long-dormant blood feud between Washington and Dallas that was once the envy of the NFL will burst back into beautiful flames . Of course , if the Redskins lose , then the Cowboys will simply say , " We 've licked ' em 15 of the last 17 . What rivalry ? " <p> From 1971 , when George Allen came to town , until 1992 , when Gibbs left after 12 seasons , Washington and Dallas established one of the great grudge matches in all of sports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  --  as long as Roger Staubach , Danny White or Troy Aikman was being dragged behind it . <p> Civilization needs incivility as a release valve , as long as it 's channeled and controlled . For 22 seasons , Redskins-Cowboys games were a model  --  short on drunken brawls in the stands , long on amazing last-second games . Thus , the nation 's capital had the perfect way to vent frustrations and defuse partisan animosity . Instead of pitting parties or classes against each other , Washingtonians joined arms in despising the Cowboys . And it worked . Communism fell . Oh , sure , probably just a coincidence . <p> The Cowboys were the team America loved , but which Washington hated with a burgundy passion . With the whole country supposedly rooting against them , the Redskins licked the ' Boys as often as not . Allen went 7-8 against Tom Landry , including a victory with a trip to the Super Bowl at stake . A decade later , Gibbs also beat Landry for a visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas under Landry ( eight years ) and Jimmy Johnson ( four seasons ) . <p> Then , as soon as Joe left town , the whole wonderful hate-fest went to Hades . The Redskins ' inability to compete with the Cowboys , even in seasons when they were lousy , was merely part of a larger problem . Washington 's annual battles with the Giants and Eagles , games that for decades stirred up fans almost as much as a Cowboys confrontation , also lost their sizzle . For the past 13 seasons , the Redskins have been the patsies of the NFC East . They do n't admit it , even to themselves . But it 's fact . <p> Since 1992 , the Redskins are 6-18 against Dallas , including a 1-14 streak that was finally interrupted two months ago by a 14-13 comeback victory in Dallas that bordered on the miraculous . Not only did the Redskins ' duels with the Cowboys disintegrate , but their battles with the Giants and Eagles also deteriorated into mismatches . In the same time frame , the Redskins were 7-18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that razor-thin 36-0 defeat in New York seven weeks ago ) . <p> Throughout this ordeal , the Redskins persevered like the indefatigable , yet totally deluded Black Knight in " Monty Python and the Holy Grail , " who has his arms and legs chopped off yet thinks he 's still winning the fight . Every year , the Redskins keep repeating , " ' T is but a scratch , " " I 've had worse , " " Just a flesh wound " and , at season 's end , " Oh , all right . We 'll call it a draw . " <p> Now , in the final three weeks of this season , the Redskins have a chance  --  a chance , mind you , not a probability  --  of starting the process of reversing these longstanding and humiliating trends within their division . The Redskins-Cowboys match is a tossup . The two teams are virtually tied in offense and defensive ranking  --  separated by 1.9 yards per game in each category , the Cowboys a hair better on offense , the Redskins on defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense may make the difference . Against intense pressure , the Cowboys ' offense tends to cope at home but crumble on the road . In its past 10 games , Dallas has averaged 25.3 points at home , but 13.5 on the road , where it is 1-3 with just a one-point win . <p> The following week , the Giants should be a clear favorite over the Redskins at FedEx . Redskins fans may assume that New York with Eli Manning blossoming at quarterback is n't really that much better this season . Sorry , the Giants are . In Drew Bledsoe and Mark Brunell , the Cowboys and Redskins have two aging stars who used to be as good as Manning will soon become . In the season finale , Washington probably has the edge in Philadelphia against the decimated Eagles . <p> If the Redskins beat the Cowboys and Eagles , but lose to the Giants , many fans may assume , because Washington did not reach the playoffs after a 3-0 start , that their season is somehow a disappointment . Perhaps . But there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the Redskins sweeps of both Dallas and Philly in the same year . In other words , after being Black Knight victims for so long , they 'd finally be back in the NFL East mix  --  in reality , not just in their minds . <p> Since ' 88 , the Redskins have not swept the Eagles . Digest that . They 've managed the trick just once against Dallas and twice against the Giants . Three sweeps over those key rivals in 17 years . That 's pathetic . For years , every time the Redskins had a chance to establish themselves as the equal of a division rival , they regressed , usually in a hail of penalties and turnovers . Will that happen again in these final three games ? <p> Or , this season , will the Redskins step over Parcells 's Cowboys in the division pecking order and serve notice to the Eagles that , even when Donovan McNabb returns next season , those Washington games on the schedule may no longer be such an annual treat ? <p> The Cowboys , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Redskins were just amazingly lucky on Sept. 19 . In the NFL , when you trail 13-0 on the road with four minutes to play and you have n't shown an iota of offense all night , you are dead meat . Yet twice the Redskins called what amounted to a street-ball play : " Santana , go deep down the middle . Mark , throw it as far as you can . Everyone else , cross your fingers . " And twice the result  --  against a Parcells-coached team  --  was a clean catch behind the safety for untouched scoring passes of 39 and 70 yards . <p> Such things do n't happen . But when they do , they can mark turning points in the competitive relationship between teams . If the Redskins fail to beat a merely pretty good Cowboys team with 90,000 raving Redskins fans behind them and the memory of the Brunell-to-Moss game as motivation , then a very large opportunity will be squandered . <p> Since ' 92 , the Redskins have been pretending that they were n't the punching bag of the Cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that horrific 22-51-1 record ( including 3-6 since Gibbs 's return and 4-17 the last four seasons ) against their three oldest traditional division adversaries tells an entirely different and ugly tale . Year after year , as the Cowboys , Giants and Eagles march out with another victory at the Redskins ' expense , our stubborn but sawed-off Black Knights bravely but ludicrously shout , " Oh , I see . Running away , eh ? Come back here and take what 's coming to you . I 'll bite your legs off . " <p> In the next three weeks , the Redskins do n't have to run the table or make the playoffs . Though that possibility is certainly offered to them . What they must do is stay focused for three consecutive , physically demanding games regardless of playoff permutations , and prove to the foes they play six times every season that they are no longer the doormats of the NFC East .
