<p> " Are there any embarrassing gaps in your reading life ? " When asked to share their deepest , darkest secrets , these fiction writers answered with great humor and grace . <p> I have no intention <p> Of reading Pynchon . <p> But if I do , <p> I 'll report to you . <p>  --  Mary Hood , author of " How Far She Went " and " Familiar Heat " <p> Where do I begin ? I 'd have to say I feel that I am weak on " The Odyssey " and the classic Greek plays . Those are the voids I would/should try to fill . Also Dostoevski 's " The Brothers Karamozov " is on my list of one-day-to-read books . Heavy lifting , huh ? But I like a challenge . <p>  --  Marita Golden , editor of " Gumbo : An Anthology of African American Writing " and author of the forthcoming " Do n't Play in the Sun : One Woman 's Journey Through the Color Complex " <p> I have more gaps in my reading than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of my theater background , I do have regrets over not having read all the plays of Shakespeare ( though the thought of it conjures images of dreadful classroom assignments ) , and I 'm sorry that I have never been able to work my way through Cervantes ' " Don Quixote , " since I love the character . And one day , I 'd like to tackle those works of Faulkner that I 've shamelessly ignored . <p>  --  Terry Kay , author of " To Dance With the White Dog " and " The Valley of Light " <p> I 've never read Dante . And I 've never read F. Scott Fitzgerald . This does n't mean I 've never pretended to have read him , of course . <p>  --  Jim Grimsley , author of " Boulevard " and " Comfort &; Joy " <p> * I have n't read " War and Peace . " I know it 's about war and peace and assume it 's set in Russia , as it is long and they 've had a great deal of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that I have n't read it that I 've accrued about 15 used copies of it , probably to torture myself . It 's like groceries . I keep buying olive paste because I have an ambition of using it , but the jars only stare out from the pantry , causing me to feel anxious and worthless , as do all those copies of " War and Peace " in my bedroom . <p> But I did read " Anna Karenina " last year and enjoyed a sort of collateral sense of accomplishment , until I faced the truth , that a real woman would 've read " War and Peace " instead . Sometimes a panic washes over me about it . I should go get the Cliffs Notes and put an end to this . <p>  --  Kaye Gibbons , author of " Ellen Foster , " " Charms for the Easy Life " and the forthcoming " Divining Women " <p> * I went about becoming a writer the same way I would have gone about becoming a dentist . That is , methodically . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do today . I felt I needed to have at least a reasonable sense of the entire literary tradition before I made the brash attempt of adding anything to it . I studied Latin for seven years , so that acquainted me with a lot of classical authors and some medieval ones . In college I majored in English honors , basically to force myself to read " Beowulf " and " Pearl " in the original . I 've always thought being a writer demanded acquiring a body of knowledge , that it was n't unlike any profession in that regard . So I worked on it . . . . <p> There are indeed famous authors I 've never read , however . D.H . Lawrence , for instance . But you ca n't put him up with Joyce or Proust . I 've read Dante , but not well . Ditto Goethe . With the real biggies , I 've at least checked them out , spent a little time with them . I 've even read " Ferdydurke " by Witold Gombrowicz , for Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Musil . The whole damn thing ! <p> Do I remember all these books I read ? Ah , that 's another question . And the truth is that it 's impossible to read all the greats . Every time you turn around , you hear about a great Icelandic novel or an epic in Sinhalese . <p>  --  Jeffrey Eugenides , author of " Middlesex " and " The Virgin Suicides " <p> * There are books stacked around my apartment like tiny skyscrapers , but my reading habits these days have been like sampling a rich buffet . I 've tasted lots of literature this year , from Milan Kundera and Dostoevski to Gabriel Garcia Marquez , but I 'm embarrassed to say I have n't gotten around to reading Toni Morrison 's " Love . " I 'm waiting for a stretch of uninterrupted time when I 've finished my own novel to savor one of my favorite authors . I 'm looking forward to a satisfying read . <p>  --  Shay Youngblood , author of " Soul Kiss " and " Black Girl in Paris " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love French literature and I know Proust is a great writer . But every time I 've started one of his books , I 've gotten bogged down or distracted and put it aside . Everyone tells me he is a wonderful writer , and I believe it . The fault is mine . It 's embarrassing . Now I tell myself and others I 'm saving Proust for my retirement , when I will read all his work , and Thomas Mann 's " Joseph and His Brothers . " <p>  --  Robert Morgan , longtime professor at Cornell University and author of " Gap Creek " and " Brave Enemies " <p> * I have n't read any Nabokov except for " Lolita , " although I always told people I have . I pretended for years to love and understand Shakespeare , when in reality I had only read a few plays for school over the years , and only pretended to love those . <p> I have never read " War and Peace , " although I tell people I have , and have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make up for something . ( Well , at least three times . ) <p> I have told groups of people that I try to read " Middlemarch " every few years , when the fact is , I 've read it twice  --  and love it . ( You 've got to believe me . ) <p> I have never read anything all the way through by James Joyce except for " A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . " <p> I am currently telling people I have read " Life of Pi " and " Three Junes , " although I just read the early chapters of both , so you can see that my dissembling knows no dateline . <p> I could go on and on . <p> I 've never read any Willa Cather , except for " My Antonia , " although I certainly meant to . <p>  --  Anne Lamott , author of " Blue Shoe " and " Crooked Little Heart " <p> * I confess that I have n't read Proust , though I promise myself every summer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough Kafka . I continue to work my way through Chekhov 's stories and have recently gone back to Faulkner 's " As I Lay Dying " and " The Sound and the Fury . " I plan to read those two books again regularly for the rest of my life . <p>  --  Pam Durban , professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and author of " So Far Back " and " The Laughing Place " <p> * I have not read " The Catcher in the Rye . " <p> Actually , I did n't know it was such a big deal to have read it until I was old enough to resist the idea of a " canon . " It was n't assigned at my high school  --  apparently it is a book best enjoyed in one 's youth . So , in a way , I feel like I have missed the boat . From what I understand , " The Catcher in the Rye " is like the prom : If you miss it , you ca n't scrape up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a grown-up . <p> There are other books that are " important " that I have never been able to finish . For example , I have never made it to the end of " Moby Dick . " Now , this is a story that I probably should n't share because I have written more than one research paper on the subject . But frankly , the novel bored me so , that I actually cried while sitting in a coffee shop in Athens  --  two days before the research paper was due . <p> I wondered what it meant about me . Did this mean I was a fraud , a pseudo-intellectual ? Why did n't I have the stamina necessary to choke down 704 pages of tedious Melvillian genius ? I mean , Toni Morrison makes a convincing case that " Moby Dick " sort of explains American racial angst better than almost any other text . But for me , all I could think was : What a snooze . I liked the first line , " Call me Ishmael , " but after that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of " Leaving Atlanta " <p> * I decided about seven years ago that I would take summers to catch up on one writer whom I was supposed to have read but had n't at all or only glancingly . As an English teacher , you hang around so many conversations about X and Y , you can almost convince yourself you have read them . <p> My first summer , I read Dante . Then I did all of Frost . I had actually read a lot of Frost , but mostly anthology pieces , so I went through the collected poems and read Jay Parini 's great biography alongside . Oh yes , that 's something else I do . I find a good " guide " through a work , a critic who gives me some of the life and a lot of the work . <p> I read all of Chekhov 's short stories I could find . Emily Dickinson was the next summer . I had read a lot of her work , but then I went through the collected poems and alongside it read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Last summer , I read Elizabeth Bishop , and read Brett Millier 's critical study of her work alongside . <p> I do n't know who it will be this summer . . . big gaps still left ! <p>  --  Julia Alvarez , writer-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont and author of " In the Time of the Butterflies " and " How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents " <p> * Interesting question , but I do n't really think about reading that way . My biggest problem is that since I 'm a writer , there are long chunks of time when I ca n't read any fiction because I 'm working , so that when I 'm in between big projects , I read everything ! But that 's for pleasure , not to make up for any gaps . I think I 'm beyond being embarrassed by any gaps in my education . Right now , I 've got a stack that includes Doris Lessing , Maxine Hong Kingston , Nikki Giovanni , Anne Tyler , Alice Walker and Guy Johnson . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm going to be a readin ' fool ! <p>  --  Pearl Cleage , author of " Some Things I Never Thought I 'd Do " and " What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day " <p> * I 've never read a word of John Dos Passos , and I 've always meant to do so . I did n't read a word of Faulkner , outside of the short story " Dry September , " until I was 33 . And even when I sat down to muddle through everything , I could n't get past the Benjy part of " The Sound and the Fury " until after about three tries . Get this : I could figure out what went on while the idiot man-child spoke , but not when the relatively sane , rational characters chimed in . Then I read " Light in August , " " Absalom ! Absalom ! , " " As I Lay Dying , " " Go Down , Moses " pretty much in succession , though none of it seemed to stick to my writing-style ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 33 . That 's a novel I tell students to skip  --  to go watch the movie . <p> Just last summer , at age 45 , I finally read Cervantes ' " Don Quixote . " I ca n't believe it took that long for me to get to it , seeing as it 's pure satire/goofball/funny stuff that 's right up my narrow alley . <p> And finally  --  oh , this one 's embarrassing  --  I never finished Thomas Wolfe 's " Look Homeward , Angel . " And although I own a nice new paperback copy of " You Ca n't Go Home Again , " I 've never cracked the cover . <p>  --  George Singleton , teacher at the South Carolina Governor 's School for the Arts and Humanities and author of " The Half-Mammals of Dixie " <p> * I 've got lots of gaps in my reading record : George Eliot , Jane Austen , most of Balzac , much of Dickens , Willa Cather , Aldous Huxley . . . . <p> I 'm at the age 80 where I reread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ex-students . But truth to tell , mainly since retiring from teaching and editing , I read history : British and American , military , other . <p>  --  Louis D. Rubin Jr. , co-founder of Algonquin Books , longtime professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the author or editor of more than 50 books , including " The History of Southern Literature " <p> * Faulkner haunts me every summer ! I say I 'm going to read " Absalom , Absalom " and I never do . I have read some Faulkner  --  " The Sound and the Fury , " " As I Lay Dying , " lots of stories , but " Absalom " . . . I begin , and my mind wanders and then it wanders and then it wanders . " <p>  --  Jill McCorkle , professor at Bennington College in Vermont and author of " Creatures of Habit " and " Ferris Beach " <p> * I have many " regrets " or " gaps " in my reading list . Two of them are all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have read some books by both authors , but I wish I could have read many more of their titles . Both are great writers , and I will spend more time reading them in the future . <p>  --  Ha Jin , professor at Boston University and author of " Waiting " and " The Crazed " <p> * There are several gaps in my reading , but the major one is the great Russian writers , particularly Dostoevski . I read his " Notes From Underground " as an undergraduate , because it was part of the humanities syllabus . Later I started but never finished " Crime and Punishment " and " The Brothers K. " In fact , the cheap old paperback editions of these novels are still on my bookshelves , having traveled with me for many years . I went on a hunt for them this morning . They are hiding or have disintegrated . <p> Instead , I found another book I bought ( more recently ) and also postponed reading : J.M. Coetzee 's novel " The Master of Petersburg , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the taciturn Russian by way of the taciturn South African . <p>  --  Judith Ortiz Cofer , professor at the University of Georgia and author of " The Meaning of Consuelo " <p> * I 've always had a blind spot about Faulkner , and though I try one of his books every year , I never get very far into it . I 've read " Light in August " and " The Sound and the Fury " all the way through  --  those are the only ones . People are always saying , " Oh , you must try ' As I Lay Dying , ' or , ' The best one is ' The Wild Palms , ' " but those books fell from my hands . He does seem to me to be a garrulous drunk  --  exactly what Nabokov thought him to be . <p>  --  Edmund White , professor at Princeton University and author of " Fanny : A Fiction "
