If comedian AMY SEDARIS ' real face is difficult to recall , it 's probably because she does n't wear it much on TV . Instead , the pixieish actress , right , often looks like this : her character Jerri Blank from the cable cult hit , and now feature film , Strangers with Candy . " She 's so nasty ! " says Sedaris , who wiggles into a fat suit to play the ex-hooker , ex-junkie and all-around loser . Now Jerri has become the face of the new antifur campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) . " Previous ads addressed the animal cruelty behind fur , but people who still wear fur do n't seem to care about animals , " says PETA 's Dan Mathews . " So we 're playing to the insecurity of fashionistas . Thus the tag line , ' When you wear fur , people laugh at you , not with you . ' " Of course , with Jerri , they kind of do both .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
