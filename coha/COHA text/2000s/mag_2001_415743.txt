// For several years in the early 1990s U.S. intelligence maintained close ties with a Haitian named Emmanuel " Toto " Constant , the , founder of a savage paramilitary group that has been held responsible for a prolonged wave of killings and other atrocities . Toto Constant today walks the streets of Queens , a free man . How did he come to find refuge in the United States ? Who has been holding up his deportation ? No one remembers who first saw him in the neighborhood , but one day last summer Emile Maceus was nearly certain that Emmanuel " Toto " Constant-the man everyone called " the devil " - was standing on his front stoop . The man was six-foot-three , maybe more ; he wore a coat and tie , and his hair-a tightly curled Afro-was nearly combed . He had come , he said , to show a client Maceus 's house , a three-bedroom in Queen 's Village , New York . He was a real-estate agent , he said , and had seen the pink FOR SALE sign on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face was pudgier than Maceus remembered from Haiti , during the military regime of the early 1990s . Back then he had been bone-thin and ghostlike , sometimes appearing with an Uzi or with a .357 Magnum tucked under his shirt To help keep the junta in control he had terrorized the population with his paramilitary squad  --  a legendary outfit of armed civilians who , together with the Haitian military , allegedly tortured , raped , and murdered thousands of people . " Can we look around ? " the man asked . Maceus was n't sure what to do . Maybe it was n't Constant . He was bigger than Maceus recalled , more genial , and before Maceus knew it , the man was walking through his house , poking his head into each room , looking at the floorboards and the toilets , taking note of the overhead space in the kitchen , and commenting in Creole . In the living room the man passed a poster on the wall of Jean-Bertrand Aristide  --  the once and future Haitian president , and the paramilitaries ' archenemy-but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a real-estate agent after all , just another Haitian immigrant trying to survive in New York . But as the real-estate agent was leaving , Maceus kept thinking , What if he is Toto Constant ? Maceus knew that in 1994 , after the United States overthrew the military regime , Constant , a fugitive from Haitian justice , had been allowed , inexplicably , to slip into the country . Maceus had heard that after Constant had finally been arrested and ordered deported , he had in 1996 mysteriously been released under a secret agreement with the U.S. government-even though the Haitian government had formally requested his extradition and U.S. authorities had found photos of his group 's victims , their bodies mutilated , pasted to the walls of his Port-au-Prince headquarters like trophies . As the man was opening the front door , Maceus 's curiosity overcame him . He asked in Creole , " What 's your family name ? " The man hesitated . " Constant . " It was Toto Constant . For an instant the two Haitians stood there , staring at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car . Maceus went inside and found his wife . She was trembling . " How could you bring that devil in my house ? " she shouted . " How could , you ? " News of the encounter spread through the city 's sprawling Haitian community , from Flatbush to Laurelton to Cambria Heights to Brooklyn , as it would have in Haiti  --  by teledjol , word of mouth . Constant had ventured out into the community several times since the U.S. government had set him free , but never with such audacity-selling houses to the same people he had driven into exile . When he first arrived in Queens , he seemed to emerge only periodically . He was spotted , someone said , at a disco , clad in black , dancing on the day of Baron Samedi , the voodoo lord of death who guards cemetery gates in his top hat and tails . He was seen at a butcher shop and at a Blockbuster . Haitian  --  community radio and local newspapers reported the sightings- " HAITI 'S GRIM REAPER PARTYING IN U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone could locate him . Finally , in 1997 , the rumors led to a quiet street in Laurelton , Queens , near the heart of the Haitian community , where for years exiles had hoped to shed the weight of their history-a history of never-ending coups and countercoups-and where Constant could be seen sitting on the porch of the white-stucco house he shared with his aunt and mother . " The whole idea of Toto Constant living free in New York , the bastion of the Haitian diaspora , is an insult to all the Haitian people , " Ricot Dupuy , the manager of Radio Soleil d'Haiti , in Flatbush , told his listeners after Constant moved in . It was not long before residents draped the street 's trees and lampposts with pictures of Constant 's alleged victims , their hands and feet bound with white cord or their limbs severed by machetes . Neighbors shoved one of the most horrifying pictures-a photo of a young boy lying in a pool of blood-under Constant 's door . But a few days later Constant was back on his porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stoned his door . Then , last summer , after Constant 's appearance at the Maceus house , an angry crowd appeared around his home , yelling " Murderer ! " and " Assassin ! " At one point , as they were gathering , someone spotted a figure down the road-a well-known ally of Constant 's , " a spy ; " as one person cried out-and the crowd chased after him . When he disappeared and there was still no sight of Constant , the crowd marched to the real-estate office , four miles away , where it threatened to drive the Haitian owner out of business unless he fired his new employee . By last November , Haitians had created permanent Toto Watches-networks that tracked Constant 's every whereabouts . At about this time I met Ray Laforest , one of the Toto Watchers , and he agreed to show me where " the devil " could be found . He told me to meet him at Binnette 's Hair Palace , on Linden Boulevard , next to the real-estate office in front of which Constant had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look for him . The barbershop was in the center of Cambria Heights , across the street from a Haitian restaurant and next to a Haitian grocer . It was a small , cramped space , with a TV in the corner . Customers sat in old chrome seats with their heads tilted back , while barbers in white smocks trimmed their hair . As I waited for Laforest , one of the barbers , a young man with a gold chain around his neck , looked at me suspiciously . I explained that I was doing a story on Toto Constant . He said that Constant was a " vampire , " someone who sucked the life out of people . An older barber , who had been working at his chair on the opposite side of the room , walked over to a closet and pulled out a shovel . It was long , with a thick metal handle , and in a bit of showmanship he lifted it in the air like a club . " This is what they do to the devil people " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few minutes later Laforest walked in . He was a large man , with a beard and sunglasses . He carried with him several Wanted posters of Constant , one of which he unfurled , revealing an old black-and-white photograph of the reputed death-squad leader . A moustache curled down around the corners of his mouth , and several crooked teeth showed between his lips . In bold letters the poster said WANTED : EMMANUEL " TOTO " CONSTANT FOR CRIMES AGAINST THE HAITIAN PEOPLE . As we walked outside , Laforest told me that Constant had disappeared since the protest . " He 's gone into hiding again , " he said . We got in his car and drove through the neighborhood , past a series of elegant Tudor houses , until we arrived at the house where Constant had last been seen . " Why are you stopping ? " I asked . " I 'm numb , " he said . " If I saw him right now , I 'd tie him up myself . " He told me that Constant 's men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church and shot him in broad daylight , and that earlier his own brother had been tortured by the Haitian military . We waited for several minutes , parked behind a bush . " Bay kou bliye , pote mak sonje , " Laforest said . " What does that mean ? " I asked . " It 's an old Creole proverb , " he said . " Those who give the blows forget , those who bear the scars remember . " LETTING TOTO SPEAK FOR TOTO I had been looking for Constant ever since I heard that a man facing charges in Haiti for crimes against humanity was living among the very people against whom the crimes were said to have been committed . Unlike Cain , who was cast out of his community , Constant had become an exile in a community of exiles , banished among those whom he had banished . Though he had fled justice , he could not fully escape his past . He had to face it nearly every day-in a glance from a neighbor , or a poster on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , confronted with the prospect of real justice . Last fall the Haitian government put him on trial in absentia for the murder of at least six people in the town of Raboteau in April of 1994 . Dozens of others were also on trial . It was a historic case-the first major attempt by the Haitian government to prosecute Haitians ( or anyone else ) for the brutal crimes committed by the military regime and to test its judicial system , which had been corrupt for so long that it was essentially nonexistent . As a result there was growing pressure on the U.S. government , from home and abroad , to extradite him , and Constant , once intoxicated by press attention , gave fewer and fewer interviews . Since the protest outside his house he had apparently vanished . // When I reached his lawyer , J. D. Larosiliere , last October , be told me that things were at their most critical juncture . A barrel-chested Haitian-American who speaks a combination of formal English and street slang and has a penchant for finely tailored suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Haitian version of Johnnie Cochran . " Denying that there had even been a massacre at Raboteau , he said that if Constant were sent back to Haiti , he would never receive a fair trial and would likely be assassinated . Because of the desperateness of the situation , Larosiliere agreed to let Constant talk to me at length about his current predicament and the allegations against him . " All we want to do is get his side of the story out " Larosiliere said . So , one afternoon several days later I headed to Larosiliere 's office , in Newark , New Jersey . When I arrived , Constant and Larosiliere were in a closed-door meeting , and I waited outside in the foyer . I could hear the sound of Creole punctured by occasional bursts of English . A moment later the door swung open , and a large man in a double-breasted suit hurried out . It took me a moment to recognize Constant-he looked at least thirty pounds heavier than in the pictures I 'd seen of him taken during the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his heavier face it no longer looked so menacing . He wore a turtleneck under his jacket and , to my surprise , a gold earring in his left ear . " Hey , how you doing ? " he said , speaking with only a slight accent . I had expected many things , but not this : he looked like an average American . We sat down in a small conference room lined with books . He leaned forward and then back , and I took out my tape recorder and laid it on the table . Finally he said , " It 's time for Toto to speak for Toto " It was the first of more than a dozen interviews . As he told me his story over the next several months , he often spoke for hours on end . He turned over his voluminous notes and private papers , his correspondence and journals . During that time I also interviewed his alleged victims , along with human-rights workers , United Nations observers , Haitian authorities , former and current U.S. officials within the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service , and the intelligence community , many of whom had never before spoken publicly about Constant . I also gained access to intelligence reports , some of which had previously been classified , and State Department cables . With these and other sources I was finally able to piece together not only the story of Emmanuel " Toto " Constant but also much of the story of how the United States government secretly aided him and later shielded him from justice . VOODOO PARAMILITARY In October of 1993 the USS Harlan County , loaded with military personnel , was sent steaming toward Haiti 's capital , Port-au-Prince . President Bill Clinton had dispatched the ship and its crew as the first major contingent of an international peacekeeping mission to restore to power Haiti 's first democratically elected President , Jean-Bertrand Aristide . Aristide was a political priest a wiry , passionate , bug-eyed orator who had risen to power in late 1990 on a mixture of socialism and liberation theology . The downtrodden of Haiti , which is nearly everyone , called him " Titid " and revered him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstable radical . He was deposed in a coup less than a year after taking office and ultimately fled to the United States . Since then the military , along with roaming bands of paramilitaries , had murdered scores of people . The bloodshed had galvanized the international community , and the ship 's arrival was hailed as a turning point in the effort to restore both some semblance of public safety and the island 's democracy . On October 11 , as the Harlan County neared port , a group of UN and U.S. officials , headed by the charge d'affaires , Vicki Huddleston , and accompanied by a large press corps , came to formally welcome the ship and its troops . The assembly waited at the entrance to the port for a guard to open the gate , but nothing happened . Documentary footage shows Huddleston sitting in the back of her car with the CIA station chief . Speaking to another embassy official , she says into her walkie-talkie , " Tell the captain of the port I am here to speak with him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and we are getting nowhere . " " Well , tell him I 'm here at the gate and Fm waiting for the authorities to open it . " " He does n't want to talk right now ... He ran away . " " Open the gate . " " We 're having some problem with hostile staff We may have a situation . " Indeed , at that moment a band of armed men , under the direction of the then little-known thirty-six-year-old paramilitary leader Toto Constant , stormed the area . The men , who had already blocked the dock where the Harlan County was supposed to tie up , surrounded Huddleston 's car , banging on the hood and yelling in English , " Kill whites ! Kill whites ! " There were only about a hundred in all , many of them pot-bellied and out of shape ; although some carried guns , many wielded sticks and pitchforks . But the show of force , just a few days after U.S. soldiers had been killed in Somalia , proved terrifying . Constant put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops banged on sheepskin drums and shouted " Somalia " as if it were a battle cry . They drank and caroused through the night , turning their vehicles ' lights toward the open sea where the Harlan County was still waiting . Finally President Clinton ordered the ship to leave . It was one of the most humiliating retreats in U.S. naval history , and a surprising one even to those who forced it . " My people kept wanting to run away , " Constant told reporters afterward . " But I took the gamble and urged them to stay . Then the Americans pulled out ! We were astonished . " That day was the coming-out party for Constant and his Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti , better known as FRAPH , which in Creole evokes the word " trapper , " meaning " to hit . " ( Constant said the name had come to him in a dream . ) Organized by Constant several months earlier , FRAPH was described by its leader as a grassroots political organization- " a mysterious event " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aristide 's populist movement . The party literature , which Constant composed on an old manual typewriter and handed out to the press , explained that " FRAPH is a popular movement of unity , where all the social sectors are firmly intertwined to bring perfect harmony to the Haitian people . " But FRAPH was a peculiar sort of political party : although it offered free food and liquor to lure supporters , most of its thousands of followers were drawn from the armed bands that operated at the military 's behest and from former members of the now defunct Tonton Macoutes , the infamous paramilitary organization named for a child-snatching bogeyman in Haitian fairy tales . At rallies FRAPH members demonstrated mass salutes that seemed designed to evoke fear : at Constant 's cue his followers would raise their left bands over their heads and slam their right fists into them , or raise their right hands in the air , palms forward , in Nazi fashion . And although FRAPH 's literature spoke of unity , Constant declared publicly , " If Aristide were to return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of this country . " In this setting Constant tried to cultivate an image as the only gentleman in a band of thugs . At the official launching of FRAPH , as his men surrounded him with guns , he released a handful of doves . Rather than don a soft hat and sunglasses , or camouflage pants , like other paramilitaries , he often appeared in a neat blue suit and tie . He sometimes carried a bamboo cane in his right hand , which he leaned on as he walked . He was well suited for the part of the gentleman . He had been raised within Haiti 's tiny aristocracy , and had studied at Canadian universities and worked briefly in New York as a Haitian diplomat . He spoke English with only a slight accent , and translated for the press in Spanish , French , and , of course , Creole . " Never forget that I am from the establishment , " he liked to say . " I am not just any Joe out there . I 'm Constant . " Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set deep in his head , were glassy and jittery . U.S. officials and reporters said that he was wired on cocaine ( Constant has always denied this ) , and be was known to stay up all night , driving wildly through the streets , his bodyguards hanging out the back of the car with their machine guns . In public he usually appeared with a man named Jojo , a fierce former Macoute who claimed that his pregnant wife had been murdered by Aristide 's supporters and who was regarded as a merciless killer . " He is not afraid of anything " Constant still says of Jojo respectfully . Throughout the summer and fall of 1993 , with Jojo as his partner , Constant began a campaign to set up FRAPH offices in every town and village . Members received special ID cards and , apparently with the military 's approval , machine guns . Like the old Macoutes , they operated as part local bosses , part spies , part extortionists , part militia , and part political cadre . But at their core they were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force multiplier , " as one U.S. intelligence report put it , which would allow the regime the deniability that a prudent government always looks for in the use of murder . " FRAPH 's will is an order ; " Constant declared shortly after the storming of the port . " When we ask for something , the entire country has to accept it . " " FACIAL SCAlPING " More and more packs of armed men began to roam at night , looking for Aristide supporters . They were be believed to be FRAP , the police , or the military , or a combination of all three , but they were usually careful to disguise themselves with hoods or women 's clothing ( a trademark of the old Macoutes ) . They carried tire irons , M-16s , Uzis , pistols , machetes , axes , and " voodoo powders , " which were widely believed to be lethal . They broke into homes and seized their political enemies . " I realized that I was among animals , " an Aristide supporter who was taken prisoner by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first they played with me , taking out their guns and saying I would die . Then they took me to a little torture chamber where there was a small bed ... They started beating me about the buttocks with their truncheons , one after the other . At that moment I thought I would die . I passed out . When I came to , I was in a cell with another man . There were rivers of blood on the floor . Some of it was mine . " Photograph The USS Harlan County off the coast of Haiti , 1993 // " The scenario is always substantially the same , " the OAS/UN International Civilian Mission reported in 1994 , after an extensive investigation . " Armed men , often military or FRAPH members , burst into the house of a political activist they sought to capture . " If he was n't there , the report said , the intruders attacked his wife or sister or daughter . " One guy took me by the hands and led me to the front porch , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . He said , " If you do n't I 'll split your head open ' ... He pulled his pants down to his knees , lifted up my nightgown , pulled down my underpants , and raped me . " Faceless bodies began to appear in the streets . The assailants had developed a kind of art known as " facial scalping , " a bloody ritual in which a person 's face was peeled from ear to ear with a machete . It was a way to torture people even in the afterlife , because , many believed , such mutilation would prevent a proper burial-trapping the spirit eternally in purgatory . As the bodies piled up , Constant held forth . He would often sit in a rattan chair in the courtyard of the house that had been his father 's , a sprawling Art Deco mansion with a swimming pool and fountains , and speak to the press . Unlike other paramilitary leaders , who purposely remained in the shadows , Constant craved coverage . He let reporters sleep in his garden . He cut back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out T-shirts emblazoned with FRAPH 's name . " I had one-on-ones with the greatest reporters in the world , " he recalls today . " All of them . I 've met all of them . At one point I was the most interviewed person in the world . I was one of the most important . I had Japanese journalists at my place . It was incredible " Constant enjoyed playing the role of statesman . He warned the United States not to intervene and threatened to shut down the country in protest of the world embargo put into place after the coup . He called for the dissolution of Haiti 's parliament , echoing Jojo , who had earlier warned that if it did n't disband , FRAPH would call on the people to " tie up the deputies . " What I say comes from my heart , " Constant would say . Or " A leader has to know how to play with the army , the power , and the people . " As he cultivated the press , Constant also courted Haiti 's houngans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He portrayed himself as an embodiment of the most  --  ferocious spirits . He held public ceremonies in front of the markets or at temples , where his men laid out small skulls . At a typical ceremony he would lie on the ground , surrounded by skulls and fire . Then , as he rose from the flames , the crowd would chant in Creole , " Toto for President ! Without Toto , Haiti ca n't have a life . ' Though he still carried a .357 Magnum , he insisted that he no longer needed it . " I have the power of voodoo with me : ' he said . GENERAL CONSTANT 'S BOY In Haiti nearly every leader has a hidden history , a family closet usually filled with the bones of enemies . Constant inherited the secrets , and to some degree the power , of his father . Gerard Emmanuel Constant had been the army chief of staff under Haiti 's dictator Francois " Papa Doc " Duvalier during the 1960s , a loyal soldier who once famously rose from his bed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , more than a dozen of his friends at the dictator 's command . He remained a symbol of the old ruling order after it had collapsed . But shortly after the military coup , in September of 1991 , as his disciples emerged from the barracks to restore the old Duvalier system , the seventy-two-year-old general slipped into a coma and died . All the military leaders and former Duvalier supporters turned out for the old general 's funeral . " It was a real phenomenon : " Constant says . " I was inheriting all my father 's protection and power and people . It was a symbolic transference . ' In his private papers Constant went even further : " My prominence , some might argue , is destiny ... To be the first son of General Gerard Emmanuel Constant is the call to arms for Emmanuel Gerard Constant , myself . " It was not long before people feared the younger Constant even more than they had feared his father . By the middle of 1994 thousands of Haitians had been slaughtered or had disappeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed by FRAPH itself ( most human-rights observers had by then been driven out of the country ) , the group was universally considered the most brutal of all the right-wing paramilitary outfits . Witnesses , many of them found floating on rafts as they tried to escape to the United States , told international authorities that Constant 's men , in an effort to wipe out opposition , were annihilating the population . Even FRAPH members started to flee in disgust . " When they kill and rape people , we new members are forced to sit and watch ; ' a former recruit told U.S. authorities , according to a declassified document obtained by the Center for Constitutional Rights for use in a lawsuit against FRAPH . Later , as part of their initiation , this same man said , the recruits were made to join the assaults . Photograph Emmanuel " Toto " Constant at a FRAPH rally , 1994 // Though Constant continued to deny the allegations , the UN concluded by 1994 that Constant 's organization was " the only political movement in Haiti whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the spring of 1994 a secret cable from the office of the American military attache in Port-au-Prince warned , " All over the country , FRAPH is evolving into a sort of Mafia . ' Its members were " gun-carrying crazies , " one cable stated , eager to " use violence against all who oppose it . " According to witnesses , when a FRAPH member turned up dead in Cite Soleil , a sprawling slum in Port-au-Prince , in December of 1993 , Constant 's men descended within hours . Carrying machine guns and machetes , they torched a thousand houses in revenge , killing more than a dozen people . Here is an excerpt from the account by Human Rights Watch/Americas-NCHR : They entered the neighborhood , looked for specific persons and shot them on sight , doused the precarious one-room shacks with gasoline , set them alight , and fired their weapons into the air as the flames spread ... During the fire , known FRAPH members beat and arrested several people under the eyes of the military ... The Justice and Peace Commission reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors shut , imprisoning people in their homes . Constant , as usual , denied FRAPH 's involvement . As he later pointed out , " If I was going to really react , there would be no more Cite . " Though there were reports that he was on the scene during the fire and at other times had participated personally in torture sessions , Constant was careful to avoid serious implication . But the more Constant appeared on television to deny any connection with crimes , the more he seemed the face of them . By the autumn of 1994 he was no longer merely the head of FRAPH ; he had become , in the eyes of most Haitians , the embodiment of the regime : the voodoo lord of death , Baron Samedi , himself . A MYSTERIOUS ESCAPE In July of 1992 Brian Latell , the leading CIA . analyst for Latin America , visited Haiti to gather intelligence as policymakers in Washington tried to assess military rule in Haiti . Afterward , in a report later obtained by the press , he wrote , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intimidating and occasionally terrorizing real and suspected opponents , but my experiences confirm the intelligence community 's view that there is no systematic or frequent lethal violence aimed at civilians . " Playing down the bloodshed ( Latell called the head of the junta , Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras , " a conscientious military leader " ) , the report directly conflicted with those coming from human-rights organizations , the press , and even the State Department . But along with subsequent CIA reports , it contributed to the ongoing vacillation in Washington . Whereas President Bill Clinton was pushing to restore the exiled Aristide to power , many in the CIA , along with elements in the Pentagon , feared that Aristide was a dangerous populist . In fact , Aristide was a problematic figure for the United States ( he had once suggested necklacing his enemies with burning tires ) . But a crucial CIA report , which was circulated on Capitol Hill just after the Harlan County incident , seemed to grossly exaggerate his instability , claiming that he was so unbalanced psychologically that he had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be false , but at the time , it fueled American opposition to an invasion . " There were factions in the process who did n't want to get involved in Haiti and could use these intelligence reports to strengthen their position , " one former Clinton Administration official says . But the evidence of " systematic " and " frequent lethal violence aimed at civilians " was overwhelming . And finally , in September of 1994 , three years after the coup and almost a year after the Harlan County 's retreat , President Clinton ordered a full-scale invasion to end what he called the " reign of terror . " " We now know that there have been ... over three thousand political murders , " he said . In preparation for battle Constant changed FR " H 's name to the Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People and , according to news accounts , stockpiled weapons and " secret " powders that , he declared , would be able to " contaminate water so that the GIs will die . ' He claimed to have one powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camouflage pants and a black T-shirt , a machine gun at his side , he no longer gave any hint of the diplomat . " Each FRAPH man , " Constant said , " must put down one American soldier . " But faced with the might of the United States , the junta agreed to step down . Incredibly , after thousands of U.S. soldiers seized the island , many of them countenanced FRAPH 's activities as expedient for maintaining order . When asked why , U.S. soldiers said they had been told by their superior officers that FRAPH was a legitimate opposition party , like Republicans and Democrats . U.S. soldiers even stood by , insisting they were not a local police force , while FRAPH members beat back civilians who had spilled onto the streets expecting liberation . It was only after random bands of FRAPH members mowed down a crowd of Haitians and shot and wounded an American photographer , and a radio conversation was intercepted in which Constant and his men threatened to " break out weapons " and " begin an allout war against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On October 3 they stormed FRAPH headquarters . A jubilant crowd gathered outside , cheering them on . Inside , amid piles of nail-embedded sticks , Molotov cocktails , trophy photos of mutilated corpses , and thousands of secret documents , soldiers surrounded more than two dozen FRAPH members . They bound their hands and gagged them , while the crowd screamed , " Let them die ! Let them die ! " As the soldiers departed with their FRAPH prisoners , the crowd rushed inside , smashing the headquarters . Photograph One of the daily victims , Port-au-Prince , 1994 // Back at his father 's mansion , Constant listened to a police scanner , waiting for the soldiers to seize him . His wife and children had already fled . At one point , while he was holed up , according to the Chicago Tribune , he yelled at a journalist , " Everybody who is reporting the situation bad ... by the grace of God , they will wind up in the ground ! " But even as other FRAPH members were taken into custody , Constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to everyone 's amazement , the U.S. embassy spokesman , Stanley Schrager , whose assassination Constant had called for only two days before , arranged a press conference for him outside the presidential palace . News footage shows Constant standing under the glaring sun , sweating in a jacket and tie . " The only solution for Haiti now is the reality of the return of Aristide ; ' he said . " Put down your stones , put down your tires , no more violence . " As he spoke , hundreds of angry Haitians pushed against a barricade of U.S. soldiers , screaming , " Assassin ! " Dog ! " Murderer ! " " If I find myself in disagreement with President Aristide , " Constant pressed on , his voice now cracking , " I pledge to work as a member of loyal opposition within the framework of a legal democracy . " " Handcuff him ! " people yelled from the crowd . " Tie him up ! Cut his balls off ! " As the barricade of troops gave way , U.S. soldiers rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chased after it , spitting and beating on the windows . U.S. authorities insisted to reporters at the time that the speech was meant to foster " reconciliation , " but one senior official told me later that it had been a disaster : " Here we were protecting him from the Haitians when we were supposed to be protecting the Haitians from him . " Throughout the occupation , ensconced in his house , where , he says , U.S. soldiers routinely came by to check on his safety , Constant tried to reinvent his past . " We 're the ones who kept this country secure for a year , " he told reporters , according to published accounts . " Nobody talks about that ... Aristide needs an opposition , and ... I am the only organization right now that ... can allow us to say there is a democracy . " But the incoming government took a different view-and within a few months Constant was ordered to appear before a magistrate investigating charges against him of torture and attempted murder . On the day of the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the courtroom . He never appeared . He told me later that on Christmas Eve of 1994 , with a small suitcase and what money he could stuff in his pockets , he had crossed the border on foot into the Dominican Republic , made his way to the airport , and then , using a valid visitors visa he had obtained before the coup , caught a plane to Puerto Rico . From there he flew to the mainland United States without incident , ending up days later on the streets of New York City . He was spotted by Haitians at nightclubs and galleries , and at one point managed to get out a radio broadcast to his followers back home . " As for you FRAPH members , " he said , according to a transcript of his statement , " close ranks , remain mobilized ... FRAPH people , where are you ? FRAPH is you . FRAPH is me . " Finally , after the Haitian government demanded that the United States do something , Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote in a March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing short of Mr. Constant 's removal from the United States can protect our foreign policy interests in Haiti . " Two months later , saying that Constant had been allowed to enter the country owing to a bureaucratic error , INS officials surrounded him in Queens as he went to buy a pack of cigarettes . They forced him to the ground and frisked him . He was taken to Wicomico County Detention Center , on the Eastern Shore of Maryland . In September a judge ordered his deportation to Haiti . As he waited for the outcome of his appeal , he wrote letters to world leaders , including Nelson Mandela . Dear Mr. President : It is hoped that this letter finds you in the best of health ... I could not hope to fill one of your footprints , yet here am I writing to one of the few men in all the world that could understand my situation , being in a white man 's jail . He grew a beard . He read Malcolm X and Che Guevara . " I am ... a POLITICAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one point he was put on a suicide watch . He wrote poetry . // Then , in December of 1995 , as the INS inched closer to deporting him , Constant decided to play the only card he had left . He threatened to divulge details of U.S. covert operations in Haiti which he said he had learned about while secretly working for the Central Intelligence Agency . THE PERFECT RECRUIT The story Constant tells begins around Christmastime , 1991 . It was shortly after the coup , and he was working at Haiti 's military headquarters when Colonel Pat Collins , the U.S. military attache at the embassy , phoned and asked him to lunch . " Let 's meet at the Holiday InnS Collins said . Collins , who , a government spokesman confirmed , was working for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency at the time , could not be reached for comment . But an associate says he was known to show up often at Haitian military headquarters . Constant says Collins was there on the night of the coup . Lynn Garrison , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junta , told me that Collins was there in the days that followed , conferring with the new regime . That day at the Holiday Inn , Constant says , he and Collins sat by a window overlooking the pool . Many people , Collins said , were impressed by Constant 's background and suggested that Constant might play an important role in the power vacuum left by Aristide 's ouster . Constant was a tempting choice for recruitment by U.S. intelligence . He spoke impeccable English , knew his way around the military , and , as one of the new regime 's top advisers , occupied an office right next to that of the junta 's head , General Cedras . Since the coup Constant had taught a course on the dangers of Aristide 's liberation theology at the training site for the National Intelligence Service ( SIN ) . The service , according to The New York Times , had been created , funded , trained , and equipped by the CIA , starting in 1986 , to combat drug trafficking , but it had quickly become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. officials , a source of drugs ) . Constant says that Collins told him in this first meeting that he wanted him to meet someone else at Collins 's home . " I 'm not going alone , " Constant remembers saying , only half joking . " rm going to come with a witness . " He says that he and an associate drove that night to Collins 's residence . Although the streets were pitch-black , owing to a fuel shortage , Collins 's house was completely lit up . Constant says they went upstairs , into a small antechamber next to the master bedroom , where a man with dark hair was waiting . He had on a short-sleeved shirt , and Constant noted his muscles . " I 'm Donald Terry , " the man said . Constant says that as they sat drinking cocktails , Terry began to pepper him with questions about the stability of the current military regime , and pulled out a booklet- " a roster " - containing the names and backgrounds of officers in the Haitian armed forces . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days later , Constant says , Terry asked to meet again , this time alone at the Kinam Hotel . " Why do n't you join the team ? " Terry asked . " What 's the team ? " " A group of people working for the benefit of Haiti " It was then , Constant says , that Terry divulged that he was an agent of the CIA . The U.S. government will not comment on any questions regarding Donald Terry ; Terry himself could not be reached . But the CIA had been deeply involved with the Haitian military and Haitian politics for decades . Constant remembers that his father served as an informal adviser to an agent who used to stop by for conferences on their porch in the 1960s . According to press reports , the Agency , after starting SIN , had planned to finance various political candidates in the 1987 presidential elections . The Senate Intelligence Committee vetoed the plan . Constant says he eventually agreed to serve as a conduit between the Haitian military regime and US. intelligence . He says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's former nationalist leader , Gamal Abdel Nasser , whom he admired , and a two-way radio , with which he checked in regularly . It is impossible to confirm all the details in Constant 's account . For the record , a CIA spokesman stated that it was " not our policy " to confirm or deny relationships with any individuals ; he would not discuss Constant . But there is little doubt that Constant was a paid informant . After Allan Nairn first reported Constant 's connection to the intelligence community , in The Nation in October of 1994 , several officials acknowledged it to reporters , and many have confirmed it to me recently . What has been a mystery is the nature of the relationship : just how big an asset was Constant ? U.S. authorities have maintained that he was nothing more than a two-bit snitch . But interviews with several people connected to the intelligence community , together with Constant 's own version of events , suggest that from the beginning he was a generous font of information , and later , according to at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he helped to run a little-known operation called the Bureau of Information and Coordination , which collected various kinds of data : the number of deaths and arrests in Haiti , the number of adherents of liberation theology , and so forth . Constant says the data collection was for the purposes of economic development , but it clearly had another purpose : military intelligence . According to Constant and to a non-Haitian connected to the intelligence community , Constant and another BIC member were the first to enter one of Aristide 's private quarters , where they found a hoard of secret documents . Some of these ended up in the hands of U.S. intelligence officers , who in turn provided the documentation for controversial reports claiming that Aristide was mentally unbalanced , contributing to the voices against him in the United States . A former senior CIA official justified using an informant who was as potentially problematic as Constant thus : " You ca n't help these bad guys accomplish stuff , but you got to give " em money to find out what 's happening in groups like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrorist group like FRAPH , you 're not going to get any functional equivalent ... of a Western democrat ... To find out what 's going on , you rather rapidly end up in the same position as the FBI with the Mafia-recruiting and paying money and even granting freedom to lower-level folks , even some high-level folks . " Another former high-ranking government intelligence official put it more bluntly : " Look , we could have gone to the nuns in Haiti and asked them to give us information . But I 'm sorry-the nuns are nice people , but what they know about terrorism is nothing . " This same official observed that Constant was " one of a whole range of people we had relationships with , all with the knowledge of the Administration . " He said he believed that Constant stood somewhere " on the spectrum of the relationship , from someone who talked to you occasionally to tell you things he wanted you to know to someone who was a wholly owned , salaried subsidiary , who provided information even to the detriment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he officially created FRAPH , in 1993 , he had been assigned another handler  --  John Kambourian , a strong , no-nonsense sort , who , Constant says , would drive with him through the mountains of Petionville , exchanging information . When I reached Kambourian by telephone and asked him about Constant , he told me to speak to public affairs at the State Department and hung up . It remains unclear how involved U.S. intelligence officers were , if they were involved at all , in the actual formation and evolution of FRAPH . A CIA spokesman , Mark Mansfield , stated for the record that the " CIA had no role in creating , funding , or guiding the FRAPH organization . But Lynn Garrison told me that when Constant was trying to start a secret police force , long before FRAPH , Collins told Garrison directly , " Let 's let it play out and see where it takes us " One U.S. government official involved with Haiti during the military regime goes even further , saying he thinks it was common knowledge in intelligence circles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official organization ( by which time Collins had left the country ) . " If he did n't found FRAPH ; " this official told me , " he was at least very , very close to it . ' Trying to explain why the CIA or the Defense Intelligence Agency might form such an alliance , this official added , " People are always looking for counterbalance , and at that point Aristide was not in power . I 'm not excusing it , but they did n't quite know what FRAPH was going to become . " Despite the existence at the time of internal State Department documents portraying the organization 's members as thugs and assassins , Constant says that his handlers never asked him about FRAPH 's alleged rapes and murders . What 's more , Constant says , the CIA and the DIA encouraged him to help derail Aristide 's return and even knew beforehand about his demonstrations against the Harlan County , which helped to delay the invasion for nearly a year . A CIA spokesman denied to me that the Agency pushed its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. envoy to Haiti at the time , along with other U.S. officials , publicly accused the CIA of exaggerating the threat of the Harlan Count , thereby derailing Aristide 's return and , in essence , pursuing its own agenda . And Constant says , " If I 'm guilty of all these things they say , then they are guilty of them too " THE BREAKUP Toto Constant 's relationship with U.S. intelligence , according to both Constant and several CIA officials , continued undisturbed until the spring of 1994 . It was then , Constant says , that Kambourian called and said they had to meet . He told Constant to bring the radio . " I 'm sorry , " Constant remembers Kambourian 's saying , " but we ca n't see you anymore . " " Why ? " Constant asked . Kambourian said that in the wake of the Harlan County incident and Constant 's rhetoric against the President , Washington wanted to sever its ties . U.S. officials say that intelligence ties to Constant were more or less cut at this point Cooperation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October of 1994 American forces stormed FRAPH headquarters . Afraid for his life , Constant went to meet Lieutenant General Henry Shelton , who was in charge of the occupation . Constant recalls , " I told Shelton straight out , " I 'm a son of a general , and I inherited his honor and dignity , and that 's why Fm here to ask what the rules of engagement are , because I do n't understand them . " ' The answer he got seems to have been a blunt one . General Shelton , who is now the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , declined my requests for an interview , but his staff provided me with the transcript of an oral history , which Shelton recorded during the invasion and in which he vividly describes at least part of the encounter with Constant . " I had no desire at all to meet with Constant ... as far as I was concerned , we had potentially disarmed and disabled his organization from top to bottom . ' But he said that Constant had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Major General David Meade decided to see if they could get from him what they wanted : first , that he provide a complete list of FRAPH members and the location of their weapon caches ; second , that he call each one of his key thugs and tell them to surrender their arms ; and third , that he publicly accept Aristide 's return and transform FRAPH into a peaceful political party . " We were using a little bit of psychological warfare on Constant , " Shelton , in his oral history , disclosed . " I sent Meade in first Meade was to go in and tell Constant that he was getting ready to meet the big guy ... I gave Meade about twenty or thirty minutes to set the conditions , and then I arrived and my security guy , the SEAL , entered the room ... rattling the doors and kicking on doors to make sure the place was secure before I came in , as they always did . But Constant saw all this , and it was kind of like seeing a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got very nervous at that time , and his eyes got very big . " It was then , Shelton said , that Meade walked out and he walked in . " Constant immediately stood up and smiled and stuck out his hand , at which time I just said to myself , " Remember two things-force and death they understand . ' So I looked at him and I said , " Sit down ! " and he immediately sat down , and the smile left his face ... and I said to him , " I understand that you have agreed to all the conditions that we have set for you to keep us from hunting you down and members of your organization . ' And he said , " Oh , yes , yes , I have no problem with any of that . ' And then he started , " But Haiti is ... " and he started into his role about the history of Haiti and how important the FRAPH is . I let him get about ten seconds into that , and I cut him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in hearing any of that right now . " The very next day Constant gave the speech accepting Aristide 's return and casting himself as the new leader of the democratic opposition . According to a highly placed U.S. official , the speech was outlined by Constant 's old CIA contact , Kambourian , and handed over to the U.S. embassy , which in turn dictated it to Constant , who apparently accepted it without his usual bravado . " He could have been imprisoned , " the official told me , " but the judgment was made that as long as we could get out of him what we wanted , it would be okay for him to walk around . " General Shelton may have wanted little to do with Constant , but other elements of the U.S. government seem to have done more than just keep an eye on him . Immigration authorities told me it was " impossible to believe , " as one put it , and " totally bogus , " as another put it , that Constant could have entered the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from someone in the U.S. government or forged documents . " Everyone knew he was a killer , " says one former INS official . " His picture was everywhere . " Constant told me that he did n't ask for any help in getting out , but that he did alert certain U.S. officials before he left , and " it 's possible they did something . " A high-ranking intelligence-community source , although not commenting directly on Constant 's case , described the background mechanisms : " On the high end of the spectrum , the director of the CIA can bring in fifty to a hundred people in the top spy category . These are people to whom we owe a lot , because they have risked their lives doing things of great value to our nation , so it is ( if you want to get out , we will get you out ; you want to get in , we will get you in , get you a house , whatever ... Lower down , you can do everything from a little help around the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wicomico County Detention Center , on the verge of being deported with the full support of the State Department and the INS , Constant leveraged the potential exposure of his old connections to save himself . Threatening to divulge the details of his relationship with the CIA , he filed a $50 million lawsuit against Warren Christopher and Janet Reno for wrongful imprisonment . " CIA operatives collaborated with the Plaintiff , " his lawyer maintained in the suit . To underscore his warning he appeared on 60 Minutes in December of 1995 in his prison jumpsuit . " I feel like that beautiful woman that everybody wants to go to bed with at night , but not during the daytime : , he told Ed Bradley . " I want everybody to know that we are dating " It was at this point that Benedict Ferro , who was the district director of the INS in Baltimore at the time of Constant 's incarceration , began to see things that he had never seen before and that were , as he puts it now , " off the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than thirty years , and he was used to working on cases that involved sensitive government issues . After Constant made his threats , Ferro says , highly placed officials throughout the government began to get involved , even though the Administration had already publicly and privately indicated that Constant would be returned . A cover page from a May 24 , 1996 , Justice Department memorandum titled " Emmanuel Constant Options " indicates that those consulted in the process included Samuel Berger , the deputy national-security adviser ; Strobe Talbott , the deputy secretary of State ; Jamie Gorelick , the deputy attorney general ; and David Cohen , the deputy director of operations for the CIA . ( The cover page was one of several released to the National Security Archive through the Freedom of Information Act ; the memo itself was not released . ) " Look , they came out of the woodwork when Constant started singing : " says Ferro , who is now the president of INSGreencard.com . By the time of the memo Constant had already been held in prison for just over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States could detain him under what many legal experts consider to be an extremely murky part of immigration law . It was then- " at the eleventh hour , " as Ferro recalls  --  that government officials received information regarding a plot to assassinate Constant when he was returned to Haiti . At least some at the INS maintained that , even if true , the report merely meant that Constant should remain in a U.S. prison until a later date . " We have Cubans from the Mariel boatlift who remain in jail , " Ferro says . " We have people from the Middle East who are in jail who ca n't be sent back . This is not a new process . " But according to several officials involved in the deliberations , the information swayed the senior decision-makers . " I did n't want to send someone , even a killer like Constant , to his summary execution " one person involved in the case told me . When I asked one senior official who it was that had uncovered the plot on Constant 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reliable U.S. intelligence sources . Ferro and several of his colleagues at the INS made one last attempt to press their views , insisting that they could not in good conscience send a suspected terrorist into a community where he might harm U.S. citizens or where , just as likely , U.S. citizens might harm him . But it did n't matter . The final decision was hammered out over several days , and senior officials from the Justice Department , the State Department , and the National Security Council participated . " To this day I ca n't understand why he 's not rotting in a U.S. jail , " Ferro says . " We were not reinventing the process . He was just treated differently than any other murderer or terrorist . " Ferro himself gave Constant the good news . " They called me at the prison and said I could get my things and go , " Constant says today , still surprised . " I basically just read from the script " Ferro says . " This guy was believed to have murdered and assassinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . It was outrageous . " A copy of the legal settlement that set the terms for Constant 's release , which I obtained from Constant , reveals certain conditions : Constant must live in his mother 's home in Queens and must remain within the confines of the borough except for visits to the INS office in Manhattan ; he must check in with the Immigration and Naturalization Service every Tuesday ; and he must not talk about , among other things , Haitian politics or the details of the legal agreement . " I like exposure , " he says , " so this is the worst thing they can do to me , this gag order . " ( As may by now be apparent , Constant takes an expansive view of the restrictions . ) Constant 's formal legal status is this : he is under an outstanding order of deportation whose execution has been withheld on the advice of the State Department . When I recently asked Warren Christopher about the deal with Constant , he said he could not recollect the details of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later his assistant called and said that he still did n't have " sufficient recollection of the matter that you discussed to comment , and unfortunately it would entail flying back East to look at his old paperwork , and unfortunately he is not able to do that at this time . " Constant 's lawyer , J. D. Larosiliere , who has continued to cite the threat to his client 's life and the protection to which Constant is thus entitled under the UN Convention Against Torture , says , " I knew that he was n't going to be deported , but I needed a hook in the legal system to allow them to have a way out Plausible deniability . That 's all this game is about . Plausible deniability . " Indeed , to many Haitians and human-rights workers the real motive for Constant 's release was clear even without knowing precisely what had occurred behind closed doors : to shield the CIA 's association with FRAPH , the U.S. government needed Constant 's silence . A " TELL ALL " AUTOBIOGRAPHY " My conscience is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him in his lawyers office . When I pressed him about FRAPH murders and rapes , he said that there was no evidence implicating him and that he could not be held accountable for every member of such a sprawling operation . " If somebody the day of the vote killed another individual in the street of New York , and they found he just voted Democrat , they 're not going to make Clinton responsible , " he said . He leaned back in his chair , as if trying to think of his next point , and then , as if it had just dawned on him , he pulled out a piece of paper and began to scribble on it . Trying to illuminate the logic of the military regime , he drew a circle in the center and wrote the word " army " inside it . Then he drew two circles orbiting around the first-one marked " the people " and the other " FRAPH " " In Haiti our democratic instrument has always been the army since 1804 , " he said , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed up with the government , it is the army which represents that same populace that overthrows the government . The army is the extension of the people . ' He said all this without a hint of insincerity . Indeed , he seemed happy to be telling his side of the story , and at the conclusion of this first interview he invited me to his house in Queens , where he was living , as he put it , " like a hostage . " Part of a long row of nearly identical English odors in Laurelton , the house looked on the outside like a dump : the facade , once white , was weather-stained , the front steps needed paint , and the storm window overlooking the porch was shattered . Haitians had told me , among other things , that Constant kept the bones of his victims in his room , practiced late-night voodoo rituals , stored CIA arms in the basement , and shot trespassers . Some people were afraid to walk past the front yard , and one neighborhood kid told me that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look in the window at night , where they could see " the devil " sitting by himself . As I hesitated on the stoop , the front door suddenly opened and Constant appeared , holding a cigarette . " Come on in , " he said . I followed him into the living room , which was musty and dimly lit , the walls covered with Haitian art , the couches and chairs draped in plastic . Constant sat across from me in a rocker , swaying back and forth as he smoked . He handed me several piles of documents that , he said , established his innocence , including FRAPH speeches , cables between the U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince and the State Department , and a letter Constant had written to President Clinton . " There 's a lot more , " he said , " but I 've lost a lot of things since I came here . " As I started to ask him questions about his past , he took a tape recorder from his pocket and said that he was working on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of writing " he said . " I went to take a class about self-publishing your book , and one of the things the guy told me was if you 're talking about your past , then record yourself . " I thought perhaps he just wanted to make sure I quoted him correctly , but a moment later he showed me a book proposal : " This proposal offers a " hot " new " tell all , expose on Emmanuel TOTO ' Constant code name " GAMAL , " and FRAPH ... The market analysis suggests that with at least 2 million Haitians in the U.S. and at least 50,000 others in the U.S. who have interest in Haiti this book could easily sell over 1 million copies . " The proposal promised that the book , tentatively titled Echoes of Silence , would serve as a treatise on what Constant called the " poli-military organization . " He had even drawn up a dummy book jacket that said , Emmanuel " Toto " Constant , notorious leader of FRAPH ... and alleged murderer , rapist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his heart , he exposes the real man behind the villainous images . Interesting , provocative , informative and sensitive , Echoes of Silence candidly portrays the complexities of life in Haiti , where nothing is simple . It might lead one to conclude : The political frenzy in Haiti , as addictive and dangerous as any narcotic , keeps the masses alive mentally and emotionally even while it kills . This was Constant 's latest attempt to earn a living . Since his release from prison , as I would learn during our talks , he had tried all sorts of ways to set himself up . He had taken computer classes . He had sold used cars . But each time he had found an opportunity , the other Haitian immigrants in the community had risen up and driven him from his job . " I 'm a prisoner , " he said . And then , " The worst time is when they came in front of the real-estate office ... because I really had a good situation " Since that day , last August , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which mostly meant selling and renting properties as covertly as he could . Whenever I was with him , his cell phone rang . Usually he slipped into Creole , but occasionally he 'd say things like " I can show you the place tomorrow . No problem . Heat included . Okay flu revoir . " He told me he was concentrating on credit reports , because a lot of Haitians were unfamiliar with them . " I need to establish some kind of income here , " he said . Once I listened to him raise and lower his voice like an auctioneer : " Hello . Oui . Oui ... I saw the apartment ... They were asking one thousand , one hundred dollars , and ril bring it down to a thousand ... Everything is included ... Okay ? ... It 's Cambria Heights , very nice neighborhood , very quiet , very , very safe ... I 'm working very hard for you . " His wife called one day , from Canada , where she had gone with their four children out of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said when he hung up , lighting another cigarette . " We 're having discussions about the kids . I wanted them to come the way they used to , and she does n't want them to . So we 're having an argument , but everything will be okay . " After a while his phone rang again , and I asked if I could look around the place . " No problem , " he said . I headed upstairs , past several cracked walls and closed doors . Constant 's room was on the third floor . It was small and cluttered with videos and men 's fashion magazines . By his bed was a framed picture of him from his appearance on 60 Minutes . In one corner was a small shrine . Candles and figurines of Catholic saints , which often play a role in voodoo , were arranged in a neat circle . As I bent down to inspect them , Constant called out my name . One of the statues was the patron saint of justice ; on its base was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will never cease to honor thee as my special and powerful patron " Constant called my name again , and I hurried downstairs . " Let 's go out " he said , putting on a leather jacket . The Haitian community in New York , as in Haiti , is segregated , largely according to class . The poorest Haitians are in Brooklyn , and those of greater wealth and status have fanned out into more-affluent settlements like Laurelton and Cambria Heights . As we walked through Laurelton , I could smell roasting griot , or pork . The sound of compas , Haitian dance music , blared from grocery stores . We passed several men smoking in the cold , chatting in Creole . " I need some meat , " Constant said , heading toward a butcher shop . The store was packed , and we could barely fit inside . A small circle of Haitians were playing cards in the back . As Constant pressed up against the counter , I realized that everyone was staring at him . " I need some goat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed at some enormous hind legs hanging from a meat hook He glanced at the back , where several people seemed to be saying something about him , but he appeared unfazed . The butcher began to cut through the bone and gristle of a goat leg . His thick arm pushed down , slicing in clean strokes . " Everybody here knows who I am , " Constant said on the way out . " Everybody . They 've all read about me or seen my picture . " He darted across the street to a barbershop . A CLOSED sign hung on the door , but he could see the barber inside , and Constant banged on the window , pleading with him to take one more customer . " There 's another barbershop down the street , " he told me , " but if I went there they 'd slit my ... " His voice trailed off as he drew his fingers across his throat and let out a strange laugh . A COURTHOUSE IN HAITI The trial was more than a thousand miles away from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court began trying Constant on charges of murder , attempted murder , and being an accomplice to murder and torture  --  charging him , in effect , with the Raboteau massacre . I went there with J. D. Larosiliere in October , as the trial was reaching its climax . Twenty-two people-mostly soldiers and FRAPH paramilitaries-were being prosecuted in person . Constant and the leaders of the junta were being tried in absentia . Photograph // As the last U.S. troops prepared to pull out , the country was , as ever , a shambles . Although the Clinton Administration 's policies had stemmed the bloodshed , success in " nationbuilding " was elusive . Eighty percent of the people were unemployed , and two thirds were malnourished . Gangs still roamed the streets . Drug-running planes took off and landed with impunity . Even the heralded new democratic system was believed to be rife with fraud . Aristide , after having put his protege Rene Preval in power , was running for the presidency again amid allegations that he was trying to pack the parliament with his supporters . Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the left , were beginning to occur again . " Now everyone knows I was right " Constant told me later . " Everyone has seen what has happened under Aristide . " The trial itself was a potential flash point for violence . The U.S. embassy warned Americans to stay away from the area for fear of " large scale demonstrations , tire burnings , rock throwing and worse . " As our plane landed , Larosiliere told me that he had been warned about potential assassination attempts . " If they attack me , it will only help me prove my case : ' he said . - if I 'm not safe , then how can my client be safe ? " At the airport we met a large man with mirrored sunglasses and a military bearing , who would serve as Larosiliere 's " attache . " " You can not depend on the police to have security , " the attache told me . " So you need to be armed to protect yourself . " The attache pushed our way through a crowd of taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smelled flesh and sweat and food , and as we rushed to the car , I tried to deflect the arms outstretched to help me with my things . " Welcome to Haiti , " Larosiliere said . The city of Gonaives , where the courthouse was located , is only seventy miles from Port-au-Prince , but it took us half a day to get there . Nearly all the roads in Haiti are unpaved . The Americans started to build a paved road after the invasion , but they gave up and the road now ends abruptly on the edge of a slum . We rumbled past Aristide 's new estate on the outskirts of the capital , where he increasingly secludes himself ; past the old Club Med , abandoned since 1999 , along with almost all the other tourist sites ; past irrigated plains where peasants rolled up their pant legs to wade through fields of rice . Then we headed north , past arid , desolate land where nothing seemed to grow but cacti until we came upon Gonaives . The courthouse was in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent mobs from rushing in . We entered a small , squat building , where armed guards searched us for weapons ; the attache told me he had left his gun behind , but he stayed close to Larosiliere 's side . We passed through one room and then another ; finally , to my surprise , we headed into an open courtyard , where the trial was being held under a billowing white canopy . The judge sat at a table , wearing a black robe and a tall hat with a white band . He had a bell in place of a gavel . To one side of him , sitting in neat rows , were the prosecution and the jury ; to the other side were the defense and the twenty-two accused , behind a cordon of armed guards . Larosiliere joined the defense , and the attache and I sat at the end opposite the judge , with the scores of observers and alleged victims . I bad barely sat down when a lawyer for the prosecution began to scream at Larosiliere , jabbing his hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was and why he was there . The attache , who had been at my side , was on his feet before Larosiliere answered . The crowd filled with murmurs : " Toto Constant ! Toto Constant ! " People looked around as if Constant might be under the canopy . The lawyer began to bark again at Larosiliere ; the attache now stood by Larosiliere 's side , his arms crossed on his chest . Most of the alleged victims had already testified that on April 22 , 1994 , soldiers and FRAPH members had descended on the village of Raboteau , known for its staunch support of Aristide . They described being driven from their homes , forced into open sewers , robbed , and tortured . In past attacks the villagers had fled to the sea , where their fishing boats were tied up . But when they did so this time , they said , the attackers were waiting for them in boats and opened fire . " In order to escape ... I took to the seal one of the villagers , Henri-Claude Elisme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard my boat ; I saw Claude Jean ... fall under the soldiers ' bullets . ' Abdel Saint Louis , a thirty-two-year-old sailor , said , " I fled ... into a boat . At sea I saw another boat arrive . Thinking they were people trying to escape , I came closer to them . I then saw Youfou , a FRAPH member , piloting a group of soldiers . They fired in my direction . I called for help . They arrested me , beat me , and forced me to guide the boat . Seeing other people in a boat , the soldiers fired in their direction and hit two girls : Rosiane and Deborah . " By the end of the assault , according to the prosecution witnesses , dozens of people were wounded and at least six were dead ; the prosecution estimated that the actual toll was much higher . Most of the bodies had allegedly been buried in shallow graves along the sea and either eaten by animals or washed away . " When I went down to the shore I saw my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified . " I only found him on April 28 .. tied up with Charite Cadet ; both had been murdered . I was not authorized to remove the body ... I demand justice for my brother . " The testimony occasionally elicited angry shouts from the spectators , and the judge would ring his bell , trying to quiet the courtyard . That afternoon Karen Burns , a forensic anthropologist from the United States , was sworn in . A Canadian expert on DNA was scheduled to follow her . It would be the first time that forensic evidence and genetic evidence were introduced in a Haitian court , and the courtyard fell silent . Burns stood in the center of the gathering , surrounded by the skeletal remains of three people , excavated from the edge of the sea in Raboteau in 1995 . As she spoke , spectators and jurors craned their necks to look at the bones . Burns held up one and said , " This is the pelvis right here . " She put it down and picked up another bone . " This individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is the rope that was retrieved . ' As she held up the rope , there were several gasps . Larosiliere-who , like his client , maintains that the massacre was fabricated as propaganda to discredit FRAPH and the military regime-remained unimpressed . " I live for testimony like this , " he told me that night , drinking a glass of rum , as we sat with the attache at the hotel restaurant . " It 's bullshit . Come on ! This would n't be allowed in an American courtroom with the federal rules of evidence ! She did a scientific study on a site with no integrity . Everyone and everybody walked around it . Come on . You know I can go to graveyards and pick up skeletons from anybody and put them down . " Refilling his glass , Larosiliere said that the prosecution 's entire case was preposterous . If there had been any organized military involvement at all , he said , no evidence would have been left on the beach . - Those bodies would be put on a truck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You got it , " the attache agreed . "  --  or the highway  --  " " At night , " the attache added . "  --  and dumped into  --  " " The source Puante , " the attache said . " Sulfur ditches , " Larosiliere explained . " The best place , because the sulfur eats the body . " As he spoke , several international human-rights observers sat down next to us . They stared at Larosiliere , whom they recognized from the courtroom . His voice seemed to grow louder as he noticed them . Finally one of them began to argue with him about Constant . " If for one instant , sir , I believed that Haiti could sustain a true trial for my clients I 'd be the first one to throw him on the plane , " Larosiliere said . Later I asked Brian Concannon , an American humanrights lawyer who had spent most of the previous five years in Haiti spearheading the trial , if he thought Larosiliere 's concern about the fairness of the tribunal was legitimate . Concannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the judicial system , which had received more than $25 million in American aid for reform , had slowly and steadily evolved in recent years . The judge and one of the prosecutors , for instance , had gone through a training program funded in part by the United States ; another prosecutor had gone to France , where he studied at a judicial academy . Concannon said that although it had taken years to accomplish , the trial was extraordinarily fair by any standard . Indeed , he said , it had become a kind of prototype for the judicial system in Haiti . Perhaps most important , despite fears by Constant that he would be killed , not a single defendant so far had been harmed in prison or in a courtroom . " The defendants were given the benefit of all their rights under Haitian law and under international treaties to which Haiti is a party , " Concannon said . " They were allowed to present witnesses , alibis , and exculpatory evidence . " As for Constant , Concannon said , the case was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after World War II and , more recently , war criminals in Yugoslavia and Rwanda . " Constant started an organization that was specifically designed to carry out-and in fact carried out-massive violations of human rights ; " he said . " Constant then provided that organization with training , money , and weapons . He has liability as a commander . It was the same with Nuremberg . He was in charge of a criminal organization and is responsible for the crimes of that organization . " Though there was no evidence that Constant had been on the scene at Raboteau , Concannon said , there was indisputable evidence that FRAPH members participated in the attack and systematically terrorized the community . And , he said , there was probably more evidence against Constant in the thousands of pages of secret documents confiscated by U.S. soldiers in their 1994 raid on FRAPH headquarters , documents the Clinton Administration had so far refused to return to Haiti-fueling allegations that Washington was trying to conceal its ties to FRAPH and Constant . On the second day of our visit Larosiliere decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rose from his chair and stood stiffly in the courtroom . The trial came to a halt , and everyone stared at him . Then he marched out the door , the attache a few feet behind him . There was an angry chorus of murmurs . A prosecution lawyer denounced the move as merely a ruse , a sign that Constant 's lawyer had intended from the outset not to use the tribunal for justice but only to discredit it . ( " My understanding of an adequate murder defense is that you spend more than a few hours at the trial " Concannon told me . " We 've worked on this case full-time for four and a half years . " ) After Larosiliere left , I sat for a while and stared at the dozens of alleged victims sitting on the back benches . Many of them had bought suits for the trial . The young women , some of whom had been shot , wore white dresses that somehow stayed pristine in the dusty heat ; they sat with their backs perfectly straight . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pressure their government for justice . They had written songs about what had happened . And they sat there now , as rain began to fall , and as a clerk collected the bones strewn on the table , and as rumors filled the country that another coup attempt had been thwarted in the capital . As I finally rose to go , a young man who had seen me arrive with Constant 's lawyer stopped me ; before I could say anything , he spat at my shoe and walked away . THE VERDICT " They tried to get me to come out to beat me up , " Constant told me shortly after I returned . He was eating a piece of chocolate cake in a Queens diner . Tensions in the community had intensified since the beginning of the trial . ' Larosiliere had told him to leave the house during such demonstrations , to avoid confrontations . But Constant always remained nearby . " I have to protect my mother and aunt in case one of them go crazy , " he told me . Ricot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There are Haitian groups who have toyed with the idea of taking the law into their own hands and killing him . ' Constant claims he has a small coterie of supporters who keep an eye out for him . " I can tell you , when they come in front of my place , fifty percent of the people out there are my people , " he said . " They pass by in case there is any trouble " Though it is hard to know the precise numbers , Constant maintains some hold over a small following of former FRAPH members , Tonton Macoutes , soldiers , and Duvalierists who also live in exile . Demonstrators say that in at least one instance a car showed up outside his house to monitor them . " They came by taking pictures of us , and we took pictures of them , " Ray Laforest told me . " I do n't want to play a deadly game , " Constant said of Laforest , " but I have stuff on him , and ... " He let his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constant in his house , reading a copy of his book manuscript . Someone had helped him write the first few chapters . My media image , both internationally and in the U.S. , has been a source of anguish for me . Topics that suggest my alleged involvement with the CIA , being a human rights abuser , operating " voodoo politics , " being a bogeyman , making Haiti " a place of fear , " being a tough guy , " a " gunman , " " dog , " an " attache , " and , last but not least , a " spook , " an " S.O.B . " and a " double spy " have been a source of wonderment about why I have been so suddenly accused in the media . As I was reading , the phone rang in the kitchen . Constant went to it , and I could hear him speaking in Creole . A moment later he walked back into the room . " You 're here for a part of history , " he said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to hard labor , and they 're taking over all my property in Haiti . " He dropped into his rocking chair , looking around the room . He lit a cigarette and rocked back and forth . Apparently the jury had deliberated for four hours and had found sixteen of the twenty-two defendants in custody guilty , twelve of them for premeditated murder or being accomplices to murder . All those in absentia were convicted of murder and ordered to pay the victims millions of dollars in damages . " I hate to lose my things back home , " Constant said , " because eventually my mother has to go back there " He lit another cigarette and pulled on it deeply . " I better call J.D. , " he said , referring to Larosiliere . He picked up his cell phone , trying to concentrate . " They have a verdict against me , " he said into the phone , leaving a message for his lawyer . " I need to speak to him Okay ? They have sentenced me to life and hard labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Constant picked it up in a hurry . But it was a reporter asking him for a comment . He stumbled through something and hung up . The phone rang again . It was Larosiliere . " What do you thinks going to happen here ? " Constant asked nervously . " Okay ... yes ... okay . " He handed me the phone . I could hear Larosiliere 's voice crackling through the receiver before I put it to my ear . " I have one word to say about all this : bullshit . " Larosiliere said that the Haitian government would now try to extradite Constant , claiming that a legitimate tribunal had convicted him with the blessing of international observers . But , he said , they still had to show that the verdict was fair and prove in a U.S. court that Constant deserved to be sent back . It is important to point out that under Haitian law , if Constant surrenders or is arrested , he will have the right to a new trial Constant called me a few days later . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there that they 're about to arrest me , " he said , " that they 're coming for me . " He said he had to check in with the INS the following day , as he did every Tuesday , but he was afraid the authorities might be planning to seize him this time . " Can you meet me there ? " By the time I arrived at the INS office in Manhattan the next morning , he was already standing by the entrance . It was cold , and his trench coat was wrapped around him . He told me that his mother , who was in Florida , had called to tell him that other Haitian exiles had been arrested . I could see circles under his eyes . Pacing back and forth , he said that he had stayed at a friend 's house the night before , in case the authorities showed up at his house to arrest him . I followed him into the elevator and up to the twelfth floor . The room was filled with immigrants . Constant tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Statue of Liberty hung , but the woman there said they were n't ready for him yet . He sat down and started to ponder why he had been kept free for so long . " This is what I 'm trying to find out and that nobody has been able to analyze it with me . Why are they keeping me alive ? I do n't know why , in fact . A friend of mine told me one day , he works for intelligence her and he said there is somebody , somewhere , that is following everything about me , every court paper , every legal action , every immigration matter , and this is the only person that really knows why they are keeping me alive . " A few minutes later someone yelled out his name , and he leaped to his feet . He approached the desk with his INS form and checked in , as always . The woman took the sheet of paper and walked into a back room , where she consulted with somebody . Then the woman returned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the elevator , calling his mother to say he was okay , and rushing across the street to buy a new suit in celebration of his freedom . The next week two dozen Toto Watchers gathered outside the INS carrying signs that showed alleged FRAPH victims : a murdered boy with a shirt pulled over his head ; two men lying in a pool of blood . " We are here to demand that Toto Constant be sent back to Haiti to stand trial for crimes against the Haitian people , " Kim Ives , a writer for the Brooklyn-based newspaper Haiti Progress yelled through a bullhorn . " If you 're opposed to war criminals and to deathsquad- leaders living as your neighbors in New York City , please join us . " Human-rights activists began to join the protesters . There was a sense that this was the last chance to persuade the U.S. government to send Constant back to Haiti-that if it would n't do so now , after the conviction , it never would . A UN expert on Haiti , Adama Dieng , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already called the verdict " a landmark in the fight against impunity " and in one of the last moves of the Clinton Administration , according to two U.S. officials , the documents confiscated during the raid on FRAPH headquarters had been sent back to Haiti . So far the files have not been made public , but they may contain more evidence of FRAPH 's crimes and could add to the case for Constant 's extradition . Still , most activists remain skeptical . Brian Concannon told me after the trial , " The presence of such a horrible killer in the U.S. shows that the U.S. supports those activities . There is , unfortunately , no other credible explanation . " Outside the INS office several in the crowd were bent over , trying to light candles in the freezing wind . " How can they not send him back ? " a Haitian man asked me . " He has been found guilty by a Haitian court . Why is the CIA protecting him ? " Suddenly there was a loud , unified chant from the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We charge you with genocide ! " Au REVOIR ? At one of our last meetings , after Jean-Bertrand Aristide and George W Bush had each been sworn in to their respective offices , Constant called and said he had to see me . His legal status remained unchanged . He had been talking to his " advisers , " he said , and he needed to tell me something . The political terrain had shifted in both countries , he said . There was more and more resistance to Aristide , even in Queens . Bombs had recently exploded in Port-au-Prince , and the regime had blamed Constant . He denied any role , but he said that Haitians from all over were calling , waiting for him to act , to step up . At the Haitian restaurant where we met , he told me that people had " been publishing articles , and they say , " Look at this guy who has been convicted for murder in Haiti and he 's getting stronger and stronger every day . " He sipped a glass of rum . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have n't heard from me . They do n't know what 's going to happen , but everyone has their eyes on me , and people are sending me their phone numbers from Haiti . People here try to reach me . Political leaders are trying to reach me . There is a perception that if ... Aristide is on the go , Fm the only one that can step in . I ca n't let that thing get to my head . I have to be very careful and analyze it and make it work for me . " As people entered the restaurant , Constant looked over his shoulder to check them out . He waited for two Haitian men to sit down , and then be turned back to me and said that he had to do something dramatic or he would be a hostage in Queens for the rest of his life . " If I stand up and make a press conference , and even if I do n't say anything but I just attack Aristide , that 's going to give strength to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the former military , that 's going to give strength to the former FRAPH members , that 's going to give strength to everyone who did n't have the guts because they did n't see who would take the lead " He had recently received a new spate of death threats , he said . Someone had gotten hold of his cell-phone number and had warned , " I 'm going to get you no matter what you do " I asked if he was afraid of what might happen if he so brazenly broke his gag order and called a press conference . He said that he was n't sure what would happen , but it was his destiny . " I 've been prepared since young for a mission , and that 's why I 've stayed alive , he said . He glanced over his shoulder again , and then he leaned toward me . " I 'm either going to be President of Haiti " he said , " or I 'm going to be killed . " <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
