Thomas Moore 's article is quite successful both in describing U.S. economic strategy in the Asia-Pacific and in discussing different perspectives on the nature of American power . It is well organized , analytical , and balanced . With regard to U.S. economic strategy in the Asia-Pacific , I believe Washington 's objectives include at least the following : broadening market access for U.S. goods and services , expanding the group of market economies , promoting regime building and multilateralism , and keeping the United States engaged and dominant in regional economic activities . Washington 's attitude during the 1990s toward proposals for an East Asian Economic Caucus ( initiated by Malaysia ) and an Asian Monetary Fund ( sponsored by Japan ) reveals that the United States is determined to prevent the emergence of any regional economic group in East Asia that excludes the United States and embraces Japan 's leadership . <p> As noted by Moore , the promotion of political change is supposed to be an inherent mission of U.S. economic strategy in the region . However , as reflected in the debate in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renamed " normal trade relations " in recent years ) , there are longstanding questions in the United States concerning how it should use its economic leverage . That debate reached a crescendo during congressional deliberations over whether to grant permanent normal trade relations to China . One school advocates the positive use of America 's economic leverage , namely , by broadening economic engagement with China and encouraging China 's own economic and political liberalization . The other school argues that the United States should use its economic leverage in a negative manner , namely , by punishing China for its failure to introduce political change . Such a debate mirrors not only an intellectual difference but also a constant tension in the United States over the conduct of economic strategy and political strategy towards China . <p> Is the United States a benign hegemon ? For some countries the answer is " yes . " Those countries rely on the economic opportunity created by American markets , technology , and investment , as well as access to the U.S.-led international economic system more generally . However , a benign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to U.S. markets for goods , capital , and technology , Washington seeks in return important political , economic , and security concessions from other countries . If they fail to meet U.S. demands , their access to the U.S. economy or to U.S.-controlled resources will be denied or reduced . Neither is the United States an enlightened hegemon . If U.S. supremacy is challenged , its rivals will find themselves running into hard times . This was true for both the former Soviet Union ( in politico-military affairs during the latter stages of the Cold War ) and for Japan ( in the economic field in the late 1980s and early 1990s ) . In addition , the United States often fails to be a fair player in international economic activities , Indeed , there are many cases in which Washington has sought to set the rules of the game primarily to U.S. advantage and asked for concessions from other countries that go beyond the limits of international norms . <p> The selfishness of U.S. economic strategy in the Asia-Pacific was highlighted by American behavior during the Asian Financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any substantive actions during the first stage when Thailand , Malaysia , and Indonesia were stricken by the crisis , partly because Washington did not perceive that there would be much adverse impact on the U.S. economy , and partly because some in the United States were eager to see the bankruptcy of the so-called Asian model that had been credited with the Asian economic miracle . The United States , however , began to intervene when the financial epidemic spread to South Korea and appeared likely to spill over into the already stagnant Japanese economy . Those developments held out the worrisome prospect that the U.S. economy , and even the entire world economic system , would be undermined . That sequence of events implies that the United States ultimately provided a bailout mainly to secure its own interests . The United States was also criticized for manipulating the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to pursue its own agenda . When the IMF was about to provide bailout loans to South Korea and Indonesia , the U.S. government , together with the IMF , insisted on extensive conditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restructuring of the recipients ' domestic economies . Those conditions , as illustrated by the case of South Korea , reflected U.S. interests . As then assistant treasury secretary Larry Summers put it , " The United States achieved more changes in the Korean economy as a result of the IMF packages than we did in twenty years of bilateral negotiations , " <p> Moore suggests that American officials generally see themselves as working with , rather than striving to achieve dominance over , other countries . But many American officials also believe that the United States is the only qualified leader in the world . In that sense , leadership in world affairs has become a self-imposed destiny for America since the end of World War II . During the Cold War , that ambition was covered by concern in the West over the Soviet threat and the desire to defend the " free world . " With the end of the Cold War , Washington has become much more vocal in endeavoring to build the Pax Americana . In fact , if there is an overarching goal in U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemonic stability . For that purpose , the United States needs to solidify and expand the camp of its followers , transform and constrain Russia and China , and punish and weaken the so-called rogue states . U.S. economic strategy in the Asia-Pacific , consistent with its security strategy in the region , serves the purpose of extending the imbalance of power . <p> The real problem here is how the United States maintains its supremacy . Washington may behave as a responsible power and play a constructive , leading role in world affairs . In that case , a U.S. hegemony may not be seen as especially threatening and destabilizing . In other words , refraining from excessively seeking relative gains and expanding the imbalance in material terms will serve to increase the moral power of the United States . Washington can also act as an irresponsible power , doing things for purely selfish purposes without considering their consequences . Such a United States wilt be regarded as a rogue superpower . It may gain materially , but it will lose morally . The current U.S. policy on national missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close allies are concerned about its negative impact on global strategic stability and therefore advise the United States not to pursue that program . However , driven by the desire to seek unilateral and absolute security and pressured by the defense industry , Washington seems likely to go ahead with this venture . Given the long-term impact of the program , the United States will pay a high price both morally and militarily for such a decision . <p> The nature of American power is best understood comprehensively , not just in economic terms . Furthermore , there is no " either-or " answer to the question of whether U.S. hegemony is benign or malevolent . American power has multiple features and therefore requires a multidimensional , multilayered approach for complete understanding . Economically , the long-term challenge to U.S. dominance will not come from the relative decline of American power but from the ongoing process of regional integration . Enlightened by the Asian Financial Crisis , countries in East Asia are now more aware of the need to strengthen regional economic cooperation and have begun to move in that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union to enhance its integrated defense after Kosovo , despite U.S. pique . Although it is too early to envisage a common market or a single currency in East Asia , there will certainly be greater and more institutionalized economic cooperation within the region . As East Asian integration deepens , Washington 's paramount influence in the region will inevitably be compromised . <p> By Wu Xinbo <p>
