For the last five minutes , I 'd been parked outside my cousin Vinnie 's bail bonds office in my crapola car , debating whether to continue on with my day , or return to my apartment and crawl back into bed . My name is Stephanie Plum , and Sensible Stephanie wanted to go back to bed . Loco Stephanie was thinking she should get on with it . I was about to do something I knew I should n't do . The signs were all there in front of me . Sick stomach . Feeling of impending disaster . Knowledge that it was illegal . And yet , I was going to forge ahead with the plan . Not that this was especially unusual . Truth is , I 've been dealing with impending doom for as long as I can remember . Heck , when I was six years old I sprinkled sugar on my head , convinced myself it was pixie dust , wished myself invisible , and walked into the boys ' bathroom at school . I mean , you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? The door to the bonds office opened , and Lula stuck her head out . " Are you gon na sit there all day , or what ? " she yelled at me . Lula is a black woman with a Rubenesque body and a Vegas wardrobe that 's four sizes too small . She is a former ' ho , currently working as a file clerk for the office and a wheelman for me . . . when the mood strikes . Today , she was wearing big fake-fur Sasquatch boots , and her ass was packed intopoison-green spandex pants . Her pink sweatshirt had Love Goddess spelled out in sequins across her boobs . My wardrobe runs a lot more casual than Lula 's . I was wearing jeans and a long-sleeved knit shirt from the Gap . My feet were stuffed into knock-off Ugg boots , and I was bundled into a big quilted jacket . I have naturally curly brown hair that looks okay when I wear it shoulder length . When it 's short , the best you can say is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , hoping to boost my bravado . I had a favor to perform that I suspected was going to come back to haunt me . I grabbed my bag , wrenched the driver 's side door open , and angled myself out of the car . It was the end of February , and there was gloom as far as the eye could see . It was almost ten a.m. , but the streetlights were on , and visibility in the swirling snow was about six inches . A truck chugged past , throwing slush halfway up my leg , soaking my jeans , bringing out my trash mouth . Winter wonderland Jersey-style . Connie Rosolli looked around her computer at me when I walked into the office . Connie is Vinnie 's office manager and his first line of defense against the stream of pissed-off bondees , bookies , hookers , various bill collectors , and stiffed smut peddlers hoping to reach Vinnie 's inner sanctum . Connie was a couple years older than me , a couple pounds heavier , a couple inches shorter , a couple cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Connie was pretty in a kick-ass , central Jersey , third-generation Italian kind of way . " I have three new skips , " Connie said . " One of them is Simon Diggery again . " Skips are people who fail to show for a court appearance after Vinnie has bonded them out of jail . Vinnie loses money when bondees fail to appear , so that 's where I come in . I work for Vinnie as a fugitive apprehension agent , better known as bounty hunter , and my job is to find the skips and drag them back into the system . " Do n't look to me to help you out with Simon Diggery , " Lula said , plunking herself down on the brown Naugahyde couch , picking up her copy of Star magazine . " Been there , done that . Not doing it again . No way . " " He 's an easy catch , " I said . " We know exactly where to find him . " " There 's no we ' gon na happen . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet Jesus , sitting in some bone orchard in the dead of night , waiting for Simon Diggery to show up . " Diggery was , among other things , a professional grave robber , relieving the recently deceased of rings , watches , and the occasional Brooks Brothers suit if it was Diggery 's size . Last time Diggery was in violation of his bond , Lula and I caught him hacksawing a cocktail ring off Miriam Lukach . We chased him all over the cemetery before I tackled him in front of the crematorium . I took the three new files from Connie and shoved them into my shoulder bag . " I 'm off . " " Where you going ? " Lula wanted to know . " It 's almost lunchtime . I do n't suppose you 're gon na be passing by some place I could get a meatball sub . I could use a meatball sub on a nasty day like this . " " I 'm going downtown , " I told her . " I need to talk to Dickie . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did I hear you right ? Is this the Dickie that called the police on you last time you were in his office ? Is this the Dickie you told to go fuck hisself ? Is this the Dickie you were married to for fifteen minutes in another life ? " " Yep . That 's the Dickie . " Lula grabbed her coat and scarf from the chair . " I 'll ride with you . I got ta see this . Hell , I do n't even care about the meatball sub anymore . " " Okay , but we 're not making a scene , " I said to Lula . " I need to talk to Dickie about a legal issue . This is going to be non-confrontational . " " I know that . Non-confrontational . Like two civilized people . " " Hold on . I 'm going too , " Connie said , getting her purse from her bottom desk drawer . " I do n't want to miss this . I 'll close the office for a couple hours for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told her . " Sure , but I 'm packin ' just in case it gets ugly , " Connie said . " Me too , " Lula said . " It is n't diamonds that 's a girl 's best friend . It 's a .9mm Glock . " Connie and Lula looked at me . " What are you carrying ? " Connie asked . " A brand-new can of hairspray and this lip gloss I 've got on . " " It 's a pretty good lip gloss , " Lula said , " but it would n't hurt to have a piece as a backup . " Connie stuffed herself into her coat . " I ca n't imagine what legal problem you 'd want to discuss with Dickie , but it must be a bitch to get you out in this weather . " " It 's sort of personal , " I said , relying on the one really decent bounty hunter skill I possessed . . . the ability to fib . " It dates back to when we were married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We all went head-down into the cold . Connie locked the office door , and we got into Lula 's red Firebird . Lula cranked the engine over , hip-hop blasted out of the CD player , and Lula motored off . " Is Dickie still downtown ? " Lula wanted to know . " Yes , but he 's in a new office . 3240 Brian Place . His firm is Petiak , Smullen , Gorvich , and Orr . " Lula cruised down Hamilton and turned onto North Broad . The wind had cut back , and it was no longer snowing , but there was still a thick cloud cover overhead . At best , the weather could now be described as grim . I was silently rehearsing my fake speech about how I needed information for an audit . And I was making promises to myself as performance incentive . I was seeing macaroni and cheese in my near future . Butterscotch Tastykakes . Onion rings . Snickers bars . Okay , so this had all the makings of a cluster fuck , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . Lula took a left at Brian and found a parking place half a block from Dickie 's office building . " I 'm gon na smack you on the head if you do n't stop cracking your knuckles , " Lula said to me . " You got ta chill . You need some tax information , and he 's got ta give it to you . " Lula cut her eyes to me . " That 's all there is to it , right ? " " Pretty much . " " Uh oh , " Lula said . " There 's more , is n't there ? " We all got out of the Firebird and stood huddled against the cold . " Actually , I have to plant a couple bugs on him for Ranger , " I told Lula . There it was , out in the open , swinging in the breeze . . . the favor from hell . Carlos Manoso goes by the street name Ranger . He 's my friend , my bounty hunter mentor , and in this case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American with dark skin and dark eyes and dark brown hair recently cut short . He 's half a head taller than I am , and two months older . I 've seen him naked , and when I say every part of him is perfect you can take it to the bank . He was Special Forces , and while he 's no longer military , he 's still got the skills and the muscle . He owns a security company named RangeMan now . Plus , he does the high-bond skips for Vinnie . He 's a hot guy , and there are strong feelings between us , but I try to keep some distance . Ranger plays by his own set of rules , and I do n't have a complete copy . " I knew it ! " Lula said . " I knew this would be good . " " You need something better than taxes , " Connie said . " You 're going to need a diversion if you want to plant bugs . " " Yeah , " Lula said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hustle and bustle . " " How about if we say we want to start a business together , " Connie said . " And we need advice on permits and partnership agreements . " " What kind of business we got ? " Lula asked . " I got ta know what I 'm getting into with you . " " It 's not a real business , " Connie said . " We 're just pretending . " " I still got ta know , " Lula said . " I 'm not putting my good name on just any old thing . " " For crissake , " Connie said , flapping her arms and stamping her feet to keep warm . " It could be anything . We could cater parties . " " Yeah , that 's believable , " Lula said . " On account of we 're all such gourmet cooks . The only time I turn my oven on is to heat up my apartment . And Stephanie probably do n't even know where her oven is . " " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dog walking-or we could buy a shrimp boat ? " Connie offered . " I like the limo idea , " Lula said . " We could buy a Lincoln and dress up in bad-ass uniforms . Something with some bling . " " It 's okay with me , " Connie said . I nodded and pulled my scarf up over my nose . " Me too . Let 's go inside . I 'm freezing . " " Wait , " Lula said . " We need a name . You ca n't have a limo company without a name . " " Lucky Limos , " Connie said . " The hell , " Lula said . " I 'm not joining up with a limo company 's got a lame name like that . " " Then you name it , " Connie said to Lula . " I do n't give a fig what the friggin ' company is called . My feet are numb . " " It should be something that reflects on us , " Lula said . " Like The Bitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one 's going to hire a limo from a company with a name like that , " Connie said . " I know some people , " Lula said . " Lovely Limos , Lonely Limos , Loser Limos , Lumpy Limos , Looney Limos , La De Da Limos , Limos for Liars , Lampshade Limos , Landfill Limos , Leaky Limos , Lemon Limos , Long Limos , Large Limos , Lazy Limos , Loosey Goosey Limos , " I said . Connie looked at me and grimaced . " Maybe it should be called Lula 's Limos , " I said . " Yeah , that got a ring to it , " Lula said . " Then it 's a deal . Lula 's Limos . " " Deal , " Connie said . " Get out of my way , so I can get inside and defrost . " We all pushed through the front door to Dickie 's building and stood in the foyer , sopping up the sudden blast of heat . The foyer opened to a reception area , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anyone had recognized me from my last visit , they would have immediately called for security . " Let me do the talking , " I said to Lula . " Sure , " Lula said . " I 'll be quiet as a mouse . I 'll zip my lip . " I approached the desk and made an attempt at demure . " We 'd like to see Mr. Orr , " I told the woman . " Do you have an appointment ? " " No , " I said . " I 'm terribly sorry to drop in like this , but we 're starting a new business , and we need some legal advice . We were down the street looking at real estate and thought we 'd take a chance that Mr. Orr might have a moment for us . " " Of course , " the woman said . " Let me see if he 's available . The name ? " " Capital City Limos . " " Hunh , " Lula said behind me . The woman buzzed Dickie and relayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He has a few minutes between appointments . You can take the elevator to your left . Second floor . " We all moved into the elevator , and I pushed the button for the second floor . " What was that ? " Lula wanted to know . " Capital City Limos ? " " It just popped out , but it sounds classy , right ? " " Not as classy as Lula 's Limos , " Lula said . " I 'd call Lula 's Limos any day of the week over Capital City Limos . Capital City Limos sounds like it got a stick up its ass , but you 'd be in for a good time in Lula 's Limos . " The door opened , and we spilled out of the elevator into another reception room with another new face at the desk . " Mr. Orr is expecting you , " the woman said . " His office is at the end of the corridor . " I led the parade in a sedate march to Dickie 's office . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and smiled . Friendly . Non-threatening . Dickie looked up and gasped . He ? s wearing glasses . He was dressed in a white shirt , red and blue striped tie , and dark blue suit . I 'd thought he was handsome when I married him , and he was still a nice-looking guy , in a corporate sort of way . But he felt soft compared to Joe Morelli and Ranger , the two men who were currently in my life . Dickie lacked the heat and raw male energy that surrounded Morelli and Ranger . And of course , I now knew Dickie was an asshole . " No need for alarm , " I said calmly . " I 'm here as a client . I needed a lawyer , and I thought of you . " " Lucky me , " Dickie said . I felt my eyes involuntarily narrow and did some mental deep breathing . " Lula and Connie and I are thinking about starting a limo service , " I said to Dickie . " You bet your ass , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And ? " Dickie said . " We do n't know anything about starting a business , " I said . " Do we need some sort of partnership agreement ? Do we need a business license ? Should we incorporate ? " Dickie slid a piece of paper across his desk . " Here are the law firm rates for services . " " Wow , " I said , looking at the rates . " This is a lot of money . I do n't know if we can afford you . " " Again , lucky me . " I felt my blood pressure edge up a notch . I planted my hands on my hips and glared down at him . " Am I to assume you would rather not have us as clients ? " " Let me think about that for a nanosecond , " Dickie said . " Yes ! Last time you were in my office you tried to kill me . " " That 's an exaggeration . Maim you , yes . Kill you , probably not . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Keep your day jobs . The three of you in business will be a disaster , and if you last long enough to go into menopause as business partners , you 'll turn into cannibals . " " Did I just get insulted ? " Lula asked . Okay , so he 's a jerk , I said to myself . That does n't change the mission . You have to keep your eye on the prize . You need to be cordial and find a way to plant the bugs . Hard to do when Dickie was in his chair behind the desk , and I was standing in front of it . " You 're probably right , " I said to Dickie . I looked around and moved to the mahogany shelves that lined one wall . Law books interspersed with personal flotsam . Photographs , awards , a couple carved-wood ducks , some art glass . " You have a wonderful office , " I told him . I went from photograph to photograph . A picture of Dickie with his brother . A picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his grandparents . A picture of Dickie graduating from college . A picture of Dickie on some ski slope . No pictures of Dickie 's ex-wife . I 'd inched my way along his wall , and I was now slightly behind him . I cleverly turned to admire the handsome desk set . . . and that was when I saw it . A picture of Dickie and Joyce Barnhardt . Dickie had his arm around Joyce , and they were laughing . And I knew it was recent because Dickie 's forehead was unusually high in the photograph . I sucked in some air and told myself to stay calm , but I could feel pressure building in my fingertips , and I worried my scalp might be on fire . " Uh oh , " Lula said , watching me . " Is that J-J-Joyce ? " I asked Dickie . " Yeah , " Dickie said . " We 've reconnected . I had a thing with her a bunch of years ago , and I guess I never got over the attraction . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you porking that pig on my dining room table fifteen minutes before I filed for divorce , you scum-sucking , dog-fucking lump of goose shit . " Joyce Barnhardt had been a fat , buck-toothed , sneaky little kid who spread rumors , picked at emotional wounds , spit on my dessert at lunchtime , and made my school years a nightmare . By the time she was twenty , the fat had all gone to the right places . She dyed her hair red , had her breasts enlarged and her lips plumped , and she set out on her chosen career of home wrecker and gold digger . Looking back on it all , I had to admit Joyce had done me a favor by being the catalyst to get me out of my marriage to Dickie . That did n't alter the fact that Joyce will never be my favorite person , though . " That 's right , " Dickie said . " Now I remember . I thought I could finish up before you got home , but you came home early . " And next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his neck . He was yelling as best he could , considering I was choking him , and Lula and Connie were in the mix . By the time Lula and Connie wrestled me off him , the room was filled with clerical staff . Dickie dragged himself up and looked at me wild-eyed . " You 're all witnesses , " he said to the roomful of people . " She tried to kill me . She 's insane . She should be locked up in a looney bin . Call the police . Call animal control . Call my lawyer . I want a restraining order . " " You deserve Joyce , " I said to Dickie . " What you do n't deserve is this desk clock . It was a wedding present from my Aunt Tootsie . " And I took the clock , turned on my heel , tipped my nose up ever so slightly , and flounced out of his office , Connie and Lula right behind me . Dickie scrambled after us . " Give me that clock ! That 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at Dickie 's nose . " Were you paying attention ? Her Aunt Tootsie gave her that clock . Now get your little runt ass back in your office and close the door before I put a big hole in your head . " We took the stairs for fear the elevator might be too slow , barreled out the front door , and speed-walked down the block before the police could show up and haul me off to the clink . I saw the shiny black SUV parked across the street . Tinted windows . Motor running . I paused and gave the car a thumbs-up , and the lights flashed at me . Ranger was listening to the bugs I 'd just left in Dickie 's pockets . We rammed ourselves into Lula 's Firebird , and Lula rocketed the car away from the curb . " I swear , I thought you were gon na burst into flames when you saw that picture of Dickhead and Joyce , " Lula said . " It was like you had those glowing demon eyes you see in horror movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , but then a calm came over me , " I said . " And I saw I had a chance to plant the bugs in Dickie 's pockets . " " The calm must have come while you were squeezing his neck and banging his head against the floor , " Connie said . I blew out a sigh . " Yep . That was about the time . " We had food spread all over Connie 's desk . Meatball subs in wax paper wrappers , a big tub of coleslaw , potato chips , pickles , and diet sodas . " This was a good idea , " I said to Lula . " I was starved . " " Guess going apeshit makes you hungry , " Lula said . " What 's up next ? " " I thought I 'd do some phone work on Simon Diggery . Maybe I can get a lead on him that 'll take me someplace other than a graveyard . " Diggery was a wiry little guy in his early fifties . His brown hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His skin looked like old leather . And he had arms like Popeye from years of hauling dirt . Most often , he worked alone , but on occasion he could be seen walking the streets at two in the morning with his brother Melvin , shovels on their shoulders like Army rifles . " You 're not going to get anywhere with phone calls , " Lula said . " Those Diggerys are wily . " I pulled a previous file on Diggery and copied phone numbers and places of employment . In the past , Diggery had delivered pizzas , bagged groceries , pumped gas , and cleaned kennel cages . " It 's a place to start , " I said to Lula . " Better than knocking on their doors . " The Diggerys all lived together in a raggedy double-wide in Bordentown . Simon , Melvin , Melvin 's wife , Melvin 's six kids , Melvin 's pet python , and Uncle Bill Diggery . If you knocked on the door to the double-wide , you 'd only find the python . The Diggerys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home the minute a car stopped in the driveway . When the weather was especially bad and the ground was frozen , grave robbing was slow work and Simon would sometimes take odd jobs . I was hoping to catch him at one of those jobs . Since the jobs were random , the only way to learn of them was to trick a family member or neighbor into giving Simon up . " What 's the charge this time ? " Lula asked . I paged through the file . " Drunk and disorderly , destruction of private property , attempted assault . " Everyone knew Diggery was Trenton 's premier grave robber , but his arrests were seldom associated with desecration of the dead . He was most often arrested for disorderly conduct and assault . When Simon Diggery got drunk , he swung a mean shovel . I gathered my information together and stuffed it into my bag along with the clock . " I 'm working at home for the rest of the day . " " I feel like working at home until July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this weather . " I 'd just gotten into my car when my mom called on my cell . " Where are you ? " she wanted to know . " Are you at the bail bonds office ? " " I was just leaving . " " I was wondering if you would stop at Giovichinni 's for me on your way home . Your father is out in the taxi all day , and my car wo n't start . I think I need a new battery . I want a half-pound of liverwurst , a half-pound of ham , a half-pound of olive loaf , and a half-pound of turkey . Then you can get me some Swiss cheese and some good rye . And a rump roast . And get an Entenmann 's . Your grandmother likes the raspberry coffee cake . " " Sure , " I said . " I 'm on my way . " The bail bonds office sits with its back to downtown Trenton and its front to a small ethnic neighborhood known as the Burg . I was born and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burg limits , I 'm still tethered to it by family and history . Once a Burgerbit , always a Burgerbit . Giovichinni 's is a small family-owned deli a short distance down on Hamilton , and it 's the Burg deli of choice . It 's also a hotbed of gossip , and I was certain news of my rampage was circulating through every corner of the Burg , including Giovichinni 's . I was currently driving a burgundy Crown Vic that used to be a cop car . I 'd needed a car fast , and this was the only car I could afford at Crazy Iggy 's Used Car Emporium . I promised myself the Vic was temporary , put it in gear , and motored to Giovichinni 's . I hurried through the store , head down , all business , hoping no one would mention Dickie . I walked away from the butcher unscathed , rushed past Mrs. Landau and Mrs. Ruiz without saying hello , and I stood in line at the checkout behind Mrs. Martinelli . Thank goodness , she did n't speak English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had run out . Lucy Giovichinni was at the register . " I hear you trashed your ex 's office this morning , " Lucy said , checking my groceries . " Is it true you threatened to kill him ? " " No ! I was there with Lula and Connie . We had some legal issues we wanted to run by him . Honestly , I do n't know how these rumors get started . " And this was only the beginning . I could see it coming . This was going to turn into a disaster of biblical proportions . I carried my bags to the Vic , loaded them into the trunk along with Aunt Tootsie 's desk clock , and got behind the wheel . By the time I reached my parent 's house , sleet was slanting onto the windshield . I parked in the driveway and dragged the bags to the front door , where my Grandma Mazur was waiting . Grandma Mazur came to live with my parents when my Grandpa Mazur bypassed the FDA and took his trans-fat needs to a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grandma asked . " Yep . I got the coffee cake . " I slid past her and carried everything to the kitchen , where my mother was ironing . " How long has she been ironing ? " I asked Grandma . " She 's been at it for about twenty minutes . Ever since the call came in about you sending Dickie to the hospital and then eluding the police . " My mother ironed when she was stressed . Sometimes she ironed the same shirt for hours . " I did n't send Dickie to the hospital . And there were no police involved . " At least none that I ran across . " Lula and Connie and I went to Dickie for some legal advice and somehow these rumors got started . " My mother stopped ironing and set the iron on end . " I never hear rumors about Miriam Zowicki 's daughter , or Esther Marchese 's daughter , or Elaine Rosenbach 's daughter . Why are there always rumors about my daughter ? " I cut myself a slice of coffee cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my jeans pockets to keep from eating the whole cake . Grandma was stowing the food in the fridge . " Stephanie and me are just colorful people , so we get talked about a lot . Look at all the crazy things they say about me . I swear , people will say anything . "
