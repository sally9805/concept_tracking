I WAS BORN on the side of a steep hill in the summer of 1954 . My father was a farmer , my mother his helper . Our house was made of mud and sticks . We were about a mile away from the nearest village . The first world I can remember was green and bright , full of cooking fires and sisters murmuring and drying sorghum and corn leaves in the wind and the warm arms of my mother . // Our house had three rooms . There were small windows with pieces of hinged wood to keep out the sun and rain . The house was built on an incline of terraced farms , but the small yard outside was flat . My mother kept it swept clean of seedpods and leaves with a homemade broom made out of bundled twigs . When I grew old enough she would let me help her . I still remember the happiness I felt on the day when she trusted me to do it by myself . // From the courtyard you could look south across the winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome distance , like looking into another country . The hill was laced , as ours was , with houses made out of mud and stucco and baked red tiles , dots of cattle grazing , the groves of avocado plants , and the paddlewide leaves of the banana trees that practically sparkled in the sun . On a perfect day you could lie in the grass near our home and see people at work in the fields on the next hill . They looked like ants . Every now and then somebody 's machete would catch the angle of the sun and you 'd see the winking of metal across the valley . And far , far in the distance you could make out the clustered roofs of the village called Gitwe , where my parents told me I would one day learn how to read and write , which neither of them could do . // We spoke the beautiful language of Kinyarwanda , in which I first learned the names of the world 's many things in rich deep vowels made in the back of the mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amabuye . Milk , amata . // To enter our house through the front door you had to step up on a stoop made of gray rocks . It could n't have been more than two feet off the courtyard , but it seemed like a towering height . I used to climb in on my hands and knees . To the side of the door was a flat stone used for sharpening machetes . There was a shallow depression in the middle where rainwater would collect . After a storm I would splash my hands around in the cool water , putting it on my face and letting it dribble down my cheeks . It was the best part of the rain . When those storms came in September the lightning and thunder scared me . My three younger brothers and I would sometimes huddle together during the worst ones . And then we would laugh at each other for our cowardice . Thunder , inkuba . // My parents raised nine children altogether , and I was an island in time 's river , separated by six years from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got a lot of attention from my mother as a result , and trailed her around the house hoping she would reward me with a chore . The firmament of our relationship was work ; we expressed love to one another in the thousands of little daily actions that kept a rural African family together . She showed me how to take care of the baby goats and cows , and how to grind cassava into flour . Even when I came back to visit my parents when I was grown it would be only minutes before I would find myself holding an empty jerrican and going to fetch well water for my mother . // There was a narrow path from the main road that twisted up the side of the ridge and passed through groves of banana trees . I had learned how to walk on this path . It was our connection with a small village called Nkomero , which occupies the top of one of the hundreds of thousands of hills in Rwanda . The nickname for my country is " the land of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this signifies a gross undercount . There are at least half a million hills , maybe more . If geography creates culture , then the Rwandan mind is shaped like solid green waves . We are the children of the hills , the grassy slopes , the valley roads , the spider patterns of rivers , and the millions of rivulets and crevasses and buckles of earth that ripple across this part of Central Africa like the lines on the tired face of an elder . If you ironed Rwanda flat , goes the joke , it would be ten times as big . In this country we do n't talk about coming from a particular village , but a particular hill . We had to learn the hard way how to arrange our plots of corn and cabbage into flat terraces on the sloping ground so as not to turn a farm into an avalanche . Every inch of arable land is used this way . The daily walk up to a family grove can be an exercise in calf-straining misery going up , and in thigh-wracking caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most muscular on the African continent . // There is a story about the conqueror of Mexico , Hernon Cort ? s , who was asked by the king of Spain to describe the topography of the rugged new nation . Cort ? s reached for the map on the table and crumpled it up into a ball . " That , " he said , " is what Mexico looks like . " He could just as easily have been talking about Rwanda . If you did n't grow up here you would be likely to get very , very lost among those seductive hills and valleys . // Our family had rows of sorghum and bananas planted on the slopes of two hills , which made us solidly middle class by the standards of rural Africa in the 1950s . We would have been considered quite poor , of course , when viewed through the lens of a European nation , but it was all we knew and there was always plenty to eat . We worked hard and I grew up without shoes . But we laughed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family before I knew the word for it . // I think the greatest hero in my life was my father , Thomas Rupfure . He was already an old man , well into his sixties , when I was a child , and he seemed impossibly tall and strong . I could not comprehend that I could one day be his age , or that he was once mine . I assumed he had always been old . // I never once heard him raise his voice . He did n't need to . He always spoke without apology or flourish and with a calm self-possession . If he and my mother ever fought I never knew it . On special days he would fold my hand into his and take me up the winding path to the top of the hill , and then down the rutted road that led to the village , where we would go to buy sweet potatoes or bags of corn . We walked past the houses of our neighbors , and he would greet each one with a gentle nod . Anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long story . He loved to talk in proverbs . It was the way he understood the world and his favorite way of dispensing wisdom . Here 's an example : Somebody might tell him a story about being taxed at too high a rate by the mayor , and he would start talking about a lamb and a dog drinking out of the same river . The dog accused the lamb of dirtying his water , but the lamb pointed out that that was impossible , since the dog was upstream . The dog then said that the lamb must have dirtied the water yesterday , and the lamb pointed out that that was also impossible , because he had not been in the meadows yesterday . Then it must have been your brother ! , said the dog , and he proceeded to devour the lamb . The moral of the story was that any excuse will serve a tyrant . I would have cause to remember that tale much later in life . // There was not much to our village of Nkomero , then or today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town hall . There is a small Roman Catholic church . There are a few stores that sell bags of sugar , salt , and soft drinks . There is a tavern where men lounge and drink the potent beer made from bananas . A car or a truck coming through was a big event . Behind the wheel , very often , was a white man-a European missionary or a doctor . Muzungu ! the children would call , a word that means " white man , " and they would say it with relish . It was not meant as an insulting word , just a descriptive one , and the white people would smile back at us . We were always hoping for a toss of candy or a ballpoint pen , which would sometimes come and sometimes not . // The road wound past the church and the tavern and on along the ridgetop through a grove of eucalyptus trees on the other side of the Ruvayaga Valley , tracing a long horseshoe shape all the way to the next village , Gitwe . I would walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so many times that I could practically do it blindfolded , knowing where the road turned just by counting the number of steps I had taken . It was an important symbol in my life , this rutted track that connected my home with my school . It was where I first understood that in order to make progress as a man you had to take a journey . There was only so much you could learn at home before you had to get out in the world and prove what you could do . // It was my father who first took me down this road to the school at Gitwe when I was eight years old , and I still remember him handing me off to the assistant principal and saying good-bye . I suppose it should have been a troubling moment for me-it was the first time I was leaving my parents ' care-but I was eager to begin the adventure of learning . My father had told me over and over again : " If you are willing to do it , you will be successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had and I know now that he was sending a little piece of himself with me that day . // Perhaps it had something to do with growing up with such a large family , but I found that I could get on well with the new kids in my school . We played soccer , of course , and racing games to see who could run the fastest . Another game was a variation of capture the flag in which the idea was to venture inside enemy territory and grab one of their sticks without being caught . // One strange game I remember in particular was called igihango , which is a word loosely translated in English as " trust . " There were no clearly defined rules to this game , and I 'm not sure you could even call it a game in the classic sense of the word . The idea was that you made a secret agreement to be friends with a particular kid , only you were n't supposed to tell anybody else about it . Other kids tried to make you confess your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the ribs or whatever other kind of boyish sadism they could dream up . I was always very good about keeping my igihango confidences to myself , at least verbally , but I think I always exposed them when I ran to save one or another of my secret allies from being interrogated . I probably should have been more subtle . // When I went home from school in the evenings I would help my mother cook supper . My brothers and I used hoes to carve out brick-shaped pieces of dirt and we built a kind of domed oven out of them . We stuffed a bunch of sweet potatoes inside and then lit a small fire underneath them . They came out charred and delicious . Every oven was used only once . We kicked it back into the ground , so as to bury the ashes , and then built a new one the next night . // Our suppers always came with small tastes of a bitter and delicious beer made out of the juice of bananas . Let me tell you about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always complain that it tastes like spoiled buttermilk , but I think it is tasty . It plays a central role in Rwandan social life , and is also an important symbol of the good-heartedness and collegiality that I think represents the best side of my country . There is a saying : " You never invite a man without a beer . " It is the symbol of hospitality , a way of saying without words , " You are my friend and I can relax in your presence . " // Brewing banana beer is like the art of friendship : simple and very complicated at once . First you dig a pit in the earth . Because Rwanda is just a few miles below the equator , the ground temperature is always warm . It acts like a very slow , gentle oven for the fermentation . You take a bunch of ripe bananas , as many as you want , and bury them about four feet deep . You make a lid for the pit out of the broad leaves of the banana tree . Come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very overripe . You transfer the mushy fruit to a basin made out of a hollowed tree trunk and then press down on them using handfuls of tough grass as your gloves . You drain out the juice into a clay pot , strain out the chunks , mix it with sorghum flour as a fermenting agent , let it sit for about a month , and then you have your banana beer . // It is a simple recipe , but it takes years of practice to get it right . You have to feel your way around and make mistakes . This is normal . We have all tasted bad beer . Sometimes the banana juice comes out too light and you have to put it over a fire to reduce the quantity . Sometimes the juice comes out too potent and you have to add water . Almost every house in Rwanda has a yellow plastic jug of banana beer tucked somewhere on the premises . It is like a mailbox in America or a teapot in England ; everyone has to have one . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendship that it cements . Everywhere in my country you see people talking and laughing over bottles of banana beer . It most often happens at what we call cabarets , which are an indispensable part of life in rural Africa . They are like a bar and a convenience store combined , sometimes made of nothing but a few planks of wood . You see them on the sides of roads , in the suburbs , and even in the smallest little villages . Here you can buy canned goods , soap , soft drinks , batteries , toys , and all kinds of other things . The most important part of the cabaret is the front , where the owner has set out chairs , benches , and maybe even an old , ratty couch . This is where the local people , no matter what their station in life , will come together for a round of banana beer , often sipped through the same red straw . It is very hard to hate someone with whom you have shared a beer . There is too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be predisposed to be enemies will come together over a beer . // Perhaps this simple act taps into something in our national memory . Banana beer is known as " the drink of reconciliation . " It plays an important role in our traditional local court system , known in the Kinyarwandan language as gacaca , or as it is loosely translated , " justice on the grass . " If somebody had a problem with a neighbor he would not seek revenge . He instead brought it to the attention of a group of men who we called elders . They were not elected in the classical sense of ballots , but they were put in a position of leadership by a kind of unspoken common assent . To be an elder you had to have a reputation for fairness and sober judgment , something that would only become apparent over time . It was apparent in the way you lived your life . Hard-liners and loudmouths did not get to be elders . // The elders would invite the village to come sit under the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost all of the disputes concerned property . A stolen goat , for instance , or somebody trying to grow crops on a hill that belonged to another family . More serious cases-such as those involving violence-were always referred to the courts , but village elders were given wide latitude to help solve local problems . // After the two enemies had finished speaking , the elders would give their opinions , one by one , on what should be done to remedy the problem . It usually involved compensation . A typical punishment for a stolen goat would be to repay the man a goat-and then give him another as a fine . Somebody bringing a charge thought to be false would be ordered to pay the man he had slandered . Confession was always the key . The village put a high value on the act of admitting culpability , even if you were the one bringing the case . It was viewed as a necessary step in the process of absolution . A man who lied before the entire village knew that he would have to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous incentive to come clean , and very little penalty was meted out for being honest with the public , and with yourself . // Then came the most important part of justice on the grass : The two aggrieved men were required to share a gourd of banana beer as a sign of renewed friendship . There were usually no lasting scars because it was hard to stay angry at someone who had humbled himself before you . The adversarial system of justice practiced in the West often fails to satisfy us , I am convinced , because it does not offer warring parties the opportunity to be human with each other at the end . Whether you were the victim or the aggressor you had to strip yourself of pride and recognize the basic humanity of the fellow with whom you were now sharing a banana beer . There was public shame in this system , true , but also a display of mutual respect that closed the circle . Everyone who showed up to hear the case was invited to sip the banana beer too , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . It was like a secular communion . The lasting message for all that gathered there was that solutions could always be found inside-inside communities and inside people . //
