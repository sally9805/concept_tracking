<p> This good-looking young woman named Coretta got a phone call . A guy she 'd never met , never heard of , was on the other end , asking for a date . He said he got her name from a mutual friend . <p> Coretta listened as the man tried to sweet-talk her . He was smooth and cocky . In Coretta 's words , he was spouting " intellectual jive . " Mildly intrigued by his blind confidence , she agreed to a date . <p> When he came to pick her up , her first thoughts were , " How short he seems , " and , " How unimpressive he looks . " <p> He came on strong , too . He told Coretta she had the four traits he wanted in a wife : character , intelligence , personality and beauty . She was taken aback : " He literally proposed to me on that first date . " <p> She could have dismissed him , based on her first impressions . But she sat with him into the night . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sincere . Captivating . As he spoke , Coretta decided , " he grew in stature . " <p> Years later , when Coretta Scott King told me this story during an interview , I was taken with the image of Martin Luther King Jr . as an audacious young man pitching woo on a blind date . That 's not how we think of him . Nor do we picture an eye-rolling young Coretta having reservations about dating him . But she did . And in her story , we can see pieces of our own romantic lives . <p> It 's so easy to reject people based on first impressions . They 're too tall , too loud , too weird , too whatever . But what happens when you give an awful first date a second chance ? For Valentine 's Day , I asked readers to share stories of " when bad first impressions turned good . " By the hundreds , they told tales of lousy first encounters that led to happily ever afters . <p> Want to have hope that love can strike after dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ?

" Lou must have watched too many cop shows , because he was one tough safety . He hauled Lupe into the principal 's office for not obeying his direct orders . She was so mad at him for getting her in trouble , she refused to look at him for three years . <p> But in seventh grade , Lupe glanced his way and noticed a new Lou . " He was n't short and fat anymore . He was so cute . " They 've been a couple ever since . After 25 years of marriage , Lupe , from Gary , Ind. , says , " I can tell your readers that a bad first impression can lead to the only love of your life . " <p> If a first date makes you see red : Lots of readers told of getting into huge spats on first dates : " He made me cringe ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw red . This guy named Allan asked her to a Valentine 's dance and picked her up in his dad 's car . " When he opened the car door , I noticed towels covering the seats , " Faith says . " There was also a peculiar odor . I was glad to arrive at the dance hall . " <p> As she entered the dance , people stared at her , gasping . She soon discovered that the back of her new dress was stained blood-red . Horrified , she ran out of the building , crying . Allan caught up to her and explained that his parents owned a butcher shop . He 'd delivered meat earlier in the day , had placed the towels strategically , but the blood had obviously soaked through . " We had a big argument , " says Allan . " I apologized , but I got the impression she 'd never see me again . " <p> What did he do ? " I took her to dinner , charmed her with flowers , candlelight . Things worked out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of River Grove , have been married 41 years . <p> Let a smile be your umbrella : As a student at Illinois State in 1980 , Sean Lamb lived with roommates on the top floor of a three-story apartment building . They held a housewarming party , and 100 friends showed up . " The line for our washroom <p> was 15 people long , " Sean says . " Mother <p> Nature was calling , and I could n't <p> wait . " <p> He went on his back balcony , which overlooked a desolate wooded area . Assuming no one would notice if he stood at the balcony 's edge , he answered Mother Nature 's call . <p> But screams from below quickly caught his attention . Turned out , two girls in the ground-floor apartment were on their back patio , having a quiet barbecue . Sean had ruined their dinner . <p> " I flew down the stairs to apologize , " he says . " It was a horrible situation . " <p> That 's when he met Renee . Despite her shock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sean ordered pizza to replace the girls ' dinner and invited them to his party . Renee and Sean now live in Homewood . They 've been married 17 years . <p> " We have two great kids , ages 3 and 1 , " says Sean , " and we wonder what we 'll tell them when they ask , ' How 'd you two meet ? ' " <p> Make no rules : Dozens of readers said they found love by fighting their first impression that someone " was n't my type . " <p> Jennifer Stevens of Niles said she met a nerdy guy named Mel at a bowling alley . " He laughed too hard at my jokes , followed me like a puppy all night , and had the bartender overload my drinks with maraschino cherries when I told him I liked them . He was , in my opinion , a total geek . " She always thought she wanted some cool " rebel , " but after giving Mel another chance , she discovered that " the things that turned me off that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's loyal , considerate and makes me feel like a queen . " They 've been married 10 years . " I 'm thankful I did n't let a stupid first impression stand in our way . " <p> Clothes do n't make the man : The first time Rita Samuelson saw Al , in 1977 , he was on a bench at Indiana University waiting for their blind date . He wore brown jeans . Brown ? What a turnoff ! Even in the ' 70s , brown jeans were seriously nerdy . <p> The first date was a bust . " But , " says Rita , " when he called a couple months later , I decided to give him a second chance . We 've now been married 22 years . " <p> The Bloomingdale couple recently took their two daughters to Indiana to see the spot where they met . " The bench had been replaced by an ATM machine , " Rita says . And standing there , Al finally revealed his first impression of her . " He said he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers that I was wearing the day we met . " So there ! <p> Even drunks can have something to say : " I met my husband , Patrick , when he was totally loaded at a bar , " says Brenda Glenn of Morton Grove . " He was slurring his words , could barely walk during frequent trips to the bathroom , and kept calling me by the wrong name . " <p> And yet she enjoyed talking to him . " Because he 'd lost all ' manly inhibitions ' to booze , he freely discussed 18th century poetry , " Brenda says . " He knew all about Byron . He won my heart . <p> " When I finally agreed to give this drunk my number , he had to remember the first three digits , and his buddy remembered the last four . I 'm glad they tag-teamed . We 've been together eight years . " <p> Love means saying , " I 'm sorry " : Carolyn Israel was exiting a CTA bus when another rider stepped on her coat .

Nine years later , the Chicago couple are married with two children . <p> Gina Fernandez was in a convenience store and bumped into a man putting a lid on his coffee . The coffee spilled all over him . She apologized profusely . At first he was upset , but within minutes he was asking her out . The Cicero couple also have been married nine years . <p> Look beyond the body  --  into the soul : I once interviewed singer Kenny Loggins and his wife , Julia . They met when she became his " colonics instructor . " That means she 'd give him " cleansing " enemas . It 's hard for a man to be suave when he 's in that position . But eventually they fell in love . <p> Likewise , I heard from several readers who learned not to judge others by bodily functions alone . <p> At 17 , while working in a factory that made comforters , Barbara Mullins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " she says . " First , he had horrendous underarm odor . Secondly , he was extremely slow , which held me back from doing enough piecework to earn a bonus . I soon had him fired . " <p> A year later , she met him at a party , and he smelled much better . The May- <p> wood couple have been married 47 <p> years . <p> Be prepared to eat your words : When Brenda Kandall from Carol Stream began working at a plastics plant , she avoided co-worker Ron Klobertanz . " He always looked like he was mad at the world , " she says . She told the plant manager , " I 'd rather eat my pancreas than have to talk to him . " Ron heard she 'd said this and approached her one day to ask her out to lunch . " We can go to a restaurant that does n't serve pancreas , " he said sweetly . <p> They began dating , and he was by her side after she was diagnosed with cervical cancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she feels lucky she overcame her first impression of Ron . " I did n't want to go near him , but he turned out to be one of the most fabulous human beings in the world . " <p> Just wait . The right moment might come : All right , it 's my turn . <p> I met my wife at a small dinner party in 1982 , where we argued about the merits of newspapering ( my job ) vs . TV news ( she 's a TV anchorwoman ) . Yes , I recognized that she was smart , feisty and beautiful . But she sure did n't seem to like me , so I was n't too enamored of her . I kept a journal back then  --  often including such details as " shaved this morning " or " saw attractive woman at red light "  --  but I never even mentioned meeting Sherry . Not one word about her ! <p> I did n't see her again for three years . But in 1985 , the moment was right , the big news tiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . <p> If you 're nursing a bad first impression of someone this Valentine 's Day , do n't be married to it . Sometimes , it takes a second chance , a third sighting , or a fourth date for love to set in . Here 's hoping you 're open to the possibilities .
