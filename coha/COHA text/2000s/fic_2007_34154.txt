Chapter One If a man goes at his work with his fists he is not so successful as if he goes at it with his head . - Profitable Farming in the Southern States , 1890 Deborah Knott Friday , February 24 A cold February morning and the first thing on my calendar was the State of North Carolina versus James Braswell and Hector Macedo . Misdemeanor assault inflicting serious bodily injury . I vaguely remembered doing first appearances on them both two or three weeks earlier although I would have heard only enough facts to set an appropriate bond and appoint attorneys if they could n't afford their own . According to the papers now before me , Braswell was a lineman for the local power company and could not only afford an attorney , but had also made bail immediately . His co-defendant , here on a legal visa , had needed an appointed lawyer and he had sat in the Colleton County jail for eleven days till someone went his bail . Each was charged with assaulting the other , and while it might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decided to join the two cases and prosecute them together since the charges rose out of the same brawl . Despite a broken bottle , our DA had not gone for the more serious charge of felony assault because keepingthem both misdemeanors would save his office time and the county money , something he was more conscious of now that he 'd decided to run for governor . Neither attorney had objected even though it meant they had to put themselves between the two men scowling at each other from opposite ends of the defendants ' table . Braswell 's left hand and wrist had been bandaged last month . Today , a scabby red line ran diagonally across the back of his hand and continued down along the outer edge of his wrist till it disappeared under the cuff of his jacket . The stitches had been removed , but the puncture marks on either side were still visible . I 'm no doctor , but it looked as if the jagged glass had barely missed the veins on the underside of Braswell 's wrist . The cut over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark eyebrow . I listened as Julie Walsh finished reading the charges . Doug 's newest ADA was a recent graduate of Campbell University 's law school over in Buies Creek . Small-boned , with light brown hair and blue-green eyes , she dressed like the perfectly conservative product of a conservative school except that a delicate tracery of tattooed flowers circled one thin white wrist and was almost unnoticeable beneath the leather band of her watch . Rumor said there was a Japanese symbol for trust at the nape of her neck but because she favored turtleneck sweaters and wore her long hair down , I could n't swear to that . " How do you plead ? " I asked the defendants . " Not guilty , " said Braswell . " Guilty with extenuating circumstances , " said Macedo through his attorney . While Walsh laid out the State 's case , I thought about the club where the incident took place . El Toro Negro . The name brought back a rush of mental images . I had been there twice myself . Last spring , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy as a sort of twelfth brother and a handy escort if both of us were at loose ends , a couple of court translators had invited me to a Cinco de Mayo fiesta at the club . My latest romance had gone sour the month before so I 'd asked Dwight if he wanted to join us . " Yeah , would n't hurt for me to take a look at that place , " he 'd said . " Maybe keep you out of trouble while I 'm at it . " Knowing that he likes to dance just as much as I do , I did n't rise to the bait . The club was so jammed that the party had spilled out into the cordoned-off parking lot . It felt as if every Hispanic in Colleton County had turned out . I had n't realized till then just how many there were-all those mostly ignored people who had filtered in around the fringes of our lives . Normally , they wear faded shirts and mud-stained jeans while working long hours in our fields or on construction jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver conchos and shiny belt buckles . The women who stake our tomatoes or pick up our sweet potatoes alongside their men in the fields or who wear the drab uniforms of fast-food chains as they wipe down tables or take our orders ? They came in colorful swirling skirts and white scoop-neck blouses bright with embroidery . We danced to the infectious music , drank Mexican beer from longnecked bottles , danced some more , then stuffed ourselves at the fast-food taqueras that lined the parking lot . I bought piatas for an upcoming family birthday party , and Dwight bought a hammered silver belt buckle for his young son . It was such a festive , fun evening that he and I went back again after we were engaged . The club was crowded and the music was okay , but it felt like ten men for every woman and when they began to hit on me , I had to get Dwight out of there before he arrested somebody . So I could picture the club 's interior as Walsh called her first witness to the stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt S , Macedo 's attorney asked that I allow a translator because his own client 's English was shaky . I agreed and Elena Smith took a seat directly behind Macedo , where she kept up a low-pitched , steady obligato to all that was said . " State your name and address . " The middle-aged witness twisted a billed cap in his callused hands as he gave his name and an address on the outskirts of Cotton Grove . His nails were as ragged and stained as his jeans . In English that was adequate , if heavily accented , he described how he 'd entered the restroom immediately after Hector Macedo . " Then that man " - here he pointed at Braswell- " he push me away and grab him- " " Mr. Macedo ? " the ADA prompted . " S. And he hit him and hit him . Many times . " " Did Mr. Macedo hit him back ? " " He try to get away , but that one too big . Too strong . " " Then what happened ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he let go and there is much blood . Then the bouncers come . And la polica . " " No further questions , Your Honor , " said the ADA . Braswell 's attorney declined to cross-examine the witness , but Macedo 's had him flesh out the narrative so as to make it clear to me that the smaller man had acted in self-defense when Braswell left him with no other options . A second witness took the stand and his account echoed the first . When Walsh started to call a third witness , Braswell 's attorney stood up . " We 're willing to stipulate as to the sequence of events , Your Honor , " whereupon the State rested . Macedo , a subcontractor for a drywall service , went first for the defense . Speaking through the interpreter , he swore to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . According to his testimony , he had been minding his own business when Braswell attacked him for no good reason . He did not even know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning by Braswell 's lawyer , he admitted that he was at the club that night with one Karen Braswell . Yes , that would be the other defendant 's ex-wife although he had not known it at the time . Besides , it was n't a real date . She worked with his sister at the Bojangles in Dobbs and the two women had made up a casual foursome with himself and a friend . He 'd had no clue that she had a husband who was still in the picture till the man began choking and pounding him . Macedo 's attorney called the sister , who sat in the first row behind her brother and strained to hear the translator , but Braswell 's attorney objected and I sustained . " Defense rests . " " Call your first witness , " I told Braswell 's attorney . " No witnesses , Your Honor . " " Mr. Braswell , " I said as his attorney nudged him to stand . " I find you guilty as charged . " " Your Honor , " said his attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my client 's natural distress at seeing his wife out with another man while he was still trying to save their marriage . " " I thought they were divorced , " I said . " In his mind they 're still married , Your Honor . " " Ms. Walsh ? " " Your Honor , I think it 's relevant that you should know Mr. Braswell was under a restraining order not to contact Mrs. Braswell or go near her . " " Is this true ? " I asked the man , who was now standing with his attorney . He gave a noncommittal shrug and there was a faint sneer on his lips . " Was a warrant issued for this violation ? " " Yes , Your Honor , but he made bail . He 's due in court next week . Judge Parker . " " What was the bail ? " " Five thousand . " I could have increased the bail , but it was moot . He was n't going to have an opportunity to hassle his ex before Luther Parker saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about it . " Ten days active time , " I told Braswell . " Bailiff , you will take the prisoner in custody . " " Now , wait just a damn minute here ! " he cried ; but before he could resist , the bailiff and a uniformed officer had him in a strong-arm grip and marched him out the door that would lead to the jail . Macedo stood beside his attorney and his face was impassive as he waited for me to pass judgment . I found him guilty of misdemeanor assault and because he 'd already sat in jail for eleven days , I reduced his sentence to time served and no fine , just court costs . He showed no emotion as the translator repeated my remarks in Spanish , but his sister 's smile was radiant . " Gracias , " she whispered to me as they headed out to the back hall to pay the clerk . " De nada , " I told her . " State versus Rasheed King , " said Julie Walsh , calling her next case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pugnacious young black man came to stand next to his lawyer at the defendant 's table . " How do you plead ? " " Hey , his truck bumped me first , Judge . " " Sorry , Your Honor , " said his attorney . " You 'll get a chance to tell your story , Mr. King , " I said , " but for our records , are you pleading guilty or not guilty ? " " Not guilty , ma'am . " It was going to be one of those days .
