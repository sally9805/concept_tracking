<p> ELIAN CONFLICT BORDERS ON INSURRECTION <p> Editor  --  I hope your lead editorial on April 13 will be just one of many in the days ahead , because it is only a start . The Elian Gonzalez story is not really about Elian , who is but a pawn in all this , but rather it is about the demonized Fidel Castro , the bone in this community 's throat . <p> The South Florida Cuban American community is composed of the remnants  --  plus assorted first- and second-generation relatives  --  of the Cuban oligarchy which gave birth to , maintained and nourished the regime of the dictator Fulgencio Batista , which in turn brought about the very revolution led by Fidel Castro . <p> It is long past time for U.S. politicos  --  politicos of every stripe , who have been cowed by this community , seduced by their money and by the hopes for their votes  --  to put an end to this nonsense , as well as to shameful , embarrassing legislation such as the Helms-Burton Act , and all assorted measures which prolong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The actions these past days in Miami have been actions not short of insurrection : " We will not hand over this boy , notwithstanding orders from the Justice Department . " What other community anywhere in this country , of any stripe , color , race , ethnicity , could get away with this even for a minute ? None . The Cuban Americans in South Florida have made fools of themselves once again , and of all the rest of us . <p> BERNIE HARGADON <p> Orinda <p> . <p> RIGHT ON THE ISSUES <p> Editor  --  I 'm so proud of George W. Bush 's efforts to reach out to Latinos and stress education reform . Although Democrats have traditionally manipulated these issues , conservative policies are better on both , as recent polls suggest . A recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll , for example , shows that voters are rewarding Bush with a 9 percent lead . <p> On education , conservatives want to inject competition into the public school system , which will certainly benefit the consumer ( students and parents ) and will probably benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conservatives want to reform education , cut taxes for families and small businesses , and set moral examples for the country . These are all Latino priorities . Although Latinos have disagreed with Republicans on affirmative action in California , Gov . Bush has resolved similar controversies in Texas in a nondivisive way that attracted the support of Latinos . <p> Gov . Bush 's efforts worked in Texas and will work for the country . <p> HERMAN KONG <p> Brentwood <p> . <p> BUSH THE CAVEMAN <p> Editor  --  Oh , I feel so honored ! George W. has finally met with some gay people  --  and he says he 's better for it ! I can barely contain my excitement . So he condescends to meet , not with the actual leadership of the Log Cabin Republicans , but with a few selected so as not to offend his right-wing , ultra-conservative voter base . Well , now we can rest assured that we will be fairly represented if we vote for him . <p> Ugh ! Please ! He has no intention of changing his caveman political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-gay legislation that he and his cronies can dream up . So how , I wonder , has he become better ? Is he better because he managed to do it without wearing rubber gloves ? Or that he managed not to offend his friends in the Christian Coalition ? <p> Did he actually think this would sway the gay population of this country into voting for him ? The mere fact that he had to check with his " handful of conservative leaders " before arranging the meeting is a good indication of what he 'll be doing if he 's elected . Oh , that 's right , he 's not at all influenced by the zillions of dollars in special-interest money he 's collecting hand over fist . Well , at least he gave us the real definition of " . . . a huge , you know , political nightmare for people . " <p> KELLY PURCELL <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> LIFESTYLE IRONY <p> Editor  --  I was troubled by your front-page article Friday morning ( " Gas Habit Hard to Break " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deter most Bay Area commuters from driving to and from work . Convenience , luxury and a " me first " attitude have become habits that have obfuscated the reality of our increasingly overcrowded and polluted landscape . Many of us have benefited from a robust economy and are enjoying the fruits of our labor and investments without realizing a great irony : Our lifestyles are actually contributing to a decreasing quality of life overall . <p> Each morning as I recline my seat and turn on my reading lamp , I have a comfortable , stress-free commute from Marin to the city on public transit . As the coach approaches the tunnel , traffic turns to gridlock . I look out my window , and much to my chagrin ( but not to my surprise ) , I see a very significant contributor to the traffic problem : one person occupying each vehicle . <p> While I certainly realize that public transportation and carpooling are not feasible for everyone , I can not help but wonder how many delays could be reduced during commute hours if even just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on a ferry on a summer Friday afternoon , glass of wine in hand , might just convert a few commuters ! <p> SUZANNE PORTEUS <p> Larkspur <p> . <p> SCHOOL SPENDING LAGS <p> Editor  --  It is shocking that California is the 40th state in the nation in per-pupil spending on public schools  --  $1,500 less per student than the national average . Unless we surpass that national average in funding , there is no hope we can surpass the national average in results . <p> Ambitious politicians can provide merit scholarships and teacher bonuses to a privileged few from now until doomsday , but such " reforms " will not improve the lot of the many students who are taught by untrained teachers in huge classes ( above the third grade ) in dilapidated buildings with obsolete and inadequate instructional materials . <p> Public education in a democratic society is supposed to be the great equalizer of opportunity between rich and poor . Students coming from an impoverished home to an impoverished school are given scant opportunity to soar intellectually . Our democracy depends on an educated citizenry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must invest in our future by funding public education adequately . <p> JOAN-MARIE SHELLEY <p> Democratic Women 's Forum <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> VERY SAN FRANCISCO <p> Editor  --  I note with interest Robert Powsner 's abhorrence of the palm tree in San Francisco ( Letters , April 8 ) . Herb Caen once raised the same issue , and I corresponded with him . <p> In Caen 's column of March 6 , 1992 , he stated , " Bunk ' Sicotte checks in with evidence that palm trees along the Embarcadero will be very much in the old S.F spirit . He has a copy of the classic song Down Among the Sheltering Palms , ' whose second line goes , Meet me down by the old Golden Gate , out where the sun goes down about eight , ' a picturesque line . The song was a smash hit at the 1915 Fair . " <p> As a third-generation native of the city , I remember palm trees along Dolores Street , and I even have a picture of my father 's graduation taken somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard . <p> I will support Mr. Powsner 's suggestion that we get rid of this nonnative species only if the filthy , drippy , ugly eucalyptus goes , too . <p> I. P. SICOTTE Jr . <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> TAM HIGH CLASS OF ' 70 <p> Editor  --  The Tamalpais High School class of 1970 is planning a reunion to be held in Mill Valley this July . We have lost touch with many of our classmates . Any contact information can be mailed to 98 Lovell Avenue , Mill Valley , CA 94941 ; e-mailed to tamhiclass70@hotmail.com ; or call ( 415 ) 479-9787 . <p> ANN ( THORPE ) PIERSON <p> San Rafael <p> . <p> JOE 'S HANGOUT <p> Editor  --  As a contemporary of the DiMaggio Brothers and native of San Francisco , I was a big fan and friend of Joe 's over the years . <p> I would like to point out that Joe 's home away from home was the Presidio Golf Club . DiMaggio , a very private person , used the club house as his hangout whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Joe were here , he would smile and wave away with a hand any suggestion that the Presidio Golf Club be named in his honor . <p> However , I do feel he would be delighted , along with Dom and Vince , to have old North Beach Playground bear his name . <p> I can see Joe 's nod and smile as he thanks me for writing this letter to the editor and again reminding me that baseball is only a game . <p> True , Joe ! But city parks taught thousands of teenagers how to play as a team , be competitive , follow orders of their coaches , and gave them an incentive to be a leader . <p> ( We miss you , Joe , at the 19th hole . ) <p> AL COUTTS <p> Corte Madera
