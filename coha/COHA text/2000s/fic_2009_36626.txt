The homeless man 's murder had been ritualistic , brutal , and efficient . <br> Megan Elliott swatted flies that swarmed near the body next to the Dumpster as she squatted beside the victim . It was midmorning and the temperature was already eighty degrees . The bullet had gone in clean , execution style , behind the ear . All signs suggested that he 'd been killed right here , in a narrow alley separating a parking garage from the historic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament . <br> There did n't appear to be signs of struggle , but here in the decrepit underside of Sacramento , that was difficult to determine . While the city did a fairly good job at keeping most of the streets clean , on the north side of downtown , away from the Capitol building and closer to the soup kitchen , the grime and unwanted bred . Here , homeless weeded through the garbage off K Street for something edible when the city rolled up the sidewalks ; or they slept against brick walls , clutching their meager possessions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and based on the lack of blood spatter , the victim had been prone when shot at close range . But he had the same outward injuries as the other two known victims . His hamstrings had been cut clean through , incapacitating him . His wrists had been duct-taped to something , as evidenced from the chafing and band of missing arm hair . And he was barefoot . <br> " What are you thinking ? " <br> Megan stood and , though she was five foot eight , she had to look up at Detective John Black , who had to be close to six and a half feet tall . <br> " All the appearances of an execution , but you 're absolutely right . The M.O . matches the murders on the recent FBI hot sheet . " And to maintain good relations with local law enforcement , she added , " You were right on the money there . Thanks . " <br> " His hamstrings were n't cut here . Not enough blood . No spray or cast-off . " <br> Megan glanced around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the alleyway . Where had he been attacked ? <br> Without touching the filthily clad victim , she inspected the deep gash in the back of his legs . She mim ? icked a slicing motion with her hand and then said , " I 'll need the coroner 's report , but it appears that the killer sliced right to left , cutting both legs with an even , fluid motion . " She stood and said , " Turn around . " <br> Black did , looking over his shoulder . She said , " You 're much taller than the victim . If the victim was walking , the killer would have had to have walked up behind him and  --  slice  --  cut the hamstrings . " She mim-icked the motion against the back of Black 's knees . " It 's the only thing that makes sense . If the vic was lying down , why would the killer slice his legs across ? " <br> " It would help if we could locate where he was attacked . " <br> Megan agreed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be obvious at the autopsy with bruising or evidence on his pants . But why shoot him here ? Why did the killer move him at all after the inital attack ? " <br> Wearing latex gloves and plastic booties over her shoes , an attractive , well-dressed woman who may have been thirty on her last birthday approached . " Nice theory , but maybe you should wait for crime scene analysis . " <br> Black 's lips twitched . " Simone , FBI Supervisory Agent Megan Elliott . Agent Elliott , Simone Charles , CSU Supervisor . " <br> Megan nodded . She 'd worked with the prickly perfectionist before . " We 've met . So , what does the evidence show , Simone ? " <br> " My team just came off a triple murder in the Pocket . Sorry for being late . " She did n't sound sorry , but Megan noticed the red eyes and tight expression . She 'd heard about the murder-suicide before she 'd left FBI headquarters . A man came home early in the morning , drunk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then blew his own brains out . <br> " You 're not late , " Megan said . <br> Simone motioned for one of her team to photograph the scene and the body . " I 'll walk the area and be right back . You have a wide perimeter , " she noted to Detective Black . " Any reason ? " <br> " To keep the vultures at bay . " He nodded toward the KCRA-3 van parked at the edge of the crime scene tape . <br> She grinned and walked away , dropping markers at specific spots . <br> Black said , " So was he killed here or not ? " <br> Megan clarified . " He was definitely shot right here , small-caliber handgun is my guess , twenty-two caliber , behind the left ear . A twenty-two is very effective at close range . " <br> Megan had seen far too many execution-style murder victims when she was part of the national Evidence Response Team that went to Kosovo ten years ago . Which led to the question of why disable the victim first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held true compared with the first two known victims , Megan already had the answer : between the time the victim 's hamstrings were cut to when he was shot , someone had received sick pleasure from torturing him . Handicapping the victim was to keep him from escaping . <br> " We need to find out where he was attacked and tortured , " Megan said . <br> The two previous victims had no visible marks until their clothing was removed . Then dozens of tiny pinpricks were obvious . " He plays before he kills . " <br> " Excuse me ? " <br> Megan had forgotten that she was n't alone . The members of Squad Eight  --  the Violent Crimes/Major Offender Squad that she headed  --  were used to her talking to herself ; she had to remember she was out of her element here , assisting SPD . <br> " Just thinking out loud . " <br> Megan itched to inspect the victim 's feet , but she did n't want to touch the body until the coroner 's unit arrived . <br> First Austin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , California . The only thing those three places had in common , on the surface , was that they were large cities . The victims were single , male , between the ages of thirty-five and forty-five , tortured and murdered in their homes . While most serial predators stayed within one race , the first victim was black and the second and third were white . The first vic owned his own business and , though divorced , was by all accounts a devoted father . The second vic had never married , had a rap sheet for minor drug charges , and worked as a mechanic . There was some indication that he had a gambling problem , which delayed the local police from reporting the crime to the national database , mistakenly believing it was payback for an uncollected debt . The hot sheet possibly linking the two had only been sent out late last week . <br> As if reading her mind , or simply breathing too deeply , Black got on the radio and said to someone , " This body is cooking and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coroner ? " <br> A gender-neutral voice replied , " On scene . " <br> " Great . " Black looked around , frowned , and said to Megan , " I 'll find him . " He stalked off . <br> It was n't standard procedure for an FBI agent to go out to crime scenes alone , even aiding the local P.D. , but there had been no initial certainty that this homicide was connected to the two other murders . Because her squad was already spread extremely thin , Megan had opted to check the scene herself . <br> But there was no doubt in her mind after viewing the body that the murder of this homeless man was connected somehow to the murders in Texas and Nevada . Why and how were the two big questions other than , of course , who . <br> She would wait to call it in until she had more information . <br> Megan frowned as she visually inspected the body again . Something else struck her as odd . Because the victim was homeless and had been living on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his age was indeterminate . At first glance , he could be as young as thirty , but the ravages of drugs and alcohol or simply the hard years living on the streets aged him . His clothes had n't been washed in weeks or longer , so his hands stood out . <br> They were clean . <br> She looked around for someone from the CSU or SPD , but all she saw were uniforms , and they eyed her apprehensively . Her boss , Bob Richardson , had made great inroads working with local law enforcement , but there were always a few who blamed the " Fibbies " for everything bad that happened on a call . <br> She took out her BlackBerry and snapped a couple photographs . Not SOP , but she did n't plan to use the photos as evidence . She wanted to remember to ask the CSU about the hands , and this was Megan 's reminder . <br> Were clean hands part of the killer 's ritual ? Or was this something new ? Or special for this victim ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Or maybe there had been evidence on his hands and the killer had cleaned them . Very little could destroy evidence if the lab and technicians were good enough . But bleach or another caustic cleanser could be a sign that the victim had fought back and the killer had tried to conceal the evidence . <br> She knelt down and sniffed close to the hands . <br> Continues ...
