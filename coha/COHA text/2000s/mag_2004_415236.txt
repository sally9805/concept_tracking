Attention to the small stuff often makes the difference between a bagged buck and a story about what went wrong . Here are 20 tips that I hunt by . 1 . Before a buck appears , use a range finder to check yardages of different points around your stand . You might even mark the ranges with color-coded tacks on trees . This way you 'll pick the right pin for sure , boosting your odds of a double-lung hit . 2 . Screw fixed or mechanical broadheads into the arrows you 'll tote in your quiver and test every one on a broadhead target . Two or three will undoubtedly fly more smoothly and accurately than the rest . Mark those shafts , hone or replace blades as necessary and shoot them first in the field . 3 . To quiet a bow and prevent bucks from jumping the string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties on string silencers , uses fork tamers or heat shrink on his arrow rest and pads areas around the rest with moleskin . " Arrows should weigh at least six grains for every pound of bow draw weight to keep them from making a cracking sound when they leave the string , " he says . 4 . Pack a journal . Record all deer sightings , along with the time of day , the wind direction and the weather . Cross-reference this data against an aerial photo of your bow area ; you 'll be amazed at how deer patterns jump out at you . 5 . " In many woods the first scrapes pop up on the edges of old logging roads , " says Jim Crumley , 6 . Virginia archer and creator of Trebark camouflage . " Slip along and scout those roads first . " 7 . If a mature doe walks downwind of your stand and smells a rat ( i.e. , you ) , she 's liable to stamp and blow for five minutes . To reduce the chance of such a scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over a spot where deer probably wo n't or ca n't walka pasture , rocky gully or deep creek . 8 . Hunting videographer Terry Drury , of Drury Outdoors , says you should hang your tree stands between 17 and 20 feet up . " At that height , when a deer is broadside between fifteen and twenty-five yards away , you 'll have a good shooting angle . " 9 . Look around for logs or brushy tops that would block a buck from walking within 30 yards of your stand . Drag big stuff away and stash it downwind . It amazes me how many hunters fail to do this . They end up sitting and watching deer after deer skirt a log or treetop and veer 10 to 20 yards out of bow range . 10 . News flash : It 's foolish to sit in a tree stand you ca n't shoot out of . Trim at least three shooting lanes . Hunters are too hesitant to do this . 11 . For the best visibility and the most shooting light at dawn and dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east . With the rising or setting sun at your back , you 'll be shaded and hidden . A buck 's antlers and hide will shine , making him easy to pick up a long way out . 12 . If you scout near a stream , do n't let the sandy soil fool you . Tracks and scrapes in sand are generally fresher than they look . 13 . If heavy rains swell a creek into a food plot or oak bottom , deer will hop over to the next closest feed until the water recedes . Move to crops or clover 100 yards away , or hang a stand on a high-and-dry oak ridge and try to surprise a buck at dinnertime . 14 . Boots with hard soles and deep lugs grate , thud and bang on a steel platform . A buck that hears you as you stand to draw will look up , get bug-eyed and bolt . Boots with soft , quiet soles and shallow lugs are best when hunting from a tree stand . 15 . If the wind is calm , pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in the morning and sink in late afternoon . You might not like hunting in a steady 15 to 20 mph breeze , but the upside to a stiff wind is that it shoots your scent in a narrow stream behind your stand . Vertical currents are the most unpredictable and the toughest to handle . 16 . Though they have n't been hunted in a year , many whitetails are super sensitive in early October . If you 're sloppy as you enter or leave a stand , you might clear a field or woodlot of deer and contaminate the spot for a week . Sneak in from downwind , hide behind structure , do n't crack a stick , do n't squeak a wire fence and do n't bang a boot on an aluminum ladder ... get the idea ? 17 . Though I 've yet to see a buck with a barometer hanging in his core area , deer sure tend to move well when the barometric pressure is rising or falling . Try to hunt those high-pressure days after a cold front blows through your neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bow range . You never know when one will come toward you to check out the commotion . Pack a bleat call too . " Often deer can hear sassy , high-pitched bleats farther than grunts , especially if it 's windy , " says Will Primos of Primos Hunting Calls . 19 . Leave your rattling antlers at home before October 25 . That way , you wo n't get the urge to rattle and spook deer that are n't yet ready to respond . Start cracking and grinding antlers together around Halloween and keep it up for the next three weeks . 20 . Big rubs generally tell you a big buck is working a ridge or draw . Look for snapped-off limbs and mangled saplings : They mean the buck is aggressive . That 's the kind of buck you want to hunt , because he 's apt to move quite a bit during daylight hours . Remember to draw and be ready to fire before you grunt with your voice . This might seem obvious , but it 's easy to get pumped up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 20 yards below you and trotting away from your stand . If you stop him first and then try to draw , only a miracle will keep you from getting busted . If that happens , you might as well go home , and take your stand with you .
