( we incorrectly wrote that red light bends more than blue light as it passes through a water droplet . The reverse is true . Why are rainbows shaped like an arch ? J.P . Physher Chandler , Ariz . Imagine looking at a rainbow off to the east . The sun is setting behind you in the west . White sunlight ( a combination of all the colors in the rainbow ) travels through the atmosphere , flies eastward past your head , and hits the water droplets as they fall from a passing storm . When a beam of light hits one of these droplets , one of two things can happen : The light could simply pass through , or , more interestingly , it could hit the front of the droplet , bend as it enters , then reflect off the back of the droplet and leave through the front , back toward us . This is the light that forms rainbows . The amount light bends as it passes through the droplet depends on the light 's wavelength , or color  --  red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on , down to violet , which bends the least . Since each color is bent through a specific angle  --  red light comes from the sun and is reflected back at an angle 42 degrees away from its original direction , while blue light bends only 40 degrees  --  each color appears at a different place in the sky . Red , say , denotes all those locations in the sky 42 degrees away from an imaginary line connecting the sun to the back of your head . Together , these places trace out an arch . Since blue appears only 40 degrees from this imaginary line ( which also connects your head to its shadow ) , the blue arch of a rainbow is always below the red . What is the difference between all-wheel drive and four-wheel drive ? Victor Dejesus Brooklyn , N.Y . All-wheel drive ( AWD ) is a full-time system , intended for use on pavement . It provides surefooted traction even when roads are slippery from rain , ice or leaves . Traditionally , power was divided among the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computerized traction control systems . These systems feed traction data from sensors in the wheels to a central computer . If the computer senses one or more wheels are about to slip , it redirects power to the other wheels using a system of individual clutches . Engineers created the original AWD systems by connecting the rear wheels to a front-wheel-drive powertrain . Four-wheel drive ( 4WD ) , by contrast , is a part-time system used mostly on heavy-duty trucks , and is designed for use off-road or in deep snow . When extra traction is needed , four-wheel-drive vehicles employ a " low " setting , which reduces the transmission 's gear ratio . Engineers usually create these systems by adding power to the front wheels of a rear-wheel-drive vehicle . To add to the confusion , some full-time 4WD systems bridge the gap between AWD and 4WD . Systems such as Jeep 's Quadra-Trac continuously power all four wheels the way AWD systems do , but they feature a transfer case with a 4WD-low setting . Cars ( and car-derived SUVs ) are typically AWD . Trucks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is increasingly available on trucks . The number of annoying pop-up windows on Web sites only seems to be increasing . What 's the best defense ? Matt Stagg New York , N.Y . Buy an Internet pop-up window killer . This is a software program designed to monitor the html and JavaScript codes that are transferred to your computer , and intercept the " window open " command that launches pop-up ads for travel services , online casinos and other come-ons ( we confess there 's one at www.popsci.com ) . When the program finds one , the command is purged before the pesky pop-up can be displayed . But not all pop-up windows are bad : Some crucial applications like online banking use them as well . To make sure pop-up windows work in those cases , good software will allow pop-ups to appear when they occur as part of a secure connection , which online banking , shopping , e-mail and the like usually provide . AdSubtract ( www.adsubtract.com ) is a fairly advanced software program that protects your computer not just from pop-ups but from virtually all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet computers where most ads originate  --  and blocks anything that originates there . If you choose , it will also block cookies ( small files a Web server stores on your hard disk which can be used to compile information on you ) , JavaScript and other Web features . You can even set it up so that you hear a gun , explosion or other alarming sound every time your computer " shoots down " a cookie , ad or pop-up window . Another program , Stopzilla ( www.stopzilla.com ) , filters only pop-up windows , but as it does so it displays a convenient little box that tells you exactly what it 's blocking , giving you the opportunity to override it . Unfortunately , these programs and most others like them run only on PCs . We found one shareware program for Macs called Pop-up Zapper ( batista.org/zap ) . In our trial , it kept all pop-ups at bay but occasionally filtered out stuff we needed . WIN A T-SHIRT !
