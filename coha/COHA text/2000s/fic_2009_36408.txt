They had finished dinner a half hour ago , and now they sat on the porch waiting for the rains to come . The nighttime air was heavy with moisture , but it held its burden in check , like a widow blinking back her tears . While they waited , the storm entertained them with its flash and dazzle  --  the drumbeat of the thunder , the silver slashes of lightning against the black skin of the sky . With each explosion of lightning they saw the scene before them  --  the tall shadows on their front lawn cast by the coconut trees , the still sand beyond the lawn , and even beyond that , the restless , furious sea , straining against the shore . <p> He had always loved thunderstorms , even as a young boy in Grand Rapids . While his older brother , Scott , cowered and flinched and pulled the bedcovers over his ears , Frank would stand before the window of their shared bedroom , feeling brave and powerful . Talking back to the storm . He would deliberately turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his older brother , usually as placid as the waters of Lake Michigan in the summer , turn into this fearful , unrecognizable creature . If they were lucky , their mother would come into their room to rock and calm her oldest boy down , and then Frank was free to escape to the second-floor porch that was adjacent to the guest bedroom . Being on this porch was the next best thing to being outdoors . From here , he felt closer to the tumultuous Michigan sky and violently , perilously free . Thunderstorms made him feel lonely , but it was a powerful lonely , something that connected him to the solitude of the world around him . If he stood on his toes and leaned his upper body out on the porch railing just so , the rain would hit his upturned face , the tiny pinpricks painful but exhilarating . The wind roared and Frank roared back ; his hands tingled with each burst of lightning , as if it was nothing but a projection of the jagged , electric energy that coursed through his pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become one of Frank 's greatest disappointments that his son had not inherited his love of thunderstorms . When little Benny would crawl into bed with them , when he would whimper and bottle up his ears with his index fingers , Frank fought conflicting urges  --  the protective , fatherly part of him would pray for the thunderstorm to pass , would want to cradle his son 's trembling body in the nest of his own , even as a small disappointment gathered like a lump in the back of his throat . <p> Unlike in Michigan , thunderstorms in western India did not pass quickly . They had been in Girbaug for seventeen months now and knew how it could rain nonstop for days during the monsoon season . Now , although it was only May , the forecast called for rain tonight . Frank felt grateful to be home to watch it . He sat impatiently , waiting for the heavy , laden sky to deliver its promise . The wind whipped around them , high enough that they did n't have to rock the swing they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Ellie had turned off the lights after they 'd picked up their after-dinner coffees and padded out to the porch . Every few minutes the lightning lit up the whole panoramic scene before them , like a camera flash . Frank knew that when the rains came crashing down they would come swiftly , brutally , and his body ached with anticipation . So far it had all been foreplay  --  the whispers of the tall coconut trees as they leaned into each other ; the cloying sweetness of the jasmine bushes ; the painful groaning of the thunder . Now , he longed for the satisfying release that the rains would deliver . <p> He turned toward Ellie and waited for the next flash of lightning to illuminate her face . They had exchanged a few aimless words since moving to the porch , but for the most part they had sat in an easy silence for which Frank was grateful . It was a contrast to most of their interactions these days , which were laced with bitterness and unspoken accusations . He knew he was losing Ellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand that lay just beyond the front yard , but he seemed unable to prevent the slow erosion . What she wanted from him  --  forgiveness  --  he could not grant her . What he wanted from her  --  his son back  --  she could n't give . <p> The lightning flashed , and he saw her white , slender body for an instant before the darkness carried her away again . She was sitting erect and still , her back pressed against the wooden boards of the swing . But what made Frank 's heart lurch was the look on her face . She sat with her eyes closed , a beatific expression on her face , looking for all the world like one of the Buddha statues they had seen on a recent trip to the Ajanta caves . She seemed to feel none of the agitation , the exciting turmoil , that was coursing through his body . Ellie seemed far away , as distant as the moon he could not see . Slipping away from his hands . Completely unaware of the memories tumbling through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann Arbor at night during a thunderstorm , laughing wildly and singing at the top of their lungs before arriving at the house she was renting , stripping off their wet clothes at the door and falling naked onto the couch she had inherited from the previous grad student who lived there ; him coming home from work one evening and finding Ellie lying on her stomach on the floor , trying to pull their four-year-old son from under their bed where he was hiding during a rainstorm . <p> A savage malice gripped Frank . As was common these days , something about Ellie 's calm irritated him . Deliberately , he said , " Do you remember how he used to  --  " <p> " Yes . Of course I remember . " She was wide awake now , having heard something in his voice that perhaps even he was not aware of . The satisfaction that Frank felt from having destroyed Ellie 's calm was tempered by something approaching regret . Her serenity , which he used to value so much , was now a scab he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
