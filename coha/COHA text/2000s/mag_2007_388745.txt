Headnote And maybe it was n't a bad idea // The giant thing swam closer to the sergeant damselfish 's nest on the coral reef , but the paterfamilias guarding the eggs did n't back down one bit . He darted and nipped threateningly at the huge , intruding shape , that is , to the extent that a 13-centimeter fish can threaten something that 's more than 10 times its length . " He bit my finger , " remembers the looming menace , aka Andrea Manica ot the University of Cambridge in England . " It was not even a particularly painful pinch . He did n't have any chance of hurting me in any way except for becoming rather a nuisance . It 's quite difficult when trying to take accurate measurements when the tape measure gets continually grabbed and pulled . " Swimming in the Seychelles , an archipelago in the Indian Ocean , Manica was just measuring fish nests . But the fierce little defender could n't have known that . Even though the fish was far overmatched , he stayed by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a hero in human terms . Yet , Manica saw this model father eat some of the eggs that he defended so fiercely . Among fish , childcare is typically a male 's job . In many species , a male claims a nesting site , and a female shops around the male territories . She eventually deposits a layer of eggs in a lucky guy 's nest , and the male then releases sperm over them . " This is where things get interesting , " says Manica . " Basically , the female just goes away , and Daddy is left with all these eggs to look after . " Scientists have long observed fish and other animals eating their young . But researchers tended to dismiss the practice as confusion or a weird behavior caused by captivity . Since the 1970s , however , researchers have been rethinking the practice , looking for a positive side to cannibalizing the kids . Eating all the kids in one meal , sometimes in one gulp , may be a salvage operation to boost the odds for future generations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nibbling a small proportion of the eggs at a time . Perhaps a single parent reaches a point where it 's impossible to go on without a snack . Or perhaps the little ones will breathe more easily overall if a few of them just disappear . These options raise an additional question : Which kids to eat ? BIG GULP Creatures as different as newts and storks occasionally eat their own young , but fish are the most studied of the filial cannibals , as the animals that eat their own offspring are called . Species with cannibalistic parents show up in at least 17 different fish families . Because fertilization is external , both fish parents can immediately swim away from their offspring , and plenty of moms and dads do just that . The typical cannibals are n't the swim-away parents but those that offer some care , at least for the early days . Parenting for most fish means tending the eggs . Once they hatch , currents sweep away the minute larvae , " and good luck to themit 's a harsh world out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 or 3 will reach adulthood . Eating the kids in one gulp is " conceptually different " from consuming just a portion of them in a series of snacks , says Manica . Oddly enough , total filial cannibalism is the easier observation for biologists to explain . Gulping the whole brood is all about the future . Among nesting fish , " the amazing thing that tends to happen is that you can end up with a male looking after something like 70- , 80- , 100-thousand eggs , " says Manica . " He could easily be looking after two times his body mass in eggs . " To achieve such a brood , a male typically advertises during the first several days of babysitting , for females to keep adding eggs to his stash . Scientists propose that a male ends up with more offspring over the course of his lifetime if he does n't run himself ragged for a small brood . He 's better oft starting over and trying to get more eggs . But when he abandons a small brood , some creature will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit . " Males sometimes just give up , eat all the eggs , and swim away , " says Manica . Egg eating also occurs among egg-guarding fish that do n't create nests . Instead , a parent gathers the fertilized eggs into its mouth . The adult then swims around for days with a mouthful of eggs until the young fish hatch and ride oft'on the currents . Mouth brooders tend to be female . However , the rare male mouth brooder often swallows the eggs if a female that 's more attractive-that is , bigger-than the original brood 's mother shows up with eggs to offer . Manica says that this happens when the father fish has invested only a day or two in the first brood s care . Total filial cannibalism occurs less often among mouth-brooding mothers . It wastes a lot of energy , Manica says . The mother puts more into making the eggs than the father does , and she wo n't recover all of it should she eat them . SNACK ATTACK In contrast to gulping down all the eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brood . The first paper suggesting a bright side to cannibalizing the young , by Sievert Rohwer in 1978 , proposed that the youngsters serve as an alternative food source for overworked caregivers . Manica says , " Put yourself in the shoes of this poor father . " A luscious pile of eggs attracts great interest in the crowded , competitive world of a coral reef . Manica has clocked a male fish fending off an intruder every minute and a half during a day of egg guarding . " Within half an hour , you were absolutely certain that the whole place had been cleaned spotless of any sign that eggs had ever been there , " he says . The father fish ca n't take even a coffee break until the eggs hatch . " He 's running a marathon for 10 days , and he 's got no food , " says Manica . " Now , all of a sudden , those babies are starting to look attractive . " " You can see the male as a cold-hearted individual eating his own offspring , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can see it as : Basically some offspring get sacrificed because that 's the only way to look after the rest . " Biologists have tested whether feeding a father fish cuts down on egg snacking , but results varied . In 2000 , Manica staged a large field test with sergeant damselfish ( Abudefduf sexfasciatus ) on a patch of reef in Malaysia . Three times a day , he swam around with a meat baster to feed half the male fish in his study population . He offered them either sergeant damselfish eggs that he 'd picked from another nest or a paste of crabmeat and bread . The males that had meals delivered cannibalized only about one-half to two-thirds as many of their eggs as the unfed neighbors did , Manica reported . Hunger and nutrition play a role in cannibalism , he concludes . Dinner by delivery did n't eliminate the cannibalism , however . Manica proposes that even well-fed fathers weed their eggs , eating ones with infections or developmental glitches . The lowered rate of cannibalism among fed fathers was similar , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he covered nests with a fine mesh so that no creature , not even Dad , could get to them . Manica has also tested for nutritional influence in an insect cannibal , the assassin bug Rhinocoris tristis . Lurking in shrubbery in Africa , fathers protect their eggs . Like fish , male assassin bugs keep soliciting eggs during the early days of guarding a clutch . When Manica and Lisa Thomas , also of Cambridge , checked on male assassin bugs as they stood guard over their broods , the researchers never found one out foraging for food . Yet the fathers did n't lose weight during their vigils . In the debris left over from hatching , Manica and Thomas found egg cases that had been mysteriously emptied of their contents . These did n't have popped-open lids , which would have signaled that the young bugs had climbed out . Nor did the cases show the signature holes of attacks by a parasitic wasp . The empty egg cases revealed the work of a subtler predator with narrow , stabbing mouthparts-like the fathers ' ' , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his offspring during his vigil , says Manica . " It if did n't have six legs and four wings , it would be a perfect fish , he notes . " BREATHING ROOM In 2002 , a research group at Queen Mary , University of London proposed another explanation of filial cannibalism . Maybe Dad 's doing it to avoid a shortage of oxygen for overcrowded eggs . Adam G. Payne , now a fisheries consultant in London , and his colleagues have looked at beaugregory damselfish ( Stegastes leucostictus ) guarding clutches of eggs in Discovery Bay , Jamaica . The fish eagerly ate freeze-dried nutrient tablets provided by the researchers . Males that each received a tablet daily grew faster than did males left to their own devices . As for cannibalism , though , feeding " had absolutely no effect , " says Payne . Thinking through the wreckage ofthat hypothesis , he noticed that the males picked eggs to eat that were scattered throughout their broods instead of just chewing big patches here and there . He also discovered that the eggs around the edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for some benefit of lowered egg density . Diminished oxygen availability in lab experiments did increase the parental egg eating . Payne and his colleagues also found that densely packed eggs developed more slowly than eggs that had been picked over . The idea that the dads are providing the eggs with breathing room intrigued Hope Klug of the University of Florida in Gainesville . " There seem to be a lot of systems where either personal condition or food availability does n't affect the amount of cannibalism , " she says . To test the importance of crowding , Klug looked to the sand gobies ( Pomatoschistm minutus ) common in the Baltic Sea . Males pile sand around shells or rock crevices to make nesting enclosures with openings only a centimeter or two across . If a female favors a particular male , she slips into his shelter and spends several hours upside down depositing a patch of eggs in a single layer on the ceiling . After the male fertilizes the eggs , the mother leaves them to his care . In the University of Helsinki 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two sizes into the fish tanks . The fish spread their eggs loosely on the large pottery pieces or crammed the eggs densely into the small-pot halves . Then , Klug moved egg batches , which were roughly equal in number , into a medium-size structure to standardize the conditions . Males with tightly packed eggs cannibalized more eggs than did the males with loosely packed eggs . In a separate experiment , Klug found that low egg densities improved the chances of embryo survival . Oddly enough , though , the oxygen concentrations had no effect on survival . Perhaps some other quirk of density , such as low concentrations of waste products building up around the eggs , improves embryo survival . Whatever the mechanism that boosts survival , Klug calculates that the males could eat 40 percent of their eggs , on average , without reducing the outcome of their reproductive efforts . In the absence of those eggs , the remaining eggs survive at a rate high enough to compensate for the drop from the original number , Klug and her colleagues reported in the October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal in their chances of getting eaten by a parent . Theorists have predicted that a hungry parent guarding a brood would choose the younger eggs because they hatch later and delay re-nesting . Tests of this prediction during the 1980s and 1990s by Paul Sikkel of Murray ( Ky . ) State University found a twist . During the first days of their parenting ordeal , male garibaldi fish ( Hypsypops rubicundus ) eat more of the older eggs . At that time , the males are still flirting with females and accepting contributions to the egg pile . Tests showed that females looked more favorably on a male with young eggs in the pile . Once the flirting period was over , however , the males tended to snack on the younger eggs . Besides egg age , certainty of paternity can influence a father 's choice of edible offspring . Earlier tests had suggested that when another male tries to fertilize the eggs during spawning , the broodguarding male is more likely to turn cannibal . New work shows that an intruding male has this effect even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The colorful males of Telmatherina sarasinorum compete fiercely to spawn with the drab females of Indonesia 's Lake Matano . Even after a couple has paired up , another male may dash over to it and release sperm that might reach at least some of the eggs . The original male then might understandably make the best of a bad job and get lunch . For three breeding seasons , Suzanne M. Gray of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby , British Columbia , watched several hundred encounters of courting T. sarasinorum . If a second male showed up , the chances tripled that the original male would turn around right after spawning and gobble some of the brood off the lake bottom . If a third male showed up , the chances of egg cannibalism rose almost sixfold , Gray and her colleagues report in the February American Naturalist . This is the first time that anyone has shown cannibalism increasing as evidence of cuckoldry increases , says Gray . In calculating the difference between the effects of one bounder and of two , scientists may be making a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that research demonstrates how dramatically ideas have changed since the days when eating the kids was considered just a crazy , stupid mistake .
