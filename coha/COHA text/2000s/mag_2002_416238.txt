Section : The Whole New Business Catalog INCQUERY How to go about getting your first products manufactured , financing a big sale , and marketing a service that no one wants to think about <p> NOTHING HAPPENS without a sale , as the saying goes , but first you need something to sell . This month we hear expert advice on conserving your capital while you manufacture your first products and research the market for them . We also get tips on dealing with a sale so big that you ca n't finance it and developing a positive image for a service with negative connotations . Getting Stuff Made <p> Inspired by the birth of my son eight months ago , I 've decided to go out on my own and start a company specializing in clothing and toys for babies . I 've done some research on manufacturing and concluded that I ca n't compete unless I manufacture overseas . <p> But that poses problems . For openers , the factories insist on a minimum order that is too large for me starting out . They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few thousand pieces . I do n't want to commit to purchasing that much inventory before I 've even tested the market . <p> Second , one of the baby toys I have in mind requires injection molding . It will cost me 5 to 10 times as much to make the molds in the United States as it would cost to make them overseas , but the overseas manufacturer will expect us to place a sizable order as soon as the molds are complete . Do you have any advice ? John <p> <p> " Those minimum-order requirements are actually good for you because they force you to look before you leap , " says Chuck Sussman , who worked with manufacturers both in the United States and abroad while building Pretty Neat Industries into the world 's leading maker of cosmetic organizers . Too many entrepreneurs fall in love with their idea for a new product and spend all their money on it , only to discover too late that no one else shares their enthusiasm . <p> " So the first step is to see if there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing some samples to potential buyers and soliciting orders from them . If you get a positive response , I 'd suggest you go initially with a domestic manufacturer . You 'll be able to buy smaller quantities than you would have to purchase if you were manufacturing abroad , and you wo n't have to wait as long for reorders . Granted , your production costs will be higher , so you 'll probably earn less profit , and you may have to charge more than you 'd like to . But you 'll , limit your risk while you 're figuring out how viable your idea is . Once you 're reasonably sure the market is big enough to handle the minimum-order requirements , you can move to manufacturing abroad . <p> " So how do you find those domestic manufacturers ? For the clothing , you 'll probably want an independent local contractor  --  or maybe two local contractors , since the cutting and sewing are often done in different shops . I 'd look in the yellow pages of a nearby major city . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment . <p> " With the molded items , I 'd have a sample maker produce an exact prototype of the final product . If prospective buyers like it enough to place orders , you can go ahead and mold your first production samples . I 'd start with an inexpensive aluminum or resin mold , which has a limited life expectancy but will get you going . Look for a small local molder who is hungry for business and will charge you hourly for setup time and then so much per piece . You 'll pay more per piece than you would if you ordered in bulk from a large molding company , but you can keep your production at a manageable level , and you 'll be able to oversee the making of the mold and the products . " Adventures in Cash Flow <p> About two years ago , I took over an almost bankrupt jewelry business and was able to turn it around using my own financial resources . ( We do the design and marketing ; the manufacturing is contracted out . ) The company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders of $1 million to $2 million . The problem is , I need outside capital to cover my costs until I get paid for the orders  --  about six to eight months  --  but the banks I deal with wo n't lend me the money if I do n't have a history of profits going back two to four years . So where can I find the financing I need ? Stuart <p> <p> " Before you look for financing , you might want to rethink the business you 're in , " says Sam Kaplan , president of Central Chase Associates , in New York City , who has helped raise money for dozens of young companies , including several of his own . " Right now you design , market , and sell jewelry that is manufactured by someone else . The question is , Do you also want to be in the business of financing receivables on behalf of yourself and the manufacturer ? <p> " You do n't have to be in that business if you 'd rather not be . I 'm sure you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a percentage of the total sales for your contributions . In effect , you 'd be functioning as a manufacturer 's rep with a design capability . Your ' commission ' would be somewhat smaller than the profit you 'd earn if you handled everything , but at least you could get the deal done without the expense , hassle , and risk of financing the receivables . <p> " Alternatively , you could go to your customers and see if they 'd be willing to finance the sale or at least give you better terms . Six to eight months is an awfully long time to wait to be paid . If your customers really want your jewelry , they may be willing to help you get it made  --  for example , by giving you a partial payment up front and the balance on delivery . <p> " If , on the other hand , you want to handle the financing yourself , your best bet is to go to an asset-based lender . It 's true that no ordinary bank will loan you the money you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time is six to eight months . Asset-based lenders look at other factors  --  your customers ' credit , for example . They also charge much higher interest rates than commercial banks and impose a lot of conditions on the loan , but you can probably find one that will do the deal if that 's the way you want to go . For more information and a long list of asset-based lenders , check out the Web site of the Commercial Finance Association ( www.cfa.com ) . " Long-Term Care for Fun and Profit <p> I am an insurance broker with two employees working out of a small office . It 's a good business , but it needs to change and start growing in a different direction . Our primary product right now is health insurance , which I believe will eventually be taken over by the government . Accordingly , I 'm planning to switch in the next year or so to longterm-care insurance as my primary product . <p> Selling long-term-care insurance will be a challenge . Most people do n't like to think about the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life they may have when they 're using it , but I 'm convinced that it 's our best bet for the future . So how can I motivate customers to buy such a product ? Dick <p> <p> " You 're not the first person to face this dilemma , " says marketing maven Max Carey , founder of Atlanta-based Corporate Resource Development Inc. and CEO of EmCrit , in Morristown , N.J. , a developer of communications platforms for fast-growth companies . " I ran into the same issue years ago , when I was working with a company that did retirement planning . The problem was that everyone thought about retirement as the end of life . So we came up with a campaign built around positioning retirement as the beginning of a new phase of life , and we did well . <p> " You need to do something similar with longterm-care insurance . For example , you might want to package it with other products and services that you could market together as , say , ' The Lifecycle of Peace of Mind . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaming up with a retirement community , a physical-therapy provider , a fitness center , or whatever . The idea would be to get potential customers thinking in terms of maximizing their quality of life as they grow older rather than focusing on what could go wrong . <p> " Long-term-care insurance would fit in with that , although I 'd definitely try to come up with another name for it . You want to accentuate the positive , as the song says , and that means looking at the upside  --  peace of mind , quality of life , and so on . The phrase long-term care has all the wrong connotations .

In fact , the socalled dean of American graphic design is no stranger to start-ups , having launched the influential Pushpin Studio in 1954 . But it 's Glaser 's reflections on sustaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to company founders . The article " Mind of a Master , " in the June issue of I.D . Magazine , is full of tantalizing insights about everything from the pivotal role of risk ( " Risk intrinsically is at the heart of the whole imaginative pursuit . It simply means you 're doing something that you do n't fully understand .... Certainty is the death of imagination " ) to the value of a curious mind ( " I 'm very promiscuous in terms of ideas ... I exclude nothing . The history of the world is at my disposal " ) . " Glaser 's lessons  --  do what you love , do n't let analysis stall momentum , embrace what you do n't understand  --  will speak to anyone starting a company , " says InfoPosse member Genevieve Foskett . " And if you like the article , treat yourself to Glaser 's most recent book , Art Is Work , which lays out his conceptual process in detail . " <p> LIES MY MOTHERBOARD TOLD ME : Seventy-eight percent of news stories published this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a made-up statistic , but whole-cloth fabrications seem appropriate now that everything from corporate-earnings statements to health-related claims are flunking the truth test . So the time is propitious for Web of Deception : Mis-information on the Internet ( Information Today , 2002 ) , a collection of essays edited by Anne Mintz . The book reads like a herpetologist 's tour through a pit of electronic vipers . There are warnings about bad legal advice ( consulting a lawyer on-line makes it difficult to sue for malpractice ) , bad company behavior ( businesses may use " dynamic pricing " to boost the cost of items based on buyers ' incomes or purchase histories ) , and bad medical information ( even reputable reference sites are slow to post information about drug recalls ) . In addition to tips for avoiding the snares , there 's a section on how to seek redress if you do get duped , including a rundown of relevant torts and advice on creating a revenge Web site that wo n't get you in trouble .

Unfortunately , inexperienced managers often lack the vocabulary to articulate employee strengths and weaknesses with the requisite precision . For more than two decades one book has been coming to their rescue : Effective Phrases for Performance Appraisals : A Guide to Successful Evaluations , by James E. Neal Jr . The ninth edition ( Neal Publications Inc. , 2000 ) contains more than 2,000 phrases covering achievements as quantifiable as cost management and productivity and as intangible as leadership and initiative . " Specificity is key to improving performance , " says Foskett . " You 'll get a better response by telling someone to work on ' effectively translating complex information into common terms ' than by suggesting they improve their communication skills .
