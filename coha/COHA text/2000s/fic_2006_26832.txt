A Boy in a Barrel On a blustery October night the Circus Oscuro came to town . It was clear from the start that this was no ordinary circus . It did not roll into town with fanfares and cartwheeling clowns . No one handed out flyers or announced the show through squawking loudspeakers . Instead , the circus came in the dead of night , when all the townspeople were asleep . Its wagons crept and rumbled down the winding road and across the old stone bridge while the town 's fat mayor , who normally had to give his permission before anyone could set up as much as a fruit stall , was snoring in his bed . The circus wagons turned in to the long field at the bottom of the hill that overlooked the town of Larde , and creaked to a halt in neat rows with barely a sound . From the wagons and trucks a strange crew emerged into the moonlight -- great muscled men with sun-darkened faces , a tattooed giantess with a booming voice who could lift three of the men at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckets of sawdust . They began to set up their enormous tent there and then by the light of flickering lanterns , with the wind whipping at the stripy canvas and cracking the ropes across the men 's hairy arms . Their shoutsand curses were snatched from their throats by the wind and flung up over the hill . Two elephants were led from one of the wagons and set to work , lifting wooden poles into place and pushing them upright with their stubbly foreheads . Acrobats ran up the swaying poles like monkeys , fixing ropes and leaping from point to point as though they were only inches from the ground , gripping lanterns in their strong teeth . A thin man on stilts 20 feet high checked blocks and pulleys and shouted orders to the men below . Slowly the huge tent rose from the grassy field like a great beast awakening , and still the townspeople slept , and the fat mayor 's snores ruffled his walrus mustache and rumbled through his wife 's dreams . There was just one witness to the arrival of the circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel high on the side of the hill , watched the raising of the big top , awakened from his sleep by the shouts of the circus people and the occasional trumpeting of the elephants . The boy 's name was Miles , and the barrel was his home . Now if you are picturing a shivering boy standing knee-deep in slimy rainwater in an upright barrel , you will need to turn that picture sideways and let the water run out for a start . This barrel lay on its side under a low-spreading pine tree , which provided shelter from the wind and the rain . It was an enormous barrel that had once held a fine vintage wine , and Miles could almost stand upright in it , although he was nearly eleven . It was dry and warm inside . In the barrel was an old mattress that had been thrown out by Piven , the baker , and which still gave out a cloud of fine flour when you sat on it . A candle stub in a fat bottle served as a lamp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larder . Miles had lived in his barrel on the side of the hill since escaping ( for the seventh time ) from Pinchbucket House , the county orphanage . He shared his wooden home with a small stuffed bear named Tangerine , no larger than a tall man 's hand . When Tangerine was n't out and about with his owner , he lived in a deep pocket of the old overcoat that Miles used as a blanket . Some of Tangerine 's stuffing had escaped , which made him a little floppy . His fur , which had once been the color of a tangerine , was now a kind of orangey gray . His mouth wore a crooked smile , and although he never said a word , he was a good listener . Under a silver moon Miles , curled up in the mouth of his barrel , watched as the circus tent grew fatter and taller and the thick ropes that anchored it grew tauter . The hypnotic ringing of sledgehammers on iron pegs and the snatches of strange music that floated from the trailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pulled the old overcoat tighter around him , and closed his eyes for a moment . When he opened them again he did not know how much time had passed , but everything seemed strangely still . Not an owl 's hoot or mouse 's rustle broke the silence , and the pine tree stood silently , undisturbed by the faintest breeze . Miles rubbed his eyes and looked out to see if work on the circus tent had ceased , but his eye was caught by something that had not been there before . A large shape crouched in the grass not twenty paces from where he sat in the mouth of his barrel . A shape with a huge head , enormous paws and a long striped tail . It was a fully grown Bengal tiger , stretched out motionless except for the tip of his tail , which twitched from side to side in the silvery grass . The tiger was so close Miles could almost count his whiskers . His inky stripes seemed to shift and breathe as the thin clouds swept across the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying out ; no one would hear him . He had never been face to face with a tiger before , but he was pretty sure that to the magnificent striped beast who sat a stone 's throw from his barrel , he must look like a sandwich whose bread had fallen off . The tiger yawned , his teeth like yellow knives in the red cave of his mouth , and gave a loud but oddly human sigh that made his whiskers shiver . His massive head turned and he stared directly at Miles with . . . Continues ...
