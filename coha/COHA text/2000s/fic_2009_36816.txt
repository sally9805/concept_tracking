She 'd forgotten to turn on the porch lights . <p> Kaycee Raye pulled into her driveway and slowed her red PT Cruiser . Her gaze bored into the night . The streetlamp across the road behind her dispelled too few shadows . Someone could be out there , watching . <p> Her gaze cut left to the neighbor 's decrepit black barn and its fence in need of paint . The barn hulked sullen and taunting , its bowed slats the perfect hiding place for peering eyes . <p> Kaycee shuddered . <p> She looked down Village Circle , running to the left of the barn into the apartment complex of Jessamine Village . All was quiet . Not unusual for nighttime in Wilmore , Kentucky , a small town about twenty minutes south of Lexington . <p> To the right of Kaycee 's house old Mrs. Foley 's wide front porch was lit . Kaycee stared into the dimness beyond the lamplight , searching for movement . <p> A curtain on Mrs. Foley 's side living room window edged back . Kaycee tensed . Backlit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched behind the glass . Watching . <p> Kaycee 's fingers curled around the steering wheel . It 's only Mrs. Foley , it 's only Mrs. Foley . The woman was harmless . Still , a vise clamped around Kaycee 's chest . Since childhood she 'd fought the strangling sense of being watched . Talk about Las Vegas odds - what were the chances of her buying a house next to a snoopy old woman ? <p> Kaycee struggled to grasp the coping skills she 'd learned over the years . Rational argument . Deep breathing for calm . Willing her muscles to relax . But her lungs only constricted more . <p> Swallowing hard , she eyed Mrs. Foley 's silhouette . Las Vegas odds ? Maybe . But fears could come true , even one 's worst fear . Had n't that happened to Kaycee 's best friend , Mandy Parksley ? Mandy had been plagued by the fear that , like her own mother , she would die young and leave her daughter , Hannah , behind . Kaycee insisted that would never come to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd suddenly developed a brain tumor - and died within nine months . <p> Mrs. Foley 's head moved slightly , as if she was trying to see inside Kaycee 's car . That did it . Time to flush the woman out . Kaycee flicked on the light inside her Cruiser , leaned sideways , and waved with animation . " Hey there , Mrs. Foley ! " She forced the words through clenched teeth . <p> The woman jerked away from the window , her curtain fluttering shut . <p> Breath returned to Kaycee slowly . <p> The bulb in her car seemed to brighten , exposing her to the night . Kaycee smacked off the light and glanced around . <p> Push back the fear . <p> But she could n't . At Mandy 's death a year ago , Kaycee 's lifelong coping skills had crumbled . Rational thinking no longer worked . If Mandy 's worst fear could happen , why could n't Kaycee 's ? Maybe there were people out there watching . <p> How ironic that Mandy had been drawn to her through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's There ? " had millions of readers across the country , all so grateful to Kaycee for helping them fight back . Crazy but courageous Kaycee Raye . If she could overcome her multiple fears , so could they . <p> In the end , she had n't been able to help Mandy . <p> If her readers only knew how far down she 'd spiraled since then . <p> Shoulders tight , Kaycee hit the remote button to open her garage and drove inside . As the door closed she slid from her car , gripping her purse . She hurried under the covered walkway to her back entrance , key in hand . Kaycee shoved open the door , her fingers scrabbling around the door frame for the overhead light switch . As the fluorescent light flickered on , she whisked inside , shut the door , and locked it . <p> Eyes closed , she exhaled . <p> The weight upon her lifted . In her own home she could relax . Unlike her mother , she did n't peer out windows every minute . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , all blinds and curtains had to be closed at night . She needed to complete that task . When she 'd left to visit Hannah , it had been daylight . <p> Kaycee 's heart squeezed . Every time Kaycee was with Hannah - which was often , after she 'd slid into place as surrogate mother - Mandy 's death hit her all over again . But this particular visit had been unusually heartrending . It had taken every ounce of fortitude Kaycee could muster to tell the begging , grief-stricken nine-year-old that she could n't leave her father and new stepmom and come live with her . <p> Kaycee placed her purse and key on the gray Formica counter at her left - the short bottom of a long-stemmed L of cabinets and sink - and inhaled the comforting smell of home . Tonight it mixed the regular scent of the old house 's wood with the chicken baked for supper . For once Kaycee had eaten a regular meal . <p> As the tension in her shoulders unwound , Kaycee breathed a prayer for Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that young age . But to see your father remarry within months , bringing a new mom with a daughter of her own into the house - Kaycee could strangle the man , even as she 'd assured Hannah , " you ca n't leave your dad ; he loves you . " <p> " Yeah , like he loved Mom , " Hannah sobbed . " She might as well have been a dog that died . Just go out and get another one . " <p> Kaycee sighed . Families were so hard . But so was not having one . Someday . At thirty , she still had time . <p> Kaycee stepped away from the counter - and heard a click . A flash lit the room . <p> Her head snapped up , her gaze cutting to the round table across the wide kitchen . A camera sat upon it . <p> Where had that come from ? <p> It had taken a picture . All by itself . <p> She stared at the camera , stunned . It was small and black . Looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only hers was silver . And bigger . And the last time she saw the thing it was in its case , sitting in the bottom drawer of her desk . <p> The camera 's lens stuck out . Aimed at her . It had taken a picture of her . <p> Kaycee looked around wildly , her paranoia like a thousand skittering insects across her back . Who had done this ? Somebody could be watching her by remote through that lens right now . <p> No . The thought was too petrifying . And far-fetched . Someone was just pulling a joke . <p> But who would do that ? And how would they get into her house ? She had n't given a key to anyone . <p> Kaycee edged toward the table sideways , palms up , as if the camera might explode in her face . Dark imaginings filled her head . Somewhere in a shadowy room sat a man , eyes glued to a monitor , chuckling at her terror as she approached . <p> Who was he ? What group was he a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop it . There 's a rational explanation ... <p> Her thigh grazed the table . The camera sat no higher than that part of her body . Did it have a wide enough lens to include her face when it took the picture ? <p> She extended a trembling arm and knocked the camera ninety degrees . There . Now they could n't see her . <p> Shallow-breathing , she leaned over to look down at the black rectangle . its " on " light glowed golden . <p> What other pictures had it taken ? Had they gone around her house , photographing every room ? <p> Nobody was here . It 's a joke , just a joke . <p> Kaycee reached out a tentative hand , drew it back . Reached out again . On the third try she picked up the camera . <p> She flipped it around and studied its controls on the back . Turned a dial to the " view " mode . A picture of herself filled the screen - with her head cropped off . Kaycee saw only her wiry body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for a wide lens . <p> Her finger hesitated over the back arrow button , then pressed . <p> Onto the screen jumped the close-up gruesome face of a dead man . Eyes half open , dark red holes in his jaw and forehead . Blood matted his hair . Printed in bold in the bottom left corner of the picture , across his neck : WE SEE YOU . <p> Kaycee dropped the camera and screamed . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
