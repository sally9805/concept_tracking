The photo on the front page of the Sunday paper was familiar . NO MOTHER 'S DAY FOR CORINNE 'S MOM read the headline above the plump , sad-eyed woman holding a photo of her pretty teenage daughter . Lucy Stone did n't have to read the story ; as a reporter for the weekly Pennysaver newspaper , she knew all about it . Corinne Appleton , who had a summer job working as a counselor for the town recreation program in nearby Shiloh , had disappeared minutes after her mother dropped her off at the park . The story had been front-page news for weeks , then had gradually slipped to page three and , finally , to the second section as other stories demanded attention . But now , ten months later , Corinne was still missing . <p> " How come you 're looking so glum ? " demanded her husband , Bill , as he entered the room . " Are n't you enjoying Mother 's Day ? " <p> Lucy quickly flipped over the paper , hiding Joanne Appleton 's reproachful face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented by the greeting card companies to boost sales , " she said , beginning the struggle to get into a pair of control-top panty hose . <p> " I always heard it was a creation of the necktie manufacturers , " complained Bill , who often declared he never regretted giving up suits and ties and Wall Street for the T-shirts and jeans he wore as a restoration carpenter in the little Maine town of Tinker 's Cove . " I finally found this in the coat closet downstairs , " he said , holding up a rather rumpled tie , the only one he possessed . <p> " If you think a tie is torture , you ought to try panty hose , " said Lucy , who usually wore jeans and running shoes , practical attire for her job . Today she was squeezing into heels and a suit for a Mother 's Day brunch at the fancy Queen Victoria Inn . " I do n't want to seem ungrateful , but I liked it better when the kids gave me homemade cards and plants for the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'd get to eat it in bed . " <p> " Eventually , " laughed Lucy . " I 'd be starving by the time it actually arrived . " <p> " That 's because they had to pick the pansies and make the place mat and decorate the napkin , " said Bill . " It was quite a production . And then they 'd fight over who got to carry the tray . " He looked across the bed at his wife , who was standing in front of her dresser , putting on a pair of earrings . " Those were the days , " he said , crossing the room and slipping his arms around her waist and nuzzling her neck . <p> His beard , now speckled with gray , tickled , and Lucy smiled . " Those days are over , " she said . " Our little nest is almost empty . " <p> It was true . Only Sara , a high school freshman , and Zoe , in fifth grade , remained at home . Toby , their oldest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eight-week-old Patrick , on neighboring Prudence Path . Elizabeth , their oldest daughter , was a student at Chamberlain College in Boston . <p> " Can you believe we 're grandparents ? " continued Lucy , tickling Bill 's ear . <p> " You 're still pretty hot , " said Bill , appreciatively eyeing her trim figure and cap of glossy dark hair . <p> " It 's a battle , " sighed Lucy , leaning forward to smooth on her age-defying makeup . <p> Bill grabbed her hips and pressed against her , but Lucy wiggled free . " We 'll be late , " she said , reaching for her lipstick . " Besides , now that I 'm actually in these panty hose , there 's no chance they 're coming off . " <p> Bill sighed and headed for the door . <p> " But I appreciate the gesture , " she added . <p> Out in the hallway Bill was knocking on the girls ' bedroom doors . " Bus leaves in five minutes , " he said . She heard him go downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressy shoes . <p> Lucy was the last to join the group in the kitchen . Bill was handsome in his all-purpose navy blazer , the girls adorable in flowery dresses that bared their arms and shoulders . They 'd freeze but there was no point telling them ; they 'd been planning what to wear for weeks , ever since Toby came up with the idea of treating his wife and mother to the Mother 's Day brunch . " It 's Molly 's first Mother 's Day , " he 'd said . " We should do something special . " <p> Unspoken , Lucy suspected , was his concern for Molly , who was making a slow recovery from a difficult pregnancy that ended abruptly on St. Patrick 's Day , several weeks earlier than expected . Little Patrick had n't appreciated his sudden entry into the world and was a cranky and fussy baby , demanding all his exhausted mother 's attention . Lucy helped as much as she could with household chores and meals , but only Molly could breast-feed the hungry little fellow , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Toby did his best to help , too , but he was putting in long hours on the boat , getting ready for lobster season . <p> The new parents were already seated when they arrived at the inn 's sunny dining room . Patrick was propped in a baby seat between them , sound asleep . <p> " What an angel , " cooed Lucy , stroking his downy cheek . Even in his sleep , his lips made little nursing motions . <p> " More like a barracuda , " complained Molly . She was still pudgy from her pregnancy , her face was splotchy , and she needed a haircut . Nevertheless , she 'd made an effort , and although she was still wearing maternity pants , she 'd topped them with a pretty pastel sweater . Seeing her , Lucy was reminded of the terrifying days after Toby 's birth , when she was afraid of dropping him on his head or sticking him with a diaper pin or starving him or overfeeding him and thereby proving her incompetence as a mother . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lucy . " But you 're obviously doing something right . He looks great . " <p> " He 's much too skinny , " said Molly . " Even though I nurse him constantly , I do n't think he 's getting enough . " <p> Lucy sat beside Molly and took her hand . " He just looks skinny to you , believe me , " she said . " Look at those little creases on his wrists . He 's positively chubby . " <p> " That 's what I 've been telling you , " chimed in Toby . <p> " He 's the cutest baby I 've ever seen , " declared Zoe . " When will he be old enough to play ? " <p> " Around six months , " said Sara , causing everyone at the table to look at her in surprise . " What ? " she responded defensively . " I took that baby-sitting course , remember ? " <p> " I remember . I 'm just surprised you do , " said a familiar voice . <p> Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black jeans , stilettos , and streaked hair . " I thought you were in Boston , " she exclaimed , jumping up to hug her daughter . <p> " I took the bus . I could n't miss brunch at the Queen Vic , " Elizabeth said , taking the last seat . " I used to work here , remember ? Today they 're waiting on me ! " <p> " Well , now that we 're all here , " announced Bill , " let 's hit the buffet . " <p> It was really a moment to savor , thought Lucy when she returned with a plateful of favorite foods : fruit salad with melon and berries , eggs Benedict , smoked salmon , and a croissant . And that was just to start . The buffet featured a raw bar with shrimp and oysters , stuffed chicken breast , ham , roast beef sliced to order , vegetable medleys , and salads , plus a lavish tiered display of desserts , set up in the middle of the elegant dining room . But while the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could eat . It was spending time with her family , especially Elizabeth , whom she did n't see that often , and the new baby , that was most precious to her . <p> Seeing them like this , with clean faces and dressed in their best clothes and minding their manners , was priceless . She could n't help but be proud of them . Toby , with his broad shoulders and easy smile ; Elizabeth in her sophisticated clothes and city haircut ; Sara , who had shed her baby fat and emerged as a graceful will-o ' - the- wisp ; and Zoe , with her sweet round face and big blue eyes . And they did n't just look good : they were good citizens . Toby was recognized by the other fishermen as a hard worker and a capable seaman , Elizabeth not only had top grades but had been chosen by her college to be a resident advisor , Sara was an honor student and cheerleader who also volunteered at the local animal shelter , and Zoe was the delight of her teachers and a keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the table at Bill , who was about to eat an enormous piece of sausage , and smiled at him . She was a good mother , but she could n't have done it without him . <p> " What are you smiling about ? " he asked , spearing a piece of bacon with his fork . <p> " I 'm just happy . It 's really special to be here with you all , " replied Lucy . <p> " I ca n't believe the baby is sleeping , " said Molly . " I was afraid he 'd scream his head off . This is special . " <p> Toby made eye contact with his father and , receiving a nod , pulled two pink envelopes out of his jacket . " Dad and I wanted to make it even more special , " he began , " so we got these for you . " <p> Lucy opened the thick envelope , which was lined with glossy pink paper , and withdrew a card printed with raised letters : PURE BLISS . Opening it , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body wrap , massage , manicure , and pedicure at the fabulous new spa everybody was talking about that had recently opened at the ritzy Salt Aire Resort and Spa . <p> " You should n't have , " she said . She was about to add that the gift was too expensive but bit her tongue just in time . This present , this Mother 's Day , was n't about her . It was for Molly , and she realized that her gift certificate came with a string attached : to make sure Molly got to the spa . " This will be fun , wo n't it , Molly ? A whole day of pampering . " <p> " I ca n't leave the baby for an entire day , " Molly said , shaking her head . <p> " Sure you can , " said Toby . " I 'll take care of him . " <p> Sara chimed in . " We 'll help , too , wo n't we , Zoe ? " <p> " I ca n't wait , " agreed Zoe . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .... " <p> " They can , if you pump in advance , " said Lucy . " And you wo n't be gone all day , especially if we tell them to put us on the fast track . " <p> " Well , " Molly said , sighing , " it does sound fabulous . " <p> " I ca n't wait . Let 's book our appoint- , " began Lucy , but she was interrupted in midsentence by a strident , complaining voice that cut through the hum of conversation and the tinkle of silverware to silence the entire room . <p> " This is unacceptable , simply unacceptable . When I made the reservation , I specifically requested the table in the corner with two windows . " <p> Lucy recognized Barbara Hume , who was standing in the doorway with her husband , Bart , and her sixteen-year-old daughter , Ashley . Today , as usual , the family projected an image of perfection . Bart , actually Dr. Barton Higginson Hume , was a noted cardiac surgeon . Tall and reedy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called Bar , " just like Mrs. Bush , the first Mrs. Bush , " never seemed to have a single shellacked hair out of place . Today she was as trim as ever , in a pale green suit and bone pumps with matching bag . Ashley was standing behind her parents , and even though she was perfectly turned out in a pink , pleated miniskirt and matching jacket , she was slouching awkwardly , with her toes turned in . <p> " I demand to see Jasper , " continued Bar , her voice growing even louder and more authoritative . Everyone in the room turned to watch as the inn 's longtime maetre d ' hurried over . <p> " Is there a problem ? " he asked . <p> " I 'll say there 's a problem . I was promised that the corner table , that one with the two windows , " said Bar , raising a perfectly manicured hand and pointing with her pink-tipped finger , " would be reserved for us . " <p> Lucy also recognized the family occupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of ignoring the fuss . At least Tina was . She was a large , sporty woman and was shoveling in forkfuls of food , intent on getting her money 's worth out of the buffet . Her husband , Lenny , a slight , serious man with a mop of curly gray hair , who wore oversize tortoiseshell eyeglasses , was staring at his plate and pushing his food around with his fork , looking distinctly uncomfortable . In contrast , their sixteen-year-old daughter , Heather , was staring contemptuously at Bar , just as you might expect from a talented figure skater who competed regularly and was n't afraid of a challenge . <p> " It 's a family tradition , " continued Bar in a voice that carried to the farthest corners of the room . " We come here every year for Mother 's Day , and we always sit at that table . " <p> Jasper cleared his voice and folded his hands . " I am so sorry . There must have been some confusion . We have some new staff members from Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Ukrainian . She spoke perfect English . " <p> " I regret the mistake , " continued Jasper , " but as you can see , the table is occupied . I will be happy to seat you someplace else . " <p> " I did not reserve a table someplace else , ' " snapped Bar . " I demand that you move those Nowaks from the table that should have been reserved for us and reseat them . " Bar glared at Tina . " Frankly , I would n't be surprised if somebody has n't done this on purpose , just to slight me . " <p> If she was hoping to get a response from Tina , she was disappointed . <p> Bart , however , cleared his throat , perhaps signaling his wife to cease and desist . If he thought such a subtle hint would calm Bar , he was mistaken . <p> She snapped her head around to face him , eyes ablaze . " Darling , " she began in a tone that was hardly loving , " perhaps you should slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the table we want . " <p> At the Nowaks ' table , Tina 's face reddened , but she continued to concentrate on her food . Her husband , Lenny , looked as if he was ready to abandon ship and vacate the table . He half rose from his chair but , receiving a sharp glance from Tina , sat back down . Heather was smirking , evidently finding the entire episode just another example of parental foolishness . <p> Jasper assumed a pained expression . " That will not be necessary , " he said . " Now , since it is impossible- " <p> " Nothing 's impossible , " declared Bar , eyes blazing . " Since you 've gone to the trouble of importing all these Ukrainians , temporary workers , I presume , who will be returning to their native villages at the end of the summer ? " <p> " Absolutely , " said Jasper , with a nod . " They all have temporary work visas . " <p> " You 'd better see they do . The country 's already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't need any more . Especially since most of them do n't even bother to learn English . " <p> " We screen our temporary workers very carefully , and I can assure you they all speak English . " <p> " Well , that 's something . Now , why do n't you put them to work and have them reseat those people " - she pointed at the Nowaks- " so we can have our table . " <p> Jasper 's professional veneer of patience was wearing thin . " We can not disturb the other diners , " he said . " I 'll be happy to seat you at another table . " <p> " Come along , Bar , " said Bart , taking his wife by the elbow . " How about that table over there ? It 's by a window , too . " <p> " But it 's not the corner , " replied Bar . " It 's not our table . " <p> Bart was firm . " It 's a window , and I 'm hungry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a sigh , dramatically rolling her eyes . " I do n't want to make a fuss . " <p> " Right , Mom , " muttered Ashley , sarcastically , as the group was ushered past the desired corner table . <p> Tina waited until Bar was behind her chair , and then she spoke to her husband . " Do n't you think it was rude of Bar to make such a fuss ? " she asked in a loud whisper . " Especially for someone who thinks she 's the next Emily Post . " <p> Bar pretended not to hear the comment but seemed to flinch slightly as she followed Jasper to the small window table adjacent to the Stones ' large round one . Jasper made an elaborate show of pulling out chairs for Bar and Ashley and even placed napkins on their laps with a graceful flourish and snapped his fingers to attract the water boy 's attention . He was filling their glasses when Bar took her revenge . <p> " You know , " she began , placing her hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low tone that nevertheless carried across the room , " sometimes when I 'm target shooting , I imagine Tina Nowak 's face on the target . " She giggled and smoothed her napkin . " It 's a surefire way to get a bull's-eye . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
