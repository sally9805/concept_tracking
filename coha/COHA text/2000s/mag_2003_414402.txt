The heart of skiing is huddled in a dark flat , cantilevered over the narrow , twisty streets of Le Chable , Switzerland . Here , eight guys from Colorado ( plus one Danish girl ) are sleeping foot to jowl , blissfully ignorant , for the moment , of each other 's endless snoring and flatulence . They could use the sleep . After topping a full day of off-piste traverses with a communal curry dinner and a sudsy poker session , the Coloradans are exhausted . They 'd crash till nine were it not for the Aggressively Meticulous Swiss Plow Driver , who barrels down the lane outside the window at dawn , battering blade against tarmac . The plow and Switzerland 's ubiquitous church bells make a deadly effective alarm clock . The flat starts to reverberate with groaning , yawning , chortling , Advil gulping , Meslix slurping , Fastex buckles clicking , coffee water boiling , chairs scraping , and transceivers beeping . At first , conversation is a Neanderthal series of grunts and snorts . Only when someone points outside and cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( plus one Danish girl ) truly wake up . Suddenly , there 's a whir of activity between the numbing , unheated bathroom and the cramped living room where boot liners dry atop every available radiator . The group  --  two snowboarders , three telemarkers , and four alpine skiers  --  miraculously gets geared up and out the door in a half hour . This must be a record of sorts . You 'd expect crack military units to mobilize quickly , but ski bums are about as straight and rigid as SpaghettiOs . Only powder can induce skiers to rally like Marines  --  and the slopes looming above Le Chable are wallowing in it . A dry blizzard dumped throughout the night , delivering a full meter . ( Or three feet for those of us who dislike the metric system , and , for that matter , soccer . ) A yard of snow ! The Coloradans rip run after run through nipple-high drifts , and too-good-to-be-true turns . Late in the afternoon , the group has split up , and I 'm skiing with one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the untracked . Now that conditions are ideal , we make an impromptu decision to ski to another village , Sembrancher , far below . Because we 're in the Alps , we can ride a train back to Le Chable . Only two other tracks have preceded us to town . We ski cream down alpine bowls and through widely spaced larch glades . Euro euphoria . As we 're walking to the train station through a cobblestone alley  --  a newly purchased three-dollar six-pack of good beer and some fine chocolate in our hands  --  the Coloradan says , " When the sky opened back there , it was like a sign from on high that we should ski down here . The whole day 's been a religious experience , and I do n't say that too often . I only get a sign from God every 10 years or so . " One can acquire beer , chocolate , and religious experiences in the Appalachians or Cascades , too , of course . But they 're just not the same on our side of the Atlantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what with the relatively cheap lift passes , the gargantuan vertical drops , and the deeply ingrained ski culture in which children slap on climbing skins to commute to school . In the evening following our religiously fluffy day , we reassemble in the flat for beers , wine , and pasta . There 's room for two people to eat in the kitchen . Everyone else grabs his plate and worms his way into the living room , holding his elbows in tight to avoid collisions with narrow door frames or a buddy 's skull . We 're more or less legal aliens here , but we 're living a life most illegal immigrants to the U.S. would recognize : crowding many more people than allowed into a small apartment , without the landlord 's knowledge , in order to taste the fruits of a foreign promised land . It 'd be tough to live this way forever . But even spoiled First Worlders from the roomy homes of American suburbia can adapt to Euro clusters for a few weeks . You do n't really need to bother with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International ski bums without much money can and do thrive in this coveted resort in one of the least affordable nations on the planet . One day at a weathered on-slope brasserie colloquially known as the Z.Z . Top Caf ( it 's officially named Caf Nendaz but plays " Tube Snake Boogie " a lot ) , I ask a Coloradan how he manages to linger here for four months ( which he does almost every winter ) . " Everybody cuts angles , " he answers , sipping a beverage that the cashier had believed was coffee . She charged him three Swiss Francs . " I try not to spend a lot of money . " He paid the three Swiss Francs , though he 'd actually filled his cup with two espressos . Retail price : six francs . By cutting such corners , a person could spend four months in the Alps for $4,000 , assuming they cooked almost all their meals at home and slept within earshot of their roommates 's bodily functions . During my days at the flat in Le Chable , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the multitudinous off-slope delights advertised in Verbier 's brochures . Our only splurges occur at the Mont Fort Pub  --  and even then only at happy hour when the bar offers two-for-one prices , which allows us to purchase a couple of giant steins of Cardinal beer ( enough to choke a 300-pound Milwaukeean ) for less than four bucks . Happy hour beer also makes one sociable and slightly unaware  --  good mental conditions for sharing cramped housing . Privacy and closet space , after all , hold negligible value when compared to skiing the vast snowfields and corkscrewing couloirs of the Alps . In yet another reflective moment , the Coloradan with whom I skied to Sembrancher admits , " It is foolish and hedonistic that we spend most of our life just pursuing powder turns . Sometimes it feels like we 're cheating at life . We 're winning and everyone else is losing . " Neutral observers might argue that cramming eight people into a cheap , down-valley flat with an icy-tiled , shrinkage-inducing john is n't exactly " winning at life . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiing powder . I am . " Still , what kind of person both lives in the mountains and takes vacations there ? Should n't ski-town dwellers haul their alabaster bodies to the beach instead ? " Some folks are desert people or beach people , " he shrugs . " We 're mountain people . " Another Coloradan chimes in with more keen skier logic : " I come here , and I do n't feel like a tourist , " he says , peering around the Gore-Texed butt of another Coloradan in order to make eye contact . " I feel like a tourist at the beach . I went to Mexico before I came here , and to tell you the truth , I was bored . I just sat on the sand and thought about skiing .
