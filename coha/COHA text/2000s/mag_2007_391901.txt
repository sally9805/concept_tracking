NEW MEXICO  --  It is a blindingly bright Southwest autumn morning in Frijoles Canyon , site of a good-sized Ancient Puebloan settlement whose spare but suggestive ruins make up the core of New Mexico 's Bandelier National Monument . I am alone , my labored breathing the only sound disturbing the cottony silence in this part of the canyon . Having just climbed 140 feet up three sets of ladders and worn rock steps into a large cleft in the canyon wall called Alcove House , I now descend a ladder to the dirt floor of a covered circular chamber called a kiva . In the dark cool of the room , I find myself in what is unmistakably a sacred place . Even though it is a recently rebuilt structure , unlike the roofless Big Kiva on the canyon floor only a half mile away , this room inspires the same sense of reverence you feel in or around other ceremonial chambers built by the Ancient Puebloan People ( sometimes called the Anasazi ) and their modern-day Pueblo descendants . Places are sacred according to how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , human societies have understood the sacred in ways that are both distinctive to their age and enduringly constant . Each understanding has in turn shaped the way humans have seen the world , or places within the world , often as reflections , representations , or embodiments of that order . I have come to northern New Mexico , a place rich in sacred sites , to look at examples of three quite distinctive approaches to the sacred , each representing a different age in the history of belief . Here in Frijoles Canyon is a place associated with the archaic approach to the sacred , an approach so all encompassing that it is closer to what anthropologists call a worldview than what we think of as a religion . This " original religious mode , " as philosopher Charles Taylor calls it , placed humans in a " world in which the order was already irrevocably fixed in an earlier time of foundation . " Individuals could in no significant way alter this order . Instead of changing the world or adding to what is thought of as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as re-enacting , in daily life and through ritual , the cycle of what the great scholar of religion Mircea Eliade called " the eternal return . " This was also a radically egalitarian age . With priests emerging only toward the end with the rise of states , people during most of the ancient period believed that they had equal access to a spirit-infused world  --  though shaman-healers were thought to have more intimate contact . Similarly , though the entire world was an enchanted place , some places served as ritual sites representing the larger spirit-charged world . The kiva was one such site for the Ancient Puebloan People . Despite variations in design , most of these sacred chambers have certain common features . Entered from a hole in the ceiling , they typically have a fire pit , a ventilation shaft , and a small indentation or hole in the floor called a sipapu . That hole is crucial because it symbolizes the spot from which the original human inhabitants of this world  --  the Fourth World , as it is called in many Pueblo creation stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal home , the much-sought-after Middle Place . The kiva was a special place where a people returned to their origins , a site for passing on ancient knowledge , a place for rites of passage that led to full membership in the community . Not too far from Bandelier , at the end of a long dirt road that follows the winding course of the Chama River , you come to a different kind of sacred place . It is a Christian monastery  --  Benedictine , to be precise  --  where today some 30 brothers and their abbot live their daily lives largely in accordance with the Rule set down by the sixth-century abbot and saint after whom the order is named . Benedict 's Rule was in fact a set of rules governing almost every aspect of the monks ' inner and outer lives . One part of it established the order and content of the seven canonical offices , or services , as well as a time for mass . Sublime structure . The place for worship  --  the sacred center of the monastery  --  is the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for prayer alone . The church at the Monastery of Christ in the Desert is a quietly sublime structure . Adobe for the most part , it has large expanses of glass that seem to bring the walls of the facing canyon right into the ceremonial heart of the church . Deserts were the sites of the earliest Christian monasteries , places of austerity and isolation where the seeker could , through assiduous devotion to work and prayer , draw closer to God . To monks steeped in the Gospels , these rigorous landscapes specifically recalled Jesus 's self-imposed 40-day trial in the wilderness . They were the sites of spiritual testing . Christianity is only one of the religions , and a late one at that , with seeds in what the German philosopher Karl Jaspers first dubbed the Axial Age . During this age  --  roughly 900 to 200 B.C.  --  four traditions arose in four different parts of the world , each representing a new approach to the sacred : Confucianism and Taoism in China ; Hinduism and Buddhism in India ; monotheism in Israel ; and philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own particular historical precursors , and most would have offspring ( including Christianity and Islam in the case of Judaism ) , each one acquired its distinctive and classical formulation during this age . But what was the common thread running through these traditions ? According to Taylor , it was the fact that all of them " took the diffuse and variegated order of earlier religion and tried to unify it under a transcendent supreme principle . " That principle , Taylor elaborates , could be a supreme creator God or some unified principles of order , like the Tao ; or the endless cycle of samsara , the Hindu and Sikh concept of reincarnation or rebirth ; or escape into the Buddha 's nirvana . While the implications of this change have been interpreted in many different ways , a few of its consequences seem beyond dispute . One is that the order of the world was no longer an immutable given , established once and for all in an unrecoverable past . Individuals , either by worshiping and obeying the Supreme Creator or through other beliefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that meant people could make history even while remaking themselves . The birth of history , the rise of the individual , and even , ironically , the rise of secularism were all made possible by the religious and ethical traditions born in the Axial Age . These traditions also led to the disenchantment of the world by concentrating the sacred in certain specific sites . Churches , shrines , temples , monasteries , and locations associated with saints or central figures in those traditions were places , often overseen or inhabited by priests or spiritual adepts , where the faithful could connect with the transcendent creator or principle . Like kivas , they were ceremonial places . But while kivas were symbolic representations of the spirit-infused world , sacred places in the Axial Age religions tended to be places apart from the world  --  a world not only emptied of its sacred dimension but also often viewed as a snare or illusion . Still , the ancient view of the world did not entirely die . In their various ways , the great religions accommodated it . Visit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you can see how Christianity made its own partial truce with the Puebloan worldview . Even the founding of the shrine has a mythic quality evocative of American Indian legend . Blessed soil . In 1810 , the story goes , a member of the Catholic Penitentes Brotherhood saw a light shining up from one of the hills . Digging into the ground , he found a crucifix , which he took to a church in nearby Santa Cruz . But the crucifix inexplicably returned to its place in the Chimayo hills , and did so after being carried to the Santa Cruz church two more times . Accepting this as a sign , the local Catholic hierarchy allowed a small church to be built in Chimayo , and the crucifix was mounted on its altar . Further blending the ancient American Indian religion and Catholicism , the church contains a small room with a little dirt-filled pit ( pocito , in Spanish ) in its center . The dirt is blessed by the clergy , and people seeking cures scoop up small portions to take with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no magical property . But the kivalike aspect of the pocito and the reverence with which the soil is regarded suggest a view of the world that predates Christianity . In more recent times , spiritual seekers of all kinds have intentionally sought to blend elements of the great Axial sacred traditions with the ancient approaches to the sacred . Whether searching for intense mystical experience or universal principles or insights into the human psyche , they have launched movements , founded communities , and written thousands of books . Sometimes dismissing it as New Age fadism , critics ignore the serious ambitions of such eclectic spirituality , including its attempts to recover the lost sense of an enchanted world . Among the many alternative communities founded in New Mexico over the years , none more enduringly embodies this open approach to the sacred than the Lama Foundation . Located some 25 miles north of Taos on the side of Mount Lama , the community occupies a compact cluster of central buildings  --  including a large dome used for classes and other gatherings  --  and a few small outlying residences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1967 , Lama has been home to a number of prominent spiritual luminaries , including the American Sufi teacher Samuel Lewis and Hindu convert and former Harvard psychologist Ram Dass ( born Richard Alpert ) , who wrote the bestselling Be Here Now . A serious commitment to spiritual pursuits is perhaps the greatest reason this community has endured . Its collective life adheres to a set of guidelines , from a rigorous spiritual curriculum ( prayers , dances , song , and meditation techniques drawn from various sacred traditions ) to work duties , including the running of large summer retreats that bring in much of the community 's income . Among local people who have helped the community  --  notably after it nearly burned down during a large forest fire in 1996  --  have been various members from the Taos Pueblo . They have taught practical building and gardening skills as well as local lore . Austin Babcock , who has been doing a lot of the recent construction of energy-efficient permaculture buildings , takes me up to the spring that provides the community 's water , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pueblo come to visit , " Babcock says , " they always ask , " How is the mountain ? How is the spring ? ' ' " Babcock and his wife , Kathy Lyons , tell me how the Pueblo sense of place has influenced the way they came to feel about the land . " The place , " she says , " becomes the meaning . " Is it merely the romantic conceit of a few postmodern religious seekers that they can recover an older religious sense of an enchanted world ? Perhaps . But their quest may resonate for others . After all , how people understand place  --  including its sacred dimension  --  influences what they seek in places , whether in natural settings or the human-built environment . The search for the Middle Place might be understood as something more than a lost ideal of the Ancient Puebloan People . Unless some sense of sacred purpose and presence inspires people 's relationship with place , the places they inhabit may end up being just as lifeless as they think they are .
