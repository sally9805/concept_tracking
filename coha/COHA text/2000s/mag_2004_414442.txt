Photograph In the Davis Bynum Winery garden , Nit Bynum ( left ) harvests produce to create dishes from her native Thailand . Friends reap the benefits from this marriage of sustainable garden and organic vineyards . // Under the canopy of oaks atop a hill overlooking California 's Russian River Valley , there 's more going on than dinner . Nit and Hampton Bynum are entertaining friends with a meal that merges the couple 's diverse backgrounds . Nit , a former reporter and business-school graduate from Thailand , with culinary training thrown in , prepares dishes based on classic Thai recipes . Hampton , vice president of Davis Bynum Winery , founded by his father , chooses the wines . The bold seasonings of Thai food can overwhelm wine , but not when they work together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flavors complement , rather than clash , with the wines . The meal starts with an appetizer of citrus-scented crab salad mounded on cucumber slices . Its accompanying wine-a crisp Fum Blanc with citrus and tropical fruit notes-has a similar fresh quality . A sweet-tart noodle and chicken salad pairs perfectly with the round , smooth Chardonnay , with its lean acid and Gravenstein apple flavor . Coconut milk tempers the spices of the green curry fish , so it works with the cherry , smoky plum , and other flavors in the Pinot Noir . This party also shows one of Hampton 's dreams for the region at work . Sonoma County has long been home to a variety of crops , including apples , beans , and hops . In recent years , though , wine grapes have become the major crop . The community has had to work to maintain the agricultural diversity it values so much . As a fifth-generation Californian , Hampton wanted his family winery to be " part of the solution , not the problem . " So in 1999 , he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest at Davis Bynum Winery . It 's a natural , agriculturally diverse ecosystem based on permaculture principles , which rely on the interactions of landscape features and plants ( see " Garden the Natural Way , " opposite ) . In the sustainable garden-now cared for by consultant Ryan Meyers , owner of Tierra Viva Landscape Design-more than 400 culinary , medicinal , and forage crops thrive , beneficial insects abound , and wildlife is welcome . The payoff is a gathering such as this , where organic vineyards provide grapes for the wines , and the permaculture garden and a small plot of Thai annuals produce the ingredients for a menu that puts an exciting new spin on East meeting West-one in which food , wine , lifestyle , and community harmonize with nature .

Photograph The Bynum permaculture forest nurtures family and provides diverse and fascinating foods and flowers . // Garden the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of a movement in garden design called permaculture . Founded by Australians Bill Mollison and David Holmgren , the idea is to create a more natural landscape that takes better care of itself than the average high-maintenance garden while yielding a plentiful harvest of plants for both food and materials . You can put these ideas to work in your own garden by shaping its bedding soil to capture water more efficiently and by carefully selecting and siting the plants .

While most effective on slopes ( as shown above ) , this technique also works well on flat land . 1 Plant deep-rooted trees ( fig , mulberry , peach , plum ) on tops of berms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Place thirsty plants ( angelica , comfrey , lemon grass ) on the wetter , upslope sides of the berms ( more water collects there than on the downslope sides ) or in the lowest area of the swales if your garden is flat . 3 Train annual vines , such as beans and cucumbers , up tree trunks . 4 Put dry-climate plants ( lavender , rosemary , sage ) on the drier , downslope sides of berms. 5 Plant hardy perennial groundcovers ( clover , mint , oregano , thyme ) in the low areas of the swales . 6 Set hardy perennials with average water needs ( artichoke , butterfly bush , rhubarb ) under the tree canopies . What to plant In general , use deep-rooted , low-maintenance perennials as well as annuals that reseed . Look for multitasking plants-for example , ones that provide food and also shade lower growers . * For food : Perennial fruits , fruit trees , herbs , and vegetables . * To create habitats : Bronze fennel , spearmint , and yarrow for beneficial insects ; butterfly bush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrubs , and trees for birds and other wildlife . * To improve soil structure : Deep-rooted plants , such as burdock and daikon radish , break up heavy soil and add organic matter . * For mulch : Burdock , comfrey , rhubarb , and other large-leaf plants . * To provide soil with nitrogen : Ceanothus , clover , legumes ( beans , peas ) , lupine , and sea buckthorn ( Hippophae rhamnoides ) . * To supply minerals ( as compost or mulch ) : Chives , comfrey , garlic , and white yarrow .
