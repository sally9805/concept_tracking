A profile of American teens <p> THE CURRENT COHORT of American teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17 is lonely , spiritually hungry and intensely aware of the threat of violence . That 's the profile that emerges from a recent Gallup Youth Survey . <p> Young people fear for their safety at school more than ever , despite dramatic increases in security measures . Nearly one in two ( 48 percent ) teens say they have had bomb threats in their own school since the 1999 Columbine school shootings in Colorado . Close to one in four ( 23 percent ) say they are fearful of going to school because of school violence . Black students are twice as likely as white students to report that they fear for their physical safety ( 26 percent versus 13 percent ) . <p> Also , teenagers today express feeling pressured and lonely . Among high school leaders , these feelings can be intense . A Gallup study of student leaders in the nationally recognized Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership seminar found them three times more likely than other teens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 percent of the general teenage population feels " pressured , " over half ( 55 percent ) of student leaders claim the same . <p> The spiritual hunger among teens is remarkable . Millions of teens attend church and youth groups regularly . Teenagers express a burgeoning interest in learning about other faith traditions , yet most remain faithful to their own orthodox beliefs . They are persuaded that faith is an important component in their lives , and many of them want to deepen their religious understanding . The challenge for churches is to help channel teenagers ' free-floating , often vague interest in spirituality into sincere religious conviction that grounds a life of faith . <p> The Gallup survey showed that 92 percent of teens consider their religious beliefs important to them . A third say faith is the most important influence in their lives . That number goes up to 52 percent for African-American teens . Close to four in ten say they pray alone frequently ( 42 percent ) and read the Bible at least weekly ( 36 percent ) . <p> Teens report a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church when compared to their parents or other adults . Ninety-five percent express belief in God , and 67 percent have confidence in organized religion . Over half ( 55 percent ) call themselves " religious , " with an additional 39 percent referring to themselves as " spiritual but not religious . " <p> American teenagers today more closely resemble their grandparents in church attendance . On average , the Gallup Youth Survey documents teen church attendance that is 10 percentage points higher than the national figures for all adults . In a recent study , 50 percent of American teens 13-17 report attending a local faith community within the past seven days . The statistic tumbles after high school with 35 percent of adults between the ages of 18 and 29 reporting attendance within the past week . It then climbs steadily with age : 40 percent for ages 3049 ; 45 percent , ages 50-64 ; and 56 percent among adults over 65 . <p> The strongest showing of youth church attendance occurs among American Protestants ; three in five of them report attending within the past week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their children should attend church together . Only 27 percent of the teen population expressed reluctance to have parents and teens in worship services together . <p> Even more teens report being part of a church youth group . Sixty-five percent of teenagers today say they have been involved in a youth group at some point , and of those , close to half ( 46 percent ) are still involved . When Gallup asks teens why they became involved , the answers reveal a surprising degree of depth . The top response ( 82 percent ) is that they want to learn more about faith . Seventy-three percent got involved because of parental encouragement . Over seven in ten ( 71 percent ) say they wanted a place to talk about what 's important to them , and nearly two in three ( 65 percent ) say they became involved because of a friend 's invitation . <p> Although the American religious scene is slowly becoming more pluralistic and diverse , the number of non-Christian teens in this country remains relatively small . In fact , American young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to prefer Mormonism , Judaism or Islam . While 9 percent of teens state that they have no religious preference , only a slim number assert that they are either atheist or agnostic . <p> Perhaps most pronounced about the religious lives of American teens is their spiritual curiosity . Over half of them want to learn more about Roman Catholicism ( 54 percent ) and Protestantism ( 52 percent ) . A higher proportion of Protestant teens want to learn about Roman Catholicism than Roman Catholic teens want to learn about Protestantism . Even more intriguing is the finding that the third most popular faith tradition American teens express a desire to learn about is Native American spirituality ( 44 percent ) . <p> RECOGNIZING THE CULTURE of violence in which they live , over half ( 53 percent ) of teens say " violence on TV and in movies sends the wrong message to young people . " One in three teens says he or she watched a " particularly violent TV program in the past month . " A similar proportion saw a strongly violent movie as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are less concerned about it than female teens . <p> While many schools have gone to great lengths to prevent another Columbine from happening in their own communities , most Americans do n't place the blame for school violence on school officials or on a lack of security . Adults ' main concern is the availability of guns . " Parents " were cited next as the source of the problem ( along with media , social pressures on youth and the Internet ) . <p> Parents of teens claim that , as a result of the episodes of school violence , they have taken action . Eighty percent say they have spoken to their children about not making fun of unpopular students or groups . Nearly half report supervising their own children 's activities more closely . Also , 38 percent say they have become more involved in their children 's school in the past year in an effort to protect their children . <p> Still , nearly two-thirds say that a Columbine-type shooting " is likely " to occur in their own community . And one-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their school capable of violence , based on what they do , say or claim they will do . Students believe these groups continue to bring weapons to schools , and 64 percent believe parents know about these groups . Fifty-eight percent of American teenagers say episodes of school violence reflect the overall mood of teens today . <p> Like many Americans , teenagers in recent years have sought to identify potential threats to their school communities . Four out of five teenagers ( 81 percent ) believe dangerous individuals can be identified by their dress , appearance or manner , as reflected in the " Trench Coat Mafia " at Columbine . <p> The situation , however , is far more complex . Toward the end of President Clinton 's administration , the Secret Service conducted a threat assessment based on a review of more than 30 school shooters . The purpose behind the study , titled the Safe School Initiative , was to harness the knowledge and expertise of the Secret Service on behalf of police and others trying to safeguard American schools . Several interesting findings emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed by boys or young men by attackers . In over half of the incidents , the attacker had selected at least one school administrator , faculty member or staff member as a target . <p> More than half of the attacks occurred in the middle of the school day . <p> Incidents of targeted violence at A school are rarely impulsive . As the report states , they are " typically the end result of an understandable and often discernible process of thinking and behavior . " <p> Prior to most incidents , the attacker told someone about his idea or plan . <p> There is no accurate or useful profile of " the school shooter . " They range in age from 11 to 21 , come from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds , exhibit a range of academic performance ( from excellent to failing ) , and vary substantially in personality and social characteristics . <p> The Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center found that most attackers had previously used guns and had access to them , and most shooting incidents were not resolved by law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having been bullied played a key role in the attack . <p> By D.
