Too Hot to Hoot The immortal storyteller Alfred Bester once said that the way to tell a story is to begin with an explosion and then build to a climax . I 'd like to  --  believe me , I 'd like to  --  but this particular story happened just the other way round . *** It was a good climax , at least . Well , okay , maybe that 's a silly statement . Perhaps you feel that there is no such thing as a bad climax ; that some are better than others , is all . I could argue the point , but I wo n't . Let 's just agree with Woody Allen that " The worst one I ever had was right on the money , " stipulate that they 're all at least okay , and try to quantify the matter a bit . On a scale of ten , then , rating " the least enjoyable orgasm I 've ever had " as a One , and " reaching the culmination of hours of foreplay with the sexiest partner imaginable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax I 'm speaking of now was probably about a Nine-Five . This despite the fact that every one of the ingredients I 've named for a Ten were present . The foreplay had been so extensive and inventive ( Groucho , leering : " ... and the aft play was n't so bad either ... " ) that the sun was coming up by the time I was going in the other direction ; my partner was the sexiest woman on the planet , my darling Zoey Berkowitz ; and she was my first real lover ( as opposed to mere sexer ) in more years than I cared to think about . True , we had already been lovers for several months , by then ... but the honeymoon was by no means over . ( In fact , it still is n't . The way I see it , our relationship is really just a single continuous ongoing act of lovemaking , a dance so complex and subtle that we often disengage bodies completely for hours at a time . ) My father used to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my experience . No , what brought the meter down as low as Nine-Five was merely a matter of mechanics . Zoey has never been a small woman , and she was nine and a half months pregnant at the time . Indeed , if I could hop into a time machine and go far enough back into hominid history , I think I could prove my theory that pregnancy is responsible for the evolution of Man As Engineer . ( This might help explain why there are so few female engineers . ) A man who has successfully managed the trick with a mate in the latter stages of pregnancy possesses most of the insights necessary to build a house  --  and a strong motivation in that direction , as well . If inventing math were as much fun , we 'd probably own the Galaxy by now . But I digress ... As I was saying , Zoey and I had solved the Riddle of the Sphinx together one more time , just as enough dawnglow was sneaking past the edges of the curtains to let us see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to any damn imaginary scoring judges  --  we were both well content , if a little fatigued . By the time we had our breath back , the day was well and truly begun : birds had begun warbling somewhere outside , and traffic was building up to the usual weekday-morning homicidal frenzy out on Route 25A ( why are they all in such a hurry to get to a place they hate ? ) , a combination of sounds that always puts me right to sleep . That 's probably just where I 'd have gone if Zoey had n't poked me in a tender spot and murmured drowsily , " ... ' cha snickering about ? " I had n't realized I was . In fact , I was n't . " I 'm not , " I said . " I 'm chuckling . " She shook her head . " Unh-unh . I like Snickers better'n Chuckles . " I considered a couple of puns having to do with the physical characteristics and components of the candy named , but left them unspoken . Sexual puns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Definitely not a snicker . " Zoey grimaced , her eyes still glued shut . " But why ? Are you . " " Oh , it 's just this silly mental picture I get after we make love , " I admitted . " I keep seeing little Nameless floating in there , startled awake by this rhythmic earthquake ... then staring in fascination as all these millions of confused , exhausted , disappointed little wigglers show up , looking everywhere for an egg . I 'll bet they tickle . The little tyke must get a chuckle out of it . " " Or a chortle , " she agreed , chortling sleepily . " I will too  --  f'now on . Thanks . Neat image . " She yawned hugely then , so of course I did too , and we did the little bits of physical backing and filling necessary to move from Cuddling to Snuggling , and we 'd probably both have been comfortably asleep together in only another minute or two . But we had forgotten about the Invisible Machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many of them seem to be simple pressure-switches . For instance , there 's one underneath most toilet seats : your weight coming down on the seat somehow causes the phone to ring . ( Unless you 've brought the phone in with you : in that case the switch cues a Jehovah 's Witness to knock on your door . ) There 's another one built into most TV remote controls , wired into the channel-select button : if you try to browse , it somehow alerts every station on the the air to go to commercial . The most maddening thing about these switches is that , being of Murphy , they 're unreliable : you ca n't be sure whether or just when they will function , except that it will usually turn out in retrospect to have been the most annoying possible moment . So the tiny pair of switches under my eyebrows , sensing that I was just about to drop off to sleep , picked now to send out the signal that causes my alarm clock to ring . Excuse me  --  I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past two weeks that damned thing had been going off at just this ungodly hour  --  set by mine own hand and with Zoey 's foreknowledge and consent  --  and every single time it came as a rude and ghastly surprise . Neither of us could get used to it . I had been a professional musician for a quarter of a century until I gave it up to tend bar ; Zoey still was one  --  or had been right up until carrying both a baby and a bass guitar got to be too much for her ; it had been decades since either of us had willingly gotten up at dawn . Dawn was what you occasionally stayed up as late as . Sunlight gave you the skin cancer , everybody knew that . Civilians got up at dawn , for heaven 's sake . Well , so do **30;477;TOOLONG women . And their partners . No matter what their normal sleep-cycle is. *** Being more than nine months pregnant may mean nothing at all . Not even when you get up to nine and a half months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you just guessed wrong on the conception date . We do n't want you to worry , Ms. Berkowitz . But maybe , just maybe something is wrong in there . Maybe little Nameless does n't want to come out and play , ready or not . If so , it is a bad decision , however one might sympathize  --  because once Nameless is ready , he or she will begin to do what all fully formed babies do best : excrete . And , polluting the womb , will die . And probably take you along for company . The chances of this are indeterminate ... but it might be wisest if you just checked into the hospital now , Ms. Berkowitz , and allowed us to induce labor with a pitocin drip ... Zoey had awarded that offer an emphatic " Fuck you very much , Doctor , " and I was behind her a hundred percent . At the time . We had both devoured most of the available literature on birthing as a subversive activity , and were determined to Do This Naturally  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way our primitive ancestors did it in the caves : with a trained Lamaze partner , a camcorder , and a physician standing by just in case . As far as we were concerned , Nameless could emerge in his or her own good time . The hospital had seen all too many zealots like us ; they sighed and agreed to let us wait as long as we could stand it , against advice ... provided we were willing to furnish daily proof that Nameless was not in fact dying in there . In the form of a maternal urine sample . Which they would need first thing in the morning . Every morning . Wherefore : Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ! ! ! ! ! *** As far as I can see , the only disadvantage to having a pregnant lady around the home is that it 's always your turn to get up . I said a few words , and Zoey stuck an elbow in my ribs , saying , " Not in front of the baby ! " So I said some more words , but in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went around the bed , I confirmed by eye that her chamber pot was placed where she would be able to conveniently straddle it , and went to the bathroom to get another specimen container from the package under the sink . ( If you think ten yards is too short a walk to the bathroom for a chamber pot to be necessary , you 've never been nine and a half months pregnant . ) And then ... well , it got complicated . I bent over , see , and took the package by a scrap of torn flap at the top , and straightened up , intending to rummage inside the thing for a specimen container once I got it up to around waist level . But Zoey had been pregnant for nine months and thirteen days , and those damn packages hold a dozen ... so it was empty ... and since it was empty , it did n't weigh anything ... and since I was expecting it to weigh at least something , and was more than a little groggy ... well , I overbalanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the tile wall . It could have happened to you , okay ? Sure , it did n't , and never will ... but it could have . And if it had , I would n't have laughed at you . Oh all right , I 'm lying . Go ahead . Zoey had apparently decided to rest her eyes until I got back , and then get up into a sitting position , when there was someone there to help . But her love was true : I believe the combination of my piteous wail and the loud reverberating boom were probably enough to cause at least one of her eyes to open , perhaps as much as halfway . " You alive , hon ? " she murmured . I was dazed , and not honestly sure of the answer , but I could not ignore the concern in her voice . " Depends on what you call living , " I temporized , trying with little success to get out of the tub . Her reply was a snore . My struggles triggered another of those invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of an unsuspecting human in its target area , and cut loose with the half-cup or so of ice-water it keeps handy for such occasions , scoring a direct hit on my groin . That got me up out of the bathtub , at least , though I ca n't explain exactly how ; all I know is , an instant later I was standing up and drawing in breath to swear . Loudly . With a great effort I managed to squelch it . The useless empty paper sack that should have held specimen jars was still in my hand ; I flung it angrily toward the wastebasket beyond the toilet bowl . But of course it had poor aerodynamic characteristics for a projectile : it fluttered and flapped and curled over and fell short , square into the toilet bowl . Two points . This time I was not entirely successful in suppressing my bark of rage ; it emerged as a kind of moan . I turned angrily on my heel , and walked straight into the edge of the open bathroom door . The sun went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was sitting again , on the cold tile floor this time . The front of my head now hurt as much as the back , and my buttocks hurt twice as much . Outside in the bedroom , Zoey snored again . For the third time , my lungs sucked in air ... and then let it out again , very slowly . If I woke Zoey with screamed curses , I 'd have to explain why  --  and then refrain from strangling her while she giggled . Or chortled . I got up , rubbed the places that hurt , and turned my attention to the problem of improvising an alternate urine container . If it had been for myself or another male , no problem  --  but females need a wider aperture . I shuffled past the sleeping Zoey and left the bedroom , searching for inspiration . By the time I found it , I had left our living quarters completely and wandered out into Mary 's Place proper . Living in back of a tavern has been a lifelong dream of mine , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined . There , for instance , ranked in rows behind the bar , were a plethora of acceptable receptacles . ( Say that three times fast with marbles in your mouth and you 'll never need a dentist again . ) Before selecting one , I punched a combination into The Machine and set a mug upright on its conveyor belt , which hummed into life and whisked the mug away . Less than a minute later it emerged from the far side of The Machine , filled now with fresh hot Tanzanian Peaberry coffee adulterated to my taste . I took it and the container I had chosen back into the bedroom . There are few things a very pregnant woman will wake up for , but peeing is definitely one of them . Getting Zoey to a sitting position on the side of the bed ( without tipping over the chamber pot ) was probably less difficult than portaging a piano . The smell of coffee must have helped . She took a long sip of it , then came fully awake when she recognized the receptacle I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeing into a stein . " " Oh hell , Zoey , what 's its religion got to do with anything ? It 's wide enough , it 's got a lid I can tape shut after , we 're out of specimen jars , just go ahead and get it over with , okay ? Whoever it is today will be here any minute . " My best friends in the world  --  a.k.a. my regular clientele  --  had organized what they insisted on calling a Pee Pool : each morning one of them took a turn at coming by Mary 's Place to pick up the day 's specimen and ferry it to the hospital for analysis . I had no idea whose turn it was today , and was too groggy to figure it out , but the way things were going I suspected it would be one of the rare prompt ones . Zoey thought it over , decided that peeing in a stein was preferable to rising to her feet and waddling all the way to the dunny , and relaxed to the inevitable . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without stepping over her , deployed the stein , and cut loose . Sure enough , just as she finished , there was a thunderous knocking . A distant thunderous knocking  --  at the bar 's front door . That irritated me . Whoever it was could have just as easily come around to this side of the building and knocked on the much-closer back door . As a gesture of my irritation , I tossed aside the underpants I had just managed to locate , snatched the filled stein out of Zoey 's hand , and set off to answer the knock stark naked . " Jake  --  " Zoey called after me , and I snarled , " Whoever it is has it coming , " over my shoulder . For the second time that day I padded out of the living area and into the bar , went through the swinging doors into the foyer , and flung open the outside door with a flourish . And was vouchsafed a vision . *** It had to be a vision . Reality , even the rather plastic kind I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not  --  I felt  --  produce a sight like that . Nor was it a mere hallucination : I had not had a drink in many hours , or a toke in several days . The thing was so weird that it took me a full second or two to learn to see it : at first my brain rejected what it was given and searched for plausible alternatives . This object is a fireplug  --  no , a fireplug 's older brother  --  over which someone has draped a very used painter 's dropcloth , and onto the top of which someone has placed the severed head of a pitbull . No , wait , pitbulls do n't have mustaches . Perhaps this is the secret midget son of Broderick Crawford , wearing a paint-spattered toga as part of his fraternity initiation . No , I have it now : this is R2-D2 dressed for Halloween . Or maybe  - -  We gaped at each other for a good five seconds of silence , the vision and I , before I tentatively  --  and correctly  --  identified it as the ugliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , I screamed and jumped back a foot  --  and at the exact same instant , she did the exact same thing . *** The difference was , I was holding a nearly full stein . The lid flew open when I started , and a glog of the contents sailed out into the air : an elongated fluid projectile , like a golden version of the second , liquid-metal-model Terminator . It caught her amidships and splattered , the splat-sound overpowered by the clop ! of the stein lid slamming shut again . There was a short pause , and then she barked . I mean barked , like a dog . In fact , yapped is closer to the sound she made  --  but does n't begin to convey the impact . Even " barked " is n't strong enough . Maybe " bayed . " Imagine a two-hundred-pound Pekingese with a bullhorn , and you 've only started to imagine that sound . It was something like all the fingernails in the world being drawn across all the blackboards in Hell and then amplified through the Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather like a dog myself , blinked rapidly without effect , and felt my testicles retreating into my trunk . The vision barked again , louder  --  a sound which you can duplicate for yourself if you wish by simply inserting a power drill into each ear simultaneously . As its echo faded , I heard the distant sounds of Zoey approaching to investigate . She pushed the swinging doors open and joined me in the foyer  --  stopped short and gaped . The ... I was finally beginning to believe it was a human woman , or something like one ... gaped back at the two of us , staring from the naked hairy man to the pregnant woman in the ratty bathrobe . She opened her mouth to bark again , paused , blinked , looked down at the damp stain on her chest , sniffed sharply  --  the sight of her hairy nostrils flaring will go with my to my grave  --  glared up at me , then at the stein in my hand , then back at me , then down at the stain on her chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally she threw back her head and howled . A couple of glasses burst behind the bar . I heard them just before my hearing cut out completely , as though God had accidentally overloaded the automatic level control on my tape deck . I know I tried to scream myself , but do n't know whether I succeeded . I also tried to jam my fingers into my ears , to stop the pain that continued long after actual hearing had fled . Not only did n't it help a bit , the stein I had abandoned to do so landed squarely on my bare right foot , with a crunch that I did hear , by bone conduction , and sprayed the last of its contents onto the creature 's hirsute shins , pilled socks and orthopedic shoes . A pity , for it caused her to sustain her howl longer than she might have otherwise , and to shake at me a fist like a small wrinkled ham . Horrible as that shriek was  --  and it was , even without being audible  --  the end of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath for the next one , and so I saw her teeth . I can see them now . My eyes sent my brain an urgent message asking how come they had to stay on duty when my ears had already bugged out . With that , my Guardian Idiot snapped out of his stupor , and reminded me that I did not have to endure this trial any longer than I chose to . I closed the door quietly but firmly in her face . Then I stood on one leg and cradled my mashed foot in both hands and hopped in pain . Then I lost my balance and fell down , for the third time that morning , on my bare ass , banging my head again too . ( For those of you who are connoisseurs of anguish , a hardwood floor is perceptibly harder than either tub or tile . ) Zoey , bless her , did the only thing she could : she fell down laughing , and landed beside me on the foyer floor . I did not join her in laughing . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if age can not wither nor custom stale my Zoey , no glare of mine is going to do the trick . Then I thought about kicking her , somewhere that would n't endanger Nameless  --  but now was not a good time to get beat up . Next I opened my mouth to say something  --  deeming it safe because I assumed she was still as deafened as me by the vision 's banshee cry . But before I could , I realized that the deafness must have worn off : I could hear Zoey 's hoots of helpless hysteria , now , and the distant and fading sound of that monstrous barking outside . So I closed my mouth , prepared a slightly less offensive speech , opened my mouth again ... and clearly heard the sound of knocking . Distant knocking . Not here  --  but at the back door , back in the bedroom ... where one of my friends must be waiting to receive the daily beaker of piss . Now I joined Zoey in laughing . I just had to . It was that or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed until our sides hurt . The louder and more urgent the distant knocking became , the harder we laughed . Finally we got up , still giggling , collected the empty stein , and went to answer the knock . *** " What the hell was that ? " Zoey asked as we walked back to our quarters , wiping away tears of laughter with the hand that held the stein . " I think it was a person , " I said . " I 'm pretty sure it was a life form of some kind , anyway . " " If you say so . I wonder what in God 's name she wanted . What language was that she speaking ? " " I 'm not sure she was evolved that far . Come on , hurry up , or  --  " Needless to say , by the time we got to the back door to answer the knock , the knocker  --  Noah Gonzalez  --  had given up and gone round to the front door . I left Zoey there and retraced my steps  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front door moments after Noah had given up and gone round to the back door again . That 's it I thought , I quit . I went as far as the bar , made a second cup of coffee , and vowed not to move another step until I had finished drinking this one . Zoey and Noah must have connected , and worked out for themselves the awkward business of him waiting in the bedroom while she waddled into the bathroom and refilled the stein for him . By the time she came out to find me , carrying my bathrobe , I was putting the finishing touches on the lyrics of a new song . It goes like this : God has a sense of humor , but it 's often rather crude What He thinks is a howler , you or I would say is rude But cursing Him is not a real productive attitude Just laugh  --  you might as well , my friend , ' cause either way you 're screwed I know : it sounds so simple , and it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you God loved Mort Sahl , Belushi , Lenny Bruce  --  He likes it sick Fields , Chaplin , Keaton ... anyone in pain will do the trick ' Cause God 's idea of slapstick is to slap you with a stick : You might as well resign yourself to stepping on your dick It always sounds so simple , but it 's so hard to do To laugh when the joke 's on you You can laugh at a total stranger When it is n't your ass in danger And your lover can be a riot  --  if you learn how to giggle quiet But if you want the right to giggle , that is what you got ta do when the person steppin on that old banana-peel is you A chump and a banana peel : the core of every joke But when it 's you that steps on one , your laughter tends to choke Try not to take it personal , just have another toke as long as you ai n't broken , what 's the difference if you 're broke ? I know : it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To laugh when the joke 's on you It can be hard to force a smile , as you get along in years It is n't easy laughin at your deepest secret fears But try to find your funny-bone , and have a couple beers : If it do n't come out in laughter , man , it 's comin out in tears I said it sounds so simple , but it 's so hard to do To laugh when the joke 's on you The barking vision did not return , that day . Within ten minutes , Zoey and I had crawled back into bed , where we would enjoy a sound and undisturbed sleep , and nothing else awful or astonishing was to happen after that until well after sundown . But  --  had we but known it  --  the ending of Mary 's Place had already begun .
