<p> There were times when Julius Jones and his big brother , Thomas , had difficulty falling asleep in the small bedroom they shared as young boys . They often lay wondering if their mother , Betty , would make it out into the sunshine from the dark and dangerous coal mine where she worked for so many years , whether she would be there when they came home from school and football practice . They worried about cave-ins , fires , all the accidents they had heard about growing up in this tiny southwestern Virginia town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains . <p> " It was tough knowing that your mom could be down there miles under the ground and something bad could happen , " Julius Jones said . " She 'd go down there wearing that light on her helmet , pads on her knees and her elbows . She did what everyone else did in the mine . It was hard work . We knew what she did . We knew what sacrifices both our parents made for all of us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Julius Jones , the running back on whom the Dallas Cowboys are pinning their hopes for the future . And for Thomas , 27 , who is the starting running back for the Chicago Bears . The two huddled earlier in the week to scout the Washington Redskins , Julius 's opponent Monday night and Thomas 's last weekend . That 's nothing new , though . Thomas has been there for Julius virtually at every step since leaving Big Stone Gap ( population 5,900 ) . <p> " It 's pretty crazy that both of us made it all the way here when you think about it , " said Thomas , who was a running back at the University of Virginia . " That feeling never wears off . I 'm still kind of amazed that we both made it to the NFL , because this is what we always dreamed about . I do n't think it 's so much a coincidence that we both got there , because we helped each other make it here . We run pretty much the same way . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like having two people go through the same thing , and that 's always stronger than just one . " <p> But more than just two people are behind their success . Both acknowledge the sacrifices their father , Thomas A. Jones  --  known as Big Thomas  --  and Betty , his wife of 33 years , have made over the years . The brothers also have five sisters , including Julius 's twin , Knetris , as well as an extended family of friends , teachers and coaches who helped nurture them . <p> Diane Bruner , their seventh-grade civics and American history teacher , described them as being " a lot more focused than many seventh-grade boys I 've ever been around . It 's a success story small towns like ours rarely see , and give all the credit to their parents . They monitored everything those children did . They have a family closeness that is unreal . " <p> Barry Jones , no relation to the family , taught Thomas and Julius as kindergartners in gym class , then coached them at Powell Valley High School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recalled , was always more talkative than Julius , but he could tell almost from the first time he saw them play simple children 's games that both had a chance to be special . <p> " I can remember Thomas in the fourth or fifth grade saying , ' I 'm going to play in the NFL some day , ' " Barry Jones said . " They were both straight-A students . They were focused , worked hard in school and worked hard to get where they are today . It 's just a great story . " <p> It 's also a story with deep roots in the once-thriving coal business that first put this town on the map during an early boom in the 1870s , when , according to the Southwest Virginia Museum , some northern businessmen thought Big Stone Gap might even become the Pittsburgh of the South . <p> " It 's embedded in the people of this area , " Big Thomas said . " For a long time , it was the heartbeat of the community . " <p> Both Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1940s looking for a better way of life . They found it in the mines , settling in a tiny coal camp known as Stonega . Big Thomas 's father spent 47 years in the mines , Betty 's dad 35 years . <p> Big Thomas and Betty 's late brother , Edd Clark , played in the same backfield at Appalachia High . Edd held the Virginia Class A state record for rushing yards in a game until his nephew Thomas gained 462 yards one night in 1994 . Edd was known as the " Stonega Stallion " in the late 1960s , and went to Purdue on a football scholarship . He lasted only a year and eventually came back home to drive a coal truck . In 1986 , on vacation in South Florida , he drowned in an ocean undertow while trying to rescue two children . He got one of them out of the water , but died trying to save the second . <p> Big Thomas and Betty say they also learned a valuable lesson from Edd 's decision to attend Purdue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they allowed Edd 's football coaches to steer him toward West Lafayette . <p> " Even before Thomas was born , we said to each other that if we ever had a boy and he wanted to pursue football , we 'd make sure he would do it the right way , and not be influenced by anyone but us , " Big Thomas said . " When it came down to our two boys , we wanted them to make sure that academics was the first priority . It was never about the ball for these two . It was always about the books . " <p> Big Thomas had gone from high school to a six-year stretch in the Air Force . When he got out , he went to a broadcasting school in Ohio and eventually landed a job as a disc jockey and news director for a local radio station here . He and Betty married in 1972 and six years later , they had three children . Betty held down an office job , but they were having a hard time making ends meet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hiring miners , both Big Thomas and Betty applied , thinking they 'd only work for a few years while building up a nest egg . <p> But Betty stayed on the job for 19 years , working the third shift from midnight to 8 a.m. so she 'd have time during the day and evening to be a part of her children 's lives . She finally stopped in 1998 . Big Thomas was one of 200 men laid off by the coal company after a year , but he found work as a TV reporter and anchor , followed by stretches as a minority recruiter for the University of Tennessee and a corrections officer in a nearby state prison . <p> Both are now retired and live in a handsome , modern house Thomas helped build for them with some of his signing bonus as a first-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals in 2000 . They live two miles from town , with a stunning view of the mountains , and run their own business selling mail-order music CDs to inmates through a catalogue distributed in all 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area all their lives , but they are also delighted their adult children , all college graduates , have moved away . Only 17-year-old Katrice is still around , in her junior year and a star volleyball player for Powell Valley . <p> Big Thomas and Betty do not expect their kids to come back to a town that still seems straight out of the 1950s , despite the Wal-Mart and McDonald 's just off Highway 23 . Most of the mines have closed in recent years , though several nearby prisons have taken up some of the employment slack . Churches , mostly Baptist , seem to be on every corner . The four-block downtown includes a Chinese restaurant , a Christian teen center and businesses such as Sue 's Hallmark and Judy 's Hodge Podge . And at the back of the Mutual drugstore on Wood Avenue , the main street , breakfast and lunch are served cafeteria-style , with an order of spaghetti and meat sauce , apple cobbler and a large Coke still bringing change from a $5 bill . <p> Powell Valley High , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building located on the outskirts of town . Hall lockers of all the current football players are easily discernable because cutouts of their jersey numbers are taped on the front , along with messages of good luck . Color pictures of Thomas and Julius are prominently displayed in packed trophy cases down by the gym , along with much of the hardware the two helped collect , including state championships in 1994-95 during Thomas 's last two years , and two more in Julius 's final two seasons ( 1997-98 ) before he went off to Notre Dame . Both played on teams that went 28-0 in their last two years . <p> Still , there is no mention of their exploits down at Bullitt Park , Powell Valley 's home field at the base of Stone Mountain , where standing-room crowds of 7,500 were not unusual when the Jones brothers played . The Jones family lived in a rented house a few blocks away when the boys were growing up . They wore out the swings and seesaws in a park named after a long-gone coal magnate , Joshua Taggart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park under the tutelage of Bob Herron , who has coached many of the town 's 8-12-year-olds for 38 years . <p> " I think Thomas was 7 when I got him , and he was like a gazelle out there , floating all over the field , " Herron said . " Julius was more of a slasher , maybe had a little more speed . It 's easy to say now , but I always had it in my mind they had a chance to be special . They both worked hard at it from the first day I got them , and the parents were always there , always supporting them , doing whatever they could . They 've got a bunch of great kids , and you have to give the parents all the credit you can . " <p> Never was the importance of family more obvious than during one of the rare hiccups in Julius 's career at Notre Dame . In what should have been his senior season , he was ruled academically ineligible . Julius and the family decided it would be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinals , and enrolled at Arizona State . <p> " It was devastating to him and to us as a family , " Big Thomas said . " Betty and I went to South Bend , and at least they left a window open for him to get it fixed . This was the first time we as a family had faced this kind of adversity , and we rallied behind him . All of us . " <p> Julius and Thomas lived and trained together for the year , and Notre Dame eventually accepted Julius 's ASU work and reinstated him to full eligibility for 2003 . Julius made the most of it , gaining more than 1,200 yards , scoring 10 touchdowns and setting a school record by running for more than 200 yards in three games . In April 2004 , the Cowboys took him in the second round ( 43rd overall ) of the draft . And he graduated from Notre Dame . <p> Julius 's first year with the Cowboys was another test of his character . Coach Bill Parcells lit into him in preseason when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and suffering a bruised rib  --  in a game against Tennessee . When Jones fractured the scapula in his shoulder in the second game of the regular season , the team decided not to put him on injured reserve . When he got healthy , Jones started the final seven games , gained 819 rushing yards and scored seven touchdowns , all on the ground , providing great hope for a re-built Dallas offense . <p> Restoring the Cowboys ' glory is a lofty dream , but dreaming is something Julius learned to do in Big Stone Gap . <p> " My parents worked hard and I know the sacrifices they made for all of us , " he said . " I think growing up there was a good thing , too . There was never a whole lot of trouble you could really ever get into . Other than my dad , Thomas and I were the only boys in the house , so we had to stick together , us against the five girls . We did everything together .
