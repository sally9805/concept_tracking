LARRY HAVARD HAD SPENT almost every free weekend of his life hunting in the woods of his home county in South Mississippi , but for almost a month now , at age thirty-six , he had n't had the heart to kill one thing . Not after his house caught fire and he lost the best bird dogs he 'd ever owned or heard of , two full-blooded retrievers , to smoke inhalation . <p> Yesterday he 'd even flinched at his uncle Posey 's hog-killing . He 'd actually felt sorry for the hog when his aging uncle kept losing his aim  --  taking four tries to finally hit the brain and put the squealing thing down on the trailer floor . <p> His poor , suffering bird dogs , King-Size and Copperhead , was the only thought his mind could muster . And that scared Larry . Not since perhaps his seventh birthday , when the first blast of his new single-shot twelve-gauge thrust the stock under his arm and the hammer snagged his cheek , had he sympathized with any dying creature . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could n't bring himself to kill . <p> That 's why he cut out of work early today to go to the shelter . Maybe he 'd luck up on a couple of healthy Lab pups or maybe a beagle bitch primed for coon . But all Larry found on either side of the kennel walkway was what the dogcatcher had promised : nippers , lungers , and broken dogs with mange or missing parts . A few yard dogs in the bunch , sure , but not one up-and-comer . Not one that was the least bit alert or even tame . Every hunter he knew penned his dogs up and starved them to keep them wild and forever ready , but would eventually run them to death or lose them in the woods . Larry had been the same way until he 'd discovered that the more he tamed King-Size and Copperhead with rewards , the longer they 'd run , and they 'd always come back . A pooch might not be smarter than a human , but Larry swore it was n't dumber . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wavy  --  haired something-or-other backed in a corner , he stooped and wiggled a finger through the chain-link . He expected the dog to raise its nose to check him out , at least its black , stunned eyes to blink . He never expected his finger would scare it and make it shake . Even after he 'd drawn back his hand , the dog , an old white poodle with a yellow face , continued to tremble , without once losing its stare , and that reminded Larry of yesterday 's hog . A two-hundred-pounder , solid black except for the white cloud-mark across its back . It too , while staring at Larry , had begun to shake-and just when the kettle water had begun to boil , as if the hog understood . Larry remembered looking away then , his eyes following the rising steam , watching it merge with the smoke from the driftwood fire and pass downwind , above the cow pasture , into the halo of buzzards . <p> The sorrow in the poodle 's eyes made him want to reach out ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog just for petting . But such a notion aggravated him , and he shot up to leave . He had n't come there to pick out a toy . He was full of mud . What in the world was he thinking ? <p> The custodian , who 'd been sanitizing empty cages at the far end of the kennel , was now plodding in waders in Larry 's direction . " Case you 're wanting that poodle there , it 's got heartworms , " he said . " Man brung him in just a while ago to be put down . " <p> Larry shrugged . " Oh , well , " he said , then brushed on past . <p> But minutes later panic lit into him as if he 'd received again the fire department 's call . With his truck still running he hurried back inside , afraid the custodian had already gassed the poor thing . When he neared the cage , fear swept fresh the sight of his huddled , blackened dogs . Yet this , he realized , was a different day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd left him-though completely still now . Not quite serene , but not any more scared either . Almost waiting . <p> Seeing as the dog 's doom was a foregone conclusion , Larry figured he ought to be the one to put it down . By being the one , maybe he 'd conquer his worrisome death tic once and for all . " Yeah , " he said , and he snatched the dog from its cage . <p> Larry drove more slowly than usual on his way home . He even felt comfortable enough to drape his arm across the seat . His wife had moved out nine months ago and gotten the divorce finalized , so it felt good to look over and see a passenger looking back at him . The poodle was old but did n't look that old , not to be dying yet-but here it was , and he was glad . King-Size and Copperhead had always wanted to ride together in the back to lick the wind and bark at passing dogs . Larry usually kept his stereo blaring Cream or Skynyrd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At home , he helped the poodle to the ground and watched to make sure it did n't wander into the yard , where scorched lumber was still strewn , and step on a nail . Then , once it lowered its leg from an impressive seventy-degree hike , Larry picked the old stud-boy up and carried him inside . The poodle sniffed in circles across the kitchen floor while Larry wiped his mustache . He reached under the sink , pulled out the retrievers ' water bowl , and scrubbed away the waves of smoke with his hands and a bar of soap . He rinsed it , dried it with a paper towel , then filled it with cold water . He set the bowl down and stepped back to the refrigerator , and the poodle hesitated over and lapped like frogs leaping from a bank . That 's what it sounded like to Larry , anyway . <p> Larry grinned at the beard of water dripping from the dog 's chin . " You were n't thirsty , were you , boy ? And I bet you ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezer to see what he could cook that was special enough for a last meal . There was plenty left over from his hunting days to choose from , but the pursuit ended when he found a front-quarter shoulder of deer meat . He would n't have wanted anything else if it were his time coming . <p> While the venison T-bone thawed in a sink of hot water , Larry went through the house cutting the lights on in every room so he could reexamine the past month 's work and consider what remained ahead . After he 'd gutted the house of all its wood paneling , carpeting , and melted ceiling tiles and linoleum , replaced the necessary studs , rafters , and floorboards , and painted Kilz over all smoke-damaged wood , he rewired , insulated , and put in new windows , then did for himself what he did for others nearly every day at work . He hung the sheetrock , which he 'd finished nailing up only last night . Tomorrow he 'd begin the floating , his specialty . <p> The process involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape and mud , so that what remained for the painter were level lines from corner to corner , even if the house was n't square . He did n't exactly understand the name . All he could figure was that the person who 'd come up with it must have noticed , as he had , that if you sink yourself to the bottom of Brushy Creek , you 'll see there 's enough , silt and sand in the water to make whatever and whoever floating above appear too vague to be visible . <p> Sometimes people in the community would try hanging their own sheetrock , but nobody but a floater had better float it . Not unless they did n't mind the rows of nail heads showing through on the walls like shirt buttons . If they wanted their rooms to appear seamless and whole , as though one single wall folded into a box , or if they needed enough mud troweled at the top and bottom to make a bowed wall appear plumb , then Larry was the man . And the stage of floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gash-was gently sanding the sheetrock to a smooth finish , once it had dried , with his sandstone , the size of a brick , and watching fine white dust cloud up under the brushing of his stone and fall like snow , and there 'd be banks of it everywhere , along every wall . Real snow had fallen in George County only a few times in his life , and even then it had never completely covered anything . <p> Most of what had been salvaged from the fire was being stored in a friend 's vacant barn , so the only furniture in the house consisted of what Larry 's cousin , the supply sergeant at the National Guard Armory , had loaned him : a field table and a cot , both set up out of the way of the work , in the kitchen . He did n't believe he was ready yet to sleep in the bedroom . He still found himself shaking his head and gazing in dismay at the blackened pine floor where his bed had been . Where he 'd flipped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying side by side , it seemed , to hide from the fire . He 'd lifted their limp heads , touched their pallid tongues , then , with the edge of his boot , had scraped their feces to the wall . <p> After the divorce he 'd started letting his dogs live inside , and his folks were afraid he was losing his mind ; his momma had even sent the preacher to visit him . He was merely protecting his remaining assets , Larry had done his best to explain , to his family and the preacher . But to his buddies , cousins included , who feared those prize bird dogs would become spoiled , he told another story : just trying to run the smell of the ex-wife clean from the house . <p> Larry turned to cut off the bedroom light and spotted little cryface peeking at him from around the corner in the hallway . " Yeah , you 're probably right , " he smiled . He followed the pooch into the kitchen , and sure enough , the T-bone was ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a couple of hot sausage links and boiled a pot of rice for himself . Every once in a while he 'd pop a beer and sit down at the table and eye the poodle , who 'd hopped on the cot and was making himself at home . He liked looking at the dog sometimes , but sometimes he did n't . <p> His own food was ready before the dog 's , so he set it aside under cover . When the T-bone had cooled some , he cut it up and served it on the floor , where he 'd made a clean spot in the dust . " Enjoy , little thing , " he said , and the boy lost all shyness , as if this were his first meeting with the taste of deer . When he 'd devoured the shoulder meat , Larry tossed him the bone . He was proud of himself for giving this dog a last-minute friendly place . He 'd done a good deed , his first in a long time that no one could take from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sink and rummaged in the cupboard until he found the cane syrup . Then he went to his truck for his forty-five and sat back down at the table . The boy was still having his way on the deer bone , and Larry was n't about to take it away . When the boy decided he was done with it , that would be the time . Till then Larry would down as many beers as the dog gave him time to . Which happened to be three . <p> The bone dropped from between his paws as the dog stood and stretched his hind legs . Then he walked to the water bowl . Larry reached into his pocket for his face rag . " Come here , boy , " he said and kissed the air , and the poodle trotted over . He set him on his lap , then wiped the boy 's chin with the rag . " Well , " he said , stroking the dog , " I 'm sorry . " He held him high in the crook of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his beltline . Once he 'd grabbed the syrup can , the empty house echoed with his footsteps . <p> He stopped out back by the toolshed for his spade and flashlight before crossing the yard and entering the unfenced woods , which gently sloped downward from his lot for a quarter-mile . Where it leveled was a place among the clustered pine that a full moon overhead could not penetrate . Where he 'd seen last year from the nearby spring , with the aid of his cousin 's night-vision goggles , two deer mating . Where almost a month ago he 'd dug a hole large enough in which to lay King-Size and Copperhead chest to chest . Where all that could smother a soul was pure pine . <p> Larry knelt beside the washed-out mound of the grave , and on a throw of needles began freeing himself-first of the flashlight , then the shovel ; when the syrup can clanked against the two , the poodle tensed up and locked his forelegs , and his claws dug into Larry 's neck as though the dog had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painless , boy , " Larry said , trying to calm the rigid dog , petting the whole length of him . " Quick and sweet , " he said , " I promise . " He was thinking of the hog he should 've ( and could 've ) killed himself with one shot , but he 'd declined to take his uncle 's rifle , saying a man ought to shoot his own . <p> Larry pulled the poodle to his chest and cradled him as he eased himself to the ground on folded legs . Once he 'd begun again to stroke the dog and talk to him , the dog started to relax in his lap . And with the same ease , he slipped the revolver from his waistband and used its sight to pry the lid off the syrup can . Before the fire , he 'd gotten in the habit of letting the retrievers lick the drippings off the can , and the poodle , craning his bobbing nose to investigate , seemed no less interested . <p> The hunter was an instrument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was helping the poor , dumb animals to survive the worst possible fate : Being shot was ever better than slowly losing breath in the heat of fire . If done without notice and with care . <p> Larry dipped the barrel into the syrup and offered it to the dog , who hesitantly swiped it with the tip of his tongue . " It 's OK , " Larry said , " have all you want . That 's good stuff , " he said , and the dog agreed , returning for more . When the boy 's fast tongue had cleaned the barrel , Larry dipped it again . This time , though , he did n't completely bring it to the dog but held it a half-foot away , and as soon as the dog had begun to lick it , he pulled it slowly away another half-foot , so that the poodle was now totally uprooted from Larry 's lap . When the boy started nibbling the barrel , Larry took the gun away once more and dipped it down to the cylinder . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amber light . Then , rolling onto his back , he stretched his paws to hold onto the dripping gun himself . The dog was really lapping in the cane . And Larry , panting , cocked his head back and , hallelujah , pulled the trigger . <p> That was n't too bad . He was fine . Nothing to it , he told himself . He rose and began shoveling the red clay . He was sure he could hunt again now and was grateful to the boy and said so as he lowered him . <p> Maybe the shelter would have something special for him tomorrow too , he thought . Maybe something he could feed more than once . Something he could name , and a proud name he could holler . On his way back to the house he found himself smiling at the good names he could choose from : Moocher , Kaiser , Biscuit , and Red-Eye , and there 'd come a day , he was sure , when a dog could rightfully be tagged Larry . Larry and Larry . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way it used to be . He dropped by the toolshed , then kicked off his boots at the back door and slung off his jacket . Yeah , he thought , setting the syrup and the forty-five in the kitchen sink , old Larry was back . Only new and improved . <p> He gazed at his cot as he unbuttoned his shirt . Without blinking he continued to undress , to remove his undershirt , and then he paused to follow , with his fingertips , the smooth , thin line that diagonally crossed his obliterated left nipple . He was n't remembering the day a twenty-two cartridge had grazed there nor his now-former hunting buddy . Rather , he was trying to recall the evenings when he 'd sighted the deer that he had not been able to call his own . There had been two , a yearling and a week later a buck . One nuzzling the fallen leaves for acorns and the other turning its four points to the wind . One emerging into open field and one already there . He could remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How he must have appeared to them when he stepped from hiding with his hat clutched at his side . Which lucky flannel shirt had he worn ? How would he know never to wear it again ? <p> He 'd just about decided to forget the matter and take a bath , though , when he heard someone pulling up the gravel drive . He stopped stroking his scar , then smiled at his cousin 's knack of perfect timing . Somehow Stringer 's blood always knew where to lead him , as it had in Desert Storm , and as here , on this big night , probably to spotlight deer in the back woods . But when Larry looked out the window and saw a car instead of a truck , he put his shirt back on and , leaving it unbuttoned , went to the door with his forty-five . <p> When he stepped outside and found a woman seated alone in a four-door , an Accord , Larry tucked his pistol away and leaned against a porch post . He watched the woman , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little that , and then she finally opened her door and asked if he were Larry Havard . <p> " Well , " he said , " now that depends largely on who you are . " <p> She shut the door , and as she approached the porch , Larry admired the nice tossed-up deal with her hair , and her figure was n't too bad either . Her shoes looking top-dollar . <p> " I was told at the animal shelter that you adopted a poodle today  --  a white poodle , about eight years old . Is that right ? " she asked . " Are you that Larry Havard ? This is 2203 Cooks Corner Road , is n't it ? " <p> Larry nodded his head , or thought he did . " And who might you be ? " he asked . <p> " I 'm the owner , " she said . " Puddles-that 's the poodle 's name  --  that 's my dog . " <p> " Do what ? " he said . <p> " They told me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , her eyes dark like his ex-wife 's but bigger , more white to see , and she clasped Larry 's hand inside both of hers . " Believe me , " she said , holding his hand more than shaking it , " I 'd never dump anything of mine in a place like that , especially if it had heartworms . I 've got a neighbor , you see , who plainly detests all newcomers and says so to your face , so I know he 's the one that dropped Puddles off . The people at the shelter described him to a T. So I 'm here to take my dog home now , if you do n't mind , please sir . I 'll pay you for your trouble , of course . " <p> Larry drew away his hand and , almost breathless , fell back against the post and folded his arms . " You 're saying your dog did n't have heartworms , or that he did ? " <p> She smirked . " That dog 's the picture of health , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Easy . " She forked a hand through her hair , giving it a fresh toss , then explained how Puddles spotted a possum in a tree one night and barked an hour straight . And how twice the dog had gotten off his chain and torn into the neighbor 's cheap , thin trash-bags . " He ought to buy a can , " she said , " like everybody else . Those are the reasons he wanted my dog destroyed . Can you imagine ? " Her face slacked , and then , startling Larry , she suddenly clapped her hands and grinned . " So where 's my Puddles at ? " she asked . " Where 's my little baby ? " <p> Larry cleared his throat . " Well , ma'am , " he said , and cleared his throat again . " I did pick your Puddles up and bring him home with me , yes ma'am , I did . And I fed him good too , real good , but I 'm sorry , I 'm terribly sorry , lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror , and he found himself remembering his own and staring into the shadows at the scorched lumber pile . " I had no idea the thing was a little Houdini , " he said . He hooked a thumb over his shoulder . " I chained him out back , but he got loose , just about an hour ago . " He glanced to see how she was taking it , and she was taking it better than he 'd hoped . Almost as if she believed he was lying and the dog was still chained up . " I went looking , " he told her . " Went up this road a dozen times , and all the roads around , but I could n't find him . " She was shaking her head , and he said , " I 'm sorry . I just gave up . " <p> " He could n't be far , though , " she said and bolted to her car . He watched her reach dashward , to the glove compartment , and hop out with a beaming flashlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't find him on a road . He does n't like roads . But woods ? That poodle lives to chase squirrels . " She whipped around and plowed full steam through the side-yard , heading toward his neighbor 's woods . <p> " Hold up , " he called , but she was on course , and who was he to stop her ? He had to go put on his boots and grab his jacket . By the time he 'd done all that and run back out , she was only a slight glow sweeping west . Once he 'd ducked through the barbed wire , he followed a winding trail more memorized than beaten . When the trail began instead to draw him away from her , he thrashed through the trees following the mournful beacon of her dog 's name . And then on higher land ahead he spotted a streak of light . " Miss ? " he said , the briars popping at his jeans , and the light turned and slanted upon the ground and caught him in the eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . <p> He bowed from the glare and flagged her with his hand . The light dropped to an oval at her feet and then was switched off . But he could see her still , above him , her silhouette in the starlight , her shoulders lifting and lowering , and that amazed Larry . He 'd never known until this moment that a person , from twenty or so yards away and with only the naked eye , could be observed breathing . A buck , sure , and any rabbit , but a human ? A woman ? He would n't have guessed . <p> " Are you coming ? " she asked . <p> " Yeah , " he said , pushing on , " I 'm coming . " <p> " I would 've gotten to your house sooner , " she said , " but I did n't know how to find it , and your phone 's not listed . " <p> " I do n't have one , " he said , continuing his climb . " Not at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own sheetrocking business . " <p> " And I got lost , " she said . <p> When he reached her , she was sitting on an uprooted hickory . " My house about burnt to the ground last month because of a faulty breaker , " he told her , and when she kept her face tipped down , he stepped toward the hickory and pulled a clod of dirt from a root of a root and broke it up . " Also , I come to find out the joker who built the house put in the wrong grade of wire , so I ended up losing my two dogs . Two golden retrievers . " <p> She raised her head , but not to look at Larry , who was now sitting on the trunk by the roots . " And though one was bigger , " he said , " and the other more red and was a girl , you could tell it they were twins . That 's why I was at the pound in the first place today-to find me another hunting dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell for your poodle dog . " He chuckled . " But what do you think , " he asked , and she looked at him- " you think your dog , with a little training , could 've made a good squirrel dog ? " <p> She smiled . " He loved to chase squirrels . " <p> He nodded until she turned away and wiped the corners of her eyes with her knuckles . " So where are you from ? " he asked . <p> " Memphis , " she said . <p> " Memphis ! " He whistled . " What in the world brought you all the way down here ? " He watched her trace the crisscrossing pattern of the bark with her fingertips . Then she stopped and began to pick at the bark with her nails . He was starting to think she did n't hear him or had forgotten to speak when she said she was teaching at the high school . " But ai n't they got schools up north ? " he asked . " I mean , why God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in God 's country , " she said . <p> " I see , " said Larry . " I understand . " <p> She flicked her nails together and stood up , brushing her hand against her pants . " So where do we go from here ? " She switched on her light . <p> Thinking they ought to cover the entire wooded radius , he pointed to the southeast , back toward his property , and led the way . He 'd whistle and snap his fingers , and then they 'd alternate and he 'd be the one calling the boy 's name . Every twenty feet they 'd stop and listen for Puddles bounding through the brush or for a distant bark . Sometimes Larry would have to remind himself not to expect too much . <p> When they reached the spring and heard again the dogless night , Larry knelt and scooped water into his mouth . " Have a drink , " he told her . " It 's clean . " But she remained standing , scanning the woods . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do , " she said . " I 'm just curious . I 've always wondered why people hunt . Why , really ? " <p> Larry wiped his mouth on his jacket sleeve . " I can only speak for myself , " he said . <p> " That 's fine , " she said , casting her light over him as he rose to his feet . <p> " No mystery , I do n't think , " he said . " To eat . But I ai n't been eating lately . " <p> Her light stuttered . She shook it , and it burned a little brighter . " But how do you do it ? " she asked . " How do you shoot one animal and then pet on another that 's not that much different ? " <p> He shrugged . " I do n't know . I been wrestling with that lately , and honestly I ca n't figure out how I done that . " <p> She smiled . " I 'm really surprised somebody like you would pick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the trouble and expense already of rebuilding your house ? " She shook her head , and he began to nod . " And heartworm treatment is not cheap . That was amazingly kind of you , you know that ? " <p> Larry was shocked that she would expect him to pay for such treatment . He did n't think holes in the heart should be floated . <p> She bent to the spring . " Very generous , " she said . She smelled the hand she had dipped into the water . Then she dipped again , and this time she drank . Larry pulled out his face rag , and she took it and dried her hand . " Let 's go that way , " she said , darting light over stomped needles and leaves of a trail heading north . There was a more eastward trail , less beaten , he could 've tried steering her to , but he did n't . He was sure she was tracking . <p> She bellowed the boy 's name and forged ahead , but Larry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wondering if he was doing right . When she entered the pine grove , he watched her slow , then tip her light to the red , churned earth and pat her feet in the soil . She turned with a look of question and sorrow . <p> " My dogs , " he said , and she groaned . <p> " I 'm sorry . " She stepped back and let the light linger over the small section of darker earth at the tail end of the grave . " It happened a month ago , you said ? " <p> " Yeah , just a month ago . " She continued to stare at the grave , or study it , and then she looked up and he wondered if she were studying him . " A grave 'll stay fresh a long time in this climate . You 'll get used to it . " He smiled , to ease her , but she dropped her head down , and he could n't tell if she were about to cry or pray . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Somebody could 've found him by now and be taking good care of him . Or he might come strolling up any minute . Little Puddles right now could be having himself a big old ball filling up on squirrel meat , " he said , and waited for her to laugh . When she did n't , he stepped up beside her . <p> " I think we 've searched enough for tonight , " she said , nodding and raising her eyes but still not looking at him . " I can try again tomorrow . " She beamed light on the trees around them . " Where 's the way out of here ? " <p> Larry set his hands on his hips . " I wish I could 've done more for you , though . " <p> She shook her head , and he noticed her whole body was shaking . " I 'm tired , " she said , her voice quavering . " I want to go home . " <p> " OK , sure , of course , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after he 'd squeezed through pines to leave the grove did he hear her make any move to follow . He imagined her hanging back , terrified , and suffocating her cry so he would n't hear it . He thought of how the caulking around his tub still wept soot . He watched her dim light flicker at the ground , then felt it flicker on his face . " I must look like some country demon , huh ? " <p> " Oh , no , " she said . " You do n't . " <p> " If I could back up time and choose the way I could have it , it would n't even be a choice . I might be wrong , but when it comes to finding out tragedy , I 'll take not finding over finding any day . The biggest lie of a hope over a fact any day . " He flung open his arms . " King-Size and Copperhead are actually alive and licking the face of my worst enemy ? Well , good for them . See what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was good that your neighbor lied . You might not have Puddles , somebody else might have Puddles , but who knows , what if the Lord meant for us to meet this way and go out some time , you know ? That 's all I 'm saying . " <p> She panted , then said , " Hmmm . " Or maybe she was clearing her throat to speak . He waited , and when nothing else came , Larry turned and hiked the rest of the way out of the woods . He stopped again , on the open slope of his backyard , so he could see her under the clear sky . <p> " There 's one more thing we can do tonight if you 're up to it , " he said . <p> She shook her head and walked past him . <p> " I got some squirrel meat in the freezer I could fry up right quick , " he said , following her . " I was thinking maybe Puddles might smell it and come a-running . " He snickered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The meat 's got to be ate , and I bet you never ate squirrel before . You ought to try it before there ai n't none . It 's the last thing I ever kill to eat , I swear to you . Killing 's out of my system for good . We 'll make it a feast in our little fellow 's honor . What do you say ? " <p> But she walked on , heading around the house faster than he could follow , and when she reached her car , she slammed her door and locked it and started the engine and backed away in a whip and sped off . <p> Smelling the dust that the Accord had turned up from the drive , he was reminded of the day his ex-wife had made her exit , under similar circumstances , after he 'd given just as many assurances . Maybe he could never really talk to anyone . And then , for a reason that seemed to him otherworldly , he remembered the moment he 'd unleashed King-Size and Copperhead into the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reflections . How , in their delightful confusion , the dogs had growled and wagged their tails at once . <p> He smiled at the memory , and feeling almost drunk from the notion that his dogs had fetched that smile themselves , he lolled his head back and stared at the unfinished ceiling of night , with all its irregular clouds and clusters , and he wished he could strip off his shirt and swim into the sky , to be unseen and forgotten forever . <p> Author Affiliation
