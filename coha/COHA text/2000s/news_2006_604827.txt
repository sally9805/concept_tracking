<p> YPSILANTI , Mich.  --  Look at a map of Ypsilanti and draw your finger along Ford Street and over to the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum , home to obscure cars once built here . Or circle around to Factory Street and Ford Lake , a man-made invention created when Henry Ford brought the promise of hydropower and middle-class wages to the city in the 1930s . <p> There 's no denying Ypsilanti has a history deeply rooted in the auto industry . It was even , at one point , a booming little auto town  --  with a peak population of 29,500 in 1970 . Now , after decades of declining employment in the auto sector , Ypsilanti 's population is down about 25% to an estimated 22,200 in 2004 . Its median household income is $28,000 , 31% below the national average . <p> The question is : Can Ypsilanti survive long enough to turn into something else ? <p> Ypsilanti , on a compact 4 square miles just 35 miles from Detroit , is not the most memorable beleaguered Michigan city . Named after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the name recognition of auto industry towns such as Detroit , Dearborn or Flint . <p> But the problems it faces are indicative of those dogging much of the Rust Belt as the domestic auto industry consolidates in an effort to stay competitive with foreign automakers . <p> When plants close , people move to find new jobs , surrounding businesses fail , and the overall tax base shrinks . Like Ypsilanti , many auto towns are searching for a new industry , if there is one , to replace the lost jobs . Many are shells of what they once were . <p> In Ypsilanti , three of 14 schools have closed . In some neighborhoods , rows of homes sit boarded up . In others , meticulously preserved Victorians sit next to crumbling houses . <p> Ypsilanti 's police force is 27% smaller than in 1997 , and the recreation department is mostly closed . The city has talked about filing for bankruptcy but worries that a state-appointed receiver would sell off assets , such as the city 's snowplows , which no town in Michigan should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're broke . We 're cut to the bone . There 's no place else to cut that really wo n't be felt , " says Cheryl Farmer , Ypsilanti 's mayor for 10 years . <p> An industry disappears <p> In the early 1990s , Ypsilanti had three auto-related plants . Motor Wheel , which made wheel parts , closed its doors in 1997 and moved to Mexico . Exemplar , which made battery cables and fasteners for cars and trucks , went bankrupt in 2002 . <p> General Motors said last month it will close a service and processing plant here in 2006 , eliminating 100 jobs . But the biggest blow will come soon when the city 's biggest taxpayer , Visteon , a parts supplier owned by Ford Motor until it was spun off , plans to close . Nearly 1,000 jobs will move to a Visteon plant in Rawsonville 5 miles away . <p> The plant closing will cost the city $800,000 in tax revenue . The city is facing a $360,000 deficit in 2006 and $1.1 million in 2007 . Officials do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're considering adding a local income tax , but critics argue that will just put more of a hardship on financially struggling city residents . <p> The pain is n't just local . The downturn in the auto industry is rippling through Michigan 's economy , affecting the working poor and urban areas the hardest . Since 2000 , Michigan has lost 313,600 jobs , the vast majority in the auto industry . Another 90,000 jobs are expected to disappear over the next three years . The auto industry is expected to have just 269,000 jobs left by 2012 . <p> Auto production cuts have even hurt those still working because many relied on overtime for up to 30% of their income . That has had another effect on the working poor as many autoworkers try to make up the difference with second jobs . Usually around this time of year , when heating bills climb and Christmas bills are due , health care assistant Yolanda Gonzalez of Ypsilanti lines up a second job assisting at a health care facility to make ends meet . But this year , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of competition for jobs that require only a high school degree and a clean criminal record . <p> " I want to work two jobs , but now it seems like the group home jobs are being snapped up because of all the auto plants , " says Gonzalez , leaving SOS Community Services here looking for help paying utility bills . <p> " It 's not just the auto industry  --  all of the low-skilled jobs are disappearing , " says Faye Askew-King , program director for SOS . " When you have a workforce that is n't really trained , people are n't really prepared for this shift . " <p> Ypsilanti is neighbored by Ann Arbor  --  home to the University of Michigan , which has a world-class hospital and a downtown teeming with shops and galleries . Last year , 156 Ann Arbor residents got help from SOS , while nearly 1,500 Ypsilanti residents sought relief from the agency . Ypsilanti , which is 60% white and 30% African-American , has 25% of its population living under the poverty level , compared with 11.1% for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor people compared to the rest of Washtenaw County , " Askew-King says . " When the market gets tight , they are the ones without employment . " <p> Linda French , owner of the Sidetrack Restaurant in a two-block district called Depot Town , says that in the 27 years she 's been in Ypsilanti , she 's seen the city slowly lose its middle class . Now she 's worried about losing her customer base . The restaurant caters lunches and parties for the Visteon plant , as well as for air freight companies that ship auto parts from the local airport . " They 're all going down the tubes because of this , " she says . " It 's kind of scary . " <p> What happened at Exemplar <p> From the outside , a plain , white building near Interstate 94 does n't look like much . Passersby who look closely can see the dirty shadows left behind when Exemplar peeled its name off the side of the building . It 's a sad reminder that the city is fighting a battle that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Exemplar was a promising minority-owned manufacturing company , which made fasteners and battery cables for the auto industry , among other products . The owners were considering expanding and moving out of the city in 1997 , but city officials cut a deal . They sold Exemplar a 10-acre lot near the interstate for $68,000  --  an 83% discount off the $400,000 asking price  --  and promised to cut its tax rate . The city even used $100,000 in state grants to remake the exit ramps from the highway , making it easier for trucks to get in and out of Exemplar 's building . <p> For a while , things went well at Exemplar . With 110 employees , it was the second-largest taxpayer in Ypsilanti , even with a tax break it got from the city , behind only Visteon . In 2000 , the Ypsilanti Chamber of Commerce named Exemplar CEO Anthony Snoddy the Small Business Person of the Year . <p> But global competition is hard for companies like Exemplar . It 's cheaper to make small parts like fasteners in China or India and ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , GM announced it would no longer buy parts from Exemplar , costing it 60% of its business . It shut its doors in weeks . <p> " It 's all sort of loony , " says Mayor Farmer , still reeling after helping construct the deal that kept Exemplar in town . A couple of offices in the Exemplar building are now being rented , but the majority of it remains empty . Snoddy 's businessperson of the year award still hangs in the vacant lobby . <p> The mayor worries that the lack of manufacturing jobs will hurt not only her city 's economy , but America 's as well . During World War II , Ypsilanti 's car plants stopped making vehicles and began churning out bombers . Rosie the Riveter , used in promotional films for war bonds , was played by Rose Will Monroe , who drove rivets into airplane parts at the Ford plant in neighboring Ypsilanti Township . <p> Now , as the USA ships its manufacturing jobs overseas , Farmer wonders what will happen if the country finds itself facing another wartime shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour that helped with the war , " she says . " Protectionism is not necessarily a bad word . " <p> Lou Glazer , president of the non-profit Michigan Future , says cities like Ypsilanti need to quit giving tax breaks to keep industries . " Enterprises are increasingly less secure because competition is so fierce , " Glazer says . " The fact that they 're here today does not mean they 're going to be here in five years . The main asset a region has is the talent of its people . " <p> It 's all about education <p> But even that might be a struggle for Ypsilanti as schools close . Interim schools Superintendent James Hawkins says the city needed to cut $5.5million out of its $54million budget for the 2005-06 school year . The only way was to close three schools . <p> " Most folks tend to understand because they understand the state of the economy right now , " Hawkins says . " But no one likes the idea of closing schools . " <p> Still , the region has maintained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Eastern Michigan University , and the University of Michigan is less than 10 miles away . <p> Folks like restaurant owner French hope access to the universities will change Ypsilanti into a hip urban center . " We were n't always a factory town , " she says . " We 're in historical times now . We 're seeing factories close , but Ypsilanti might end up being better off . "
