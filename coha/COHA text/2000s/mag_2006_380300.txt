Sam Alito wanted a bigger job , but he had a problem . The 35-year-old graduate of Princeton and Yale was working at the Justice Department in 1985 at the height of conservative euphoria over the re-election of Ronald Reagan . But he was not part of what was known as the " secret handshake " crowd-the Administration 's tight-knit cadre of Reaganite true believers . He had been one of the young lawyers from lite schools hired without regard to their political leanings by the Solicitor General 's office . The Reaganauts suspected many of the career lawyers were liberals hoping to block Reagan 's ideas . Worse , Alito had not even worked on the President 's campaign or donated money , two tests of loyalty for high-level posts in any Administration . <P> Still , some at Justice got the impression through informal conversations that Alito was more conservative than he let on , although he rarely talked directly about politics . And they admired his approach to the law . In a department in which even some Reagan disciples were worried that colleagues focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their claims , Alito diligently researched every issue , wrote clearly and avoided ideological traps . " I was just very impressed by the disciplined nature of his mind , " says Chuck Cooper , a Justice Department official at the time . " He could view a legal issue as objectively and as neutrally as anyone I have ever met . " <P> So when Cooper was named to head the department 's Office of Legal Counsel , he immediately thought of Alito to be one of his deputies . The office functions almost as a law firm within the Executive Branch , offering legal advice on the various ideas coming from other presidential aides-the perfect post for a man who focused more on the fine points of jurisprudence than on politics . This was a chance for a big step up . The question was , Could he be trusted ? <P> Alito was given a test . As part of applying for the job , he was asked to write an essay attesting to his ideological credentials . " I am and always have been a conservative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight words , along with a note that he was " particularly proud " of memos he had written suggesting limits to affirmative action and abortion rights , Alito sealed the promotion . <P> He also set the stage for a high-stakes political battle when George W. Bush named him to the Supreme Court two decades later . As Alito 's confirmation hearings kick off on national television this week , Senators and viewers will be asking , Is this the man of the memos , whose paper trail includes provocative passages against abortion and in favor of Executive power that have given Democrats and liberal interest groups the ammunition to portray him as a dangerous activist ? Or would the high court be getting the more opaque and reserved scholar described by friends and co-workers and suggested by some of his later work ?
