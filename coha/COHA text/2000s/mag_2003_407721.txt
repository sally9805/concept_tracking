Vitamins : What You Really Need to Take Are vitamin and mineral supplements key for good health ? Here , the most up-to-date findings , plus the truth about which are the most effective // Do vitamin and mineral supplements offer benefits ? Yes , says Walter C. Willett , M.D. , chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health . Though outright vitamin and mineral deficiencies are rare in the United States , evidence suggests that making sure we achieve the daily value ( DV ) of certain nutrients-derived from the recommended dietary allowances ( RDAs ) of the Food and Nutrition Board ( FNB ) of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences-may help prevent illnesses like heart disease and certain cancers . For more information , log on to **32;783;TOOLONG . Which vitamin or mineral is most beneficial to my overall health ? The multivitamin/mineral supplement . Since few of us choose our food wisely enough for optimum nutrition , a multi helps to fill in the gaps . Choose a brand that supplies 50 to 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minerals , especially folic acid , calcium , iron ( for premenopausal women ) , selenium , zinc and vitamins B6 , B12 and E , says Paul R. Thomas , Ed.D. , R.D. , publisher of The Dietary Supplement newsletter . If you consume a substantial amount of fortified foods ( one serving of Total cereal , for example , provides 100 percent of the DV for 12 vitamins and minerals ) , opt for the lower end of the DVs . Otherwise , go higher . Is one specific brand of multi superior to others ? ConsumerLab.com , an independent website overseen by a former FDA chemist and a physician , looked at 27 brands of multis for a number of criteria , including whether contents matched the label and disintegrated properly . Eighteen met the criteria , including Nature Made Essential Balance and Theragran-M . In addition to multis , ConsumerLab.com reviewed 11 separate vitamin and mineral supplements , including calcium and vitamin E. Can a multi-or any supplement-make up for a poor diet ? No . Food contains important things you can not get in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which work together to help maintain good health . In addition , while experts basically know how food is absorbed , megadoses of certain nutrients can affect the absorption of others . Do I need to take more than a multi ? Probably , but how much more depends on whom you ask . According to Jeffrey Blumberg , Ph.D. , professor of nutrition at Tufts University , calcium is the most crucial additional supplement for women of all ages , since it helps prevent osteoporosis . Take one to two tablets ( 500 or 600 mg each ) per day , depending on your dairy intake . If you 're under 50 , choose a brand that contains 200 IU of vitamin D , which helps your body absorb the calcium . If you 're over 50 , choose a brand with 400 IU . Also consider taking 400 IU of vitamin E per day . Some evidence suggests that vitamin E may reduce the risk of Alzheimer 's and possibly coronary heart disease . However , some trials have not proven these findings to be conclusive ; research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age should take a vitamin supplement containing 0.4 mg of folic acid daily in case a pregnancy does occur . Are there any supplements I do not need ? Vitamin C is probably unnecessary , says Willett . Some trials have suggested that taking it at the onset of a cold may reduce the duration of symptoms , but consistently taking high doses does n't appear to prevent colds . The FNB advises postmenopausal women to avoid iron supplements and iron-fortified foods , since these women no longer lose iron monthly . Can I take too much of a vitamin ? This is an increasing concern , as more foods become fortified and more dietary supplements are utilized , explains Allison A. Yates , Ph.D. , R.D. , director of the FNB . In response , the FNB has recently formulated ULs-tolerable upper-intake levels . The adverse effects of overdoing some vitamins-for example , an upset stomach after a lot of vitamin C-disappear after the supplements are no longer taken . But others may be more permanent . For instance , one recent study found that long-term use of vitamin A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip fractures in women . Currently , it might be tough to find multis with little or no retinol vitamin A , but some companies are reformulating their products in light of this and other findings , so keep an eye on the labels . For now , choose a brand that offers only half the DV or most of its vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene , which is converted into vitamin A only as needed . <p>
