Headnote Countering the effects of today 's negative images of young African-American females // AMONG African-American girls , the problem of low self-esteem has been fueled by an onslaught of negative influences , including those in magazines , gangsta-rap movies , music videos and hard-core lyrics that degrade women . To offset that negativity , Tara Madison , like some other parents , insists that her 15-year-old daughter , Tyler , reads books by respected Black female authors such as Zora Neale Hurston . Additionally , she and her daughter frequent museums , bookstores and cultural events . Further , Tyler has been encouraged to take violin lessons and to study French so , according to her mother , she can think beyond the hip-hop culture . BE A GOOD ROLE MODEL Like Tara Madison , many African-American mothers are raising Black girls alone for a number of reasons . For example , Culpatrice Foster is a single mom from Dayton , Ohio , raising her 6-year-old daughter , LaRashia Simone Edwards , an aspiring model and actress who has appeared in local TV commercials and has started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to assist other kids . For Foster , like Madison , she realizes the importance of being a good role model for her daughter and not sending her mixed signals . She is not married to LaRashia 's father and refuses to live with him ( or any other man ) unless they are married . " What am I teaching her if I shack with her daddy ? " says Foster , who works on developing LaRashia 's self-esteem by limiting the amount of TV that the youngster watches and by helping her daughter develop her talent as an entertainer . " I do n't drink . I do n't smoke . I do n't have cable television ; there is too much booty-shaking . " ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE Dr. Gail Wyatt , a psychologist and director of the sexual health program at the University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , says parents should make a concerted effort to focus on their children 's African heritage and accentuate its positive aspects . " To just say " Black is beautiful " really does n't fly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . Experts also suggest that parents help foster more positive reinforcement in their daughters through mentoring programs such as the Detroit-based DFVAs4Life ( Determined , Inspired , Victorious , Adventurous ) . The program focuses on 25 girls , ages 8 through 18 , exposing them to social and cultural experiences that include such activities as etiquette classes and opera outings . It has proven to be a model for some other effective programs that have come into being . " I wanted to expand their horizons , " says Jocelyn Alien , founder and executive director of DFVAs4Life . " They need to know that there is a whole world out there beyond what they see on BET and going to the mall to hang out . " COMBAT NEGATIVE MEDIA IMAGES Even with a good male role model is in the home , negative media images can be tough for parents to explain and eventually curtail . For example , Curtis Benjamin , executive director of It 's Cool To Be Smart , Inc. , was outraged by the number of negative images of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show on BET . He was especially incensed because his 14-year-old daughter , Niyah , was a huge video fan , and he was even more shocked by his daughter 's own confession . " She said that she wanted to be a video girl , " recalls Benjamin , who is based in Atlanta . " When I heard that , I put a proposal together to protest and contacted the managers of some of the rappers like Lil Jon , Kanye West and Li ' Kim . " It 's Cool to Be Smart ( www.itscooltobesmart.org ) focuses largely on mentoring Black girls from single-parent homes and exposing them to different levels of the music business , including production and songwriting . To take it a step further , the program has also contributed award scholarship money for some girls and , Benjamin hopes , the program gives a much-needed self-esteem boost for each of the young women who participate . " I think it 's the video image that the girls like , " he says . " The bling-bling . A lot of the girls want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show off to their peers . " In an complex era when negative images of women abound , for parents like Benjamin , Foster and Madison , the challenge of raising girls with healthy self-esteem has become more difficult . But whether your daughter tries to emulate a video vixen on television or is influenced by some other form of negativity , the tools and resources are available to help parents shape their daughters into proud , self-confident , self-respecting young ladies .

Both parents should give their daughter positive reinforcement , especially when she accomplishes a goal , such as improved grades or completion of a challenging task . 2 . Even if your child fails at something , encourage her to try again and not give up . 3 . Make sure that dads are actively involved with their daughter . If that is n't possible , work to provide a positive male image for your daughter , who could be a grandfather , uncle or a trusted member of your church . 4 . Expose girls to different role models , both male and female . // <p>
