<p> As Northern California 's crab season continues , once I 'm sated with eating whole crab in the most direct , messy and glorious way ( steamed whole ) , I turn to recipes that require greater artifice . That almost always means crab cakes . <p> For me , the best crab cakes means I sink my teeth into flavor and texture that is " crab transparent , " and transports me back to the crab of messiness - straight , unadulterated , essential crabmeat that does n't fill my mouth with breadcrumbs , mayonnaise , cream , eggs and vegetables . <p> I do n't care how creamy and how rich and how well-seasoned ; if I do n't get all crabmeat , I 'm disappointed . What I want should roll and slide on the tongue like silken crabmeat from which shell and bones have magically vanished . It should make me forget that there is any filler at all . <p> If you 're honest in your quest for the best-ever crab cakes , you first face the dark side - the competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another ocean . <p> That 's the Chesapeake Bay , Baltimore and the Atlantic Ocean , where the blue crab ( callinectes sapidus ) rules . The blue crab really should be Maryland 's state bird . <p> My colleague , Rob Kasper , sometime food columnist from the Baltimore Sun , confirms that on the Eastern shore , life ebbs and flows with crab . <p> Rob threw down the gauntlet . " Never heard of it , " he interrupts , as soon as I say the " D " word . Marylanders like Rob do n't acknowledge the existence of the Dungeness . Like most denizens of that state , Rob combatively claws at the mention of any other crab , especially the crab beloved to those from " the state that shall remain nameless . " <p> Crab culture in Baltimore creeps into every nook and cranny of fine Southern pride and Southern establishment so that " your family 's crab cake recipe is passed down like old silver from family member to family member , " he says . " Any variation of a hallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , animosity . " Rob says he 's attended many a dinner party where blindfolded guests taste and score crab cakes ( need any more proof of the obsession ? ) and count votes for the winner . <p> " It still did n't make a difference . Like the Florida elections , " he says . Votes do n't count ; people know their winning crab cakes for time eternal . <p> Kasper offered to send me a file of 1,000 crab cake recipes from the Sun 's archives . Seems that , as secretly as family cooks keep their crab cake recipes , everyone else is trying to guess what they are . <p> THE SECRETS <p> I coaxed , however , and Rob willingly divulged the fundamental secrets that are whispered at every table in Baltimore . <p>  --  " A real crab cake is held together by will power , " says Kasper . " If you need more than a strong will to hold it together , then you come from a certain other coast , which shall remain nameless . " <p>  --  Put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  And , " the widest known secret " : ( drumroll ) Old Bay seasoning . <p> By the end of our conversation , Kasper was conciliatory as well as magnanimous . " It 's a great crab , the D-crab ; just the second best crab on the face of the earth . " <p> I grew conciliatory , too . The best crab cakes I 've ever had , I owned , have indeed not been on the West Coast . High on my list are the crab cakes at Faidley 's , a stand in Lexington Market in Baltimore . Thick and plump , with huge lumps of crabmeat , the cake is a fistful of crab that nearly falls apart even as you lift it to your mouth . But , I added , " It 's the second best crab cake I 've ever had . " <p> Into his outraged silence , I dive in . The best crab cake I 've ever had comes from Chicago . <p> If I thought that by locating the best fairly and squarely in the unpolarized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was wrong . Kasper was stunned . <p> CHICAGO 'S CLAIM TO FAME <p> Shaw 's Crab House in Chicago , aiming to create the best ever crab cakes , ordered crabmeat from all over the country and experimented endlessly to achieve the best version , says Steve LaHaie , then general manager of the restaurant . The final recipe , on which Shaw 's rests its fame as a destination restaurant , is all blue crab , says LaHaie , now vice president of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises in Chicago . <p> Here 's the secret ( and they 're quite open about it ) : equal parts of the three types of fresh crabmeat  --  backfin , claw and jumbo lump meat . <p> The lump meat is the luscious single piece of muscle that works the swimming , short leg of the male blue crab . The female produces backfin meat , but the male produces the eye , the " filet mignon " of crabmeat . One hundred pounds of crabmeat produce 15 pounds of flesh ; 20 percent of that is lump meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 percent lump meat , but " the cost was prohibitive . " So they mixed in body and claw meat . <p> But  --  and here 's the real secret  --  they mixed in very little else . <p> Binding the crabmeat in the Shaw 's recipe is will power with a nudgling of binders . It meets Rob 's prime conditions . With just enough mayonnaise and a dusting of cracker meal to set the bond , the svelte , large cheeks of unbroken meat barely cling to each other . Breathe as you flip the cake , and it splats , but it 's oh so worth the risk . <p> The restaurant now orders its blue crabmeat where it comes in by the ton , from Louisiana  --  to the tune of 300 pounds a week . <p> " Do n't get me wrong , the Dungeness is a great crab to eat , " LaHaie says apologetically , but in his opinion blue crabmeat just seems to " have the most flavor ; it 's the most moist . " His supplier , Frank Randol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crabmeat to the warmer , less salty habitat . <p> Dungeness has no lump meat because our hallowed , cold-water crab does n't swim , according to Seattle-based food consultant Jon Rowley . While the blue crab swims ( working that lump muscle ) , the Dungeness , well , " sidles . " <p> Now to our job . What to do with our sidling critter that produces a lot of good meat , but tends to separate into a stringy mass as soon as it 's handled ? <p> The Chronicle 's Food department compared four recipes and found that if we played with the proportions of body to claw or leg meat , we got a lump-kind of texture . Picked crabmeat is available in three mixtures  --  all leg meat ; 60 percent body meat and 40 percent leg meat ; or 45 percent body , 45 percent broken leg meat and 10 percent leg meat . We found that a mix of straight leg meat with mixed meat created a whole-meat texture . <p> We also discovered this : When buying Dungeness crabmeat , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen . Ask for fresh , and if possible ask for meat that is picked from nonfrozen crab . ( Sometimes in processing , crab or crab sections are boiled and frozen before they are picked . And then the picked meat is frozen again . Avoid this , if possible . ) <p> GRAND COMPROMISE <p> We took a polyglot approach . We used crab claw meat from South America when our supplier did n't have just leg meat , but we mixed it with fresh-picked , never frozen Dungeness crabmeat . And finally , if you 're not a purist , try this variation : Slip some cut-up scallops ( cheaper than crabmeat , by the way ) into the mix for a jumbo lump substitute . <p> The recipe based on the one Shaw 's sent us , both with and without scallops , was the runaway success in our tasting . <p> Rob Kasper , the state that shall remain unamed calls you . We 're throwing down the oven mitt . <p> BEST-EVER CRAB CAKES , CHICAGO-SHAW 'S STYLE <p> Instead of the 1 1/2 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crabmeat , crab leg meat and scallops . <p> Ingredients : <p> 3/4 pound mixed crabmeat <p> 3/4 pound crab leg or claw meat <p> 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard <p> 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper <p> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne <p> 1/4 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning <p> 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce <p> 1 tablespoon chopped parsley <p> 1/2 cup mayonnaise <p> 1 large egg , beaten <p> 1 to 2 tablespoons cracker meal <p> Vegetable oil <p> Mustard Mayonnaise ( see recipe ) <p> INSTRUCTIONS : Preheat oven to 400 degrees .
