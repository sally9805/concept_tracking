alone , all aloney , on my owney saturday march 5th 11:00 a.m. as the crow flies Gray skies , gray cluds , gray knickers . I ca n't believe my knickers are gray , but it is typico of my life . My mutti put my white lacy knickers in the wash with Vati 's voluminous black shorts ( ! ) and now they are gray . If there was a medal for craposity in the mutti department , she would win it hands down . I am once again wandering lonely as a clud through this Vale of Tears . I wish there was someone I could duff up but I have no one to blame . Except God , and although He is everywhere at once He is also invisible . ( Also , the last person who tried to duff God up was Satan , and he ended up standing on his head in poo with hot swords up his bum-oley. ) 11:20 a.m . This is my fabulous life : the Sex God left for Whakatane last month and he has taken my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , otherwise there would be a big hole in my nunga-nungas. 11:28 a.m . And also I would be dead . Which quite frankly would be a blessing in disguise . 12:00 p.m . It is soooo boring being brokenhearted . My eyes look like little piggie eyes from crying . Which makes my nose look ginormous . Still , at least I am a lurker-free zone . Although with my luck there will be a lurker explosion any minute . Alison Bummer once had a double yolker on her neck ; she had a big spot and it had a baby spot growing on top of it . I 'll probably get that . 12:05 p.m . Phoned my very bestest pally , Jas . " Jas , it 's me . " " What ? " " Jas , you do n't sound very pleased to hear from me . " " Well . . . I would be , but it 's only five minutes since you last phoned and Tom is just telling me about this thing you can do . You go off into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with badgers , has it ? " " Well . . . no , not exactly , it 's a wilderness course and you learn how to make fire and so on . " Oh great balls of merde here we go , off into the land of the terminally insane , i.e. , Jasland . I said as patiently as I could because I am usually nice(ish) to the disadvantaged , " You are going off on a course to learn how to make fire ? " " Yes , exciting , eh ? " " Why do you have to go on a course to learn how to open a box of matches ? " " You ca n't use matches . " " Why not ? " " Because it 's a wilderness course . " " No , wrong , Jas , it 's a crap course where people are too mean to give you any matches . " She did that sighing business . " Look , Georgia , I know you are upset about Robbie going off to Kiwi-a-gogo land . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boyfriend or anything . " " Yes , well . . . " " And , you know , being all lonely , with no one to really care about you . " " Yes , alright Jas , I know all th  --  " " And the days stretching ahead of you without any meaning and  --  " " Jas , shut up . " " I 'm only trying to say that  --  " " That is not shutting up , Jas . It is going on and on . " She got all huffy and Jasish . " I must go now . Tom has got some knots to show me . " I was in the middle of saying , " Yes I bet he has . . . " in an ironic and trs amusant way when she brutally put the phone down . 12:30 p.m . Alone , all aloney . On my owney . The house is empty , too . Everyone is out at Grandad 's for lunch . I was nearly made to go until I pointed out that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbreak . Mine is a pathetico tale that would make anyone who had a heart weep , but that does not include Vati . He said he would gladly leave me behind because talking to me made him realize the fun he had had when he accidentally fell into the open sewers in India . 1:15 p.m . Looking out of my bedroom window . Entombed in my room forever . Like in that book The Prisoner of Brenda or whatever it is called . Except I could go out if I wanted . But I do n't want to . I may never go out again . Ever . 1:30 p.m . This is boring . I 've been cooped up for about a million years . What time is it ? Phoned Jas . " Jas ? " " Oh God . " " What time is it ? " " What ? " " Why are you saying what ' for ? I merely asked you a civil question . " " Why do n't you look at your own clock ? " " Jas , have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is over ? Have you noticed that ? " " Yes I have , because you have been on the phone telling me every five minutes for a month . " " Well , I am soo sorry if it is too much trouble to tell your very bestest pal the time . Perhaps my eyes are too swollen from tears to see the clock . " " Well , are they ? " " Yes . " " Well , how come you could see to dial my number ? " Mrs. Huffy Knickers was so unreasonable . " Anyway , I 'm not your bestest pal anymore . Nauseating P. Green is your bestest pal now that you rescued her from the clutches of the Bummer twins . " I slammed down the phone . Brilliant . Sex Godless and now friend to P. Green , that well-known human goldfish . Sacr bloody bleu and triple merde . And poo . Oh Robbie , how could you leave me and go off to the other ( incredibly crap ) side of the world ? What has Kiwi-a-gogo land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think I 'll play the tape he gave me again . It 's all I have left to remind me of him and our love . That will never die . Continues ...
