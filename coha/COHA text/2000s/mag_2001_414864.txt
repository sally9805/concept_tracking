CLYDE PEELING 'S LOVE OF SNAKESBIG SNAKES , LITTLE SNAKES , LOTS OF SNAKESGOES BACK TO CATCHING A HOGNOSED SNAKE AT SCOUT CAMP . Photograph // Cruising above New Jersey in the small plane he was piloting , Clyde Peeling 's heart began to pound when he caught a glimpse of movement in the passenger seat . His traveling companion that day : Slurpy , a reticulated python named for its appetite for rabbits . Reticulated pythons are the longest snakes in the world-up to 30 feet-although Slurpy was a mere 14 feet . Mr. Peeling saw the lid to Slurpy 's box slowly rise . Then he saw Slurpy . Controlling the plane with his left hand , Mr. Peeling reached with his right and pushed Slurpy back into the box . Minutes later , out came Slurpy 's slithery brown head again . Soon , Slurpy was so far out of the box that the snake 's head and neck were getting intertwined in the plane 's controls . As he tried to get Slurpy back in the box , the plane bounced wildly . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he made an emergency landing at the nearest airport and wrapped Slurpy 's box so tight with duct tape " that even a dinosaur could n't have escaped . " " It could have ended in a very bad way , " Mr. Peeling says . Welcome to Clyde Peeling 's wonderful world of snakes . Anyone for a Bearded Dragon ? Mr. Peeling , a nationally recognized reptile expert , is founder of Reptiland , a specialized zoo in Allenwood , Pa . Mr. Peeling 's pets include hundreds of rare and exotic species of reptiles and amphibians including alligators , bearded dragons , vipers , rattlesnakes , cobras , anacondas , geckos , gila monsters , mambas , frogs , turtles and giant tortoises . Most days , Mr. Peeling can be found at his zoo , where visitors can learn about the importance and beauty of the reptiles . Visitors can even touch a live alligator or boa constrictor . When he 's not there , he 's on the road with his critters . He speaks at schools and colleges and is a frequent guest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Peeling has been intrigued by snakes since the summer day he caught his first hognosed snake at Boy Scout camp . " The neighbors thought I was weird , " Mr. Peeling says , " but the more I found out about snakes , the more I wanted to know . " He recalls the time he and his friends spent hours sloshing through a swamp trying to catch what they believed was a monster water snake . " We were so proud when we succeeded in scooping the snake into a large garbage can , " Mr. Peeling says . He now knows the snake was a northern banded water snake , a nonvenomous species . " It may as well have been a 16foot anaconda as far as we were concerned , " he says . In high school , his teachers and guidance counselor told him he could n't make a living running a reptile zoo . Mr. Peeling was determined to prove them wrong . Photograph Clyde Peeling and friend : Has anyone seen a boa around here ? " Photograph Slimy ? Who 're you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learn as You Go In 1964 , after serving in the Air Force-during which he once ending up in a hospital for two weeks after being bitten three times by an angry rattlesnake-Mr . Peeling borrowed money from his grandfather , bought land and opened Reptiland . " I had 25 to 30 species . An alligator , an anaconda , a boa constrictor , a few turtles , a cobra , " he says . In those days , not much was known about exotic reptiles . But over the years , as his collection of reptiles grew , so did his knowledge of them and their habitats . Today , he keeps and breeds species of snakes that 20 years ago would n't have survived in captivity . " It 's all about understanding their natural habitat , " Mr. Peeling says . " You have to know exactly how they live in the wild-what is their habitat , what do they eat , what temperatures make them comfortable , do they like it dry or moist ? " And how good are they at escaping ? SNAKE FACTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Of them , 400 are venomous ; about 50 pose a danger to humans . The smallest snake , the Texas blind snake , is only four inches long . The king cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world . sometimes exceeding 18 feet in length . In the wild , king cobras eat other snakes , so in captivity , zookeepers often trick them into eating rodents by scenting the rodent with snake musk . Although it carries a deadly dose of venom , the Asian Cobra is actually a " bluffer " - it often raises its hood , hisses and strikes with its mouth closed . Snakes live everywhere in the world , except in the Arctic , Antarctica , Iceland , Ireland , New Zealand and a few small islands . A snake can stretch its jaws more than most animals . This enables it to swallow prey that is three or four times the size of its head . MY FAVORITE SNAKES . CLYDE PEELING KNOWS SNAKES . And he knows what he likes about snakes : With its bright red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most colorful . A native of Mexico , this species is a " mimic . " It is n't poisonous , but its pattern and colors look like that of several venomous snakes . Because predators like birds ca n't tell the difference between the milk snake and the look-alike venomous snakes , they tend to leave it alone . The Diamondback Rattlesnake vibrates its tail whre it feels threatened , makin a loud rattling noise . The largest of the rattlesnakes , it is found in the southern United States , Each time a rattlesnake sheds its skin ( three to five times a year ) it leaves a dry scacle attached to the preceding rattle segment . After a few sheddings , this loosely con nected series of dry dead skin becomes the noisemaker . The Sidewinder Rattlesnake is sometimes called a horned rattlesnake because of the horn-like scales over each eye . Found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico , the snake moves sideways quickly over the desert sand while holding itself in an " S " shape . The of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costa Rica . With spine-like scales above the eyes , the snakes appears to have eyelashes . Some the babys in a litter are green , others are brown and some bright yellow . This is a " polmorphic " species , meaning there are different colors within one species . The viper kills by gripping a branch with its tail and striking out . Often , the snakes eats while suspended in the air . When confonted by an enemy , the Red Spitting Cobra rears its head , spreads its hood and squeezes its venom sacs . The venom is forced through tubes under each eye , down through the hollow fangs , and squirts forward in fine streams . The snake aims for the predator 's eyes  --  the venom cause temporary or permanent blindness . As its name indicates , this cobra is brick red and blends with the reddish dusty soil of its habitat in northern Kenya and Ethiopia . It 's know for raiding chicken houses , where it feeds on eggs and young chicks . The Gaboon Viper is the largest viper and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its prey , it opens its mouth wide and the fangs- as much as two inches long  --  unfold from the roof of the mouth , sinking deep into animal 's body . These are known as " retractable " fangs . Its pastel colors and intricate designs camouflage the viper on the floor of the rain forest and woodlands where it lives throughout Africa . The viper 's bite is often fatal to humans . The deadly Saw-Scaled Viper frightens its enemies by rubbing several rows of scales together , creating a loud , rasping sound . Found mostly in the deserts and mountains of southeast Asia and northern Africa , the saw-scaled viper is known to cause more snakebites worldwide than any other species . The venom of the Asian Cobra is deadly , but Photograph PUEBLAN MILK SNAKE Photograph DIAMONDBACK RATTLESNAKE Photograph SIDEWINDER RATTLESNAKE Photograph EYELASH VIPER // because it has short , immovable fangs in the front of the upper jaw , it has to pursue , grab , hold onto and chew its prey to be sure its fangs have penetrated deep enough to inject venom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its prey biting back and also is less protected than other snakes from the large animals that prey on it . When the cobra is frightened , it rears the front of its body into the air and creates a " hood . " The Green Tree Python and the Emerald Tree Boa are beautiful snakes that look almost identical . The boa lives in the rain forests of South America ; while the python can be found in Indonesia or Australia . Their leafy-green color camouflages them among the trees where they live . These two snakes have adapted to live in similar environments on opposite sides of the world .
