As the universe sings , Alex Szalay listens for answers to fundamental cosmological questions . // During the fall of 2003 , Alexander Szalay was busy " cutting " two CDs - one containing Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) data another featuring his rock band . Such is the life of this full-time astronomer and occasional rock star who grew up in Hungary . As a chaired professor of astronomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , the database " guru " for the SDSS , and project director for the National Virtual Observatory , Szalay has more than enough to stay busy . " I love every minute of what I 'm doing , " he says , " but I wish I had another 24 hours in a day to do music . " Prelude These days , astronomy comes first for Szalay . But back in the 1970s , while still in Hungary , he led a dual life : cosmology by day , rock " n ' roll by night . In 1974 , he and four others , including his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panta Rhei . The band 's name comes from the sixth-century B.C. Greek philosopher Heraclitus ' saying , " It 's impossible to step into the same river twice , " meaning " everything changes . " In 1982 , the band broke up , but it still gets together occasionally to record . Panta Rhei was successful in Hungary , selling more than 100,000 albums and touring throughout Eastern Europe regularly . Szalay , 56 , grew up in Hungary . Both of his parents were nuclear physicists , as was his grandfather , and he lived with his parents on the site of a small nuclear physics institute in Debrecen , Hungary . After earning a bachelor 's degree in physics in 1969 from Kossuth University - now the University of Debrecen - he received a master 's degree in theoretical physics and a doctorate in astrophysics from Eotvos University in Budapest , in 1972 and 1975 , respectively . During the following 5 years , Szalay continued to juggle physics and music - a lifestyle that afforded him little sleep . By 1980 , he had to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as it could playing in university clubs in Hungary and neighboring countries . " To do more in music , I would have had to give up physics , " Szalay says . Meanwhile , he was under pressure from his parents to drop music . His father , in particular , considered rock " n ' roll a complete waste of time . Szalay chose physics and looked for a postdoctoral position in the United States or Western Europe . Unfortunately , he did not have any luck finding one . " I decided to give it 1 more year " he says . " If I did n't get a good job offer , I 'd stay in music . " Cosmological connection Szalay s employment difficulties may have stemmed from his research specialty - the cosmological implications of massive neutrinos - which he pursued under the supervision of the famous Soviet physicist Yakov Zel'dovich . Given cosmology 's speculative nature at the time , this line of work was considered dubious , keeping Szalay on the fringes of astrophysics . His fortunes changed dramatically in 1980 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coveted speaker at scientific gatherings . He impressed Joseph Silk , a University of California at Berkeley cosmologist , at a Warsaw conference where Szalay gave a series of talks . Silk offered Szalay a job , as did University of Chicago astrophysicist David Schramm . Szalay accepted both offers , shuttling among Berkeley , Chicago , and Hungary during the next several years until he joined the Hopkins faculty in 1987 - where he was finally able to settle down with his wife and son . Photograph MULTI-TALENTED ALEX SZALAY regards the universe as the ultimate musical instrument . Photograph FOR THE SDSS TEAM to understand the extreme amount of data the survey is collecting , Alex Szalay had to refine data processing . // Soon thereafter , as a result of his career decision , instead of playing music in front of screaming fans , he was playing an audio representation of galaxy distributions to scholars at a Tokyo conference . Those are the compromises a rock star makes upon entering the ivory tower of academia . Yet Szalay has somehow managed to keep active on the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 . Few fellow astronomers know about Szalay s musical efforts . And that 's just as well , he says . " I do n't want to be known as the astronomer who does music or as the musician who does astronomy . If you play music , it has to be good enough to stand on its own . The same holds for astronomy . Achieving something in one area does n't give you a break in another area . " Resonant ties Despite their apparent differences , Szalay does n't regard astronomy and music as separate . " Both scientists and musicians take new ideas on the road . They go on tour and perform . " Writing a scientific paper , says Szalay , " is a creative process , comparable to writing a song . Although you have certain elements in mind to start with , you ca n't predict the outcome . " Collaborating with a fellow astronomer is like " jamming " with your band , he adds . When Szalay works with University of Toronto astrophysicist Dick Bond , " there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word and the other knows exactly where he 's going . The same thing happens in music : You play a note and your partner takes off on it . " Szalay is by no means the first person to perceive connections between the two disciplines . Pythagoras , the sixth-century B.C. Greek philosopher and mathematician , suggested the existence of the " music of the spheres " - a harmonious humming , imperceptible on Earth , that is produced by the orderly movements of celestial bodies . Johannes Kepler , along with many other astronomers , embraced the Pythagoras concept , but Szalay wants no part of it . Szalay would rather not be associated with the ancient Greek view of the heavens . Yet oddly enough , the main cosmological problem he 's pursued for the past couple decades is a musical one : trying to figure out the universe 's resonant frequency . Music of the cosmos A musical instrument such as a guitar or drum has a characteristic , or " resonant , " frequency at which it naturally vibrates . This frequency 's exact value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . Parts of the instrument - whether guitar strings or drum head - vibrate at particular frequencies , creating harmonics roughly at octave intervals . What you hear is the sum of the fundamental frequency - the note the musician plays - and the higher harmonics . The overall sound reflects the relative strengths of these components . Shortly after the Big Bang , says Szalay , the universe was like a musical instrument - a big noisy expanse filled with hot , dense ionized " fluid , " or plasma , of matter and photons . Gravity compressed the plasma , but being under high pressure , the plasma bounced back , producing sound waves of different frequencies that reverberated through the cosmos . These sound waves in the plasma were composed of expansion and compression regions which are characterized by subtle variations in mass density . Because the waves come only in distinct sizes ( or wavelengths ) , there is a pattern in the dumpiness they create ( see " The cosmic Slinky toy " on page 50 for a more in-depth explanation ) . Some 380,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the liberated photons preserved a record of the mass density fluctuations from that early time , which is now seen as the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) . By determining the musical signals produced by this cosmic " instrument " - its resonant frequency and overtones - astronomers can learn about the early universe 's size , shape , and structure , as well as the physics of the plasma . They also can determine the relative amounts of ordinary ( baryonic ) matter to dark matter , because the primordial sound waves affect only ordinary matter . Most work in cosmology involves moving backward - getting close to the moment when everything began . Today , investigators can detect temperature differences in the CMB as small as a millionth of a degree and measure the dumpiness of galaxies with growing precision . From that evidence , they can elicit the " music " responsible for the pattern and , going further back in time , characterize the instrument that made the sounds . " It 's like hearing a symphony and trying to figure out which instruments played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " in cosmology , the orchestra is much " simpler , " with fewer instruments and fewer notes , but the piece takes a long time to play . " Understanding harmonics To understand the cosmic symphony , astronomers face the mammoth task of making sense of reams of data . A statistical tool now widely used for evaluating cosmological data is a spin-off of the Szalay brothers ' work in electronic music . In the 1970s , they began building electronic equipment for their band . In so doing , Alex says , " I learned an enormous amount about signal processing , discovering new techniques for collecting and analyzing data I later brought into cosmology . " Andras has designed some of the most sophisticated digital pianos and synthesizers . Working on one invention in the early 1990s , Andras needed to reproduce electronically the entire range of sounds a piano can make at a time when digitally storing this much information ( roughly a gigabyte , in all ) was prohibitively expensive . He discovered a statistical approach from decades prior called the Karhunen-Love ( K-L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , Andras could reduce all piano sounds to eight fundamental components , each with different amplitude settings . Data compression would decrease the information total from a gigabyte to a megabyte . He asked Alex what he thought . Alex was fascinated with the KarhunenLove algorithm and made suggestions Andras eventually incorporated in the first ( and possibly only ) musical synthesis device to use K-L . Months later , while discussing cosmology with Joseph Silk , Szalay realized K-L was what they needed to analyze the CMB and large-scale distribution of galaxies . " In electronic music , the point is to synthesize a desired waveform , " he explains . " In cosmology , it 's the other way around : You take the output waveform and try to determine the physical processes responsible for it . The same tools work , even though the direction is opposite . " Karhunen-Love is related to a statistical technique called Fourier analysis , which can break down a sound - or any curve on a graph - into a combination of sine waves of specific amplitude , frequency , phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works best in a symmetrical volume like a cube , whereas K-L can identify fundamental modes in irregular volumes such as the " cells " used in the SDSS . Statistical serenade In the mid-1990s , Szalay teamed up with his then-postdoc Michael Vogeley - now on the Drexel University faculty - to bring the idea to their colleagues . " It 's the best possible approximation of Fourier analysis you can do with our data " Vogeley explains . For this reason , K-L is crucial to the SDSS analysis . That 's a prominent role , given that SDSS is the largest galaxy survey ever undertaken ( see " Sloan Digital Sky Survey " on page 49 ) . After it 's complete , SDSS will have measured the distance to more than 1 million galaxies and determined the positions and brightness of more than 100 million celestial objects . The process will generate over 40 terabytes ( 40 million megabytes ) of information . Photograph ALEX SZALAY awaits his next project : the National Virtual Observatory . INSET : Alex Szalay rocks on the guitar while playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SDSS researchers will determine the " power spectrum , " to reveal deviations in galactic density in differentsize volumes and regions of space . Aided by K-L , they will convert their raw data into a set of fundamental modes - or waves - having set frequencies and amplitudes . The power spectrum shows how amplitude varies with frequency , telling astronomers the physical scale or wavelength at which the biggest fluctuations occur . Szalay is interested in large-scale fluctuations only , on the order of 195 to 650 million light-years , because they contain information about the early universe , whereas small-scale fluctuations reflect individual galaxies . K-L acts as a filter , so investigators can select the cosmological scales and ignore the rest . " It 's like a pointillist painting , " Vogeley says . " If you view it on a small scale , you 'll just see individual dots and miss the big picture . But in cosmology , all we care about is the big picture . " In preparing for SDSS , Vogeley and Szalay knew they had to match the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been doing space-age astronomy with stone-age statistics , " says Vogeley . In addition to SDSS , the K-L technique also is used in CMB experiments . The main benefit is data compression , says Massachusetts Institute of Technology cosmologist Max Tegmark : " It enables you to throw away the noise and keep everything you want . " Tegmark credits Szalay and Vogeley with introducing the K-L tool to cosmology . But Szalay 's contributions extend far beyond K-L modes , says Tegmark . " He has spearheaded the use of advanced statistics throughout astronomy and is interested in bringing to bear anything that will advance the field . " According to Dick Bond , a CMB expert , " Alex has been an unbelievably powerful force at SDSS , and after the full survey comes out , people will see what he 's done . Data archiving is not some minor problem . It is the problem in astronomy today , and Alex is leading the way . " " The word " interdisciplinary " is used a lot these days , " says Vogeley , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to recognize that the problems he had grappled with in music , signal processing , and cosmology were , in essence , the same problem . " More than a melody Szalay s work as principal investigator for the National Virtual Observatory ( NVO ) is another example of his contributions to astronomy . The project 's goal - to create a worldwide " telescope " to allow ready access to data in multiple wavelengths and from multiple instruments - is nothing short of transforming astronomy as we know it . The challenge is to manage all the data now pouring in from surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum , while facilitating multi-spectral comparisons . If the NVO works as planned , says Szalay , " scientists will be free to concentrate on science , taking on projects that were not conceivable before , without getting mired in menial tasks , " such as data organization . An undertaking this big , combined with his efforts on the gargantuan SDSS , makes for a huge time commitment . After long days working on the forefront of astronomy , Szalay no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs , though he often retires to his studio at home to play guitar and compose . He does n't regret his career choice , yet occasionally ca n't help thinking about " the road not taken . " Recently , Szalay heard Brian May , lead guitarist for the rock group Queen , speaking on the radio about interstellar dust . Although this might seem incongruous , in the 1970s , while Szalay pursued his graduate work , May was a Ph.D . candidate in astrophysics at Imperial College in London , similarly torn between his studies and the lure of rock " n ' roll . May left graduate school when his band hit the big time . He claims he was n't disciplined enough to be a scholar , calling himself a better musician than astronomer . The world , May says , got the better choice . " There 's a guy who went the other way , " Szalay notes . According to his colleagues , the world got " the better choice " when Szalay opted for academia over music . Thanks to his decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stronger today . But Szalay has not entirely put music on the sidelines : He spends every day trying to master the ultimate instrument - the universe itself .
