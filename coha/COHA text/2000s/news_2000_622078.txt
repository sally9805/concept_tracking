<p> Just off the square in downtown Sonoma is one of the prettiest spots in town , Siena Red Brewery and Bistro . <p> Unfortunately , neither the food nor the service at this restaurant match either the gorgeous setting or the brewmaster John Gilooly 's well crafted house-brewed lagers and ales . ( If you do n't feel like drinking beer , there are about two dozen wines , all available by the glass . ) <p> The decor , perhaps best described as Victorian-industrial , is wonderful . Deep red walls , turquoise shutters , fringed light and window shades , cozy sofas and deep , comfy chairs soften the steel beams and towering brew tanks visible through a large window behind the bar . In the back , there 's a spacious patio with a lovely garden and pond , a remnant of the feed store that once occupied the building . <p> On Friday and Saturday nights , Siena Red offers live blues , including such greats as John Lee Hooker Jr. , who appeared a few weeks ago . On Sundays , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its best with baby back ribs ( $11.25 ) . They were not the finest ribs I 've had and barbecue aficionados will likely be unimpressed , but the meat was tender , the sauce sweet and mildly spicy . Mashed potatoes seasoned with bacon and green onions were dense and perfectly seasoned , and corn on the cob was both smokey and sweet . <p> A BLT ( $8.25 ) on the lunch menu was straightforward , with good bacon , crisp lettuce and plenty of mayonnaise . In spite of mediocre tomatoes and under-toasted bread that arrived cold , it was still pretty good , though the house-made chips served alongside tasted stale . <p> Other dishes did n't measure up . Shrimp cakes ( $9.25 ) were virtually tasteless  --  and soggy , too . Spring rolls with julienned vegetables and ahi tuna ( $9.50 ) could have been good but the tuna tasted slightly off and the vegetables were unseasoned . The fresh , crisp Asian slaw garnished with sweet hoisin glaze that comes with the spring rolls , however , was refreshing . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressingly reminiscent of canned nacho sauce and served with thin , brightly colored chips , was classic pub fare : Too salty by half , it 'll keep you reaching for your beer . <p> A smoked chicken quesadilla ( $7.50 ) was dismal . Strips of unpeeled bell peppers made it difficult to cut , but there was too much going on to pick it up . The smoked chicken was dry , and the salsa , served alongside in a ramekin , tasted bottled . The best part was a garnish of perfectly ripe avocado slices ; there also was an inexplicable mound of chopped lettuce , unseasoned and undressed . <p> A grilled portobello sandwich ( $8.50 , lunch only ) had similar problems , with those under-cooked peppers making it difficult to eat because they kept sliding out and falling on the plate . There were so many other ingredients that it was hard to find the portobello , and the bitter taste of burned garlic infused several bites . <p> Mac and cheese ( $7.95 ) , the only dinner option for vegetarians , was beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted a lot like that cheese fondue ; it was macaroni in cheese sauce rather the custardy delight of real macaroni and cheese . <p> Sometimes less really is more , a maxim that management of Siena Red might want to consider . Many servings were out of proportion , with seemingly little relationship to what people might actually be able to eat , or even share . Ingredients , too , showed a similar misguided exuberance . <p> Grilled salmon ( $13.95 ) was dwarfed by enough neon-green basil mashed potatoes to serve three or four people . The potatoes sat in a deep pool of burnt orange Tabasco beurre blanc and a half-dozen spears of tough , bitter , pencil-thin asparagus surrounded the sauce . The potatoes , both bland and cloying , fought with the powerful Tabasco , while the forlorn salmon , overcooked and dry ( we 'd requested it rare ) , was helpless in the face of it all . It is impossible to even guess where the chef was trying to go with this dish . <p> Likewise with coriander-crusted blackened tuna ( $13.75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relish . What is the kitchen thinking ? <p> Caesar salad ( $6.75 ) could have done without the chipotle promised on the menu . The salad was good , and the smoked peppers nowhere in evidence . <p> " Do you think there was a sale on cabbage ? , " my lunch companion asked when he saw the mountain of Asian slaw that came with fried calamari ( $8.50 ) . There must have been a quart and a half of it , with big pieces of calamari scattered around the edge of the plate and drizzled with a few squirts of roasted chile aioli . The first bite of the calamari was good , with tender tentacles cloaked in a dark , crispy batter , but as soon as it began to cool the taste of cooking oil took over . My advice : eat these nuggets quickly , or pass them by . The slaw itself was nowhere near as good as it had been on an earlier visit . <p> Winter salad ( $8.50 ) , a huge portion of spinach and frisee , was marred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to wonder why a winter salad is still on the menu in June . <p> Service here was inexperienced and tentative . On one visit , we were left alone on the patio for nearly 40 minutes , until we reminded the waiter we were there . Another waiter brought our appetizers and main courses at the same time , and gave no indication that the kitchen 's timing might be off . To get the check , and then again to pay it , we had to interrupt our young server as he munched a burger and chatted with a co-worker . Another waiter told us to find him when we wanted our main courses . Say what ? Do we really have to work for our dinner ? <p> Siena Red is currently owned by Terra Nova Industries , a restaurant construction company that took over when a previous owner defaulted on a loan . In December , chef Albert Chitwood assumed management responsibilities . His wife , Julia Larini , manages the front of the house . They closed for three weeks , revamped the menu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrade service , too . Clearly , they have a long way to go . <p> The staff ca n't be blamed for their inexperience ; they appear to have never waited tables before and desperately need a few lessons . And Chitwood needs better control of his kitchen . Combining diverse cuisines  --  Mexican , Italian , Asian , Southern , and French are all represented on the menu ( with numerous misspellings of traditional dishes and ingredients )  --  is tricky , and when it does n't work it can be disastrous . <p> I hope they succeed . Siena Red is such an appealing spot that it would be a shame for the space to go to waste . <p> CHART : <p> SIENA RED ADDRESS : 529 First St. W.
