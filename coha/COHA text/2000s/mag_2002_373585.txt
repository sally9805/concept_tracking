SHE COULD N'T EVEN WIN THE LAWSUIT COMPETITION <P> A civil war in the South has been averted , and a Miss America pageant once divided is now strong . After weeks in which two women claimed to be Miss North Carolina , MISTY CLYMER , right , has been named the sole bearer of the title . Clymer had been battling REBEKAH REVELS , who won the state contest but resigned  --  she says under pressure  --  when her ex-boyfriend alleged he had topless pictures of her . After the sash passed to first runner-up Clymer , Revels sued to get the title back . Before a decision was made , both women went to Atlantic City , N.J. , for prepageant activities , which apparently included many opportunities for frolicking on the beach . A federal judge ruled that the Miss America organization did not have to recognize Revels ' claim to the tiara , and added he hoped his decision would preserve the reputation of the pageant , which he called " a significant part of Americana .

Worldwide protests against his captivity led his handlers to release him off the coast of Iceland in July . Now , however , he has turned up in Norway , seeking adoration and herring from Homo sapiens , around whom he seems most comfortable . Some Norwegian salmon fishers complained that Keiko was scaring off their catch , and one scientist suggested he be killed for his own good . Norwegian officials offered last week to give Keiko his own fjord , where he can help lure tourists and retire in peace  --  thereby avoiding the self-destructive path often taken by child stars . <P> ZERO GRAVITY HAS N'T HURT HIS AIM <P> Bart Sibrel is a familiar breed around Los Angeles : a filmmaker bitter that his work remains overlooked by the public . He spent years on his self-produced documentary A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon , in which he contends that nasa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert . He sought recognition last week from BUZZ ALDRIN , who flew on the Apollo 11 mission . Aldrin arrived at a Beverly Hills , Calif. , hotel expecting to be interviewed for Japanese TV . Instead , he encountered Sibrel brandishing a Bible and demanding that Aldrin swear he had walked on the moon . Aldrin , 72 , punched Sibrel in the face . The astronaut says he was defending himself , but Sibrel has vowed to press charges . All of this probably wo n't help Sibrel get an agent . <P> Back to the Headlocks
