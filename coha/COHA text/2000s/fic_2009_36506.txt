On a Thursday night in late December , I stood in my friend Indrani Dressler 's living room , flirting with a man I had just met . <br> " Oh , come on , " Mick , the Englishman I was talking to , was saying , " business acumen and a finger on the zeitgeist are not the same as innovation or originality . She 's a clever parasite . " <br> " I heard one of her songs the other day in a deli , " I said . " It brought back that feeling of being young and wild and idiotic . You just ca n't take her too seriously . " <br> " She 's got a fake accent , " Mick said , his mouth gleaming with mirth and wine , firm and half-sneering . His breath smelled like corn . " She irons her hair and she 's had too much plastic surgery and she 's pasty . She looks like an emaciated Wife of Bath . " <br> " She 's got the body of a thirteen-year-old gymnast and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's a maggot , " he said . He was not much taller than I , but broad in the shoulders and solid . His head was large , his face half ugly , half handsome , more French-looking than English , nose too big , eyes narrow , chin jutting forward . We were talking as if the words themselves did n't matter . I had forgotten this feeling . <br> " A maggot , " I repeated , laughing , egging him on . <br> " Tunneling her way through personas till they 're totally rotten and riddled with holes , then moving on to the next one . She went from soft white larva to shriveled maggot in twenty-odd years . " <br> " Obviously , " I said with mild triumph , " you 're obsessed with her . " <br> " I 'm writing an opera about her , " he told me in a way that made it impossible to tell whether he was kidding or serious . " Back before she made it . Back when she was young and soft and nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was a newborn vampire , a baby whore . " <br> I realized with a shock of surprise who he was . About a year ago , one of my clients , a pale , severely chic young concert violinist named Alison Fisher , had precipitously quit therapy after five years and moved to Canada to take care of her dying aunt . She had spent many sessions complaining eloquently and , I 'd thought , with very good reason , about her boyfriend , Mick Logan ; he was British , he wrote avant-garde operas that told melodramatic fictional stories about famous people , and he made Alison feel clumsy and plain and dull with his devastatingly sharp but subtle put-downs . With much guidance and feedback on my part , she had finally managed to get rid of him . According to what Alison had told me , he was in his mid-thirties , about ten years younger than I was ; he was very bad news . She 'd said once that breaking up with Mick felt like being let out of jail . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , leading me into a sexually charged , ultimately nonsensical argument that seemed to be rapidly leading somewhere I knew I could n't go , somewhere I had n't even thought of going in a very , very long time . <br> Just then , I caught sight of a reflection of a woman in the tilted gilt-edged mirror across the room . She was dressed similarly to me , so I tilted my head to get a better look at her . As I did so , the woman tilted her head to match the movement of mine . I raised my wineglass ; she raised hers along with me . <br> It was then , in that instant , that I knew that my marriage was over . <br> My heart stopped beating . I almost heard it squeak as it constricted with fear , and then it resumed its steady rhythm and life went on , as it usually does . <br> " She 's not a villainess , though ; she 's not interesting enough , " Mick was saying . " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just quite vile really . " <br> " Vile , " I repeated , laughing , mouth open , neck bared , my rib cage pulsing with my hard-beating heart . My laughter had a freaky sound in it , like the yelp of a wild dog . I had to move out , I thought with horror . Or Anthony did . No , I did . Our apartment was his when I married him . And I had to take Wendy with me . Where , though ? Where would we go ? She 'd hate me even more than she did already . Of course , she 'd blame me , because it was all going to be my fault . " Then why would you write an opera about her ? " <br> " Because , " he said , " like a maggot , she 's got under my skin and it 's the only way to get her out . That revoltingly nasal little voice . Those dead-fish eyes . Those ropy muscles . . . " <br> I felt the vastly gigantic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawyers , custody , settlement , alimony . I 'd always been someone who made decisions with agonizing thoroughness and caution ; to have such a momentous realization thrust upon me with no control whatsoever felt the way being in an earthquake or avalanche might have felt . <br> Anthony had stayed home that night , ostensibly because he had a lot of research to do for his new book , but in truth , he was relieved not to have to go out . He hated parties in general and did n't much like Indrani ; he thought she was boring , which she was n't , but you could n't argue with him when he got an idea about someone . Right then , he was probably sitting in his armchair , happily engrossed in some book about post-Communist Eastern Europe , his current preoccupation , sipping at a water glass filled with neat whiskey , reading glasses on the end of his nose , frowning , gently scratching and rubbing his sternum under his shirt in that abstracted way he had . Anthony was a political scientist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been a dynamic , passionate man , but over the past years , as he got closer to death and the world continued to go down the tubes , his old fired-up passion had been gradually replaced by bitterness , fatalism , and weariness . I had watched it happen , powerless to stop it . <br> This attitude of defeated resignation now extended from his work to everything in his life , including our marriage . He was becoming , somehow , an old man . I was apparently still a youngish woman ; I looked at my reflection again to make sure I had n't been mistaken about this , and there I still was , radiant , my hair upswept , my eyes wide and sparkling . If that reflection had belonged to a stranger , I would have been intimidated by her . I had had no idea . <br> " You wrote an opera about Nico , " I said giddily to Mick , just to say something ; I had just realized that he seemed to be awaiting a reply from me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " <br> " Oh , " I said , realizing what I 'd just revealed . " God . Well . " <br> He looked at me , waiting . <br> " I just realized who you are , " I said . I had never before made a slip like this in eighteen years of being a therapist . " I know a friend of yours . " <br> " Which friend ? " <br> " Alison . " <br> " Alison , " he said , as if he were hoping it were n't that Alison . <br> " Alison Fisher . " <br> He shook his head . " How the hell do you know her ? " <br> " Oh , " I said , waving a casual hand sideways . " You know , New York . " <br> " Right , " he said . <br> " I have n't seen her in ages , " I added by way of reassurance . <br> " She dumped me cold . Never happened to me before or since . Little witch . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-full glass from me , grazing his knuckles against mine so all the little hairs on his crackled electrically against all the little hairs on mine . He drank from my glass , his eyes audaciously on mine over the rim . " Enough about Alison . What do you do , Josephine ? Does n't everyone here ask that question before the topic turns to real estate ? " <br> " Oh , I 'm a painter , " I lied . I had always wanted to be a painter , and I could n't tell the truth after that slip about Alison ; he might have put together that I was the very therapist involved in that little witch 's cold dumping of him and surmised that I therefore knew certain things about him , certain highly unflattering things . And that would have been awkward , and the last thing I wanted in this conversation was awkwardness . What I did want , I was n't yet sure . <br> Mick handed my glass back to me . My body curved to match the curve of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " What sort of painting ? " <br> " Abstract , " I said . <br> " Abstract , " he said . <br> " Abstract , " I replied . Repeating each other 's words was like sex , I was remembering . My reflection , I noticed , was leaning alluringly into him . I had n't realized how willowy I was , how darkly elegant . I had to leave Anthony : I owed it to this woman in the mirror . <br> " Painting is sexy , " said Mick . " Writing operas , on the other hand , is lonely and pointless . Who gives a fuck ? Aria , schmaria . " <br> " Painting is sexy , " I repeated . " You stand in your studio half-naked , smearing paint all over the canvas until you explode from the sheer pleasure of it . " <br> He laughed ; there was a glint , a predatory edge , in his laughter , and I noticed that he was standing a little closer to me now . " Alison Fisher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were now inextricably associated with her , but he was willing to overlook it . I had a sudden urge to suck his cock . <br> " I need some more wine , " I said . " You rudely guzzled my last glass . " <br> " Wait here , " he said , and plucked the glass from my hand . I watched him walk over to the dining room table , where all the bottles were . He was wearing a black turtleneck sweater and well-fitting brown jeans and black Doc Martens . He had a good ass . I glanced over at the mirror and again beheld my reflection . My new best friend , I thought with tipsy seasonal sentimentality . <br> " Josie , " said Indrani , standing at my elbow . Her cheeks were flushed . Her blond hair shone . She wore red velvet . I had known her since college , and to me , she still looked exactly the same as the day I 'd met her . She smelled of expensive , slightly astringent perfume . " Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , kissing her . " He 's swamped with work . He 's so sorry to miss it . You look so beautiful ! " <br> She looked at me . " You do , too , " she said . " I mean it . " <br> " Thanks , " I said . " I 've been talking to your friend Mick . He 's a big flirt , is n't he ? " <br> " Is he ? I hardly know him ; he 's a friend of Ravi 's . " This was her much younger brother . Her parents had had a penchant for exotic names ; the two older brothers were Giacomo and Federico . Ravi was a handsome , cheeky , disreputable Lothario type who was at that moment getting sloshed on vodka in the kitchen with Indrani 's teaching assistant . " Seriously , you look really good , not that you do n't always look good , " said Indrani . " What 's going on ? " <br> " I 'm flirting , " I said recklessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " Are you going to fuck him ? " she whispered . She was tipsy , obviously , and kidding ; Indrani tended to be idealistic and even moralistic about marriage , probably because she was single . <br> " No . " I laughed , but I did not say it emphatically . <br> Mick handed me a full glass of wine , which I took without looking at him . <br> " Hello , Indrani , " he said . " Your apartment is lovely . " <br> " Well , thanks . I was lucky ; I bought at the right time . " Indrani had a soft , round , open face and doelike brown eyes . Her shoulder-length hair was golden and shiny and straight , like a little kid 's ; her tall body was charmingly ungainly , slightly plump , and breasty . Although she was now a middle-aged professor at an Ivy League school , she had never lost the disarmingly naive ingenue quality that had instantly endeared her to me and won my trust when I was a shy eighteen-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian ; she was English and Danish . She had been born in Costa Rica to hippie parents who had later moved to the Bay Area , where she had grown up . Unfortunately for Indrani , given this upbringing , she was by nature deeply reserved and emotionally conservative . As a kid , she had chafed with embarrassment and discomfort at all the naked tripping adults at happenings , the peach-and-lentil burger suppers , the patchouli-scented , jerry-rigged VW vans , the peace marches , having to wear used clothes from the People 's Park free box . Her mother was the only daughter of a very rich man , but Indrani had n't fully realized this until she was given access to her trust fund at the age of twenty-one . <br> " Hey , Josie , " she said , turning her lambent gaze on me , " I 've been meaning to ask , have you heard anything from Raquel lately ? What 's going on with her new boyfriend ? She would n't even tell me his name , but she said he 's exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josie , then , not Josephine , " said Mick . " Suits you , actually . " <br> I was so turned on by the sound of his voice in my ear , I could have raped him right there . I was feeling loose and wild and punchy . I had spent the past ten years , it seemed to me now , with my muscles clenched , eyes narrowed , shut up in a dark , too-small , sterile room , trying desperately but vainly to make it feel homey and capacious . The door out of my cage , my cell , had been right there all along and I had just flung it open ; now that I could see outside to light , color , life , freedom , I felt that there was no closing it , ever again . <br> " Yeah , " I said , almost giggling like a kid . " I have n't talked to her for a couple of weeks , but she said the thing with the new boyfriend is very hush-hush for some reason , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she 's got a new album in the works . It 's her big comeback . Apparently , she 's put together an amazing band , and they 've been in the studio all fall . " Raquel had also told me that she was getting a little sick of Indrani 's earnest , self-involved E-mails , but I did n't mention that bit of news . <br> " Raquel Dominguez ? " Mick asked . <br> " The very same , " I said . <br> He looked impressed , the starfucker . " How do you know her ? " he asked . <br> " College , " I said . <br> " We were all three best friends , " Indrani added warmly . <br> I thought of what Raquel had just said to me about her and felt guilty and complicit , even though I was innocent . <br> In the fall of 1980 , more than a quarter of a century ago , Indrani and Raquel and I had been newly arrived freshmen with consecutive alphabetical last names at a small liberal-arts school tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Sensing a shared ironic yet romantic outlook , we had immediately formed a solid , seemingly permanent triumvirate . The three of us had rented a ramshackle old house together off campus . We majored unanimously in English , wore one another 's thrift-store clothes , cooked big meaty dinners , and threw parties at which we all took mushrooms or MDA and played the Talking Heads , the Specials , Elvis Costello , Al Green . We passed boyfriends around amicably and casually-at least two and sometimes all three of us had slept ( but never at the same time ) with Joe the chem major , Stavros the history major , Dave the anthro major , Jonathan the anthro major , and Jason the anthro major ( we 'd had a thing for anthropologists , for reasons we could never quite fathom ) . We never slept with one another . Straight girls sleeping together just for youthful sport was , we all tacitly agreed , a clich , and of course we called ourselves girls , not women-feminist didacticism , along with earnest vegetarianism , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the majority of the student body , which suited us fine . <br> Continues ...
