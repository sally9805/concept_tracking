That 's enough miracle for me . A WOMAN ENTERS . HER FACE IS FRAMED BY A SOLITARY SPOT . p. 73 WOMAN How do you find closure when there is no body ? I keep hoping , it 's just a bad dream and I 'm going to wake up , with Roger in bed next to me with that ashtmatic snoring that sometimes keeps me up at night . I 've prayed . I 've mourned .

( BEAT ) We held a prayer service in his memory , . I 'm struggling to make peace with it . I 'm struggling to find closure , but it 's so hard when there 's no body to bury .
