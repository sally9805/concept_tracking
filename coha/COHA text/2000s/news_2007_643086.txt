<p> For the powers at the Creative Artists Agency , Hollywood 's pre-eminent talent representative , the coming blockbuster " Transformers " has already brought a lesson in the cold-hearted ways of corporate entertainment . <p> The outsize robot adventure movie was born when the talent agency connected Hasbro  --  a client , and owner of the Transformers toy line  --  with DreamWorks , Paramount and another longtime associate , Steven Spielberg , among others . As the project grew , at least 10 Creative Artists clients picked up credits , including the writers , several stars and both Mr. Spielberg and Brian Goldner , Hasbro 's chief operating officer , who are executive producers . <p> But a scant month before the picture 's release on July 4 , Hasbro decided to jettison Creative Artists and jump to the rival William Morris , which represents the director of " Transformers , " Michael Bay . <p> So it goes in the new Hollywood . Loyalty stops at the bottom line , and even the most powerful of agencies is finding it can be tougher to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperamental star . <p> Wayne Charness , Hasbro 's senior vice president for corporate communications , credited Creative Artists for its " invaluable assistance " in hooking it up with DreamWorks and Paramount . " For that , we 'll certainly be eternally grateful . " <p> But , in explaining the corporate kiss-off , Mr. Charness added , " William Morris , from an entertainment point of view , is best able to deliver something for us now . " <p> For Creative Artists , the loss of Hasbro is hardly a show-stopper . But the embarrassment comes just as it is trying to prove that it can mirror , if not exactly match , the intricacy and reach of the media conglomerates and consumer and technology companies that have come to define the entertainment world . <p> In recent years , the agency has been quietly shifting its center of balance . It is fighting to protect core movie , television and music businesses that are confronted by changing technology and consolidation among buyers , even while adding new divisions that are meant  --  if they keep their footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain future . <p> Nested since January in a new glass-sheathed Century City tower , Creative Artists has doubled in size in the last five years to about 300 agents and executives , and roughly 700 employees over all . In that time , it not only raided competitors for agents and talent in the movie and television businesses , but began representing athletes and added dozens of marketers and licensing operatives who are supposed to keep pace with the likes of Coca-Cola , Delta , eBay and , until lately , Hasbro . <p> Whether brokering exclusive entertainment for Delta flights or setting up " lifestyle " tours on the skateboard circuit , the agency 's new businesses mostly involve transactions between talent or mainstream entertainment companies and a widening ring of customers . <p> To outsiders , the logic of that push has not always been clear . Competitors complain privately of what they often see as a simple urge for dominance . And the expansion has created new pressures within the 32-year-old agency , which is scrambling to keep its growing list of more than 2,000 clients employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In recent weeks , agency watchers have been intrigued by some belt-tightening at Creative Artists , which ordered agents to refrain from extras like first-class plane tickets . That measure , reported by the Deadline Hollywood blog , was widely viewed as a response to the added cost of the new quarters and the need to pay $1-million-plus salaries to agents snatched from William Morris , Endeavor , International Creative Management or the United Talent Agency . <p> Yet the agency 's basic challenges are no different from those of major competitors , who have been similarly reaching for the next rung , if not always on so grand a scale . And its success or failure is likely to tell whether talents as varied as Will Ferrell , Tom Cruise , Jerry Bruckheimer , Derek Jeter or Norah Jones  --  Creative Artists clients all  --  will maintain their leverage against evolving media giants like the News Corporation and Viacom or make new fortunes from the nonentertainment companies that are looking to Hollywood . <p> Citing a longstanding policy against public discussion of their affairs , the agency 's executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its president , has joined fellow managing partners Kevin Huvane , Rob Light , Bryan Lourd , Rick Nicita and David O'Connor in maintaining official silence about the company 's inner workings since the late 1990s . ( A rare public glimpse of ownership came in 2002 , when a filing in Mr. Huvane 's divorce showed his stake at the time to be 7.9121 percent . ) They were only a bit more talkative last decade , as they weathered a storm of agent and client defections in the wake of their 1995 purchase of Creative Artists from its co-founders : Michael S. Ovitz , Ron Meyer and Bill Haber . <p> Their adviser in the buyout was the mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer Martin Lipton . He has since helped to engineer a growth strategy meant to give Creative Artists a command over the talent world complete enough that clients , in theory , would find internal support for virtually any interest , while anyone approaching the entertainment business would find dealing with the agency an inevitability . <p> ( A recent Web video , " The Wrath of CAAA , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment , mate , apartment , mother and dog are usurped by an all-powerful agency . ) <p> Mr. Lipton 's counsel to the partners , he said in a recent e-mail exchange , was " to follow their instincts and engage in related areas that benefit from the great expertise that they have perfected in their basic business . " <p> Creative Artist 's new strategy , which superseded Mr. Ovitz 's earlier and limited foray into advertising , pushed the notion that corporations , talent and new technology would combine to create growth even as the recording industry faltered , television networks fractured and studios clamped down on costs . <p> Some of the initiative 's successes have been as obvious as the Coke cups in the hands of the " American Idol " judges . In one of its more triumphant gambits , Creative Artists 's marketers helped assemble the hit show for the producer and client Simon Fuller by lining up Coca-Cola , another client , as a backer even before the Fox network became involved . <p> In other forays , the agency 's marketers joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Fitch 's Hollister brand , and helped Delta reclaim its image as an upscale air carrier by associating it with " Project Runway . " More recently , Creative Artists took on Joost , the Internet entertainment provider , as a client , and connected Mr. Ferrell and his partner Adam McKay with backers from Sequoia Capital , the Silicon Valley venture capital firm , to start FunnyOrDie.com , a comedy site . <p> Years ago , after rejecting a possible merger with United Talent as being too complex , Creative Artists instead undertook a buildup in the more traditional areas of Hollywood talent , picking off clients including Mr. Ferrell , Kate Winslet , Matthew McConaughey and Jim Carrey . Once smaller than William Morris and International Creative Management , Creative Artists now counts slightly more film and television clients than either , according to lists culled from Baseline StudioSystems , a data service owned by The New York Times Company . ( None of the three agencies disclose exact client counts . ) <p> At least some evidence indicatesthat less grandiose agencies are occasionally better able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , found that during the 2006-7 television season , Endeavor had the most clients at work on broadcast and cable shows , with a total of 737 , to the bigger agency 's second-ranked 667 . <p> Yet a talent agency 's revenue comes overwhelmingly from its big earners , and Creative Artists has an abundance of those in all of its main businesses , including sports , where a rapid expansion over the last year brought Mr. Jeter from baseball , Peyton Manning from football and the basketball star Allen Iverson , along with about 350 others , into the fold . <p> Operatives who represent the agency 's huge list are for the most part layered into eight floors of its Gensler-designed headquarters , which is being called " the building with a hole in it , " for the 100-foot space between its bridged wings . ( Outlying offices have spread to New York ; Nashville ; Kansas City , Mo. ; St. Louis ; London ; Beijing ; Stockholm ; and Calgary , Alberta , and Creative Artists has an ownership stake in Shepardson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Interiors veer from the cold pallor of assistants ' rows outside the agents ' quarters to the day camp warmth of a patio where lowly players in red company T-shirts have been known to hand out treats at a midafternoon ice cream social . <p> And the inner sanctum is a vast , high-gloss and ultracorporate conference room . <p> Yet the contretemps with Hasbro points to some vulnerabilities that come with being the mightiest talent agency in Hollywood , not the least of them the difficulty of minding what has become a very large store . <p> According to Mr. Charness of Hasbro , the company initially came to Creative Artists for help in connecting its games and toys with a wide range of promotions . As things fell out , however , it did not always need the agency 's guidance in navigating worlds it had mastered on its own . When striking a deal for a mobile phone game based on the " Transformers " film , for instance , Glu Mobile dealt directly with the toymaker , without relying on Creative Artists 's gaming expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jill Braff , Glu Mobile 's general manager of the Americas . <p> Mr. Bay 's agents at William Morris , meanwhile , detected Hasbro 's hunger for more movies . So they began shaking down clients  --  the agency term of art is " packaging within "  --  for ideas that are likely to surface as half a dozen projects for the toy company in the next couple of months . <p> In short , Hasbro wanted to go Hollywood . And Creative Artists , apparently , had become too busy  --  or too fancy  --  to make that happen . " We 're moving to William Morris as an entertainment client , " Mr. Charness said . <p> #
