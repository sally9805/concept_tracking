<p> In the pursuit of an elusive enemy the US loosely labels AQI ( Al Qaeda in Iraq ) , US Green Berets and soldiers in this remote corner of Iraq have enlisted the help of a new ally that they have christened LRF , the " Legitimate Resistance Force . " <p> It includes ex-insurgents , police dropouts with checkered backgrounds , and former Al Qaeda-linked fighters - all united by a desire to rid Diyala Province of the network 's influence , say US officers . <p> " A lot of them are former Al Qaeda operatives ... but when they saw the stealing , murder , and terrorism , they realized it was not the way forward for Iraq , " says Maj. John Woodward of San Antonio . <p> But the risks of such a temporary solution are high , say critics , and the plan could foster new , powerful militias outside the control of the Iraqi Army . It 's a strategy that also threatens to further fuel sectarian battles as LRFs are largely Sunni , posing a major threat to Shiite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early to judge the effectiveness of this new group , but its creation clearly demonstrates a desire by the US to look for grass-roots solutions amid increasing frustration with the combat readiness - and even loyalty - of Iraqi forces . <p> It also seems to indicate that the Americans are willing to take a short-term gamble on the LRFs in order to show some successes in the fight against AQI before September , when a highly anticipated progress report on Iraq is due to Congress . <p> The idea for LRFs was born out of the links US troops have sought to foster with Iraqi tribal leaders in Diyala Province as part of the US-led offensive " Arrowhead Ripper , " which has been under way here for about a month . <p> But the LRF initiative has little in common with the high-profile tribal Anbar Salvation Council , which was formally endorsed by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and helped reduce violence there . Mr. Maliki has backed a Diyala version of that group called the Isnad ( support ) Council , but it has had much less impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ethnic , and sectarian makeup . <p> Maliki warned US forces last month against creating new militias in their fight against Al Qaeda-linked operatives . He insisted that all collaboration with local groups must be done through his government . <p> " What the Americans are doing is very risky and unwise . They are planting the seeds for future wars , " warned Sami al-Askari , a parliamentarian close to Maliki , commenting on groups like the LRF . <p> After a raid , holding the ground <p> Early last week , the US bombed suspected AQI hideouts and several bridges over the Diyala River that were said to be used by the militants in the farmlands of Sherween , about 35 miles northeast of Baquba . On the ground , about 200 Iraqi and US soldiers along with members of the LRF clashed with militants in Rabie Najem , a Sherween-area village . <p> The US military said it killed 20 " Al Qaeda terrorists " and detained 20 in the operation , which it qualified as a success . <p> " It 's very important that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US military helped us , we need to hold the terrain . I have 40 of my guys waiting for me , " says Najem Abdullah , one of the LRF members , in an interview at the US base Normandy the day after the bombing raid . <p> Mr. Abdullah and three of his comrades , all Sunnis from the Jubour tribe , were brought back to the base after the operation to talk to a US special forces team , which is charged with vetting them and supplying them with ammunition , according to officers in the 6th Squadron of the US Army 's 9th Cavalry Regiment stationed at Normandy . <p> Mr. Abdullah is a former policeman and said he once collaborated with insurgent groups like the 1920 Revolution Brigades , one of the earliest Sunni Arab insurgent groups that fought US presence after the invasion . His friend Mazen Hamid is also a former Iraqi police officer and said that several of his relatives have joined the ranks of the Al Qaeda-linked militants and that they were being paid about $300 per operation . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages who are groveling from poverty , " says Raad Abed , another member of the group . <p> They described how the Al Qaeda-linked fighters , many of them masked and clad in black and wearing headbands bearing the words " Islamic State in Iraq , " raided several villages in Sherween 10 days ago , blowing up homes and killing anyone associated with the government . <p> The militants extorted about $3,000 from one wealthy local sheikh and took over mosques broadcasting over loud speakers : " Long live the Islamic State in Iraq , " according to Mr. Hamid . <p> Most of them were indigenous fighters with a few Arab nationals among them , says Hamid . This matched the assessment of several US Army officers in the area . <p> Hamid said that out of an original population of about 400 only 40 men from Rabie Najem are left . His own wife fled farther north , and he might join her soon if the campaign to reclaim their village fails . <p> Last week , neither he nor his 40 LRF comrades were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grips of AQI militants , who even rebuilt , within hours , all the footbridges destroyed by the US aerial bombardment just two days before , according to Col. Mahmoud Tayeh , the police chief in the Sherween area 's main town , Dalli Abbas . <p> Fear of the militants has also crept up to Dalli Abbas itself . Nearly 100 of the 180 policemen in town quit after the mutilated body of one of their colleagues was found outside the station . Attached to it was a succinct handwritten message : " Quit or you 're next . " <p> Colonel Tayeh says that the fleeing policemen took with them AK-47s and pistols , and added that " some of them were coerced to join the terrorists . " <p> The remaining policemen slept at the station . When they ventured out to the town 's potholed and garbage-littered streets , they wore black ski masks for fear of being identified by militants . And , in a further twist , some of these same holdouts are suspected of being on the payroll of Al Qaeda militants , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine line between friend and foe provide a hint of the dangers associated with this new US strategy despite its short-term viability . <p> " The long-term problem is that you are working with fractured social forces , " says Toby Dodge , an Iraq expert at Queen Mary , University of London . <p> " The danger is that once they run Al Qaeda out , they may turn on you , the Iraqi government , or both . " <p> Lt. Col. Keith Gogas , who commands the Diyala-based 6-9 Army unit , agrees with the concept of the LRF , but says he thinks the term itself may be problematic . He 's working to cement local ties in other creative ways . <p> Last Friday , he reunited a local tribal sheikh with his nephew , whom he helped get released from a US-run prison after the man had been detained for nearly 10 months on suspicion of being a member of the Shiite Mahdi Army militia and committing crimes against Sunnis in Diyala . <p> " You see how loyal and truthful the Americans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he puts his arm around Colonel Gogas . " My tribe and I are eternally indebted to Gogas . " <p> Abu Saida , the predominantly Shiite town of Shiekh Saad , has come a long way from being one of the most violent in Diyala to the most cooperative with US forces in the fight against extremists . <p> But just as the line between friend and foe is murky so , too , is the division between war and peace . <p> As Gogas and his men returned to their base , they encountered Iraqi policemen on the road who reported an attack on the mixed village of Harbitla in which 12 Shiites were killed . Separately , the commander of the Iraqi Army battalion who the Americans had been working with was killed by a roadside bomb . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2007 . The Christian Science Monitor
