Two more decrepit buildings came down in June in Weinbergweg , a leafy suburb of the dismal industrial city of Halle in the former East Germany . In the 1970s , Halle was the G.D.R . ' s center for chemical production and one of its most heavily industrialized cities . But 14 years after East Germany 's unification with West Germany , the city 's chemical factories are closed , and some 75,000 residents  --  a quarter of the total  --  have moved away in search of jobs . So many people have left Halle , in fact , that the city is demolishing scores of vacant apartment blocks . <P> By almost any measure , Halle is the worst place in Germany , a symbol of what 's wrong with the nation . Unemployment is about 20% , twice the national rate , and the average income is just $26,300 , Germany 's lowest . " It 's clear we will never return to the industrial city of the past , " says Halle mayor Ingrid Haussler . But the two buildings demolished are actually signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for Halle and Germany . Once used as Soviet barracks , they were knocked down to make room for a sprawling $365 million science-and-technology center taking shape on the city 's western edge . Sixty companies and 19 educational institutions  --  active in such fields as biotech , nanotech and environmental science  --  have settled there so far , and 2,500 new jobs have been created . Probiodrug , a biotech start-up that has won acclaim for its research on diabetes and acquired a clutch of lucrative licensing agreements with big pharmaceutical firms , is one of the early tenants . " Halle has a unique situation , " says Probiodrug CEO Hans-Ulrich Demuth . " There 's a strong university in the field of biosciences and a highly educated and motivated work force here . " <P> Halle has a long way to go before it lifts itself off the bottom of Germany 's prosperity list , and one science park does not amount to a new Industrial Revolution . Since unification , Germany has spent on the former East a staggering $1.46 trillion , much of it squandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was wasted . The presence of world-class companies like Probiodrug proves that even the most downtrodden town can shake off years of lethargy and begin a comeback . If Halle can do it , can the rest of Germany be far behind ? <P> As the economy begins to stir from a decade of stagnation that has rattled the nation 's self-confidence , Germans are again making ambitious plans for the future . Nobody is predicting a boom , but there are signs that Germany is ready to reassert itself as the economic engine of Europe . The economy is growing again , albeit slowly . The heart of Berlin , cut in two for 28 years by the infamous Wall , is now a showplace . The DZ Bank with its magnificent vaulted roof , the Jewish Museum with its lightning-bolt shape and the Sony Center in Potsdamer Platz with its circus-tent glass roof are all signs of a country bouncing back .
