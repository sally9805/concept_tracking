Foreword AL FRANKEN , AMERICAN HERO BY ANONYMOUS // When Al Franken asked me to write a foreword to this astonishing and profoundly moving book , he had only one condition : that I remain anonymous . // " Why ? " I asked . " Having a big name like mine on your cover would be an enormous feather in any author 's cap . " // " That 's exactly the point , " he responded . // Al , you see , is too modest to want to call attention to the fact that he and I are such close friends . Typical Al . He always hides his light . // I reluctantly agreed to his condition , but in return I extracted one of my own . In exchange for concealing my famous identity , I demanded total control over the text of this foreword . I knew Al too well to give him the chance to edit out all the well-warranted praise I intended to heap on him . But even though this enthusiastic foreword will no doubt embarrass Al , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full truth about this great American and about this book . I believe it to be not only the finest volume he has written , but perhaps the Great American Nonfiction Hardcover itself . // The Truth is a very different kind of book than the ones this multifaceted genius has given us before . Oh , it 's funny . ( How could Al Franken not write a funny book ? ) But it 's more than that . Gone is the familiar cast of villains : the psychotic Ann Coulter , the sex-addicted Bill O'Reilly , the drug-addicted Rush Limbaugh . Consigned to their own personal hells by their failings as human beings , Franken mercifully leaves them be . Ann Coulter has been banned as effectively from these pages as from the intellectual salons to which she so desperately craves admittance . // In The Truth , the fish are bigger , and the fry is deeper . // Franken 's targets this time include both people-Bush , Cheney , Rice , Rove , DeLay-and something new : ideas . In particular , the idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right . Al Franken ai n't buyin ' it . // Using access to confidential documents and firsthand accounts , Franken weaves the true story of the Making of the President 2004 , starring the Three Horsemen of the Republican Apocalypse : Fear , Smears , and Queers. // Franken shows more than how Bush won . He shows what Bush won . ( Or in the case of a mandate , what he did n't win. ) // But this story chronicles more than a rise . It chronicles a fall . And what a fall ! Was Bush like Icarus , simply a man who dared to dream-a man who flew too close to the sun ? Or like Daedalus , a man who equipped his son with unsafe wings made of easily melted beeswax ? // As Franken makes clear , the answer is both-and neither . // If you doubt that Icarus has fallen , then I say these words to you : Terri Schiavo , Social Security , Ahmed Chalabi , Tom DeLay , and Iraq . // But this book is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics . Far more . It is something new for Franken . And , I would argue , for literature . Here , Franken has taken a single stem cell-the English language-and grown from it a fully functional kidney with which to purify the blood of the body politic. // In the rarified sphere of contemporary general-audience nonfiction , few books live up to the promise offered by their title . Fewer still , their subtitle . But in The Truth ( with jokes ) , the author lives up to not only his title and his subtitle but , most important , to the name that appears on the cover .
