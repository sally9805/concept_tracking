Introduction : Life on Planet India // I remember the last time the world was talking about India . It was a fleeting fashion moment following the Beatles ' trip to Rishikesh . Nehru collars and beads came into fashion , along with paisley motifs in psychedelic colors . Transcendental Meditation became the latest fad for stress relief . Laugh-In replaced Leave It to Beaver as the iconic American show . India was suddenly cool . Countercultural types embraced India as the antithesis of the West , lost to the empty materialism of the famous " plastics " scene in the movie The Graduate . India was n't backward ; it was wise and spiritual . But then the West moved on . Plastics prevailed , and India faded into the background . // My Indian father 's family lived in Bombay . Every few years , we prepared for the incredible journey to the other side of the world . We collected precious supplies for our relatives in India : jeans and sneakers for our growing cousins , huge jars of Tang , later giant bottles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our family mailed us lists , and we stuffed whatever we could into our suitcases . // Living in Bombay in 1967 and 1968 , I felt like I had been exiled from the real world . My grandparents ' flat in Juhu , though surrounded by the homes of Bollywood stars , had no television . Across the main road near the apartment building was a reeking slum . The only relief from the paralyzing heat was to sit under a crazily beating fan . Everything was different : the food , the language , the climate , the rules of what could and could n't be worn , what could and could n't be said . There was no privacy . From early morning until late at night , I could hear neighboring housewives banging pots , parents screaming at children , Hindi film songs blasting , and bicyclists ringing their little bells . // In the morning the milkman came around with his cow . My grandmother or one of my aunts brought a brass pot down to him and he squatted next to the cow and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep a keen eye on the milkman to make sure he did n't , via a well-concealed tube , water down the milk . We took the milk upstairs and boiled it . While I sipped hot milk mixed with Ovaltine , I dreamed of dragging my fingers through the condensation on the outside of a tall glass of cold milk . // My aunt and uncle live in Gurgaon now , a booming suburb south of New Delhi . They have two refrigerators and buy pasteurized milk in sealed plastic bags . A huge , flat-screen television with cable brings hundreds of Indian and foreign channels into their living room . They keep in touch with family dispersed around the world via e-mail and telephone . Air conditioners in the bedrooms keep the apartment pleasantly cool . A late-model Honda four-door sedan is parked downstairs . // From the rooftop terrace of my aunt and uncle 's flat , I can see buildings going up everywhere , the little tarps of the migrant construction workers dotting vacant lots . Women in full gathered skirts and flowing half-saris , arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freshly mixed cement in baskets on their heads to the men who transfer the burden onto their own heads before scrambling barefoot up rickety scaffolding to deliver the wet mass . Near the tarps , a child runs crazily next to an old tire he urges forward with a stick . Beyond him , a Citibank office tower rises into view . // On a recent trip to India , I sat in the new Bombay domestic airport waiting for a flight on Kingfisher Airlines , whose slogan is " Fly the Good Times , " my laptop propped on my knees . I typed in the code from the card I had just bought from a Tata Indicom kiosk and immediately got a strong wireless connection . On the way to the airport from the old family flat in Juhu , I had passed forlorn groups of destitute families , huddled under an unfinished highway overpass on thin mats of filthy cotton , the little babies naked and snot-nosed . It was the kind of scene that profoundly shocks first-time visitors to India and to which I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gleaming terminal among the Indian and foreign businessmen and families waiting for one of the many flights departing for every part of the country , I thought about the India I lived in forty years ago and India today , and I wondered where India would be forty years from now . // " ' Where are we headed with our billions ? ' That is the question India is asking itself , " a friend told me in New Delhi over a drink . It is a question the entire world should be asking . // Half my family is Indian . During most of my lifetime , India changed , but did so almost imperceptibly . Then , suddenly , the changes began to come with dizzying speed . With each arrival , I felt I was watching time-lapse photography . No democracy in history has undergone a transformation of India 's magnitude or velocity . // Traveling the length and breadth of the country , I witnessed the churning of India 's incredible metamorphosis . I interviewed hundreds of people who shared their visions of India 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I talked to the people in the culture industries who are reimagining India 's ancient stories for a new global audience . I met businessmen who are dedicated to including the poor in India 's booming economy , even as they take their companies global . I listened to household servants , taxi drivers , farmers , and street vendors talk about their daily struggles , their frustrations , their faith that their children 's lives would be better . Everywhere , I was stunned by the pride , the bullishness , the sense that this moment belongs to India . I caught a glimpse of India 's future , its possibilities and its perils , and in that future I saw our own , for as goes India , so goes the world . // The World in Microcosm // No other country matters more to the future of our planet than India . There is no challenge we face , no opportunity we covet where India does not have critical relevance . From combating global terror to finding cures for dangerous pandemics , from dealing with the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rebalancing stark global inequalities to spurring the vital innovation needed to create jobs and improve lives  --  India is now a pivotal player . The world is undergoing a process of profound recalibration in which the rise of Asia is the most important factor . India holds the key to this new world . // India is at once an ancient Asian civilization , a modern nation grounded in Enlightenment values and democratic institutions , and a rising twenty-first-century power . With a population of 1.2 billion , India is the world 's largest democracy . It is an open , vibrant society . India 's diverse population includes Hindus , Muslims , Sikhs , Christians , Buddhists , Jains , Zoroastrians , Jews , and animists . There are twenty-two official languages in India . Three hundred fifty million Indians speak English . // India is the world in microcosm . Its geography encompasses every climate , from the snowcapped Himalayas to palm-fringed beaches to deserts where nomads and camels roam . A developing country , India is divided among a tiny affluent minority , a rising middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 per day . India faces all the critical problems of our time  --  extreme social inequality , employment insecurity , a growing energy crisis , severe water shortages , a degraded environment , global warming , a galloping HIV/AIDS epidemic , terrorist attacks  --  on a scale that defies the imagination . // India 's goal is breathtaking in scope : transform a developing country of more than 1 billion people into a developed nation and global leader by 2020 , and do this as a democracy in an era of resource scarcity and environmental degradation . The world has to cheer India on . If India fails , there is a real risk that our world will become hostage to political chaos , war over dwindling resources , a poisoned environment , and galloping disease . Wealthy enclaves will employ private companies to supply their needs and private militias to protect them from the poor massing at their gates . But , if India succeeds , it will demonstrate that it is possible to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty . It will prove that multiethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will show us how to save our environment , and how to manage in a fractious , multipolar world . India 's gambit is truly the venture of the century . // In Search of a New Paradigm // " Our biggest challenge is the challenge nobody has solved in the world : how to grow equity , " Mukesh Ambani , chairman of Reliance Industry , India 's biggest company , told me . Can liberal democracies forge a global market economy that is environmentally sustainable and reduces inequality ? The United States has failed to achieve this . While it has proven its capacity to generate vast wealth , the so-called Washington consensus has advanced corporate interests over the welfare of average citizens and small businesses , exacerbated gaps between the affluent and the poor , and operated with stunning disregard for the environment . America 's prosperity is dependent on overconsumption of the world 's resources  --  with just 6 percent of the world 's population , the United States consumes 30 percent of the earth 's resources . And it produces a disproportionate share  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological , economic , and strategic dominance is being challenged for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union . Ironically , the communication and information technologies that propelled America to the forefront during the 1990s are now contributing to the erosion of American dominance . These technologies have created a world where time and space are compressed as never before , where ideas , money , services , and people are constantly in motion , freed from the constraints of national boundaries . // The process of globalization spurred by these technological innovations has created what the economist Amartya Sen calls " an age of great affluence , " where billions of dollars are amassed by a few while billions of people barely get by . With China 's rapid rise , on the one hand , and new terrorist threats on the other , one of the truly pressing questions of our time is whether liberal democracies can deliver to all citizens , including the poor , the freedom to realize their human potential . // The irrepressible optimism of America , its conviction that life can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its war on terror , the debacle in Iraq , and a shifting global economy . According to the Pew Global Attitudes survey , world opinion of the United States is at a historical low . Even in India , where the United States continued to be held in dizzyingly high regard long after it had tumbled elsewhere , positive opinion dropped dramatically from 71 percent approval in 2003 to 56 percent in 2006 . Americans themselves feel less secure and less confident about their future . // India and China realize they can not blindly imitate the American model : the earth simply can not sustain billions of people consuming finite resources at American levels , nor churning out pollutants at the rate Americans do . The vast majority of the world 's people can not afford to pay the prices Americans are asked to pay for the foundation of a decent life : quality health care and education . Already beset by extreme inequality and dire environmental and health crises , neither India nor China can allow a small portion of their populations to live an American lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equity , committing important resources to universal health care , affordable housing , unemployment , and other benefits for average citizens . The European Union has emerged as the world 's first supranational political and economic entity , putting centuries of national enmity and the terrible legacy of two world wars in the twentieth century firmly behind it . But Europe is also struggling with high unemployment and the challenge of integrating growing populations of Muslim immigrants . // Under the regime of Vladimir Putin , Russia has squashed opposition voices and moved away from the open society it embraced after the breakup of the Soviet Union . Japan is much too culturally homogeneous to serve as a model for the rest of the world , and it has recently moved toward the far-right end of the political spectrum with calls for a renewed full-fledged military and national education that glosses over Japan 's wartime behavior . China 's sheer size ensures that it will have a great impact on the world order as its economy grows , but China 's system sits uncomfortably with those nations that value democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // India , with its open society , dynamic economy , its commitment to democratizing the institutions of world order and to creating wealth in a way that is inclusive and sustainable , is forging a compelling alternative paradigm . // The Asian Century // " India and China can together reshape the world order , " said Prime Minister Singh to Chinese premier Wen Jiabao when he visited New Delhi in 2005 . Between them , India and China account for 2.4 billion people  --  one-third of humanity . India is the second-fastest-growing economy after China , posting an annual growth rate of 8 percent in 2006 , with the ambition to sustain growth of 9 to 10 percent during the next five years and beyond . India , like China , has embraced a market economy and moved to reap the benefits of globalization . Both India and China see this moment as a historic turning point where the future is gravitating toward Asia . They see the twenty-first century as the Asian century , a time when the institutions that established the global order after World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alignments and a new balance of power . // India and China have resolved a border dispute that had festered since the two countries went to war in 1962 . India has long distrusted China 's close relationship with Pakistan , especially with regard to nuclear weapons ' technologies , but India has put that wariness aside to move its relationship with China forward . Trade between China and India is growing more than 40 percent per year . In 2007 , China will unseat the United States as India 's biggest single-country trading partner . India and China realize they face common challenges of widespread poverty , a growing urban-rural divide , environmental degradation , and galloping energy needs for billions of people . Both know that any one of these problems could derail their impressive momentum , and mire their countries in domestic unrest or regional conflict . // At the same time , India and China are aware that in the race to secure essential natural resources , especially oil and natural gas , and to assert influence over a neighborhood they largely share , they are competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic might and military power , it will never be able to match India 's immense advantage as a democracy . // India 's democracy is a tremendous soft-power asset and a natural safety valve for its citizens ' frustrations . India goes forth in this fragile and rapidly changing world as a friend to superpowers as well as to developing nations , as a global source of cultural creativity and technological innovation , and as an open society . // Young India // India is the world 's youngest country . Fifty percent of India 's people are under the age of twenty-five . By 2015 , there will be 550 million teenagers in India . Long after the populations of Europe , the United States , and even China have grown old , India will still be a young country , with no labor shortages and no lack of customers .

Indians around the world were jubilant . // For Indians , Mittal 's takeover of Arcelor symbolized the coming-of-age of Indian business and the end of a Western commercial imperium . Until Mittal came along , French fears about globalization were emblematized by the Polish plumber willing to work for wages far below French levels . The Indian corporate raider proved a much scarier avatar . Despite Mittal 's assurances that there would be no mass layoffs of workers at Arcelor , whose generous wage-and-benefits packages are everything the French fear losing , many French could n't shake the impression they 'd let the fox into the henhouse. // Shortly after the Mittal Steel coup , Vijay Mallya of India 's United Breweries went after Taittinger champagne .

Tata 's beverage company , Tata Tea , now earns more than two-thirds of its revenues from first-world markets .

Mahindra &amp; Mahindra has been manufacturing tractors in Tomball , Texas , under its U.S. subsidiary Mahindra U.S.A. since 1994 , and in 2003 it opened a new factory near Atlanta , Georgia . Ranbaxy Laboratories , a leading Indian pharmaceutical company , has nine thousand employees in seventeen countries . // Last year , I gave a presentation on India to my daughter 's sixth- grade class . I told them that when they grow up there is a good chance they will work for a Chinese or an Indian company . This did n't seem to bother them at all .

It is going to be difficult for the United States and Europe to accept the fact that Asia , including India and China , but also Malaysia , Singapore , and others , will be the center of wealth-creation. " // The Third Industrial Revolution // " Any business that does not require physical presence can be cosourced , " Azim Premji , CEO of Wipro , one of India 's largest companies engaged in offshore outsourcing , told me at his company 's headquarters in Bangalore . India has become a major source of skilled , low-cost labor , with a corps of English-speaking , highly skilled workers who can compete with the best , especially in technology and science , for a fraction of what a comparable worker is paid in the United States or Europe . // Kiran Mazumdar Shaw , CEO of Biocon , the pioneering Indian biotechnology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives , told me : " India has the potential to be the laboratory of the world .

' " // India is becoming an important center for research and development for scores of major multinational companies . IBM has invested nearly $2 billion in India over the past four years . It plans to triple that to a total of $6 billion over the next two years . IBM now has 43,000 employees in India out of 330,000 worldwide . Intel will invest $1 billion in India over the next five years ; Cisco , another $1.1 billion . Microsoft will invest $1.7 billion and hire 3,000 more employees . // The proportion of jobs in finance , technology , life sciences , human resources administration , and business management outsourced from Europe and the United States to the developing world is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 30 percent by 2015 . By the same year , an estimated 3.5 million white-collar U.S. jobs along with $151 billion in wages will be outsourced , with India the top outsourcing destination . // The world economy is undergoing a major reorganization that is rebalancing jobs and capital investment toward Asia . Information and communications technologies have created an environment where the only jobs that have to remain local are those that require face-to-face interaction . All others can be outsourced to a remote location leveraging digital technologies . Alan S. Blinder , a professor of economics at Princeton University , calls this the third industrial revolution . The first was the shift of labor from farms to factories . The second was the shift from manufacturing to services . The third is a shift made possible by the information age . // Blinder believes that the ultimate dimensions of the third industrial revolution " may be staggering .

" At this point , they are not . In the United States , workers whose jobs have been lost due to offshoring are left largely to their own devices . // With more and more highly skilled jobs in India , brain drain  --  the flow of talent toward the developed countries of the West , especially the United States , that characterized the second half of the last century  --  has developed a countercurrent in this century : brain recirculation . My Indian father , an aeronautical engineer , had hoped to return to India after college in America , but there were no opportunities to match what he could get in the United States . Today , as Indian businesses expand in Europe , and European and American companies move into India , the demand for foreign-educated Indians and Indians with experience in the world of international business is growing .

Indians returning from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their mother country , demanding more efficient services , complaining about corruption , voicing their dissatisfaction with poor infrastructure . // In 2003 , The Indus Entrepreneur group ( TIE ) estimated that fifteen thousand to twenty thousand Indians had left Silicon Valley to return home . Amar Babu of Intel India told me that about 15 percent of Intel 's employees in Bangalore are Indians who have returned from the United States . Many people who return from the United States have imbibed a good dose of entrepreneurial spirit . They are using their entrepreneurship and their money to create new businesses in India . Some are basing themselves in India , some are starting new companies in India while remaining based in the United States . Others are in an airplane so often , they do n't know where they live anymore . // The Indian Renaissance // India 's 1.2 billion people and 20-million-strong diaspora are beginning to flex their cultural and economic muscles .

" You feel like you are one of the Medicis when you are in the studio in India . " // Evidence of India 's renaissance is everywhere . Once again , the world thrills to Indian fashion , Indian music , and Indian-inspired clothes . Indian actors are on television and movie screens across the United States and around the world . Forty years after the Beatles put India on the map of Western consciousness , Indians are situating the West on a new global topography .

A report to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2006 by special rapporteur Jean Ziegler , The Extent of Chronic Hunger and Malnutrition in India , indicated that hunger and malnutrition are bigger problems now in India than they were in the 1990s , and that the gap between those who eat well and those who ca n't get enough to eat has widened .

Generic drugs produced by Indian pharmaceutical companies have driven down the costs of treatment dramatically , in India and in other parts of the developing world . Whether India will be able to conquer the spread of this terrible disease in time to prevent serious damage to its economy is an open question .

This does not remotely approach the scale of job creation India 's growing population requires . Manufacturing will create some of the jobs India 's youth so badly need . New credit products , especially in microfinance , will allow others to launch small-scale businesses .

It must leverage new technologies to minimize environmental damage while maximizing scarce resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India will have to use its proven talent for technological innovation to create the solutions it needs . // India 's new cars , power plants , and factories risk adding millions of pounds of carbon to an already overloaded atmosphere unless the country moves to power its growth with clean , alternative energies . India is the only country with a Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy . It has the potential to become a leader in new technologies for clean energy production . The Indian company Suzlon is an example of how India can scale up alternative energy , and take it global . In just a few years , Suzlon has become one of the world 's leading wind power companies , selling power to utilities in the state of California and other foreign markets . As oil prices rise , alternative technologies are becoming increasingly more attractive . India has the technological acumen and the pressing need to find clean energy solutions . // India is using digital technologies to bring health and education services to the poor in remote rural areas . It is developing generic drugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradigms for delivering quality health care , including state-of-the-art surgeries , to the poor . " We are trying to dissociate health care from affluence , " Dr. Devi Shetty , the founder of Narayana Hrudayalaya heart hospital and one of the most extraordinary people I met in India , told me . " People may continue to be poor , but they will have access to high-tech health care with dignity . " India has also become an attractive destination for medical outsourcing : Americans who can not afford expensive procedures in the United States can travel to India and have them performed for a fraction of the cost . // India is using technology to drive down the cost of basic goods , making them affordable to more and more people . India is producing $20 mobile phones and designing $2,000 cars . It is making low-cost computers that resist high temperatures and repeated power interruptions . It is setting up test models of small-scale power plants run on crop waste , where farmers can sell excess electricity back to the grid . Most people in the world can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . India has the potential to make those goods and services available at prices the whole world can afford . // India 's Way // In his famous speech , broadcast on the radio at the midnight hour of India 's birth as an independent nation on August 15 , 1947 , Jawaharlal Nehru , the country 's first prime minister , articulated the new nation 's promise to its people : // The future beckons to us . Whither do we go and what shall be our endeavor ? To bring freedom and opportunity to the common man , to the peasants and workers of India ; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease ; to build up a prosperous , democratic , and progressive nation ; and to create social , economic , and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman . // These goals remain as inspiring as they have been elusive . India 's poor still wait for opportunity and justice ; too many of their lives are still fraught with poverty , ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploitation of human beings occurs in India  --  indentured servitude , sexual trafficking of women and children , child labor , female feticide and infanticide  --  and the less dramatic but just as debilitating daily violence of poverty , disease , and hopelessness . // Faced with crisis situations it must solve or risk squandering the incredible promise of this moment , India is undertaking the Herculean task of fulfilling the pledges Nehru made at the hour of India 's independence . It has taken the country sixty years to reach this point , not a long time in the career of nations ; no time at all on India 's ancient civilizational time line . // India realizes that it must invent its own way in the world . Over and over , I have heard some version of the following radical strategy for India 's success . The starting premise is counterintuitive : treat every problem as an opportunity . In a nation of more than 1 billion people , begin with the assertion that , in a knowledge economy , every untapped brain is an asset waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear on the most intractable problems but do n't assume that private investment alone can do the job on the scale and at the speed required . Forge partnerships among business , government , and NGOs . Nurture networks and mentor relationships between those who have the know-how and those who want to learn ; between those who have the capital and those who need seed money . Relentlessly drive down costs in order to drive down prices . Listen to the poor ; they know what they need . Empower them by giving them a good education and the means to earn a livelihood . Figure out how to meet their needs , and you will do well . // " By design , " Shiv Sivakumar , who is the creator of ITC 's innovative e-Choupal program that links farmers to markets in rural India , told me , " our models fuse the belief that we can only do well if we do good , and we only do good when we do well . " // Narayana Murthy , the recently retired cofounder of Infosys , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me how he sees it : " The primary role of a corporation is to create wealth , legally and ethically . That is our primary responsibility . In the context of a developing country like India , however , the corporation 's responsibility goes beyond that . You must create goodwill in the society . That does n't mean business should take over the government 's responsibilities . The major contribution where a company can create a public good is in private-public partnerships . " // In the United States , to paraphrase Charles Erwin Wilson , former chairman of General Motors , in testimony he gave to the Senate Armed Services Committee after being named secretary of defense by President Eisenhower , " What 's good for GM is good for the country . " Since this sentiment was uttered in 1952 , GM has fallen on hard times , laying off thirty thousand people in the United States in 2006 . Still , the notion that whatever favors corporate America is good for the American people remains a core concept for U.S. foreign and domestic policy . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its head . They truly believe that their businesses will ultimately succeed to the extent they contribute to addressing the pressing problems of their country . Mukesh Ambani put it succinctly , " What 's good for India is good for Reliance . " // Inclusive Capitalism // Y. C. Deveshwar , chairman of ITC , one of India 's largest corporations , delivered a rousing speech last year to his shareholders . While he was pleased to announce to investors that annual returns were 30 percent , he was truly proud to tell them these results had been achieved " even as your company is creating new benchmarks in Triple Bottom Line performance . " As the head of a company whose traditional business is tobacco , Deveshwar has special incentive to turn ITC into a good corporate citizen . Still , the company 's corporate responsibility profile is impressive . ITC , which was already " water positive , " became " carbon positive " in 2006 and is well on its way to achieving " zero solid waste status . " // The Triple Bottom Line takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Deveshwar attributed ITC 's success across all three of these bottom lines to the company 's values , deeply rooted in a distinctly Indian ethos . This ethos , Deveshwar maintained , " determines choice of corporate strategy , orients such strategy in favor of Indian value chains wherever feasible , and engages the organization willingly in confronting the larger societal challenges of inclusive and sustainable growth . " // Increasingly , some of India 's most visionary leaders are coming around to this new capitalist paradigm that creates wealth and promotes social inclusion and environmental sustainability . India 's government has made a politics of inclusion the centerpiece of its domestic policies , emphasizing improved education for all and enacting a National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to provide a minimum social safety net to India 's rural poor . The reason is simple : there is no other way . // The Power of Imagination // From Anand Mahindra to Mallika Dutt , from Gotham Chopra to Rohini Nilekani , I have heard so many Indians say that the only thing that can hold their country back at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same is certainly true for the rest of us . Our planet teeters on the edge of so many terrifying crises , from global warming to lethal pandemics to the anarchy of terrorism and war . To believe that economic growth and development are possible only by sacrificing the life potential of billions of human beings or by inflicting colossal damage to our shared environment is to suffer from an acute failure of imagination . If India can create a knowledge economy that is an economy attuned to the challenges it faces , if it can change the information age into an age of wisdom , it will save itself  --  and the rest of us as well . // In the best of all possible worlds , India 's politics of inclusion will temper the economic divisiveness of American capitalism , while American-style entrepreneurship will spur India 's economy . India 's commitment to a multipolar world and to the democratization of the emerging world order will curb America 's overt unilateralism . India 's focus on innovation in developing alternative energy sources and in extending educational opportunities , medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India into leadership positions in a host of new areas , forcing the United States to reconsider its policies and priorities . The commitment of Indian companies to doing well by doing good will set the example of an inclusive capitalism that will be a model for the world . The tired old argument that the United States would like to do the right thing  --  for example , reign in the production of greenhouse gases  --  but just ca n't afford to do so will be put to bed as India shows the world no one can afford not to address these problems . By daring to imagine a different world , India will surge forward on a wave of economic growth fueled by innovative solutions to the problems that threaten our collective future . // As Goes India , So Goes the World // No matter which pressing problem we contemplate  --  from global warming to pandemic disease to the energy crisis to yawning gaps between the rich and the poor  --  time is of the essence . With its large population and rapid economic growth , India faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industrialized world . We must pay attention to where India is heading : we are all likely to end up there , sooner or later . // India encompasses all the promise and peril of this critical moment in human history . The Indians I have had the privilege of meeting and who shared their vision and dedication with me marry incredible ambition to problems so terrifying many of us are tempted to pretend they do n't exist . Indians do n't have the luxury of pretending . Ultimately , neither do we . // India is already touching our lives in more ways than most of us realize . In a very real sense , we already live on planet India . This book is about what kind of planet that can be . //
