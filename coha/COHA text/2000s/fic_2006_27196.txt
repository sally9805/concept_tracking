Berkeley Square , London May 1814 In the blue veil of night , three human statues stood clustered behind a prickly screen of holly bushes , their voices carefully held to mere whispers . " He 's just there . " Mary , the eldest of the Royle sisters , poked her white , heavily powdered index finger through a gap in the branches . " Do you see him ? He 's the blond gentleman before the fountain . Is he not exquisite ? " " I can not see anything other than the back of your head . " Her younger sister Anne did not find tonight 's adventure nearly as diverting as Mary did . Since the moment they 'd left their great-aunt Prudence 's house , she 'd done nothing but complain about the nonsensical nature of their invasion of the garden rout next door . But standing hidden along the hedge was perfectly logical to Mary 's way of thinking . They were n't invited to the rout this eve . . . but he was . What else was she supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the gardens only yards away ? No , she was not about to miss an opportunity like this . Until this night , Mary had only seen the viscount five times in passing . And though she was an excellent judge of character -- everyone said so -- she had had to concede that she needed more time to gather a bettersense of him . . . to be sure . For she was nothing if not decisive . And once she made a decision , she never changed her mind . Ever . Being able to watch him from the holly bushes , undetected as she was , would allow her to confirm her initial opinion of him , even though in her heart she already knew her perception was correct . He was exactly as he appeared -- positively perfect . Anne huffed and tugged hard on Mary 's shoulder to move her out of the way . Snapping her head around , Mary grimaced at her sister . It had taken her a full two hours to achieve the correct marbled effect . " You need n't be so impatient . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Obliging her , Anne raised each finger in turn , then lifted her damp palm from Mary 's powdered skin . Mary twisted to peer at the damage to her white finish . " I knew it ! You 've smudged the powder . Your fingers have left prints all over me . " " Will both of you please lower your shrieks ? " Elizabeth , the youngest of the triplets by almost ten minutes , according to their father , blinked her powdered white lashes angrily . " What if we 're caught ? Our family will be ruined . Am I alone in considering this ? " " It 's dark , Lizzie . No one can see us here . " As she stood , Anne tripped on the hem of her Grecian gown , sending a puff of white powder into the air . " Anne is right . " Mary edged around the thick bush . " But we ca n't see or hear what 's going on either . I daresay we have to move closer . " She turned and signaled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elizabeth exchange loaded glances . Oh no . They were n't backing out now . They were going through with this . They were . After all , they 'd promised her . " Do not even consider leaving . This was the plan , or have you forgotten ? We dress in white and powder ourselves , then invade the rout , posing as garden statuary . " Elizabeth huffed at that . " And as I said at the house , your scheme is madness . Though I have to admit , in the moonlight , our marbling looks flawless . The effect is really quite amazing . " Anne flinched as she gazed down at her gleaming white arm . " What else is in this powder anyway ? I feel as though ants are crawling all over me . Lud , Mary , I do n't know how you convinced us to do this . And why -- because you 're smitten with some dashing soldier ? I agree with Lizzie , this is madness . " " There is an ocean of difference between a simple soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viscountcy was newly bestowed on him , by the Regent himself ? It was a grand reward for his valor in battle . " Movement caught Mary 's notice . " Blast , he 's leaving . Come along , we have to catch him up . He 's probably headed for the lawn . " Elizabeth shook her head vehemently . " The only place I am headed is back over the wall , and into a bath to wash this coating of white powder from my person . " She came to her feet , then lent Anne a hand to help her stand . " Please . Not until you 've at least seen him . I am going to marry him , you know . " Mary finished her sentence with a firm single nod . " So you 've said . " Anne brushed the crumpled , dried holly leaves from the knees of her snowy gown . " But you do n't need to marry the man just to secure your future . We 've got the entire season . . . and more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " I am not about to bank my life on such a slim possibility . I am being realistic about our prospects -- and so should you . " She watched the viscount lift a glass to his mouth , saw the crystal sparkle in the moonlight , and a sigh fell from her lips . " Beginning with that gentleman . . . that beautiful gentleman . " " Oh , very well , show me . " Anne stood on the toes of her slippers and peered over the top of the hedge . " Which one is he ? " Mary looked closer and saw that there were two men now . But while her viscount -- because indeed she already thought of him that way : her viscount -- had golden hair , the other man 's hair was as dark as jet , and he stood at least a head taller . " Well , certainly not that hulking giant . My tastes are much more refined . " Mary trotted a few steps along the hedgerow and beckoned for her sisters to follow , which they reluctantly did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There . The one with the cane , " she whispered when her sisters drew alongside of her as she peered over the holly . " What did I tell you ? Such fine , aristocratic features . Shows good breeding .
