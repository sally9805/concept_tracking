It 's Back to School for Secretary " Starbuck " Now this is the way to go back to school : Wrap a supercomfy executive motor coach in yellow to make it look like a real school bus , grab a Starbucks tall Soy Misto , and take two field trips , one to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum for some karaoke and a second to shoot rockets at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base . A dream ? Not for Education Secretary Margaret Spellings . The Bush hipster says that 's exactly what she 's doing this week in a bid to promote math and science and the reauthorization of the administration 's teetering No Child Left Behind Act . She calls her tour " Empowering Parents , Empowering Children , " a slogan that 'll be painted on the bus . The science part takes place in Cleveland , where Spellings  --  President Bush 's American Idol fan  --  will steer her bus to the rock center to have her vocal vibrations measured while crooning a tune by her fave , Stevie Wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of a song , but it 's also the action Congress needs to take to reauthorize No Child Left Behind so all kids can be at grade-level reading and math by 2014 , " she says . Then it 's on to Wright-Pat for a math and science lesson in its Starbase program , where kids launch water-propelled rockets . Just like real pilots , participants get handles , and the coffee-loving Spellings is to be dubbed " Starbuck . " Fox Gets Denver . Will Dems Bail ? It 's the proverbial boxed-into-a-corner situation . Fox News Channel , the cable network boycotted by Democrats running for president , has been handed the duty of televising the Democratic National Convention in Denver next summer . How could the cable station  --  which scrubbed its Democratic debates because candidates worried about bias and refused to participate  --  get the job of providing the pool cameras in the convention hall ? The networks decide . So far  --  surprise  --  none of the candidates have balked . Bush 's Fashion Stamp : Blue Ties Well , it did n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bipartisanship in fashion . His light-blue silk tie is now the rage on both sides of the aisle . Just last week , we saw two presidential hopefuls  --  Sens . Barack Obama and John McCain  --  each sporting one . " It really lightens up a man 's face , and he comes across as more decisive , but in a human sort of way , " says Democratic consultant Donna Brazile . " Blue is the new red . " Some Friend , W 's Mexican Amigo At the White House , the president has got to be muttering " some friend " when he pores over the new autobio from his old buddy Vicente Fox , Mexico 's former leader . That 's because Fox raps his border pal as stubborn and " the cockiest guy I have ever met in my life . " Revolution of Hope , out next month , is a well-written , well-researched book about Fox 's political career and presidency , which coincided with George W. Bush " s . While he expresses a kinship with W , he breaks with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform . He blames Bush 's stubbornness on Iraq for bad international relations , calls his Spanish " grade-school level , " and admits he did n't think Bush would ever become president . " I ca n't honestly say that I had ever seen George W. Bush getting to the White House , " he pens . It 's a One-Way Street in Texas Give former President George H. W. Bush some credit for trying to return balance to politics . He has invited Democratic presidential contenders to speak at his library at Texas A &M; University . But they 're stiffing him : Sen. Hillary Clinton has n't responded , and Sen. Barack Obama rejected the invite outright . A spokesman for the library said the elder Bush wants to give Democratic candidates a chance to explain their views in his effort to " breach the divide " between the parties , and he 's disappointed that none have taken him up on the offer . A Hawk in Treasury Boss 's Future Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson makes no secret of how much he likes his job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he says with a chuckle . Still , with just 15 months left before his term ends , he 's already looking to the future . And it includes placing identifying bands on the legs of young hawks . A famed birder who once chaired the Peregrine Fund and the Nature Conservancy , Paulson says he stays up on his old issues , especially the populations of birds of prey . With the hawk migration upon us , he plans to attend " a number of the hawk watches " to check on their health . " Sometime in the fall of 2009 I 'll be back to banding again , " Paulson says . " But for a while I 'm trying to band asset-backed paper , " he adds in a reference to short-term debt . Next Best Thing to Golfing With Bubba For golf lovers who also happen to be Clinton fans , the Clinton Museum Store has a perfect gift : Bubba 's clubs . Store director Connie Fails tells us that Bill Clinton has offered for sale signed clubs from his personal collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven irons . " Some are very well worn , " Fails says . " It can be at the Smithsonian , or it can be in your golf bag . The golfer who has everything does not have this  --  yet . " They 're not cheap  --  $3,900 gets you one framed club with a picture of Clinton golfing in New Zealand . Still , Fails says she has already sold one package . Sex , Anna Nicole , and Lawsuits Sell All those threats of lawsuits aimed at former TV reporter Rita Cosby , author of the salacious book about Anna Nicole Smith , do n't seem to be hurting sales much . We 're told that Blond Ambition : The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith 's Death is set to debut as No. 10 on the New York Times bestseller list . " It has n't shut us down ; it 's helped , " says a publishing insider of the efforts to squash details like the allegation that Smith 's two main men , photographer Larry Birkhead and lawyer Howard K.
