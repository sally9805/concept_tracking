A three-star general ( Robert Redford ) is busted for exceeding his orders and getting some of his men killed . He 's incarcerated in a tough Army jail commanded by a prissy hard-ass ( James Gandolfini ) who has never seen combat . The former organizes a revolt against the latter 's sadism , wrapping his improbable efforts in the flag . Somehow , joining the prison riot is made to seem an act of high patriotism . Redford underacts , Gandolfini overacts , and this movie is directed with the same air of unreality , the same grim passion for cliches , both cinematic and emotional , that Lurie brought to his first film , The Contender . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
