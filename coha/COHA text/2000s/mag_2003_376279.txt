Deaths from cervical cancer have decreased dramatically in the past 60 years , thanks to early detection by the Pap smear , a screening test that women usually get every year . But a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine finds that for women who are at low risk , the number of additional cancers caught by annual screening is vanishingly small , comparable to the number of men who get breast cancer . This gives statistical support to the advice of the American Cancer Society , which recommended last year that women who have three or more negative tests can be safely screened once every three years . Women in high-risk categories  --  ask your doctor  --  should continue to be screened annually .  --  D.B.
