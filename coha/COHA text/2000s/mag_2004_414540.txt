A canopy of leaves can help shield us from the sweltering sun , creating a cool umbrella-like cover . This small patio nestled under mature hardwoods and pines is a great backyard getaway . High limbs crisscross overhead , allowing only small beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menagerie of well-groomed plants . When Ralph and Sally Anderson of Birmingham step out their back door , they enter a wonderful outdoor room . The space is inviting and lush with attractive foliage and flowers , but this patio was n't always so wonderful . When they moved into the house seven years ago , it was rather boring . Dwarf yaupons and a few other evergreen hollies surrounded a rectangular concrete pad , and the generic planting created little interest . " It was really just a nothing space before , a cement square barely big enough for a few chairs , " Sally says . Seeing Potential After settling into the home , Sally carefully evaluated the backyard patio . A Master Gardener , she has a keen eye for design and could look past the concrete pad and tired plants to see lots of potential . A large brick wall gave the space a nice backdrop . The wall was 8 feet tall in places and curved around the patio , enclosing the space and making it private . Large native oakleaf hydrangeas spilled over the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sally enjoyed the privacy and loved the hydrangeas , but she wanted more diverse plantings and a larger terrace . Time To Work Instead of tearing out the existing patio , Ralph and Sally covered it with flagstone and mortared between the joints . The large , flat stones are smooth , making an excellent walking surface . The terrace was extended to sweep around the side of the house , giving the Andersons more room for outdoor furniture and additional space for entertaining . Building Beds They removed all the existing plants and built a low , dry stacked stone wall around the outside edge of the patio . The area behind the wall was backfilled with topsoil and leaf mold to create a fertile raised bed . " This was really the only way to cope with the poor soil conditions , " Sally says . All the stone , soil , and leaf mold had to be brought into the backyard using a wheelbarrow . Sally recalls that was the hardest part of the project . Water Feature The Andersons installed a small pond and fountain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liner and placed rocks around the edge to hide it . The fountain is directly in front of the den window , creating an enjoyable view from the sitting area inside . Outside , the therapeutic sound of water running over moss-covered stones fills the air . Several goldfish add flashes of life and movement to the pond . The babbling sound of water also attracts birds to the woodsy terrace . Photograph left : A tapestry of foliage adorns Ralph and Sally Anderson 's backyard .

She inherited her grandparents ' love of plants and digging in the dirt . In fact , some of the hostas in Sally 's garden came from their yard . Ferns , caladiums , cast-iron plants , and white impatiens weave through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agarista populifolia ) , Virginia sweetspire ( Itea virginica ) , and gardenia ( Gardenia jasminoides ) add height . Vines also play a key role . Creeping fig ( Ficus pumila ) haphazardly climbs the brick wall , bringing it to life . Ralph made a wire trellis on a section of the wall to support Confederate jasmine ( Trachelospermum jasminoides ) , which has been trained to climb up the wires . Sweet Smell of Success Many of the plants Sally selected are fragrant , adding a nice element to the garden . The Virginia sweetspire , Confederate jasmine , gardenia , and ' Royal Standard ' hosta provide aromatic appeal . Confederate jasmine blooms in spring and early summer with clusters of perfumed , cream-colored flowers . In May and june , Virginia sweetspire produces spikes of tiny flowers . Gardenias are classic Southern shrubs with large , waxy foliage . Their buds unfurl in early summer , releasing a distinctive scent . Hostas are known for showy foliage , but ' Royal Standard ' also has trumpetshaped blooms that appear in late summer or early fall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragrance , " Sally says . " That 's part of the essence of the South , the smell of flowers in the air . " Photograph top : ' Royal Standard ' hosta has showy foliage and large , tubular , sweetly scented flowers . above , left : A copper frog and creeping fig cling to the brick wall , above , right : At dusk , candles give the garden a nice glow . Large hanging baskets make a colorful backdrop . // Furniture Fix-up Sally made cushions , pillows , and a tablecloth to dress up the wrought iron furniture . She chose a floral print that looks right at home in the garden . Ralph hooked up outdoor speakers that surround the patio and pipe in tunes . Low-voltage lighting and strategically placed candles give the garden a nice glow at night . Easy Maintenance The garden looks full and complete , but Sally is always grooming her plants . She says that maintenance is n't that difficult now that most of the plants are established . Sally does have to add a few annuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the perennials have emerged and then fills in any holes . A hidden drip system helps to keep plantings moist during dry periods . Small watering tubes run up the brick wall and down the metal hooks holding the hanging baskets . They keep the thirsty plants full and lush . Many people complain about having shade and not being able to grow anything , but Ralph and Sally have used it to their advantage . " One of the things that drew us to the site was the wooded yard , " Sally says . " You 're in the city , but you still feel like you 're surrounded by nature . " They can enjoy their terrace on the hottest summer days and admire the shade-loving plants that flourish under the big trees .
