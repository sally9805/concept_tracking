1 <p> Present day The Tongue and Groove Strip Club , Southern Louisiana <p> A lap dance for the sexy demon ? " <p> With a firm shake of his head , Rydstrom Woede turned down the half-clad female . <p> " With a lap like yours , I 'll make myself at home , " another told him . " For free . " She cupped one of her breasts upward and dipped her tongue to her nipple . <p> That got him to raise an eyebrow , but still he said , " Not interested . " <p> This was one of the low points of his life , surrounded by strippers in a neon-lit Lore club . He was on edge in this ridiculous place , feeling like the worst hypocrite . If his ne'er-do-well brother found out where he 'd been , he would never hear the end of it . <p> But Rydstrom 's contact had insisted on meeting here . <p> When a pretty nymph sidled up behind him to massage his shoulders , he picked up her hands and faced her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here left him cold , which confounded him  --  since he needed a woman beneath him so badly . His eyes must have darkened , because the nymph quickly backed away . About to lose my temper with a nymph ? Getting angered at one of her kind for touching him was like scolding a dog for tail wagging at the sight of a bone . <p> Lately , Rydstrom had been a constant hair trigger 's turn from succumbing to rage . The fallen king known for his coolheaded reason , for his patience with others , felt like a bomb about to explode . <p> He 'd been experiencing an inexplicable anticipation  --  a sense of building , a sense that something big was going to happen soon . <p> But because this urgency had no discernible source or alleviation , frustration welled in him . He did n't eat , could n't sleep a night through . <p> For the last couple of weeks , he 'd awakened to find himself thrusting against the pillow or the mattress or even into his own fist , desperate for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . Gods , I need a woman . <p> Yet he had no time to woo a decent one . Just another conflict battling within him . <p> The kingdom 's needs always come before the king 's . <p> So much was at stake in the fight to reclaim his crown  --  from Omort the Deathless , a foe who could never be killed . <p> Rydstrom had once faced him and knew from bitter experience that the sorcerer was undestroyable . Though he 'd beheaded Omort , it was Rydstrom who 'd barely escaped their confrontation nine hundred years before . <p> Now Rydstrom searched for a way to truly kill Omort forever . Backed by his brother Cadeon and Cadeon 's gang of mercenaries , Rydstrom doggedly tracked down one lead after another . <p> The emissary he was to meet tonight  --  a seven-foot-tall pus demon named Pogerth  --  would be able to help them . <p> He 'd been sent by a sorcerer named Groot the Metallurgist , Omort 's half brother , a man who wanted Omort dead almost as much as Rydstrom did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy of my enemy ... <p> Just then , a demoness dressed in black leather with cheap makeup on her horns gave Rydstrom a measuring look as she passed , but he turned away . <p> He was ... curious about wicked females , always had been , but they were n't his type  --  no matter what Cadeon occasionally threw in his face when they fought . <p> No , Rydstrom wanted his queen , his own fated female , a virtuous demoness to stand by his side and grace his bed . <p> For a demon , sex with one 's female was supposed to be mind-blowing compared to the random tup . After fifteen centuries , he 'd waited bloody long enough to experience the difference . <p> He exhaled . But now was not the time for her . So much at stake . He knew that if he did n't defeat his enemy this time , his kingdom and his castle would be forever lost . <p> My home lost . His hands clenched , his short black claws digging into his palms . Omort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set himself up as king and welcomed Rydstrom 's enemies , granting them asylum . His guards were revenants , walking corpses , the dead raised to life , who could only be destroyed once their master died . <p> Tales of orgies , sacrifices , and incest in Tornin 's once-hallowed halls were legion . <p> Rydstrom would die before he lost his ancestral castle to beings so depraved , so warped he considered them the most revolting beings ever to walk the earth . <p> Gods help anyone who crosses me this eve . A ticking bomb  --  <p> At last , Pogerth arrived , teleporting inside the bar . The pus demon 's skin looked like melted wax and smelled of decay . The gauze he wore under his clothes peeked out at the collar and cuffs of his shirt . He wore rubber boots that he would empty outside in regular intervals , as was polite . <p> When he sat at Rydstrom 's table , it was to a squishing sound . " My lord and master seeks a prize so rare it 's almost fabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , he 'll deliver something just as fantastical . " Switching to the demon tongue , he asked , " What would you be willing to do for a weapon guaranteed to kill the Deathless One ? " <p> Castle Tornin <p> The Kingdom of Rothkalina <p> When a severed head bounced wetly down the steps from Omort 's throne dais onto the black runner , Sabine casually sidestepped , continuing past it . <p> The head belonged to Oracle Three Fifty-Six  --  as in the number of soothsayers that had been in office since Sabine had come to Tornin . <p> The scent of blood cloyed as revenants mindlessly cleaned up the matching body . <p> And Omort , her half brother and king of the plane of Rothkalina , was wiping off his bloody hands  --  which meant he 'd torn the oracle 's head from her neck in a fit of rage , piqued no doubt by whatever she 'd foretold . <p> Standing tall and proud in front of his ornate gold throne , he wore a raised armor guard over his left shoulder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanked his hip . Atop his pale hair sat the intricate headwear that served as both a crown and an armor helmet . <p> He looked suave and sophisticated , and utterly incapable of yanking a woman 's head off her body . <p> Omort had stolen so many powers  --  pyrokinesis , levitation , teleporting  --  all seized from his other half siblings before he killed them . Yet he could n't see the future . The lack often enraged him . " Something to comment about this , Sabine ? Growing soft ? " <p> She was the only one who dared defy him in any way , and the creatures at court quieted . Lining the halls were members of many of the factions who allied with the Pravus , Omort 's new army . <p> Among them were the centaurs , the Invidia  --  female embodiments of discord  --  ogres , rogue phantoms , fallen vampires , fire demons with their palms aglow ... more beings than could be named . <p> Almost all of them would love to see her dead . <p> " So hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sabine could scarcely be expected to feel sympathy for another . For far too many times she 'd dragged herself up from a pool of her own blood . " Which is a shame , brother , because without her we are as good as blind . " <p> " Worry not , I will find another seer directly . " <p> " I wish you all the best with that . " Soothsayers did n't grow on trees , and already they were wading deep into the recruiting pool . " Is this beheading why you summoned me ? " Sabine 's tone was bored as she gazed around her . She studiously avoided the mysterious Well of Souls in the center of the court , taking in other details of the opulent throne room . <p> Her brother had drastically changed it since the rule of the mighty Rydstrom . He 'd replaced the demon 's austere throne with one made of blazingly bright gold . Tonight , blood lay splattered over the gleaming metal  --  from the oracle 's squirting jugular . <p> Been there .... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his banners emblazoned with his talisman animal : an ouroboros , a snake swallowing its own tail , to represent his deathlessness . Anything simple , he 'd made lavish . And yet , this place still did n't suit the outwardly sophisticated Omort . <p> According to legend , the premedieval Castle Tornin had been created by a divine hand to protect the well , with six bold towers encircling it , and the central court . Though the stones that made up the fortress were rugged , they 'd been placed flawlessly . Tornin was perfectly imperfect . <p> As rough-hewn as its former king was reputed to be . <p> Omort drew back his cape before sitting . " I summoned you half an hour ago . " <p> " Ah , just so . I recall that now . " She and Lanthe had been watching DVDs in Lanthe 's solar-powered room . The sisters probably logged seven hours a day watching movies . Alas , cable was n't forthcoming . <p> As she passed the Viceroy centaur , Sabine peeked down and asked him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see . Your left , my right . " Though his fury was undisguised , he would never challenge her . She had far too much power here . <p> She gave him a wink to remind him of just that , then continued to Omort , " I was going to be here on time . But I had something very urgent to take care of . " <p> " Did you really ? " <p> " No . " And that was all she 'd say on the matter . <p> Omort stared at her in fascination , his yellow irises glowing . But when she removed her own cape , he seemed to shake himself , casting a disapproving look at her garments  --  a scanty bandeau top of gold weave , a leather micro-skirt , claw-tipped gauntlets on her hands , and thigh-high boots . <p> After raking his gaze over her body , Omort settled on her face . She 'd drawn her bold scarlet eye paint in the shape of wings that spread out from her lashes up over her brows all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omort had wanted to make it law that females of value were to obscure their faces with a traditional silk Sorceri mask instead of mere paint mimicking one , and to cover their bodies entirely . <p> He 'd swiftly learned how Sabine felt about that idea . <p> " Actually , Omort , I just came to drink my medicine . " <p> " You 'll get your dose later , " Omort replied , waving a negligent hand . <p> How easy it was for him to dismiss . He was n't the one who needed it to keep from dying a horrific death . <p> " For now , we have something more important to discuss  --  " <p> Hettiah , Omort 's half sister and Sabine 's arch-nemesis , arrived then , hastening up the dais steps to stand beside Omort 's throne  --  her rightful place , since she was his concubine as well as his relation . She must have run here as soon as she 'd heard Sabine was at court , frantic to make sure Sabine did n't steal Omort from her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Sabine 's for the taking , and she would never be taking . <p> Omort ignored Hettiah utterly , keeping his eyes on Sabine . <p> " Important to discuss ... ? " she prompted . <p> " My spies have long been searching for Groot the Metallurgist and monitoring the activities of his most trusted followers . " <p> Groot lived in hiding from Omort , and was one of only two half siblings outside Tornin who still survived . <p> " I 've just learned that he sent an emissary to meet with none other than Rydstrom Woede . " <p> At last , an intrigue ! " Rydstrom and Groot , our two most dangerous enemies allying . This is bad news . " <p> " Something must be done . One of the spies heard the emissary promising a sword forged to kill me . " <p> Everyone at court stilled  --  including Sabine . <p> Omort exhaled wearily . " It wo n't , though . It ca n't . " He almost sounded regretful . " Do you know how many bombs , spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ended me ? " <p> Indeed , Sabine had seen Omort stabbed through the heart , beheaded , and burned to cold ash . And always he rose from a dirty mist like a phoenix , stronger even than before . His very name meant without death . <p> " But Rydstrom must believe it will work , " he said . " The infamously coolheaded demon was seen storming from the meeting , and heard calling his brother Cadeon as he got into his car to speed away toward New Orleans . " <p> " Rydstrom must be on his way to meet him . " Cadeon the Kingmaker , a ruthless mercenary . He was rumored to be able to put any king on a throne  --  except his brother . For centuries , the two had worked together to reclaim Tornin . <p> Which was now her home . Get over it , demons . Not moving . <p> Hettiah cleared her throat . " My liege , if the sword ca n't kill you , then why worry about it ? " <p> " Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The sword could be seen as a rallying point , used as a propaganda tool . " Already little rebellions erupted over the countryside , the demons continuing to clamor for their deposed king . <p> Clamoring still  --  after nine centuries . <p> Sabine often wondered how he 'd earned such fervent loyalty . " So it 's clear I ca n't let the brothers meet , " she said . " I 'll intercept Rydstrom before he can reach the city . " <p> " And then ? " Omort said quietly . " What will you do with him ? " <p> " And then I 'll kill two birds with one stone , " she answered . " This is the prophecy beginning . " Just in time for the Accession . <p> Every five hundred years , that great immortal war took place , and they were on the cusp of it right now . <p> Her gaze flickered over the mysterious well in the center of the court , strewn with sacrifices  --  bloody and unidentifiable body parts . Her future depended on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When she faced Omort , his brows drew together , as if he 'd thought she would balk at bedding a demon . In fact , she was eager to get this over with  --  and then to seize the power that was there for the taking . <p> At last , something to want , to need . <p> Hettiah asked , " What if the demon resists you ? " <p> Sabine 's lips parted . " Have you looked at me lately , Hettiah ? " She turned in a circle , a move that left Omort leaning forward on the edge of his throne , and Hettiah sending her murderous glances . <p> Hettiah was n't without power . In fact , her ability was neutralizing others ' powers . She could erase illusions as easily as Sabine could cast them . Lanthe had nicknamed her Hettiah the Buzz Kill and Aunty-Matter . <p> " Do n't underestimate the demon , " Omort finally said . " He 's one of the most iron-willed beings I 've ever encountered . Do n't forget that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabine exhaled , trying to keep a rein on her notorious temper . " Yes , but I have unique attributes that make this demon 's seduction in the bag . " <p> " You also have a detriment , " Hettiah sneered . " You 're a freak among the Lore . " <p> It was true she was unique  --  a virgin seductress . Sabine chuckled at Hettiah 's statement , then her expression instantly turned cold when she faced her brother . " Omort , put a muzzle on your pet , or I 'll make her one from her intestines . " She rapped her silver-tipped claws together , and the sound rang out in the chamber . <p> Hettiah lifted her chin , but she 'd paled . Sabine had in fact plucked an organ from her . On several occasions . She kept them in jars on her bedside table . <p> But Sabine refrained from this as much as possible , because whenever she fought Hettiah , it seemed to overly excite Omort . <p> " Besides , if the demon somehow resists this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll have a backup plan . " She always had a plan B. <p> " You 'll need it . " Hettiah smirked . <p> Sabine blew her a kiss , the ultimate insult among the Sorceri , who stored poisons in their rings to be mixed into drinks  --  or blown into the eyes of an enemy . <p> " Capture him tonight , and then ... begin . " Omort sounded sickened . Not only was Rydstrom a demon , which most Sorceri viewed as little better than an animal , the fallen king was Omort 's blood enemy . <p> And the time had finally come for Sabine to surrender her virginal  --  hymenally speaking  --  body and her womb to the creature . No wonder Omort had gone into a fury with the oracle . <p> Part of him lusted for the power Sabine could garner . And part of him lusted for her  --  or for women who resembled her , like the red-haired Hettiah . <p> He rose then , descending the steps to stand before Sabine . Ignoring Hettiah 's huff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slowly raised his hand to her face . <p> His bloodstained nails were long , cloudy , and thick . When he pinched her chin , she said in a seething tone , " Now brother , you know I dislike it when men touch my face . " <p> When angered  --  like now  --  Sabine 's surroundings appeared to rock and explode as though from an earthquake , while winds seemed to gust in tempests . Omort hesitantly released her as the court attendees nervously stamped about . <p> " I have the coordinates for the road Rydstrom will be traveling , " Omort said . " Lanthe can open a portal from the dungeon directly to that location , and you can stop him there . It will be a perfect trap . Unless she 's already lost her thresholds power . " <p> Lanthe could still create portals . But her ability was temporarily weakened each time , so she could only manage it once every six days or so . Sabine only hoped she had n't burned one recently . <p> " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sabine said , making him scowl . For some reason , Omort had always loathed being near Lanthe and had decreed that the two sisters would never be together in his presence . <p> " Exactly how long do I have to set this snare ? " she asked . <p> " You must intercept him within the next two hours . " <p> " I go at once . " She had little time to hatch a plot , which irritated her . She adored plotting  --  devising plans and subplans and contingencies  --  and half the fun was the anticipation of a trap about to be sprung . She would dream up scenarios for months , and yet now she had only mere hours . <p> Before she could leave , Omort leaned down and murmured at her ear , " If there were any way around your sleeping with this beast , I would have found it for you . " <p> " I know , brother . " <p> She did believe him in this . Omort would never willingly give her up , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he 'd seen her . He 'd said there was something in her eyes he 'd never seen before  --  the dark knowledge of what it was like to die . Something he could never know . <p> He covered her bare shoulder with a clammy hand , sounding as if he 'd just stifled a groan at the contact . <p> " Do  --  not  --  touch , Omort . " She gritted out the words , making her plaits appear to be striking vipers until he removed his hand . Sometimes she had to remind him that she was as treacherous as the serpents he worshipped . <p> She turned immediately , giving him her back instead of taking three steps away before turning to exit the chamber . When she passed the well , she darted her gaze to it . <p> Soon ... <p> " You wo n't fail me ? " he called after her . " Rydstrom must not reach his brother . " <p> " Consider it done , " she called back with utter surety . How hard could it be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Continues ...
