1 . Joe The strangest memory of my childhood concerns my father 's disappearance . This is what I remember : It was late September . I was nine years old , and my sister Heather was seven and a half . Although summer was officially over and we 'd been back at school for weeks , the weather continued warm and sunny , fall only the faintest suggestion in the turning of the leaves , and nothing to hint at the long Midwestern winter yet to come . Everybody knew this fine spell could n't last , and so on Saturday morning my mother announced we were going to go for a picnic in the country . My dad drove , as usual . As we left Milwaukee , the globe compass fixed to the dashboard -- to me , an object of lasting fascination -- said we were heading north-northwest . I do n't know how far we went . In those days , car journeys were always tedious and way too long . But this time , we stopped too soon . Dad pulled over to the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing but empty fields all around . I could see a farmhouse in the distance and some cows grazing in the next field over , but nothing else : no park , no woods , no beach , not even a picnic table . " Are we here ? " asked Heather , her voice a whine of disbelief . " No , no , not yet , " said our mom , at the same moment as our dad said , " I have to see a man about a horse . " " You mean dog , " Heather said . She giggled . " See a man about a dog , not a horse , silly . " " This time , it might just be a horse , " he said , giving her a wink as he got out of the car . " You kids stay where you are , " Mom said sharply . " He wo n't be long . " My hand was already on the door handle , pressing down . " I haveto go , too . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heather . Stay . " " Where 's the bathroom ? " Heather asked . I was already out of the car and the door closed before I could hear her reply . My father was only a few feet ahead of me , making his way slowly toward the field . He was in no hurry . He even paused and bent down to pick a flower . A car was coming along the road from the other direction : I saw it glinting in the sun , though it was still far away . The land was surprisingly flat and open around here ; a strange place to pick for a comfort stop , without even a tree to hide behind , and if my dad was really so desperate , that was n't obvious from his leisurely pace . I trailed along behind , making no effort to catch up , eyes fixed on his familiar figure as he proceeded to walk into the field . And then , all at once , he was n't there . I blinked and stared , then broke into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only thing I could think of was that he 'd fallen , or maybe even thrown himself , into some hidden ditch or hole . But there was no sign of him , or of any possible hiding place when I reached the spot where he 'd vanished . The ground was level and unbroken , the grass came up no higher than my knees , and I could see in one terrified glance that I was the only person in the whole wide field . Behind me , I heard shouting . Looking back , I saw that a second car had pulled off the road beside ours : an open-topped , shiny black antique . This was the car I 'd noticed earlier coming along the road from the other direction . My mother had gotten out and was now in agitated conversation with a bearded man in a suit , a woman wearing a floppy hat , and two girls . My mother called me . With a feeling of heavy dread in my stomach , I went back to the car . Heather was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me approach , she pressed her face to the window , flattening her nose and distorting her face into a leering , piggy grin . I was too bewildered to respond . " Where 's your father , Ian ? " I shook my head and closed my eyes , hoping I would wake up . My mother caught hold of my arms and shook me slightly . " What happened ? Where did he go ? Ian , you must know ! What did you see ? Did he say anything ? You were with him ! " " I was following right behind him , then he was n't there , " I said flatly . " Yes ! " The cry came from the woman in the old-fashioned car . She nodded eagerly . " That 's exactly what happened ! He just winked out of existence . " She snapped her fingers in emphasis . " I was watching the road , of course , " said the man , sounding apologetic . I had the feeling he 'd said this before . He cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I had noticed two figures in the field , a man and a boy , and when I looked again -- just after Emma here cried out -- there was just the boy . " My mother 's face settled into an aloof , stubborn expression I had seen before when one of us kids , or my father , was being difficult . It meant that she was n't going to waste time on argument . " Take me to him , Ian , " she said . " Show me exactly where he was when you lost sight of him . " I did what she said , although I already knew it was hopeless . We searched that whole field , over and over again , at first quietly , then , in increasing desperation , calling loudly for " Daddy ! " and " Joe ! " The people in the other car , the only other witnesses to what had happened , stayed with us to help . Finally , when it began to get dark , we gave up , driving to the nearest town to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned car were helpful : the man was a judge called Arnold Peck , his wife was a Sunday school teacher , both of them well-respected pillars of the local community -- even their two solemn , pretty little girls had a reputation for honesty -- and so the impossible tale of my father 's disappearance was treated seriously . Search parties were organized , with dogs ; a geologist was summoned from the university in Madison to advise on the possibility of hidden underground caves or sinkholes beneath the ordinary-looking ground . But no trace of my father , or what might have become of him , could be found . It 's strange , after all these years , how vividly I still recall the events of that day : the heat of the sun on the back of my neck as I plodded around that desolate field ; the smell of earth and crushed grass ; the low buzz of insects ; the particular shape and hue of the little yellow flower that my father stopped and picked before he started his endless journey ; the despairing sound of my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that none of it actually happened . My father did disappear -- but not like that . My " memory " came from a book about great unsolved mysteries , which I 'd been given as a present for my ninth birthday , just a few months before my father vanished . One of the stories in the book was about David Lang , a farmer from Gallatin , Tennessee , who disappeared while crossing a field near his house in full view of his entire family and two visiting neighbors one bright sunny day in 1880 . How long I believed I 'd seen the very same thing happen to my father , I do n't know . At least I seem to have had the good sense not to talk about it to anyone , and eventually the fantasy fell away like a scab from an old cut . But there 's another twist in this tale of unreliable memory . More than twenty years later , when I 'd gone about as deeply into the subject of mysterious disappearances as it is possible to go , I discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete fiction , probably inspired by a short story by Ambrose Bierce , but certainly with absolutely no basis in fact . It first saw light as a magazine article in 1953 , and was picked up and retold in dozens of other places . Although later researchers conclusively proved that there never was a farmer named David Lang in Gallatin , and that everything about him and his mysterious disappearance was made up out of whole cloth , the story still survives , floating around on the Internet , popping up in books dedicated to the unexplained , while other , genuine , disappearances are forgotten . Although David Lang did not exist , real people vanish every day . Let me tell you about some of them . 2 . Laura At the time , it felt more like the end , but looking back , I think this was the beginning : The body of a woman found in a South London park at the weekend has been identified as that of Linzi Slater , a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl who went missing more than a year ago . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a terrible numbness spread through me . I read the opening paragraph again , more slowly , but it was still the same . Linzi Slater was dead . The old leather office chair creaked as I leaned back , turning my eyes away from the screen . I was n't ready for the rest of the sordid details . I stared , unseeing , at the wall of books to my left and heard the sounds of life that filtered into my dusty , cluttered office from the world outside . Laughter and applause from my next-door neighbor 's television , the screech of air brakes from an HGV on the street outside , the more distant rumble and whine of a train approaching the nearby station . Life went on as usual . Of course , I had suspected for some time that Linzi was dead , but suspecting is not the same as knowing . My throat ached . I found it hard to swallow . I felt sorry for the young girl I 'd never known , sorry for her mother , and , more selfishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother . The police , it was true , had failed them , too , with less excuse . At least I could say I had tried . The police , with far more resources than I could hope to muster , had preferred to believe Linzi was in little danger . They had decided she was just another runaway . Young people go missing every day , and most of them vanish by choice . They run away from difficulties at home , or they go in pursuit of some barely understood dream . Linzi was sixteen , rebellious , moody , often truant from school . She had been seen last on a winter 's evening within half a mile of her home , leaving a corner shop where she had bought a pack of cigarettes . After that , nothing , until a few days ago , when an unlucky dog walker had stumbled across a decomposing body under a bush in Sydenham Hill Woods nature reserve . I 'd been there often myself , since a school friend had mentioned it was a favorite hangout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paths that wound past ruined houses and a disused railway cutting . I remembered the dim winter light , the smell of damp earth and leaves , the eeriness that always attaches to a place once settled and civilized , but now reclaimed by the wilderness . Reasoning that if she remained in London , Linzi might return to at least one of her old haunts , I had gone there several times . And as I 'd tramped along those shaded woodland pathways I felt I was getting to know her , that just being there was bringing me closer to her . As it turned out , I 'd been right , only not in the way I 'd imagined . I must have walked past her hidden body more than once . She might have been dead within hours of vanishing . Almost certainly there was nothing I could have done to save her by the time her mother came to me three weeks later . I read on , fearing , but needing to know how she had died . Murder ? Suicide ? An accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on a winter 's evening . It was a long walk -- more usually , a bus ride -- from Linzi 's home , a destination for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon when the sun was shining . Still , people did do things on impulse -- teenagers , especially . Had it been arranged ? Had someone asked her to meet him there , intending to kill her ? Another image came to my mind : a girl crawling through a low , hidden opening , into a cavelike space . I recalled reading about an early suicide attempt by Sylvia Plath : after leaving a note saying she was going for a long walk , she had crawled into the tiny , almost inaccessible , space beneath the house , with a bottle of pills , and huddled there , entombed , to wait for death . Had Linzi been suicidal ? Her mother had n't thought so . Janis Lettes , Linzi 's mother , was convinced Linzi had no serious problems . Sure , she was n't terribly happy at school , but there was nothing bad enough to make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close relationship , that she would have known if Linzi was depressed . As I recalled it , Mrs. Plath , too , had believed her relationship with her daughter was exceptionally close . But there would always be secrets even the most loving daughter did n't share with her mother , whether casual experiments with drugs and sex or the careful plans for her own death . I heard the bubble and hiss of the coffeemaker in the next room and thought of getting myself a cup . Instead , I forced myself to read on , anxious to know how and why the girl had died . But that was something no one knew yet . Forensic examination was under way . The next sentence shocked me . Police say they have not given up hope . Linzi was dead -- how could there still be hope ? I was soon enlightened . Despite its lead , this story was not about Linzi Slater . Not really . The great newspaper-buying public had never heard of her . Linzi 's disappearance had been a local story . It never made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some crimes did . Maybe , if she had been a couple of years younger , or prettier , with a matched set of middle-class parents , the hacks might have turned her into a cause celebre instead of ignoring her . But the press had not been interested in Linzi Slater when she vanished , and they were n't much more now . The point of this story was not that Linzi Slater 's body had been found , but that someone else 's had n't . This story was about the Nicola Crossley case . Nicola Crossley , a fourteen-year-old from Kent , had vanished two months ago on her way home from school . Her parents had not come to me , or to any other private investigator , for help : they did n't have to . The police had made finding Nicola Crossley a top priority , and the media and public had responded . Her parents had made an emotive appeal for her return on television , her last-known movements had been reconstructed on a special episode of Crimewatch , and her brother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped would lead to her return . But , so far , every hopeful new lead had come to nothing . When an early-morning dog walker in South London stumbled across the decomposing body of a young girl , every journalist in the country had thought of Nicola Crossley .
