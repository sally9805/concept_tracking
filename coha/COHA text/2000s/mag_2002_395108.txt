In a revealing new memoir , royal bodyguard Ken Wharfe opens the book on the princess 's secret loves // It was past midnight , but Princess Diana bad only one thing on her mind : gondolas . As her personal protection officer , Inspector Ken Wharfe had to fulfill such whims without compromising the princess 's security . " We did what people do in Venice-but at 12:30 at night , " he says of the 1990 outing . Then " we walked across St. Mark 's Square , dancing in the rain . " Diana , be recalls , was ecstatic . " She said , If I could have at least one of these every year , it would make everything worth living . ' It was an amazing experience . " The same could be said of Wharfe 's tenure , from 1988 to 1993 , as Diana 's chief bodyguard during the most tumultuous period of her life . Now , on the fifth anniversary of her death at age 36 in a Paris car crash , Wharfe , 54 , shares his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first by a member of her elite security force . The book provoked a swift rebuke from the royal family , with a Palace source noting that they are " shocked that a royal protection officer should betray confidences in this way . " Says Wharfe , who did not sign a confidentiality agreement : " I see this as a historical document-all the other books have been speculative . " Married to Rosemary , SS , a restaurateur in the English town of Shaftesbury , Wharfe worked his way up Scotland Yard 's ranks starting in 1966 . After leaving Diana , be continued his service with the Windsors until retiring on Aug. 9 . In this exclusive excerpt Wharfe shares his memories of Diana , from her beaujuggling imbroglios and crumbling marriage to her funeral on Sept. 6 , 1997 . No one could have failed to appreciate the bitter irony of the day . For years I had been responsible for guarding this woman-with my life , if necessary . Now I was in charge of the police security operation for my department at her funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , " says Wharfe ( with Diana , after a water ride at Thorpe Park in 1993 ) . // The paparazzi may irritate like flies , but they do n't kill . Diana 's death was senseless because it could so easily have been prevented . My department had had the care of her for some 15 years ; Mohamed Al Fayed 's team of " bodyguards " had had charge of her security for eight weeks , and now she was dead . They had failed in their task , and it angered me beyond words . Wharfe 's work for the Waleses began in 1987 , when he was put in charge of security for Princes William and Harry , then 5 and 3 . William and Harry loved to rough and tumble , and they always fought dirty . I had my own bedroom at Kensington Palace . As regular as clockwork they would knock at the door , and a small voice would say , " Ken , do you want to fight ? " One would go for my head and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head around the door of whichever room we were in and ask , " They 're not being too much bother , are they , Ken ? " " No , sir , not at all , " I would gasp . The poor man looked relieved . It was not that he was not a good father , it was just that he found the kind of horseplay his boys sometimes needed somewhat confusing . By 1988 Charles 's rekindled affair with longtime love Camilla Parker Bowles and Diana 's romance with riding instructor Capt . James Hewitt were going full throttle . Charles was no fool . He knew what was going on between Hewitt and his wife , and it seems clear now that , after years of difficult marriage , he was happy for it to continue . With James on the scene she became mellow , more contented , and , most importantly for the prince , less obsessed about his own friendship with Camilla Parker Bowles . At first , Diana preferred not to talk to me about her affair . Our journeys back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a cottage that became the scene of most of their trysts , were often tense , and I could almost feel her embarrassment . " Nothing is going on , Ken , " she would say , her face flushed red . She must have thought that I was blind , or stupid , or both . After all , creaking floorboards in an old English cottage can speak louder than the most frank confession . The malicious rumors , which still persist , about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly . The nonsense should be scotched here and now . Harry was born on Sept. 15 , 1984 . Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986 . And the red hair gossips so love to cite as " proof " is , of course , a Spencer trait . Although James Hewitt was Diana 's most significant admirer , he was by no means the only one . Since Charles had made it obvious that he did not want Diana , her adultery became inevitable .

Photograph Charles and Diana made a tense show of unity in ' ' 92 upon her father 's death . // The men whose company she sought or welcomed tended to be all of a type . They were invariably good-looking , public-school educated and from landed families , although by no means always rich themselves , but small talk seemed to be their specialty . They also had to know how to please the princess , which meant sharing her liking for risque jokes and playing adult games like Twister . She did love to care for her men , though . Any new man received the benefit of her clothes sense-and her purse . One or two had the fortune to be dressed from head to foot by her .

The princess found she enjoyed beguiling more than one man at a time . She often used the London home of Mara Berni , owner of her favorite restaurant , San Lorenzo , as a meeting place .

It delighted Diana that here her boys were able to play as normal children away from snoopers , and the restraints of royal life . Diana , too , had complete freedom . One of Diana 's many qualities was that she really was a natural girl who liked taking care of others . She delighted in doing the dishes after dinner and in washing everybody 's clothes ; she even offered to iron my shirts , though I initially declined . Eventually , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking with her that I could not imagine the Queen ironing one of my colleagues ' shirts .

In March of 1992 , with their formal separation just months away , Charles and Diana took their sons on a skiing trip to the exclusive Lech resort in the Austrian Alps . The getaway was abruptly interrupted on March 29 , when Diana 's ailing father , Lord Spencer , died in England . I assumed that on being told of Spencer 's death , Prince Charles would tell the princess , but to my surprise I was asked to see him . It was decided that as I knew Diana best , the news would be better coming from me . Charles knew that his wife would be inconsolable over her father 's death , and that he would bear the brunt of her grief and frustration . As gently as I could , I broke the news to the princess . Before long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I tentatively broached the subject of what we had to do next . She proceeded to make it clear that she wanted to return to her dead father and her family as soon as possible , and most definitely alone . " I do n't want Charles with me . He does n't love me-he loves that woman . Why should I help save his face ? " I passed on the bad news to the prince 's aide Richard Aylard . I was left in no doubt that the task of getting the princess back to Britain in a reasonable state and in company with her husband would be my responsibility . Returning to the princess 's room , I told her bluntly that this was not a matter for debate . " Ma'am , you have to go back with the prince . " At once her tears began to flow again . " Ma'am , your father was a loyal man ; he would not have wanted his death turned into a media circus , would he ?

" // I do n't know what it was that struck a chord , but something did . Her mood changed . " Okay . Tell him I 'll do it , but it is for my father , not for him . " We left Lech by car for Zurich airport the following morning . Charles sat in the backseat , next to his wife . I looked in the mirror in time to see the princess 's eyes rise heavenwards in exasperation at comments made by the prince . There was an icy silence for the rest of the two-hour journey . Oliver Hoare was a married art dealer and a friend of both Waleses ' ' . By early 1992 , writes Wharfe , Diana bad become - totally obsessed " with him . She craved him ; she needed him at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kensington Palace . The prince was away and Hoare was visiting . At around 3:30 a.m. smoke alarms sent a piercing shrill around the apartments . I ran out of my room and headed straight for the princess 's . But before I reached it , I traced the problem . There , beside the huge plant in the hallway , stood a disheveled Hoare , puffing on a cigar . Diana , who hated the smell of smoke , had obviously told him to smoke in the hallway , forgetting that this would set all the alarms off . A year after her father 's death , Diana returned to Lech-with the boys but without Charles . The princess was on an emotional seesaw throughout the holiday . She was falling out with everyone . What was to happen next showed just how close she had come to the edge . I was woken at 6 a.m. by the nightduty officer from my team . At about 5:30 a.m. , he told me , the doorbell had sounded at the front of the hotel . He went to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said " Good morning " politely , and went straight to her suite . There was only one way the princess could have gotten out-she had bloody well jumped . We were staying on the second floor of the hotel , and there was a 20-foot drop from her balcony to the ground , but that was made less by the deeply drifted snow . I went to check . When I reached the point beneath her balcony I found a perfect impression of the princess 's body in the snow . From the hole , footprints led away into the town of Lech . Some hours later , after we had said our " Good mornings , " I came to the point . " Ma'am , " I said calmly , " it 's about last night . What on earth were you thinking ? " " Ken , I just needed some air , " she said . " Yes , I did jump from the balcony . It was deep , soft snow , and I knew it would be all right . " Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to my leaving her service . As she began to break away from her former life , she began to see me as part of the Establishment against which she was rebelling . With tension in their relationship escalating , Wharfe resigned from Diana 's employ in November 1993 . Four years later he would be awakened with the news that she bad been killed in a Paris car crash . My mind would not switch off . It kept returning to the same questions : Could anything have been done to save her ? Who was to blame ? When Diana elected to refuse the Queen 's offer to keep her round-theclock Scotland Yard protection , she inadvertently set off the chain of events that led to her death . She would have been unaware that private security guards like Trevor Rees-Jones were not capable of giving her the total security blanket that Scotland Yard had done . Nor would Al Fayed , who hired Rees-Jones , have had the experience of dealing with the massed paparazzi that Diana engendered . In my opinion , they were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remember her as she was at her best , a warmhearted and fun-loving woman who , as she wished , really did make a difference .
