I But for Rhea Favonia , we might have lived with it . ' There 's a smell ! There 's a horrible smell . I 'm not going in there ! ' I did n't need to be an informer to know we were stuck . When a four-year-old girl reckons she has detected something nasty , you just give in and look for it . My little niece would not go near the bath house until we proved there was nothing horrible in the caldarium . The more we scoffed and told her the hot room was only smelly because of its new plaster , the more Rhea screamed hysterically at bath time . There was nothing visible , and the rest of us tried to ignore it . But the child 's insistence unsettled everyone . There was a faint odour . If I tried sniffing it out , I lost it . When I decided there had been nothing , straight away I smelled it again . At least Helena and I were able to go home to our own new house . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Janiculan Hill , in the home that was supposed to be their refuge from trouble , living with that other kind of trouble , Pa . My father , Geminus , and I were in the throes of a house-swap . While I tried to organise decorators to renovate his faded old lair on the bank of the Tiber , he took over the spread on which I had already worked for months , where all that remained for completion was the new bath house . The Janiculan house had a highly desirable location - if you worked on the north side of Rome . It suited Pa , with his auction house and antiques business in the Saepta Julia by the Pantheon . My own work required free access to all parts of the city . I was an informer , serving private clients whose cases could take me anywhere . However much I wanted to moveout and across the river , I needed to live close to the action . Sadly , this sensible thought had only struck Helena and me after we had bought the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flora , then died . He turned into a maudlin romantic , who hated the mansion they had shared . I had always liked the riverside quarter below the Aventine . So we organised an exchange . The bath house contractors became Father 's problem . That was appropriate because Pa had introduced them to Helena in the first place . I enjoyed waiting to see how he would persuade Gloccus and Cotta to finish , a task where even Helena had failed - despite the fact she had been paying their bills . As with all builders , the more unreliable they had become , the more extortionate those bills were . With Pa , we could n't win : by some means , he fixed them . Within a week , Gloccus and Cotta had grouted their last wobbly tile and cleared off . My father then possessed a fine domestic outbuilding with a full cold room , tepid room , three-piece sweating room suite ; natty dipping pool ; integral changing area with modish pegs and clothes bunkers ; separate furnace and log store ; de luxe Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid mosaic floor . But while people were admiring his Neptune , they also noticed the odd smell . In moments when it caught me , that reek seemed to carry hints of decay . Pa knew it too . ' It 's as if the room had been locked up with some old codger dead inside for months . ' ' Well , the room 's brand new and the old cove is still alive , unfortunately . ' I gathered Pa must have had some neglected neighbours , in the past life we never discussed . I myself knew about smells like that from other situations . Bad ones . There came an evening , after a long hot day , when we found we could no longer ignore the stink . That afternoon I had been helping Pa dig over a terrace , Jupiter knows why . He could afford gardeners and I was not one to play the dutiful son . Afterwards , we both sluiced off . It must have been the first time we bathed together since he ran away when I was seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . For a few years I even pretended not to know who he was . Now I had to tolerate occasional brushes with the old rogue , for social reasons . He was older ; he was on his own with that , but I was older too . I now had two baby daughters . I should allow them a chance to learn to despise their grandfather . As we stood in the hot room that evening , we faced decision time . During the day , I had done most of the heavy work . I was exhausted , yet I still rejected Pa 's offer to scrape a strigil down my back . I made a rough job of cleaning off the oil myself . Pa favoured a concoction of what seemed to be crushed iris roots . Incongruous . And on that hot sultry night , nowhere near strong enough to mask the other smell . ' Rhea 's right . ' I glanced down at the floor . ' Something 's rotting in your hypocaust . ' ' No , no ; trust me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some piece of Campanian fakery could be ' school of Lysippus ' , if looked at in the right light . ' I told Gloccus to omit the hypocaust from this room . His quotation was outrageous for underfloor work . I worked out some figures myself , and with that kind of area to heat , I was going to be spending four times as much on fuel . . . ' He tapered off . I eased my foot against the wide instep strap of a bath shoe . Helena 's original scheme had involved properly heating the whole warm suite . Once she admitted what she was up to here , I had seen the plans . ' What have you done then ? ' ' Just wall flues . ' ' You 'll regret it , you cheapskate . You 're on high ground . You 'll find it chilly round your rude bits in December . ' ' Give over . I work right by the Baths of Agrippa . ' Entrance was free . Pa would love that . ' I wo n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stretched slowly , trying to ease the stiffness in my lower back . ' Is the floor solid ? Or had they already dug out a hypocaust when you decided against it ? ' ' Well , the lads had made a start . I told them to floor over the cavity and block off any links to the other rooms . ' ' Brilliant , Pa . So there wo n't be an access point for crawling under this floor . ' ' No . The only way in is down . ' Nice work . We would have to break up the mosaic we had only just taken over brand new . The underfloor space in a usable hypocaust would be eighteen inches high , or two feet at most , with a mass of tile piers to support the suspended floor . It would be dark and hot . Normally they send boys in to clean them ; not that I would inflict it on a child today - to face who knew what ? I was relieved there was no formal access hatch . That saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think about this smell , Marcus ? ' my father asked , far too deferentially . ' The same as you . Your Neptune is floating on rot . And it 's not going away . ' Instinctively we breathed . We caught a definite hum . ' Oh Titan 's turds . ' ' That 's what it smells like , Pa ! ' We ordered the furnace slave to stop stoking . We told him to go to the house and keep everyone else indoors . I fetched pickaxes and crowbars , then Pa and I set about ruining the sea-god mosaic . It had cost a fortune but Gloccus and Cotta had produced their usual shoddy work . The suspended foundation for the tesserae was far too shallow . Neptune , with his wild seaweed hair and boggle-eyed attendant squids , would soon have been buckling underfoot . By tapping with a chisel , I identified a hollow area and we set to . My father got the worst of it . Always impetuous , he put his pick in too fast , hit something , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yell of disgust . I leapt back and stopped breathing . A warm updraft brought disgusting odours ; we fled towards the door . Judging by its powerful airflow , the underfloor system must never have been blocked off completely as Pa ordered . We were now in no doubt what must be down there . ' Oh pigshit ! ' Pa peeled off his tunic and hurled it into a corner , splashing water on his skin where the stinking liquid had touched him . He was hopping with disgust . ' Oh pigshit , pigshit , pigshit ! ' ' Didius Favonius speaks . Come , citizens of Rome , let us gather to admire the elegance of his oratory - ' I was trying to put off the moment when we had to go back for a look . ' Shut your lofty gob , Marcus ! It 's putrid - And it bloody well missed you ! ' ' Come on ; let 's get this over with . ' We covered our mouths and braved a look . In a depression that must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst a mass of uncleared site rubble , we had unearthed a stomach-turning relic . Still just recognisably human , it was a half-decayed corpse .
