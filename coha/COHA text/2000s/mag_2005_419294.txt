Big-game pioneers Zane Grey and Ernest Hemingway would n't have considered heading offshore to challenge marlin , tuna and swordfish without fighting chairs aboard their boats . But Grey and Hemingway were using rods as big as broomsticks , heavy linen line and reels the size of small industrial winches . They needed chairs just to support their gear . Improvements in offshore tackle since those early days have led to the chair-less style of angling now known as " standup " fishing . First developed by West Coast anglers aboard long-range head boats , stand-up tactics rely on specialized rods , large capacity reels and personal harnesses . Leverage is the key . Stand-up rods are short and stout , with notched butts that fit into a gimbal belt worn across the upper thighs . The angler grasps the rod well above the reel seat , and the relative positions of arms , body and rod allow considerable pressure to be exerted on the fish . Back-supporting kidney harnesses , with straps anchored to the reel lugs , are employed when line strength exceeds 50 pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand-up fishing offers two other benefits : mobility and sensitivity . If you 're not confined to a chair , you can quickly scoot around the cockpit when fish surge unexpectedly , which they often do . The standup style also turns boats that have no space for a chair  --  such as most center console models  --  into big-game platforms . Stand-up gear puts an angler more in tune with his or her prey , as well . The fish 's actions are transmitted directly to the angler 's body , which makes movements easier to anticipate . As the fight progresses , combination leg and hip thrusts , in concert with rapid , short-stroke pumps of the rod , keep the fish disoriented and coming towards the boat . Stand-up fights are often shorter than chair battles with comparable fish , and quicker fight times are always preferable , whether the fish goes into the cooler or back into the ocean . Stand-up fishing has its limitations , however . For example , most anglers should stay under 22 pounds of reel drag for the sake of safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tying the line to a fixed object and keeping pressure on the bowed rod for 15 minutes while squatting slightly forward with your knees bent , in a position similar to that of a downhill skier . You 'll probably end up choosing even less drag . Remember , you want to be pulling on the fish , not the other way around . And , you do n't want to go flying across the boat if the line breaks from too much drag . I typically use stand-up gear for white marlin , small blue marlin and sailfish . When fishing for giant yellowfin tuna last year off Puerto Vallarta , I took my first  --  a 330-pounder  --  from the chair to get a feel for how hard these fish pull and how much my body could endure . I switched to stand-up gear for the next fish , an 80-pounder . It was a swift and comfortable fight . Using the two different styles gave me a feel for what to expect . I 'm looking forward to my next biggame bout  --  toe to fin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive director of The Billfish Foundation , who is a professional fishing guide in Florida . STAND-UP GEAR www.braidproducts.com www.captharry.com www.finestkind.com www.izorline.com www.meltontackle.com www.offshoreangler.com www.teamnumark.com STAND-UP STRATEGIES - Stand-up rods , typically 5 1/2 to 6 feet long , should be stiff with a flexible , but not flimsy , tip . Roller guides are preferable , and butts should be aluminum or slick-coated so they slide out of rod holders easily . Make sure the rod 's fore-grip is long enough to provide adequate leverage . - The gimbal belt mount should be as wide as your upper thighs for maximum comfort . And there 's no such thing as too much padding . - Kidney harnesses should fit snugly around the hips . If they 're too low or too high , they 'll affect your balance . - Before you buy stand-up gear , hook up everything  --  rod , reel , belt and harness  --  to make sure it all fits for comfort . When evaluating fit , remember that the proper standup posture forms a 60-degree triangle . If you ca n't master that posture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find what 's right for your body . - Before you start fishing , adjust the harness straps and/or clips so you 'll be ready when the strike occurs .
