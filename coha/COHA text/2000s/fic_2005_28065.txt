Chapter One Beyond the window of my father 's shop , midwinter light skims the snow . My father stands , straightening his back . " How was school ? " he asks . " Good , " I say . He puts his sander down and reaches for his jacket on a hook . I run my hand along the surface of the table . The wood is floury with dust , but satin underneath . " You ready ? " he asks . " I 'm ready , " I say . My father and I leave his workshop in the barn and walk out into the cold . The air , dry and still , hurts my nose as I breathe . We lace up our snowshoes and bang them hard against the crust . A rust color is on the bark , and the sun is making purple shadows behind the trees . From time to time the light sends up a sheen of pocked glass . We move at a good clip , dodging pine boughs , occasionally catching a shower on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel like a dog let out to exercise at the end of the day . " The stillness of the forest is always a surprise , as if an audience had quieted for a performance . Beneath the hush I can hear the rustle of dead leaves , the snap of a twig , a brook running under a skin of ice . Beyond the woods there 's the hollow road-whine of a truck on Route 89 , the drone of a plane headed into Lebanon . We follow a path that is familiar , that will end at a stone wall near the summit . The wall , square on three sides , once bordered a farmer 's property . The house and barn are gone , and only the foundations remain . When we reach the wall , my father will sometimes sit on it and have a cigarette . I am twelve on this mid-December afternoon ( though I am thirty now ) , and I do n't know yet that puberty is just around the corner , or that the relentless narcissism of a teenage girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the last thing I 'll want to do on any given day after school . Taking a hike together is a habit my father and I have grown into . My father spends too many hours bent to his work , and I know he needs to get outside . After the table is finished , my father will put it in the front room with the other furniture he has made . Fourteen pieces in two years is n't much of an output , but he 's had to teach himself from books . What he ca n't learn from manuals , he asks a man called Sweetser down at the hardware store . My father 's furniture is simple and rudimentary , and that is fine with him . It has a decent line and a passable finish , though none of that matters . What matters is that the work keeps him busy and is unlike anything he has ever done before . A branch snaps and scratches my cheek . The sun sets . We have maybe twenty minutes left of decent light . The route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can be done in less than ten . We still have time to reach the wall . I hear the first cry then , and I think it is a cat . I stop under a canopy of pine and listen , and there it is again . A rhythmic cry , a wail . " Dad , " I say . I take a step toward the sound , but as abruptly as it began , it ends . Behind me snow falls with a muted thump onto the crust . " A cat , " my father says . We begin the steep climb up the hill . My feet feel heavy at the ends of my legs . When we reach the summit , my father will judge the light , and if there 's time he 'll sit on the stone wall and see if he can make out our house - a smidgen of yellow through the trees . " There , " he will say to me , pointing down the hill , " can you see it now ? " My father has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans are threadbare in the thighs and tinged with the rusty fur of sawdust . At best he shaves only every other day . His parka is beige , stained with spots of oil and grease and pine pitch . He cuts his hair himself , and his blue eyes are always a surprise . I follow his tracks and pride myself that I no longer have any trouble keeping up with him . Over his shoulder he tosses me a Werther 's candy , and I catch it on the fly . I pull off my mittens , tuck them under my arm , and begin to unwrap the cellophane . As I do I hear the distant thunk of a car door shutting . We listen to the sound of an engine revving . It seems to come from the direction of a motel on the northeast side of the hill . The entrance to the motel is further out of town than the road that leads to our house , and we seldom have a reason to drive by it . Still , I know it is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our walks - a low , red-shingled building that does a decent business in the ski season . I hear a third cry then - heartbreaking , beseeching , winding down to shuddering . " Hey ! " my father calls . In his snowshoes he begins to run as best he can in the direction of the cry . Every dozen steps he stops , letting the sound guide him . I follow , and the sky darkens as we go . He takes a flashlight from his pocket and switches it on . " Dad , " I say , panic rising in my chest . The beam of light jiggles on the snow as he runs . My father begins to sweep the flashlight in an arc , back and forth , side to side . The moon lifts off the horizon , a companion in our search . " Anybody there ? " he calls out . We move laterally around the base of the slope . The flashlight flickers off and my father shakes it to reconnect the batteries . It slips out of his glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , making an eerie cone of light beneath the crust . He bends to pick it up , and as he raises himself , the light catches on a patch of blue plaid through the trees . " Hello ! " he calls . The woods are silent , mocking him , as if this were a game . My father waves the flashlight back and forth . I 'm wondering if we should n't turn around and head back to the house . It 's dangerous in the woods at night ; it 's too easy to get lost . My father makes another pass with the flashlight , and then another , and it seems he has to make twenty passes before he catches again the patch of blue plaid . There 's a sleeping bag in the snow , a corner of flannel turned over at its opening . " Stay here , " my father says . I watch my father run forward in his showshoes , the way one sometimes does in dreams - unable to make the legs move fast enough . He crouches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . When he reaches the plaid flannel , he tears it open . I hear him make a sound unlike any I have ever heard before . He falls to his knees in the snow . " Dad ! " I shout , already running toward him . My arms are flailing , and it feels as though someone is pushing against my chest . My hat falls off , but I keep on clumping through the snow . I am breathing hard when I reach him , and he does n't tell me to eyes wide despite their many folds . The spiky black hair is gelled with birth matter . The baby is wrapped in a bloody towel , and its lips are blue . My father bends his cheek to the tiny mouth . I know enough not to make a sound . With one swift movement he gathers up the icy sleeping bag , presses it close to him , and stands . But the material is cheap and slippery , and he ca n't get a decent grip . I hold my arms out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sets his bundle down , unzips his jacket , and tears open his flannel shirt , the buttons popping as he goes . He unwraps the infant from the bloody towel . Six inches of something I will later learn is cord hang from the baby 's navel . My father puts the child close to his skin , holding the head upright in the palm of one hand . Without even knowing that I 've looked , I understand the infant is a girl . My father staggers to his feet . He wraps his flannel shirt and parka around the child , folding the jacket tight with his arms . He shifts his bundle to make a closed package . " Nicky , " my father says . I look up at him . " Hold on to my jacket if you need to , " he says , " but do n't let yourself get more than a foot or two behind me . " I grab the edge of his parka . " Keep your head down and watch my feet . " We move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent , and sometimes we do n't . I can see the silhouettes of trees , but not their branches . " Hang in there , " my father says , but I do n't know if it is to me or to the infant against his chest that he is speaking . We half slide , half run down the long hill , my thighs burning with the strain . My father lost the flashlight when he left the sleeping bag in the snow , and there is n't time to go back for it . We move through the trees , and the boughs scratch my face . My hair and neck are soaked from melted snow that freezes again on my forehead . From time to time I feel a rising fear : We are lost , and we wo n't get the baby out in time . She will die in my father 's arms . No , no , I tell myself , we wo n't let that happen . If we miss the house , we 'll eventually hit the highway . We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's workshop . " Dad , look , " I say . The last hundred yards seems the longest distance I have ever run in my life . I open the door and brace it for my father . We wear our snowshoes into the barn , the bamboo and gut slapping as we make our way to the wood-stove . My father sits in a chair . He opens his jacket and looks down at the tiny face . The baby 's eyes are closed , the lips still bluish . He puts the back of his hand to the mouth , and from the way he closes his eyes I can tell that she 's breathing . I unlace my snowshoes and then undo my father 's . " An ambulance wo n't make it up the hill , " my father says . Holding the child against his skin , he stands . " Come with me . " We move out the barn door , along the passageway to the house , and into the back hallway . My father takes the stairs two at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and a fan of magazines is on the bed . I hardly ever go into my father 's bedroom . He snatches up a sweater but tosses it away because of the roughness of the yarn . He gathers up a flannel shirt and realizes that it has n't yet been washed . In the corner is a blue plastic laundry basket that my father and I take to the Laundromat every week or so . Betweentimes he uses it as a kind of bureau drawer . " Hand me that , " he says , pointing . With one arm , he sweeps the magazines from the bed . I set the laundry basket on the mattress . He takes the baby out , wraps her in two clean flannel shirts , front to back , the small face above the folds . He makes a nest of sheets in the basket , and then he lays the infant gently in . " Okay then , " he says to steady himself . " Okay now . " I climb into the truck . My father sets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asks . I nod , knowing that no other answer is at all possible . My father gets into the truck and puts the key into the ignition . I know he 's praying that the engine will start . It catches the first try only half the time in winter . The engine coughs , and he coaxes it to a whine . I 'm afraid to look at the infant in the plastic basket , afraid I wo n't see the tiny puffs of breath in the frigid air , mimicking my own . My father drives as fast as he dares . I grit my teeth in the ruts . The frozen lane is ridged up from the early snows and thaws of the fall . In the spring , before the town comes by to grade it , the road will be nearly impassable . Last spring , during a two-week melt , I had to stay at my friend Jo 's house so that I could go to school . My father , who had taken great pains to be alone , finally walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to break his cabin fever . Marion , who tends the register at Remy 's , tried to bring him home in her Isuzu , but she could n't make it past the first bend . My father had to walk the rest of the distance , and his calf muscles ached for days . The baby snorts and startles me . She gives a wail , and even in the weak light from the dashboard , I can see the angry red of her skin . My father puts his hand out to touch her . " Atta girl , " he whispers in the dark . He keeps his hand lightly on the soft mound of flannel shirts . I wonder if the motion of soothing Clara is coming back to him now and hurting his chest . The road down the hill seems longer than I remembered it . I hope the baby will cry all the way to Mercy . My father guns the engine when he hits the pavement , and the truck fishtails from ice in the treads . He pushes the speedometer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mobil station and the bank and the one-room elementary school from which I graduated just the year before . I wonder if my father will stop at Remy 's and hand the baby over to Marion , who could call for an ambulance . But my father bypasses the store , because stopping will only delay what he 's already doing - delivering the infant to someone who will know what to do with her . We drive past the small village green that is used as a skating rink in winter . In the middle is a flagpole with a spotlight on it . Who left the baby in the sleeping bag ? My father turns at the sign for Mercy . The driveway to the hospital is lined with yellow lights , and I can see the baby , scrunching her face , ugly now . But I remember the eyes looking up at me in the woods - dark eyes , still and watchful . My father pulls up to Emergency and leans on the horn . The door on my side swings open , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's the horn for ? " he asks . ( Continues ... )
