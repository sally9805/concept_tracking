The chief attraction of the moon is recreation in low gravity , Which will make visitors super-athletes , Photograph // A lunar vacation is n't as far-out an adventure as you think . When Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard teed off on the moon , television viewers got more than a lunar golf lesson . Thed also caught a glimpse of the best reason we would have for revisiting our celestial neighbor . Forget about building deepspace telescopes , mining helium-3 for fusion reactors or any of the other practical reasons for establishing a lunar colony . Earthlings just want to have fun , and there is no place here that can math the excitement " out there . " Just getting there would be a kick in the pants as you blasted off on the adventure of a lifetime . Once on the moon , which exerts only one-sixth the gravitational tug of the Earth , you could break the high jump ; broad jump and pole vault records without breaking a sweat . While you ca n't book a lunar getaway today , the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Encouraged by the growing popularity of the extreme adventure craze-climbing Mount Everest , teasing killer sharks from inside steel cages , that sort of thing-space entrepreneurs took a poll to learn if they could sell un-Earthly vacations . An astounding eight out of 10 Americans under age 40 said they would go . And , one in 10 would dig deep into their pockets , paying as much as a year 's salary for a ticket . Sensing the launch of a new growth industry , Rochester Institute of Technology in New York and George Washington University in Washington , D.C. ; have set up programs to train future space tourism experts . Students at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles can learn the fine points of building lunar habitations from world-renowned space architect Madhu Thangavelu . Exotic though their specialties may be , these graduates will probably get to work in their fields . Two major hotel chains and a major Japanese construction company have announced plans for fixed and flying lunar hotels . " Right now we 're on the edge of the technological knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space , there will be a realization that the realms out there are not the exclusive property of NASA , " says David P. Gump . As the president of LunaCorp of Arlington , Va. , ( www.lunacorp.com ) which was founded in 1989 , he is one of the founding fathers of the space tourism trade . Gump sees lunar tourism following the same trajectory as travel to exotic locations here on Earth . " At first it was only the movie stars who could fly a DC-3 from coast to coast . Then airline travel became a mass market . " For its part , LunaCorp is building the 21st century equivalent of the 3D viewers that brought the wonders of the Wild West into the parlor and awoke a wanderlust in 19th century imaginations . Being built in cooperation with the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pa. , the LunaCorp Icebreaker is a wheeled robot that will allow Earthbound travelers to steer a high-tech moon buggy over the dusty lunar soil . X-Prize To Orbit The vicarious thrills provided by a ride on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon 's south pole in late 2003 , could be just the icebreaker the space tourism industry needs to get its plans off the drawing board . " People really do want to get into space , " says Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin , who is also a LunaCorp adviser . " But they are prevented by the cost . " Depending upon whether you fly on a Chinese rocket or NASA space shuttle , the price ranges from about $2000 to $10,000 a pound to reach orbit . The consensus is that it will need to come down to below $100 before serious space tourism can begin . Rockets that take tourists from the Earth to the moon are n't likely to have NASA nameplates . Except for encouraging rhetoric , the space agency has written off lunar exploration and support for space tourism . Instead , the road back to the moon is being driven by an unusual competition that hearkens back to the early days of aviation , when the impossible dream was to fly an airplane across the Atlantic Ocean . In the true spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up shop in the city that Lucky Lindy made famous and raised $10 million in prize money for a modest ut essential first step to the moon . To claim the old , a privately funded organizaion must fly three eople to an altitude f 62 miles . Then , and this is the hard part , it must make a second trip within two weeks . So far , 16 teams are officially in the running . " Humans do their most creative and best work when they 're competing , " says competition founder and chairman Peter Diamandis . " The X-Prize is looking to heat things up again by introducing a constructive type of competition amongst the top rocket scientists and entrepreneurs from around the world . " Photograph The raw material for orbiting and lunar hotels might be space orbiting and currently discarded might be space shuttle fuel tanks , which are currently discarded and burn up on re-entry. // Entrepreneurs have their eyes on the X-Prize because of the unusual economics of space tourism . The costs of travel on Earth are pretty much proportional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive 100 miles as 50 . A ticket from New York to Hong Kong is more expensive than a ticket to Detroit . In space travel , most of the costs are " front loaded " into the first seconds after liftoff , when the rocket gobbles most of its fuel , literally kicking you into space . Liftoffs will be a fast and furious thrill , but from the perspective of tour operators , not exactly a money machine . Since staying in space costs only a tiny fraction of what it costs to get into space , the profits in space tourism will be made on long trips . And longer trips will require more than a spacesuit and a place to sit . Industry experts say that experiences with SkyLab and Mir have solved these problems . " The idea of living comfortably and safely in space is quickly becoming a reality , " says Gene Meyers , president of Space Island Group ( SIG ) of Los Angeles . " Given the availability of proven technology , it 's no longer a matter of how , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior design for an Earth-orbiting hotel . Meyers envisions a space resort constructed from the empty external fuel tanks of NASA space shuttles . Assembled like a giant Ferris wheel , the resort will rotate very slowly , about once a minute . This will simulate one-third to one-half the gravity experienced on Earth . Dining , entertainment and living quarters will be located along the outer section of the ring . " We 've taken the space resort concept to the next level by giving the public the opportunity to see just how livable space can be , " says Meyers . Successful Las Vegas hotel owner Robert Bigelow sees a flaw in Earth-orbiting hotels that can be summarized in one word : boring . His solution is a more interesting orbit , one that would take tourists around the moon . The owner of Budget Suites of America , Bigelow has formed a new company , Bigelow Aerospace , to advance his idea . He tells PoPULAR MECHANICS that he plans to invest a half billion dollars in technologies needed to develop an orbiting hotel that would shuttle between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earthto-moon hotel to be a half-mile long . It would slowly rotate to simulate about 40 percent of the gravity here on Earth . A staff of 50 could be welcoming its first flight of 100 guests aboard in about 15 years . The exact departure date will depend upon the availability of a lowcost launch vehicle , perhaps a design encouraged by the X-Prize . Lunar Luxury A hotel that circles the moon will be a prelude to a hotel on the moon . Peter Inston , a British architect who has designed hotels for the Hilton chain , has proposed a sprawling 5000-room domed structure . It would be powered by the sun and receive its water supply-hotels use lots of water-from lunar ice that may exist in polar regions . Former NASA engineer Gregory Bennett , who now runs Bigelow Aerospace , worked out plans earlier in his career for pressurized clear plastic walkways so tourists could venture onto the lunar surface .

Shimizu , a Japanese construction firm , says it has invested $3 million in plans for luxury lunar condominiums . " We look forward to lively competition in the coming profession of commercial space architecture , " says Space Island 's Meyers . " It 's a field crying out for new leaders-and are they going to get famous .
