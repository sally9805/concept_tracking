TRANSITOLOGY AND THE NEED FOR NEW THEORY <p> A vigorous polemic has been conducted over the last decade concerning the usefulness of employing in Central and Eastern Europe the model of transitions to and consolidations of democracy fashioned out of the Southern European ( Greece , Portugal , Spain ) and Latin American experiences. 1 Some scholars of the latter regions have taken to calling themselves " transitologists " and " consolidologists " and have put forth sometimes exaggerated and self-important claims to have invented entirely new areas of the discipline . The study of the transitions to and consolidation of democracy is fascinating and important , but since its theory and empirical material are still weak and underdeveloped , it ought at this stage to be considered merely a new , significant , interesting , but perhaps also topical subject matter , like " liberation theology " or " **29;1227;TOOLONG , " rather than a major theoretical breakthrough . <p> Meanwhile , students of Eastern and Central Europe have often been put on the defensive in this debate . They have been branded as narrow " area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretical interest and insights and therefore out of the mainstream of comparative politics . It is true that within East/Central European studies there are some narrow area specialists who are not interested in large , comparative studies ; but for the most part this is an unfair , demagogic , and misleading charge . <p> The question is not whether East/Central European scholars are also theoretically oriented comparativists but rather which body or insights of theory are the most appropriate ones to use . Why should we assume a priori , before the evidence is even collected or the East/ Central European experience carefully weighed and considered , that Southern Europe and Latin America have much to teach students of East/Central Europe ? Actually , there is much that the East/Central European scholar can learn from the Southern European and Latin American experiences , as to both what is relevant to their own studies and what is not . At the same time we need to recognize that the Eastern/Central Europe experience is so fundamentally different from those of Southern Europe and Latin America that the theory and categories developed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited usefulness . We need to sort out which insights from studying Southern Europe and Latin America are useful and which are less so ; certainly no wholesale , mindless application of the transitology/ consolidology literature to East/Central Europe is appropriate . <p> But I wish to take another tack here . So far the debate among East/Central European scholars has been over whether the literature developed by students of Southern Europe/Latin America is relevant for this area . Students of East/Central Europe have largely assumed that the transitologists and consolidologists got the Southern European/Latin American experiences right . I wish , however , to suggest that the model developed by transitologists and consolidologists is fundamentally flawed even as interpretation of Southern Europe and Latin America-in other words , that the transitology/ consolidology scholars got it wrong ( or much of it ) even for their own area . And , of course , if this literature is wrong or , more accurately , incomplete even on Southern Europe ( let us leave Latin America out of the discussion for now ; that area is so far removed from East/ Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its utility as a model for East/Central Europe is extremely limited ) , then it certainly can not be of great usefulness for East/Central Europe . <p> Obviously , this is a big subject area and a controversial one , certain to generate even more polemic . I can not in this brief research note answer all the questions or provide all the data and references to support the case completely . But let me present some of the main themes and arguments as a way of opening the debate . Southern Europeanists and Latin Americanists , East/Central Europeanists , and students of comparative politics are all likely to learn something from the discussion . THE IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL CULTURE <p> Much of the literature on Southern European transitions pays insufficient attention to political culture-the values , beliefs , and orientation that undergird political behavior-and is even , one suspects on political or even ideological grounds , hostile to the concept . Instead , the literature on Southern Europe emphasizes institutional changes ( political parties , elections , interest groups , elites , government actors ) almost exclusively . Geography and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , no longer " matter . " 2 <p> This seems to me a patently ridiculous statement . Of course geography and political culture count , very much so , although we may differ over precisely how much . Anyone who doubts the importance of geography and political culture in understanding either Southern or East/Central Europe either has n't spent any time in the area , did n't understand what he or she saw , or else is so ideologically opposed to political culture-based explanations that the ideology has blinded him or her to reality . <p> I would briefly make three argumentative points with regard to political culture in Southern and East/Central Europe . First , there is a distinctively Southern European or Mediterranean political culture common to the area , and one for each of the countries within the region ; this political culture has changed enormously over the last forty years and , as a rich literature now suggests , is one of the key factors in understanding the Greek , Portuguese , and Spanish transitions. 3 Second , within East/ Central Europe there is an at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by country , region , and/or ethnic group , similarly changing over time . But such enormous differences exist between Christian , Orthodox , and Muslim groups and/or countries that this explanation alone , encompassing aspects of geography , religion , ethnicity , sociology , history , and culturally influenced levels of socioeconomic development , enables us , almost single-handedly ( but of course in combination with other factors ) , to differentiate those countries that are " making it " in East/Central Europe ( developed , democratic , integrated or soon to be into NATO and the EU ) and those that are not. 4 And third , although there are interesting similarities between aspects of political culture in both areas of Europe ( a thousand or more years of Christianity , for example ) , there are essential differences ( as between Catholicism and Orthodoxy , for example ) that need to be studied seriously , as well . <p> In Eastern Europe the history , the geographic location between East and West , the repeated foreign invasions , the ethnic makeup , the social and religious base , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fundamentally different from those of Southern Europe , and we need to take those differences into account as we examine the transitions to democracy in the two areas . CHANGES WITHIN THE PRIOR REGIME <p> Much of the literature on the Southern European transitions ignores the important changes that occurred under the previous regime , especially in its later years of that regime . This is not just a plea for an understanding of what is now called " path-dependency " - whether Spain or Czechoslovakia , for example , had a prior democratic experience that facilitated their later transitions to democracy . Rather , it is a summons to examine closely the changes under way in the prior authoritarian or Marxist-Leninist regimes , to analyze trends that shaped both the later process of democratization and the kind of democracy that emerged . Here I focus particularly on the Salazar-Caetano regime in Portugal prior to its overthrow in 1974 and the Franco regime in Spain prior to Franco 's death in 1975-especially Spain , since it is frequently used as the paradigm case in the transitology literature . <p> The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners of our earlier models , such as fascism , totalitarianism , Marxism-Leninism , or Juan Linz 's famous distinction between authoritarianism and totalitarianism , 5 that we tend to reify them , thinking of them as rigid or static categories . They are useful as simplifying devices but inadequate as full explanations because they ignore the changes occurring even within those frameworks . Let us use Spain for illustration . First , beginning in the late 1950s Spain began a process of economic reform and growth ( second in the world only to Japan 's ) that over almost two decades stimulated industrialization , created jobs , reduced poverty and historic underdevelopment , and began to propel Spain into the modern world . Second , those economic changes helped give rise to mammoth social changes-urbanization , rising literacy , a larger industrial working class , large numbers of women in the work force , a new middle class , an emerging business/entrepreneurial class often distinct from the historical elite families-that not only helped provide a sociological base for later democracy but also made Spanish society far more advanced and differentiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Third , these changes in turn gave rise to vast cultural changes in family structure , the role of women , relations between the sexes , the role of religion ( greatly reduced in influence ) , behavior , and attitudes , even while France was still alive . For example , even though Franco 's censorship was still in effect , smart journalists and editors learned that they could push the boundaries of openness to new degrees provided they refrained from attacking Franco personally or the armed forces . And although " dirty " movies and literature were still prohibited by the official censorship , Spanish tour companies offered regular weekend bus excursions to Perpignan ( groups so large as to constitute bus caravans ) across the border in France , where Spaniards could watch or get anything they wanted . Nor should the impact of tourism-upwards of forty million tourists were coming to Spain yearly by the early 1970s-and all those Germans and Scandinavians cavorting topless or bottomless or both on Spanish beaches be underestimated as a force also changing Spanish culture and behavioral norms. 7 <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defy our usual stereotypes ( " fascist , " " authoritarian " ) about the system . First , even though opposition political parties were still illegal in both Spain and Portugal . in both countries opposition " study groups " were functioning that operated much like political parties and served as the nuclei for the open democratic parties that later emerged . Second , within the government there were already known and publicly discussed liberal and conservative factions that provided some still-limited public policy debate and that also served as nuclei for later political groupings and parties . Third , the 1930s-style corporatist system , often linked in the literature with regime authoritarianism , was in the process of being shunted aside , ignored , or transformed and was beginning to assume the functions of a more modern government social welfare system. 8 <p> An illustration from my own research experiences in Spain during the Franco regime helps illustrate a number of these points . One day , residents of Madrid were treated to newspaper headlines proclaiming , " There Are No Strikes in Astrias " ( a traditional coal-mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) -a sure sign , as any adept reader of Spain 's newspapers knew , that there were strikes in Astrias . A few days later a similar banner headline would read , " There Is No Violence in Astrias " -a sure sign that there was violence perpetrated by the police , the strikers , or likely both . A few days later new headlines would blare , " The Government is Not Negotiating With the Illegal Strikers " -a sure sign that a far more pragmatic government was negotiating , even with the " underground " communist unions ( comisiones obreros ) , while ignoring its own official corporatist sindicatos , and that it had to negotiate seriously if it wished to avoid disruptive strikes that would undermine the miracle economic growth rate now so necessary for continued prosperity and stability . <p> None of this is to suggest that the Franco and Salazar/Caetano regimes had transformed suddenly into paragons of democracy , pragmatism , and liberalism . But it is to suggest that they were far more open , pragmatic , and changing than the static models ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them would suggest . Indeed I would be prepared to argue that by early 1974 ( just before the transition ) , Spain and Portugal were so fundamentally transformed , economically , socially , culturally , even politically , that when the actual transition came in the mid-1970s , it was a comparatively easy process . All that was required was a modest push ( the death of Franco , a military coup d ' tat in Portugal ) and the entire edifice of the old regime , which our models led us mistakenly to assume was impenetrable , toppled almost literally overnight . The institutions of democracy were subsequently relatively easy to construct ( hence the institutional focus of the transitology literature ) because so many other basic systems ( economic , social , cultural , political ) had already been transformed . In contrast , East/Central Europe , which had also been undergoing changes , albeit more limited ones , in the 1970s and 1980s , had not yet experienced such a deep and thoroughgoing transformation , still had many of its basic systems in place from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portugal , and Spain , have to undergo a thorough economic , social , cultural-behavioral , political-institutional , and international transformation all at once and quickly rather than taking them more or less gradually and sequentially as had Southern Europe . THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF MARKETS , FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS , AND A BUSINESS/ENTREPRENEURIAL SECTOR <p> Of all the differences between Southern Europe and Russia , Eastern Europe , and Central Europe , perhaps the most important was the presence of pre-existing markets , financial institutions , and a business/entrepreneurial sector in Southern Europe , and their almost complete absence in the others . As transitologists have focused on political institutions , they have all but completely ignored this fundamental economic difference . When I first went to Russia in 1992 , one year after the fall of the communist regime , I found that in the city of Nizhny Novgorod , a major industrial center on the Volga River and Russia 's third largest city , with a population of three million , there was not a single bank , a single financial institution , a single ATM machine , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VISA or American Express cards or that had fax machines or out-of-country long distance service . <p> Spain and Portugal had largely closed , autarkic , corporatist , and " mercantilist " or statist economic systems until the mid-1950s . But even within a general context of autarky , there were functioning markets , banks , and financial institutions , a nascent business/entrepreneurial class , and an economic and communications system open to international trade and the outside world . By the 1960s and 1970s , although some elements of autarky remained , both Spain and Portugal had opened their markets and allowed supply and demand ( rather than the state ) to set most prices and wage rates ; both had well-established banks and financial institutions that had entered into partnerships with big , highly capitalistic international banks , and both had a booming business/entrepreneurial sector . All of these continued to expand rapidly from the mid-1970s , but the point is how developed , how open , how market- and internationally oriented the Iberian economies were even before the democratic transition. 9 <p> All this stands in marked contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Poland 's agriculture never completely socialized , that Czechoslovakia ( as it was then constituted ) had an entrepreneurial element willing to sell almost anything ( including , especially , weaponry ) to anyone , and that Hungary 's economy also was never completely socialized and had a certain orientation toward capitalist buying and selling . But even if 5 or 10 or maybe 15 percent of those economies was not socialized and had some still quite limited markets operating within them , East/Central Europe was a very long way from the predominately market-driven economies of Southern Europe , with their growing prosperity and mushrooming financial institutions , already closely integrated ( but not yet formally in the EEC ) into the dynamic , prosperous countries of Western Europe . The presence of growing markets , banks , financial institutions , and a business class , even in nascent form , in Greece . Spain , and Portugal before the mid-1970s may well be the most fundamental difference between them and Eastern Europe , and it may be the most understudied of all the differences . PACTS AND OTHER MILESTONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , has focused mainly , at times almost exclusively , on the political institutions emerging during the transitions . But that emphasis may reflect the fact , first , that Southern Europe 's underlying economic , social , cultural , even psychological transitions , unlike those of East/Central Europe , had already occurred by the mid-1970s and were even completed in a sense ; and , second , that the political transition , the only one remaining , was the easiest to accomplish , precisely because these other harder and longer-term transitions had already occurred and formed an indispensable cultural and socioeconomic base for the political or democratic transition . <p> A second requirement is that we disaggregate the Southern European " model . " In most analyses Spain is taken as a paradigm case while Greece and Portugal are often conveniently neglected . But Spain may be such a special case ( it was increasingly prosperous , middle class , etc. ) that its experience is not even faintly replicable in East/Central Europe . Portugal , after all , experienced in the mid-1970s not a happy , peaceful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and such fragmentation and disintegration that it took approximately a decade for the economy to recover ( with massive outside economic assistance ) and the political system to stabilize . Greece also transitioned to a kind of democracy in 1974 , but its political system remained so heavily dominated by patronage , clientelism , and outright corruption that it was seldom presented as an attractive model for East/Central Europe-although for some Countries it may well be a more accurate and realistic one . In other words , Spain 's peaceful , gradual , reformist ( reforma as distinct from ruptura in Portugal ) route may be entirely unrealistic for the East . <p> Spain 's political-institutional development after the mid-1970s has been portrayed in such orderly and sequential terms that it appears antiseptic , almost formulaic : the break by Adolfo Surez with the old regime , the political reform to allow greater freedom , the re-emergence and legalization of political parties including those of the left , the " social pact " involving business , labor , and the state , the first democratic election in 1977 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers Party until its electoral victory in 1982 . It sounds so neat that it seems almost preordained . But I remember it at the time , in Spain as well as Portugal , as considerably more disorganized than that , marked by great fears of possible revolution , civil war , a right-wing coup , a communist takeover , national disintegration , a reversion to fascism-the possibilities or " systems outcomes " seemed incredibly broad and not pre-ordained-and with democracy by no means assured . Only after the fact does the democratic outcome seem clear , even " inevitable " in the literature . So to the extent that the transition-to-democracy literature seeks to provide a roadmap , a formula , it both distorts the actual Spanish experience ( remember , Spain was the most successful of the Southern European countries and certainly not representative ) and presents a false and even formulaic model that East/Central Europe , with its quite different history , sociology , and less-developed economic infrastructure at the time the transition began , could not possibly emulate . THE **26;1258;TOOLONG DISTINCTION <p> For a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics literature between totalitarianism and its more limited , " softer , " less-developed form , authoritarianism. 10 Greece , Portugal , and Spain were considered authoritarian regimes whereas the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and the Soviet Union and its " satellites " were seen as totalitarian . <p> But then the Soviet Union and some of the Eastern European countries opened up somewhat , allowed somewhat greater freedom or liberalism , and seemed to be becoming more pluralist. 11 As those trends continued or occurred-on and off-the label " authoritarian " began to be used to describe and analyze the Soviet Union and East European countries . as well as Southern Europe . Certainly by the 1970s the Soviet Union and some countries of Eastern Europe were no longer totalitarian in the old Stalinist sense , but how much they had " liberalized " was open to considerable debate . <p> I now believe , having traveled extensively in Russia and East/Central Europe , as well as having earlier done research in Southern Europe , that the labels used were misleading . Although the Stalinist model of totalitarianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than previously , the leap to the " authoritarian " designation was premature . It put the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the same category as Greece , Portugal , and Spain-not an accurate rendition . It likely exaggerated the changes that had occurred in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe . It probably provided unrealistic expectations for an easy and rapid transition to genuine freedom , pluralism , and democracy . For even through the regimes of Franco and Salazar/Caetano were not exactly freedom-loving or democratic , for those who lived in them Spain and Portugal were considerably freer and more pluralistic , their institutions and civil society more developed and more open , than were the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe . And that is another reason why Spain and Portugal were able to make the transition to democracy much more easily and more rapidly than the Soviet Union or much of Eastern Europe . " Post-Stalinist " or " post-totalitarian , " with its characteristics spelled out , might have been an appropriate label and analytic model to apply to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent it equated political conditions in the East with those in the South , was both inaccurate and misleading , and it led to overoptimistic expectations for the ease and rapidity of democratic transitions in Russia and East/Central Europe . UNDERESTIMATION OF INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE <p> The early literature on transitions to democracy , which recent analysis has only partly corrected , woefully underestimated the role of international influences in both the process and outcome of democratization. 12 In part , this bias likely reflects lack of knowledge about the policy involvement of outside actors ; in part also , one suspects , it reflects a preference on nationalistic or political grounds to give the credit for democratization to internal , domestic forces . The outside actors , many of whom carried out their efforts through covert operations , would also prefer not to emphasize their earlier interventionist role . <p> The facts are at odds with this hands-off interpretation . In the 1970s , the German Social Democrats , the Swedish Social Democrats , the French Socialists , the British Labour Party , the Socialist International , and the U.S. Embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all involved in a massive , multi-pronged effort to keep Portugal from " going communist , " to stabilize it , and to ultimately produce a democratic outcome . The amount of foreign aid , coming after 1986 in the form of EU subsidies , was enormous , helping to transform Portugal from the poorest country in Europe to one of the most successful : stable , middle class , democratic , and a significant voice in the European Union . The Portuguese bailout , almost wholly unstudied in the literature , may , along with the Marshall Plan , have been one of the great foreign aid success stories of the twentieth century . <p> In Latin America , it was the presence and effort of the United States , and only secondarily those of Europe , that were critical . In Central America the United States engineered elections to provide a democratic middle ground between rightist militarists and leftist guerrillas , reformed the armed forces , bought off and/or defeated the guerrillas , and continued to play a quasi-proconsular role in shaping political outcomes . In South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less heavy-handed than in the small , weak , underinstitutionalized states of the Caribbean and Central America , but it was important nonetheless , often critical behind the scenes . The United States pushed and cajoled , offering inducements as well as advice and pressure even while allowing and encouraging domestic forces to take credit for the successes , and certainly it should not be ignored or minimized in any analysis of democratization processes . <p> Spain was closer to the South American model than to Portuguese or Central American interventionism and proconsularism . The United States and the European allies were hovering at every step of the process , but they were not often overtly intrusive. 13 Let us of course give credit to the Spanish forces and leadership in the transition , even accord them overwhelmingly the major credit ; but once again we also need to acknowledge the roles , both overt and covert , of Austria , Germany , Sweden , Great Britain , France , Socialist International , and the United States in the process . Because Spain 's transition , unlike Portugal 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , Spain learned from Portugal 's mistakes ) , it called forth a less interventionist policy on the part of the outside actors ; but we should have no doubt that if Spain , like Portugal , had broken down into chaos with the threat of a communist putsch , the United States and the Western allies would have been prepared to act more forcefully . <p> Russia and Eastern Europe are also complicated cases . We know that during the 1980s the United States and others strongly supported the Solidarity movement in Poland , assisted non-governmental organizations and civil society groups throughout Eastern Europe to find political space for their activities , aided dissidents and opposition voices in the media to find outlets for their expressions , assisted East European governments in developing greater autonomy from the Soviet Union , and strongly encouraged ( and gave a push to ) the breakup of the Warsaw Pact . In addition , by this point a host of semiprivate international agencies , including in the United States the National Endowment for Democracy , the national Republican and Democratic international affairs institutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist democratization efforts while also serving American foreign policy goals . In the Soviet Union it is probably accurate to say that the main forces destabilizing the regime were internal : economic backwardness and mismanagement , technological retardation , bureaucratic ossification , political and moral bankruptcy , maybe even alcoholism . But certainly by applying its military , technological ( including its challenge to the Soviets to compete in the development of missile defense ) , economic , political , and moral ( human rights ) pressures , the United States exacerbated the tensions and cleavages already present in Soviet society and hastened the downfall of an already deteriorating regime . And during the actual collapse ( 1989-91 ) of the Soviet Union and afterward in its efforts to build democracy , the U.S. and European influences were , it hardly needs saying , omnipresent. 14 <p> Understand that in this analysis I am not just talking about " ripple effects , " " waves , " and " demonstration effects " of democratization from one country to the next . Those I accept as given , and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about direct , overt or covert intervention by outside actors in promoting their interests-in this case stability through democratization-in the internal affairs of other nations . Yet the scholarly literature has been exceedingly reluctant to acknowledge this fact . Why ? Only two answers are possible . The first is ignorance-a possible but unlikely explanation given what is known even publicly about these events . The second is a purposeful decision to give all the credit to the domestic forces and thereby deny it to the international actors , perhaps as a political decision not to acknowledge the role of the United States and of a particular administration in power at the time . CONCLUSION <p> Beyond the arguments that I have presented here , there are numerous other problems with the transitology approach as it derives from the Southern European and Latin American experiences and seeks to find relevance beyond these boundaries . My list of its flaws , problems , biases , and oversights is illustrative but not exhaustive . The point has been made , however . <p> The dispute between the transitologists and the East/Central European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The so-called transitologists have faulted the area specialists for not using a comparative , more broadly theoretical approach . But what they seem really to have in mind is obliging the East/Central Europeanists to use their particular approach and model . <p> Everyone ( well , almost everyone ) in the comparative politics field , including most East/Central European specialists , understands that there is always a dynamic interaction between comparative theory and individual case or empirical studies . Cases and area studies have often been the bases of comparative theory ( witness dependency theory , corporatism , state-society relations , others ) ; at the same time , when we use theory to understand new political phenomena or areas ( in this case East and Central Europe ) , we need also to be prepared to adjust the theory to fit the new research terrain and the new facts discovered . The scientific method in comparative politics means that we do not reify our conceptual frameworks : instead , we adjust , change , or even discard our theories as new facts come in . We emphatically do not adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of the utility of transitology and consolidology theory in East/Central Europe , two issues are in dispute . The first , exemplified by the Bunce-Schmitter/Karl debate , is whether that body of theoretical literature derived principally from the experiences of Southern Europe ( and even more narrowly the Spanish case ) is relevant for East/Central Europe . The consensus of specialists in the area is that it is not , that at best it has only limited usefulness , that the East/Central European experience is so different from that of Southern Europe , to say nothing of Latin America , that the model developed out of the latter two is only of modest assistance in helping us understand the former. 15 And that of course is all that such models are useful for ; they are aids to understanding but certainly not holy writ . <p> In this research note , however , I have raised an even more fundamental point . I have argued that not only is the **26;1286;TOOLONG model of limited use for comprehending East/Central Europe but that much of it is also fundamentally flawed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means that we need to return to the sources , to examine the **26;1314;TOOLONG model itself , to reconstruct our basic understanding of democratic transitions in the light of new facts and interpretations . East/Central Europeanists ought now , on the basis of their research findings , to be at the forefront of reconstructing the new model as much as Southern Europeanists . <p> I recently had an interview with one of Czech president Vaclav Havel 's principal lieutenants . He told me that as they were plotting their political strategy in those fateful days of 1989 , they had open before them the well-known O'Donnell , Schmitter , and Whitehead book Transitions from Authoritarianism ( note , no mention of democracy in the title ) and were looking there for guidance , a formula for what to do next . " Oh , poor fellows , " I commented , " you 're lucky you made it to democracy at all . " He responded , " Yes , we did not find what we were looking for there ; we had to make our own way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Salazar/Caetano regimes were far more open , pragmatic , and changing than the static model we apply to them would suggest . <p> During the collapse of the Soviet Union and in its efforts to build democracy , U.S. and European influences were omnipresent . <p>
