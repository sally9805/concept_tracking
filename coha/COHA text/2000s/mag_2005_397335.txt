Section : Priority TRENDS NEWS , IDEAS , AND TRENDS IN BRIEF Consumers and politicians love them , but state sales tax holidays are becoming a major headache for businesses <p> IT ALL STARTED in New York at Macy 's . In 1997 , in an effort to spur consumer spending , Gov . George E. Pataki put his signature on a novel law : For a week in January , the state would suspend its 4% sales tax on most purchases of clothing and shoes . At a kickoff shopping trip at the famous department store , the governor boasted that the measure would " put more than $20 million in the pocketbooks and wallets of New Yorkers " <p> Ever since then , a growing number of states  --  especially those with high sales taxes  --  have followed New York 's lead , declaring sales tax holidays that often coincide with back-to-school or Christmas shopping . George W. Bush signed one into law in 1999 when he was governor of Texas . His brother Jeb created a holiday in Florida in 1998 . In all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the District of Columbia , will hold tax holidays this year , and two states plan to add them in 2006 . <p> THEY SHOP , YOU DROP Shoppers at the Century 21 department store in New York City enjoy a back-to-school sales tax holiday . <p> But if consumers jump at the chance to shave a little off the $200 billion a year they pay in general sales taxes , some critics are now saying that the state holidays are good for consumers but have no effect on the economy  --  and actually hurt retail businesses . For example , although retail sales will rise during the week of a tax holiday , the net economic impact may be limited because retail sales often fall in the weeks preceding a tax holiday . <p> And whether or not tax holidays boost the economy , they certainly wreak havoc in other ways . The administrative issues of figuring out what should and should n't be taxed can be a nightmare . For companies that do business in multiple states , the patchwork of rules makes tax accounting complicated , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse or discourage investors because they can create financial reporting discrepancies that make it hard to judge retailers on same-store sales comparisons from one month to another . " Sales tax holidays make the tax code unstable , " says Curtis Dubay , an economist at the Tax Foundation , a nonpartisan tax policy research group based in Washington , D.C. " You are essentially operating under two tax codes for the year , so it is difficult to comply . " <p> Still , there 's one thing on which pretty much everyone now agrees : Tax holidays are here to stay because consumers and politicians love them . " It is awfully hard to speak out against something that appears to be cutting taxes , " says John Mikesell , a professor of public finance and policy analysis at Indiana University , " even when it does n't make much sense . " Belts Without Buckles <p> To understand how much trouble sales tax holidays can cause businesses , it helps to understand just how complex sales taxes are to begin with . The difficulties start with the sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own rules , but so , too , do many cities , counties , municipalities , and transportation districts within those states . Across the country , there are roughly 7,500 sales tax jurisdictions , creating an estimated 70,000 possible sales tax combinations . If Pataki were to shop at Macy 's today , for example , he would typically pay 8.375% in sales taxes ( 4% for the state , another 4% for the city , and the final 0.375% for the metro transit district ) . <p> Not only do the states set their own rates , they often differ on what product categories should be covered by a sales tax , and what specific items belong in those categories . To take one ludicrous and oft-cited example , a Twix bar may be considered food , which is not taxed , or candy , which is . " The retailers are dealing with a complex nightmare right now , " says Steve Kranz , tax counsel at the Council on State Taxation , a trade group in Washington , D.C. , that represents 600 businesses on state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the position of having done the job incorrectly and getting audited and paying tax out of pocket for not collecting enough , or of collecting too much and being sued by consumer groups in class-action litigations . " <p> In that environment , the tax holidays  --  by making exceptions for a day or a week in a certain jurisdiction for certain items  --  just add one more layer of complexity . Consider a handful of Twix-like rules from this year 's crop of tax holidays . In Iowa , clothing under $100 is exempt from tax , but belts without buckles are still taxed . In New York state , the tax-free spending limit is $110 , but localities can choose to opt in or opt out of the holiday entirely . In North Carolina , textbooks and reference books get the tax break , but novels do not . And in Texas , clothes and shoes get the break , unless they 're used for sports . <p> Five years ago , looking to clean up this mess , revenue officials from a number of states joined forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The policymakers originally hoped to get tax holidays off the books completely , says Diane Hardt , Wisconsin 's tax administrator and co-chair of the project , but they were rebuffed by legislators . So now , Hardt and her allies seek to simplify sales tax issues , including problems created by the holidays , in other ways . <p> This fall , 19 states will adopt standard sales tax definitions on matters such as what constitutes school supplies , and rules on issues ranging from time zones ( it 's the seller 's that matters ) to goods put on layaway . Ironically , Hardt was not able to get legislators in Madison to sign on . Still , she and other tax policy experts hope that the voluntary move the states are taking will spur a congressionally mandated fix  --  although they know that such a solution , if it happens , wo n't come quickly . Closed for Business <p> In the meantime , how complex a problem you 've got depends on how many  --  and which  --  states you do business in . Large multi-state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Vertex to get them through the tax holidays . But for smaller retailers , these customizable applications are often priced out of reach . Indeed , the vast majority of the nation 's roughly four million retailers rely on cash registers , Excel spreadsheets , and calculators to figure out their taxes . <p> Of those that do use software , the most popular solution , in use by 37,000 of firms , is the point-of-sale version of Intuit 's QuickBooks software , which rolled out in 2002 , and which tracks tax rates and holidays ( along with a slew of other inventory-management issues ) at a cost of $1,500 per checkout station . " We 're trying to help retailers track sales , and sales tax is part of that " says Steven Aldrich , who heads up Intuit 's retail solutions group . " But this is not the top-of-mind priority for most retailers because it is only certain types of retailers and not every day of the year . " <p> That , of course , is the problem with holidays : Changing the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes accounting much more difficult . Take the case of Kevin Lundeen , co-owner of Flying Fingers , a yam and knitting store in Irvington , N.Y. , that does over $1 million in sales a year . " During these tax holidays , the state will say , ' You do n't have to charge tax on yarns and buttons , but you do on knitting needles ' " he grouses . <p> Lundeen found that accounting for the past few years was so tricky , even with Intuit 's software , that this year he threw up his arms in disgust . Flying Fingers simply closed for business during the sales tax holiday . That 's probably not the outcome legislators had in mind . Where the Sales Tax Goes on Holiday <p> Eleven states and the District of Columbia hold sales tax holidays . Nineteen states are working together to minimize the side effects of such holidays . And a few states are doing both . To Tax or Not to Tax ? <p> The rules governing state sales tax holidays can be mind-numbing . FOOTWEAR IN TEXAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they are used for sports . <p> YES NO BOOKS IN NORTH CAROLINA <p> Reference books are not taxed , but novels are . <p> YES NO BELTS IN IOWA <p> Belts with buckles are not taxed , but belts without buckles are . <p> YES NO <p> By Amy Feldman <p> <p> Amy Feldman can be reached at amy@amyfeldman.com <p>
