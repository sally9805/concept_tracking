" What is it that one gets from a session at a craft school ? Technical information surely . But even more than that , a sense of expanded personal possibility . Basic needs are taken care of . Food happens . There is a place to sleep and minimal contact with telephones and automobiles . There is nature . Nonessentials are pared away . For a few weeks one can part the waters of everyday reality and stand on the dry land of a dream . It is a powerful and empowering experience .

The gate incorporates memorabilia , demonstration pieces and other detritus from Penland 's original iron studio and additional objects . // The Penland School of Crafts originated 75 years ago to teach weaving . Industrial goods had by then penetrated even remote places like Penland 's mountainous , hardscrabble corner of North Carolina , and traditional skills were being left behind . Local families welcomed the training and the cash earned from selling their handiwork . Weaving is still taught there , but as part of an array of fiber arts . And the curriculum long ago expanded to include other pursuits . Penland has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of media , attracting students of all ages from everywhere . Still , the school itself might be thought of as a loom-for weaving connections . Penland is also enmeshed in its surrounding region in ways that were never envisioned in 1929 . And it has always been entwined with , and sometimes stretched , approaches to arts education and the very definitions of art and craft . In an anniversary observance February 27 to March 5 , one of a number of events to mark the /5th , 100 artists who have taught at Penland since the 19605 returned for a studio retreat . The gathering , which I attended , made palpable the webs of community and creativity that have spun outward from the rustic campus , which overlooks a panorama of meadows and forested ridges in the Blue Ridge Mountains . Some traveled far ; others were alumni who have settled nearby . ( There are more than 100 studios within 15 miles of the school , about half operated byartists with Penland roots ; slightly further afield - around the sophisticated little city of Asheville , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional craftspeople who teach occasionally , while others are faculty in academic art departments . They personify a promise that has always been at Penland 's heart : that it is possible , and good , to build a life centered on the making and teaching of craft . The thousands who have studied and taught at Penland and those who have gone on to staff university programs bear this out .

" Sculpture of branches and saplings by Patrick Dougherty installed outside the Penland dining hall , // Penland 's founding , by a young teacher named Lucy Morgan , took place in the context of a loose " missionary " movementthat - combining religious altruism and political progressivism aimed to uplift the people ofthe southern Appalachians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means : schools and cooperatives provided places to train and work , then marketed the products to summer tourists or at church-run shops in the North . ( The John C. Campbell Folk School , Arrowmont School of Arts &; Crafts and Berea College are other surviving institulions with similar origins . ) Within a few years of its founding , Penland added classes in carding , spinning , dyeing , basketry , caning , pottery and leatherwork . But even as the focus remained on traditional skills , innovation was embraced . Early weaving classes , for instance , used a then new lightweight loom designed in Sweden and reproduced by local woodworkers . And while Morgan extolled the spiritual value of craftingthe beautiful object , the need to appeal to a market kept forms from being stagnant , sentimental ( one might even say anthropological ) artifacts of mountain culture . Morgan herself was depicted-in two images on the coverof a 1954 pamphlet called " Practical Weaving Suggestions " - wearing modish dresses .

Individual objects pictured are in the exhibition " The Nature of Craft and the Penland Experience . " // Morgan 's successor and Penland 's next most influential figure was Bill Brown , who became director in 1962 . Brown , with an M.FA from Cranbrook Academy of Art , had been assistant director at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts . Penland 's approach to learning grows directly from the Haystack model he imported from Maine . Students immerse themselves in a single studio ; teachers are drawn from a broad pool of professional artists and educators . Under Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haystack , and the mountain traditions receded . ( There are still more loops and braids : Haystack itself , founded in 1950 , had been inspired by Penland . ) By 1983 , when Brown retired , Penland 's curriculum was movingtoward today 's subject areas : books and paper , clay , drawingand painting , glass , iron , metals , photography , printmaking , textiles and wood . ( In one- and two-week sessions from the end of May to early September , the school offers a range of instruction-and a diverse professional faculty-within these subjects . ) And the school had become firmly established in the worlds of art and art education . The founding meetings of both the Southern Highland Craft Guild ( 1930 ) and the Glass Art Society ( 1971 ) had taken place there ; alumni had threaded themselves practically everywhere art was being taught , made and exhibited . " If you had on your resume that you had taught at Penland , galleries , dealers and curators paid attention , " says the glass artist Henry Halem , who participated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Penland was playinga contributing role by the late 19605 . " And within our own community , it 's a badge of honor . " No quaint work emanates from Penland 's studios today . But what Jean McLaughlin , the current director , calls " the throughlines " to Penland 's past still matter . To the ceramic artist Michael Sherrill , there 's power in knowing that the place itself has been steeped in " reverence for the maker of the object . " The school 's seclusion enhances the feeling that its purpose is to stimulate expression . Amazingly , the long vista from the campus remains unsullied not a road to be seen , or a house or even a distant light at night . ( But there 's trouble in paradise - plans for a housing development on a facing mountainside . ) " With the pristine view and sense of security , fear drops . You get a community of trust , " says fiber artist Ted Hallman , noting that studios stay open and typically busy late into the night . The glass artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from knowing how intensely others are focusing on many kinds of work . " There 's a common language celebrating creativity , and a generosity of heart . Fine art and the mountain tradition are not in tension ; openness and acceptance come from those mountain roots , " Stankard says . " Penland has a more expansive community than othercraft schools , " observes the jeweler Arline Fisch , professor emeritus at San Diego State University . Besides students at every level of skill who take summer workshops , there is a constant presence of people dedicating their lives fully to art , ensured by Penland programs like the eight-week spring and fall " concentrations , " the slots for full-time " core students " and the coveted artist residencies . The sense of community at Penland also results from having so many craft professionals nearby , some of whom , says Fisch , " have had a direct influence on the school 's programming . That community exists all the time , both inside Penland and out ; it 's largerthan the school . " As well , Penland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art classes it provides for the county 's public schools . And 14,000 visitors stop at Penland 's gallery/welcome center every year ; many tour the campus , and many more take a map of area studios and galleries to visit . Penland 's skeins of connection continue to spread .
