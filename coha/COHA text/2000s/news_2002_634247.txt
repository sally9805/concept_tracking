<p> Florida and Arizona do n't have to worry about Chicago easing them out as prime retirement destinations , but they should heed some warning signs . <p> Local builders are reporting that a few former Chicagoans are selling homes in the warmer climes to return to northern Illinois . And , the rebounding retirees are n't lonely for Chicago weather . <p> " We have people at Carillon North and Carillon Lakes who have come back from Florida or Arizona , " explained Richard J. Brown , CEO of Cambridge Homes . " They did n't want to be that far from their children and grandchildren . " <p> The " 55-plus " market is getting a lot of attention these days . New developments are springing up all over the area offering buyers , with various degrees of seniority , single-family homes , condominiums and apartments . <p> Cambridge pioneered the " active adult community " concept , in the area in the mid-1990s , when it took over a failed project near Plainfield and turned it into Cambridge-at-Carillon . <p> The development caught the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their 50s . The concept was to provide low-maintenance homes in a secure , country-club atmosphere , with bountiful social and recreational activities . At least one member of the couple buying there must be 55 years old or older . <p> The original Carillon spawned Carillon North in Grayslake ; Carillon Lakes in Crest Hill and Forest Glen in Carol Stream . <p> " The main part of the market is people who do n't want to move off to some other climate and leave their friends and family , " Brown said . " The kids have grown . They live by themselves . It gives them a whole new lease on life . " <p> A big community center for exercise , entertainment , arts and crafts and education is part of the mix . <p> " The secret is not just to have them available , " Brown said , " but to have a recreation director , something like a cruise director on a ship , to keep everything going . " <p> Forest Glen , in Carol Stream , is an age-restricted town-house complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The 2- and 3-story town houses , some with elevators , start at about $209,000 to $271,000 . The wooded site borders Wheaton and the Glen Oaks Health Center . <p> " It 's turning out to be popular , " Brown said . " Not on the scale of the others , but people are interested in it . " <p> Del Webb Corp. , the patriarch of senior developments , brought its winning Sun City formula to Huntley in 1998 . It marked the company 's first foray outside of the sunshine states , such as Arizona , Nevada and California . <p> It has expanded its presence even further by teaming up with one of the area 's top mainstream builders , Lakewood Homes , for Grand Haven , an adult " resort " development in Romeoville . <p> The collaboration calls for 677 town houses and single-family homes , starting at about $150,000 to $174,000 for the town houses and $164,000 to $204,000 for the houses . <p> A 15,000-square-foot community center will have billiards and pool tables , a ballroom , library , kitchen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming pools , as well as tennis and basketball courts and walking and bike paths . <p> A professional staff coordinates activities and special interests . <p> The retirees want to stay close to friends and family , and they usually want to keep community ties , also , according to Ron Rydin , site manager for the Residences of RiverWoods condominiums in Melrose Park . <p> " I would say that 80 percent come from single-family homes , " Rydin said . " They are coming from Melrose Park , River Forest , Oak Park , Norridge and the border area of Chicago . They have lived there anywhere from 15 to 40 years . " <p> The building will have 120 condominiums , with 1 to 3 bedrooms , full kitchens , parking and private balconies or terraces . Prices start at $158,000 to $425,000 . <p> The building includes a rooftop fitness center and is in a landscaped , gated " senior campus , " that will have an assisted-care facility and a senior citizen apartment complex . <p> Windsor Development Corp . discovered that a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is the Village Green of McHenry and the Village Green of Elgin . <p> Both offer condominiums , starting in the $140,000s , plus housekeeping and some meals for a monthly fee . Health care is provided by Provena Senior Services . <p> " We felt that it was a market left untapped , " explained Wendy Mustard , vice president for sales and marketing for Windsor . " We felt there were people left between retirement and the Del Webb-type area . <p> " They do n't need a nursing home or assisted-living facility , but they like the comfort of knowing they can get meals and have a bus to go to the grocery store . " <p> The majority of the residents are retired , she said . About one-third of buyers are couples . <p> There are the usual activities and amenities , she said , but the residents own their units , which are 1- or 2-bedroom condos , with complete kitchens and large baths . <p> Some new developments , or sections of them , are aimed at the " empty-nester " or over-55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These are like Devonshire at Kipling Estates in Shorewood , being built by Kipling Homes . <p> There , couples can " live in a single-family home with no grass cutting , bush trimming or snow shoveling , and not have to give up the custom living space they are used to having in a previous home , " explained Kathy McCauley-Dames , Kipling 's vice president of sales and marketing . <p> Ranch designs are featured and range from about $169,900 to $196,900 . The 2- and 3-bedroom plans have 1,248 to 1,819 square feet of space . <p> The buyers have access to the Kipling Estates amenities , such as the clubhouse , pool , tennis courts , ponds and lakes and practice golf range . <p> Shorewood also is the home of the new Timbers of Shorewood , a retirement development , which will have apartments for independent living and those requiring assisted care . <p> One building wing will have 96 1- and 2-bedroom apartments , with rents starting at $1,700 a month , including two daily meals , security , housekeeping and activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,550 a month , for three daily meals , laundry and housekeeping and around-the-clock assistance . <p> A growing market <p> The aging of America is changing the way some new homes and condominiums are being built .
