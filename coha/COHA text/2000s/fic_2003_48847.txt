SOME MORNINGS , ZAY WAKES UP to the unblinking sunlight of a California morning , uncertain where she is . The bedclothes , the dust on the dresser , the nightstand with the clock radio , the lamp , the box of tissues too precisely held up for view are made strange by virtue of their clarity . Twenty-five , no , nearly thirty years have passed-is it possible-yet her vision is still measured by the window of that one apartment in Portland and the narrow sidewalk-level window of their underground apartment : rain-streaked , blurred by water and footsteps , as soft-focused as memory . So much time , so little time . How can she be the same person ? <p> How can she not ? <p> Her husband , an oral surgeon who leaves early for his daily regimen of root canals , extractions , and jaw realignments , is gone . He , who has not gained a pound in thirty years , backs his BMW out of their garage promptly each morning at six . Their daughters live in other states with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves for college in a month , has chosen to sleep until the time of his departure . She faces her dislocation alone . Usually this sense of foreignness lasts a moment only , the time it takes for her to turn on the radio and hear some announcer gabbling the news , but this morning instead of the constancy of their unchanging weather or the slide in tech stocks , there are too many voices , events that she can not comprehend , and when , after selecting another station , she hears " Dome epais , " the duet from Lakme , her equilibrium is sent reeling : the mattress tips , and the world seems to have turned upside down . But it is not until after she has run the laundry and vacuumed the living room and finds herself standing in front of her son 's room , her-knuckles to the painted wood of his door , the only waking human creature in a house with six bedrooms , that the mooring of clock and calendar threatens to come undone . <p> It was another time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Perls , " Zay called from the hallway , " is everything all right ? " She knocked on the older woman 's door , softly at first , then more loudly , until she was using the side of her hand rather than the knuckles . As though she were the police , she thought , the goon squad . The pigs , as Richard would call them , in that pugnacious way he had of trying so hard to be up-to-date , a short man , a young man older than his age whose impulses are fiery but five years too late . A quality as endearing as it was embarrassing . <p> She tried again : " Mrs. Perls , can you hear me ? " <p> No response . Except from down the hall , where she felt-rather than heard-a door open quietly , then just as quietly close again . Mrs. Dolby no doubt , the hallway gossip , blabbermouth , and scold . Who could silence any conversation by her mere presence . Once she got going , it was impossible to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you I heard , Mrs. Perls ? " She turned the knob ; the door was unlocked and opened easily , too easily , and Zay took one uneasy step inside , shivering , pulling her caftan more tightly around herself as a gust of damp , freezing air spilled into the hallway . " Mrs. Perls ? It 's me , Zay , your neighbor . You know , number one-oh-six . " <p> For the past three months , she and Richard had lived across the hallway from Mrs. Perls . As manager of the building , she lived in the largest apartment-two full rooms plus a bathroom , with a window overlooking the traffic on Front Avenue . Other than when she made her infrequent forays down the hall , Mrs. Perls kept to herself . Each week when Zay paid their rent , the older woman , opening the door only as wide as the safety chain allowed , took the check with fingers that bore more resemblance to the talons of some sort of exotic bird ; Zay would catch a glimpse of long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's harsh voice , and then the whiff of a body long unbathed , that odor competing with a gust of some pungent , expensive lotion-Youth Dew , she thought , too strong even for Chanel-before the door was shut in her face , punctuated by the sound of at least three , maybe four , locks latching , bolting , hooking shut again . <p> Although she had occasionally thought that they might have some things in common , she had never harbored the illusion that she and Mrs. Perls would become great friends . They would , for instance , never drop in on each other for a cup of coffee and a few minutes of gossip . Nothing like her mother and her mother 's canasta cronies . The women who traded romance novels with each other , their true currency . Zay had never supposed that she and Richard would have stayed here this long in the first place either , and nothing could have prepared her for her first full look at the interior of Mrs. Perls 's apartment . One entire wall of the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lined with Styrofoam heads adorned by wigs in various styles and shades of red . The other wall was covered by signed and framed celebrity photographs . Bob Hope . Fred Astaire . The center of the wall was dominated by six different photographs of Frank Sinatra . A kind of shrine . Unreal . Icons of her parents ' generation , each with his arm around a smiling , more youthful , black-and-white incarnation of Mrs. Perls . Something of a compensation . That a woman like Mrs. Perls could have had her moment once upon a time , no matter what she looked like now . <p> Various stories circulated about the manager , and Mrs. Dolby was happy to share them : Mrs. Perls had been a Vegas showgirl in the ' 40s . She 'd been a gun moll in the Chicago mafia . She had run a speakeasy . A brothel . She had entertained President Kennedy . What difference did it make ? She was living in the Hill Villa now , along with the rest of the pensioners and ne'er-do-wells . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraping against the label . Old Blue Eyes singing Christmas tunes . In February . Jesus . Enough is enough . Zay lifted the arm and set it on the cradle . <p> " Mrs. Perls ? " she called again . " I 'm not trying to pry , but I was in the hallway , and I thought I heard a noise . " <p> Signs of recent habitation were spread like a trail of bread crumbs . A dirty bowl and spoon stood on the drain board while the faucet dripped into an unwashed saucepan . The smell of oatmeal . <p> " Mrs. Perls ? " <p> She pushed past the batik curtain that hung in the doorway between the living room and bedroom . The window was wide open , and sleet drummed the bureau beneath it , upon which several porcelain figurines had been posed . A ballerina on point . A hunter and his retriever . A girl staring into a mirror . Precious German kitsch . All coated with a layer of ice . Down on Front Avenue , a bus roared past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake . Which was when Zay turned from the window and saw Mrs. Perls , asleep , it seemed , in her bed , except that she was lying on top of the blankets , her housecoat untied , her pillow across her face . <p> " Oh , " Zay said . " Oh , Jesus . " <p> The old woman had flung one arm across her end table , and a ceramic lamp had smashed into pieces on the floor . There was her noise . And next to the white puffy hand , four pill bottles , the lids off and emptied . Codeine , Demoral , morphine tablets , Percodan . Jesus , Jesus . A smorgasbord of painkillers , a buffet of death . Zay touched the cold hand for a pulse and , after flipping the sides of Mrs. Perls 's housecoat across her belly to hide the sagging skin and the patch of gray pubic hair , pulled the pillow away from her face . The mask of her final moments . She had not gone easily . <p> Zay was still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of silent surprise on her face . A repressed scream . <p> " She 's dead , " Zay said . " I took my shower , and I heard a noise , and when I opened the door , there she was . " <p> Mrs. Dolby began to back away . She made a sound in the back of her throat as though she were choking . <p> " Oh , no , no , " Zay said , remembering the pillow still clutched in her hand . " It was n't like that , " she said , her free hand pointing to the nightstand as evidence . " It was n't like that at all . She overdosed . I guess the pillow was ... I do n't know . To keep it dark ? " <p> The older woman stopped her retreat , her curiosity gaining the upper hand , and together they looked at the building manager 's body in its last position on the bed : at the mound of her belly beneath the housecoat , at the puckered skin around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The henna-tinted mop of a wig crumpled on the mattress next to her perfectly bald head . <p> That fall , when there were gas lines an hour long , and heating oil was at a premium , and the word Watergate was just becoming familiar , everything else in her life had fallen apart as well . With Geoffrey deferring to his father 's lawyers , Zay and Richard had moved in together , into the apartment house on the edge of downtown . Richard could not stop apologizing about the arrangements-one room on the basement side of the building , a two-burner gas stove behind a stained folding screen , the bathroom down the hall . Until he met Zay , his rented room in the attic of an old house had been suitable for someone so rarely at home . <p> " It looks like we 've hit bottom now , " he said . " Literally and figuratively . From the heights to the depths . " Doubt had made his baritone unsteady . " I could n't find anything else , though , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can move in right now , if you want . We can always look for something else later . " He shook his head in resignation while Zay turned a slow , uneasy circle in the center of the room , taking in the radiator hanging from the ceiling , the plaster crumbling around the pipes . The window with its view of a cement retaining wall . The layers of Congoleum that , in their wildly different colors and patterns and styles , presented themselves like an archaeologist 's dream . <p> Remembering her parents , their descriptions of early travails , Zay had endeavored a tone of cheerfulness , good humor ; she said that an apartment like this would be a memory in the making , something that in twenty years they would remember with fondness . They were starting out together , after all , and a little slice of poverty would n't hurt them , not when they 'd been through so much already . It could only bring them closer together . She 'd had enough of entitlement . <p> Richard had exhaled loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagging mattress in its unpainted metal frame . But she really was n't so sure , was she ? No . No . No . And if she were honest with herself , not even when she declared it a love nest fit for Juliet . She wondered how much of her certainty had been forced upon her by Richard 's doubt , her role as the positive one , the more experienced one . The one who-if she were honest with herself-had forced these changes upon them all . After all , she had to admit this as well , for all his faults and insecurities Geoffrey had never asked her to live like this . <p> So how could she have said anything different ? There was Richard , still wearing his lab coat , his uniform as a student in dental school , his shoulders already rounded from bending over molds and X-rays , then bending over the mouths of charity patients who , according to Richard , never bathed , much less brushed or flossed . Even in those days when they were first together , guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already set in motion , his first act after coming back to his attic in the evening-before a kiss , before a hi-how  --  was-your-day-was to wash his face and hands with an antibacterial soap , never mind that he had done that before leaving school ; he needed to put enough distance between the poverty of his own bad teeth and those whose mouths with their decay and neglect were symbolic of deeper disorders . His stuffiness and rigidity about such matters worried her . So different from what she had first imagined , and how different from their first rush toward one another ! At Zay 's urging he had grown a beard , but its sparse , erratic growth only made him look younger rather than more tolerant , a yeshiva student , perhaps , or a boy playing with a Halloween disguise . She would have ruffled his hair , if she were n't warned by his look of seriousness . Of purpose . And before she could make any such mistake , there was a knock on the door : their door , she had realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the place or not ? " <p> " We 'll move in today if that 's all right . " Richard held up the key . " We can get a second copy , ca n't we ? " <p> At the entrance of the manager , Zay had turned away as though to inspect the refrigerator with its tiny freezer choked by frost , the pool of brown liquid in the bin labeled " meat " ; her first glimpse of Mrs. Perls had been little more than a head of flaming red hair and a cigarette dangling between those elaborate nails . <p> " Sure . Any hardware store . I got a passkey , but I do n't keep duplicates , so if you lose it , you lose it . Do n't come to me crying . " <p> Richard put the key in his pocket and ushered Mrs. Perls back into the hallway , offering his assurance of their fitness as tenants . The murmur of their voices reached Zay from far away , as waves heard from a cottage of childhood . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main by people who slept through most of it , and it suddenly struck her that this was indeed a waking moment : I live here , she had thought , in this place , with my lover . I have thrown away my marriage for a basement apartment . And our landlady is an old harridan with a call girl 's nails and the smeared lipstick of a floozy . <p> Her mother was right . One day you wake up and think , How in the world did I get here ? <p> " Harridan , " she had said , savoring the word . She sat down at the table underneath the narrow set of ground-level windows , examining in the half-light her own nails , which , during periods of turmoil , she had never been able to refrain from biting . Footsteps echoed just above her head . A pair of jeans and work boots , someone wrestling the garbage cans out of the alley . A waterfall of bottles cascaded into the city truck idling in the street in front of the building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The roar of the truck backing up , retreating from the end of their dead-end street . Richard opening their door sheepishly . Like a husband . <p> " Honey , " he had said , " I 'm home . " <p> The police stayed in Mrs. Perls 's apartment for two hours or more , taking pictures and measurements , even after the ambulance arrived , sliding on the steep , icy streets . Mrs. Perls left the building in a body bag , her exit aided by two city employees who guided the gurney up the stairs to the entrance of the building , after which two police officers-a uniformed woman and an older man in plainclothes-sealed off the doorway with yellow tape . Withdrawing a spiral notepad from his overcoat , the older detective , gray-haired and gray-faced , signaled Mrs. Dolby to follow him down the hall while the woman turned to face Zay . <p> " You live here ? " She was one of those women who carry their weight above narrow hips and long , thin legs ; a barrel chest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting Zay in mind of the Michelin tire advertisements . The policewoman , the recipient of a badly timed permanent , signs of which were still evident in the burn mark just below her hairline , folded her arms across her ample chest . " Across the hallway , I mean , from the deceased ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Officer Perry . " The woman held out her badge , a gesture undermined by the small , square hand behind the badge , a hand surprisingly small and shapely . A recent manicure . " Mind if I come in , ask a few questions ? " <p> " I have to go to work . I 'm already an hour late . " <p> " I 'll just be a sec . I 'll give you my card . Your boss can call me if need be . " <p> Zay let the policewoman precede her into the apartment . <p> " I 'll need your name , " the policewoman said . " You know , as a witness . " <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a moment of whimsy , her mother had named her for a breeze . But Zephyr was not a name that anyone was liable to say and Z. sounded too cold , too much like unconsciousness or sleep . So Zay it was . At different points in her life , she had nearly changed her name just as she had recently changed her life . If the right impulse were to present itself she might yet become Linda , perhaps , or Gale-another breeze ! - or Charlotte or Della or Yvonne . Heavens . But she had to admit that she felt more like Zay than any of these others , and Zay she was likely to stay . <p> " Interesting , " the policewoman said , although it was clear she was n't . " Are you married ? " <p> So then she had to explain her separation . The divorce that was imminent . One more personal question and she would be inviting Officer Perry to dinner . <p> " You were the first one to find the body . " <p> " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . I just moved the pillow . It was on top of her face . " Zay stepped behind the folding screen with the clothes she had laid out on the bed what seemed like an eternity before . " I 'm making some tea . Would you like some ? " <p> " No , I 'm fine , thanks . So , how did you happen to be in Mrs. Perls 's apartment ? " <p> " I was coming down the hall from the shower , and I heard this noise , so I went in . " Zay filled the teapot then lit one of the burners . She shrugged into her bra and panties , skirt and blouse while waiting for the water to boil . " I ca n't even tell you what the noise was for sure . The lamp , I guess . When I tried the door , it was open , which was strange , because it was always locked . There must be half a dozen locks on the door , in case you have n't noticed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolby must have heard me , and that 's when we called . I called . End of story . " <p> " About that cup of tea . Maybe I 'll change my mind . If that 's okay with you . " <p> " Sure . " Zay pushed the screen together and set it to one side . " Will you call my boss ? " <p> " I 'll call your boss . Give me the name and number . I 'll call your boss from the squad car . I 'll turn the siren on if she does n't believe me . " <p> Officer Perry scratched her head with the top of her pen . " Let me tell you , never let your sister-in-law experiment with your hair . But then , you do n't look like the type . Go back a bit , will you ? What happened during the hour or so before you found Mrs. Perls ? " <p> " No , nothing . I took my shower . The power went off once , right in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great , I 'll be finishing up in the dark . ' The window in the bathroom 's been painted over , you see , so it 's like a tomb in there when the lights go off , which only happens when it rains , meaning they only go off like twice a day . But they came back on almost immediately . I got out , went down the hall , and that 's when I heard something from Mrs. Perls 's apartment . " <p> " That 's it ? " Officer Perry sounded somewhat disappointed , as though she had expected some previously undisclosed revelation . <p> " That 's it . Sorry . " <p> If the detective really cared to know , she and Richard had been arguing . About stupid stuff . Laundry , breakfast , you name it . Not dish  --  breaking , insult-hurling argument , but the quiet , snarling , morning  --  after variety : " So , do you think we might have underwear by tonight ? " Richard left while Zay was pulling her caftan over her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was in the darkness of fabric , surrounded by the odor of her own body , when she heard the door close , and she was alone . Younger than she by three years and less experienced in the skirmishes of domestic life , he had discovered escape to be his most effective weapon . She had turned on their garage sale Philco to the public radio station and listened while the high , unearthly tones of " Come epais " rose toward her ceiling . A braid of twin spirits . Then , after padding down the dark hallway in her socks and that filthy caftan , she had taken her shower at the end of the hall , in the chipped , clawfoot tub with its patched-together hose and nozzle , the ripped plastic curtain , all the while thinking about the passive-aggressive aspects of Richard 's character and how infuriating it was-that his absence could pose as much turmoil as his presence . Especially since she knew the argument was really about her meeting Geoffrey for lunch the day before . He could be so tiresome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch that had nothing to do with the marriage but everything to do with the divorce . Which she and Richard had prompted in the first place . <p> Three months after their breakup , Zay could not entirely understand that Geoffrey was no longer her husband in anything but the technical sense . When she saw him in the booth at Lubek 's , hunched over , smoking a cigarette , his eyes underlined by shadow , she barely resisted the old impulse to put one hand on his cheek , bring his head down to her breast , the old habits pulled so strongly , to mother this boy who was five years her senior , the pattern of their marriage . Full of his usual woe and remorse , he had called Dr. Browning 's office , where she worked as receptionist and general factotum . Called at 11:30 , just in time for lunch . <p> " I was n't going to call you , but then I called you , " was his explanation . <p> " And here I am , just like always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows under his eyes to bear fully upon her , " not quite like always . " <p> " Why ? Are you buying ? " <p> When they had been married , Geoffrey had rarely been awake for lunch or ready with the money to purchase it . A member of an experimental theatrical troupe , Geoffrey was rarely home before three in the morning . He insisted that the group-although without a stage , a script , or financial backing and unlikely ever to have any one of the three-was on the verge of a major artistic breakthrough , but Zay believed any breakthrough was likely to be more cathartic for the actors-so selfinvolved were they-than for any potential audience . There were Lisa 's revelations regarding her father 's abuse of herself and her two sisters . Or Virgil 's confession of his attraction to other men , a confession more shocking to Virgil than it had been to anyone else . On such revelatory occasions , Geoffrey had come home , waking Zay to news that could have waited for a later hour of the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that overbearing , overindulgent patriarch , from whose hand flowed fifty-dollar bills , the source of their marriage 's last month 's rent . The month before as well , come to think of it . In the wake of the separation , if there was any one person whom Zay was most sorry about disappointing , it was Geoffrey 's father , whose reference and connections were responsible for Zay 's position as Dr. Browning 's receptionist and whose irony at Geoffrey 's expense had always come to Zay 's credit . She had once written a thank-you note and from that time forward she could do no wrong . The last Zay had heard , the theater group had disbanded-there was , finally , a point after which one could know too much about others-and Geoffrey 's father was demanding his thirtythree-year-old son get a job . To be about his father 's business . <p> Richard was another story altogether . The ambitious son of working-class parents without Geoffrey 's sense of entitlement . A dental school student in his last year and one of Dr. Browning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fever of 105 , sweating and delirious . A staph infection picked up from the clinic and left untreated . She had told him that it was irresponsible , waiting so long to come in . " Who are you , to be talking about irresponsible ? " he had said , looking at the red silk blouse she had debated about wearing that morning . A Christmas present from Geoffrey 's parents . " I do n't have the time to be sick . Much less the money . " <p> Dark-haired , dark-eyed , nervously thin , burning with fever and plans . How different he was from Geoffrey 's blond , well-fed , indistinct good looks ! Even his teeth were wild , snagged and crooked , a walking advertisement for the need of his own services . He leaned into her window and stared down her blouse without bothering to disguise his desire . She imagined his body a kind of humming transmitter , set to a frequency she might receive . <p> She had looked up his phone number the next morning and , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day he was feeling better . " I 'm feeling better now , " he said . " How about this afternoon ? " <p> They both had known why she had called , and they made love that first day in Richard 's attic room in Richard 's bed with its squealing springs and loose-limbed metal frame . Buttons scattered onto his floor when he tore at her blouse . She bit his shoulder , he pinned her wrists . He was still sweating from fever , his eyes were red-rimmed and bloodshot , and his lovemaking was as furious and angry as it was quickly finished . <p> " What kind of game is this ? " he had said afterwards , grabbing her finger with its wedding band , twisting it so she whimpered . " I do n't know why you 're here . " <p> And her only response was to be angry as well : " How should I know ? Maybe I just wanted a poor boy . Someone to exploit . Someone with lousy teeth . " <p> She had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to be truthful to herself , she had known-the moment she had entered Richard 's attic-that her life with Geoffrey was over . Geoffrey had stretched her loyalty too far . No matter how Richard responded . She had intended only the momentary encounter , she had n't counted on anything beyond an afternoon , she had n't expected Richard 's sense of responsibility , so novel in her experience with men , his underclass quest for a middle-class life and all its values . Her life thus far had consisted of a series of impulses : she had studied art in college because she had liked the cover of the art history text ; she had married Geoffrey because when they first met , the sun had been behind him and the tips of his hair had glowed ; and now there was Richard , whose temper and energy and ambition seemed an answer to the lethargy and aimlessness that had grown over her like moss over a rock during the previous three years . <p> Now , Geoffrey shifted forward in his seat . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes , Geoffrey 's going to start begging . Come back , Zay , oh please , oh please , oh . ' I 'm not going to do that . I have a little more pride than that . " <p> " I never thought any such thing , " Zay said , though frankly the dread of such a scene had nearly kept her away . Even as it had been the source of some fascination . But , now that it was not to occur , she could n't help but feel a twinge of disappointment . " Give me a little credit . Give yourself some credit . " <p> " I just wanted to let you know that I 'm seeing someone , so as far as a divorce is concerned , I 'd just as soon make it a quick one . " <p> What was this ? <p> " Look , right before the group busted up , Anne and I got together . If you want to know the truth , we had a little thing going even before you left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little embarrassed , and I did n't want you to think I was just trying to one-up you . " <p> Anne Berquist , that little ferret ? Who , along with her shrewd , close  --  set eyes and tiny , pinched face , had the most enormous breasts for a girl so short and sparing otherwise . <p> " You 're not serious . " <p> " Dad 's pissed , " Geoffrey said . " He 's still mad about you leaving . He hates Anne , by the way , no surprise there . Which does n't make me unhappy either . " <p> He and Anne were planning to get married once she finished her degree . A June wedding . And Geoffrey was interviewing for positions with various companies , all in sales . It was amazing , he said , how many places thought that an actor was exactly the sort of person they needed to push a product . Insurance , real estate , pharmaceuticals , you name it . He had even interviewed with a yacht dealership . Yachts ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he refused to look her in the eye . <p> " So , I ca n't be bitter anymore , " Geoffrey said . " I do n't have it in me . How 's your dentist ? " <p> Zay spent the remainder of her lunch hour fighting the sense of being blinded , as if she were sitting by a window in full view of an afternoon sun so bright that sight was blotted out . What had she done ? To all appearances , Geoffrey was happy and no longer in need of her help . He had Anne for that now . He did n't need Zay any longer . That 's what he had called to tell her . That this was the outcome of her grand , impulsive passion : to free him for his own . To free him for his life . To give her back a legitimacy she had never wanted . And this was what Richard was so put out about , storming off this morning ? This was the worst she could do ? <p> Men could be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to the homely heart of California , to the constant light and heat and dust of farmland , leaving the rain and the gloom and their underground apartment for good . Richard had a connection-a friend of a friend of a friend ; even among the working class there are such inbred associations-and an established practice was waiting for him . After years of scholarships , he was that rarest of creatures , a dentist without debt . He did not even have to buy his own equipment . Money poured in after their months of thrift . During those first years-despite all her best intentions and Richard 's newfound means-she was still homesick for the dark winter of the Northwest , but then Mount St. Helens erupted , and it seemed to be a kind of signal to Zay that whatever life she knew in Oregon was over .

Every time she looks in the mirror she sees someone she might have known once upon a time : this middle-aged stranger whose hair belongs to her mother . There is a dowdiness she never would have recognized . When did that happen ? The answer is certain even as it is less than conclusive , just as beyond her son 's bedroom door there is certain to be the sleeping boy in the form of a man , although there is also the possibility that were she to open this door , she would find nothing more than the signature of the male : his escape-an opened window , its curtain flapping outside , caught like a flag in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Officer Perry put a hand on Zay 's knee and shook it , a form of threat in this gesture , for which Zay was unprepared .

Nothing about previous encounters with the deceased ? " <p> " I hardly ever saw her . Today was the first time I ever walked through the door . It 's crazy .

After standing in the freezing rain for twenty minutes , she caught the bus for work , and two stops later an enormous woman with three large shopping bags sat next to her . She sat down with a grunt , her shopping bags and a very wet umbrella wedged against Zay 's legs . Zay turned her face to the window and listened to the woman breathe until it was time to get off . When she stood to move out into the aisle , the woman barely moved , and Zay was forced to climb over a pair of massive knees and thighs , as though she were scaling a series of damp ledges . At the office , after a stern lecture from Dr. Browning-he had been forced to field his own phone calls , not one of which was from Officer Perry after all-she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments with the absentminded attention of a driver on a stretch of too-familiar highway . By the end of the day , she could not have said what it was that she had done during the day ; not one caller 's description of pain or symptom , behavior or reaction could replace the picture she retained of Mrs. Perls 's body , and her accompanying wig . <p> That evening , when Richard came home , he carried a paper cone of flowers . Apology for the morning 's argument . She cleaned out ajar and cut the stems while he struggled out of his overcoat and lab coat and sorted out the books and assignments jumbled together in his backpack . <p> " What 's with the tape across the hall ? It almost looks like a crime scene or something . " <p> She told him the story , going over it again as she had for Officer Perry , about coming out of the shower , her long thick hair wet and turbaned in a towel on top of her head , and then , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bump , a phantom sound . Maybe the headboard against the plaster wall ? Then a crash . Then the sight of Mrs. Perls on her bed . The wig next to her . The opened pill bottles . The ceramic shards of the lamp on the floor . Mrs. Dolby accusing her silently of murder . <p> " Poor Zay , poor baby , " Richard said , holding her . " What a lousy , mean-spirited thing . The old biddy . " <p> I 'm so sorry . So sorry . <p> She would remember that moment as the sweetest they would ever have . A melting into each other when Richard 's insistence during sex was matched by her own energy and resolve . Her own claims . Two equal combatants . Nothing after would ever quite live up to its promise , although she would n't notice this for years to come . <p> In the days to come , Zay would notice other changes : the yellow tape across Mrs. Perls 's door would slowly droop from the door frame , like a badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the manager 's apartment was occupied by an elderly couple whose energy with paintbrushes and cleaning rags , hammer and nails , pipe wrenches and pliers was impossible to ignore . <p> The cold of that icy , unheated winter would likewise give way to the warm rain of an early spring , and then one day Officer Perry showed up at the door of their apartment . Raindrops were jeweled in the frizz of her still-damaged hair . <p> " Listen , " she said , " I 've been meaning to stop by . And it looks like I came in the nick of time . " <p> Zay was standing in the middle of their apartment , surrounded by empty and half-filled boxes . Soon enough , she and Richard would be climbing the stairs to the front door with those same boxes and shoving them inside a small rental van , but now , although their door was open , the police officer blocked the threshold . <p> " You 're moving . " <p> " Yes . To California . My husband-my fiance , actually-has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " <p> " I suppose it is . I 've never lived anywhere but here . In Oregon , that is . Not this building . " <p> The police officer laughed . " I meant a husband with a job . That 's nice . " <p> Zay , too , was laughing . She could n't help it ; suddenly , it was all so funny . " It is nice , is n't it ? " <p> " I hope he makes a ton of money . And you can lie around all day , eating bonbons and drinking Scotch . " <p> " That does sound like fun , " she said , but as though down a long hallway of years , she had a glimpse of herself , waking late to a morning of alien expectation , and fun was not an accurate description . No , not quite . " Well , it would be a change . " <p> Their boxes lay around her , waiting for her attention . Richard 's textbooks , her clothes . Objects of optimism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> " And I wo n't keep you , " the officer said . " I just wanted to let you know that the final ruling was suicide , after all . The old lady had more junk in her system than Hendrix . " <p> What else could it have been ? <p> " Your neighbor did n't do you any favors , you know . " <p> " Mrs. Dolby , " Zay said . <p> " She said she saw you suffocating Mrs. Perls . She said she caught you in the act . You were holding a pillow over her face . She said she saw Mrs. Perls 's legs kicking . " <p> " But I told her , " Zay said . " The only thing I did with that pillow was to move it . She saw the pill bottles . " <p> " She left a note , you know . That was the clincher . " <p> " I never saw it . " <p> " She was dying anyway , and she knew it . Cancer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , she said . All those pictures on . the walls ? She was n't just a fan . She 'd had a thing for Sinatra for years , she went to Vegas every chance she got , but he was n't interested . Like there was a chance . There was one line from the note I remember : ' I 'm an old , tired , unhappy woman , and there are others to take my place . ' How about that ? " <p> Zay shook her head . Amazing . How could she have missed it ? So cold and wet with the window open and the rain blowing in , and she must have been in shock . She ca n't be sure that anything she remembers is the truth . Mrs. Perls 's death might be a story she 's telling to herself . <p> " I ca n't believe I never saw it , " she said finally . <p> " You remember how she must have pushed the lamp off her end table ? The note was in her other hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to pry it from her fingers . " <p> Was n't that always the way ? You look in one direction , but the answer always lies in another . <p> " But I ca n't believe Mrs. Dolby would do that . Lie like that . " <p> " People see what they want to see . Anyway , it 's over now , and you 're in the clear . You and your boyfriend can move to California , and you can put this behind you . " <p> She has done just that , she has put it behind her , and for nearly thirty years she has been caught in the stew of an ordinary life . Her decisions have never been deliberate , never calculated or weighed in any rational sense , but she has been satisfied with the outcome nonetheless . Everything has turned out all right . Yes , it has . Really . She will insist upon that to anyone who asks . Babies and diapers , Richard 's practice and their secure place with the others of their kind . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being , and maybe it is a kind of truth , but Zay better understands the necessity of the lie . They have no great love for one another , not now . After so many years , their marriage has turned into a kind of settling , and they do not often speak of the turmoil that marked their beginnings , preferring the realism of their years together rather than their first romantic gestures , those moments of passion , accusation , and reconciliation . They have turned her impulse into a life . <p> Since coming to California , they have made three more moves , one every ten years or so , each time into a progressively larger , more distinguished home . Their latest-six bedrooms , two stories , on five hillside acres overlooking dry riverbed-is so much larger than necessary , especially now that their daughters are gone and their son is nearly so , but they have no plans for contraction or economy in this next decade of life . They have chosen to move forward and forward only and forestall any chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being haunted by Mrs. Perls just now , Mrs. Perls with her wigs and her rings and her photographs . <p> Zay sometimes thinks of her life as a series of layers and layers . Of nothing profound , mind you , just the detritus of life : of soda pop and toothpaste , file folders and paperweights , the mundane objects of the everyday . If someone were to excavate her memory , he would need to make sense of such trash first . Mrs. Perls , on the other hand , is of a different order . Buried years ago under a mound of minor concerns but resurrected for some reason , still able to beckon . <p> One o'clock . Her son , wearing boxers and a T-shirt , wanders into the kitchen where Zay , while eating her lunch , is trying to read an article about the East German dissident Vera Wollenberger . After the opening of secret police files , Vera Wollenberger discovered that her own husband had been her most damaging informer . It may be a revelation for historians , this betrayal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zay wonders why anyone should be surprised . Even in the best of circumstances , a marriage is a kind of betrayal , an exchange of an ideal for a reality . Different only in degree . Her son is so sleep-fuddled that he runs into the refrigerator before opening it to peer inside . <p> " Oh , man , " he says . " There 's nothing in here to eat . " <p> " There 's ham on the bottom shelf , cheese in the bin , " Zay says by rote . " Make yourself a sandwich . " <p> The week after her discovery she divorced the man code-named Donald . <p> " Boring . " <p> " Too bad . " <p> He looks once more into the refrigerator 's clutter before letting the door swing shut . " Ah , fuck it , " he yawns . He looks at his mother . He looks through his mother . As though she were a window . " I 'm going back to bed . " <p> " Fine . You do that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Did Vera Wollenberger confront her husband , she wonders , or did she move out one night without a word of either accusation or explanation ? <p> I ca n't really say how I felt , Vera Wollenberger told reporters . It was such an extreme situation , rather as if one had died for a moment , and then returned to life . The surprising thing was the reports were written as if about a stranger , not about a wife . To him I was an enemy of the state , and he had done everything to fight me-the enemy . <p> Enough , enough , Time to go shopping for dinner . She gets her purse , finds her keys , and passing by the closed door of her son 's room , taps her fingers to the wood . Good-bye . <p> Her drive is not long . Two miles of sanitized streets and look-alike strip malls . In the supermarket , she retrieves a cart and wheels it through swept aisles of cat food and laundry detergent , pork chops and eggs and heads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys tortillas and cheese and chiles and sauce . Black beans and Spanish rice for the sides . This will be nice , she thinks . A California dinner . Richard will be pleased . But for some reason she can not rid herself of the picture of Mrs. Perls 's face , her body on the bed , the wig next to her head . She feels what it must be like to come to the end of things , and she pays for her groceries while shaking her head so violently that the checker must surely think she has some disagreement about the cost of living . <p> Leaving the parking lot . <p> Why is she revisiting all this now ? <p> She is fighting it , that 's the way it feels , as though she 's holding on by her fingers , this slipping out of one life , one time , and into another . Fighting it . She is leaning to the other side of the seat for the phone in the glove compartment . She needs to call Richard , maybe her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by speaking to one of them , she 'll be able to hang on to the present moment and let the past die from neglect . <p> Her eyes are on the parking lot the entire time , but while she fumbles for the phone in the midst of clutter-the gas slips and maps and owner 's manual-she finds herself slipping from the road to the glove box and she does n't wake until it is too late : an SUV , one of those lumbering giants , has backed out of its parking space , wallowing across the asphalt , and Zay , distracted , does n't see it . She reacts an instant too late . The smash of chrome and the tinkling bells of shattered headlight glass echo across the parking lot . She is still ransacking the glove box when her head lurches toward the dashboard . Oh , where has she gone now ? <p> The evening after her lunch with Geoffrey , she had come home , busy with plans . She would do the laundry , change the sheets , make dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops before her own in order to shop for their dinner . Something simple and cheap that might also pass for complicated and expensive . A bottle of wine , a lasagne , maybe . She trudged up the hill from the store with two grocery sacks in her arms , holding on tight to the bag with the wine , while a steady drizzle fell . Cars and trucks raced through the rain , sending up rooster tails of spray from the wet pavement while their wipers slapped back and forth . She shivered in the chill and struggled to keep her balance as the sidewalk turned to ice . Ah , but finally the gray clapboard sides of the Hill Villa emerged from the gray mist , and she walked down the stairs to the front door , juggling keys and bags like some sort of circus performer . One of those plate spinners on Ed Sullivan , maybe . Inside the door she set down the groceries and , taking off her scarf , shook out her hair . <p> " Well , look at you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass held in the same hand . " You 're so young , are n't you ? So pretty . Extraordinary . You and your long , thick hair . I 'll bet you have men falling in love with you eight days a week . " <p> " I would n't say that , " Zay said . " Not exactly . " <p> " Do n't be so modest . I 've seen your type come and go . " A gust of acrid smoke escaped along with the older woman 's bitter laugh . " Do n't take me seriously . I 'm old and envious . I looked like you once upon a time . I had a figure . And hair like yours . Do n't laugh , it 's true . " <p> " I was n't laughing . " <p> " I dated Sinatra , you know . " <p> " I did n't , " Zay said . " I did n't know that . " <p> " Me and Frank . Swanky Frankie . Three weeks at the Sands . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightgown and roses , and I knew my goose was cooked . " <p> Mrs. Perls dropped her cigarette to the wood floor of the hallway , stepping on it with the toe of her carpet slipper . <p> " Now , you , " she said . " You smell like sex . In the present tense , I might add . And not with your little Poindexter . " <p> So that 's when Zay stumbled , one of her knees must have buckled at just that moment , and down she went like a pile of sticks . In front of her own apartment door , no less . <p> " Hey , hey . Little Miss Cream Puff , " Mrs. Perls said , standing over her . " Maybe you need to eat something , maybe . " <p> How did the old witch know ? <p> How could she have known that lunch with Geoffrey had turned into an afternoon with Geoffrey , a farewell to the marriage for old times ' sake ? She had n't meant for it to happen , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened recently , and old habits never really die . Besides there 's no harm done , not really , not when it 's just between herself and Geoffrey and does n't concern anyone else . No one else needs to know . She got to her feet , a little unsteady in her ridiculous shoes . Her groceries were scattered across the hallway floor . The bottle of wine , miraculously unbroken , had rolled three doors down . Somehow she unlocked and opened her door , got herself and the elements of dinner inside , piece by piece . And then , there was not even time to sit down at the table and make a cup of tea before making her dinner of atonement when there was a knock on the door , and who could it be but Mrs. Perls again , holding a can of tomatoes that must have escaped her earlier . <p> Mrs. Perls has her tomatoes and a shoebox under her arm . She 's had her Scotch and now she 's turned into Chatty Cathy after weeks of silence and indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at her photographs , the record of her life . Just the person to understand the sort of person Mrs. Perls is . Well , she is n't , she has to cook dinner and maybe start that bottle of wine if she is to keep going , if she is to get through this night , but she ca n't say no to their landlady , now can she ? <p> Mrs. Perls is nattering on . Sinatra and Dean Martin , Bing Crosby and Hope and Astaire and Danny Kaye and all those old warhorses from the ' 40s and ' 50s . Who gives a shit , she wants to say . Who gives a shit ? Mrs. Perls is full of inside stories and she knows from personal experience which one of the boys had the biggest shlong and which one was all talk . Zay ca n't remember which is which . They 're all full of it , she thinks . There 's the back of Mrs. Perls 's head , her red hair that looks suspiciously like a wig because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there 's the way she sorts through her collection of photographs as though she would like to dive into the box of her past , disappear into it , she has just the picture she wants to show Zay , a picture of herself thirty years ago . I was about four years old , Mrs. Perls says , then laughs at her own lie . Maybe fourteen . Hall ha , ha . What a joke . <p> Yes , Mrs. Perls says . Here it is . She brandishes a snapshot and holds it for Zay to inspect . A professional must have taken this , Zay sees . Someone with some craft , albeit a few decades out of date . Mrs. Perls , ever so much younger , naked in some phony pose on a fainting couch , her long hair coiled around her breasts as though playing Godiva . Even so , take away the ferns and the columns and it 's impossible for Zay to miss it , how much she herself resembles this younger incarnation of Mrs. Perls . Look , Mrs. Perls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bogart before he met Bacall . Oh , she was a sly one , all right . <p> Her pasta is sitting on the table . Water must be put to boil , the sauce must be prepared . <p> Mrs. Perls holds up a snapshot of Gable . I could tell you stories , she says and seems about to start . <p> What I would n't give , Zay thinks . What I would n't give to see this old lady dead . <p> DAVID BOROFKA <p>
