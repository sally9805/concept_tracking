In addition to its daily spin and its annual trip around the Sun , the Earth wobbles-affecting the seasons , the ' ' ' north star , " and human history . // Winter brings the year 's longest nights-extra hours of darkness in which to watch the stars wheel their ways around our basic point of reference in the sky : a star named Polaris . Known today as the North Star ( for its unique status as the star most closely aligned with the projection of the Earth 's north pole on the sky ) , Polaris seems to stay steady no matter how long the dark night . The explorers who first sailed between continents clung to it for orientation in their travels . And yet , as surely as the nights will again grow shorter and the seasons will change , Polaris will lose its role as our north star . A slow cycle of the heavens will eventually bring Solaris hack to its familiar role-but not tor another 26,000 years , and not before other stars have taken their turn as celestial beacons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort by the world 's finest thinkers have led to a basic understanding of why the winter nights are cold and dark . Today most school-children know that the Earth rotates on its axis once each day and revolves around the Sun once every year-discoveries that long ago shook the very core of human understanding and led to the abandonment of the idea that the Earth lay at the center of the cosmos . Those two rhythms rule our lives : the Earth 's daily spin produces sunrise , sunset , and the alternation of night and day . Our planet 's annual trip around the Sun takes us through the cycle of seasons , winter to spring to summer to tall . And just how , exactly , does spring emerge from winter every year ? Not , as many believe , because the Earth 's elliptical path takes us closer to the Sun . Changes in the distance between Earth and Sun have only a modest effect on the seasonal cycle . Instead , seasonal variations arise because the Earth 's axis of rotation , the imaginary line through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to the plane of the Earth 's orbit around the Sun . The rotation axis tilts by about 23.5 degrees from perpendicular . It also maintains a constant orientation in space-in other words , with respect to the stars-throughout the course ot a year . So our annual motion alternately exposes each hemisphere , northern , then southern , then northern again , to more direct sunlight . That direct sunlight , as the Sun rises higher and stays longer in the sky , causes summer in the hemisphere that tilts toward the Sun and winter in the hemisphere that tilts away . ( The higher Sun and the longer days make roughly the same contribution to the seasonal differences , though of course the two effects are closely intertwined . ) On two days of the year , the spring and tall equinoxes ( which fall on or close to March 21 and September 22 each year ) , the Earth 's rotation axis tilts neither toward nor away from the Sun . On those two days , day and night have equal lengths all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were perpendicular to the plane of its orbit , rather than tilted , day and night would he equal throughout the year , and there would he no seasons to celebrate . Lurking within the faithful cycles of day and night , winter and summer , is a third cyclical motion , which arises from the Earth 's daily rotation and interacts with its annual revolution . That motion is called precession . It is , in essence , an almost imperceptibly slow wobble that creates a subtle and intriguing wrinkle in time . To visualize precession , imagine a top slowing down as it spins on the floor . Before it stops spinning entirely , it begins to wobble , its rotation axis rolling in various directions . As the axis changes direction , it sweeps out the shape of an upside-down cone , perpendicular to the floor ; that motion is precession . There is , of course , one big difference between the top and the Earth : the precession of the top can take less than a second ; the precession of the Earth takes almost 26,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in decades or even m centuries are so brief that for most practical purposes , the Earth 's axis continues to point in the same direction . Today , north in any season can be determined by noting the position of Polaris . In the long run . however , the spatial orientation of the Earth 's rotation axis does change . Every 26,000 years ( more accurately , every 25,785 years ) , the two points on the sky directly above the Earth 's North and South Poles-the extended ends of the axis of rotation-trace out complete circles on the background of stars . I he radius of each circle is equal to the tilt of the rotation axis . 23.5 degrees . Thus the rotation axis changes only its orientation , while maintaining a constant angle to the Earth 's orbital plane see diagram on this page , as it sweeps out an inverted cone in space . In spite of the glacial rate of precession , you ca n't fully understand ancient history or archaeology without taking account of the fact that Polaris has not always pointed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharaoh Khufu built the Great Pyramid , Polaris was nowhere near the " north celestial pole , " the point that lies directly above the Earth 's north pole at any particular time . In those days , astronomical observers relied on a much fainter star , Thuban , in the constellation Draco , the dragon , to serve as the north star ; they may even have oriented the galleries of the pyramid on the basis of Thuban 's position . One and a halfmillennia later , at the time Homer composed the Odyssey , precession had left Thuban relatively useless as a north star . Homer 's wandering hero Odysseus had to do his best with the Big Dipper-the seven bright stars of the constellation Ursa Major , or big bear , which then , as now , lay relatively close to the north celestial pole : " For so Kalypso , bright among goddesses , had told him to make his way over the sea , keeping the Bear on his left hand . In fact , the constellation would have moved around the sky quite a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult than Kalypso 's directions imply . Still , the Big Dipper was a rough-and-ready indicator of the way north see illustration above ) . The discovery of precession , like Homer 's great poem , was a signal achievement of ancient Greek culture . The Greek astronomer Hipparchus , who lived during the second century B.C. , is justly famous for being the first to note its effects . Hipparchus made his breakthrough not by observing the position of the north celestial pole , but rather by noting some of the other changes caused by precession . High among them are the times of the year when the Sun reaches particular points on the sky , as it seems to move among the constellations , blocking some of them from view . ( Astronomers now realize , of course , that it is the Earth that moves . ) Even as the orientation of the Earth 's rotation axis wobbles , or precesses , the Sun continues to take its yearly lap around the sky , along the path called the ecliptic . Although ancient astronomers could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various times of year , their excellent record keeping enabled them to accurately reconstruct which constellations provided a " house " tor the Sun at any given moment . There were twelve such houses , which match the familiar constellations , or signs , of the zodiac ; together they form a hand around the sky that includes the ecliptic . In the zodiacal system for keeping track of the year , created by astronomers in ancient Mesopotamia , each time the Sun entered a new house heralded the beginning of a new month . Every new year , moreover , began on the spring equinox when , as the Mesopotamians had determined , the Sun blocked the constellation Aries from sight . But Hipparchus noted that sometiling had happened during the two millennia since the Mesopotamian system had been codified : the Sun no longer occupied its specified position on the first day of spring . Instead , he determined , the Sun was reaching its marks along the ecliptic progressively earlier , by one day every seventy-two years . Because precession changes the times of the year of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal changes on Earth-the effect acquired its full title : " precession of the equinoxes . " If you could wait tor 365 times seventy-two years-approximately 26,000 years-you would find that the equinoxes take place once again at their original times of the year , because one full cycle of precession had finished . Nowadays on the spring equinox. the Sun is near the first point in the constellation Aquarius , which leads some astrologers to refer to our epoch as the " Age of Aquarius . " How seriously do you read your horoscope ? It you think the Sun 's position in a particular constellation has important effects in determining birth signs , yours is wrong ! Astrologers codified their basic principles roughly three millennia ago , and so precession has slipped the Sun 's location at any particular time of year by about one and a half zodiacal constellations . If the horoscope column says that you are a Libra , for instance , you are actually a Virgo or even a Leo ( assuming you judge by the Sun 's actual position along the ecliptic at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awkward fact by arguing that astrology has codified the meaning of the times of the year , not the location of the Sun against the backdrop of constellations in the zodiac . A minority sect , known as " new age astrologers , " insists that conventional astrology requires wholesale revision , precisely because of precession . Both groups agree , however , that in the 230th century , more or less , the two systems will once again coincide in their predictions and their accuracy . For astronomers , the chief effect of precession appears in star charts , which record the coordinates of celestial objects . Those coordinate systems usually designate a particular position on the sky-say , the Sun 's position at the time of the spring equinox-as their primary reference point . Hut precession continuously slides that point along the ecliptic , and-since most coordinate systems depend on the orientation of the Earth in space-it also changes the orientation of the coordinates that astronomers measure from that point . As a result , astronomers must attach a particular " epoch " to the coordinates they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( before that , it was January 1 , 1950 ) . Computers can readily make the small adjustments needed to update an object 's coordinates from the current epoch to the present time ; once fed into a telescope 's tracking system , the updated coordinates enable astronomers to work unfettered by precessional effects . Even in less meticulous circles , though , precession still rears its wobbly head . It affects the calendar , which must correct for the slippage in time that Hipparchus first noted . Our Gregorian calendar incorporates precession by changing the usual rule for leap years : It omits the leap day in every century year , such as 2100 , that is not evenly divisible by 400 . What causes precession ? The answers are gravity , angular momentum , and the fact that the Earth has a bit of a belly around its midsection , a bulge at the equator . The bulge itself arises from the Earth s rotation , which tends to fling the planet s central regions outward . The gravity of the Sun and the Moon attract the bulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , " attempting to make its rotation axis perpendicular to the plane of its orbit . ( The plane of the Moon 's orbit around the Earth happens to nearly coincide with the plane of the Earth 's orbit around the Sun , so both the Moon and the Sun act in nearly the same way on the bulge . ) If the Earth did not rotate , or if it rotated extremely slowly , the two objects would indeed set the Earth 's rotation axis nearly upright . But because the Earth rotates rapidly , the net effect of the Sun 's and Moon 's gravity on the Earth 's bulge drives precession . Draw the vectors , do the math , and you find that the forces give rise to a 26,000-year circle , never changing the amount of tilt but continuously varying the Earth 's orientation in space . Polaris , which has acted as the north star since the time of Columbus , will continue to serve us well tor many more centuries ; in fact , the north celestial pole on the sky will move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually , however , the celestial pole will wander on , and Polaris will no longer work as a good north star . Our descendants will labor under virtually the same handicap that our brethren in the Southern Hemisphere have for centuries . Bereft of a south star , they have been forced to compensate by using the Southern Cross as a pointer toward the south celestial pole . In about 11,800 years , just over halfway through the cycle of precession from now , the northern end of the Earth 's rotation axis will point almost directly at the extremely bright star Vega . In those navigationally favorable times , from the 130th through the 150th centuries ( more or less ) , no one will have trouble finding the way north on a clear starry night see illustrration on page 22 . Do other planets process ? Certainly , provided they , too , are not spinning perpendicularly to their orbital planes , and provided they have equatorial bulges gravitationally affected in the same way that the Sun 's gravity affects the Earth . Although astronomers have never directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an observer on , say , Mars could detect the same kind of processional changes that we find tor Earth . But the rotation axis of a tilted spinning object is not tile only thing that processes . If an orbit is not perfectly circular , its long axis can change its orientation in space , giving rise to a precession of the entire orbit . For example , the Moon 's orbit around the Earth undergoes just such a precession , historically called the " regression of the Moon 's nodes . " The full cycle of precession lasts 18.6 years , which explains why eclipse " seasons " also vary over an 18.6-year cycle . Another important example of orbital precession affects the elliptical orbit of Mercury . Astronomers who studied the orbit during the nineteenth century observed a relatively large precessional effect . They calculated that the gravity of the other planets could account for more than 90 percent of the observed precession , But try as they might , a small fraction ot the total remained unexplained-forty-three seconds of arc per century . Since each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds of arc , the unexplained precession of Mercury 's orbit seemed trivial . But that " trivial " amount turned into a key piece of confirming evidence tor Einstein 's general theory of relativity . Einstein 's theory makes a precise prediction ot the amount of precession of Mercury 's orbit , by calculating how much the Sun bends space ( and time ) in the neighborhood of the planet . The theory 's prediction corresponded almost exactly with the observed precession , and played a crucial role in gaining rapid acceptance among scientists for Einstein 's revolutionary hypothesis . So if anyone asks yon why you should care about precession , be prepared to answer with confidence and pride . Not for any reason linked to daily life , for eclipses and star charts remain the provinces of astronomers . Rather , precession turns out to describe a deep truth about the cosmos , worth understanding in its own right . If your questioner demands more than that , ask him or her to consider what the discovery of precession could have meant to earlier civilizations . In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend , speculated that precession was known not only to Hipparchus in the second century B.C. , but also to the Babylonians , many centuries earlier . Such a discovery must have been mind-boggling : Precession became the vast impenetrable pattern of fate itself , with one world-age succeeding another , as the invisible pointer of the equinox slid along the signs , each age bringing with it the rise and downfall of astral configurations and rulerships , with their earthly consequences . Then ask : Could precession really have seemed so impressive to our ancestors ? Have we become so indifferent to the cosmos since they looked to the skies and expounded a host of explanations that we have lost our sense of wonder ? And it so , are we better or worse off than they were , adrift in space on our rotating , revolving , precessing planet ? Sidebar Our twirling Earth , bulging at the equator from its spin , slowly wobbles in space as the Sun 's gravity tries to pull it upright . Sidebar Earth undergoes three periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun , and a slow precession , or wobble , of its rotation axis . The wobble causes the axis to sweep out an inverted cone in space above the Northern Hemisphere . The axis traces a complete circle on the sky every 26,000 years see illustration on page 24 . Polaris and Vega each serve as " north star , " at intervals of 12,000 to 74,000 years . Sidebar Circular trace ( blue ) on the map of stars shows how the direction of the Earth 's rotation axis precesses , or wobbles , with time , as seen from Earth . Today 's north celestial pole-the point directly above the Earth 's north pole-lies close to the star Polaris . In Egyptian times , roughly 4,500 years ago , the star Thuban served as the north star , and in about 12,000 years the north celestial pole will pass near Vega . Sidebar From the 130th through the 150th centuries , when Vega becomes the north star , no one will have trouble finding north .
