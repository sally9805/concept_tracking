We 've come a long way . What we must do to stay well // As A MEDICAL WRITER , I spend my days talking to medical experts . But I 'm not exempt from the health issues I share with many other Black women . I 've had to contend with a smoking habit ( which I kicked ) and obesity ( which I have n't yet ) . I 've lived through broken bones , gallstones , infections and cancer scares . Diabetes , stroke and cancer run in my family and my mother , sisters and aunts have suffered everything from abnormal Pap tests to brain tumors . Over the years we 've learned to be vigilant about our health and take action against illness . Consider my mother . Several years ago , she noticed that a mole on her arm was growing larger and darker . A few days later she was sitting in a surgeons office . " They did n't want to see me that day but I insisted , " she said . The surgeon sadly confirmed that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90-percent mortality rate . But that 90 percent of cases are n't t typically treated as early as my mother 's , so she seized an advantage . Over the next months , she prayed-but she also underwent surgeries , endured a troublesome skin graft and took daily medication . Today Mom is 75 , active and cancer-free . We sisters are barraged by stories bemoaning our high risks for cancers , diabetes , AIDS and other killers . But our health status is n't all bad news : We can see important improvements when we compare our current health situation to our circumstances 30 years ago . Besides , being at risk does n't mean being doomed . A Black woman can pass down a legacy just as important as any genetic propensity : a penchant for taking care of herself Using tools such as regular medical care , a nutritious diet , exercise and timely screening tests , we can turn our odds around . We 're already doing it . In the pages that follow , we examine our health history to take a look at how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do to ensure a healthier future for ourselves and our families . The 1910 's : Platforms and the Pill Thirty years ago , seven Black college women crowded into my best friend 's dorm room . Sporting bell-bottoms , platform shoes and huge " fros , we gathered to pore over our first copies of EssENCE . Finally a magazine just for us . In 1970 Black women lived at the intersection of the Civil Rights and the Women 's Movements , the century 's two major cultural revolutions . Until then , no one was telling Black women 's stories , and our health was a totally alien topic . " Thirty years ago , Black women were less demanding of good health care , " says Yvonne S. Thornton , M.D. , M.EH. , director of perinatal diagnostic testing at New Jersey 's Morristown Memorial Hospital and author of Woman to Woman : A Leading Gynecologist Tells You All You Need to Know About Your Body and Your Health ( button , $24.95 ) . " We were happy just to have someone look at us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Black woman then was 68 years-eight years fewer than that of a White woman . We were n't taking such good care of ourselves , partly because we did n't know the dangers we faced . For example , we thought heart disease was a White man 's illness  --  and so did our doctors . " Women 's classic cardiovascular disease symptoms were more likely to be attributed to anxiety or gastrointestinal problems than to heart disease , " says cardiologist Charles K. Francis , M.D. , president of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles . Because of gender and racial bias , the disease was underdiagnosed in sisters . The same was true for breast cancer , then considered a White woman 's disease . Mammography vans had been tooling around White suburbs for years , but they did n't visit our neighborhoods . If we discovered a lump , the treatments for cancer were crude and few . Back in the day a woman might go into surgery for a biopsy and wake up without a breast . Although it affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four of us knew what sickle-cell disease was in 1970 ; there were no effective therapies and 35 percent of its victims died in childhood . Thirty years ago we talked about sex in primitive terms . Extramarital pregnancy was still shameful , and abortion was a crime everywhere . Until 1965 contraception was illegal in many states . The advent of birth-control pill freed sisters sexually , but the sexual revolution also unleashed a wave of herpes , gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections . And while reliable birth control was an unalloyed blessing for newly liberated White women , its promise of reproductive freedom was tarnished for Black women by suspicions of genocide . Women who had sexual relationships with other women were thought to have a psychological disorder ( " lesbianism " was listed as a disease in psychiatrists ' manuals ) . On the other hand Black women were n't thought to suffer from common mentalhealth issues . We were portrayed as matriarchal and castrating-and too strong to succumb to depression and suicide . During those times , when many Blacks considered psychology irrelevant-even dangerous-ESSENCE offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Media Center at Judge Baker Children 's Center , reassured sisters that mental-health care could be positive and helpful , but wrote that " too often White psychiatrists and social workers harbor prejudices toward Blacks .... " Such articles addressed the health concerns closest to the hearts of Black women and set the stage for today 's discussions . Today : HIV Tests and " Mammo-Vans " Our growing sophistication has helped improve our health profile dramatically since 1970 . " In one generation Black women have taken full advantage of opportunities and made a surprising show of their strength and resilience , " notes Poussaint . Our efforts have paid off . Life expectancy has increased from 68 to 74 years . Black teenage girls are leading the nation in lowering the extramarital pregnancy rate and in avoiding smoking and alcohol . Today Black women are ahead in taking Pap tests for cervical cancer , and our mammography rate shot up from 24 percent in 1987 to 64 percent in 1994 . ( Those vans are cruising our neighborhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , for example , poses a huge threat to AfricanAmericans . Black people constitute 12 percent of the population but 37 percent of all Americans with AIDS . Approximately 62 percent of the women with AIDS are Black ( only 18 percent are White ) , and we make up a growing proportion of new cases among African-Americans . Fortunately , the number of Blacks dying from this disease is declining , but much more slowly than the number of Whites . Heart disease remains the greatest killer of Black women . Fill a small city with 100,000 sisters , and within the year , AIDS will take out 14 of us , but heart disease will kill 224 . The death rate for stroke is 34 percent higher for Black females than the rate for White women . Fortunately physicians now better understand women 's heart risks and how to control them with stabilized blood pressure , a healthy weight , nutritious diet , exercise , medication and certain vitamins . Unfortunately ; fewer than 30 percent of Black folks address these risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Center , Ann Arbor . Take smoking : To defeat heart disease , we need to kick the habit , but about 23 percent of African-American women still light up . Further , 65 percent of Black women are overweight . While many sisters tend to accept a few extra pounds as normal-even attractive-obesity is a condition with all sorts of negative health implications . " Obesity is like the moose at the dinner table : No one wants to comment on it , but we know it 's there , " observes Thornton . Most physicians agree that fat is ruining the health and quality of life of African-American women  --  contributing to depression , stress and discrimination while also putting us in increased danger of heart disease . // Days of Our Lives // The same lifestyle changes that will ease heart disease can also lower our death rates from the other biggest killers of Black women today-cancer , stroke and diabetes . We 're more likely than White women to die from breast , uterine and cervical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late diagnoses ; we seek help too late for the most effective treatments to work . Screening and early diagnosis will close the gap . Approximately 2.3 million Blacks 20 and older have diabetes , and one out of every four Black women over 55 suffers from the disease . Our genes are a factor , but it is fat , not fate , that impacts diabetes most . Type II diabetes , which accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases , can be controlled with proper diet , weight loss and exercise , often decreasing the need for medication . Black folks who do n't treat their condition are twice as likely as others to go blind and 2.5 times as likely to have a leg amputated . We 've still got a lot to conquer : domestic violence , poor reproductive health , stress and substance abuse , to name a few . To make matters worse , 19 percent of Blacks have no regular doctor , and as a result we are twice as likely as others to get care in an emergency room . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stronger relationships with our health-care providers and seek timely , adequate care . The Next Millennium : Vaccines and Genes How healthy will we be 30 years from now ? In order to continue the progress we 've made since 1970 , " we must take control of our own future , " says Thornton . If we do , here 's a glimpse of what lies in store : We 'll have to lighten up . But we 'll need a serious strategy because humans are genetically programmed to keep getting fatter . In the Stone Age , when food was scarce and our hunter-gatherer ancestors worked hard for every bite , their genes allowed their bodies to turn food into the needed fat that enhanced their chances of survival . Today there 's a grocery store on every corner , but that fat gene still works . By 2030 more than 75 percent of American women will be over- weight . We sisters are already the heaviest group in the country , but if we adopt healthier habits jettison junk food , eat less meat , drink more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll heal our hearts . The next three decades will bring effective medications and treatments for hypertension and heart disease . " Drug companies are finally focusing on African-American women in their testing , " says Nesbitt . " Drugs have been tested on White Americans with the assumption that they 'll work the same in Blacks , but this is not the case . " Medicine is n't the only answer : Exercise and leaner diets will help our hearts , too . We 'll win the war on cancer . There are so many drugs and devices in development that the sheer law of probabilities is on our side . We may be able to detect and zap-a cancer long before it forms a tumor . Cancer-quelling genes will be delivered via viruses ; vaccines will immunize us against common cancers . But such advances will mean little if we do n't get earlier diagnoses via screening tests and regular physician visits . We 'll collect designer genes . Instead of medical charts , each of us can expect individualized risk profiles based on genetics and lifestyle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual genetic profiles . We hope gene therapy will cure heart disease , sickle cell and diabetes . We 've already had a heady taste of success : Last December the first child-a Black boy-was effectively treated for sickle cell disease by gene therapy . We 'll have an AIDS vaccine . Bv 2030 HIV is expected to linger in only one half of 1 percent of the U.S. population . But people of color who today find it harder than Whites to get expensive AIDS drugs may have the same difficulty in 2010 , when a vaccine is expected to be introduced . We 'll have to fight to make sure we 'll benefit from new treatments-and still practice prevention . We 'll lead alternative lifestyles . In 30 years researchers will have completed much of the work that will allow us to separate the pearls of alternative medicine-acupuncture , massage , nutritional supplements-from the fools ' gold . We wo n't act our age . The real triumph of medicine will be the delay of not only death but also " old age . " We 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond . In 2030 we can also look forward to a more positive health experience , if we stay on the right path . Education , vigilance and action will let us arrive in the future in sync with all Americans . As we said in the 1970 's , right on time . Sidebar Health Care Goes to Washington Access to culturally sensitive , quality health care is " the new civil-rights battlefield in America , " says Representative Donna M. Christian-Christensen , M.D. , chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust . But our advocates inside the beltway are working to eliminate health-care disparities . With some $3.2 billion allocated for minority health care , U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher , M.D. , Ph.D. , seeks to close the racial health divide between Blacks and Whites by 2010 . " We in the Office of Public Health and Science have selected six areas to begin our focus : infant mortality , breast and cervical cancer screening and management , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , HIV/AIDS and immunizations , " he says . Christian-Christensen , a physician and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed at improving the health status of women and people of color . For example , bill H.R.1860 will require managedcare organizations to contract with health-are providers in medically underserved areas . Other health-conscious bills before Congress seek to increase funding for research on lupus , address the needs of sickle-cell anemia patients , support programs to prevent asthma , provide funding for community and faith-based HIV/AIDS programs and improve the health care of women in prisons . But Black women ca n't leave it to the pots ; we also have to advocate far our own health . Christian-Christensen encourages women to contact their representatives about these initiatives . Sisters with Internet access can contact their representative at www.congress.gov . Or call Capitol Hill at ( 202 ) 224-3121. - H.a.w . Sidebar Pass or Fail ? How we score on preventive exams According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , women should have a mammogram and a Pap test , as well as tests for blood pressure at least once a year . Some others to schedule : dental , HIV , glaucoma and glucose testing . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start having them and the latest information available on the percentage of women tested . Sidebar Six Steps to Wellness Look at us ! The twentieth century is a testament to the strides we 've made ; the twenty-first century is ours for the taking . But we must first ensure that our health-mental , physical and spiritual-is intact . Byllye Avery , founder of the National Black Women 's Health Project a grassroots health-advovacy organization , offers these six strategies to keep us healthy and balanced in the new era : 1 . Make at least one health promise to yourself-and keep it . For example , " I promise to get a complete physical exam this year , " or " I promise to eat three vegetables a day . " 2 . Schedule your annualOB-GYN exam . If you have n't already had your pelvic exam this year , remember that your reproductive and sexual health are important to your total health and well-being . 3 . Make physical exercise a part of your daily life . Find big and small ways to be active . Do sit-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . 4 . Foster supportive and healthy relationship . Nurture friendships and relationships that sustain you , end those that drain or dishonor you . 5 . Create an altar . On it , place photos , candles and other objects that bring you peace . Pray or meditate , and ask your Supreme Being for the peace and joy that comes from a spirit filled life . 6 . Become more knowledgeable about the health status of Black women . Make a commitment to read at least one health article or publication every month . - AKISSI BRITTON Author Affiliation Harriet A.
