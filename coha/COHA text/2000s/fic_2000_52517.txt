ground . The screen door 's got cardboard laid in and the rock chimney leaks mortar like a pastry filling . The roof is more sky than shingle . At sixteen years old I wanted to be far away , and by seventeen I was long gone and wishing I was still home . Now I am back in the hills after fifty years and a stranger to them . The land is just emptied of me . <p> More than once I 've run into somebody I knew from before and it turned out to be not them but their grandkid , who acted like I was on the crazy pills . I felt lost and that is a bad feeling when you are standing on dirt you knew as a baby . People say time moves forward but I say not . We do everything to time-mark it with a calendar and a clock , then blame it for the age on our face . I am too old to envy young people because I know where youth ends up at . <p> People do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacktop and the paths are growed over . My old grade school is nothing but a weed field . It was built by the W.P.A. and my grandpa worked that crew , dragging rock off the hillsides . He said them letters stood for " We Piddle Around . " They were marked in stone over the schoolhouse door . Now they stand for " Wiped Plumb Away . " This ai n't home , it 's what home was . <p> The birds are raising Cain all over the woods . Of the evening there 's a mockingbird that copies them like a one-man band , and during the day I sit and study the woods for the mockingbird . It has to be in there keeping track of each sound in its head . I spent most of my life doing that  --  copying what was around me so nobody 'd know I was from off . It never worked . Now that I 'm home , I find myself copying the way I used to talk . It 's like putting on a mask of your own face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along comes a car driving on ground where the road used to run . I do n't know what to think . Company is not something I figured to ever have again , and it scares me some . I came home to be left alone . I wish I was up on the ridge setting on my spot . <p> The car stops and the driver gets out carrying a satchel , wearing sunglasses , and dressed for town . I do n't know her from Adam 's cat . <p> " Are you Darla Lily Caudill ? " she says . <p> " Yes . " <p> " I 'm Pearl Manning . " <p> " Do n't believe I know any Mannings . " <p> She does n't like that . I can tell by the way her mouth goes tight , like it 's full of cusswords you ca n't say because you 're around churchy people . <p> " I 'm not from here , " she says . <p> I felt a little for her then because I know what that 's like . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't registered yet , " I say . <p> " What ? " <p> " But if I was , I 'd vote for you . " <p> " I 'm not running for office , " she says . " I wanted to talk with you about your land . " <p> " Taxes are paid . " <p> She shifts the satchel on her shoulder and glances around for somewhere to sit , which I take for a bad sign . When healthy strangers in Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes want a chair without being offered , you just know what they 've got to say is what you ai n't wanting to hear . I let the quiet hang . The morels are long gone , the trilliums are withered , and moss is lush . Kentucky is one green summer . Goldfinches line through the trees like fancy stitching on a cowboy shirt . <p> " I 'm a realtor , " she says . " You look to me like you have a nice spot here . " <p> I nod . <p> " It might be that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'd be more comfortable in a different setting . " <p> I nod again . <p> " A place , " she says , " where you do n't have to be concerned with cooking your own meals , or mowing the grass . A place where you can relax . " <p> Realtors I do n't trust . I knew one to visit a funeral home anytime somebody died . He 'd go there all three days of the service and buddy up to the family like they was kin , telling them all manner of lie . A week later , you just know who 's selling the dead man 's house . <p> " You 're too early , " I say , " I 'm still yet living . " <p> " I can see that , " she says . " You just might enjoy living out your twilight years in a more comfortable situation . " <p> " I 'm pretty comfortable . " <p> " Let 's put it another way . This land has desirable qualities . You 're in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I 'm doing that right this minute . " <p> She takes in a breath of air big enough to give life to a mule . She hunches her shoulders . <p> " I 'm talking mobile home community , " she says . " I 'm talking ten thousand dollars per lot . I 'm talking serious development . " <p> Her satchel starts ringing . She pulls out a phone and turns away for privacy . Right there on my land , she shows me her back , and I remember the eight-family party line we had when I was a kid . There was so many people listening in , you did n't use the phone to talk to one person , you used it to spread gossip through the hills . Many 's the person the whole creek got mad at over lies that started on the telephone . People do n't think nothing of making a lie bigger . It 's truth they want to be small . <p> The realtor turns around and smiles . " Where were we ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holler with trailers . You 'll not be satisfied until you have baldheaded these hillsides . " <p> " You 're mistaken , " she says . " The intent is always there to preserve the integrity of the natural landscape . " <p> " See how you are . As soon as you start lying , you stop talking English . " <p> " Bottom line , " she says . " You can stay out here and die . Or you can get rich . " <p> She lifts her satchel and offers a business card . I watch it like she 's holding a dead rat . She glances around for somewhere to put it , then jams the card into a split gap on the porch strut . <p> " Call when you change your mind , " she says . <p> " I did n't come home to sell out . " <p> She looks at the sagging roof , the wind-blown chimney , the weeds around the dry well . It 's hard to see where the yard ends and the woods begin . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seems honest to me . Even her voice is different when she speaks . <p> " Then why did you come home ? " <p> She walks back to her car and backs along the tracks she 'd made driving in . The road and the yard are the same . I ca n't for sure say why I came back . I never fit in here as a girl , but I fit in even less outside of the hills . For years I did n't think there was a place for me . Now a stranger 's got one all picked out . Her visit makes me feel like a ghost haunting my own house . <p> The sky is hanging above the hills like a bolt of cloth . I set out walking . The ground is soft as potato peels . To see in the woods , you have to get in the right position  --  above the brush but under the tree limbs  --  and it 's best to squat but my squatters are give out on me . The light turns gauzy , filtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the ridge I find my spot . It 's no more than a low rock jutting out of the hillside , but it 's where I came when I was a girl . Back then , I used to pretend nobody knew about it but me . Now it 's true . <p> I lower myself to the cold rock and stare at the night . Maybe I came back just to sit in my spot . An owl hollers . Stars light the land like candle flame . Where my house is at is untelling and I decide to head for high ground and get a fix on the land . I know how the hills are laying , even at night . I use saplings to pull myself up the slope , stepping over the dark patches that are fallen limbs . A whippoorwill starts in calling . The crickets and tree frogs make a racket . Briars scrape my face and the air is turning off bad cold . <p> At the ridgetop my foot slips on a mossy rock . I try to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide down the slope like the land moving a sponge over itself . I fall off a limestone outcrop to the rain branch below . My back hits rock and my legs land in water . <p> I lay not moving for I do n't know how long , just listening to leaves brush the air like the woods is breathing . One whole side of my body does n't work . Breathing hurts bad . I 'm cold and wet and ca n't get up . After a while , the mockingbird lights up the air with its call . I hear all the other birds in its cry , and I wonder if the mockingbird still has its own . Out west I copied so many ways of talking , I lost mine . <p> My spot used to be on the ridge , but now it 's down here in the holler . I know I 'm in a bad way . I wait for my life to flash before my eyes , or all the regrets to run off me , or a tunnel full of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the woods , the way I spent all my time as a girl . I do n't even know if the years have changed me all that much . These woods are the same , only each tree is a little fuller in the middle and sagging some below . <p> The moon is laying in the sky , tipped on its belly . The land smells good . I close my eyes . The mockingbird gives off one more call and I understand why I came home . <p> <p> By Chris Offutt <p>
