WE DRIVE THE RENO STRIP before dawn and it 's all bright lights and casinos : gin and tonic at five A.M. , fancy ladies with drooping eyelids , the clank of old-fashioned slots and the zippity hum of electronics ; an occasional rattle of coins . Dawn sees some gamblers weary with defeat and completely busted . They park before used car dealers and wait for the lots to open . They sell their cars cheap in order to get breakfast and bus fare home . <p> Me , and Pork , and Victoria ( my comrades ) drive through this glossy city as morning rises quick above the desert . We say very little , because Pork is dreamy and Victoria is crazed . We flee like refugees , though we do n't flee far . <p> Storyland sits at city limits , between the town and the desert . When we approach , it looks like a hangar for monster airplanes , being of round metal roof and immense . It does not look like a book barn , though it is . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent lights . Lights hang way , way up there , sending glowing messages from an awkward heaven . This is a freakin ' church , a financial cathedral . <p> My comrades and I take our places before stainless tables , with dumpsters at our backs . I 'm in the center with Pork on my left . Victoria giggles on my right . Dust collectors hum , conveyer belts slide slicky  --  sounding , and we snag packages from conveyors which trundle before us . We open packages . We work like dogs and are paid like dogs . Employee turnover is fantastic . Still , a few genuine nut-cases hang on ; plus us . We like it here . We say we 're on Weird Row . We 're talkin ' revolution . <p> The packages contain books , audios , videos , but mostly books . Thoughts and amusements of two thousand years trickle through our hands . <p> It works like this : The Corporation owns Storyland and sends books to every country in the world . Packages go out , but packages also come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shops the Net . It finds needed books at small bookstores in Denver or Ashtabula or Cape Town . The small stores ship the books here for Storyland to resell . Workers who are higher paid repackage the books and send them to customers . Those workers get higher pay because what they do is boring . We , here on Weird Row , get the best part of the job . <p> Books on necromancy mix with Bibles , and children 's picture-books rest beside dusty philosophies from two hundred years ago . History , evolution , how to raise a family cow .. you name it , we open it .. all kinds and colors of books spit forth , plus : there is packaging . <p> " Plus , " Pork reminds me , " there 's Package Police . " He checks the terrain with heavy-lidded gaze as he speaks . Conveyers hum all around , and other teams open packages . We do n't speak to other teams . Who needs ' em ? <p> Pork looks rested . Many years ago there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Pork . Five foot tall and five foot around , like a giant bowling ball with a fluffy head . He has hazel eyes and the kind of beard you find on billy goats . <p> " There 's also denouements . " Victoria generally sounds cultured . She is virginal and sweet and only slightly insane . She has no business in a candy-fanny town like Reno . Victoria should be gliding along marble halls while wearing a satin gown . She should be waving a wand that casts sparkles . Victoria is knock-down-dead gorgeous , little and cute , like a movie queen , like Hepburn . " There 's visualizations , " she says , " and actualizations and excitements . There 's also a certain amount of stardust . " <p> I make no big claim to sanity , either . If I am sane , why am I in Reno ? My name ... ? It seems a guy would remember .. I 'm sure my mom recalls it , but she lives in New Hampshire . Around here they call me Smoke . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm skinny and going on thirty with bright eyes and yellow teeth ; a nice smile to go with it , a tidy little cough . I lust after Victoria . Fat chance . Lotsa luck , buddy . <p> " Package Police , " Pork says , again . Even wide awake and rested , Pork sounds dreamy . Dreamy is dangerous . When he gets too dreamy , Pork fondles books . <p> The Corporation ca n't allow that . A man who fondles books is liable to steal something : a notion , an essence , an idea . A man who fondles books might learn a trade , develop a philosophy , found a religion . All through history , book fondlers have been known to commit creative acts . Around here , Book Fondling is a godawful sin . <p> After all , those books belong to The Corporation , and The Corporation has its own philosophy . The Corporation not only wants its fair share . The Corporation wants to own Everything . The Corporation will not be stolen from . Thus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Victoria whispers . She is excited . She places a book titled Teach Yourself Celtic in Your Spare Time on the conveyer , then slowly turns to dispose of packaging . Recycle goes in one dumpster , reusable packaging in another . The Celtic book had been wrapped in newspaper . A headline flatly states : <p> VAPORS EXCITE CAT SHOW , PULcHRITUDINOUS KITTY DEEDS FURBALL <p> " No story enclosed , just headline . " Victoria speaks with some chagrin . <p> " None needed , " Pork whispers . " We got enough to work with . " Pork sounds as excited as Pork ever sounds , which is to say , real dreamy . <p> " Put a sock in it , " I tell them . " We got problems . " <p> A Package-Police cruiser has just pulled a U-ey at the end of our conveyor row . It heads toward us . The cruiser is electric and only big enough to hold one cop and one prisoner . <p> " Pulchritudinous , " Pork says , and says it real dreamy . I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This cop has missed his place in history . He 's a perfect model for a Storm Trooper or an Alabama Deputy ; an Adolf or a Bubba . He chaws on a toothpick and wears short sleeves to show his biceps . His brush cut stands spikey above blue eyes that ca n't help looking at the front of Victoria 's shirt . <p> " You creeps , again , " he says , and gives me a shove just hard enough to mess up what I 'm doing . " Keep workin ' . " <p> I place a book titled Ergonomics and Policy Reform in 13th Century Mesopotamia on the conveyor . The packaging was bubble wrap . I toss it into the reusable material dumpster . Pick up another package . <p> This particular cop always shoves me when he 's after Pork ... something , Victoria always explains , that they teach you in cop school . <p> " You moved your lips funny , " the cop says to Pork . " Say it again . " " Cheeseburgersforlunch , " Pork tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have ready-mades for occasions like this . " We were talkin ' lunch , " Pork says . " Before that we were talkin ' breakfast . " <p> " And now you 're talkin ' bull . " The cop knows full well he 's in the presence of subversion . He knows we 're stealing thoughts , but does n't have enough to hang us . <p> We got rights . The cop does n't even have enough on us to justify a mild beating . He 's one frustrated jockstrap . <p> " With French Fries , " Victoria says , and says it most sweetly . She zips open a package containing Pachyderms of the Circus : Their Wit and Wisdom . This one is wrapped in newspaper . She deftly , and with no seeming regret , tosses the paper into recycle . We who know her , though , feel her sorrow . We caught a fleeting headline , something like : SYMPHONY GOES 0 AND 1 AGAINST MENDELSSOHN . <p> Something to think about . And we will . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to join us for lunch , " I say in a loud whisper , " but then we 'd be fraternizing . " I figure the cop is so dumb he 'll think it 's a compliment . I think rightly . <p> " Another suck-up , " he says . When he finally leaves we shelve Mendelssohn for the moment , then once more discuss a question of law . <p> It is true we steal words and thoughts , but we 're not stealing them from the books . We 're taking them from the packaging . Plus , things fall out of books : pressed flowers , locks of hair , clippings ( usually obituaries or marriages ) , bookmarks , snapshots , postage stamps , love letters , receipts , and postcards . It 's all throwaway stuff . <p> So , if it 's junk , who owns it ? The Corporation says , " Throw it away . " " You ca n't steal something that 's been thrown away , " Pork always explains . " That 's our fall-back position . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beating , and find ourselves in front of a judge , that 's our defense . " <p> " Pulchritudinous , " Victoria murmurs . " Nobody is gon na throw something like that away . That 'll be their claim . " <p> " Plus , " I say , " they got lawyers . They own the judge . We got minimum wage . " <p> " And the joy of combat , " Pork tells me . " We got the pleasure of taking stuff right under The Corporation 's drippy little nose . " Pork can talk vicious when he wants . <p> " Every day , " Victoria murmurs , " I take an idea , or an image , or a word away from here . I set it loose in the world . That , I believe , is Pulchritudinous . " Victoria sometimes gets a dazed look whilst talking philosophy . <p> She is describing our mission . Our mission is not to defy The Corporation , but to subvert . We are warriors . That 's the truth . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plymouth-inEngland , or Carrolton , Kentucky , they look just great . The Corporation has slicked them . Spots on covers have been cleaned . Torn dustjackets have been repaired . Lots of them look new , and all of them look snazzy . Like Reno . <p> But , I 've seen inside some of those books . The words are still there , the ideas , the theories , the stories ; but somehow life is gone . It 's like everything in them is written on a dying desert wind . The books show color but have no heat of impassioned brains or beat of loving hearts . It 's a giant gyp . The Corporation keeps the life of the book and sells the husk . Just like Reno . <p> Our subversion comes because we hijack words , ideas , dream-stuff , and yeah , occasional stardust . We hijack entire concepts , plus screwball visions . We can take a headline , a cat show , and talk it through . Then , we take it outside of Storyland and set it free . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city limits , it has a strong chance for a healthy life . " Lunch , " Pork says , and really means it . <p> We get take-out burgers at a roadhouse , then roll the car a mile into desert . The land is flat and covered with sage . In some places small hills rise , also sage-covered . We choose our spot with great care because The Corporation has spies . If we get caught doing what we 're about to do , the least that will happen is fractures . <p> I smoke a butt , smoke another . In the distance Reno seems to dance through heat waves , a tired and faded dance . The Corporation fits right into Reno . The Corporation came here because of tax stuff and central shipping . Birds of a feather . <p> We draw on burgers , pretending that we hold a conversation about nothin ' . We look here , there , every place . When we spot no spies , Victoria murmurs a little chant , tosses in a small but mystical spell . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wand . She opens her hand . Pulchritudinous flies free . <p> Pulchritudinous dances like a tiny blue flame beneath a desert sun . It rises above desert sage , skimming like a splendid little bird . It bounces playful . It dives , circles , and sports around us as it seeks a destination . It finally heads out in the general direction of Tennessee . It 's gon na have one whale of a hard time making it in Nashville , but at least it 's free of Reno . <p> " What is the difference ? " Pork murmurs , " between Storyland and The Strip . " He 's talking , of course , about the Reno Strip . <p> " Us , " Victoria says quietly . <p> I know what she means . Of course , Victoria is crazy , even if she does have smart brains . I search across the desert , but nothing out there moves . It looks like we 've pulled off a successful stunt , but a day will come when someone spots us . Scary thought , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even any jail sentence , will allow The Corporation to reclaim Pulchritudinous . <p> " Time to get back to Weird Row , " I tell my comrades . " We still got to deal with Mendelssohn . " <p> Author Affiliation
