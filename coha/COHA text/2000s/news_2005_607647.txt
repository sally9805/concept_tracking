<p> Antonio Brown trudged off the field at Redskins Park after a recent practice , disappearing behind the offensive linemen who sauntered a few yards ahead of him . When Brown stopped to sign autographs for fans , many in the crowd towered over him . <p> At 5 feet 9 and 170 pounds , Brown often has been the shortest player on his team , whether it was at Miami 's Central High , West Virginia University , the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League or the Buffalo Bills . <p> But there 's one group that Brown has no problem looking squarely in the eye  --  some of his fellow Redskins wide receivers . Starters Santana Moss and David Patten are each generously listed at 5-10 and approximately 190 pounds . <p> " It 's funny because every place I went , in high school , college , my first year at Buffalo , I was the little guy . Now , I 'm normal , " said Brown , who led the Redskins ' wideouts with three catches for 37 yards in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one big guy "  --  Darnerien McCants is 6-3 , 214 pounds . " So it 's a lot of little guys , and that helps us a lot , because it 's a great deal of confidence to have that many . <p> " I 'm pretty sure Coach Joe Gibbs sees something that he wants , to have that many 5-10-and-under guys . " <p> Gibbs hopes the smallish , speedy receivers will supply something the offense lacked last season : big plays . That was n't much in evidence in the loss to the Panthers with Moss , McCants and Patten combining to catch four passes for 36 yards . Gibbs envisions receivers stretching the field , enabling his ball-control system to thrive behind tailback Clinton Portis with occasional play-action passes . " You 've got these three midgets who can fly , " Portis said , " so it 's going to open a lot of stuff up . " <p> During Gibbs 's first head coaching tenure ( 1981-1992 ) , he won three Super Bowls in four appearances with help from smaller receivers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Posse " in the late ' 80s . <p> " Receivers come in all sizes and packages , " Gibbs said . " As receivers , I 've had Art Monk at 6-3 ; he 's a big guy . I had Gary Clark ; he 's a small guy . It was terrific . <p> " I 've had Pro Bowlers in all categories there . And I think it depends on how good the guy is . If he 's explosive and can make big plays for us , I 've found that size is negated . " <p> Last season , with starters Rod Gardner ( 6-2 , 213 ) and Laveranues Coles ( 5-11 , 193 ) , Gibbs 's offense finished ranked 30th among 32 teams , averaging only 15 points per game . Receivers caught only four passes of 40 yards or longer , averaged 11.4 yards per catch and scored only six touchdowns . <p> Instead of focusing on size , Gibbs chose to pursue players with the ability to stretch the field . Last season with the New York Jets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchdowns and averaged 18.6 yards per catch , second-best in the NFL . Patten  --  who won three Super Bowl rings in four years with the New England Patriots  --  nipped at Moss 's heels with an 18.2-yard average and scored seven touchdowns , a career high and tied for the team lead . <p> Moss 's career average of 16 yards per catch  --  plus one touchdown every 7.9 receptions  --  is among the best in the NFL . Patten , a ninth-year veteran , has a career average of 14.9 yards per catch . Still , their size bucks a trend in the league . <p> The prototypical NFL receiver has a combination of size , speed and strength . Randy Moss of the Oakland Raiders is 6-4 and weighs 210 pounds ; Terrell Owens of the Philadelphia Eagles is 6-3 , 226 . And although they are unique talents , NFL wideouts appear to be getting bigger and faster with each draft . Of the six receivers selected in the first round of April 's draft , only one was under 6-2 : The 5-11 , 187-pound Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore Ravens ) as teams went for bulkier receivers such as the 6-3 , 208-pound Braylon Edwards ( Michigan ) , chosen third overall by the Cleveland Browns . <p> " Some teams have always wanted bigger receivers . San Francisco does n't mind giving up speed for some size , " said Houston Texans General Manager Charley Casserly , Gibbs 's GM from 1989 to 1992 . Casserly drafted Andre Johnson , a 6-3 , 219-pound wide receiver , with the third overall pick for Houston in 2003 . " But for other teams like the Rams , speed is number one . It depends on the philosophy . " <p> Patten noted that the Patriots established a dynasty with no receiver taller than 6 feet and that Deion Branch ( 5-9 , 193 ) was Super Bowl MVP in February . <p> " We were just a bunch of small guys that got a lot of production on the field , " said Patten , New England 's number two receiver for most of its championship run . " Everybody always focused on our size . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like we had one of the best corps in the league . And you saw the end result . " <p> When Gibbs spoke to Patten about joining the Redskins , the coach said that size was n't an issue , and mentioned some of his former receivers . " He brought up Mr. Sanders and all those guys , " Patten recalled . <p> In the late 1980s , the Posse starred Monk , the 5-9 Clark and 5-11 Ricky Sanders . Monk , who once held the NFL 's all-time record for catches  --  stood out among the group at 6-3 and 210 pounds . In 1989 , three Washington receivers each had more than 1,000 receiving yards . Monk  --  a physical , possession pass-catcher  --  ended his career with the most receiving yards in team history . Clark and Sanders  --  explosive players  --  finished third and fifth overall , respectively . <p> McCants was a Posse fan while growing up in Gambrills . " I 'm the Art Monk of the group , " McCants said . " Each style of receiver has a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a possession-style receiver , going across the middle and taking the punishment . " <p> Like Monk , McCants towers over his fellow wideouts . And the size disparity has been an adjustment . " He looks at us and says , ' Hey man , I 'm bigger than all of y'all , ' " Brown said . " He looks kind of funny standing around us . " <p> McCants and the 6-2 , 212-pound Kevin Dyson appear to be competing for the role of Washington 's big receiver . ( Reserve wideouts Taylor Jacobs , 6-0 , 198 , and James Thrash , 6-0 , 200 , are virtually ensured roster spots . ) But Gibbs said that he does n't necessarily have a spot reserved for a big receiver . <p> Before the Posse , the Smurfs helped Gibbs win the Super Bowl after the 1982 season and reach the title game the following year . In 1983 , the Smurfs were led by the 5-10 Charlie Brown and also included Virgil Seay ( 5-8 , 175 pounds ) and Alvin Garrett ( 5-7 , 178 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 541 points ; Brown caught 78 passes for 1,255 yards with eight touchdowns . <p> The illegal contact rule helps receivers such as Moss and Patten . Before the 2004 season , the NFL placed an emphasis on enforcing the rule against bumping or grabbing a receiver five yards beyond the line of scrimmage . " In the old days , " Redskins wide receivers coach Stan Hixon said , " they were grabbing you down the field and throwing you down and all kinds of things . " <p> Cornerback Shawn Springs said that he has more difficulty defending against small receivers , but sees two main drawbacks . " You have to have a quarterback who can find them because they are not big targets , " Springs said , " and they have to be able to hold up . The league is a physical league . " <p> It helps to have big receivers for fade routes , essentially a jump ball thrown toward the back of the end zone . But Gibbs generally does n't employ a fade in his offense . <p> Bigger receivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best receivers at avoiding jams tend to be small and speedy , forcing defensive backs to give them extra space . At training camp , defenders have been giving Moss a substantial cushion that he uses for intermediate catches . <p> Antonio Brown , who appears to have a roster spot as the lead punt returner , also might contribute as a receiver . He has improved his route running since last season  --  and does n't give his size a second thought . <p> " The minus is people doubt you and the plus is proving ' em wrong , " Brown said . " An advantage is them not knowing our strengths and our ability , and what we have in the total package . "
