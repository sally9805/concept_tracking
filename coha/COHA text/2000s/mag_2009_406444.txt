All are welcome ? I really enjoyed " Tough love " ( April ) . Children with disabilities and the church is a subject I seldom see covered in magazines . I know many people with handicapped children , and many do n't feel welcome in churches of any denomination . I have seen many mentally handicapped people at Mass who are well behaved . My 27-year-old daughter is not one of them . People do n't always understand that " developmentally delayed " includes not only intelligence but also social skills , behavior , emotional control , and modesty . And some people with developmental disabilities are not afraid to say exactly what they think because it does n't even enter their minds that they could be hurting someone else 's feelings- even though they themselves are often easily hurt . My experience with my parish has been wonderful , and everyone is very understanding . They are generous in their praise of my daughter coming to church and ask about her when she is n't there . To all of you who do support us parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathleen Carter Lombard , Ill . We have a child who has a developmental disability . Our experience with the church is , for the most part , as follows : The priests and the older parishioners act as though we parents must have committed some grave sin and that God punished us by giving us a child with a disability . Accordingly , they shun us . What about the younger parishioners ? There are not many younger parishioners ! Dennis O'Brien Lake Forest , Ill . Keeping kids Catholic I read " Parental guidance suggested " ( Expert Witness , April ) eager to hear Sean Reynolds ' suggestions for raising adolescent Catholics . Our family has made our Catholic community the center of our lives . Our teenage daughters have experienced children 's liturgy , Catholic school , and various social justice projects . Though I feel we can always do more , I think they have witnessed parents who have faith and live faith . But the interview with Reynolds did not touch on the key issues my kids have with the church . They do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homosexuality , and women priests , and they can not allow themselves to be part of an organization that takes the positions the church does on these issues . Although we are hurt that they no longer want to participate with us , I commend them for standing up for what they believe and not just following along when they truthfully could not accept these teachings . The practices brought to our attention by this interview are excellent , but I think we would all like the church to address some of these issues in a different light Ana Bailie Atlanta , Ga . As I viewed " 5 Questions with Sean Reynolds " on uscatholic.org , it occurred to me that much of what Reynolds advocates in rethinking our approach to adolescent faith formation involves getting families involved . That idea fits nicely into the U.S. bishops ' initiatives on reaching adolescents . Rebecca Titford Director of Religious Education Archdiocese of Mobile , Ala . All in the family I look forward to reading U.S. Catholic each month . In the April issue I was glad to see the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cinderella story " ) . I have been acquainted with her for many years : I was named Germaine after my grandmother . With regard to " Let them just eat cake " ( Sounding Board , April ) , Linda Zwicky makes a salient point about over-the-top birthday parties . I would like to see less fanfare and outrageous spending on children 's First Communion parties as well . In my family , they have crossed all bounds , including the rental of country club halls , and sometimes remind me of wedding receptions . There , too , it seems as if God is left out of the celebration . In the Feedback section , I was saddened by the remarks of Mike Lewis of Pensacola , Florida : " Let 's not put religion with birthdays ! Let the kids have a good time . " I wrote in the margin of the magazine , " As if they were mutually exclusive ! " God should n't be excluded from the celebration of his gift of life . Germaine Wieman Houston , Texas Bad Tastes What were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Tastes ( April ) , which featured a company that turns the ashes of the dead into diamonds ? While LifeGem may reflect a new technology , it certainly is not the way Catholics have been taught to reverence our bodies after death . U.S. CATHOLIC should print a strong retraction and set readers straight on the church 's teaching about treatment of the body after death . Margaret Tischio Plantation , Fla . Withhold credit When giving someone such as Gov . Martin O'Malley credit for attempting to abolish the death penalty " . . . because it 's the right thing to do , and therefore I must try " ( Signs of the Times , April ) , some perspective is necessary . O'Malley claims to be a practicing Catholic but considers anything supported by the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party to be the right thing to do . He supports abortion on demand , embryonic stem cell research , and eliminating the statute of limitations for sexual abuse claims on all defendants other than public schools . Fred Koenig Aberdeen , Md . Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can this market be saved ? " March ) was reminiscent of a piece in The Atlantic about 10 years ago titled " The Market as God " by Harvard theologian Harvey Cox . He wrote , " I began to marvel at just how comprehensive the business theology is . There were even sacraments to convey salvific power to the lost , a calendar of entrepreneurial saints , and what theologians call an ' eschatology ' - teaching about the ' end of history . ' " The " end " came with an administration that engaged in unfettered acts of aggression and permitted unregulated corporate greed - with Catholic support because it promised an anti-abortion Supreme Court At the same time bad situations can have positive outcomes . Perhaps this crisis will curtail our appetite for unhealthy foods , SUVs , oversized homes , and so forth . Finn was right in saying , " God 's intention in creating the goods of the earth was to meet everybody 's needs , " to which I might add , some- but only some- of their wants .
