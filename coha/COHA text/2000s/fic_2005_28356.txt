My feet hurt . The nightmare still in my head , I walk across the cold wood floor , shuffling my feet in the light grit . I 'm half-drunk and I have to pee . I 'm not sure which woke me , the piss or the nightmare . My john is just a bit smaller than the average port-o-potty . I sit on the pot and rest my forehead against the opposite wall . I have a pee hard-on and if I try to take a leak standing up , I 'll end up hosing the whole can . I know this from experience . Plus my feet still hurt . It takes a while . By the time I finish I 'm just about asleep again . I get up , flush , and shuffle back to bed . On the way , a last bit of piss dribbles onto my thigh . I pick up a dirty sock from the floor , wipe the urine off and toss the sock in a corner . I crawl back under the covers and twist around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back asleep and the nightmare begins to rise up again in my mind . I force myself fully awake to keep it from getting back in . I think happy thoughts . I think about a dog I used to have . I think about Yvonne . I think about baseball : long , lazy games of baseball , plastic cups of cold beer between my thighs , peanut shells crunching beneath my sneakers . Fly balls soaring over loping outfielders . The beautiful ease of the long pop fly out . . . No ! Wrong ! Baseball is a mistake and the nightmare is rushing back in . I think about home . Home does the trick and I start to ease back asleep . And only then as I finally fall asleep do I register the blood I saw on the sock when I wiped my leg , the blood from my piss . I sleep . * * * These things are not related : my aching feet , the nightmare , the blood . My feet have hurt for years because ofthe job . The nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood in my piss is brand new , but I know exactly where I got that too . I got the bloody piss from the beating I took from a couple of guys last night . By last night I mean a few long hours before the nightmare woke me up . And when I say I took a beating from these guys , I really mean they gave it to me . Free . I got lucky ; they both had small hands . Go figure , two big guys with small hands . It happens . They did n't want to bust up those little hands working on my face , so they gave it to my body . It did n't take long . They put some good ones in my gut and ribs and I dropped . Then I took a couple boot shots in the kidneys . That 's where the blood is coming from . The alarm goes off at 8:00 a.m . Now that the booze has worn off I hurt everywhere , but my feet are what 's really killing me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I brush my teeth and hop in the shower . Bruises are starting to well up all over my torso and the hot water feels good . I leave the shower running and walk dripping to the fridge , grab a cold beer and take it back to the shower . The water feels good , but the beer is better . It takes the edge off my hangover , kicks up the dust of last night 's drunk and gives it life . I take the washcloth from the shower caddie and gently scrub my feet . Out of the shower now , I finish the last of the beer while trimming my toenails . I clip them very short and even and make sure there is no grit hiding at the edges . I find a clean pair of socks with no holes and get dressed . I head out the front door . There 's time for breakfast . At the diner I have bacon and eggs and another beer . The first beer was good , but the second is even better . I 'm heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first couple drinks of the day are always the best . I have to ease into it with beer because my job starts late . If I hit it too early I 'll be drooling by the time the shift begins . I sip the beer , eat my chow , and look over the sports pages . As a rule , the Daily News consists of equal parts violent sensationalism , feel-good human interest , celebrity gossip and advertising . I read it every day and feel dirty all over . But it 's New York , and everybody gets dirty sooner or later . Today it 's all election coverage and stories about yet more dotcoms biting the dust . I flip past the photos of the interchangeable candidates and get to the important stuff . See , the reason I started buying this rag in the first place is because it 's the only way to get West Coast scores in the morning . Unless you have cable . I ca n't afford cable . Back in California , the Giants are suffering their usual late season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first place . But after a seven-game skid , they 've been eliminated from contention for the division and are trailing the Mets for the wild card by four games with eight games left in the season . Meanwhile the Dodgers are red hot and have the division clinched after winning twelve of their last fourteen . I look at my watch and it 's time to go see the doctor . I hate the Dodgers . I 've had this appointment for a week . I 'm not here about the blood , I 'm here about my feet . I 've tried every kind of shoe and insert I can find and my feet are still killing me . So now , after years of bitch- ing , I 'm finally seeing a doctor . I could ask about the blood while I 'm here , but what the hell is he gon na tell me ? He 's gon na tell me to go to an emergency room and they 're gon na tell me that it 's not life-threatening . They 're gon na charge me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest a bit and not to drink alcohol or caffeine . I do n't drink caffeine . It makes me jittery . I sit in the waiting room and think about that second beer and how good it was . I 'm not worried about the kidney . If the kidney was serious , I 'd be unconscious by now . It 's contused : my kidney is scraped and it 's bleeding a bit . Dr. Bob comes out of his office and calls my name . Dr. Bob is a great guy . He 's an Ivy League med school graduate who came to the Lower East Side and opened a community practice . He 'll take anybody as a patient insurance or no insurance , his rates are as low as they get , and you pay your bills whenever you can . All of which suits my situation . He told me once he did n't want to make people healthy just to make them poor . Like I said , a great guy . I told him about the feet a week ago and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his tiny office , he turns from where the X rays are clipped to one of those light things on the wall and sits on the stool in front of me . He starts to look at my feet . He really takes his time , inspecting them . He holds each foot , first one and then the other , and kneads a bit , searching for some imperfection . All the while , he directs his eyes upward , as if they might interfere with the examination : a safecracker with his eyes shut . Doc ? Shhh . He squeezes my feet a few more times , then stands up . He 's talking now , but I 'm having trouble hearing what he 's saying . He 's gesturing from my feet to the X rays . I 'm thinking about getting out of here and drinking my next beer . I 'm thinking how I wish I were lying down right now because I feel a little strange . He is looking at me oddly . The roaring in my ears is not the hangover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that something must be wrong . The examining table spins out from underneath me and I thump to the floor . I try to lift myself up , but I ca n't . I feel a warm wetness spreading over my lap and down my legs . I can see the tops of my feet . I can see the tips my three-hundred-dollar sneakers that are supposed to be the most comfortable things that money can buy but are not . And I can see the bloody urine trickling out the cuffs of my jeans . Something is very wrong . I sleep . This is how life changes . You 're born in California and raised as an only child in a pleasant suburb a ways east of San Francisco . You have a nice childhood with parents who love you . You play baseball . You are tremendously gifted at the game and you love it . By the time you are seventeen you have a room full of trophies . You have played on two teams that have competed for the Little League World Series and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad . You 're a four-tool player : bat , glove , arm , and legs . You play center field . You lead the team in homers , ERA , RBI , stolen bases , and have no errors . Pro scouts have been coming to see you play all year and when you graduate , everyone expects you will skip college to be signed for development by a Major League club . At every game you look into the stands and your parents are always there . In the regional championship game you are caught stealing third . You slide hard into the bag as the third baseman leaps to snare a high throw from the plate . Your cleats dig into the bottom of the base and as you pop up out of your slide , the third baseman is coming down with the ball . He lands on the ankle of your caught foot and , as you continue up , he falls down with his full weight on your lower leg . The bone sticks straight out from your calf , and you just stare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth in the bone . It will not heal properly and for the rest of your life you have a hard knot of scar and bundled muscle tissue that aches in cold , wet weather . No one even pretends you will play again . You stay away from the games and do n't see much of your old friends . You have new friends , and you get in a little trouble . You work after school and buy a Mustang and fix it up with your dad , the mechanic . You drive everywhere and drag all the local motor-heads . You always win . When there 's no one around to race , you drive fast on the back roads outside of town and get a rush from the speed . It 's not baseball , but it 's something . Out by the cattle ranches , after midnight , a calf wanders into the road through a split in the fence . You swerve and pound down on the brake pedal . The wheel crazes out of your hand and the car heels down on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bites into the tarmac and the car flips up and begins to sail end over end . You are suspended in the car , held tight to the seat by the four-point harness your dad insisted you install . The car tumbles through the air and passes harmlessly over the calf . The Ford completes a full revolution , lands on its bottom , careens across the road and slams its front end into an oak . Your friend Rich does not have his seat belt on . When you first saw the calf and slammed the brakes , Rich was kneeling on his seat , turned around and rummaging in the back for a sweatshirt . During the flip you are for a moment suspended upside down . Rich bounces around the interior of the car and falls to the roof , sprawled on his back . He is looking at you , into your eyes , his face less than a foot away , inches away . The car flips with sudden violence , Rich disappears from your vision , and as you plow into the tree he appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He launches through the glass and flies the short distance to where the oak catches him brutally . Lots of people show up at the funeral and cry and hug you . You have a bruised sternum and a cut on your cheek , and you look no one in the eye . Afterward your parents take you home . In the spring you graduate and in the fall go to college in Northern California . You think about being a physical therapist or an EMT . You think about teaching like your mom . You wo n't go to work in your dad 's garage . You do n't want to work on cars anymore . You do n't even drive . You never graduate . You go to college for six years and study a bit of everything and do well at all of it , but you never graduate . You 're not sure what to do and then you meet a girl . She 's an actress . You show up in New York with your girl and the two of you stay on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the city , she gets a job on the road and leaves . The friend tells you that you have to move out . New York has great public transportation . You never have to drive . You decide to stay . You find an apartment the size of your folks ' kitchen . You get a job tending bar . For the first time in your life you start drinking . You 're good at it . You live in New York , but you always act like a guy from a small town in California . You help winos out of the gutter , you call an ambulance when you see someone hurt , you loan money to friends who need it and do n't ask for it back , you let folks flop at your pad and you help the blind across the street . One night you go to break up a fight in the bar and get knocked around pretty good , so the next day you start taking boxing classes . You drink too much , but your parents do n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have a reputation in your neighborhood for helping people out . It 's nice . It 's not the life you expected , but it 's nice enough for you . You feel useful , you have friends and your parents love you . Ten years pass . One day the guy who lives across the hall from you knocks on your door . He needs a big favor . That 's when life really changes . When I wake up , the first thing I think about is the fucking cat . I 'm looking after this guy 's cat for a couple weeks . God knows how long I 've been out and if the thing is even alive . Fuck ! I knew this would happen . I told the guy I was n't good with animals , that I can barely take care of myself , but he was really up against it , so I took the damn cat . Then I see I 'm in the hospital and figure out I may have more important things to worry about . A joke : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life feeling like a freak . Boys make fun of him in gym class , girls laugh at him . Finally , he ca n't take it and goes to have one of them lopped off . The doctor takes one look and tells the guy no way , it 's too dangerous , might kill him or something , but he sends him to a shrink who might help out . This counselor or whatever he is tells the guy to take it easy , he should be proud of this third ball , he 's special . I mean , how many guys have three testicles , right ? So the guy feels great after that . He leaves the doc 's office , walks into the street , goes up to the first man he sees and says , " Did you know , between you and me we 've got five balls ? " This dude looks at him funny and says , " You mean you only have one ? " First guy I see when I walk out of the hospital I go up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me we only have three kidneys ? He does n't say anything , just walks around me like I 'm not there . New York , baby , New York . I 've been in the hospital for six days : one unconscious and five conscious . The doctors removed the kidney , which had been nearly ruptured by the two big guys with four small hands and further damaged by my negligence and massive consumption of diuretic liquids . Booze . The kidney was at " four plus " when they took it out . At " five , " they simply explode and kill you . I have been told that I should never again consume alcohol in any amount for the rest of my life on pain of death . Likewise no smoking or caffeine . I do n't smoke and , like I said , caffeine makes me jittery . After I blacked out , Dr. Bob called the EMTs and had them take me to Beth Israel . He rode with me in the ambulance and when we arrived he got me past all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saved my life . One of the doctors told me all of this and when Bob showed up I tried to thank him , but he waved it off in a just-doing-my-job kind of way . Then we get to my feet . So , your condition is chronic and brought on by the amount of time you spend on your feet at work . I 'm a bartender . I work a ten-hour shift five nights a week . Sometimes six or seven nights . You could buy a lifetime supply of Dr. Scholl 's and get your feet massaged every night and it would not help . If you want the pain to go away , you are going to have to get off your feet . What if I ? Off your feet . You 're like a computer worker with carpal tunnel : if you want it to go away , you are going to have to change your work habits forever . Wow . Yes , wow . Furthermore , the pain in your feet has been exacerbated by poor circulation , which I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . So stop drinking . Period . Yeah , sounds good . And that was that . He told me good luck and was on his way out when I asked about the bill . When you get a new job and you 've paid off your bill here , we 'll talk about money . A great guy . Booze and my kidney . Booze and my feet . A pattern emerging . I called the bar and talked to Edwin , the guy who owns the place . I apologized for the lack of notice , but Edwin was cool and just told me not to be a stranger . Would I have quit if it was just the booze and the kidney ? If someone said , " Get away from the booze and the drinking life or you 're gon na die , " would I have quit ? I do n't know , but my feet are killing me and that tears it . I called my folks , made sure they knew I was OK and told them not to come out or expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , but I made her laugh in the end , telling her the testicle joke . Dad asked if I needed money and I said no . We talked about Christmas a bit and how long I 'd stay when I come out and then I told them I love them and they told me they love me and we hung up and I just fucking stared at the ceiling for a while . I called one of the other bartenders from work . Her name is Yvonne , we used to see each other quite a bit , still do from time to time . So she 's a girl I see from time to time . She 's more than that . She 's my best friend . But I also see her from time to time . She has a key to my place , so I told her about the cat and she promised to check on it until I got home . She offered to come by the hospital , but I said no . I want to be alone . I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
