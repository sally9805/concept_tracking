<p> From a purely stylistic point of view , " The House That Rocked " and " Parade "  --  two of the strongest musical offerings now on Chicago stages  --  are radically different . Yet both shows are deeply rooted in this country 's history and , to some extent , their roots are even intertwined . Each tells a tale that could only be categorized as being deep " in the American grain . " And each , in their own way , suggests the way prejudice can undermine lives . <p> The Black Ensemble Theater 's new production , " The House That Rocked , " is a zesty look at the careers of three of rock ' n ' roll 's founding fathers  --  Fats Domino , Chuck Berry and Little Richard . Held together by the thinnest of narrative threads , it keeps you riveted , thanks to the three actor-singers who portray the stars and re-create their repertoire to marvelous effect . <p> Bailiwick Repertory 's production of " Parade " is a large-scale ensemble effort with a meticulously stitched book and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2000 . The show never made it to Chicago during its short-lived national tour . But this production , so successful in its initial run at Bailiwick , was recently transferred for a limited engagement at the Mercury Theatre . And its tight musical storytelling and sharply etched characters  --  a weave of history , courtroom drama and love story  --  engages you on many levels . <p> THEATER REVIEW <p> ' THE HOUSE THAT ROCKED ' <p> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED <p> When : Through July 25 <p> Where : Black Ensemble Theater , 4520 N. Beacon <p> Tickets : $32.50 <p> Call : ( 773 ) 769-4451 <p> It is 1986 and preparations are under way at New York 's Waldorf Astoria Hotel for the induction of the first members into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Gathered in the green room and waiting for sound checks are Fats Domino ( John Steven Crowley ) , Chuck Berry ( Kenn E. Head ) and Little Richard ( Tony Duwon ) . It 's the perfect excuse for the men to reminisce , mull over their personal crises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , best of all , plunge into performances of their greatest hits . <p> That 's the essential framework of " The House That Rocked , " a show written by David Barr III ( in collaboration with Black Ensemble producer Jackie Taylor ) and directed by Ilesa Duncan . And what more do you really need when you 've got more than two dozen irresistible 1950s rock standards to keep things moving , with a little extra help from a many-faced muse-seductress ( the beautiful Andrea Wukitsch , who dances like a dream and skillfully travels from mythic figure to modern trouble woman ) ? <p> Though quite different in their personalities and personal histories , the three musicians portrayed here are united by their tales of tough times on the road , money lost and found , painful episodes in their various emotional and sexual histories and , first and foremost  --  and most joyfully , as well as competitively  --  by their musical prowess . <p> Fats Domino is the New Orleans-bred singer and pianist who outsold every ' 50s rock pioneer except Elvis Presley . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band were killed in a van accident during a particularly grueling period on the road necessitated by his gambling problems . You can hear the sadness when Crowley sings " Blue Monday , " yet the life-force is in full gear when he launches into " Jambalaya , " " Hello , Josephine " or the sweet and mellow " Blueberry Hill . " <p> Chuck Berry , the St. Louis-bred musician whose guitar playing and blend of blues and country sounds were hugely influential to both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , spent two years in federal prison for transporting a minor across state lines and left jail both embittered and destined to have many more encounters with the police , the courts and the IRS . But there is nothing sad or blue about Head 's rendition of " Reelin ' &; Rockin ' , " " Maybellene " or " Roll Over Beethoven . " And even if a subplot about an attempt to plant drugs on him on the very evening of the Hall of Fame ceremony suggests that it will always be " the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules . <p> And then there 's Little Richard  --  with his wild falsetto , his pounding piano style , the fake eyelashes and pompadour that made him a model of sexual ambiguity and naughtiness . He may have had father problems , unlikely spiritual epiphanies and all the rest , but his music seemed to come from some great thundercloud in the sky . And in what is unquestionably a breakthrough performance for Duwon , the actor creates a storm of his own . Not only does he set things on fire with such songs as " Keep a Knockin ' , " " I 'm Ready , " " Jenny , Jenny , " " Tutti Frutti " and " Good Golly , Miss Molly "  --  radiating the same kind of crazy megawatt energy that was Little Richard 's trademark  --  but he also suggests a believable person behind the wildman . It is a pleasure to see a performer come into his own . <p> The band rocks , too  --  with Robert Reddrick leading Derrick Bounds , Tracy Baker , James Wheeler , Paul Howard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this summer . <p> THEATER REVIEW <p> ' PARADE ' <p> RECOMMENDED <p> When : Through July 18 <p> Where : Bailiwick Repertory at the Mercury Theatre , 3745 N. Southport <p> Tickets : $30-$40 <p> Call : ( 773 ) 325-1700 <p> ' Parade , " the creation of Alfred Uhry ( " Driving Miss Daisy " ) and Jason Robert Brown ( " The Last Five Years " ) , takes us to Atlanta in 1913 . This is still very much the " Old South , " as Confederate Army veterans continue to smolder with resentment , and lynchings are a not uncommon alternative to a justice system still rooted in corruption and racism . <p> The musical is based on the true story of Leo Frank ( played here by the thin , intense Nicholas Foster ) , a Brooklyn Jew who moved to Atlanta to manage his uncle 's pencil factory  --  a place where where poor young teenage girls worked on the assembly line because child labor laws were hardly a local priority . A smart , serious , nervous man , Frank is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his wife , Lucille ( the clarion-voiced Amy Arbizzani ) , a wholly assimilated Southern Jew he married two years earlier . But he is like a fish out of water  --  homesick , wary and uneasy , even prudish , in his relations with his wife . <p> When Mary Phagan ( the apple-faced Amber Robbin ) is found murdered in his factory 's basement , the worst aspects of the society are unleashed . The politicians sense that the city is too enraged to settle for the hanging of " just another black man , " although they could easily pin the blame on a night watchman . Instead , they frame Frank  --  the Yankee , the Jew , the outsider , the interloper . And it is left to Lucille , who is emboldened and strangely liberated by the challenge of saving her husband , to seek justice . In the process , she and Leo ( very much like the husband and wife in Stephen Sondheim 's " Into the Woods " ) find the connection and trust that has long been missing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of months ago , my colleague Mary Houlihan eloquently observed : " In the best American musical tradition ( ' Show Boat , ' ' Ragtime ' ) , Brown 's songs are a captivating mix of hymns , folk , blues , jazz and ragtime . Rarely do such songs send a shiver down the spine as these do . The lyrics reveal the explosive depths of a deep-seated racism set deep in the American psyche . It is truly an unsettling experience . " <p> Under David Zaks ' direction , the young but highly skilled cast of 30 ( in itself a major coup for a small Off-Loop operation ) creates a powerful group portrait with choral singing of great beauty . And there are especially fine portrayals by Jamie Axtell as the slick and dirty prosecuting attorney ; Rus Rainear as the sincere but incompetent defense attorney ; Sean Reid as the opportunistic reporter who does a hallucinatory vaudeville turn when the story breaks ; Brannen Daugherty as Mary 's slightly overzealous would-be boyfriend , and Gerald Richardson , a galvanic performer , as the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank has never been entirely resolved , and this production might have injected just a bit more ambiguity and doubt into the mix . Yet in all other ways , this is a bold and moving production that makes the case for " Parade " having a prominent place in the American musical theater archives .
