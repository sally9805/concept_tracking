The dust has barely settled since the Tyco jury was sent home after a mistrial was declared . I was Juror No. 11 , and I 'm not at all sure how I feel . Numb , mostly . Disappointed . Angry . Could I really have just spent six months of my life on one of the signature corporate-fraud cases of the Wall Street bubble only to have the judge rule that it must be started again from scratch , like some do-over in a childhood kickball game ? How did it come to this ? <P> I was n't sure what to expect back on Sept. 29 when potential jurors shuttled across lower Manhattan 's Centre Street for jury selection . Along the way , one man asked a court officer if it was for the Kozlowski case . As a writer-reporter for SPORTS ILLUSTRATED , I wondered whether Atlanta Falcons tight end Brian Kozlowski had got into a legal scrape . Of course , the defendants were actually Dennis Kozlowski , the CEO of Tyco International , and ex-CFO Mark Swartz . Through a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two built Tyco into a $36 billion conglomerate and made themselves exceedingly wealthy in the process . <P> I was shocked when I was placed on the panel , since I 'd once worked as an investment banker . I did n't think the prosecution would want a juror who had been active on Wall Street during a go-go era and might well see nothing wrong with fat bonuses and lavish parties for men generating great wealth for the company . I certainly did not enter the case with a vendetta against the defendants , who were accused of taking tens of millions of dollars in unauthorized bonuses and essentially using Tyco assets as a giant piggy bank to fund their lavish lifestyles . In fact , their whole defense was that whatever money they took to fund their spending habits , they took with the board 's knowledge and consent . They pleaded greedy but not guilty . <P> The prosecution 's case was that these men lied to , cheated and stole from investors and directors . But prosecutors made a major miscalculation in spending so much time putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and video of the now famous $2 million bash Kozlowski threw in Sardinia for his wife that featured singer Jimmy Buffett and of his over-the-top purchases of items like $6,000 shower curtains . These seemed to be the activities that most titillated the media , judging by the marked jump in attendance on those days of testimony in an otherwise boring trial . But the jury spent almost no time during deliberations on those topics , and rightfully so . Much of what these two men did might have been unseemly , even unethical  --  but illegal beyond a reasonable doubt ? Not to us . Instead , several jury members expressed disgust that the prosecution had wasted our time on all this . The case was supposed to last three months , but it stretched on and on , through 48 witnesses , more than 700 exhibits and 12,000-plus pages of testimony . Eventually , some jurors essentially tuned out , and , really , it was hard to blame them .                   @ @
