M O N D A Y <br> <br> <p> OUT OF PLACE . <p> The California Highway Patrol trooper , young with bristly yellow hair beneath his crisp hat , squinted through the windshield of his Crown Victoria Police Interceptor as he cruised south along Highway 1 in Monterey . Dunes to the right , modest commercial sprawl to the left . <p> Something was out of place . What ? <p> Heading home at 5:00 p.m. after his tour had ended , he surveyed the road . The trooper didn'twrite a lot of tickets here , leaving that to the county deputies  --  professional courtesy  --  but he occasionally lit up somebody in a German or Italian car if he was in a mood , and this was the route he often took home at this time of day , so he knew the highway pretty well . <p> There ... that was it . Something colorful , a quarter mile ahead , sat by the side of the road at the base of one of the hills of sand that cut off the view of Monterey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit his light bar  --  protocol  --  and pulled over onto the right shoulder . He parked with the hood of the Ford pointed leftward toward traffic , so a rear-ender would shove the car away from , not over , him , and climbed out . Stuck in the sand just beyond the shoulder was a cross  --  a roadside memorial . It was about eighteen inches high and homemade , cobbled together out of dark , broken-off branches , bound with wire like florists use . Dark red roses lay in a splashy bouquet at the base . A cardboard disk was in the center , the date of the accident written on it in blue ink . There were no names on the front or back . <p> Officially these memorials to traffic accident victims were discouraged , since people were occasionally injured , even killed , planting a cross or leaving flowers or stuffed animals . <p> Usually the memorials were tasteful and poignant . This one was spooky . <p> What was odd , though , was that he could n't remember any accidents along here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Highway 1 in California . The roadway becomes an obstacle course south of Carmel , like that spot of a really sad accident several weeks ago : two girls killed coming back from a graduation party . But here , the highway was three lanes and mostly straight , with occasional lazy bends through the old Fort Ord grounds , now a college , and the shopping districts . <p> The trooper thought about removing the cross , but the mourners might return to leave another one and endanger themselves again . Best just to leave it . Out of curiosity he 'd check with his sergeant in the morning and find out what had happened . He walked back to his car , tossed his hat on the seat and rubbed his crew cut . He pulled back into traffic , his mind no longer on roadside accidents . He was thinking about what his wife would be making for supper , about taking the kids to the pool afterward . <p> And when was his brother coming to town ? He looked at the date window on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at his cell phone confirmed that , yes , today was June 25 . <p> That was curious . Whoever had left the roadside cross had made a mistake . He remembered that the date crudely written on the cardboard disk was June 26 , Tuesday , tomorrow . <p> Maybe the poor mourners who 'd left the memorial had been so upset they 'd jotted the date down wrong . <p> Then the images of the eerie cross faded , though they didn'tvanish completely and , as the officer headed down the highway home , he drove a bit more carefully . <p> Copyright 2009 by Jeffrey Deaver <br> Continues ...
