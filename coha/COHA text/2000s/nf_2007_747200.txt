The University of West Georgia , one of several educational institutions originating from legislation establishing agricultural and mechanical schools throughout the state , celebrates its centennial in 2006-2007 . Inspired by a 1902 proposal by Gov . Joseph Terrell , the Georgia General Assembly passed the Perry Bill in 1906 , envisioning economic growth through a citizenry trained in modern agricultural methods . The act established an agricultural and mechanical school in each congressional district to be supported by fertilizer , oil , and other inspection fees collected through the State Department of Agriculture. ( n1 ) Tuition would be free and students could earn up to one hundred dollars per year once half of the school 's revenue from the sale of crops was set aside for operational costs . Students would perform the agricultural and mechanical work associated with operating the schools , and housing would be provided to those who lived beyond commuting distance. ( n2 ) <p> The state engaged architect Haralson Bleckley to develop a plan for the schools . Bleckley designed a central building to hold administrative offices and classrooms , flanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one for girls . This plan was used at nine of the schools , including the institutions now known as Georgia Southwestern State University in Americus , South Georgia College in Douglas , Georgia Southern University in Statesboro , and the University of West Georgia in Carrollton. ( n3 ) <p> The fourth congressional district stretched along the state 's western boundary from Carroll County to Muscogee County , the two highest bidders for the proposed school . The contrast between the locations was dramatic , Muscogee being one of the most highly industrialized counties in the state , and Carroll frequently vying with Burke as Georgia 's largest producer of cotton . The act called for a board of trustees to be named by the governor and made up of one representative from each county in the district . On December 8 , 1906 , the board awarded the school location to Carroll County , because of its agricultural roots. ( n4 ) <p> Carroll County 's bid provided $70,000 in start-up funding . Early in 1907 , the old Thomas Bonner plantation , a little more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city supplied lights , water , and sewerage . Despite this support and private funding secured from local citizens as part of the bid for the school , the board could only afford to build the classroom building and one of the two dormitories . The second dormitory was completed in 1916 , after congressman William C. Adamson secured additional funding and made a large personal contribution . The Fourth District Agricultural and Mechanical ( A &M); School opened its doors in January 1908 , with just over a hundred students . During its twenty-five years of operation , students were instructed in agriculture , cotton and poultry production , dairying , home economics , carpentry , and woodworking , as well as in basic English , math , and science. ( n5 ) <p> Georgia 's A &M; schools began to feel increasing competition following passage of a 1912 constitutional amendment permitting state support for public high schools . In 1917 , the Smith Hughes Act passed by the United States Congress brought federal support for the teaching of agriculture and home economics in public high schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1930s , helped bring about the restructuring of the A &M; Schools . In 1931 , Gov . Richard B. Russell proposed a reorganization of the state 's higher education modeled on New York 's university system . The General Assembly approved a plan creating the University System of Georgia to be managed by a Board of Regents authorized to " consolidate , suspend or discontinue institutions , and readjust budgets and allocations . " ( n6 ) <p> The regents found three state-supported institutions in west Georgia , including the Fourth A &M; in Carrollton and Bowdon College , both in Carroll County , and the Seventh A &M; located in Powder Springs in Cobb County , but believed that one junior college would be sufficient for this region . The three schools competed to survive , with the Fourth A &M; being selected and opening as West Georgia College in 1933 . Irvine Sullivan Ingram , who had served for thirteen years as principal of the Fourth A &M,; became president . The college offered two degree programs  --  a normal certificate for students planning to teach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1937 , the faculty approved a grant request to the Chicago-based Julius Rosenwald Fund and began an experimental rural education project that developed linkages to enrich and assist county schools , including those serving African Americans . The college trained teachers , worked with families , and established canning and other cooperatives . Over the course of a decade , the Rosenwald Fund invested nearly a quarter of a million dollars in the project. ( n8 ) <p> Following World War II , writers and educators began searching for outstanding educational programs , and West Georgia 's collaboration with Carroll County schools was highlighted in articles in Look and the Saturday Evening Post in 1946. ( n9 ) Writing in the New York Times , Benjamin Fine used Carroll County 's Tallapoosa School as " an example of what a rural school can do under good guidance . " ( n10 ) Many notable teachers and writers came to West Georgia as part of the Rosenwald Project , including Eva Knox Evans , who created the " Let 's Do it Now " series with titles such as Let 's Plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sky . Marie Campbell , whose important collections of folklore included Cloud Walking , Folks Do Get Born , A House With Stairs , and Tales from the Cloud Walking Country , remained at West Georgia after the project ended. ( n11 ) <p> Outreach efforts of the Rosenwald Project were perhaps an impetus for the college 's rural neighbors to seek assistance supporting those whose formal education had been interrupted or was lacking due to exigencies created by two cataclysmic events : the Depression and World War II . In 1949 , the institution developed College in the Country . Within a decade this initiative reached twenty-one communities in surrounding counties , including some in adjacent Alabama , as well as the Atlanta federal penitentiary , where the program was known as College at the Crossroads . Study nights provided African Americans access to the program during this era of segregation . College in the Country attracted international attention , as visitors from Europe , India , Pakistan , and Iran came to the campus to explore West Georgia 's model for educating rural populations.

In 1960 , President Ingram retired and was succeeded by Dr. William H. Row , who served as president for only nine months before succumbing to a fatal heart attack in 1961 . The subsequent presidency of Dr. James E. Boyd ushered in a decade of dynamic change . Boyd came to West Georgia from Georgia Tech , where he helped develop a nuclear program and was one of the founders of Scientific Atlanta . Throughout the nation , colleges and universities were experiencing enrollment and construction booms , and West Georgia was no exception . As new facilities reshaped West Georgia College , the social changes of the sixties profoundly affected campuses across the nation . Boyd 's views on race , and on student and faculty freedom of expression , were progressive in ways that were not particularly characteristic of a college in a small southern town in that era . In June 1963 , he desegregated West Georgia by recruiting a local black student , Lillian James Williams. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President John E Kennedy devastated the nation . During this juncture , a church formerly used by both Episcopalians and Catholics was moved to campus to serve as an interfaith chapel . Before a crowd of more than one thousand , attorney general Robert E Kennedy dedicated the chapel in honor of his late brother on May 26 , 1964 , saying that " President Kennedy 's administration . advanced the day when the bars of intolerance against all minority groups will be lifted , not only for the Presidency , but for all aspects of our national life . " He called the chapel " a warmly fitting tribute to President Kennedy not only because it bears his name but because it , too , expresses and advances the spirit of tolerance among religions and among men . " ( n14 ) During a question and answer period , Kennedy advocated the passage of the civil rights bill , then under debate in the U.S. Senate . In answering a question on the public accommodations section of the bill , Kennedy said : " That part of the legislation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mississippi and Alabama are not going to do it . Therefore they Negroes are entitled to have the Federal Government do it . " ( n15 ) Kennedy received thunderous applause in response to this and other statements . Attending the ceremony were Ralph McGill and Eugene Patterson of the Atlanta Constitution , Griffin Bell , who was appointed by President Kennedy as judge of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , and Joe Cumming of Newsweek. ( n16 ) <p> Boyd left West Georgia to become Vice Chancellor for Academic Development of the University System in 1971 . The late sixties and early seventies witnessed student unrest and protest over a wide range of issues , and these struggles affected the university 's relationship with the community . West Georgia 's fourth president , Dr. Ward Pafford , grappled with these challenges while extending opportunities for faculty governance through the establishment of a Faculty Senate , and through administrative restructuring . In 1974 , the Braves basketball team under Coach Roger Kaiser won the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics championship , a first for West Georgia. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a political scientist with experience in non-academic areas as well as education , became West Georgia 's fifth president , serving until he died in office in 1993 . During his tenure , former West Georgia history professor Newt Gingrich was elected to Congress , where he assumed the role of Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1995 . Gingrich agreed to donate his papers to West Georgia in 1983 , where they join papers and recorded interviews of state political leaders past and present , including materials associated with Georgia House Speaker Thomas B. Murphy , whose forty-two-year political career ended in 2003 . In 1994 , Dr. Beheruz N. Sethna , a native of India and the first person from an ethnic minority to head a predominantly white or racially integrated educational institution in the state , became the school 's sixth president . In 1996 , the Board of Regents designated a number of the larger colleges in the University System as universities , and the institution became the State University of West Georgia.

The centennial slogan " From Rural Roots to Global Reach " illustrates the university 's growth and progress of the past one hundred years . Grounded in the Progressive idealism of the early twentieth-century South , the institution began as an effort to offer practical educational opportunities to allow young Georgians to succeed in an agrarian society and emerges in its second century grounding twenty-first century students in a liberal arts curriculum that explores global issues , focuses on technology , and develops critical thinking and practical skills that enable its graduates to succeed in today 's society and assume leadership roles in the state , nation , and the world.
