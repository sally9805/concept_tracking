i . The Coven Reconstituted <br> Those of us acquainted with their sordid and scandalous story were not surprised to hear , by way of rumors from the various localities where the sorceresses had settled after fleeing our venerable town of Eastwick , Rhode Island , that the husbands whom the three Godforsaken women had by their dark arts concocted for themselves did not prove durable . Wicked methods make weak products . Satan counterfeits Creation , yes , but with inferior goods . <br> Alexandra , the oldest in age , the broadest in body , and the nearest in character to normal , generous-spirited humanity , was the first to become a widow . Her instinct , as with so many a wife suddenly liberated into solitude , was to travel  --  as if the world at large , by way of flimsy boarding cards and tedious airport delays and the faint but undeniable risk of flight in a time of rising fuel costs , airline bankruptcy , suicidal terrorists , and accumulating metal fatigue , could be compelled to yield the fruitful aggravation of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjured for herself from a hollowed pumpkin , a cowboy hat , and a pinch of Western soil scraped from inside the back fender of a pickup truck with Colorado plates that she had seen parked , looking eerily out of place , on Oak Street in the early 1970s , had , as their marriage settled and hardened , proved difficult to budge from his ceramics studio and little-frequented pottery shop on a side street in Taos , New Mexico . <br> Jim 's idea of a trip had been the hour 's drive south to Santa Fe ; his idea of a holiday was spending a day in one of the Indian reservations  --  Navajo , Zuni , Apache , Acoma , Isleta Pueblo  --  spying out what the Native American potters were offering in the reservation souvenir shops , and hoping to pick up cheap in some dusty Indian Bureau commissary an authentic old black-and-white geometric Pueblo jar or a red-on-buff Hohokam storage jar , with its spiral-and-maze pattern , which he could peddle for a small fortune to a newly endowed museum in one of the burgeoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and Alexandra liked that in him , since she as his wife was part of where he was . She liked his lean build ( a flat stomach to the day he died , and never performed a sit-up in his life ) and the saddle smell of his sweat and the scent of clay that clung , like a sepia aura , to his strong and knowing hands . They had met , on the natural plane , when she , for some time divorced , had taken a course at the Rhode Island School of Design , where he had been enlisted as a fill-in instructor . The four stepchildren  --  Marcy , Ben , Linda , Eric  --  that she saddled him with could n't have asked for a calmer , more soothingly taciturn father-substitute . He was easier for her children  --  half out of the nest in any case , Marcy being all of eighteen  --  to relate to than their own father , Oswald Spofford , a small manufacturer of kitchen fixtures from Norwich , Connecticut . Poor Ozzie had become so earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , not even his children , could take him seriously . <br> People had taken Jim Farlander seriously , women and children especially , giving him back his own coiled silence . His level gray eyes had the glint of a gun from within the shade of his wide-brimmed hat , its crown darkened where his thumb and fingers pinched it . When he was at the pottery wheel he tied a faded blue bandana around his head to keep his long hair  --  gray but still streaked with its original sun-bleached auburn and gathered behind into an eight-inch ponytail  --  out of the clay , wet and spinning on the foot-powered wheel . A fall in his teens from a horse had left him with a limp , and the wheel , which he refused to electrify , limped with him , while out of the spinning his masculine hands shaped blobs upward into graceful vessels with slender waists and swelling bottoms . <br> It was in bed she first felt his death coming . His erections began to wilt just as she might have come if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a palpable loosening in the knit of his sinews . There had been a challenging nicety in the taut way Jim dressed himself  --  pointy vanilla-colored boots , butt-hugging jeans with rivet-bordered pockets , and crisp checked shirts double-buttoned at the cuff . Once a dandy of his type , he began to wear the same shirt two and even three days in a row . His jaw showed shadows of white whisker underneath , from careless shaving or troubled eyesight . When the ominous blood counts began to arrive from the hospital , and the shadows in the X-rays were visible to even her untrained eyes , he greeted the news with stoic lassitude ; Alexandra had to fight to get him out of his crusty work clothes into something decent . They had joined the legion of elderly couples who fill hospital waiting rooms , as quiet with nervousness as parents and children before a recital . She felt the other couples idly pawing at them with their eyes , trying to guess which of the two was the sick one , the doomed one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to present Jim as a mother presents a child going to school for the first time , as a credit to her . They had lived , these thirty-plus years since she had lived in Eastwick , by their own rules , up in Taos ; there the free spirits of the Lawrences and Mabel Dodge Luhan still cast a sheltering cachet over the remnant tribe of artistic wannabes , a hard-drinking , New Age  --  superstitious , artsy-craftsy crowd who aimed their artifacts , in their shop-window displays , more and more plaintively at scrimping , low-brow tourists rather than the well-heeled local collectors of Southwestern art . Alexandra for a time had revived her manufacture of little ceramic " bubbies "  --  faceless , footless little female figures , pleasant to hold in the hand and roughly painted in clothes worn as close to the skin as tattoos  --  but Jim , jealous and dictatorial in his art as true artists are , had been less than gracious about sharing his kiln . In any case , the miniature women , their vulval cleft boldly dented into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to an uncomfortable prior period of her life , when she had practiced , with two other Rhode Island divorcees , a half-baked suburban variety of witchcraft . <br> Jim 's illness drove her and Jim down from safe , arty Taos into the wider society , the valleys of the ailing , a vast herd moving like stampeded bison toward the killing cliff . The socialization forced upon her  --  interviews with doctors , most of them unsettlingly young ; encounters with nurses , demanding merciful attentions the hospitalized patient was too manly and depressed to ask for himself ; commisera- tion with others in her condition , soon-to-be widows and widowers she would have shunned on the street but now , in these antiseptic hallways , embraced with shared tears  --  prepared her for travel in the company of strangers . <br> She could not believe it  --  how totally Jim was gone , his morning absence as vivid as a rooster 's wake-up crow , his evening non-appearance a refusal bound , she felt , to be cancelled , any moment , by the scuffling sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two rooms away , of his potter 's wheel . Three months after his death , she signed up for a ten-day tour of the Canadian Rockies . Her old , married , cosseted self , a bohemian snob proud of her careless , mannish clothes and high-desert privacy , would have sneered at the feigned camaraderie of an organized group tour . She foresaw the daily duty to rise and gorge on cafeteria-style hotel breakfasts and submit to more marvels , and the resisted but irresistible naps in the swaying bus in clammy proximity to an alien body , usually that of another plucky widow , overweight and remorselessly talkative . Then there would be the sleepless hours , amid worrisome small noises and mysterious tiny red lights , in a king-size bed built for a couple . Hotel pillows were always too stuffed , too full , and lifted her head too high , so she woke , groggily dumfounded to have slept at all , with a stiff neck . The pillow next to hers would be undented . It would dawn on her that she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , born in Colorado , she thought it an amusing idea to follow the Rockies north into another country , where a dramatic landscape did not flatter the rapacious vanity of the United States . And Canada , she discovered , did have its good points : airports not bribed to install television sets pouring forth an inescapable babble , and voices whose familiar North American accent was braced by a few leftover Scots vowels , and a gray imperial gravity of public architecture . This national identity had been created by the sensible spirit of business enterprise , linking the provinces like great beads on an iron railroad line , rather than by any evangelical preachment of a Manifest Destiny  --  manifest only to its Anglo perpetrators  --  that had hurled the agglutinated United States westwards and then outwards , across all the oceans , where its boy soldiers lost limbs and died . The daily death-tolls from Iraq were worth escaping . <br> On the other hand , in Canada hotel restaurants still seemed to think Frank Sinatra and Nat " King " Cole the latest thing in background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were headed off to dreary cold Alaska . Canada , its tundra and icefields and miles of forest pressing its population down tight against the forty-ninth parallel , had in self-defense embraced Green-ness , trying to make a pet of it , mining for tourist dollars the nostalgia and righteousness inherent in its cause . Bring Back Nature  --  who could object to that ? But for Alexandra , totem poles and emblematic moose had a basic boringness . She felt , up here , trapped in an attic of stuffed animals . Nature had been her ally in witchcraft , but still she distrusted it , as a conscienceless killer , spendthrift and blind . <br> After a day in Vancouver , and another in determinedly quaint Victoria , the tour  --  forty travellers , none of them young and eight of them Australian  --  boarded a sleeper train and were dragged northwards through the dark . They woke amid mountains dazzling with the yellow of turning aspens . The tour had reserved a viewing car for their party , and Alexandra , hesitantly entering , after a heavy breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted with hesitant smiles from the already seated couples . She took one of the few seats left and was conscious of the vacancy at her side , as if of a monstrous wen throwing her face off balance . <br> But , then , she could never have talked Jim into coming on such an adventure . He hated foreign countries , even the Virgin Islands , where , a few times early in their marriage , she had persuaded him to take her , as a break from the long Taos winter and the ski-season traffic jams along Route 522 . They had arrived in St. Thomas , as it turned out , in the late afternoon , and were caught , in their rented Volkswagen Beetle , in the evening rush hour , Jim trying to drive for the first time in his life on the wrong side of the road . More unfortunately still , they were surrounded by black drivers who took a racist pleasure in tailgating them and in rebuking every sign of automotive uncertainty with prolonged , indignant honking . Though eventually they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , Jim got sunburned the first day , having scorned her repeated offer of sunscreen , and then got deadly sick on some conch salad . Whenever , ever after , he felt bested in an exchange of accusations , he would remind her , in detail , of that week that almost -- twenty-five years before he really died -- killed him . <br> Now , in Canada , there was not a road or car in sight , just the tracks and tunnels ahead as the train bored upward through mountains splashed with quaking golden leaves . " There 's Mount Robson ! " a woman behind Alexandra excitedly told her husband . <br> An Australian across the aisle , in an attempt at friendliness , said to Alexandra , " Mount Robson ahead , " as if she were deaf as well as alone . <br> From behind this speaker , another voice -- not Australian , less peppy , with a tinge of the American Southern tinge -- explained to her , everybody around her suddenly solicitous , as if of a defective in their midst , " The tallest peak in the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandra asked , knowing she sounded stupid and covering herself with " I mean , should n't they have saved it for later in the tour ? " <br> Nobody laughed , perhaps not hearing , or understanding , her little joke . The train was taking a long curve , and the gleaming mountain-tip sank from view behind the aspens ; the peak had been oddly regular , like a pyramid in a set of child 's blocks , but white . " How high is it ? " she asked aloud , determined to combat her sense of non-existence . <br> Again , she had struck a silencing note . " Nearly four thousand meters , " an Australian voice volunteered . <br> She had trouble translating out of the metric system , and , borrowing a bit of her late husband 's xenophobia , refused to try . The slightly Southern voice understood , and explained , " Nearly thirteen thousand feet , ma'am . " <br> " My goodness ! " Alexandra said , beginning to enjoy her own inanity . She turned her head to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lean-faced , with deep creases and a mustache just long enough to droop . His costume , too --  faded tight blue jeans and a long-sleeved red-checked shirt --  reminded her of Jim . " Thank you , " she said , with more warmth than she had strictly intended . Perhaps this man with his air of dignified sorrow was a widower . Or was waiting for some slow-moving wife to join him here in the viewing car . <br> " Mount Robson is n't on the tour , " the wife behind Alexandra was saying in her ear , in a penetrating , slightly vexed voice . " It 's in a separate national park from Jasper . " <br> " I really have n't done my homework , " Alexandra apologized , backwards , experiencing a flash of hatred -- the old impatient , witchy , bug-zapping kind of hate she thought she had long outgrown . Why should this woman , common and shrewish from the sound of her voice , have a live husband , when she , Alexandra , did not , sitting here exposed on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's my style , too , " a male Australian reassured her . <br> " Learn as you go . It 's my wife reads the books ahead . " <br> " And sees to the tickets and passports , you lazy sod , " the wife said , in the humorous tone of a practiced complaint . <br> The train , smoother-running than American trains , on Canadian National Railway tracks welded and upheld by the government , continued to nose skyward . Mount Robson again appeared above the trees , its whiteness marked now by black striations -- by snow-striped patches , faceted as if the peak had been carved to a point like a flint weapon . The hard cobalt of a picture-postcard sky pressed on these concave contours until the peak disappeared again behind the waves of yellow leaves . " It says here , " the Australian wife loudly announced , holding a guidebook , " it was first climbed in 1913 , by an Austrian bloke named Kain . K-A-I-N . It says the Canadian mountain men did n't like it when foreigners were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy noses out of joint . " <br> Alexandra sighed and closed her lids , excusing herself from hearing any more . She wanted to relieve them all of having to pay her any further attention . Being a big woman , tall and somewhat broad , her full head of chestnut-brown hair still only half white , had given her a presence when she was younger but now that she was old and mateless made her conspicuous , an embarrassment to herself . Kain , Cain , she thought . The first man to do a truly wicked deed , worse even than eating the apple of knowledge . Slew his brother , Abel . Thirty years ago Alexandra had slain a sister witch : she and Sukie Rougemont and Jane Smart had killed little Jenny Gabriel , though the death certificate blamed metastasized malignancy of the ovaries . The curse of it was always there , inside Alexandra , even when she did n't close her eyes , a sour gnawing . As negligible as a worm in the earth during the daylight hours , at night in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . Again and again her dreams returned her to that hectic period , when Darryl Van Horne had taken as wife not one of the three of them but a younger woman , fair and ivory-skinned , with innocent , ice-blue eyes -- too damned innocent , the older witches had felt . Had Jenny been less innocent , had she been as corrupt as they were , they would have accepted her besting them as part of a game among equals , marrying a man who after all had n't cared for women , it turned out , and was not even rich , as they had been led to believe . They had imagined him , conjured him out of their own needs . <br> Continues ...
