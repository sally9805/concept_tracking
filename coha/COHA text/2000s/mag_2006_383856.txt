WHAT 'S IT TAKE TO CONQUER NEW HAMPSHIRE 'S MT . WASHINGTON HILLCLIMB-A 7.6-MILE CRAWL IN FOG AND 50-MPH WINDS THAT 'S CONSIDERED THE TOUGHEST UPHILL RACE IN THE WORLD ? WE STOOD AT THE PEAK FOR THE 2005 EVENT AND ASKED SOME FINISHERS . // KIMBERLY WELSH AGE : 42 CLIMB : 1:38:17 ; 4.6 MPH I 'm an investment banker with long hours and lots of travel , but also an awesome husband who makes sure I get plenty of weekend rides-including a 40mile loop with an 18- to 20-percent grade we call Hurl Hill . At the top of Mt . Washington , my friend Tina was blown off her bike twice . I stayed upright by screaming into the face of the wind in sheer defiance , but I was scared , which is a rare-and , in retrospect , very exciting-feeling for me . PETERJANTZEN AGE : 41 CLIMB:1:26:28 ; 5.3MPH My mountain hiking background , which taught me to stay in the seat , really seemed to help-especially when we got above tree line and the famine-relief roadies were falling like flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and 12 gels , and leveraged one of my favorite quotes : " Just ride in your zone and the bike will do the rest . " JEFFREY KOZLOWSKI AGE : 35 CLIMB : 1:17:01 ; 5.9 MPH I 'm an lronman triathlete , and finished Mt . Washington in 1:14 in ' 04-winning the 190-pound-plus Clydesdale division-but I 've never suffered as much in my life as I did this time . I did my usual tri training , and registered in the age-group category instead of Clydesdale , hoping to be under 190 and to hit 1:10.1 weighed 194 , and 10 minutes in was averaging 170 bpm-I average 167 when I 'm running hard , 800-meter repeats . At the summit , my coach 's son said , " Dude , you look stoned . " It was pure suffering , but I 've thought a lot about the fact that if I 'd made my goal , the suffering would have felt sweet instead of painful . PIERREBIANCHETTI AGE:62 CLIMB : 1:29:17 ; 5.1 MPH My only local hill Is a 10- to 16-percent half-mile climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 10 consecutive climbs in one ride , then the week before the race , I did the 10 repeats on three separate days . On race day , when the road opened up into wind and fog , I got knocked off my bike . I was no longer trying to beat the mountain , but rather make friends with it and hope it would let me make it to the top . That mountain got into my head . Maybe one day I 'll try it again . DEBRA BROWN AGE:46 CLIMB : 1:27:51:5.2 MPH The first time I climbed Mt . Washington was in a car , taking notes for a friend who wanted to scout the route so she could strategize for her race . She was telling me when to note " rest " and " push , " and pacings and attacks . By mile 3 , she told me to put my pencil down . The race is about mental stamina . ANDREW TOPLYN AGE:19CLIMB:1:31:42 ; 5MPH When I was diagnosed with a degenerative spinal disorder , I had to quit the rowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing for only a year , so I was surprised with my time . I think the key was watching my heart monitor . As long as I stayed as close to 87 percent as possible-the climb is basically a 7-mile time trial at lactate threshold-I 'd finish in a good time without exploding . I plan to train for a yearfor ' 06 , and hope to break the elite 1:20 mark . ROL HESSELBART AGE : 60 CLIMB : 1:35:16 ; 4.8 MPH I 've raced Mt . Washington since 2000 , training extensively for the first three , starting with 40- to 90-minute structured workouts 1 or 5 days a week in winter , then 200-300 miles per week in season , with repeats on 10- to 12-percent hills for 1-3 miles . One year I did 1:31 just two months alter getting a cast off a broken tibia/fibula . Then in ' 03,1 rode from Newport Beach , CA , to Revere Beach , MA , in 31 days , averaging 112 miles per day , and that seemed to dull my compulsive , competitive riding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still seem to ride more days than not . CHARLOTTE AND BILLGLENNIE AGES 18/51 CLIMB : 2:35:39 ; 2.9 MPH I bought a tandem two months before the race for a fun father-daughter experience . Our training was , to say the least , modest . I 've ridden regularly for years , and Charlotte has rowed crew for about five years , but we could get together only once before the climb-for a total pre-race mileage of about 50 . We really depended on accumulated fitness to get us to the top . PATRICK FORD AGE:39 CLIMB : 1:31:33 ; 5 MPH Living in the Massachusetts flats , I rode crits one day a week to get my legs and lungs used to sustained max efforts . Still , Mt . Washington averages 12 percent , with long ramps of 15-18 percent and a 50-yard section of 22 percent up top . You need hard hill workouts . But no training prepares you for the weather or wind . I weigh 185 pounds , and was actually blown off my bike at mile 6 . ERIC BRANDHORST AGE:43 CLIMB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is climbing-it 's hard to simulate a 12-percent grade on a trainer or by going hard on the flats . I do 100-150 miles per week but , more important , try to climb 5,000 vertical feet a week in the three months before the race . Even though I weigh 195,1 enjoy settling into a nice rhythm , enjoying the scenery as it changes with elevation , and trying to take the polka-dot jersey within my group of friends . KERRY LITKA AGE:28CLIMB:1:16:51 ; 5.9MPH I 'm freakishly small-4-foot-11 and 93 pounds-so I was that kid who got picked last in gym class . But when I started racing in 1999,1 discovered that I have a bit of talent for climbing , and now I 'm a Cat 2.1 train all year , but focus on Mt . Washington , which is in August , starting in early July . I did 51 hours of training in the month before the race . I do n't do climbing repeats . I pick a three-hour hilly route and do each rise in a sustained , high-intensity effort . I also do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , long intervals give me good LT and V0sub 2-max work , which really helps climbing . DOMINIQUE CODERE AGE:46 CLIMB : 1:24:35 ; 5.4MPH Thanks to Canadian weather and my job , I usually have only about 2,500 miles before the race . The first year I did it I wore a heart monitor but it annoyed me . Now I go more on feeling , and I 've made my age-group podium five out of six races . JOE SEMPLE AGE:43 CLIMB . 1:26:30 ; 5.3 MPH I 'm married with an 11-year-old daughter , a full-time job and mostly non-cycling friends , so I fit training in when and where I can . I commute to work once a week , sneak in a one-hour lunch ride once a week , and try to squeeze in a 30-40 miler on weekends . I averaged 100-120 miles per week , with a max week of 175 . ( My wife must have been out of town . ) For me , a lot of the race is mental fortitude . Walking is not an option , and quitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1:11:36 ; 6.4 MPH In New England I trained on Greylock , Okemo and Ascutney , then went to France and rode Alpe d'Huez , Ventoux , Galibier , Tourmalet , Madeleine , Courchevel , PIa d'Atet , Hautacam , etc . I didn'ttaper much because I do n't ride lots of miles . Instead of big miles , I do 1-1.5 hours of hills per day , using a heart monitor to stay out of the red zone . NED OVEREND AGE:50 CLIMB : 0:55:20 ; 8.2 MPH I 've wanted to do the race for years but always had scheduling conflicts with other races . It was hard to simulate the course in Ourango , CO , where we have plenty of long climbs but none that steep . After I asked my training partner and Mt . Washington record holder , Tom Danielson , for advice , I did efforts based on an estimated time of one hour . I used one , 26-tooth chainring and a 12-25 cog : high enough for the start yet low enough to not bog my cadence on steeps . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode my Specialized Roubaix because it 's light and the more-upright position is better for breathing on climbs . By the way : I can stay with Tom for two hours of his five-hour rides . AIMEE VASSE AGE:27 CLIMB : 1:12:38 ; 6.3 MPH No matter how much climbing preparation I do , the gale-force winds at the top never fail to challenge my stamina . I 've discovered the perfect training location : Fort Collins , CO , near the Boulder base of my team , and home to many long and steep climbs , regularly sports gusts over 50 mph . I hope to win Mt . Washington again in ' 06 , but not get blown off my bike . <p>
