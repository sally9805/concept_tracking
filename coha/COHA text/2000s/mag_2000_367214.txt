Anne Guepiere works in the Hong Kong office of a large U.S. company that would prefer to remain nameless . At about 4 o'clock last Thursday , she received an e-mail . It seemed innocuous enough . The subject line read ILOVEYOU . With it came an attached document labeled **27;11218;TOOLONG . How nice . Just a couple of clicks , and her curiosity would be satisfied . <P> Too late . " I did n't even read the ' ILOVEYOU ' part , " recalls Guepiere , whom history would record as , if not Patient Zero , then surely one of the earliest victims in a global pandemic . " Only when I opened the attachment did I realize there was a problem . " Indeed , it was a bigger problem than anybody , probably even its mischievous creator , could have imagined as computers everywhere tumbled like so many dominoes . Once again that scourge of the Internet age  --  a computer virus  --  had struck . Silently , lethally , without even a hint of a warning fever , it raced around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce and politics to a halt . <P> Because of its implicit , fatally attractive message  --  Oh , just give me a glance , I bear friendly tidings from a loving admirer !  --  headline writers immediately ( and irresistibly ) nicknamed it the Love Bug . But there was nothing lovable about it . Before it spent itself  --  in its first incarnation , it was truly a 24-hour virus  --  it would affect tens of millions of computers , eventually ring up a toll as high as $10 billion in lost work hours and reopen troubling questions about the safety and security of our vital electronic lifelines . By almost any measure , it was the most damaging virus ever , with at least three times the byte  --  as more than one punster put it  --  of Melissa , last year 's electronic femme fatale . This was not so much because of its ingenuity , says Finnish computer-virus hunter Mikko Hypponen , whose team was among the first to capture the bug 's digital DNA , but because of its blinding speed , spreading around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melissa ) . <P> Suspicion fell quickly on a possible culprit in the Philippines , in part because the virus ' eight pages of computer code contained a tantalizing word : Barok . A search of virus registries quickly revealed that it was the name of a so-called Trojan horse , a stealthy software program that filches passwords , written by a Filipino hacker last year . Still , the transparency of this clue suggested that the word might have been inserted as a deliberate smoke screen to fool the computer sleuths . By week 's end , the work of investigators was further complicated by the appearance of a number of copycat viruses , created either by others or by the Love Bug 's author . <P> Like a real Asian influenza , the virus first emerged in Hong Kong . From there it sped westward with the sun , lying silently in wait in corporate e-mail accounts until unsuspecting office denizens punched in , logged on and double-clicked on the file . Shufiyan Shukur , managing editor of an online news service in Malaysia , was infected when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew this guy liked practical jokes but clicked it open anyway . Too late . Twenty minutes later , he laments , " our internal-security people sent out a warning about this virus . "
