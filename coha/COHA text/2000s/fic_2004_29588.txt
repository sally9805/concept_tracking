Chapter One The first letter bomb exploded in the mailroom of the Hartford Courier at 8:06 A.M. The second bomb blew up at the Buffalo Daily Express at 8:18 A.M. By the time the third one went off ten minutes later at the Allentown Scribe , CNN was reporting a terrifying trend . In Chicago , in her bedroom , a barely awake Shelby Simon grabbed the remote and turned up the volume of her TV several notches . " ... no reports of injuries as yet , Diane , but authorities here in Hartford are confirming that at least one person was taken to a local hospital . At this point , what we do know is that all three newspapers are part of the Helm-Harris Syndicate , whose flagship paper is the Chicago Daily Mirror . " " Uh-oh . " At the mention of her employer , Shelby clicked the volume up again and continued to stare at the screen . The camera came back to the anchor desk , where the perfectly coiffed and glossy-mouthed Diane Delgado said , " We 're receiving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , frowning as she concentrated on a piece of paper just handed to her from offscreen . " Apparently there 's been a fourth letter bomb incident in the offices of the Columbus Citizen , another paper in the Helm-Harris Syndicate , if I 'm not mistaken . " The attractive blonde blinked into the camera and managed a thin imitation of a smile . " We 'll be back with more details right after this break . " Shelby turned the volume down , reached for the phone beside her bed , and punched in the number of the Chicago Daily Mirror . What was she doing , anyway , watching breaking news on television , when she could get it faster and firsthand from the wires at her very own office ? " Come on . Somebody answer , " she muttered after the fourth ring , just before the automatic system kicked in . " You have reached the offices of the Chicago Daily Mirror . We are unable to take your call right now ... " While she listened to the smooth and efficient voice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV screen . It was after eight . The auto answer at the paper should 've been deactivated by now . They only used the system after regular business hours . By this time of the morning , at least half the staff would already be at work . She 'd be there herself right now if the battery in her alarm clock had n't croaked sometime during the previous night . " Please leave a message after the tone . " " Shit . " It was the only message Shelby could think of just then . She showered and dressed in record time , choosing slacks over one of her usual tailored suits , donning sneakers rather than heels in order to get downtown fast . In the background , CNN was reporting on a fifth incident-or was it a sixth ? - and lining up their terrorism experts just in case . " Have there been any threats against the Helm-Harris papers ? " the blond anchor asked her correspondent in the field . " Not that I 'm aware of , Diane . If you 'll recall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that concluded in successful negotiations . Their contract wo n't be up for another three years . We 're waiting right now for a briefing from postal inspectors here in Hartford . " " Thank you , Eric . We 'll keep an eye on the monitor and get back to you as soon as that briefing begins . Now let 's go to Susan Carey in Buffalo . Susan ? " Shelby clicked off the TV , grabbed her handbag , and hustled toward the front door of her apartment . The instant she closed the door behind her , though , she knew she 'd made a terrible mistake because her neighbor 's door immediately opened and Mo Pachinski , part-time mobster and full-time sexist pig , stepped into the hallway , blocking Shelby 's passage . What did the guy do ? Wait with his hand on the knob and his eye on the peephole every morning ? He 'd been driving her nuts for months , ever since he moved in , accosting her in the hall this way , until she 'd learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apartment 12C . But this morning she 'd been off her game , befuddled by oversleeping and then distracted by the news . " Hiya , Doll . " Mo was wearing a gorilla-sized electric blue warm-up suit , its velour jacket unzipped a few calculated inches in order to display the gold chains nestled in the dark forest of his chest hair . As always , Old Spice radiated from his muscle-bound body like a toxic cloud , fairly knocking Shelby off her feet . " Runnin ' a little late this morning , huh , Doll ? " " As a matter of fact , I am . " She tried to sound rushed rather than impatient , polite rather than pissed , not wanting to offend him because she suspected , if he was n't exactly in the Mob , he was at least connected to it . She 'd asked him once what he did for a living , and his answer was a rather vague and smirky I consult . Mobbed up or not , Mo had problems with the women in his life . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the man had a lot of problems . And because Shelby was an advice columnist , Mo was constantly asking her for just that-advice . Should he send roses ? Was four dozen too much ? Or not enough ? Red ones or pink ? What about diamonds ? What about your lesser jewels ? What did Shelby think ? In the beginning , Shelby considered him a challenge . Now he was just a pest , especially this morning when the newspapers in which her column appeared seemed to be exploding all across the country . " Could we talk later , Mo ? " " Yeah . Yeah , sure . Okay . " He shrugged and stepped aside just enough to let her pass through his aura of aftershave . " Later 's okay , " he grumbled . " When exactly ? " " Oh ... " Shelby called over her shoulder as she sprinted for the elevator . " Just later . " " Like tonight ? " " Well ... " She smiled sweetly , hit the DOWN button , and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid closed . Shelby jumped on the bus headed south on State Street , and was n't at all surprised when the driver , a man she 'd never seen before in her life , greeted her . " Hey , Ms. Simon . How 's it goin ' ? " After all , how surprising was it that he recognized her when her face was plastered on both sides of his vehicle on five-foot-long banners that proclaimed " Ms. Simon Says ... Read the Daily Mirror ! " Her picture had been running alongside her column for years , so she was n't exactly unknown , but this latest ad campaign had suddenly vaulted Ms. Shelby Simon from minor , ho-hum celebrity to a kind of local stardom . People used to stop her in the street with " Oh , you look so familiar . " Now it was " Hey , Ms. Simon . How 's it goin ' ? " and " Yo , Shelby . " She still was n't sure exactly how she felt about the notoriety . What had been a real kick at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoy . She had n't become an advice columnist in order to be famous . In fact , she had n't wanted to be one at all . It had never occurred to her . Well , whoever grew up wanting to be an advice columnist , for heaven 's sake ? Kids dreamed of being astronauts , great athletes , rock stars , and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalists . Which was what Shelby had every intention of being after she graduated from the journalism school at Northwestern . Unfortunately , the day she interviewed at the Daily Mirror just happened to be the same day that the venerable and much beloved and hugely syndicated Dear Gabby passed away . Hal Stabler was the managing editor at the time , and he 'd already asked better than half his staff who 'd like to take over the paper 's advice column , and had been met with everything from grim silence to polite demurrals to outright guffaws . The poor man had been desperate . " Want to give it a whirl ? " he 'd asked his interviewee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest , as they say , was history . And now , twelve years later , that history included a certain high visibility she was n't entirely comfortable with . Still , she had a lot more to worry about this morning than her dubious fame . What in the world was going on with these letter bombs at the Helm-Harris papers ? Was it the unions or some disgruntled ex-employee ? Or could it really be some sort of terrorist attack as they had speculated on TV ? How many people had been injured ? Oh , God . She jumped off the bus at Wacker Drive , then trotted the two blocks to the Daily Mirror , her anxiety increasing with every step , not to mention her blood pressure , as she saw the fire trucks and ambulances and squad cars in front of the building , and-God Almighty ! -a big black box of a truck prominently labeled " Bomb Squad Disposal Unit . " A little moan of relief broke from her lips when she spotted Derek McKay sitting on one of the huge cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since it was October , the pots were brimming with chrysanthemums in shades of yellow and bronze , and the darker hues were a perfect complement to Derek 's bushy auburn mustache and chronically tousled hair . " Welcome to pandemonium , " he said as she approached . " You 're late this morning . " " I overslept . " Shelby perched beside him . " What 's going on ? " If anybody knew , it would be Derek , ace investigative reporter , winner of numerous awards , not the least of which was a Pulitzer . He and Shelby had had a pretty torrid affair right after she started working at the paper . It was , she later learned , sort of an initiation rite . Derek had affairs with all the bright young things who crossed the Daily Mirror 's threshold . Amazingly , they all forgave him . At least Shelby had . Before he could answer her , she pointed to the tall paper cup in his hand . " I 'd kill for a sip of coffee , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm cup and Shelby took a gulp of the frothy brew , then promptly choked . " Jesus , Derek , " she sputtered . " What 's in that ? " He grinned and pulled a tiny silver flask from the pocket of his corduroy jacket . " Greetings from Jamaica , mon . " " Rum ? At this hour of the morning ? " " Hell , Shelby . It 's almost nine . " She shook her head , handing the cup back to him . " Thanks anyway . So tell me what 's going on . Another letter bomb ? " " Probably . They 're searching the building now . " " This is horrible . " A little shiver coursed down her spine . " Any idea who might be behind it ? " Derek shook his head . " Nope . But they 've got a pretty good idea who the target is . " " Oh , yeah ? Who ? " He looked at her then with such warmth that for a split second Shelby felt a twinge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had happened scores of lovers ago . His . Not hers . " So who 's the target ? " she asked again . " You , " he said . " Every letter bomb was addressed to you . " Half an hour later-after the bomb sniffing dogs had successfully located the lethal letter and the bomb techs had sealed it in a metal canister and driven it away-and after the police and the postal inspectors had asked her a few preliminary questions-Shelby answered the summons to her boss 's office , which was a glass-walled cubicle in the center of the Metro floor , usually referred to as the Sweat Box . Her entire staff was already assembled there . And her entire staff-all three of them-were looking distinctly distraught . Sandy Hovis , her loyal secretary and personal spell checker since day one of the column , was there . The only word that Sandy could n't spell was diarrhea , which did n't matter all that much since Ms. Simon rarely said it . Sandy was sitting on the edge of a chair directly across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying and was clutching a wad of Kleenex as big as a softball and getting tissue lint all over her black wool skirt . Poor thing . Still single as she approached the big Five O , Sandy was the sole support of an older brother with cerebral palsy . From the beginning , Shelby had made sure , with each new contract she 'd signed , that her secretary received a handsome raise in the bargain . In spite of her robust coloring , her plus size figure , and her ability to spell every word in the English language but one , Sandy had always been a bit fragile emotionally , always teetering on the brink of tears , but the past few years , as things had grown more and more unsettled in the world , the woman had become a certifiable nervous wreck . Shelby had been hounding her lately about signing up for a yoga class that apparently worked miracles with its students . Now did n't seem like a good time to hound her further , so she merely placed a reassuring hand on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy said with a wet sniff and a linty flourish of her tissues . " Just awful . I 'm so upset . " " It 'll be okay , " Shelby murmured . Well , it would , would n't it ? She gazed across the office , offering what she hoped was a buoyant smile to the other members of her staff . Jeff Kerr , a thirty-something neo-beatnik and researcher par excellence , sat glumly on a leather couch , chewing on a cuticle , while next to him , Kellie Carter , the pretty young intern from Northwestern , sat staring straight ahead as she twisted the hell out of a long red skein of hair . The two of them reminded Shelby of Gilligan and Ginger under extreme duress . She was just about to offer a word of encouragement to the troops when Hal Stabler blasted through the door and announced , " We 're shutting down your column , Shelby . As of right now . " " You ca n't do that , " she gasped . Could he ? " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backside into the leather swivel chair behind his desk . " But ... " He held up a hand in warning . " This is not negotiable , Shelby . I mean it . I 've just been upstairs with Brian and Bob . This is their decision . " Brian and Bob , though the names may have sounded like a folksinging duo from the sixties , were actually Brian Helm and Bob Harris . The Helm and The Harris of the Syndicate . The Wunderkind of Newspaper Publishing . The Powers that be . Alpha and Omega . And in this case , apparently , the final word . Canceled . Oh , God . Suddenly her knees felt a little wobbly so she sagged into the chair next to Sandy 's . " This is horrible . " " You got that right , " Hal said . He was a man who always looked harried and hassled , as if he bore the burdens of the entire planet on his beefy shoulders , but right now he looked particularly oppressed . Leaning back in his chair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Frankly , it sucks . Still , it could suck worse . Brian and Bob think it will be worse if we keep running your column . So it 's canceled . Temporarily , at least . Now , here 's the deal ... " He went on to describe what amounted to a fairly generous offer of continued employment for her staff . " They can use you down in the Lifestyle department , Sandy . Talk to Jean Prewett . She 'll get you settled in . " " Thank you , Mr. Stabler . " Sandy 's tears of anxiety turned to those of gratitude . " God bless you . " " Yeah . Yeah . You can stop crying now , all right ? Jesus . " Hal glowered and swiveled his chair toward the couch . Continues ...
