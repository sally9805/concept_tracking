<p> If you think your brain loses its firepower as you age , think again . <p> New imaging research shows that your brain may actually work better as you get older . <p> There is a caveat , though . You have to use your brain to keep growing brain cells , said Dr. Gene Cohen , director of the Center on Aging , Health and Humanities at George Washington University . <p> Cohen , author of " The Mature Mind : The Positive Power of the Aging Brain " ( Basic Books , $15.95 ) will be in Atlanta March 22 to share some of his and others ' recent research into how the aging brain works . He will speak at 2 p.m. at the Atlanta History Center 's Woodruff Auditorium . Free . For reservations , call 404-467-4900 . <p> For years , scientists believed that humans developed all the brain cells they would ever have by the time they were 3 or 4 years old , with the overwhelming majority of cells being produced by the time of birth . <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not only do people grow new brain cells as they age but also that the older brain often actually functions better than a younger one . <p> " It 's as if we move to all-wheel drive , " Cohen said . Both sides of the brain begin to work together in middle age , and that work can be enhanced as the brain grows older , especially if it grows new brain cells . <p> The thinking part of the brain has about 100 billion neurons , Cohen said . Each neuron , in turn , can produce hundreds or thousands of dendrites , or extensions that conduct impulses to other cells . <p> That means the brain has the capacity for more than 1 trillion cell-to-cell connections , according to Cohen . <p> And that capacity increases the more we use our brains , Cohen said . <p> " Research tells us it 's never too late , " Cohen said . <p> Diane Kee , 63 , of Atlanta is n't buying it  --  although she does want to see Cohen 's book to learn if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I ca n't imagine what he 's talking about , " said Kee , laughing . " Sometimes I 'm driving and I turn the corner , and I ca n't remember where I am . " <p> Like many people in their 50s and older , Kee , a retired lawyer , has " senior moments " when she will walk into a room and forget why she entered it . <p> So a few years ago she started working crossword puzzles to help her memory , she said . <p> Did it help ? <p> " No , but I did get better at crossword puzzles , " Kee said . <p> Dr. Jon Kaas , a professor of psychology and cellular biology at Vanderbilt University , explained that aging brains are better at tasks they " rehearse " repetitively , such as doing crossword puzzles . While such activity will help practitioners recall words and language faster , it may not translate to other activities . <p> " Doing crosswords wo n't be good for tennis , " Kaas said . <p> Thus , people may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That repetitive activity changes the microcircuitry within the brain , Kaas said . <p> Studies in rehabilitation and physical therapy , such as that for stroke patients , actually began to yield some of the new science on the brain , Kaas said . <p> As patients suffered a loss of mobility in one limb , for example , they were taught by therapists to rely only on the well-functioning limb . <p> And that suggested to researchers that the aging brain can do things once thought beyond its reach . <p> But just as in physical therapy , the aging brain must work out , Kaas said . <p> " The real problem is that as people get older , they do less and less , " he said . " So they lose circuitry . " <p> Cohen said a key to flexing our mental muscle is to do something mental that truly challenges us . Think of it as weightlifting for the brain , Cohen said , where resistance training , such as weightlifting , actually thickens muscle fiber . <p> While brains do not thicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neurons and dendrites . <p> That said , there are changes in the brain as people age , Cohen said . And some brain illnesses and disorders , such as Alzheimer 's disease , only occur in older age . <p> But if a brain is healthy , it is able to work well into the upper decades , Cohen said , so long as it has regular challenges . <p> Cohen 's and others ' findings could have significance well beyond quality-of-life issues , he said . As baby boomers age , employers would do well to value their aging workers for their contributions  --  and for the things they do not do , such as steal at the office . Cohen said studies show that older workers are less likely to steal from their companies and also less likely to play hooky or take a sick day when they are not truly ill . <p> In addition , older workers often bring pragmatism , judgment and a creativity borne of a sense of " why not ? " <p> Cohen tells a story about his parents-in-law , Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowstorm while visiting Cohen and his wife in Washington , D.C. The couple could n't get a taxi , so they took the subway . <p> When they emerged from the stairs of their stop , however , they still had a walk that would have been too far in a snowstorm , and Cohen and his wife were in traffic and could n't be reached . <p> " So his dendrites were firing , and he saw the steamy windows of a pizza parlor , " Cohen said . The couple went into the restaurant and ordered a pizza to be delivered to Cohen 's home . <p> And then Cohen 's father-in-law asked for something else , something that Cohen believes he would n't have thought of in his younger years <p> " He said , ' Oh yeah , and one more thing , ' " Cohen said . " ' I 'd like you to deliver us with it . ' "
