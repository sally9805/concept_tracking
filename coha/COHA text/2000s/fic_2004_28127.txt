Not the End of the World By Kate Atkinson Little , Brown Kate Atkinson Charlene and Trudi Go Shopping I WANT , " CHARLENE SAID to Trudi , " to buy my mother a birthday present . " " OK , " Trudi said . " Something I can put in the post . Something that wo n't break . " Trudi thought about some of the things you could put in the post that might break . A crystal decanter . A fingernail . An egg . A heart . A Crown Derby teapot . A promise . A mirrored-glass globe in which nothing but the sky is reflected . " How about a scarf ? " she suggested . " In velvet devore . I love that word . Devore . " Charlene and Trudi were in a food hall as vast as a small city . It smelled of chocolate and ripe cheese and raw meaty bacon but most of the food was too expensive to buy and some of it did n't look real . They wandered along an avenue of honey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You could , " Charlene agreed . There was plenty of honey to choose from . There was lavender honey and rosemary honey , acacia and orange blossom and mysterious manuka . Butter-yellow honey from Tuscan sunflowers and thick , anemic honey from English clover . There were huge jars like ancient amphorae and neat spinster-size pots . There were jars of cut-combhoney that looked like seeded amber . There was organic honey from lush South American rain forests and there was honey squeezed from parsimonious Scottish heather on windswept moorlands . Bees the world over had been bamboozled out of their bounty so that Trudi could have a choice , but she had already lost interest . " You could buy her soap , " Trudi said . " Soap would n't break . Expensive soap . Made from oatmeal and buttermilk or goat 's milk and vanilla pods from ... wherever vanilla pods come from . " " Mauritius . Mainly , " Charlene said . " If you say so . Soap for which ten thousand violet petals have been crushed and distilled to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zest of a hundred bittersweet oranges . " " I 'm hungry . I could buy an orange , " Charlene said . " You could . Seville or Moroccan ? " " Moorish , " Charlene said dreamily . " I would like to visit a Moorish palace . The Alhambra . That 's an exotic word . That 's the most exotic word I can think of , offhand . Alhambra . " " Xanadu , " Trudi said . " That 's exotic . A pleasure dome . Imagine having your own pleasure dome . You could call it Pleasureland . Is n't there a Pleasureland in Scarborough ? " " Arbroath , " Charlene said gloomily . " With shady walks through cool gardens , " Trudi said , " where the air is perfumed with attar of roses . " " And fountains and courtyards , " Charlene said . " Fountains that run with nectar . And courtyards full of peacocks and nightingales and larks . And swans . And gold and silver fish swimming in the fountains . And huge blue and white marbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teas . They were lost . " Who would think there were so many different teas in the world ? " Trudi mused . " Chrysanthemum tea , White Peony , Jade Peak , Oriental Beauty Oolong , Green Gunpowder , Golden Needle , Hubei Silver Tip , Drum Mountain White Cloud , Dragon 's Breath tea-do you think it tastes of dragon 's breath ? What do you think dragon 's breath tastes like ? " " Foul , I expect , " Charlene said . " And all day long , " she continued , " in the pleasure dome - " " Pleasureland , " Trudi corrected . " Pleasureland . We would eat melon and figs and scented white peaches and Turkish Delight and candied rose petals . " " And drink raspberry sherbet and tequila and Canadian ice wine , " Trudi enthused . " I should go , " Charlene said . She had failed to recover her spirits since the mention of Arbroath . " I 've got an article to write . " Charlene was a journalist with a bridal magazine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do . " ' " " Saying ' I do n't ' ? " Trudi suggested . " Abracadabra , " Charlene murmured to herself as she crossed against the traffic in the rain , " that 's an exotic word . " Somewhere in the distance a bomb exploded softly . IT HAD BEEN raining for weeks . There were no taxis outside the radio station . Charlene was worried that she was developing a crush on the man who searched her handbag in the reception at the radio station . " I know he 's quite short , " she said to Trudi , " but he 's sort of manly . " " I once went out with a short man , " Trudi said . " I never realized just how short he was until after I 'd left him . " There were no taxis at the rank . There were no taxis dropping anyone off at the radio station . Trudi frowned . " When did you last see a taxi ? " Charlene and Trudi ran from the radio station , ran from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm , dispassionate space of the nearest hotel and sat in the smoky lounge and ordered tea . " I think he 's ex-military or something . " " Who ? " " The man who searches the bags at the radio station . " A waitress brought them weak green tea . They sipped their tea daintily-an adverb dictated by the awkward handles of the cups . " I 've always wanted to go out with a man in a uniform , " Trudi said . " A fireman , " Charlene suggested . " Mm , " Trudi said thoughtfully . " Or a policeman , " Charlene said . " But not a constable . " " No , not a constable , " Charlene agreed . " An inspector . " " An army captain , " Trudi said , " or maybe a naval helicopter pilot . " The weak green tea was bitter . " This could be Dragon 's Breath tea , for all we know , " Trudi said . " Do you think it is ? Dragon 's breath ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , middle-aged women were eating scones with quiet determination . A well-known journalist was seducing a girl who was too young . Two very old men were speaking in low pleasant tones to each other about music and ancient wars . " Thermopylae , " the men murmured . " Aegospotami , Cumae . The ' Dissonant ' Quartet . " " I really want a cat , " Trudi said . " You ca n't keep a cat in town , " Charlene said . " You ca n't keep a cat down ? " " You ca n't keep a cat in town . " " You can . " " You need something small like a rodent , " Charlene said . " A capybara 's a rodent , it 's not small . " " A hamster , " Charlene said , " a gerbil , a small white mouse . " " I do n't want a rodent . Of any size . I want a cat . Kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . If you say something five times you always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charlene said . " True , " Trudi admitted . " I 'd like something more unusual , " Charlene said . " A kangaroo . A reindeer or an otter . A talking bird or a singing fish . " " A singing fish ? " " A singing fish . A fish that sings and has a magic ring in its stomach . A huge carp that is caught in a fishpond-usually at a royal court somewhere-and cooked and served at the table and when you bite into the fish you find a magic ring . And the magic ring will lead you to the man who will love you . Or the small white mouse which is the disguise of the man who will love you . " " That would be a rodent then . " " Failing that , " Charlene continued , ignoring Trudi , " I would like a cat as big as a man . " " A cat as big as a man ? " Trudi frowned , trying to picture a man-size cat . " Yes . Imagine if men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " The waitress asked them if they wanted more of the weak green tea . " For myself , " the waitress said , uninvited , " I prefer dogs . " Charlene and Trudi swooned with delight at the idea of dogs . " Oh God , " Trudi said , overcome by all the breeds of dog in the world , " a German shepherd , a golden retriever , a Great Dane , a borzoi-what a great word-a Saint Bernard , a Scottie , a Westie , a Yorkie . An Austrian pinscher , a Belgian griffon , a Kromfohrlander . The Glen of Imaal terrier , the Manchester , Norwich , English toy , Staffordshire , Bedlington-all terriers also . The Kai , the Podengo Portugueso Medio , the Porcelaine and the Spanish greyhound . The bloodhound , the lurcher , the Dunker , the Catahoula Leopard Dog , the Hungarian vizsla , the Lancashire heeler and the giant German spitz ! " " Or a mongrel called Buster or Spike , " Charlene said . The waitress cleared away their tea things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she whispered to herself as she bumped open the door to the kitchen with her hip . The electricity failed and everyone was suddenly very quiet . No one had realized how dark the rain had made the afternoon . IN THE RECEPTION at the television station there was a tank of fish so big that it covered a whole wall . Trudi noted that they were mostly African freshwater fish . She wondered if they had flown here in a plane and if that had felt strange for them . No one else was taking any notice of the wall of fish . The receptionist had strawberry-blond hair , coiffed extravagantly . She appeared to have a Heckler and Koch MP5A3 9mm submachine gun under her desk . Trudi felt a wave of jealousy . Trudi was a publicist for a small imprint in a large publishing house . She had a twin sister called Heidi and neither Trudi nor Heidi liked her name . They were the names ( in the opinion of Heidi and Trudi ) of goatherding girls and American hookers , of girls who wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed as French maids and nurses . Of girls who never grew up . Trudi and Heidi had no idea why they were so called . Their parents had died in a bizarre accident not long after they were born and the kind strangers who stood in for them , Mr. and Mrs. Marshall , had no insight into their dead parents ' thoughts . CHARLENE AND TRUDI ordered gin slings and picked at a small dish of black olives that tasted more bitter than weak green tea . There were boisterous men in suits perched at the bar . They were wondering how drunk they could get in the precurfew swill . " I need a new haircut , " Charlene said . " I need new hair , " Trudi said . " And thinner ankles , " Charlene said . " And bigger breasts , " Trudi said . " Or maybe I want smaller breasts . " " Your breasts are perfect . " " Thank you . " They could smell the perfume of the women sitting at the adjacent table , peppery and spicy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in very fashionable , very ugly clothes . People stared at them because their clothes were so fashionable and so ugly . They smoked incessantly and drank martinis . There was an oily film on top of their drinks . They looked like high-class whores but they were rock stars ' ex-wives . A waiter dropped a tray of glasses . The boisterous men in suits dangled their cigarettes from their mouths while they applauded . " And , " Trudi said , " I would like to ride on a horse-drawn sleigh through forests in the snow with dogs-borzois-running alongside and I want to be wearing silks and velvets and a cloak lined with the fur of Arctic foxes and bears and wolfkins - " " You mean wolf skins ? " " No , wolfkins-they 're very rare-but only ones that have died of natural causes , not ones that have been killed for their fur . " " Of course not . " " And diamonds , old rose-cut diamonds like dark , melting ice , at my throat and ears , and on my fingers , rubies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet red leather seven-league boots - " " Flat or with a heel ? " " A modest heel . And I want to drink a liqueur made from ripe purple plums from a silver hip flask and - " One of the boisterous men in suits fell off his bar stool . The barman pronounced his time of death as 9:42 P.M. " Time to go home , ladies and gentlemen , " he said , " time to go home . " Later , Charlene wished she had asked Trudi what a wolfkin was . CHARLENE WORRIED THAT she would never have a baby . A baby would love her . A baby would exactly fit the round hollow space inside her . That might be a problem when it grew , of course . " Baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , " she said to the mirror before she went to bed . First , of course , she had to get someone to father the baby and after the humiliating ordeal with the dead solicitor last year she could n't imagine ever having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have imagined . Before . And Charlene would call the baby Smiler . A boy . As fat as a porker , as big as a bomb . In the hours between curfew and dawn Charlene listened to the sirens wailing through the night and planned an article on " Great Tips for Spring Weddings . " She fell asleep with her hand on the Sig Sauer semiautomatic she kept under her pillow and did n't wake until Eosphorus , the morning star , rose and heralded the coming of his mother , Eos , the dawn . TRUDI WAS LOOKING for black trousers . Something simple by Joseph or perhaps Nicole Farhi . Charlene took trousers from the racks in the department store and displayed them with a sales assistant 's flourish for Trudi to view . All the genuine sales assistants seemed to have disappeared . Trudi did n't like any of the trousers Charlene showed her . " Perhaps you could take the trousers from an Armani suit and leave the jacket ? " Charlene suggested . " Or MaxMara-they have a lot of black suits this season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this , do n't you ? Perhaps I could do this for a living . " All the black clothes were sprinkled with plaster dust like dandruff . " From the earthquake , probably , " Charlene said . " They really should be on sale , not full price . " Trudi tried on a Moschino dress and a Prada jacket and a Kenzo cardigan and a Gucci skirt but all the clothes were made for tiny , whippet-thin Japanese girls . " I 'll never go to the ball , " Trudi said sadly . " The balls were all canceled long ago , as you well know , " Charlene said briskly . " Try this Betty Jackson wrap . " In the end , Trudi decided to buy a rhinestone belt but there were no sales assistants to buy it from and unlike nearly everyone else in the city she was n't a thief . " We should make clothes , " Charlene said as they passed through the haberdashery floor of the department store . " What a wonderful word , " Trudi said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . Word . Haberdashery . " " We could buy a sewing machine and share it , " Charlene said . " We could buy cloth and spools of thread and paper patterns and spend pleasant winter evenings dressmaking together . Perhaps by the soft light from beautiful glass oil lamps . We could sit in a pool of golden light from the beautiful glass oil lamps and our silver needles would glimmer and flash as we bowed our heads to the simple yet honest work . " But Trudi was looking at the bolts of cloth , shelf after shelf of every different kind of fabric . " Goodness , " she said , " this is very impressive . Broadcloth and butter muslin , brocade , brocatelle , buckram , bunting , and Botany wool . Bombazine and boucle , burlap and Bedford cord , barege , bobbinet , balbriggan , and barathea ! And that 's just the Bs . Then , there 's cambric and calico and cavalry twill - " The tannoy started up with a sudden howl of feedback and a disembodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would Mr. Scarlet please come to Haberdashery , Mr. Scarlet to Haberdashery , please . " Charlene started to panic . " You know what that means , do n't you ? " she said to Trudi . " No . What does it mean ? " " It 's the code for a fire . It means there 's a fire in Haberdashery . " " I do n't see any fire , " Trudi said . Continues ... by Kate Atkinson
