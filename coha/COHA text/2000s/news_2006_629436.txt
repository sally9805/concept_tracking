<p> THE first West Pointer to be executed for treason : Capt . James Yee would have gone down as one of the blackest villains in American history . <p> In fall 2003 , 10 months into his service as Muslim chaplain at Guantnamo Bay , Yee was arrested , suspected of misdeeds ranging from aiding the enemy to espionage . Clapped into a Navy brig , he spent two and a half months in solitary confinement . <p> But as investigators plunged more deeply into their investigation , the case against Yee evaporated . Later , two additional charges , of adultery and downloading Internet pornography , were added . But when the legal dust settled , the Army simply dropped the more serious allegations , and Yee had the late-added allegations expunged from his record . He resigned his commission last January , and received an honorable discharge . <p> In his new book For God and Country : Faith and Patriotism Under Fire ( PublicAffairs , 240 pp. $24 ) Yee recounts his experiences ministering to Muslim prisoners at Camp Delta and the legal nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone over to the other side . <p> A third-generation Chinese-American , Yee grew up in New Jersey . He converted to Islam in 1991 , when he was 23 , not long after graduating from West Point . Two of his brothers also serve in the U.S. military . Currently he 's finishing a master 's degree in international relations at Troy University . <p> During a recent visit to Houston , Yee talked about the experiences he describes in For God and Country . <p> Q : Why did you decide to write this book ? <p> A : First , what happened to me was clearly a gross miscarriage of justice . To be locked away for 76 days in isolation , to be arrested in secret , separated from your family , them not knowing where I was , being accused of spying , espionage , aiding the enemy and threatened with the death penalty - no one should be threatened with that . <p> The second is to inspire other people to struggle toward fundamental American principles of diversity , tolerance , religious freedom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current approach to fighting this so-called war on terrorism , that our administration 's approach is a threat to the civil liberties of everyday ordinary Americans like myself . If it can happen to me , a thirdgeneration Chinese-American whose family is deeply rooted in the military , a West Point graduate , someone who has patriotically served his nation , it can happen to anyone . <p> Q : What were your first impressions of Guantnamo ? <p> A : The first thing , when you get off the plane , you observe the humidity and the heat . But when you get in the prison camp , you learn it 's hot in a completely different sense , not in temperature but in the things that are going on inside Camp Delta - the level of tension , the level of intensity . <p> The first thing that happens is a full day of briefings . The briefing that stuck out with me was delivered by the counterintelligence people . They drill into you the idea that the guys being detained here are the people who had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a description of these people as being hardest of the hard-core terrorists . We 've heard these comments from Secretary Rumsfeld , from other senior Pentagon officials . <p> But when you get into the camp - and I had the unique position of interacting with prisoners on a personal level and perhaps was able to establish a relationship with them based on a shared faith - I had been more scared in state and federal prisons talking to Muslim prisoners than I ever was down in Guantnamo . <p> Q : If they were n't hardened terrorists , what kind of people were they ? <p> A : They 're fathers . They 're brothers . They 're sons . <p> They have mothers . They have family . They 're human beings . That 's the most important thing that has to be made clear . <p> Many of them did have a lot of anger against the United States , the United States government . Many of them had anger toward the guards because of the way they were being treated or mistreated and abused . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to serve the U.S. military . <p> So yes , they had anger . But if you 're caged in these cells and subjected to abuses on a daily basis , whether in the camp or in interrogation , that 's going to create a lot of anger . <p> When the anger rises to the level that prisoners are ready to cause riots and disturbances and even commit suicide in protest of how they and the religion of Islam were being treated , those problems needed to be resolved . And I was called upon . <p> Q : Are you saying these people are not a threat to the United States ? <p> A : Individually , no . <p> Q : They could all be sent back to wherever they came from ? <p> A : It was n't my role to determine guilt or innocence . It was said these people were picked up on the battlefield . But not all of them were picked up on the battlefield . <p> Perhaps some were , but that 's no different from our soldier , Pvt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much does that soldier know about what 's going on inside the Pentagon and what Donald Rumsfeld is doing ? The people down in Guantnamo know as much about the planning and carrying out of 9/11 and what Osama bin Laden is doing as that private knows what 's going on in the Pentagon . That 's the reality . <p> Perhaps several of them had picked up arms in defense of their families and communities against the largest military force in the world . Perhaps that 's the case with several of them . Clearly not all of them . <p> Q : You came to believe the American military was using Islam as a weapon against prisoners in Guantnamo . What do you mean by that ? <p> A : What little knowledge of Islam military personnel and senior leaders down in Guantnamo had was used against prisoners in a systematic way to break them . <p> For example , they learned how sacred the holy Koran is to the Muslim - the actual book . Mistreating or abusing the text is like mistreating or abusing or insulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest shelf in a person 's home , that 's why it 's never put in any place where there 's any dirt or filth . <p> We saw abuses of the Koran . We saw desecration of the Koran . <p> Guards , when I got down there , conducted cell searches as part of a routine prison operation . They were allowed physically to search the holy Koran , and they treated it like any other object - they would violently shake it see if anything dangerous would drop out ; nothing ever did . Sometimes the pages tore out , sometimes the bindings were ripped and cracked . When it was done in front of the prisoners , it infuriated them and caused disturbances . <p> Q : Was there one thing that happened that made you come under suspicion ? <p> A : Not one thing , but I was there day in and day out , in the cell blocks , getting a thorough understanding of that detention operation , interacting with prisoners . That 's how the camp commander wanted to employ me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how to resolve problems and make the detention side of the operation run a lot smoother . <p> Q : When you were arrested , did you think you 'd be cleared ? What was going through your mind ? <p> A : Yes , I thought , this is absurd , this is ridiculous , these ignorant people will see their mistake in a couple of days and I will be back at Guantnamo . But it turned out they were more ignorant than I thought and dragged this thing out and embarrassed themselves severely . <p> Q : They also charged you with adultery and downloading pornography . <p> A : Those charges clearly were brought for two purposes . One was to divert attention away from the real issue : that they made a mistake , a gross error , in handling my case . Because when did those charges come ? On the day I was released from prison . <p> They also really wanted to discredit me . They knew the amount of information I was forwarding to the command in my role as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredit me if I ever disclosed that information . <p> Q : What 's your feeling now about the American military ? <p> A : There needs to be a lot of work promoting principles of diversity and tolerance and religious freedom . Within the ranks of the military , religious issues are a growing problem , not only for Muslims but for other people of diverse faiths . <p> Q : You 're suggesting that disparaging remarks about Muslims damage the legitimate war against those who are trying to do us harm ? <p> A : Clearly . It helps the recruiting process for extremist organizations . It increases anti-American sentiment abroad . I do n't think there 's been any point in history when America was so much hated around the world . A lot of that is because of these negative attitudes toward minorities and people of diverse faiths and the policies that are being enacted that reflect those views . <p> It undermines efforts to spread American values abroad . <p> Q : Would you agree that al-Qaida does represent a threat to the United States ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to the United States but to anyone . And Islam does n't accept that . <p> Q : How would you fight the war against this extremist ideology ? <p> A : Education . Educate people about what Islam really is rather than portraying Islam as being this radical religion . That 's the first step . <p> FOR GOD AND COUNTRY : FAITH AND PATIOTISM UNDER FIRE <p> By James Yee with Aimee Molloy <p> PublicAffairs <p> 240 pages ; $24 <p> NOTES : fritz.lanham@chron.com 1 . JIMI LOTT : SEATTLE TIMES , 2 . DAVE MARTIN : ASSOCIATED PRESS , 4-5 . REUTERS , 6 . PHOTO BY Ben DeSoto , Chronicle , COVER DESIGN BY Ken Ellis , Chronicle @x IF YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING , YOU 'LL KEEP GETTING WHAT you are getting-or so I heard growing up , whenever I made the same mistake twice . So what are we doing with the U.S. economy ? Shedding jobs every month for the past year . Racking up public debt to the point that the incoming president will inherit from 3.8 to 5.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken financial institutions to the tune of billions a pop . Managing a mortgage crisis so severe it has worldwide ramifications . Watching bridges collapse and crossing our fingers that 150-year-old water mains do n't burst . Spending a trillion dollars on a war . If we keep it up , we 'll spend ourselves into second-class world economic status . Or , the next president can draw a line in the sand and say , " Enough . " The economy can be jump-started if our government decides to invest in the U.S. just as we have invested in countless other countries . To quote Sen. Hillary Clinton , " We can build hospitals in Baghdad , but not in Brooklyn . " Time to switch that around ! And time to recognize that an economic crisis affects women and people of color even more dramatically than everyone else , so special attention has to be drawn to those sectors . Here are some suggestions of how to redirect U.S. attention to our own crucial economic needs . 1 . Job creation , job creation , job creation As of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was far worse for African Americans ( 10.6 percent ) and Hispanics ( 8 percent ) . There are an estimated 2.6 seekers for every available job , so you can imagine the level of anxiety that many out-ofwork Americans are experiencing . If that does n't sound bad enough , the National Jobs for All Coalition says these numbers underestimate the unemployment rate-which it pegs at closer to 12.5 percent when you count those who have stopped looking for work . They estimate 10.5 million among the " hidden " unemployed , or 19.9 million jobless people total . But government can create jobs . We 've done it before , most notably during the Great Depression with the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) , and more recently ( 1973 to 1982 ) with the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act ( CETA ) . Imagine the libraries , child-care centers and health agencies that could benefit from programs like that today ! What would it cost ? If the government spent $50,000 per job ( that 's about $30,000 for salary , $10,000 for benefits and $10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 billion a year-a fraction of what we spend in Iraq in a month . Many of these jobholders would be taxpayers , lowering the net cost of the program . The Bush administration has already tried to provide economic stimuli by cutting taxes , sending small checks and bailing out corporations-why not try a stimulus that goes directly to working people and invests in our economy ? 2 . Make college more accessible and affordable . That would also boost the overall economy , as well as embracing our nation 's educational enterprise . The current maximum Pell Grantgiven by the federal government to low-income students-is $4,731 ; we should double that amount . What else can we do ? Exempt full-time students from paying federal income taxes . Develop tax provisions ( deductions , tax credits ) for nontraditional students who are returning to school when their jobs have been eliminated . Change bankruptcy laws to forgive student debt when people get into financial trouble . Allow student debt to be repaid by depositing a small percentage of current income into a revolving student loan fund . Those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fully in civic affairs and have lower unemployment rates . It 's especially important to provide educational access for those who have remained at the periphery of higher education , yet form an increasing proportion of our population-African Americans , Latinos and working-class people . ( The historically black colleges and universities-HBCUs-like the one at which I 'm president , have done quite a lot of heavy lifting in getting underserved students prepared for the labor market : We represent just 3 percent of our nation 's colleges , yet produce at least 14 percent of all African American graduates. ) 3 . Invest in infrastructure and public works . Bridges collapse , levees break , water mains leak : Deferred maintenance is beginning to catch up with us . We 're paying millions in injury and wrongful-death settlements that we could be spending to improve our fraying infrastructure . The physical status of our nation 's public schools-where the students are most likely to be black , brown or poor-is abysmal . What if the federal government committed to construct at least one state-of-the-art school in every major city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what about libraries ? Many urban public libraries have cut their public-access hours because of budget problems . Libraries should be modernized and available 24/7 ; they 're potentially hubs of information infrastructure , and an important source of Internet access for those on the wrong side of the digital divide . The green revolution can also be a job generator . Dollars invested greenly by the federal government can create lower and more responsible energy use . But when these infrastructure investments are made , it 's vital that the jobs they generate be fairly distributed . Infrastructure-related jobs have a tendency to favor white men , who are most likely to be building-trade workers . 4 . Start a National Health Initiative to provide better health standards , more health workers and more health-care access . In 2000 , one in eight Americans was over 65 ; by 2040 , one in five will be . An aging population puts greater demands on our nation 's health-care system . Providing national health care that covers everyone , investing in our health infrastructure and in training for medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a focus on healthy living standards , is a form of economic development . Healthy people are more productive , thus contributing to the economic bottom line , and preventive health care-available to few at the bottom end of the income spectrum-often saves dollars and lives . 5 . Give tax credits for low-income mortgage holders . Many low- and moderate-income mortgage holders are at risk to lose their homes because of predatory loan terms and economic hard times . A special tax credit that allows people to write off both interest and a portion of their principal will keep people in their homes and also encourage economic stability . The alternativeforeclosing on the poor-causes neighborhood instability and exacerbates the current housing crisis . How do we pay for all this ? Well , we found enough money to spend $12 billion a month in the war in Iraq . Plus , spending on investment reaps long-term returns . Finally , and most importantly , there are often good reasons to assume debt . Each of us does it when we do n't pay the full price for a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we anticipate that investment will yield both human and economic returns . The bottom line is that we can drift into a second-class world status , or engage all of our citizens in a productive economy .
