The Taliban likes to portray itself as just , resolute and pure . But accounts coming out of Kabul these days depict it in a very different light  --  as corrupt , abusive and , with expectations of a U.S. attack mounting , increasingly vindictive . Dust-caked refugees fleeing the capital say streets are sealed off and soldiers go from house to house , press-ganging men of military age . " There is a jihad against the Americans going on . Why are n't you fighting ? " the Taliban asked Kandaqa , a worker from Kabul , last week . He pledged his house as surety , then collected his family and fled across the mountains . <P> Northern Alliance officials continue to paint a rosy picture of a regime on the verge of collapse . Over cups of tea in their calm command posts or in small mud houses near the dozy front , they assure visitors that Taliban morale is nosediving , that desertions are widespread . Checking such assertions can be bewildering . A group of journalists spent a day looking for the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were told he could not be reached because he was at the front line working the radios , calling on his former colleagues to surrender . Many hours later , he was tracked down in a bazaar . He , the commander to whom he had surrendered and a dozen or so other fighters had poured themselves into a taxi to go off and do some shopping . The deserter turned out to be a shopkeeper from northern Afghanistan named Khan Jan who had been conscripted three months earlier . <P> There are some serious people in the Northern Alliance , however , and their picture of the Taliban is more sobering . These people  --  intelligence officers , security officials and spies  --  do not think the Taliban resistance in Kabul will collapse at the first U.S. salvo . A Northern Alliance fighter who has viewed the Taliban up close is Saif , a tense , nervy man in his 30s who is a spy for one of the alliance commanders . When he was interviewed last week , he had just spent 10 days or so in Kabul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000 hardened fighters in the city , Saif says . Their commander is Mullah Obaidullah , the Defense Minister . Obaidullah is a formidable adversary , says Mohammed Aref , chief of staff of a regiment on the front line facing Kabul . Officials and soldiers on this side who are in contact with the Taliban  --  spies , escapees or front-line officers who sometimes talk to their opponents by radio  --  say their enemy 's morale is higher than Northern Alliance spokesmen would like to believe . The Taliban reaction to the attacks in the U.S. was a mixture of jubilation and fatalism , Northern Alliance officials say . " At last we have fd the Americans " were the words Khan Jan recalled hearing . This mood was replaced briefly , in Kabul at least , by panic at the first talk of anticipated U.S. strikes . Then after four days or so , Northern Alliance intelligence officials say , the Taliban recovered its composure and returned to the task of defending the city .               @ @ @ @ @ @
