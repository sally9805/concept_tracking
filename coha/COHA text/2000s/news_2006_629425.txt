<p> The three analysts suspended because of the latest findings in the Houston crime-lab investigation have been targeted for discipline previously or cited for errors in their work , but escaped serious punishment , the Houston Chronicle found in reviewing personnel records . <p> Houston Police Department supervisors suspended Mary Childs-Henry , Joseph Chu and Raynard Cockrell after an independent team of experts found they had failed to report evidence that could have helped defendants and that they made errors in DNA and serology tests . <p> HPD had attempted to discipline the three longtime crime-lab employees for mistakes that ranged from bungling evidence in a capital murder case to failing to cooperate with internal investigations of the crime-lab debacle . Each time , the analysts received reduced punishment after appealing to a review panel . <p> In fact , most other crime-lab employees who have appealed disciplinary action in the three years since HPD 's forensic work first came under scrutiny also have succeeded - even Christy Kim , the analyst fired for her shoddy work in the wrongful rape conviction of Josiah Sutton . They largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individual analysts did not have the power to correct them . <p> The difficulty in firing Kim , who won reinstatement and then retired , angered Mayor Bill White and Police Chief Harold Hurtt . Both expressed hope last week that any future discipline of crime-lab employees will not be overturned . <p> " In public safety , part of the standard for performance should be based on the credibility of the people involved , " White said . " And for certain functions , there should not be any doubts . I do not want a guilty person to escape the judgment of a jury because of some attack by a skillful criminal defense attorney on the records of any individual at the crime lab . " <p> The panel that heard analysts ' appeals , the three-member city Civil Service Commission , is appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the City Council .

Serology , the analysis of body fluids , was a precursor to DNA testing . <p> After he was briefed on the investigators ' findings , Hurtt moved to suspend the analysts with pay and opened an internal probe into whether they should be disciplined . <p> Cockrell and Chu declined to comment to the Chronicle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the team of experts reviewing cases for independent investigator Michael Bromwich , Childs-Henry reported that DNA tests in the 1995 sexual assault case against Garland Davis were inconclusive when , in fact , they excluded him as a contributor to samples of evidence from the crime scene . <p> Childs-Henry , who has worked in the lab for 13 years , performed a highly discriminating DNA analysis on two evidence samples collected with a rape kit and one from the victim 's clothes , the investigators reported . She obtained strong results indicating the presence of a male - but not Davis - on all three samples , the experts said . <p> Rather than report those findings , however , Childs-Henry said she obtained no results , the investigators said . <p> In the same case , Chu used a less-discriminating DNA test and obtained results that may have included Davis as a suspect , investigators said . Those results were reported as definitively including him , according to the report , with no mention of the other , more discriminating and exculpatory findings . <p> Davis pleaded guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experts also said that Chu overstated the strength of his test results in a capital murder case and a sexual assault case .

Childs-Henry had samples for more than three months before she analyzed them and was unable to obtain results when she did , according to a memo by a crime-lab supervisor . <p> Jones was released after another analyst performed tests that eliminated him as a suspect , but his ordeal prompted then-Police Chief Sam Nuchia to order an audit . <p> More recently , the Police Department attempted to suspend Childs-Henry for three days in 2004 because she improperly packaged evidence from a rape kit and " possibly cross-contaminated evidence , " according to the letter notifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was following lab protocols , the Civil Service Commission reduced her suspension to a written reprimand . <p> Chu , a 16-year crime-lab veteran , faced a 14-day suspension in 2003 for a variety of errors , such as botched statistical calculations , in four cases including two capital murders .

As we toured the little chapel in the house where I lived , she asked me , " Where 's Joseph ? " I was taken aback ; there was no trace of the saint in the chapel at all . Later I showed her a small stone statue of Joseph in the yard behind the house ( set up by one of the brothers named Joseph ) , which always had a candle burning before it . She was not very satisfied . Joseph receives little attention these days , even in Advent . But if we read the infancy narratives carefully , we find that Joseph stands with Mary at center stage . In fact , whereas Mary is the heroine in Luke 's story of Jesus ' birth and childhood , in Matthew 's account Joseph has the primary role . During Advent , the church encourages us to reflect on this great man , who accompanied Mary through life . What can Joseph 's life teach believers ? Folk Tales About Joseph Most of what we commonly say about Joseph comes from apocryphal literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament canon . In these stories , popular imagination fills the vacuum left by the Gospels ' lack of historical detail about Joseph with delightful tales . There is Joseph the old man , for instance . In paintings , nativity scenes and Christmas plays , St. Joseph is usually portrayed as quite old , a grandfatherly figure in the stable at Bethlehem , or an elderly man with a flowering staff or , in deathbed scenes , a grey-haired patriarch whom Jesus and a young Mary stand by and console . Yet the Scriptures offer no evidence of Joseph 's advanced age , and they give no details whatsoever about the time or place of his birth or death . Instead , these ideas come from The Protoevangelium of James , one of the most influential of the apocrypha . Written around the middle of the second century , The Protoevangelium attempted to reconcile Mary 's virginity with scriptural references to Jesus ' " brothers . " As explanation , the writing imagines Joseph as an old widower with children who was appointed to be the 12 - year- old Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovered over his head in the presence of the high priest . Nowhere has the popular imagination about Joseph flourished more than in stories about the Holy Family 's flight into Egypt . Coptic legends have Joseph sailing hundreds of miles down the Nile , fleeing with his family . Other stories tell of miracles that made the journey easier : palm trees bowed down to feed the family with their fruit ; lions and leopards , instead of attacking them , wagged their tails in homage to Jesus . At Hermopolis , 175 miles south of Cairo , the idols of the pagan temple fell down as Joseph led the family through . Fifty miles farther south , near Kuskam - where Joseph and the family are said to have stayed six months - two robbers accosted them , but one , upon seeing Mary 's tears , repented . According to the legend , these were the robbers later crucified with Jesus ; the one who repented was the " good thief . " Art has illustrated these legends . Caravaggio 's " Rest on the Flight into Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays the violin , lulling Mary and Jesus to sleep . Filippo Lippi , Bartolomeo Murillo and Georges de la Tour painted similar scenes . The Syriac-Arabic Infancy Gospel and other apocrypha add further embellishments to the story of Joseph 's fife . Joseph the carpenter makes plows , yokes and other tools for farmers , as well as wooden beds for homes . At age 40 he marries Melcha ( some stories call her Escha ) , and during their 49 years of marriage they have four sons and two daughters . Joseph encounters Mary after he has been widowed for one year . The annunciation takes place two years later . Joseph , it is written , is out searching for a midwife when Jesus is born . A final apocryphal work worth noting is the fourth-century Story of Joseph the Carpenter . This tale imagines Jesus working side by side with Joseph in the carpenter 's shop and later treats Joseph 's last days . Strong and alert until the age of 111 , Joseph falls ill and confesses his sins on his deathbed , where he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archangels Michael and Gabriel to take Joseph 's soul . The Historical Joseph The early church rejected these texts , even though they have some value as literary expressions of the popular religious imagination . Today we too recognize that many of these apocryphal stories are much too fantastic to be regarded as historical . Given the scarcity of relevant historical detail in the New Testament , we are left with only a general outline about Joseph . It can be argued that he was of the lineage of David , at least in a broad sense . There is evidence that he came from either Bethlehem or Nazareth . He labored as a woodworker , a trade in which Jesus followed him . His language was a Palestinian dialect of Aramaic , though he probably knew enough Greek to bargain and write receipts in his trade . Most likely he also understood some Hebrew , which he heard read aloud in the synagogue . According to the New Testament , Joseph became legally betrothed to Mary , probably when she was very young , which was the custom at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mysterious pregnancy , and became Jesus ' legal father . He was just , upright and devoted to the Law , but compassionate in its interpretation . He accompanied Mary during die events surrounding the birth of Jesus and into the early years of Jesus ' life . He settled the family in Nazareth . With Mary , he would have tended to Jesus ' religious education . By the time of Jesus ' public ministry , however , Joseph had disappeared completely . Apparendy he had died by this time , though we have no details about his death . A Subject for Meditation Year after year the church presents Joseph as a subject for meditation , especially during Advent . Three facets of the New Testament picture of Joseph merit our attention . First , a central Gospel theme : Joseph , like Mary , listened to the word of God and acted on it . In the Gospels Joseph never speaks . But in Matthew , God speaks to Joseph at four critical moments in the history of Jesus , and in each instance , Joseph immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to take Mary as his wife , Joseph receives her into his home . Upon being told he should take Jesus and his mother and flee to Egypt , Joseph leaves that very night . So , too , he later returns to Israel upon the direction of the angel . And when Joseph is warned in a dream not to go to Judea , he immediately changes course and settles the family in Galilee . His persistently faithful response to God 's commands parallels the presentation of Mary in the Gospel of Luke . Both know how to " listen to the word of God and act upon it . " Second , in Matthew 's Gospel Joseph is brought before the transcendent mystery of God again and again , some- times with hesitation but always with alertness , and he faces it with faith . Surely Joseph can not fathom the virginal con- ception of Jesus . But from the darkness of his own limited understanding , he responds to the mystery of God with awe and acceptance , tempering his strict observance of the Law with loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can not possibly understand how this child , who seems like any other , could be " God with us , " but in faith Joseph abandons himself to the task of loving the child and educating him . Third , Joseph 's life was steeped in daily dealings with the world around him ; he was not set apart . Indeed , the life of the Holy Family at Nazareth was far from the idyllic monastery-like existence we sometimes imagine . Joseph was a woodworker , a neighborhood craftsman who made furniture and carved other objects , and spent time apprenticing his son in the same trade . Like many believers over the course of history , Joseph walked with God as a family man , laboring in his shop and living at home with Mary and Jesus . He combined prayer , hard work and the responsibilities of being a husband and father . This year especially , after the Synod of Bishops on the Word of God , the church urges us to renew our love for the word of God . For Joseph , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paramount . His example challenges us to ask ourselves : Is the word of God really central for us , as it was for him ? Is it water that gives us Ufe when our hearts and minds are dry ( Isaiah ) ? Is it a hammer to knock us loose when we are too set to budge ( Jeremiah ) ? Is it food sweeter than honey for those times when life tastes bitter ( Psalms ) ? Is it a two-edged sword , which when applied to others cuts us , too ( Hebrews ) ? Advent is upon us . Imagine how Joseph felt as the birth of his mysterious son approached : puzzled , excited , awed . Yet in his puzzlement , the word of God was his strength . Deep faith gave him light in the darkness and enabled him to see the presence of God in a world where suffering , privation and violence appeared to reign .
