Charles Birnbaum is a man making a difference . He is also a man with a peeve : " We have cultural amnesia when it comes to landscapes , " he says . " We need to cherish them not just as beautiful places but as historic treasures . " Through his professional training and work as a landscape architect on preservation projects , Birnbaum became aware that designed outdoor spaces often fall into a no-man's-land . They 're largely ignored by art and architectural historians , who are primarily interested in bricks and mortar , and often misunderstood by garden lovers and environmentalists , who value their beauty but fail to appreciate their significance as part of our heritage .
