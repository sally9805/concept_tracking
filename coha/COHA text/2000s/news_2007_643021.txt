<p> THE federal tax code is so complex that many people who can scarcely afford to put food on the table end up leaving money on the table at tax time . <p> Nancy Duff Campbell , co-president of the National Women 's Law Center in Washington , said Internal Revenue Service studies show that many people are unaware of tax breaks to which they are entitled  --  sometimes adding up to thousands of dollars  --  or do not know how to get them . <p> Often , a simple , straightforward approach will cost a taxpayer money . For example , a single mother using common sense might declare herself as single on the most basic tax form , the 1040EZ  --  unaware that she is eligible for the more generous status of " head of household " or that she may be able to claim several tax credits , but only if she uses a different form . <p> These omissions can be costly . If she earned $27,000 , for example , and had no other income , she would owe taxes of $2,401 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed a Form 1040 or 1040A as head of household , after a standard deduction of $7,550 and two exemptions , totaling $6,600 , for herself and her child , the tax would be $1,394 . Then , after a $1,000 child credit and a $795 earned income credit , she would get a refund of $401 . That 's a net difference of $2,800  --  more than 10 percent of her annual income . <p> The law center has begun a campaign to educate eligible low- and moderate-income families about taxes , focusing on these three federal credits for families : <p> The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit , which has a maximum value of $2,100 this year . It offsets some of the expenses that families incur in order to work . <p> The Earned Income Tax Credit , which has a maximum value of $4,536 this year . It helps provide a wage supplement for families with earnings of less than $38,348 . <p> The Child Tax Credit , which has a maximum value of $1,000 a child this year . It offsets some of the costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be challenging for anyone . Donna LeValley , a tax lawyer who is a contributing editor of " J. K. Lasser 's Your Income Tax 2007 , " ( Wiley &; Sons ) characterized the code as broken . " It just lurches along , " she said . " It 's going to have to be cleaned up . " But it is the code Americans must use , so she and other experts offered tips in various categories for filing and planning ahead:RECENT TAX CHANGES  --  When filing for 2006 , Ms. LeValley said , taxpayers should be aware that in late December three expired tax breaks were extended , but 2006 tax forms had already been printed , so the Internal Revenue Service issued a series of codes for claiming the breaks . They are : <p> State and Local General Sales Tax Deduction . Taxpayers were given the option of deducting sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes for 2004 and 2005 . This helped people in states that do not impose income taxes , as well as some residents of other states who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been extended for 2006 and 2007 . To claim it on Schedule A of Form 1040 , write " ST " on the dotted line to the left of Line 5 , " State and local income taxes . " <p> Higher-Education Tuition and Fees Deduction . This can be claimed on Form 1040 , Line 35 , " Domestic production activities deduction . " Write " T " in the space to the left of that line . If claiming deductions for both domestic production activities  --  a term applicable to a wide variety of manufacturing , production , growing and extraction work  --  and tuition and fees , write " B " and attach a breakdown showing the amounts claimed for each . <p> Educator Expense Adjustment to Income . Teachers , classroom aides , counselors , principals and other educators can deduct up to $250 for classroom supplies . On Line 23 of Form 1040 , " Archer MSA Deduction , " write " E " on the dotted line to the left of that line entry or " B " if claiming both an Archer medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , attach a breakdown for each . <p> That same law allows a tax credit of up to $5,000 for taxpayers who had to pay alternative minimum tax on what has been called phantom income , Ms. LeValley said . Many employees of technology companies , for example , exercised incentive stock options during the boom years of the 1990s and had to pay an A.M.T. liability on the difference between the exercise price and the market price . Later , if the market prices plunged , the tax law did not allow them to reclaim the tax they had paid . <p> While the new credit addresses the problem , it is extremely complex . Taxpayers who want to claim it may want to consult a tax professional . <p> Other changes enacted last year will also affect 2007 returns , she said . For example , to deduct any cash contributions to charities , substantiation like canceled checks , credit-card records or receipts will now be needed ; receipts will be required for any single gift of $100 or more . <p> Also new for 2007 , Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it begins to phase out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $100,000 . KIDDIE TAX AND FAMILY GIFTS  --  Despite its name , the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act , which was passed in May , actually imposed a tax increase on many parents of children aged 14 to 17 . That 's because , retroactive to Jan. 1 , 2006 , the age limit for the so-called kiddie tax was raised to 18 from 14 . The change means that earnings above $1,700 on investments held by children under 18 are taxable at the parents ' rate , which is generally higher than the children 's . <p> This change complicates a basic strategy used by many parents and grandparents who put money into older children 's accounts to save for college . Often , they give appreciated securities to teenagers  --  an individual may give up to $12,000 each this year to any number of people with no gift or estate tax consequences . If both husband and wife give , the gifts to one person could total $24,000 . <p> The idea is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the resulting capital gains tax at the youths ' lower tax rate , generally 5 percent instead of 15 percent . <p> With the kiddie tax change , a Section 529 savings plan becomes more attractive , said Sidney Kess , a New York lawyer and accountant . After-tax money goes into a 529 plan , and the distributions are tax-free when used for qualified educational expenses . Some states offer additional tax benefits . The plans were made permanent by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 , which was enacted in August . <p> If a child is nearly 18 , though , a simple gift may be advantageous , he said , because from 2008 to 2010 , taxpayers in the regular 10 percent or 15 percent tax brackets for earned income will owe no tax at all on qualified dividend income  --  dividends on most domestic stocks are qualified  --  and long-term capital gains . <p> The same strategy can be used by people who are supporting elderly relatives , he said . <p> In the 10 or 15 percent bracket , " in 2007 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be untaxed , " Mr. Kess said . " In addition , dividend income up to $31,850 will be taxed only at 5 percent . In 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , there will be no tax on that dividend income . " ADOPTION CREDIT  --  Thanks to another credit of interest to many families , said Stephen R. Buschel , a tax partner in the New York office of the accounting firm BDO Seidman , up to $10,960 can be claimed for qualified adoption expenses . <p> Eligibility begins to phase out for a married couple filing jointly when adjusted gross income reaches $164,410 and ends when A.G.I. reaches $204,410 . Credits offset taxes dollar for dollar , making them more valuable than deductions . Mr. Buschel noted that the credit could pay for a lot of diapers and formula. ##
