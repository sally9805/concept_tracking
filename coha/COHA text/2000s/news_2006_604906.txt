<p> Every month there 's a cheering , weeping , air-horn-tooting celebration at First Assembly of God in North Little Rock , Ark. , when the Rev. Rod Loy immerses new believers in the baptismal tank . <p> " This is a sign that someone understands the ideas of sin and Christ 's sacrifice and willfully chooses to be a lifelong follower of Jesus , " says the pastor . " So we celebrate it big . " <p> For believers , baptism is modeled on their savior , who the Bible says waded into the water to consecrate himself to God . <p> They may be sprinkled , washed from a flowing pitcher or immersed , as faith rituals vary . But all forms point to beliefs : rebirth in faith , salvation from sin , acceptance of God 's promises and charges . <p> For parents who bring a baby before their church , baptism is a pledge of their faith , a shield against evil , a wrapping of communal arms around a defenseless soul . <p> For Christians of all denominations , " even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other time in their life ... there 's a tendency to hold onto this life-cycle marker , " says the Rev. Paul Sullins , a sociologist at Catholic University in Washington , D.C. <p> Yet , this Easter , the holy day of resurrection , statistics find Americans slowly drifting away from the ancient baptismal ritual . <p> The Catholic Church has more than doubled in size in the past half-century , but its rate of infant baptism steadily has fallen , Sullins says . <p> Methodists and Lutherans have seen both baptisms and their membership numbers slide for years . <p> Even Loy 's denomination , the Assemblies of God , which has had a boom in membership since 1980 , saw its annual baptism numbers peak in 1997 , then inch downward . <p> The Southern Baptist Convention has seen a half-century decline in baptisms and stalled growth in membership . <p> In response , the Rev. Bobby Welch , president of the Southern Baptist Convention , is leading a national campaign to reverse the trend . <p> Behind the drop , experts see pressures ranging from fewer babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , to more " seeker churches " that downplay tradition . <p> Among Catholics , Sullins says , the rate of baptisms has fallen faster than the rate of decline in births . <p> Baptism is n't the only source of new members . The church 's U.S. numbers  --  up from 31.6 million in 1954 to 67.8 million last year  --  also have grown through immigration . And at Saturday 's Easter vigil , the church will receive tens of thousands of adult converts . <p> The sociologist also links fewer infant baptisms to two trends involving marriage . Fewer Catholics are choosing to marry in the church , and Sullins says they may be less " attached to the sacraments . " And , since a change in church law in 1983 , Catholics who marry non-Catholics no longer must promise to baptize and rear their children as Catholics . <p> Intermarriage slows baptisms <p> Now the church requires only " a general recognition by the couple that the Catholic partner 's faith will be respected . " <p> " The more you see more inter-faith marriages or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , the more you will see baptism taper off , " says the Rev. James Martin , associate editor of the Jesuit magazine America and author of My Life with the Saints . <p> " I know friends who themselves are strongly Catholic but who married people inimical to the church , and it 's hard to agree on what they should do with their baby . At the very least , it delays baptism . The more delayed , the less likely it is to happen at all , " he says . <p> All the denominations that emphasize infant baptism , such as Catholics , Methodists and Lutherans , struggle with a contemporary culture that rejects the very idea that humanity is born into sin or that parents should steer children 's spiritual development , says the Rev. Gayle Carlton Felton , author of the United Methodist Church 's statement on baptism theology and practice , This Gift of Water . <p> Methodists " no longer literally believe that baptism removes the burden of sin that would send a child to hell , " Felton says . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim on the child 's life . <p> " Something real is happening in a baptism , " Felton says . " For mainline liturgical churches , the actor here is God , claiming that child for his own . It does n't matter if the child remembers it . God does . " <p> Denominations that baptize only believers  --  older kids and adults who profess change of heart and want to witness this with an outward sign  --  also are seeing a decline . <p> The Southern Baptist Convention has seen its rate of baptism fall about 35% from 1972 to 1985 , midway through a decade when the denomination was torn by dissension over an ultra-conservative leadership takeover . <p> Then the rate stalled for the next 20 years , even though Baptists are pledged to heed the Bible 's " great commission " in Matthew 28:19-20 : " Go , therefore , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit , and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Welch 's baptism campaign bus last fall , Welch told him just 40% of Southern Baptist Convention converts were truly unchurched before . " What that means is that we 're not reaching the pagan pool . ... We 're just rearranging the furniture inside the church . " <p> Unlike the slow-growing Southern Baptist Convention , the Assemblies of God 's number of adherents grew from nearly 1.8 million in 1980 to nearly 2.8 million in 2004 . But the total number of baptisms by immersion in water or by the Holy Spirit  --  experiencing the gift of speaking in tongues , one of the denomination 's distinctly Pentecostal beliefs  --  has hovered from around 175,000 to 200,000 yearly . <p> If baptism is the door into a faith , where did all those people go ? <p> Like Welch , the Rev. George Wood , general secretary of the Assemblies of God , sees Christians play musical chairs , looking for the right fit in theology , worship style and ministry services . " At the church where I pastored years ago in Orange County , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mobility in the culture , " Wood says . And , he adds , not all new or reborn faith takes root . <p> Today , some parents refuse to plant it at all . <p> There are now baptism-style ceremonies where God is never mentioned by parents seeking to initiate their children into a world of all faiths , says Ema Drouillard of San Francisco , who runs the website Ceremonyway.com . <p> She conducted such an event for Kirsten and Farnum Alston of Marin County , Calif. , for their baby , Greer , in 1998 . " We just wanted a larger spirit to guide our daughter , but we did n't want to get specific . I wanted all her bases covered , " says Kirsten Alston . The couple grew up Presbyterian , but now " we just do Christianity L-I-T-E " for Greer , who " believes in angels and fairies , leprechauns and Santa Claus . " <p> Non-traditional paths to God <p> Churches in the ' 90s began actively courting church-wary people . These " seeker " churches often de-emphasized strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to baptisms . <p> " We focused so much on the personal decision , the big deal of turning your life over to Christ , that the public , external identification  --  baptism  --  was less important in practice , " says the Rev. Brian McLaren , who co-founded the non-denominational Cedar Ridge Community Church in Spencerville , Md . <p> Yet McLaren , who retired in January to write and lecture , sees change in the air , particularly when he looks at young church leaders such as the Rev. Rob Bell , 35 , who Christianity Today once said " puts the hip in discipleship . " <p> At Bell 's non-denominational Mars Hill Bible Church in Grandville , Mich. , where 12,000 worshipers gather weekly in a former mall , they roll in a portable tank every few weeks so baptismal candidates can witness their conversion to the whole congregation . " We are baptizing more people than ever , " because " people are desperate for something ancient and lasting and meaningful , " Bell says . <p> Even if baptisms are n't rising in numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Baptism is " a commitment to a lifelong spiritual practice , a discipleship , not a one-time event .
