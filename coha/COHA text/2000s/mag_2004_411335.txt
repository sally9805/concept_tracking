From flighty young Annie Hall to fiftysomething icon ( and mom ) , Diane Keaton makes a big comeback with her Best Actress nomination // With two young children and a career to keep going , Diane Keaton is usually up at 5 every morning in her comfy Spanish-style home in Los Angeles . " That 's the time I have for myself , " she says . " Once I have my coffee , it 's the best moment of my life . " So on Jan. 27 she 'd been sipping a cup and noodling around on the computer for half an hour when friend Carolyn Barber , her assistant on the blockbuster comedy Something 's Got ta Give , called with news that she 'd just been nominated for a Best Actress Oscar-just two days after taking home a Golden Globe . " Of course I was thrilled , " says Keaton . So are audiences . Over the past quarter century or so , the 58-year-old actress has been aging-without help from plastic surgery-from Woody Allen 's gorgeous , goofy muse to middle-aged wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The First Wives Club . Something 's Got ta Give , about the romance between two glamorous people eligible for AAEP membership , is a consciousness-raising return to the spotlight for the actress , who in recent years has been drifting away from performing and into directing and producing . " I was moving toward maybe acting once a year in a cable movie , " she says . Well , to quote Annie Hall : " La-de-da . " Something 's Got ta Give has brought her back , and reminded audiences of Keaton 's inimitably breezy style . Jack Nicholson , her costar in the film , says he was surprised at her knack for seduction : " Every once in a while , " he says , " warming up for the love scenes , she 'd say , " I love you , " and , man , I 'll tell you , I believed it . I did n't know whether I was going to be engaged to her at dinner or what . " In Something 's Got ta Give , starring Keaton as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even dared to do her first ever full nude scene . " I slapped the makeup on and went out there , " says Keaton , who turns the brief bit into a minor masterpiece of physical comedy . " She has a great figure , as the world now knows , " says the film 's writer-director , Nancy Meyers , a longtime friend who wrote the role with Keaton in mind . " She looks fantastic . " Yet Keaton does n't claim to have any special regimen ( " I do no exercise . None . I 'm thin because I 'm anxious ! " ) or beauty secrets ( " I wash my face , put on some cream " ) . She loathes the idea of plastic surgery , " but you never know . Every time I say I 'm not doing something I do it . I was never going to have premarital sex when I was 15 .... Well , forget it . In theory I think it 's best , probably , to try and be the best authentic person you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time has n't taken the fizz out of Keaton 's oddball charm-coltish figure , sad eyes , dazzling smile , strange clothes-but the never-married mother of two adopted children , daughter Dexter , 8 , and son Duke , 3 , is in private much more grounded than her famously twittery persona , which was on full display at the Golden Globes . That night she called herself " a rediscovered eccentric , " but " Diane is not in the least bit flaky or flighty , " says Meyers . " People confuse individuality with flighty . Flaky would be the last word in the world you 'd use to describe Diane . " Nicholson sums her up in two words : " Idiosyncratically brilliant . " Consider her range of interests : She 's also a photographer , movie producer ( Elephant ) , director of films ( Unstrung Heroes ) and TV episodes ( Twin Peaks ) . She 's an architecture buff and home renovator : She did such an expert job fixing up a 1920 shouseby famed L.A. architect Wallace Neff that Madonnabought it for $6.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Amanda Peet , who plays her daughter in Something 's Got ta Give . On the set , " she would have , like , eight papers under her arm , The New York Times first and foremost . She would get enraged about a headline and shout , " Get this ! " " Keaton , an L.A. native and the oldest of four siblings , credits her success-in everything-not to brains but diligence . She learned that value from her father , Jack Hall , a civil engineer who died of a brain tumor in 1990 . " My dad was slow , " she says . " He always said to me , " Diane , I 'm slow , but I 'm going to keep axtrying . ' I am my dad 's daughter in that regard . " Her mother , Dorothy Hall , seems to have planted the talent : " Secretly in her heart of hearts she probably wanted to be an entertainer of some kind , " says Keaton . " She sang . She played the piano . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's her turn to raise children . " It 's just about the most completely humbling experience I 've ever had . You try hard , but of course you always make mistakes . Being a parent reminds me that I 'm not special . " Then again , " when you see her drop her kids off at school and she 's wearing a bowler hat , gloves , boots that come up to her kneecaps and a poodle skirt ... I find that interesting , " says her friend , actress Sarah Paulson , laughing . When her kids visited the Something 's Got ta Give set , recalls Meyers , " Diane would drive Duke around on a golf cart . I 'd see them at lunch going " Wheee ! ' ' " Her love life is apparently much quieter . ( " The fact that my body functions is what I 'm really thrilled with now , " she told the Associated Press . ) Once she made headlines with high-profile romances that included Allen ( who directed her in seven movies ) , Al Pacino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatty ( her director and costar in Reds , for which she earned the second of her four Best Actress nominations ) . " To be transported by love is fabulous , " she says . But-when again ? " Next question . " And she laughs at the idea of ever dating ayounger man , as she does in Got ta Give , in which Nicholson 's unexpected rival is a doctor played by Keanu Reeves . " It 's not an issue . It 's not going to happen . " And the Oscar ? She wo n't know until Feb. 29 . Until then , she has her routine : " I 've got to pick up the kids and run around like a chicken with its head cut off . I collapse at 9 p.m . I 'm like a farmer woman . " A farmer in boots . And a bowler hat . And gloves .
