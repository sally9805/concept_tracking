Rich Mueller published a handful of stories in F &.SP; back in the 1980s , then let Hollywood 's siren call lure him into writing for television , particularly animation . ( Henotes with bemusement that a character named after him once appeared on The A-Team.j While he still lives in Hollywood , he 's back to writing prose and recently published a children " s book entitled Zoonauts : The secret of Animalville . His new story for us , much like Sheila Finch 's tale in this issue , takes us to thehigh seas and the results are very dark and powerful . <p> I FOUND BROUSSART huddled over the farthest table , where the crooked stone wall makes a turn and seabirds sometimes perch to watch for opportunities among the diners. he had placed his Capitaine 's coat on the wall to keep the gulls at bay and was mulling over a disreputable stack of papers held down against the breeze by a heavy piece of dark metal , a fist-sized gear of polished steel . " Souvenir ? " I asked . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazza . " The colonial sloop Savorgnan de Brazza had been Broussart 's last ship . When the Free French Navy had run out of steam and shut down , Broussart was promoted to Capitaine , beached , and given the choice of release in Mauritius or transportation back to metropolitan France . Since the only ships going to France these days were German or Vichy , Broussart decided to become a Mauritian . The last I had heard he was working with the British as a liaison officer but , being French , he seldom spoke of such things . ( " Liaison to what exactly ? " I asked . " Ah ha , yes , you see perfectly , " he replied . ) Liaison , of course , meaning intelligence . As I opened the chess board , Broussart shuffled the papers together and jammed them into a patch pocket on his coat . His " reports . " I thought this was pretty shabby for an intelligence officer . " You 've never heard of a briefcase ? " I asked , turning the gear over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it were responsible for controlling and moving many other gears . A Chief Engineer of gears . Broussart sniffed . " Briefcases cost money . " " A paper bag then . " " Undignified . " " Suit yourself . " I laid out the pieces on the board : black for Broussart , white for me . Broussart always played black , claiming that he was part Negro . he also claimed to be part Jew , part Gypsy , part Slav , part anything else that the Germans hated . " I won last time , " I said , " so first move to the French . " " I am only part French . " " Yeah , I know . " We played five or six desultory moves , unsettled and tentative , as the fishing boats moved in and out of Port Louis and patrolling Warwicks watched the sea . It was only 130 miles to Reunion where the swastikatricolor flew . The peace that kept the intervening waters quiet was little more than a pause , a breathless truce that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is elsewhere . " " Always , " he said . " Must be nice . " I took a knight . Broussart shrugged , sniffed , and turned his eyes seaward . A whiff of diesel smoke . I caught it too . " One of yours ? " I followed his gaze . A submarine was blowing its tanks near the outer buoy . As the water streamed from her conning tower , a helicopter swooped low over the deck . A pilot boat and a Fairmile launch were also racing to meet it . " Australian , I think . An ? - class . I did n't know that any of the big ones were out here . " Mauritius was the last westward dot of the British Pacific Empire , existing only by dint of the truce . If Germany decided she had built up enough venom for another strike , this island would be the first to go , and an American base here would n't stop it . We played a few more rounds . The world had been at a general peace for eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep : never at rest , a rat 's nest of interlocking treaties and truces . Undeclared peace and dormant war . As executive officer of the U.S. S. Unicom , I spent most of my time patrolling the waters between Cape Agulhas and Dondra Head . We were supposed to be a deterrent to the Germans and their territorial ambition , not that there was that much territory in the Indian Ocean left to protect . South Afrika and India had each declared their independence and everything in the vast arc between them was either Pan-Arab , Deutsch-Afrikan , Vichy French or seething in some complicated tribal anarchy . Only Mauritius and Ceylon were still held by the British , and though President Dewey had sworn to continue the Grand Alliance and back the British defense of the remaining free world , Americans had grown tired of the war . Treaties sworn , promised , and whispered were bound to disappear ; but until they did we were still here . The breeze turned round from the south , picked up a knot or two of strength , and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Broussart seemed oblivious to the cold . he was probably part Eskimo as well . he studied the pieces , smoking continuously and humming under his breath . " Have you been to Madagascar , Andre ? " " Yes . Many times . " " What 's it like ? " " Big , hot , nasty . Full of monkeys and Jews . " The Germans had been resettling the Jews there since shortly after the fall of France . Two million at last count , if you believed the statements of Herr Doktor Goebbels , which most of us did not . " You believe about the Jews ? " " Yes , as you know - " " You 're part Jewish , yeah , " I said . " But you have n't been there since the Boche arrived . " " But I have . " I looked at Broussart. he seemed entirely serious , yet he did not appear to be the sort of agent who would be landed from a submarine in the dead of night . More like a railway station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the cease fire when you were still based in Australia . There was a Truce Commission for the Indian Ocean area . It met at Diego Suarez . The British put a Royal Navy uniform on me and took me along as interpreter to deal with the Vichy . The Germans were very proper ; stiff . You know what they 're like . They confined us to the port district but the town was busy , productive , and full of Jews . " " You could tell ? " Broussart shrugged . " They looked Jewish , I think . Shabby , downcast , yet defiant in that way they have . They wore the yellow star . Their relations with the Germans were ... " " Friendly ? " " Hardly . Proper and correct . I saw no brutality or even coercion . More like the British here ; pleasant , prewar colonial style . A caste system . " " Did you see SS ? " " Yes . " " Gestapo ? " " Who can say ? " " And it was peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have resettled Jews in Russia , Algeria , Madagascar , even Finland , but there was a lot of debate on the question . Most of the peace parties back in the States were willing to believe it and back off , while the Warhawk Democrats claimed it was all eyewash . I did n't know what to think . My job was to watch their ships and go where the Navy sent us . If it came to it , I 'd sink them , or they 'd sink me . From what I knew of their new Type XXV boats , I would n't give our TENCH class much of an edge , but no one was paying me to live forever . Broussart pointed across the patio . " Is he for you ? " Ensign Crockett , our lanky young Gunnery Officer , was snaking between the tables , heading our way . He saluted . " Sir , we have a four-hour recall to sail , but you 're to report to the squadron commander on the double . " " Me ? " Crockett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skipper . " I heard the noon gun from the harbor battery just as I tapped on Captain Carpenter 's door . " Come . " I saluted . " At ease , Andrews . " He waved me to a chair . " You heard about Commander Picerni ? " " Yessir . Just now . A heart attack ? " Carpenter scratched his bluish stubble . " I guess it got past the physical . He 's out of submarines now and I do n't have a replacement - so you 're it , Lieutenant . " He handed me a manila folder . " Look at these . " I did . They were line drawings of what appeared at first to be a rather pedestrian-looking ocean liner . The legend named it the Peter Strasser . " What is she , sir ? " " Intelligence says it 's a repatriation transport and they 're not sure what that means , but there 's at least one of them in the Indian Ocean . It could be a supply ship , a U-boat mother ship , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to find it and find out . " How , I thought ? Ask to go aboard for a tour ? But I replied , " Aye , aye , sir . Just Unicorn ? . " " Roncador will run from south of Rodrigues to the Mozambique Channel . Guavina will cover a line from here to the Persian Gulf . They 'll be patrolling with orders to watch for the Strasser but they are mostly cover . You will take Unicorn up the east coast of Madagascar to Socotra and then run box patrols in the Gulf of Aden . " I studied the large map on the wall , marked with colliding jurisdictions and intersecting arcs . " Sir , we 'll be well within the Aden patrol circle . " " Yes . " " I understand that the krauts are pretty touchy about anyone getting close to the Red Sea . Suez .... " Carpenter regarded me with a long , silent question , probably trying to decide whether he 'd made a mistake , if he should give the job to someone else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts . " You 're wondering why I did n't pick a more senior man for this job . Someone with more experience of command . " I nodded , trying to look as if I fully understood , because the only ship I 'd ever commanded was a training sub in Puget Sound and Carpenter knew it . " Relax , Lieutenant . " I tried , suddenly conscious of the background sounds of Mauritius . Seabirds called over the anchorage , the ceiling fans whirred and thumped , and the breeze brought the faint sound of native music . Carpenter leaned forward . It was not a gesture of conspiracy or comradeship . He did it to take a kink out of his back , injured last year when his sub had hit a mine off Honshu . " You 'll get a set of orders for a routine patrol . You 'll exceed those orders in the manner I 've described . An older , more seasoned officer would n't do that ; at least not the captains under my command . It would n't be plausible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't risk their careers or their ships . " You 'll find the Strasser , find out what you can about her , then come home . " " And if we 're attacked ? " " You may take any measures you deem appropriate to defend yourselves , but try not to restart the war . " WE WERE QUITE HAPPY to sail in a ship called the Unicorn , though initially few of us were aware of the symbolism . Like all American submarines , Unicorn was named for a fish , another name for Monodon monoceros , the narwhal . Up until modern times , horns of the seagoing unicorn often turned up in antiquarian hordes and were thought to be from the hoofed unicorns , the mythical horse variety , a creature that never existed except in folklore . It was Greiner who told us what unicorns signified . Moe Greiner was our Radioman 's Mate , our RM2 . He had a Masters in European history with a minor in English Literature . He spoke at least four languages ( English , German , Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along in French , Italian , and Hebrew . He was our all-purpose intellectual and well respected , the moreso that he hailed from Brooklyn and had once played shortstop for a Dodgers farm club . " They 're a symbol of purity , " Moe had told us early in our commission . " They may only be approached by the purest of maidens . " He smiled . " Which means the sort of women of which none of you are familiar . " There was a ripple of laughter . " I hope not , " someone muttered . " They are also a symbol of purity of purpose , of the essential innocence of decency , of the quest for the right , of honor - " " Right up there with the Holy Grail , " Chief Perry said . Like Moe , our Chief Engineer was a reader . " All of the Arthurian stuff . " Moe nodded . " The roots are in chivalry , at a time when people , some people , believed in the idea of a just war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fought cleanly with rules . Some journalist had dubbed it " the American way of war - fought hard and relentlessly , yet with kindness and decency to the defeated foe . " That was before Kyushu and Honshu , where they just kept killing us , whatever the toll in blood . Where they refused to give up until we were napalming anything that moved . MacArthur 's draconian methods had finally ended the Japanese resistance but at such a cost that the survivors would hate us for a thousand years . As Unicorn worked her way north through the Seychelles , running surfaced at night , our lookouts and Sugar William radar kept us on edge , ready to dive at any provocation . I tried to relax into the mission but it was my first command ; the greatest responsibility I could carry for a ship and the lives of eighty men , and I could never fully rest . I haunted the bridge , the conn , the wardroom , saying little and probably driving the crew crazy , though no one mentioned it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandable since I had their lives in my hands . Old lives , of old , young men . There 's something about trying to establish routine in the Valley of the Shadow of Death that darkens men 's souls and makes them old before their time . It was more or less routine , as we worked our way northward . During the day we ran submerged , avoiding known minefields and taking periscope photos of every island , port , and ship we encountered . At night we made better time on the surface , recharging our batteries . We saw a few freighters , a German destroyer , fishing boats , and aircraft , though the Kriegsmarine had not yet developed much of a night ASW capability . As we had a trained and seasoned crew , I primarily supervised the ship 's routine , filled out the log pages , and played chess with our supercargo . Andre Broussart had been just as surprised as I , not that he 'd admitted it . He 'd arrived on the dock clad in British submarine kit and carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , " gave away any later attempt to convince me that he had known about this ( and every other movement in the Indian Ocean ) all along . " Yes , " I chuckled . " After all , you 're part American . " He just scowled . After ten days I was beating him evenly at chess and we were both beginning to believe that the hunt for the Peter Strasser was a wild goose chase . Broussart was along ostensibly as liaison , but he quickly confided in me that his family business back in France had been concerned with shipyards . " Freighters , coasters , fishing boats , " he said one evening as we pored over the drawing of the Strasser . " Not little ones ; the big South Atlantic whalers . Our yard built the Jacques Cartier . " " Which is ... ? " " Was , " he grumped . " A giant whale factory ship . She was sunk off South Georgia in " 42 . What do you make of this ? " " This " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strasser , each row bordered by rectangular lines . The rows were of identical size and ran three-quarters of the ship 's length . There was no reason to have them . " Decoration ? " I asked . " I doubt it , " Andre replied . " Windows like this are n't practical . On a ship in wartime - " " Not windows then , but a gallery framing some sort of promenade deck . Where did this drawing originate ? " Andre shrugged and puffed , his cigarette smoke leaving a blue mist in the air of my cabin . " Some agent with an artistic bent in Aden or Suez . It 's a very good line drawing but it is not a blueprint . It says that the thing is five hundred and fifty feet long . " " Big . But why build this in wartime ? Germany and Italy have liners , theirs and yours , Dutch , Swedish . This is new . " " These galleries could hide guns . " I shook my head . " No one would build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many warships and aircraft and not enough neutral flags left to hide behind . " " Missiles ? Aircraft ? Mines ? " " There 's no point , " I said firmly . " They 're either something else or nothing at all . " And so they remained as we ran north . Then we found him . We were two days south of Socotra . That night we 'd avoided an Italian squadron comprising a Lifforio-class battleship , two cruisers , and four destroyers , sailing around in that corner of the Indian Ocean that the Germans had let them keep . As we surfaced in their wake , the night moonless but spread brightly with equatorial stars , we almost ran over him . Seaman Bone , our best lookout , spotted him before anyone . " Object on the port bow , Sir . " Through the glasses it looked at first like a log . " Skipper , " said Tompkinson , our First Lieutenant , " I think there 's a man on that thing . " " All stop . Pick him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below to Doc Gordon . Broussart and I waited in the passageway until the Doc came out . " How is he , Leo ? " Leo Gordon spread his broad flat hands and passed me the clipboard . " Better than he has any right to be . These are shark waters and my guess is he 's been on that log for days . And , I think he 's a Jew . " " That would explain why he 'd risk the sharks , " Broussart said . " Better company than the Boche , for a Jew . " " His clothes are European . Shabby . No identification but a number tattooed on his arm . " " He say anything ? " " Yeah , but I ca n't make it out , " Gordon said . " It sounds German . " " Get Greiner . " We waited while Moe went in to talk to the man , who appeared debilitated but calm , lying flat on his back , blinking at the bright lights of our makeshift dispensary . After a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language you heard was Polish , " he said , rubbing his bearded chin , a prognathous jaw that went well with his blocky frame . " I do n't speaka da Polack , but he also speaks Yiddish , which I do know . His name is Hershel Dubrovski , he 's starving , exhausted , and I think something really horrible happened to him . " Broussart snorted . " Of course it did . He 's a Jew . " Two days later we lay on the ocean floor off Cape Ras Aser and heard a recovering though still weak Hershel Dubrovski tell his story . There were three of us ; Broussart , Greiner , and I. Greiner also ran the wire recorder . What follows is an edited transcript of Hershel Dubrovski 's story as translated by RM2 Moe Greiner : " I grew up in southern Poland and was in Krakow when the war began . I knew that I should have left ; run , run anywhere , but I was part of a large family . There were parents , grandparents , aunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cousins in great profusion . Four generations . As far as I know , I am the only survivor . " We were scattered to the winds . Before the war I had been a hydraulic engineer for the city government of Krakow , but the Nazis made me a farm laborer and sent me first to East Prussia and later to the Ukraine . " After the Fall of France , and then the British Isles , the Germans turned on Russia . We heard about Turkey and the British having to give up Africa . We worked and we died , but as long as we grew crops they did not often kill us . " Always we heard of resettlement . In the north , east in Siberia , in Africa and Madagascar . Special ships were being built . There would be subservient Jewish states but we would be allowed to live . Then , last winter , we were told that our farms were going to be resettled with ethnic Germans . We were to make ready to go to Madagascar . Germans from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : about the forests , the animals , the climate , the work we would have . They explained that we would be autonomous . We would have our own culture and , so long as we remained peaceful and productive , we would be protected . Some of us believed all of it , some believed none of it . Most of us expected some amount of sorrow , perhaps with a silver lining . We Jews have made our way for centuries . We survived Babylon and Rome . We would survive the Nazis . " Ten , maybe twelve weeks ago we were marched to the trains . As always , they sealed us in freight cars but the ride was short . A day and a night brought us to Sevastopol , which the Germans have made into a resort . We were allowed to clean up at the station and then we were marched to the docks . There were few guards . We were going to our own land . We were happy . Besides , there was nowhere to run . " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new as these things go . Ours was named the Gorch Fock and she looked like the picture you showed me . We were to be carried on three decks on each side , and when I saw the accommodation I was puzzled . There were fifteen hundred of us in our compartment . It was very long , with doors on each end that we were not allowed to pass through . On the inner wall there were painted murals of pastoral scenes but no doors or windows . There were tracks or grooves in the steel decking , perhaps every twenty feet apart , running from the inner wall to the outer and in the outer wall were open gallery windows where we could stand and watch the sights passing : the Black Sea , the Bosphorus , Egypt , and the Suez Canal . Most of us had never even seen the ocean before . We felt exhilarated and alive for perhaps the first time in years . " The accommodations consisted of screens and simple furniture , which we could arrange as we saw fit . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built over holes in the deck designed for that purpose . Food was delivered . It was very basic and prepared in advance , but it was plentiful . There were two SS officials , a man and a woman , assigned to answer our questions and requests and they seemed solicitous and kind . A shipboard society quickly grew up . We were required to do no work . We were on holiday . " I knew about a score of people who had come from my farm and we held long discussions about what was awaiting us . Most of us were cheerful and optimistic . I had my doubts . The ship seemed strange , and from my background as a hydraulic engineer it seemed that much of it did not make sense . I could not imagine that anyone would design a ship like this but then , the Germans had won the war . Perhaps this was based on new mechanical discoveries of which I had no knowledge . " It was after we entered the Indian Ocean that we discovered what all of this meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the east . I am not sure , but I think that those conditions had something to do with the fact that I am still alive . " I was standing at the gallery windows with my friend Moshe Morser . We were watching the sea . We knew that we were close to Madagascar and we would be there in less than a week . Moshe was a printer and looked forward to finding work in his field . The colony must have a newspaper , perhaps several . Even the Germans must need things printed . Then we smelled it . " At first we thought that the ship must be flushing its sanitary tanks , but I had worked in the farm 's butcher shop and I knew that smell for what it was . Blood and offal . They were pumping quantities of it into the sea , but for what purpose I could not guess . Until we saw the sharks . " They were drawn by the blood and came in ones and twos and tens until there were a hundred or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been happening on the other side . At that point I had a terrible feeling that I knew what must come next , though I did not know how . Then the sound began . " It was like a great dam opening its floodgates - huge motors , gigantic grinding gears , and then a terrible vibration in the deck . The night lighting went out and people began to scream . And then I saw that the inner wall was beginning to move outward , pushing everything before it : furniture , belongings and people . The wall was compressing us all toward the gallery windows . At first we thought it was a mistake and we beat on the doors but they were not opened as the wall rolled on the tracks set into the floor , squeezing fifteen hundred of us together . Then the gallery walls began to lift , opening the side of the ship , and the first people began to fall out . " We fought , we prayed , we pleaded , we tried to stop the wall with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , splashing down among the trunks and suitcases and furniture . Some hit the lifted gallery walls below us but there was no place to hang on . Some who knew that I had been an engineer begged me to find a way to stop it but of course there was nothing I could do . I beat on the walls until I , too , was pushed over . " The fact that I hit the water and nothing else , that I did n't pass out , that I was able to climb aboard a trunk and hang on is the only proof I have that God was watching . Why he saw fit to save me while nine thousand others perished that night I do not know . I do not have to tell you what I saw and heard that night and the next day and night as the sharks came and killed everyone and turned the sea red . " By the second morning it was over and I was still alive . The sharks were gone and the seabirds were finishing the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reached an uninhabited island where I remained for six weeks . Then , two days ago , a German patrol ship arrived and put a landing party ashore . I knew they were looking for people like me , so I took to the sea . I was trying to reach another island when you found me . " We left Greiner and Dubrovski conversing quietly in Yiddish . Later Greiner pulled the curtains on the Radio Room and got quickly , quietly , and illegally drunk . Instead of preferring charges , I had Chief Perry put him to bed . I attended to the changing of the watch and told Tompkinson to surface the boat an hour after sunset and set a course for Costivy Island in the Seychelles . Then I went to my cabin and began to study the charts . It was reasonably easy , if you knew the winds and ocean currents , to backtrack Dubrovski to his island . And from there I could estimate where the Goich Pock had dumped its human cargo . The German Racial planners were clever . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drops for nights when wind and weather conditions were right . They could hold a ship at Aden until a storm had passed and thus insure that their disposal system worked perfectly . And they were methodical . They would return to the same spot again and again with hundreds of thousands of victims until such time as the sea would give up her dead in the light of the world to come . Leave it to them to design such a solution . There was a tap on the door . Broussart looked pale and I could tell that he , too , had been drinking . We had done our best to keep the crew from finding out about Dubrovski 's story , but submarines are like small towns , and the word had passed swiftly . The men were , by degrees , depressed , fearful , or quietly angry . War was one thing , but this " I know , " Broussart said , offering me his flask . I waved it away . " Trust the Germans to come up with something so monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these waters far longer than I had . " Andre , could that happen ? Could sharks kill so many ? Might there be other survivors ? " " I do not know , Gregory , but these Jews came from Poland , Slovakia , the Baltic States , the Ukraine . Farmers and townsmen . I 'd bet that few could swim and the ones who could were probably pulled under by those panicking around them . You would n't even need sharks , except to clean up the evidence . " Trust the Germans . My mother was second generation German , her family from the east bank of the Rhein . America was full of Germans , most of whom would be sick with fury if they knew . I could n't believe that the average German in Germany could condone this either . " Andre , how big do you think this is ? " " God help me , I do not know . Dubrovski saw three identical ships . They have been building them for the purpose . How many ? Dozens ? A hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of every port in Europe , loaded with Jews going to their new homeland , then coming back empty to pick up more while the sharks feed . And when they run out of Jews ? Blacks and Arabs perhaps . Slavs and Poles , Balkans , Baits , then finally even the French and Spanish until the entire German world is populated solely with Aryans . Tell me , Capitaine , is that possible ? " I said nothing . After a long moment I pushed the map over to him . " I think , " I said at last , " that we had better find out . " We lay quietly on the surface , in and out of drifting patches of fog , waiting . There was a full complement of lookouts and gunners topside and others lurked in the hatches , listening , waiting to know and act . The American need to achieve justice through action . These men were not war-weary . They were skilled , motivated , and dangerous , and I was in command . I knew about regulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . But how far ? Not enough , or too much , and it became the old service trap : investigation , court martial , and sentence . I stood on the bridge with Broussart , Greiner , and Herschel Dubrovski . The lookouts " binoculars were useless in the fog but above us the radar scoop was turning smoothly , probing the darkness . " You know that whatever happens we can not prevent it , " said Broussart . " I know . " " We 're here only to witness . " " Yes . " " Jew if by sea , " Greiner muttered . I looked at him . " What ? " He blinked at me but did not back away . " One if by land , Jew if by sea , " he said softly . " And I on the opposite shore will be . " " That 's enough , Greiner . " " Yessir . " The intercom buzzed . It was Tompkinson . " Skipper , we 've got a good-sized target bearing Starboard Six-Oh at eight thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at eight knots . " Greiner was nodding , his head moving in little bobs , his lips moving silently . I grabbed his arm and pushed him toward the hatch . WE CLOSED ON the target at periscope depth . She was running with lights , indicating a merchantman , but her boxy silhouette soon revealed her for what she was . As she bore down on us we ducked into a patch of fog . " Take her up , " I said quietly . " Decks awash . " With just the top half of our conning tower above the water we presented a difficult target for the German radar , but at any rate they were busy with other things . The ship came on slowly . At first the smell was faint but the damp fogs carried it to us . I looked at Dubrovski , who touched his nose and nodded . As he did , I saw the fin of a large shark sweep by us in the mist . I touched the intercom button . " Ready , Mr. Tompkinson ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship had slowed to a few knots of headway . It could n't be more than a thousand yards away . Dubrovski and I and the lookouts waited . Below , standing at the base of the ladder , Broussart was watching me through the open hatch . I glanced at Dubrovski again . His eyes were closed and his lips were moving , his head bobbing like Greiner's. he was praying . We heard it all from where we were . First the grinding mechanical sounds of the moving walls , then the cries of the people betrayed , the splashes , and finally the terrible screams from the water . The lookouts swore and Dubrovski tried to shut it out as I focused in on the ship with my glasses . " What are you doing , Capitaine " Broussart had climbed up far enough to stick his head through the hatch . I continued to watch the ship , waiting . " Exceeding my orders . " " Yes , but - " Then I saw it . The gallery walls were closing . The murderers were finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Below in the water , their victims were dying . " Ready , Mr. Tompkinson ? " " Yessir . " " Fire Tubes One and Two . " The boat gave a lurch as the two torpedoes left their tubes , curved , and streaked toward the ship . " What have you done ? " Broussart wailed . I kept my eyes on the ship . Both fish hit amidships almost simultaneously with a terrific roar and a submerged detonation that must have killed some of those in the water . There was no cheering aboard our sub . I watched the death ship heel rapidly over , too quickly for her crew to lower the boats . They would go into the water with the Jews and take their chances with the sharks . Broussart pounded on the deck . " Do you know what you 've done ? You 've started the war all over again ! " " What makes you think it ever stopped ? " I replied . We surfaced and moved into the wreckage , distributing all of our rafts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marksmen did their best to keep the sharks away but when we left a half hour later they were still running wild among the screaming survivors . There was nothing more that we could do . We could not stay on the surface and we could not submerge with people on deck , so we sailed for the island that Dubrovski had reached and just before dawn we landed over three hundred survivors . Dubrovski went with them , to show them the way , to try to give them a fighting chance . Some of our rifles and pistols went with them . It was n't much , but it was something . Twelve women and children we kept aboard to take back to Mauritius . Later that day , as we were heading due east away from the sinking , Greiner came by my cabin . " Sir ? " " Come in , " I said . " Coffee ? " " No thank you , sir . There 's a lot of German radio traffic . It seems they 've got a ship missing . No details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio signal off . High Command does n't know it was torpedoed . " " They will soon enough , " I said . " Anything else ?
