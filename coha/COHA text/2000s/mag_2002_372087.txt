Families of those who died in the Sept. 11 tragedy say the vitriol directed at them when they talk about money feels like " a double victimization . " Anthony Gardner , who lost a brother in the World Trade Center attacks , says he has received half a dozen e-mails calling him " greedy " and " a scumbag " for criticizing the proposed formulas for victim compensation . " One woman was so vulgar , I 'm thinking about reporting her to AOL or something , " he says . <P> That 's partly why he and other World Trade Center families sought comfort last week from those who lost loved ones in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing . In the first of a series of videoconferences hooking up victims ' families  --  one group in New York , the other in Oklahoma  --  a pained Gardner asked , " Did any of you experience anything similar ? " Images on the screen showed the Midwesterners look at each other and shrug . <P> In Oklahoma City there was no such venom because money never became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media rushed to cover Johnnie Cochran 's unsuccessful lawsuit against a fertilizer manufacturer , and victims and relatives put in a bid to sue federal agencies should evidence emerge that they had forewarning of the bombing . But the Oklahoma state victim-compensation program paid only for expenses such as medical and burial costs , with a limit of $10,000 per victim . The feds issued $1.4 million in emergency grants and in 1997 gave victims and relatives a little travel money to attend Timothy McVeigh 's trial in Denver . <P> Which helps explains why some Oklahomans now feel like second-class victims . " It 's not personal , " says Marsha Kight , whose daughter perished in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building . " The Sept. 11 compensation fund is creating inequitable differences between us and them . Should there really be a hierarchy ? " <P> One leveling force is the passage of time , and that , in a way , was the message the Oklahomans had for the New Yorkers . " In the days after a disaster , everybody wants to help , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People tend to say , ' O.K. , that 's enough . Drop it . ' " Which is why any feelings of rivalry during the session were trumped by a desire to soothe . The people who begrudge the money ? " They are definitely in the minority , " said Oklahoma widow Diane Leonard . <P>  --  By Julie Rawe
