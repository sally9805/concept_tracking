Once imprisoned by Pinochet , the new Socialist president Michelle Bachelet wants to spread the wealth initiated by the dictator 's wrenching economic policies <p> Jonathan , a New York Times correspondent in Chile during the 1970s , writes about economics and culture . <p> IN THE EVENING of March 12 , a broadly smiling woman emerged on the balcony of La Moneda , Chile 's presidential palace in the heart of Santiago , the capital . Inaugurated the day before as the first woman to be elected chief of state in that country , President Michelle Bachelet extended her arms , acknowledging the cheers of 200,000 compatriots in the broad square below . Chileans had gathered from communities all along this string bean of a country that stretches 2,600 miles from northern deserts through fertile central valleys to rain-drenched southern forests . <p> Bachelet , a 55-year-old Socialist , offered her audience a message of pain and redemption , drawn from her own personal experience . She recalled the numerous victims of the 17-year , rightwing dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet that ended in 1990 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us tonight ? " she asked , referring to the estimated 3,500 dead and " disappeared "  --  citizens taken from their homes , often in the dark of night , who were never heard from again . They included her own father , Alberto Bachelet , a left-wing air force general who was almost certainly tortured to death in prison after the 1973 coup that brought Pinochet to power . Bachelet , a 21-year-old student activist at the time , was also jailed and , she has said , blindfolded and beaten . " We are leaving that dramatically divided Chile behind , " the president promised that March evening . " Today ; Chile is already a new place . " <p> So it would seem . Pinochet , now 90 years old and ailing in his suburban Santiago home at the foot of the snow-topped Andes , has become an object of scorn . His political measures are well documented : the several thousand Chileans killed and many thousands more jailed for having supported the freely elected government of President Salvador Allende , a Socialist who died during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 years ago in September <p> Even most of the former dictator 's admirers abandoned him after revelations since 2004 that he accumulated at least $27 million in secret bank accounts abroad , despite a modest military salary . Pinochet has evaded prison only because strokes and heart disease have left him too impaired to stand trial . " He has been so thoroughly discredited and humiliated that whether or not he ends up behind bars in a striped suit is almost immaterial , " says Jos Zalaquett , 64 , Chile 's leading human rights lawyer . <p> And yet , Pinochet 's despotic but economically successful legacy remains troublingly ambiguous to many Chileans . Led by young , free-market policy makers , Pinochet privatized everything from mines to factories to social security . He welcomed foreign investment and lifted trade barriers , forcing Chilean businesses to compete with imports or close down . The reforms were wrenching . At one time , a third of the labor force was unemployed . But since the mid-1980s , the economy has averaged almost 6 percent annual growth , raising per capita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  making them among the most prosperous people in South America  --  and creating a thriving middle class . Today ; only 18.7 percent of the population lives below the poverty line , compared , for example , with 38.7 percent in Brazil and 62.4 percent in Bolivia . At this pace , Chile , within a generation , will become Latin America 's most prosperous nation . <p> Neighboring countries , many of which embrace populist , left-wing economic policies , tend to resent Chile 's growing prosperity , rooted as it is in the policies put in place by the region 's most notorious dictator . " We ca n't go around rubbing our neo-capitalism in the faces of other Latin Americans , " says Raul Sohr , a Chilean novelist and leading center-left political commentator " Bachelet certainly wo n't do that . " <p> At home , however , neo-capitalism has taken root . The democratically elected governments that have succeeded Pinochet in Chile have barely tinkered with the economic model he ushered in . " Voters figure that the same economic policies will continue no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Castro , 76 , who forged many of the Pinochet-era reforms . " So , if the left wants to appropriate the model we created , well that 's just fine . " <p> But traveling across this irresistibly beautiful country , it is hard not to notice the tension between economic consensus and brutal recent history , the origins of which I observed firsthand as a Santiago-based foreign correspondent for the New York Times at the end of the Allende government and in the early Pinochet regime . <p> MY MOST RECENT TRIP begins with a visit to a rodeo in Coronel , an agrarian community some 330 miles south of the capital . During the Allende years , militant peasant groups took over many farms and ranches , especially around Coronel . Conservative landowners here still display strong loyalties to Pinochet because he crushed the militants and returned their properties to them . <p> Thirty years ago , I reported on the peasant takeovers here . Today , I return to find the landscape transformed . Roads have been broadened and paved . Scruffy corn and wheat farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berries , broccoli and fava beans . The highway to the Pacific Ocean port of Concepcin , 14 miles north , is lined with factories where huge harvests of produce are frozen and packaged for export to the United States and other Northern Hemisphere markets . <p> The reasons for the agrarian boom are obvious to its beneficiaries , some of whom I meet at the Coronel rodeo . Pinochet 's free-market regime offered farmers a crucial choice : fight a losing battle against cheaper grain imports from Argentina or develop products for export . A critical mass of farmers wisely  --  and ultimately successfully  --  chose the export route . " Pinochet saved us , " says Marina Aravena , sitting in the rodeo stands next to her father , an elderly rancher and agribusiness owner . Bachelet 's inauguration would take place during the rodeo weekend , but Aravena , like many of the 2,000 spectators , had no intention of watching the ceremony on television . " I 'm not the least interested , " she says . <p> AT NIGHT , ranchers and spouses gather to celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground 's makeshift banquet hall , a palm-thatched space with sawdust spread over the floor . Couples shuffle through the cueca , a popular dance that reminds me of a rooster trying to corner a hen . In a fast-changing , increasingly urbanized society , many Chileans seem eager to embrace huaso culture  --  with its emphasis on military bearing ; mocking songs ; and a hardy cuisine reliant on empanadas ( meat-filled turnovers ) and cazuela de carne ( thick beef stew poured over rice ) . <p> The distinctive huaso culture grew out of geographical constraints . Because the country is so narrow  --  never wider than 120 miles from the Andes in the east to the Pacific in the west  --  ranches were always much smaller than in nearby Argentina , with its vast plains . Grazing lands in Chile were n't fenced off , so herds from neighboring ranches mingled and were separated only after they had fattened enough for slaughter . The most efficient way to cull animals was to lead them singly into corrals , each enclosure belonging to a different rancher . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wanted to risk injuring a neighbor 's cattle . <p> Tonight , at the long , wooden bar , boisterous huasos are sampling local cabernets and merlots . An argument ensues about a proposal to allow women to compete in future rodeos . " Anything can happen , " says Rafael Bustillos , a 42- year-old huaso , with a shrug . " None of us could have imagined a woman president . " <p> Bachelet would no doubt agree . " A few years ago , frankly ; this would have been unthinkable , " she told the Argentine congress on her first visit abroad , just ten days after assuming office . Discriminatory attitudes toward women , which had hardened during Pinochet 's military dictatorship , lingered well after the restoration of democracy ( Divorce was n't legalized until 2004 ; Chile was the last country in the Americas to do so . ) Yet Bachelet is a single parent of three children . <p> She grew up the daughter of a career air force officer , moving around Chile as her father was posted from one base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic chaos and nearing civil strife , President Allende appointed General Bachelet to enforce price controls on food products and ensure their distribution to poorer Chileans . " It would cost him his life , " his daughter would recall in Michelle , a biography by Elizabeth Subercaseaux and Maly Sierra , recently published in Chile . General Bachelet 's zeal for the task got him labeled an Allende sympathizer ; he was arrested hours after the Pinochet-led coup that began on September 11 , 1973 , with the bombing of La Moneda . Michelle Bachelet watched the attack from the roof of her university and saw the presidential palace in flames . Six months later , her father died in prison , officially from a heart attack . <p> After her own brief imprisonment ( no official charges were filed against her ) , Michelle Bachelet was deported to Australia , in 1975 , but after a few months there she moved to East Berlin , where she enrolled in medical school . She married another Chilean exile , Jorge Dvalos , an architect who is the father of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her personal life with an openness unusual , especially among public figures , in this conservative Catholic country . She wed in a civil ceremony in East Germany ; she told her biographers , only after she became pregnant . She separated from her husband , she added , because " the constant arguments and fights were not the sort of life I wanted for myself or my children . " Returning to Chile four years later , in 1979 , she earned degrees in surgery and pediatrics at the University of Chile 's School of Medicine . At a Santiago hospital , she met a fellow doctor who , like Bachelet , was attending AIDS patients . The couple separated within months of the birth of their daughter , Sofia . <p> Following years of working as a doctor and administrator at public health agencies , Bachelet was named Minister of Health in 2000 by President Ricardo Lagos , a Socialist for whom she had campaigned . As a member of his cabinet , Bachelet quickly delivered on her public promise to end long waiting lines at government clinics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 to be his Minister of Defense , the first woman to occupy that post and a controversial appointment , considering her father 's fate . " I 'm not an angel , " she told the New York Times that year . " I have n't forgotten . It left pain . But I have tried to channel that pain into a constructive realm . I insist on the idea that what we lived through here in Chile was so painful , so terrible , that I would n't wish for anyone to live through our situation again . " By most accounts , the daughter proved popular among army officers for working hard to dissolve lingering distrust between the armed forces and center-left politicians . In 2003 , on her watch , army commander in chief Gen. Juan Emilio Cheyre publicly vowed that the military would " never again " carry out a coup or interfere in politics . <p> Bachelet won the presidency in a runoff on January 15 , 2006 , with 53.5 percent of the vote against conservative Sebastiin Piera , a billionaire businessman . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Karen Poniachik , 40 , as minister of mining and energy . " When I visit my supermarket , women clerks and customers  --  even some who admit not having voted for Bachelet  --  tell me how good they feel about seeing women at the top levels of government , " says Poniachik , a former journalist . But many others , particularly in the business world , where a bias against women is widespread , sound uneasy <p> Mine owners , in particular , have distrusted Socialists since the Allende years . Calling copper " the wages of Chile , " Allende nationalized the biggest mines , which happened to be owned by U.S. companies . That action provoked the ire of Washington , and soon the Central Intelligence Agency was abetting plotters against Allende . The Marxist president had failed to gain the support of most copper miners , who considered themselves the country 's blue-collar elite . Angered by hyperinflation that undercut their paychecks , many joined general strikes  --  in part financed by the CIA  --  that weakened Allende and set the stage for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to private investors , both foreign and Chilean . Low taxes and minimal interference let mine owners raise technology levels , improve labor conditions and vastly increase production . And the center-left civilian governments that followed Pinochet have pursued the same policies . Several South American countries , including Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador , are increasing state control of natural resources . " But in Chile , it 's not even an issue , " says Poniachik . " Everybody thinks private investment has been positive in all aspects of mining . " <p> Most of Chile 's copper mines are in the dry and cloudless desert north . One of the biggest , Los Pelambres , some 125 miles north of Santiago , is largely owned by the family of Andrnico Luksic , who died last year at 78 . As a young man , Luksic sold his stake in a small ore deposit he had discovered to investors from Japan . The Japanese thought the price Luksic had quoted them was in dollars when in fact it was in Chilean pesos . As a result , Luksic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times his asking price . This marked the beginning of his stupendous fortune . Last year , Los Pelambres earned $1.5 billion , thanks to record copper prices stoked by booming Asian economies . " Prices will stay high for at least the next three years , " says Luis Novoa , a financial executive at Los Pelambres . " China and India just keep growing and need all the copper we can sell them . " <p> At the upper edge of Los Pelambres , 11,500 feet high , the air is so thin and clear that the ridges from exhausted copper veins appear closer than they are , as do mammoth mechanized shovels scooping up new ore deposits at the bottom of the canyon-size pit . " All these deposits were once liquid magma  --  molten rock deep below the surface-and could have spewed out of volcanoes , like what happened all over Chile , " says Alvio Zuccone , the mine 's chief geologist . " But instead the magma cooled and hardened into mineral deposits . " <p> The deposits contain less than 1 percent copper ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved into a water emulsion that is piped to a Pacific port about 65 miles west . There the emulsion is dried into a cake ( now 4o percent copper ) and shipped , mostly to Asia . The Los Pelambres work is the simplest part of the process . " We 're just a bunch of rock grinders , " says Zuccone . <p> Because mining takes place in the almost unpopulated northern deserts , it has escaped environmental controversy : But forestry has stirred heated debate . " Under the volcanoes , beside the snow-capped mountains , among the huge lakes , the fragrant , the silent , the tangled Chilean forest , " wrote Pablo Neruda ( 1904-73 ) , Chile 's Nobel laureate poet , about his childhood in the country 's wooded south . Today ; little of his beloved forest survives . Gone are the bird that " sings like an oboe , " and the scents of wild herbs that " flood my whole being , " as Neruda recalled . Like yellow capillaries , timber access roads and bald patches scar the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used some of the proceeds from the sale of his majority stake in the sportswear firm Esprit to create a refuge for Chile 's shrinking , ancient forests at Pumaln , a private park encompassing 738,000 acres of virgin woodlands some 800 miles south of Santiago . Initially , Pumaln was hugely controversial . Ultranationalists claimed that because it amounted to a foreign-owned preserve that bisected the country ; it threatened Chile 's security . But opposition dissolved once it became clear that Tompkins ' intentions were benign . Several Chilean billionaires have followed his example and bought vast forest expanses to preserve as parks . ( In Argentina , however , where Tompkins created a 741,000-acre preserve , opposition to foreign ownership of environmental refuges has intensified . Critics there are calling for Tompkins to divest  --  despite his stated intention to donate holdings to the government . ) <p> Pumaln is also important because it is one of the few temperate rain forests in the world . Annual rainfall here totals a startling 20 feet . As in tropical jungles , the majority of trees never lose their foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet tall . Stands of woolly bamboo rise much higher . And other plant species scale tree branches , seeking out the sun . " You see the same interdependence of species and fragility of soils that exist in the Amazon , " says a guide , Mauricio Igor , 39 , a descendant of the Mapuche Indians who thrived in these forests before the European conquest . <p> Alerce trees grow as tall as sequoias and live as long . Their seeds take a half century to germinate , and the trees grow only an inch or two a year . But their wood , which is extremely hard , has long been prized in house construction , and despite decades of official prohibitions against its use , poachers have brought the species to the verge of extinction . Pumaln is part of the last redoubt of the alerce  --  750,000 acres of contiguous forest stretching down from the Andes on the Argentine border to the Chilean fiords on the Pacific . <p> In a cathedral stand of alerces , Igor points out one with a 20-foot circumference , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . Its roots are entwined with those of a half-dozen other species . Its trunk is draped in red flowers . " I doubt even this tree would have survived if Pumaln did n't exist , " he says . <p> MEXICO CITY AND LIMA built imposing Baroque-style palaces and churches with the silver bonanzas mined in Mexico and Peru during the 1600s and 1700s . But the oldest structures in Santiago date back only to the 19th century . " Chile was on the margins of the Spanish Empire , and its austere architecture reflected its modest economic circumstances , " says Antonio Sahady , director of the Institute of Architectural Restoration at the University of Chile , which has helped preserve older Santiago neighborhoods . <p> Now Santiago 's more affluent citizens are moving eastward into newer districts closer to the Andes . " They have embraced the California model of the suburban house with a garden and a close view of the mountains  --  and of course , the shopping mall , " says Sahady I drop by a mirrored high-rise where one of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Castro , Pinochet 's former economics minister and architect of his reforms , is chairman of the company . <p> De Castro was the leader of " the Chicago boys , " a score of Chileans who studied economics at the University of Chicago in the 1950s and ' 60s and became enamored with the free-market ideology of Milton Friedman , a Nobel laureate then teaching at the school . Once installed in the highest reaches of the Pinochet regime , the Chicago boys put into practice neo-capitalist notions beyond anything Friedman was advocating . <p> " Maybe the most radical of these ideas was to privatize the social security system , " says de Castro . To be sure , by the time the Allende government was overthrown in 1973 , payments to retirees had become virtually worthless because of hyperinflation . But nowhere in the world had private pension funds replaced a state-run social security system . Under the system put in place in 1981 , employees hand over 12.5 percent of their monthly salaries to the fund management company of their choice . The company invests the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments guarantee " a dignified retirement "  --  as the system 's slogan asserts  --  after a quarter-century of contributions . President Bush , who visited Chile in November 2004 , praised the country 's privatized pension system and suggested it could offer guidance for the Social Security overhaul that he was then advocating at home . <p> The positive effects on the Chilean economy became apparent much sooner . As pension fund contributions mushroomed into billions of dollars , Chile created the only domestic capital market in Latin America . Rather than having to depend on high-interest loans from global banks , Chilean firms could raise money by selling their stocks and bonds to private pension fund management companies . " This was a crucial element in our economic growth , " says de Castro . <p> " I thought , ' This is the place , ' " American philanthropist Douglas Tompkins ( at his refuge ) , told the Los Angeles Times about his first glimpse of Chile 's remote Pumaln wilderness , in 1990 . Government emissaries from elsewhere in Latin America and as far away as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and install versions in their own countries . <p> But seven years ago Yazmir Fariia , an accountant at the University of Chile , began to notice something amiss . Retired university professors , administrators and blue-collar employees were complaining that they were receiving much less than they expected , while the small minority who stayed with the old , maligned , state-run social security system were doing quite well . " We began doing research across the country , just among public employees , " says Faria , 53 . " More than 12,000 retirees immediately sent us complaints that they were making a fraction of what they had been promised . We discovered a nationwide catastrophe . " According to spokespersons for the private pension funds , only those retirees who failed to make regular contributions are suffering a shortfall in their retirement checks . But this is disputed by many retirees . <p> Graciela Ortz , 65 , a retired government lawyer , gets a pension of $600 a month  --  less than a third of what she expected . Her friend , Maria Bustos , 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue service , fives on $5o0 a month . And Abraham Balda , 66 , a night guard at the university for 35 years , subsists on a monthly pension of $170 . " The private pension funds are helping the country grow , " says Faria , who formed an association of retirees to lobby for lost benefits and pension reform . " But whatever happened to a ' dignified retirement ' ? " <p> Faria 's association has ballooned to 120,000 members . More important , their complaints became the biggest issue of the recent presidential campaign . The retirees probably gave Bachelet a decisive edge in her victory On that March 12 evening following her inauguration , the new president made a long list of promises to the many thousands of spectators gathered below the balcony of the presidential palace . Their loudest cheers erupted when she promised to fix the private pension system . " What could be better than finishing off in 2010 with a great social protection system for all citizens ? " she asked . And what could be better than a major economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ? <p> MAP : SOUTH AMERICA <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Michelle Bachelet ( in Santiago this past January , opposite ) became Chile 's first female president on March 11 .
