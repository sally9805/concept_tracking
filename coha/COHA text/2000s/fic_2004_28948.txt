1 My knees were scrunched to my chest , palms sweaty , stomach churning , heart pounding . Panic attack . It happened every time something I wrote was about to be performed . It was happening now . It had been five years since my epiphany during The Crucible . That night , I 'd fallen in love with plays the way some girls fall in love with horses or dolphins . If I could have moved a cot into the back of a theater and lived there , I would have been perfectly happy . After I declared my goal in life , my mother immediately enrolled me in a junior writing workshop at the Public Theater . Then , to nurture my nascent muse , my parents took me to a play almost every single weekend . Since they believed that anything shocking I might see onstage could act as a catalyst for discussion about societal values in general , and our family 's values in particular , we went to everything . The first time I actually saw a completely naked man was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater in TriBeCa . I also read every play I could get my hands on -- Shakespeare , Chekhov , Lillian Hellman , August Wilson , and so many more . I 'd lie in bed at night , trying to peel back layers of meaning , only to find new layers . I 'd wonder if I 'd ever be able to write like they did , with lives fully explored in the world of the play itself . Now , in the Public Theater 's high school playwrights ' lab , I sat in the back row of the same space where I 'd seen The Crucible and tried not to hyperventilate . My friend BB slid into the seat next to me . BB -- short for Byron Bruin -- lived in Harlem and went to Bronx Science . His mom was a jazz composer born in Suriname , and his father was aSwedish diplomat . In the looks department , BB got the best of both worlds . " Deep breaths , " BB instructed , taking in the sweat on my forehead . He 'd seen me in this state too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I managed . He reached into his backpack . " I know just what you need . " " I do n't do drugs . " " Ow ! " A sharp pain throbbed in my upper arm . " What the --  " BB held up the metal ruler he 'd just thwacked against my bicep . " Jerk ! " I smacked his arm . " That hurt . " He smiled smugly . " But notice you 're breathing almost normally . The actual pain-transmission neurons in your arm override the psychosomatic symptoms of panic , " he explained . " I 'm running trials for a p-chem lab . " That was just so Bronx Science . Finally , the actors took their places ; the house lights dimmed and the audience hushed . As BB gave my hand an encouraging squeeze , the stage manager read the title of my piece . PLAYED - a short play by Kate Pride - At rise : The ladies ' room at a hipper-than-thou club . KIM and DAWN , both sixteen , run in , breathless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trappings of beauty without achieving it . KIM Oh my G -- DAWN I saw him and I 'm like , whoa -- KIM He never brought me here . He said the cover was too high . And he brings her . Was I okay ? DAWN Totally . You were all like , ( blase ) Oh , hi , Kevin .

They crack up and fist-bump each other , then check themselves out in the mirror and methodically pull out an arsenal of beauty products . They primp throughout the scene , often speaking to each other 's reflections . Kim checks out her rear view . KIM Okay , I am a total cow . You could snort lines off my ass . DAWN Shut up ! You are so hot . KIM Hotter than --  ? DAWN Totally ! Did you check out those thighs ? Every time she takes a step , they like , suffocate each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Chia Pet ?

KIM Really ? DAWN Seriously mattress tested . KIM Well , Kevin and I never -- you know -- so if that 's what he wants , then whatever . Because I am totally over -- They 're interrupted when the girl they 're dissing enters . MIA , also sixteen , is effortlessly beautiful and knows it . She joins them at the mirror , fixing her makeup . MIA ( too cool ) Oh . Hi . Having fun ? KIM Not really . This club is so played . There are like , twelve-year-olds here with fake ID . MIA Kevin and I are so into each other , we did n't notice . So , we should hang sometime . I 'll call you . KIM I 'll hold my breath . Mia scrutinizes Kim . MIA ( snarky ) Cute outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kim is humiliated . A long , awkward beat as she tries to deal . DAWN Okay , she totally rides a broom . KIM At least her ass fits on one . DAWN Kimmy . The boy was never in your league . KIM Really ? DAWN Really . They methodically throw all their cosmetics back into their purses , cross to the door , and stop . KIM Dawnie . Thanks . DAWN For what ? KIM The courtesy clueless . It 's like she 's so . . . and I 'm so -- DAWN Not . She 's not . KIM Hot , you mean . DAWN She 's not . KIM Really ? DAWN Really . Really , they both know this is a lie . And they both know they know . They share a final best-friend fist bump , take a deep breath , and laugh ostentatiously to ensure that anyone who sees them will think they 're having a fabulous time . As they exit into the club , the lights fade .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
