" Are you ready ? " says Roger as he gives me a leg up , and I laugh , because I 've never been so ready in all my life . And Harry is , too , with his red neck flexed and his ears swiveling like antennae , but never together  --  if one is forward the other is back , although sometimes they land impossibly out to the side , like a lop-eared goat 's . He stamps and snorts as I lower myself into the saddle and gather the reins , and I forgive him , this time , for not standing still while I mount because while it 's terrible manners there are extenuating circumstances and I , too , can not be still . I run the reins across the black gloves that cover my wet palms and icy fingers and look back at my father , whose face is lined and stern , and then at Roger , who smiles up at me with his face a perfect composite of tension , pride , and joy . He lays a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em hell , babe , " and I laugh again , because I have every intention of doing just that . And then Marjory is leading us to the gate  --  actually holding the reins , as though I can be trusted to take fences of almost five feet but not to steer Harry into the arena . " Watch your pace going into the combination , " she says , " and do n't let him rush you . Collect him sharply coming around the turn after the water jump , and if you get past the oxer and you 're still clear , hold him back and take it easy because you 've already got it even if you take a time fault . " I nod and look across the arena at the judges because I know that already . We can take eight faults and still tie for first , and if we get none or four we 've done it , and nobody else has a hope . Marjory is still talking and I nod impatiently and just want to start because Harry and I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're ready , we 're ready , oh , we 're ready . But I know it 's not Marjory who gets to decide so I try to remember to breathe and ignore her and suddenly it 's easy , as though I 'm in a wind tunnel and all of everything beyond Harry and me is on the outside . Then I get the signal and I think that it 's time to go  --  think it , that 's all  --  and Harry goes , walking forward so deep on the bit his nose is pressed to his chest , and as we step into the arena I can see our shadow on the ground and his tail on end like a flag . The man on the PA introduces us  --  Annemarie Zimmer on Highland Harry , with a commanding lead and yadda yadda yadda  --  but no one 's paying attention because they 're staring at Harry . No gasps or murmurs this time , not on day three , but then someone goes and wrecks it because I hear some bastard man say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I know from that one remark that he 's missed days one and two and I hate him because I know he feels clever for the remark . But I suppose I 'd say it too , since you do n't see many or any striped horses out there , and before Harry I never knew such a thing existed , but here he is , and there 's no denying that . Not today . Not here . I hear the whistle and press my calves against him and we 're off . Harry shoots forward like a coiled spring , so compressed his haunches feel like they 're right under me . I tighten my fingers , No , no , no Harry , not yet , I 'll let you , but not yet , and his ears prick forward , together this time , and he says , All right , and gives me a collected canter that feels like a rocking horse , so high on the up and so low on the down . And we rock around the corner and approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I say , No , and he says , Now ? And I say No , and then a stride later I can tell he 's about to ask again , but before he can I say Yes , and he 's off and I do n't have to do anything else  --  wo n't have to until we 're over and on the other side , and then I 'll just have to ask him again , and he 'll do it because he loves me and we 're one . There 's the flap-flap-flap of leather on leather , the heavy incalzando of hoofbeats , da-da-DA , da-da-DA , da-da-DA , and then a massive push , a hundred thousand compressed pounds exploding forth before  - -  Silence . As we arc over the fence , the only parts of me in contact with anything are my calves and hands and the balls of my feet although it looks like I 'm lying on him , so forward am I and curved around his neck with my face alongside where his mane would be if it were n't braided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've landed , and as soon as his front hooves make contact with the ground I 'm back in the saddle and we 're headed toward the brick wall and it 's perfect . I can tell we 're going to be clear because that 's just the way it is . We 're flying now , and it 's a wonder to me that we touch the ground at all because clearly we do n't need to over one , two , three more fences . I lose remembrance of the order of it but do n't need to remember because I feel it ... Continues ...
