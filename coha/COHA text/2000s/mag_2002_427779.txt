THE STUPID , ENDLESS , SENSELESS SACRIFICE OF TRAINING LETS US TAKE OUT OF OUR BODIES EXACTLY WHAT WE 'VE PUT IN. // It 's February , and on the edge of sleeting . My skin wants to shrink inside my bones for a little warmth as I push up gray , drizzly mountains and attempt sketchy descents on shiny , slick roads . On a day when televisions glow from every window , I feel alone and not just a little stupid . Is it worth it ? When I get home , I stand motionless in the shower for 20 minutes , warming my fingers , toes and core . My skin burns , and once again , I silently thank the genius who invented hot water . Tomorrow comes , and I dread the ritual . Standing on the chilly linoleum floor of the bedroom , I rub Starting Oil on my legs and pull on layer upon layer . I tell myself that all I have to Too is 10 miles . If I 'm still miserable after 10 , I can go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always works . The price of proving something to yourself is the daily battle you wage against the mental naysayers that mock you . That you 're not a pro , you 're not getting paid . That you 're missing the simple pleasures in life , like drinking beer and eating chips . For me the Justification comes on race day . Friends wish me luck , and I wish they 'd all temporarily disappear . I wish I could temporarily disappear . My head and stomach swim in nauseating circles . Then there 's that moment before the gun goes off , when your field of vision closes and you feel like you 're peering through a cardboard tube . It 's during that moment that determination rises like a phoenix from the ashes of your fears . Now is the time to reap the rewards of the lonely hours on your bike when you 'd rather be hibernating . You 're scared , but also excited and ready . The race starts . As quickly as it closed , my field of vision snaps open , my legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , life is about nothing but giving everything . This is why cyclists train , race and come back again and again-because there are few opportunities in life where you truly get out what you put in , where sacrifice yields concrete results . I 've succeeded in one of life 's most important battles-overcoming the fear of trying . But dammit , I still want to win . - Selene Yeager RUFF The Turning Point YOUR BIKE WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU 'RE BETTER In times of crisis , sitting still has rarely worked for me . I decide to do things-like ride my bike around Ireland to sort out a confusing and emotionally consuming relationship . In a small village , a woman told me about Ireland 's holy wells . Said to have magical powers , the 3,000 or so wells are very hard to find unless you know what to look for  --  thorn trees or bushes covered with pieces of cloth , tied there by the devout so that the subterranean springs may take away ailments . Because I mostly cycled back roads ( and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree every week . One morning as I pushed my loaded bike across a heather-blotched waste , I saw tattered fabric hanging from thorns . On impulse , I propped my bike against a hedge and began looking for the well . I did n't have to go far . A tiny flow emerged from the ground . Unimpressed , I turned to leave . My bike was now on its side on the ground-facing the opposite direction . Spooked , my heart racing , I jumped on my bike and pedaled as fast as I could across the rough terrain . As I pedaled I started to feel refreshed and clear , going the opposite way . - Jo Ostgarden , sports and fitness writer , Portland , Oregon HAIKU last night in the dark tuna noodle casserole sort of skids along Each issue we pay homage to a beautiful poetic form by randomly excerpting three lines from letters you sent us .

Going outside would bring on a fit of itchy , burning pain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a bike , hoping she 'd become more active . She rode it a couple of times but the city traffic frightened her-riding was a nightmare . The bike sat untouched . Then , at a garage sale . Rachel discovered a granny bike-wicker basket covered with sunflowers , butterflies dangling from the saddle . She had to have it , and now she 's the proud owner of a sky-blue Fleetwing from the early ' 70s with not much going for it besides character . Now , every season has a motif . Halloween , for instance , is spider webs and a giant tarantula crawling out from the edge of the basket . Now Rachel would rather ride her granny bike with the giant chrome ding-dong bell than hitch a ride in the car . With her granny bike , she has discovered freedom and a sense of self-confidence that she never had before . I have a granny bike-a 30-year-old Raleigh Colt . complete with matching fenders and rack . A wire basket and old  --  fashioned bike horn hang from the handlebar . I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bikes like these are treasures . You ca n't find them on a rack in the local shop . and new cruisers are n't the same . You need to find yourself a bona fide , old granny bike in someone 's basement or at a garage sale-something with style and personality . if you whistle and smile when you pull it out , you know you have a 100% genuine granny bike .
