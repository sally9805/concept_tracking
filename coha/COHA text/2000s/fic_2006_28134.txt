Chapter One Party I was ninety-nine point nine percent sure I was dreaming . The reasons I was so certain were that , first , I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight-the kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks , Washington-and second , I was looking at my Grandma Marie . Gran had been dead for six years now , so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory . Gran had n't changed much ; her face looked just the same as I remembered it . The skin was soft and withered , bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath . Like a dried apricot , but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it . Our mouths-hers a wizened pucker-spread into the same surprised half-smile at just the same time . Apparently , she had n't been expecting to see me , either . I was about to ask her a question ; I had so many-What was she doing here in my dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years ? Was Pop okay , and had they found each other , wherever they were ? - but she opened her mouth when I did , so I stopped to let her go first . She paused , too , and then we both smiled at the little awkwardness . " Bella ? " It was n't Gran who called my name , and we both turned to see the addition to our small reunion . Idid n't have to look to know who it was ; this was a voice I would know anywhere-know , and respond to , whether I was awake or asleep ... or even dead , I 'd bet . The voice I 'd walk through fire for-or , less dramatically , slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for . Edward . Even though I was always thrilled to see him-conscious or otherwise-and even though I was almost positive that I was dreaming , I panicked as Edward walked toward us through the glaring sunlight . I panicked because Gran did n't know that I was in love with a vampire-nobody knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliant sunbeams were shattering off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond ? Well , Gran , you might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters . It 's just something he does in the sun . Do n't worry about it ... What was he doing ? The whole reason he lived in Forks , the rainiest place in the world , was so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family 's secret . Yet here he was , strolling gracefully toward me-with the most beautiful smile on his angel 's face-as if I were the only one here . In that second , I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent ; I usually felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he could n't hear just as clearly as if they were spoken aloud . But now I wished he could hear me , too , so that he could hear the warning I was screaming in my head . I shot a panicked glance back at Gran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just turning to stare back at me , her eyes as alarmed as mine . Edward-still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt like it was going to swell up and burst through my chest-put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother . Gran 's expression surprised me . Instead of looking horrified , she was staring at me sheepishly , as if waiting for a scolding . And she was standing in such a strange position-one arm held awkwardly away from her body , stretched out and then curled around the air . Like she had her arm around someone I could n't see , someone invisible ... Only then , as I looked at the bigger picture , did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my grandmother 's form . Uncomprehending , I raised the hand that was n't wrapped around Edward 's waist and reached out to touch her . She mimicked the movement exactly , mirrored it . But where our fingers should have met , there was nothing but cold glass ... With a dizzying jolt , my dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was me . Me in a mirror . Me-ancient , creased , and withered . Edward stood beside me , casting no reflection , excruciatingly lovely and forever seventeen . He pressed his icy , perfect lips against my wasted cheek . " Happy birthday , " he whispered . I woke with a start-my eyelids popping open wide-and gasped . Dull gray light , the familiar light of an overcast morning , took the place of the blinding sun in my dream . Just a dream , I told myself . It was only a dream . I took a deep breath , and then jumped again when my alarm went off . The little calendar in the corner of the clock 's display informed me that today was September thirteenth . Only a dream , but prophetic enough in one way , at least . Today was my birthday . I was officially eighteen years old . I 'd been dreading this day for months . All through the perfect summer-the happiest summer I had ever had , the happiest summer anyone anywhere had ever had , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleak date had lurked in ambush , waiting to spring . And now that it had hit , it was even worse than I 'd feared it would be . I could feel it-I was older . Every day I got older , but this was different , worse , quantifiable . I was eighteen . And Edward never would be . When I went to brush my teeth , I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror had n't changed . I stared at myself , looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin . The only creases were the ones on my forehead , though , and I knew that if I could manage to relax , they would disappear . I could n't . My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes . It was just a dream , I reminded myself again . Just a dream ... but also my worst nightmare . I skipped breakfast , in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible . I was n't entirely able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes acting cheerful . I honestly tried to be excited about the gifts I 'd asked him not to get me , but every time I had to smile , it felt like I might start crying . I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school . The vision of Gran-I would not think of it as me-was hard to get out of my head . I could n't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo , like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty . The dream had not done him justice . And he was waiting there for me , just the same as every other day . Despair momentarily vanished ; wonder took its place . Even after half a year with him , I still could n't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune . His sister Alice was standing by his side , waiting for me , too . Of course Edward and Alice were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Cullen and his wife , Esme , both plainly too young to have teenage children ) , but their skin was precisely the same pale shade , their eyes had the same strange golden tint , with the same deep , bruise-like shadows beneath them . Her face , like his , was also startlingly beautiful . To someone in the know-someone like me-these similarities marked them for what they were . The sight of Alice waiting there-her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement , and a small silver-wrapped square in her hands-made me frown . I 'd told Alice I did n't want anything , anything , not gifts or even attention , for my birthday . Obviously , my wishes were being ignored . I slammed the door of my ' 53 Chevy truck-a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet blacktop-and walked slowly toward where they waited . Alice skipped forward to meet me , her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair . " Happy birthday , Bella ! " " Shh ! " I hissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard her . The last thing I wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event . She ignored me . " Do you want to open your present now or later ? " she asked eagerly as we made our way to where Edward still waited . " No presents , " I protested in a mumble . She finally seemed to process my mood . " Okay ... later , then . Did you like the scrapbook your mom sent you ? And the camera from Charlie ? " I sighed . Of course she would know what my birthday presents were . Edward was n't the only member of his family with unusual skills . Alice would have " seen " what my parents were planning as soon as they 'd decided that themselves . " Yeah . They 're great . " " I think it 's a nice idea . You 're only a senior once . Might as well document the experience . " " How many times have you been a senior ? " " That 's different . " We reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . I took it eagerly , forgetting , for a moment , my glum mood . His skin was , as always , smooth , hard , and very cold . He gave my fingers a gentle squeeze . I looked into his liquid topaz eyes , and my heart gave a not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own . Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats , he smiled again . He lifted his free hand and traced one cool fingertip around the outside of my lips as he spoke . " So , as discussed , I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday , is that correct ? " " Yes . That is correct . " I could never quite mimic the flow of his perfect , formal articulation . It was something that could only be picked up in an earlier century . " Just checking . " He ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair . " You might have changed your mind . Most people seem to enjoy things like birthdays and gifts . " Alice laughed , and the sound was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll enjoy it . Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way , Bella . What 's the worst that could happen ? " She meant it as a rhetorical question . " Getting older , " I answered anyway , and my voice was not as steady as I wanted it to be . Beside me , Edward 's smile tightened into a hard line . " Eighteen is n't very old , " Alice said . " Do n't women usually wait till they 're twenty-nine to get upset over birthdays ? " " It 's older than Edward , " I mumbled . He sighed . " Technically , " she said , keeping her tone light . " Just by one little year , though . " And I supposed ... if I could be sure of the future I wanted , sure that I would get to spend forever with Edward , and Alice and the rest of the Cullens ( preferably not as a wrinkled little old lady ) ... then a year or two one direction or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward was dead set against any future that changed me . Any future that made me like him-that made me immortal , too . An impasse , he called it . I could n't really see Edward 's point , to be honest . What was so great about mortality ? Being a vampire did n't look like such a terrible thing-not the way the Cullens did it , anyway . " What time will you be at the house ? " Alice continued , changing the subject . From her expression , she was up to exactly the kind of thing I 'd been hoping to avoid . " I did n't know I had plans to be there . " " Oh , be fair , Bella ! " she complained . " You are n't going to ruin all our fun like that , are you ? " " I thought my birthday was about what I want . " " I 'll get her from Charlie 's right after school , " Edward told her , ignoring me altogether . " I have to work , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alice told me smugly . " I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it . She 's trading you shifts . She said to tell you ' Happy Birthday . ' " " I-I still ca n't come over , " I stammered , scrambling for an excuse . " I , well , I have n't watched Romeo and Juliet yet for English . " Alice snorted . " You have Romeo and Juliet memorized . " " But Mr. Berty said we needed to see it performed to fully appreciate it-that 's how Shakespeare intended it to be presented . " Edward rolled his eyes . " You 've already seen the movie , " Alice accused . " But not the nineteen-sixties version . Mr. Berty said it was the best . " Finally , Alice lost the smug smile and glared at me . " This can be easy , or this can be hard , Bella , but one way or the other- " Edward interrupted her threat . " Relax , Alice . If Bella wants to watch a movie , then she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I added . " I 'll bring her over around seven , " he continued . " That will give you more time to set up . " Alice 's laughter chimed again . " Sounds good . See you tonight , Bella ! It 'll be fun , you 'll see . " She grinned-the wide smile exposed all her perfect , glistening teeth-then pecked me on the cheek and danced off toward her first class before I could respond . " Edward , please- " I started to beg , but he pressed one cool finger to my lips . " Let 's discuss it later . We 're going to be late for class . " No one bothered to stare at us as we took our usual seats in the back of the classroom ( we had almost every class together now-it was amazing the favors Edward could get the female administrators to do for him ) . Edward and I had been together too long now to be an object of gossip any more . Even Mike Newton did n't bother to give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little guilty . He smiled now instead , and I was glad he seemed to have accepted that we could only be friends . Mike had changed over the summer-his face had lost some of the roundness , making his cheekbones more prominent , and he was wearing his pale blond hair a new way ; instead of bristly , it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual disarray . It was easy to see where his inspiration came from-but Edward 's look was n't something that could be achieved through imitation . As the day progressed , I considered ways to get out of whatever was going down at the Cullen house tonight . It would be bad enough to have to celebrate when I was in the mood to mourn . But , worse than that , this was sure to involve attention and gifts . Attention is never a good thing , as any other accident-prone klutz would agree . No one wants a spotlight when they 're likely to fall on their face . And I 'd very pointedly asked-well , ordered really-that no one give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Renee were n't the only ones who had decided to overlook that . I 'd never had much money , and that had never bothered me . Renee had raised me on a kindergarten teacher 's salary . Charlie was n't getting rich at his job , either-he was the police chief here in the tiny town of Forks . My only personal income came from the three days a week I worked at the local sporting goods store . In a town this small , I was lucky to have a job . Every penny I made went into my microscopic college fund . ( College was Plan B. I was still hoping for Plan A , but Edward was just so stubborn about leaving me human ... ) Edward had a lot of money-I did n't even want to think about how much . Money meant next to nothing to Edward or the rest of the Cullens . It was just something that accumulated when you had unlimited time on your hands and a sister who had an uncanny ability to predict trends in the stock market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him spending money on me-why it made me uncomfortable if he took me to an expensive restaurant in Seattle , why he was n't allowed to buy me a car that could reach speeds over fifty-five miles an hour , or why I would n't let him pay my college tuition ( he was ridiculously enthusiastic about Plan B ) . Edward thought I was being unnecessarily difficult . But how could I let him give me things when I had nothing to reciprocate with ? He , for some unfathomable reason , wanted to be with me . Anything he gave me on top of that just threw us more out of balance . As the day went on , neither Edward or Alice brought my birthday up again , and I began to relax a little . We sat at our usual table for lunch . A strange kind of truce existed at that table . The three of us-Edward , Alice , and I-sat on the extreme southern end of the table . Now that the " older " and somewhat scarier ( in Emmett 's case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not seem quite so intimidating , and we did not sit here alone . My other friends , Mike and Jessica ( who were in the awkward post-breakup friendship phase ) , Angela and Ben ( whose relationship had survived the summer ) , Eric , Conner , Tyler , and Lauren ( though that last one did n't really count in the friend category ) all sat at the same table , on the other side of an invisible line . That line dissolved on sunny days when Edward and Alice always skipped school , and then the conversation would swell out effortlessly to include me . Edward and Alice did n't find this minor ostracism odd or hurtful the way I would have . They barely noticed it . People always felt strangely ill at ease with the Cullens , almost afraid for some reason they could n't explain to themselves . I was a rare exception to that rule . Sometimes it bothered Edward how very comfortable I was with being close to him . He thought he was hazardous to my health-an opinion I rejected vehemently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
