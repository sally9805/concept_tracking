WOMEN OF MY YEAR The net-net for me after I read every single article in the February issue was realizing that your featured " Wonder Women " are not only focused , driven , ambitious , creative and confident achievers but also , paradoxically , " Wander Women " ( with an a ) , outlasting naysayers , adversity and cultural , gender and race restrictions  --  basically , staying on the planet long enough to either find themselves or let the world catch up with them . As I begin my own new year as a Wonder-Wander Woman hybrid , I 'll reference T &C's; cribnotes to inform my life 's work of successful womanhood ! LORIE HONOR , Staten Island , NY STILL VOTING FOR PALIN Somehow your February edition forgot to include Governor Sarah Palin as one of the " superwomen . " She has all those traits that you seemed to be seeking for the issue : smart , attractive , working mom ... ran for vice president . Guess if she does n't agree with your politics , then she does n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Novato , CA OAXACA , WOW ! It is with delight that I  --  and the many people to whom I recommended it  --  read Jaime Gross 's informative and welcoming article on Oaxaca , Mexico , in the January issue . As an aficionada of this enchanted area for more than fifty years ( I am currently president of Friends of Oaxacan Folk Art , a U.S.-based nonprofit ; fofa.us ) , I can say with authority that the author beautifully captured Oaxaca 's essential spirit and rich offerings for those creative enough to venture there : its whimsical , charming and diverse spectrum of folk arts ; its sophisticated fine arts and pre-Columbian treasures ; its outstanding cuisine and colonial architecture ; and its natural beauty , to name a few . Gross 's article also provided a much-needed correction to the greatly exaggerated press coverage of civil protests there in 2006 that alarmed tourists  --  unnecessarily  --  and did considerable harm to the livelihoods of the region . ARDEN ROTHSTEIN , New York , NY PRESENT SENSE ? I was appalled by Joan Caraganis Jakobson 's article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the December issue . As I sat this past Tuesday watching President Obama 's inaugural address , my attention was attuned to the current selfish and self-indulgent culture we have developed and impart to our children . As is the case with multitudes of American children , my own receive so many gifts each season that the novelty often subsides by the third or fourth present opened . How much more meaningful is the gift of charity ? Surely , that lasts longer and spreads farther . PAIGE M. SWIFT , Columbus , GA EDITOR 'S NOTE : Certainly , Jakobson is not entirely against donations to charity in the name of another . She was making a case for the prudent use of the practice , not dismissing it out of hand . KEEP YOUR FOCUS During these difficult economic times , when many may be looking for work and have very little else but despair , it is a good idea to give more attention than usual to our friends and family . We do n't do this enough , and especially not when times are good and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be our first priority in life . LOI AN LE , Brooklyn , NY THE LONG GOODBYE In renewing my subscription , I must take a moment to acknowledge " A Widow 's First Five Years , " by Barbara Lazear Ascher from " Dealing With Grief , " July 2007 . It has helped me through the last year . Everything she describes is the way it is . When my husband died , my life stopped . I am still on hold . How long ? CORINNE C. FAUERBACH , Fitchburg , WI CORRECTION : In our February issue , we misidentified the building shown on page 40 of our " San Francisco Opera " story . The building is city hall , not the War Memorial Opera House , which is located across the street . We always love to hear from you . Write to us at tnc@hearst.com .

I was lucky enough to receive a copy of her memoir , DVF : A Signature Life . The best part : she inscribed it " To Sabrina , Enjoy It All ! " So simple and yet so full of meaning . Of course , she used the boldest of markers and filled the whole page  --  a woman who is true , wonderful and enjoying it all ! SABRINA SPEER , Glen Ellen , CA
