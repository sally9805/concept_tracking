Split Second By David Baldacci Time Warner Columbus Rose , Ltd . EIGHT YEARS LATER The motorcade streamed into the tree-shaded parking lot , where it disgorged numerous people who looked hot , tired and genuinely unhappy . The miniature army marched toward the ugly white brick building . The structure had been many things in its time and currently housed a decrepit funeral home that was thriving solely because there was no other such facility within thirty miles and the dead , of course , had to go somewhere . Appropriately somber gentlemen in black suits stood next to hearses of the same color . A few bereaved trickled out the door , sobbing quietly into handkerchiefs . An old man in a tattered suit that was too large for him and wearing a battered , oily Stetson sat on a bench outside the front entrance , whittling . It was just that sort of a place , rural to the hilt , stock car racing and bluegrass ballads forever . The old fellow looked up curiously as the procession passed by with a tall , distinguished-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head and grinned at this spectacle , showing the few tobacco-stained teeth he had left . Then he took a nip of refreshment from a flask pulled from his pocket and returned to his artful wood carving . The woman , in her early thirties and dressed in a black pantsuit , was in step behind the tall man . In the past her heavy pistol in the belt holster had scraped uncomfortably against her side , causing a scab . As a solution she 'd sewn an extra layer of cloth into her blouses at that spot and learned to live with any lingering irritation . She 'd overheard some of her men joke that all female agents should wear double shoulder holsters because it gave them a buxom look without expensive breast enhancement . Yes , testosterone was alive and well in her world . Secret Service agent Michelle Maxwell was on the extreme fast track . She was not yet at the White House detail , guarding the president of the United States , but she was close . Barely nine years in the Service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents spent a decade in the field doing investigative work before even graduating to protection detail as shift agents , yet Michelle Maxwell was used to getting to places before other folks . This was her big preview before almost certain reassignment to the White House , and she was worried . This was an unscheduled stop , and that meant no advance team and limited backup . Yet because it was a last-minute change in plan , the plus side was no one could know they were going to be there . They reached the entrance , and Michelle put a firm hand on the tall man 's arm and told him to wait while they scoped things out . The place was quiet , smelled of death and despair in quiet pockets of misery centered on coffins in each of the viewing rooms . She posted agents at various key points along the man 's path : " giving feet " as it was called in Service parlance . Properly done , the simple act of having a professional with a gun and communication capability standing in a doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tall man , John Bruno , was brought in . She led him down the hallway as gazes from the viewing rooms wandered to them . A politician and his entourage on the campaign trail were like a herd of elephants : they could travel nowhere lightly . They stomped the earth until it hurt with the weight of the guards , chiefs of staff , spokespersons , speechwriters , publicity folks , gofers and others . It was a spectacle that if it did n't make you laugh would at least cause you considerable worry about the future of the country . John Bruno was running for the office of president of the United States , and he had absolutely no chance of winning . Looking far younger than his fifty-six years , he was an independent candidate who 'd used the support of a small but strident percentage of the electorate fed up with just about everything mainstream to qualify for each state 's national ballot . Thus , he 'd been given Secret Service protection , though not at the staffing level of a bona fide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him alive until the election . She was counting the days . Bruno was a former iron-balls prosecutor , and he 'd made a great number of enemies , only some of whom were currently behind bars . His political planks were fairly simple . He 'd tell you he wanted government off the backs of the people and free enterprise to rule . As for the poor and weak , those not up to the task of unfettered competition , well , in all other species the weak died and the strong prevailed , and why should it be any different for us ? Largely because of that position , the man had no chance of winning . Although America loved its tough guys , they were n't ready to vote for leaders who exhibited no compassion for the downtrodden and miserable , for on any given day they might constitute a majority . The trouble started when Bruno entered the room trailed by his chief of staff , two aides , Michelle and three of her men . The widow sitting in front of her husband 's coffin looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veil the woman was wearing but assumed her look was one of surprise at seeing this herd of interlopers invading hallowed ground . The old woman got up and retreated to a corner , visibly shaking . The candidate whirled on Michelle . " He was a dear friend of mine , " Bruno snapped , " and I am not going to parade in with an army . Get out , " he added tersely . " I 'll stay , " she fired back . " Just me . " He shook his head . They 'd had many such standoffs . He knew that his candidacy was a hopeless long shot , and that just made him try even harder . The pace had been brutal , the protection logistics a nightmare . " No , this is private ! " he growled . Bruno looked over at the quivering woman in the corner . " My God , you 're scaring her to death . This is repugnant . " Michelle went back one more time to the well . He refused yet again , leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did . What the hell could happen to him in a funeral home ? Was the eighty-year-old widow going to jump him ? Was the dead man going to come back to life ? Michelle sensed that her protectee was really upset because she was costing him valuable campaign time . Yet it was n't her idea to come here . However , Bruno was in no mood to hear that . No chance to win , and the man acted like he was king of the hill . Of course , on election day the voters , including Michelle , would kick his butt right out the door . As a compromise Michelle asked for two minutes to sweep the room . This was granted , and her men moved quickly to do so while she silently fumed , telling herself that she had to save her ammo for the really important battles . Her men came out 120 seconds later and reported everything okay . Only one door in and out . No windows . Old lady and dead guy the only occupants . It was cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate . Bruno could have his private face time , and then they could get out of here . Inside the viewing room , Bruno closed the door behind him and walked over to the open coffin . There was another coffin against the far wall ; it was also open , but empty . The deceased 's coffin was resting on a raised platform with a white skirting that was surrounded waist-high with an assortment of beautiful flowers . Bruno paid his respects to the body lying there , murmuring , " So long , Bill , " as he turned to the widow , who 'd returned to her chair . He knelt in front of her , gently held one of her hands . " I 'm so sorry , Mildred , so very sorry . He was a good man . " The bereaved looked up at him from behind the veil , smiled and then looked down again . Bruno 's expression changed and he looked around , though the only other occupant of the room was in no condition to eavesdrop . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In private . " " Yes , " the widow said in a very low voice . " I 'm afraid I do n't have much time , Mildred . What is it ? " In answer she placed a hand on his cheek , and then her fingers touched his neck . Bruno grimaced as he felt the sharp prick against his skin , and then he slipped to the floor unconscious . ( Continues ... ) by David Baldacci
