Objective : This study examined African American college students ' perceptions of psychosocial factors that influence racial disparities in health . Methods : We conducted focus groups in two Alabama Black Belt Counties from June to August 2005 . Data were collected using a standardize discussion guide , augmented by prompts for clarification . Results : Principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to identify patterns or the dimensionality of psychosocial factors identified by the students . Principal component factor analysis identified three patterns that accounted for more than 64% of the variance of psychosocial factors influencing racial disparities in health . Our findings indicate that many African American college students perceived racism/discrimination targeted at African Americans , mistrust of whites and of medical and public health institutions among African Americans , poverty and lack of health insurance as major psychosocial factors influencing racial disparities in health . Conclusion : Findings from this exploratory study indicate the potential influence of psychosocial variables on racial health disparities deserves further attention . In order to make measurable progress in eliminating racial disparities in health or closing the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical practitioners must consider the broader context of racism , mistrust of whites among African Americans and health insurance issues . Government and health care professionals need to work with African Americans and obtain the trust of their communities by addressing current perceived racism within the health care system . In addition , there remains a desperate need for health initiatives that target areas of persistent rural poverty , many of which are also home to concentrated racial/ethnic minority populations . INTRODUCTION <p> Despite tremendous progress in the use of preventive and life-saving medical technologies in America , racial and ethnic disparities in health persist . For example , mortality rates for stroke , heart disease , and HIV/AIDS are higher for African Americans than for whites . Disparities in health status between black and white Americans are so well documented and are of growing concern to policy makers ( U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2000 ) . <p> In response to President Clinton 's Initiative on Race , The Department of Health and Human Services is paying attention to racial disparities in the nation 's health . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's health policy for the Twenty-First Century , is to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health by the year 2010 . This unprecedented effort will require a major national commitment to identifying and addressing the underlying causes of higher levels of diseases and disability in the African American communities . In other words , identifying and understanding social factors ( psychosocial variables ) that help African Americans obtain needed health care or that hinder them from doing so is an important goal for social science researchers interested in the U.S health care system and eliminating racial disparities in health . Efforts to understand racial disparities in health should focus not only in terms of individual characteristics but also on social factors that sustain the disparities . <p> In this paper , we provide insights on rural African American college students ' perceptions of the psychosocial factors influencing racial disparities in health beyond those found in the biomedical model . This is because the role of psychosocial factors in helping or hindering individuals in obtaining needed health care has not received much attention in research on health disparities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables influencing racial differences in health and access to health care can help shape public opinions and influence the actions of policy makers in eliminating racial disparities in health by 2010 . RESEARCH METHOD <p> This study is part of a larger project that is examining racial health disparities in Alabama 's Black Belt . Data for this study were gathered through a focus group methodology - a qualitative approach especially well-suited for research that is exploratory as does the topic of this inquiry . Focus groups are widely used in health research as well as in sociological research to gain perspectives , enlightenment , and insight into the minds of participants as they discuss topics of interest to the research . A focus group study is a structured series of group discussions designed to reveal perceptions and opinions on a defined issue involving carefully selected participants who share common characteristics ( Bloor et al . 2001 ; Krueger and Casey 2000 ; Seale et al . 2003 ; Silverman 2000 ; 2001 ; Wilkinson 2003a ; 2003b ) . The objective of the focus group interviews conducted was to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing health disparities . <p> Ten focus groups with 6-12 members ( mean number of members = 7 ) in each were conducted from June to August 2005 . Focus group participants ( N=128 ) were recruited from senior centers , religious organizations , beauty salons , barber shops , and public housing in two Alabama Black Belt counties , fictitiously named Blacksville and Forestville . The participants learned about the study through flyers and volunteered to participate . Sessions were approximately two hours in length and were conducted by the authors in locations both familiar and accessible to participants , including senior centers , public housing facilities , restaurants , and county offices . Participants were served light refreshments during the sessions . The Study Area and Counties <p> Blacksville and Forestville are located in an impoverished area of Alabama known as the " Black Belt . " The Black Belt has been described as Alabama 's " underbelly " or " America 's third world " because of its chronic poverty ( Archibald et al . 2002 ) . While there is a distribution of African Americans across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belt . Of the 67 counties in Alabama , ten have a majority African American population , and these ten are located in the Black Belt . Quality of life in the Black Belt has been declining for the past several decades and African Americans in the Black Belt are well below national averages in income and education ( Falk and Rankin 1992 ) . Studies of illness and mortality have also indicated life in the Black Belt is quite harmful ( see Greenberg and Schneider 1995 ) . As Archibald and Hansen ( 2002 ) put it , " Doctors and hospitals are so scarce that pregnant women and sick residents must have to travel up to 30 miles to the nearest health clinic . " <p> Blacksville and Forestville are among the very poorest of all in America . Comparison of the two counties show a predominantly African American population ( 85.3 percent and 71.9 percent ) , households with individuals 65 years and over ( 27.4 percent and 28.7 percent ) in 2000 ( see Table 1 ) . Poverty rates for both counties ( 26.8 percent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 12.5 percent ) . A woman heads more than 14 percent of the African American families in these counties and this is also higher than the state rate of 8.1 percent . <p> About 25 percent of Blacksville residents are high school graduates compared with 30.3 percent in Forestville . In both counties , a greater problem is social isolation . Social life is almost entirely confined to the immediate neighborhood or within a cluster of similarly depressed neighborhoods that are linked by geographical proximity , kinship , marriage , car trading , and poverty . <p> Virtually all of the adults of these depressed counties grew up in poverty , either in the same locale or in similar circumstances nearby . They remain chronically poor today . Although most households have , at least one person employed most of the time , the work crews , on the night-shift janitorial jobs , and on factory assembly lines . Most households hover around the official poverty line , and are easily kicked below it by an accident , illness , or job loss . Some return home after a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the yare unable to participate effectively . In our research , we found that observed poverty and marginality were really the long-run social consequence of an earlier period of agricultural change . <p> Analysis Sample <p> In this analysis we focus on a subset of data made up of responses of undergraduate college students from these two counties that participated in the study ( n=50 ) . These students were on summer vacation when we conducted the study . Instrumentation <p> Following the focus group literature ( see Bloor et al . 2001 ; Krueger and Casey 2000 ; Seale et al . 2003 ; Silverman 2001 ; Wilkinson 2003a ; 2003b ) , we conducted all group sessions using a written discussion guide . The guide was divided into the following topic areas : introduction and warm-up ; introductory questions ; general perceptions of health and medical care ; general perceptions of health care providers ; general perceptions of medical research . The flow of the guide was intended to create a smooth transition from introduction to the key study question . Each topic consisted of an open-ended question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio taped . We took notes during the sessions . This allowed information such as intensity of discussion , facial expressions , and other interpersonal communication clues to be recorded ( for example , see Krueger and Casey 2000 ; Wilkinson 2003a ; 2003b ) . We ensured group members of confidentiality of the discussions . <p> During the focus group discussions , prompts which elicited perceptions on psychosocial factors were placed before the participants . Before the focus groups sessions began , respondents were asked questions in the following format " As you know , mortality rates from cancer , diabetes , HIV Infections/AIDS , heart diseases , and infant mortality weigh more heavily on blacks compared to whites . Do you think the racial disparities in health outcomes and health-care treatment are because , for example , many blacks do not have health insurance ? They were asked 12 questions related to racial disparities in health . Participants were advised to read carefully and circle the appropriate response that describes their feelings and beliefs . They had to indicate whether they agreed , disagreed , or did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analytical Procedure <p> We used audio tape recording of each focus group and the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences ( SPSS 11.5 , Chicago Ill ) for content and statistical analyses ( Seale et al . 2003 ; Silverman 2000 ; 2001 ) . Content analysis of the focus group discussions produces a relatively systematic and comprehensive summary or overview of the data as a whole , incorporating a quantitative element . In this research , content and quantitative analyses are used to address the research question of how often different psychosocial factors are mentioned as causes of racial disparities in health . Several strategies suggested by experts in qualitative research ( e.g. , Devers 1999 ) were used to ensure that the analysis was systematic and verifiable . Some of the strategies included consistent use of discussion guide and audio taping . <p> In the second phase of the analysis , statistical data reduction approach known as factor analysis was used to ascertain the minimum number of factors that can account for the observed covariation among the psychosocial factors . A statistical indication of the extent to which each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor loading . In other words , the higher the factor loading , the more the particular item contributes to the given factor . Thus , factor analysis also explicitly takes into consideration the fact that the items measure factor unequally . RESULTS <p> Of the 50 African Americans college students who participated in the focus group interviews , about 36% were males and 64% were females . More than 70% agreed that racial disparities in health outcomes exist because many black people do not have health insurance , are unemployed , or have poor eating habits . One student said , " health insurance plays a big role in how often people see the doctor . " Eighty percent indicated that the disparity is because of African Americans ' life style of dieting and exercise . More than 60% perceived that the disparity is because there are not enough doctors and nurses in many black communities , because of poverty , and because few African Americans in the health care fields . Fifty-eight percent perceived that racial disparities in health are due to lack of basic health care facilities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because black people do not trust medical professionals . Meanwhile , more than half ( 54% ) indicated that the disparity is due to environmental racism in black communities ( Table 2 ) . We provide detail about each of the major themes . Health Insurance <p> Most participants perceived that a high percentage of African Americans in the Black Belt are uninsured or underinsured . African Americans are the least able to afford regular medical checkups , prescription medicines , and even over the counter medications . Although African Americans are aware of early detection and screening of cancer , they tended to have a fatalistic view of their health outcomes once they have cancer . Because of fatalistic views and lack of health insurance , African Americans are less likely to take advantage of preventive services . <p> Another finding from the sessions is that uninsured African Americans are less likely to seek medical help until their illness has progressed to a serious state . For example , uninsured African Americans are more likely than those with insurance to be hospitalized for avoidable complications of conditions such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor 's office . In a disease such as cancer , where early detection is critical , African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage of cancer . Unequal Access to Quality Health Care Facilities <p> The availability and quality of health care services are not equally distributed in Alabama 's Black Belt . Several students commented that the likelihood that African Americans in the Black Belt would obtain early detection and screening for cancer and HIV/AIDS is hindered by lack of access to quality primary care physicians and health facilities . These rural poor have problems of access to health care as medical facilities and practitioners are not available locally ( see Lyson 1989 ) . For example , lack of access to health care contributes to a decrease in the availability and use of mammography , and an increase in diagnosis at later stages of breast cancer for black women . Both are associated with increase breast cancer mortality rates . There are immense physical and psychological barriers in these rural counties as well . The people interviewed responded that having money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the residents feel safe . <p> Increasingly , hospitals and ambulances that serve these rural African American communities are either closing , relocating , or becoming private ( see Zekeri 1996 ; 1999 ) . In Alabama , the likelihood of a hospital closing is directly related to the percentage of blacks in the community ( Falk and Lyson 1988 ; Lyson 1989 ) . Poverty <p> Another common context , other than health insurance and access to quality health care , that negative comments were routinely heard was poverty . These African Americans felt that variables mostly contributing to their increased incidence of cancer , HIV/AIDS , and other diseases are beyond the control of their personal behavior . In addition to poverty , oppressive forces such as segregation , substandard health care , and the subsequent feelings of meaninglessness , hopelessness , and social despair provide the environment for the emergence of cancer fatalism . As one 30-year-old respondent put it , " because of poverty blacks are less likely to take advantage of preventive services and the quality of health care they receive tends to be lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than whites to receive treatment in hospital outpatient clinics and emergency rooms , which are more often public than private . Whites are more likely to go to a private doctor 's office . Previous research findings indicated that this difference is largely because a greater proportion of African Americans are poor ( see Adler et al. , 1993 ; Cockerham 2001 ; Feinstein 1993 ; Haan et al. , 1987 ) . <p> An African American mother of two , who works as a nurses ' aide explained that poverty also can aggravate the hypertension suffered by African Americans , and various other acute and infectious diseases that are more common among people in the lower social classes . High rates of poverty among African Americans mean that they are less likely to receive early and adequate medical treatment . Not Enough Doctors and Nurses in African American Communities <p> Not enough doctors and nurses in black communities  --  many participants alluded to these when asked to explain racial disparities . They think that inadequate providers make good health care difficult . A female student said " many doctors do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor shortage in Alabama 's Black Belt Counties . " <p> Some spoke of white health care providers who belittled African Americans ' complaints , over-booked appointments and kept them waiting , and made it difficult for them to obtain the best care . Physician availability fluctuates by region and type of locale . Few doctors locate in low-income rural communities like the Alabama 's Black Belt , although some foreign-born doctors have done so . Alabama 's Black Belt Counties can not provide the expensive , sophisticated equipment and technical support personnel that many of today 's physicians prefer , and they do not comprise enough patients to justify high capital costs . In a system in which health care is based on ability to pay , a low-income county is not an attractive place for doctors to locate ; they can earn more money in predominantly white neighborhoods . Dieting , Exercise , and Lifestyle Choices <p> Overwhelming majority of the students believed that racial differences in many diseases such as cancer and heart disease is due to poor dieting , smoking , drinking , failure to get enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more likely to smoke , drink excessively , use drugs , get little physical exercise , and eat high-fat , high-sodium foods . This is an interesting finding because black-white comparison of health lifestyles in the United States show that whites often drink , smoke , exercise , and practice weight control more than blacks ( George and Johnson 2001 ; Johnson and Hoffmann 2001 ) . There is a contention that exercise declines more steeply for blacks than whites across the course of adulthood . Environmental Racism <p> Environmental racism , the tendency for the U.S. hazardous waste sites and polluting industries to be located in areas where the surrounding residential population is African American may also contribute to poorer health among African Americans . Although health care access and other social variables might account for some of the disparities in health , more than half of the participants agreed that the differences in environmental and occupational exposures also play a role . One male student stated that " there is a disproportionate placement of pollution-intensive industries and hazardous waste sites in African American communities . " African Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely than whites to work in hazardous occupations where they are exposed to toxic chemicals , dust , and fumes ( Anderton et al. , 1994 ) . Under-Representation of African Americans in Health Care Fields <p> African Americans are seriously underrepresented in the health care profession and this lack of representation is particularly significant for African American communities like Alabama 's Back Belt that rely on African American physicians for care . Many other participants felt that with so few African American health care professionals in the Alabama 's Black Belt , the control of the health care system lies almost exclusively in the hands of whites . <p> One male student said , " even when blacks complain of chest pains and other symptoms of heart disease , white doctors are less likely to take the complaints seriously . " No Trust in White Medical Professionals <p> Another serious issue that came out of the interviews is distrust in white health professionals by African Americans . African Americans are more reluctant than whites to seek treatment for HIV/AIDS because they distrust the government ( Jones 1993 ; Klonoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this is because of the infamous Tuskegee experiments conducted by the U.S. government for 40 years ( from 1932 to 1972 ) . For the experiments , 399 poor black men were recruited and led to believe that they would receive free medical treatment for what they called " bad blood , " while , in fact , they were left untreated for syphilis so that the government health researchers could study the impact of the disease on them . As in many national studies ( Thomas and Quinn 1993 ; 1991 ) , we found that the Tuskegee study is not far from African Americans ' consciousness . It has undermined their trust in public health officials and some African Americans have used it to justify HIV/AIDS conspiracy theories ( Gamble 1997 ; Parsons et al . 1998 ; Thomas and Quinn 1993 ) . <p> For African Americans , the legacy of Tuskegee generates anger that hangs in the air like smoke . The legacy is also a shadow over medicine and public health and is used as a reason not to take advantage of early treatment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living wage and health benefits abounds in these Alabama Black Belt counties ( see Zekeri 1996 ; 1999 ) . Many participants mentioned the difficulty of finding employment , particularly a job that pays a living wage . The reason for their difficulty in finding a job becomes more apparent when we recognize that certain segments of the population have extraordinarily high rates of unemployment , particularly young African Americans and other minority groups without a high school diploma . <p> Many African Americans are unemployed or employed in jobs that do not provide health insurance . Yet , access to health care services is related to ability to pay , and ability to pay is related to access to health insurance . Searching for work and coming up with nothing is a demoralizing experience . Consequently , some people in the Black Belt quit looking for a job after many unsuccessful attempts . Factor Analysis of Psychosocial Variables <p> Dimensionality of the psychosocial factors was explored by factor analyzing all items using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS 11.5 , Chicago Ill ) . Varimax rotations with iterations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrix was used in this exploratory factor analysis , because identification of the basic structuring of variables into theoretically meaningful subdimensions is the primary concern of the research . The varimax method rotates all factors until the factor loadings on all factors attain maximum variance . This means that each factor has items with either very high or very low loadings within the constraints imposed by the total variance of the loadings . Since this solution tends to give the most satisfactory alignment of factors with clusters of items , given the requirements of factor independence , it seems the most suitable solution of factoring ( Kline 1994 ) . <p> An examination of the eigenvalues , scree plots , and percent variance explained show that the psychosocial factors have loadings greater than .5 on at least one of three factors that have eigenvalues greater than 1.0 ( Table 3 ) . In other words , for the total sample , three fairly distinct patterns of psychosocial factors appeared ( racism , lack of trust in health professionals , and lack of health insurance ) . The criteria of eigenvalue greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on standardized items , the variance of a single item is 1 . Therefore , a factor whose eigenvalue is less than 1 explains no more variance than a single item . Further , decreasing eigenvalues usually mark the end of the identification for meaningful factors . In evaluating contributions of the items to the factors , the criterion of factor loadings greater than .5 is used because of the small sample size . <p> The orthogonally rotated factor loadings indicate that not enough doctors and nurses in black communities , racism in the health care system , and few minorities in the health care fields unambiguously load on the first factor , which explains 36 percent of the total variance ( Table 3 ) . The factor is designated as racism factor . The relatively strong statistical associations between racism in the health care system and this factor indicate that these students perceived the importance of racism in the health care system as influencing racial disparities in health . <p> The second factor is dominated primarily by lack of trust in medical professionals and employers in black communities do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of trust factor because it measures the extent to which these students think that black people do not trust health professionals . The factor explained 15.28 percent of the total variance . The third factor is dominated by lack of health insurance , inadequate health care facilities in many black communities and many blacks are poor . This factor is interpreted as general measure of health insurance and poverty . <p> The analysis revealed three distinct points of general agreement among the students regarding racial disparities in health . First , there is perceived racism in the care system . Second , the student perceived lack of trust in the medical professionals as essential determinant of racial disparities in health . Lastly , poverty and lack of health insurance play critical roles in health disparity . Those blacks who are poor tend not to have health insurance coverage . There is an undeniable need for health insurance for all in the 21st century . CONCLUSION <p> We conducted focus group sessions in two rural counties in Alabama 's Black Belt to examine African American college students ' perception of psychosocial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many African American college students perceived racism/discrimination targeted at African Americans , mistrust of whites and of medical and public health institutions among African Americans , poverty , and lack of health insurance as key factors influencing racial disparities in health . This is consistent with prior research that finds mistrust of whites among African Americans ( Gamble 1997 ; Jones 1993 ; Klonoff and Lanrine 1999 ; Parsons 1999 ; Thomas and Quinn 1993 ; 1991 ) . Moreover , there are major racial/ethnic differences in access to medical care in America ( LaVeist et al. , 2000 ; Lillie-Blanton et al. , 2000 ; Mayberry et al. , 2000 ; Van Ryan and Burke 2000 ) . We are therefore not surprised that these students perceived racism in health care as a problem , and thought that African Americans do not trust the medical system like the whites do . They used the Tuskegee Syphilis study as a significant source of mistrust of white medical practitioners among African Americans . Color remains a substantial barrier to getting good health care in America . Accordingly , rural African Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to a racial minority group and being nonmetropolitan residents increase the odds of poor access to good health care . <p> Having health insurance , more than any other demographic or economic factors , determines the timeliness and the quality of health care . One reason for lack of health insurance is the higher poverty rate among African Americans in these counties . In Alabama 's Black Belt Counties , money problems are constant in most of the families and periodic in the others . Conversations during focus group discussions frequently turn to the money problem . <p> The stress and worry about getting by is ever-present . Some help come from state Medicaid or the federal Medicare program for older people . But families sometimes incur medical costs when they have no insurance , and usually have to pay some portion of costs even when they are covered . There is often confusion about medical insurance or assistance  --  what it covers , when it expires , how far back it is effective , and whether the family is currently eligible . Medicaid is available to people with incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on welfare , but fluctuating incomes and re-certification problems leave many families without coverage . When a family is on welfare , Medicaid is almost automatically available , though it is not retroactive to cover previous medical bills , and does not pay the full bill . <p> The primary strength of this study is its methodology , designed to develop a theoretical framework for examining racial disparities in health . The qualitative approach is fitting to this objective and was implemented in a systematic way . Nevertheless , limitations of the study warrant note . First , the focus groups took place among one racial group in a limited geographic area . These were individuals recruited by the researcher , community liaisons , and community leaders . They were not randomly assigned to the focus groups . Therefore , those who participated may not be entirely representative of the African American community in these counties . Second , the sample was small and consisted of more females than males . During the many of the hours we spent in homes and offices , women outnumbered men . Some men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group meetings ; some men would find an excuse to leave the focus group meeting soon after it started . Because of these limitations , generalization of the findings should be with caution . <p> In sum , findings from this exploratory study indicate that the potential influence of psychosocial variables on racial health disparities deserves further attention . In order to make measurable progress toward eliminating racial disparities in health or closing the gap by 2010 , policy makers , program planners , and medical practitioners must consider the broader context of racism and mistrust of whites among African Americans . Since eliminating health disparities is important for the overall well-being of the entire society , there remains a desperate need for health initiatives that target areas of persistent rural poverty , many of which are also home to concentrated racial/ethnic minority populations . <p> Improving access to medical care for vulnerable populations , especially preventive services can play a role in reducing racial disparities in health . Also , increasing the numbers of African Americans in the health professions by concerted effort at recruiting is likely to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 2005 Rural Sociological Society Annual Meeting in Tampa , FL , August 8-12 .
