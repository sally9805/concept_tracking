The FIRST TIME VIOLA changed Jo into a wolf was the second time Jo got to see the big city . <p> Big for Jo , at least . She 'd grown up in Hay Springs out near the sandhills - a town , Mom said , six hundred and ninety-three souls strong last july with the birth of Marie 's baby sister just two hours shy of Independence Day . Bone-barren cold in the winter , Hay Springs was so humid come summer that most women cooked supper in their underwear , in plain view of anyone who happened to cut home across people 's backyards . Jo knew ( and did n't want to know ) that Mrs. Wurst wore hip-hugger briefs with tiny jumping frogs that shook and leapt to the buzz of her electric mixer . The only true bikinis in Hay Springs were hand-me-downs from big-city cousins . <p> Like this May with the candy-red bikini Jo 'd gotten in the mail from Cousin Jeanette . Ever since , Jo 'd wanted to run away to Omaha . Omaha , where Jeanette had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . As far as Jo was concerned , Jeanette had it all : a movie theater with six screens , a football field with permanent bleachers , a mall with real stores like the Limited and the Gap - no " Caroline 's Fashions for Young and Old " where Jo 's mom got her Levi 's and Fruit-of-the-Loom T-shirts . <p> And boys . Jeanette knew boys who bought their own cigarettes and drove their own cars and did n't think swiping a sixth of their dad 's Jim Beam meant they were cool . all summer , Jo wore Jeanette 's cherry-colored bikini top , cutoff shorts slung low enough to let a little bit of the red bottoms show . Stopping by Minute Mart for ice cream , hiking to and from Marie 's house , lying out on the cracked pavement of the only public pool for three counties - no matter what she did , in Jeanette 's bikini , Jo thought she could smell the city : metal , grease , the low burn of exhaust fumes like incense from the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field just outside Omaha , Jo thought more about Jeanette and the city and less about what it was actually going to be like , becoming a wolf . Viola had made Jo drive like she made her do everything else . Eight long hours , Jo kept both hands on the wheel , exactly two and ten o'clock . just like Dad told her when they 'd practiced on the Honda : brake and gas with the right foot , clutch with the left . The car was heavy , a big Ford truck . It did n't shift smooth like Jo was used to ( that close Japanese handling ) and the pedals were a million miles away . The truck was old , too , old like Viola herself , and the seats smelled of stale fries and spilled Coke , a high-school gym . Jo had figured Viola 's truck would smell more like her whole house - like witchcraft . Mint , basil , and wax . But Jo was getting used to being surprised by Viola Tisserand . <p> Jo sneezed often . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiping her nose on the back of one hand , she hoped Viola would n't give her the third degree for being gross , unladylike . <p> " I 've had really bad allergies my whole life , " she said to Viola . Short and shrill , Jo 's voice had a nasal quality like her sneeze . She hated it ; it made her sound childish , whiny . " I 'm on all kinds of medication for it . The pills dry me up pretty good , but I ca n't taste anything . Candy bars , hamburgers , bananas . all of it 's sorta like mashed potatoes . " <p> Viola kept her hands in her lap , one thumb pushing the wrinkles of the other , a plow making furrows . She seemed to be watching the dirt billowing up from the side road , dry and hot . Thank God Viola had air conditioning . Most old women who Jo knew from church practically lived in sod houses and drove Model T 's . No convenience . Convenience was a sin , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology . <p> " So I stop taking the stuff whenever I can sneak a pill into the toilet behind Mom 's back , " she said . " But then my nose runs , and if my mom finds out , she gets pretty ticked. all that money down the drain and everything . " <p> The setting sun shone hard in Jo 's side-mirror , a crystal flash that blinded her for a second , making her think for the first time all day why they were really there . White magic . Transformation . For a second her stomach hurt , a sharp tug stronger than the new cramps she 'd had for three days now . <p> Taking a bend to the right , Jo turned too fast , and her heart went with it . The truck fishtailed . Calm down , she thought . We 're not in that big a hurry . She told herself to breathe deep , through her mouth . <p> " You want to keep your body free from man-made materials for this kind of work , " said Viola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go . Viola had been schooling her in witchcraft for three weeks , and Jo was almost used to the old woman 's harangues on health and diet and proper behavior . " If your nose bothers you , Miss Joanna , you try a capsule of cayenne twice a day . Try it with strong tea-bourbon 's better , of course , but you 're too young to start all that . And stop eating French fries . They clog the heart and cloud the mind . Surely your mother does n't let you eat that junk . " <p> " You eat French fries , " Jo said . " I just saw you eat a whole box . A super-size . " <p> " Well , I can . I 'm past all that now . My heart and mind can be as slow and thick as I want them to be . " <p> As the truck crested a hill , Jo thought she could make out long shadows from the circle of pines some two miles off , but she did n't look long or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you have to look at something other than the road , " Dad had said , " you put those eyes back in three seconds . No more . " ) Jo hardly ever came out in the country because of her allergies . Pollen city . The clumps of crabtrees and maples and birch at the edge of each field looked tired , bent into each other like worn - out athletes . An unusually hot August this year , everyone was saying . A bad August for breathing . <p> Again that drag in her stomach and along her legs , a new deep space and pain she was n't used to . It embarrassed her , this period thing . It had come late , after all her other friends . just last night , looking over the Triple -A map , tracing Route 20 like a spider vein along a thigh , she 'd told Viola the truth - how she 'd lied to them , carried maxi-pads around in her backpack even though she did n't need to . Now shifting in the seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jo asked , " Are we getting close ? " Her voice was even tighter than usual , all n 's and ing 's . <p> " Do n't you be jumping the gun . " Viola turned to face Jo , and Jo 's cheeks got hot the way they always did when adults paid her special attention , picked her out of a crowd . " I told you . Three days after the first blood , full stomach , sunset on the eve of a new moon , and a mind as clear as running water . You 've got to focus all your energy to do this . You get sloppy , you get distracted and start your woolgathering , and you know what happens . " <p> " I could die . I know . You told me . " Jo did n't believe it . How could she ? She 'd seen a good deal of Viola 's shape-changing magic in three weeks : a squirrel into a prairie dog , a blue jay into a crow , and the riskiest one three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been a part of all that . Not once . just the words and then some blood , a sharp squeal of pain and that moment when one thing was between two things , the second when the air crackled , electric and blue . <p> " I remember , " Jo said anyway . " You do n't have to think I do n't remember the risks . I was only asking if we were close or not . It 's no big deal . " <p> It was amazing how much she had learned about Viola in just three weeks . Before , Jo had known her as the crazy woman down the street , the hag , the old bitch everyone talked about like talking weather . Then three weeks ago Viola had grabbed her elbow while Jo was minding her own business , walking to Minute Mart to meet her best friend Marie for ice cream and a Coke . Viola had asked her to help with the ladder ( " I have to get those leaves out of my drain pipe before fall " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she always had around people she thought of as touchers . Touchers . People who felt things to know them . Viola had wrapped her hand around Jo 's elbow , and Jo had felt that sting , that search like a doctor 's swab down your throat , and then a tug on her arm that said , She 'll suit . She 'll suit just fine . At that moment , Jo 's cheeks had burned so hot she 'd thought they were going to melt right off . <p> Now Viola twitched her skirt , ran her thumb and forefinger along a pleat ; Jo liked the way the polyester flowers whispered and shook between Viola 's fingers , as if blowing with a breeze . Viola tidied herself like she tidied everything else - flicking an eyelash off Jo 's cheek , arranging candles by smell and color , wiping the blood Jo 'd left on Viola 's toilet seat after figuring out her first tampon . It was her nature , Jo understood , putting things in their proper place . <p> " Are you old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you in love with some boy ? " <p> " I 'm only fourteen . " Jo rubbed the back of her hand against her nose , blocking her cheek from Viola 's sight . <p> " What difference does that make ? They sell sex to babies . " <p> Viola expected an answer . Her questions and answers were part of the method , trying to catch Jo in a lie , see if Jo was really worth her while . " Mike Sprague kissed me after a football game once last fall , " Jo said . " He was going with Tiffany Mullison , and he even told me so before he kissed me , but I did n't care . " <p> She liked the sound of that , I did n't care . It made her think of leather girls - sixteen - year - old city girls like Jeanette with bright lipstick and short - short tops that showed off their stomachs . <p> " His kiss was kinda gross , anyway . Like being swallowed . " <p> But Jo remembered that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , a physical thing , a shove against her face and chest . Mike had wrapped his jacket around her ; it smelled of stolen smokes and gasoline . When he slid his hands under her sweater and swallowed her mouth , she had touched his hairless face , polished smooth and firm by so much cold , a frozen cue ball . Jo remembered the ache that next day , her lips puffy and sore to the touch . She had touched them often . <p> " That 's the circle , " said Viola . Now close , the ring of pines blotted out a small corner of the great Nebraska sky . " Pull off here . " <p> Jo turned the wheel too fast ; the car slid to a stop . Dust swirled and settled , glittered like gold confetti in the strong light . Viola smoothed her blouse , old fingers checking each button in turn . " You 're nervous . This wo n't do at all . " Letting herself out , Viola slammed the door and walked toward the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viola , but her new , slow pain made her walk tender , as if she had fresh bruises on both shins . The air was hot , heavy ; it made Jo sneeze . " You know I only have a driver 's permit , " she called . " It 's driving on these stupid dirt roads . My dad 's taken me around the school parking lot a couple of times . That 's all . " <p> Viola stood quite still a few yards from the circle ; she did n't turn to face Jo . " There are times when I 'm sure of you , and there are times when I think I 've made a very bad mistake . I wo n't take a chance . Understand me . I will not take any sort of chance . If there 's anything you need to tell me , I suggest you do it right now . The incantation wo n't work if you have n't told me absolutely everything . " <p> " I have n't got anything to tell . " Jo chewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain from her mouth made her feel better , somehow , as if she really had something to tell , something hot and hard and bad . " I told you about Mike . I told you about the blood finally coming . " Jo tried to look Viola in the face but had to squint against the setting sun , now gold - the sort of gold that only came late in summer , full of pollen and heat and haze and the promise of a wet night . What Jo 's mom called an asthma sun , the kind of sun that made Mom drive Jo indoors . <p> " I guess if you 're lying , we 'll know right quick . " Viola unsnapped her purse , old - fashioned with the clasp on top , and found a pack of Virginia Slims . " We 've come too far to go back now . If you 've huckstered me into thinking you 're pure . Well . " She struck a match and cupped her hands to light up , a pro . <p> Jo 's throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vacuum cleaner bag or touched cats . She was here , after all , ready to change herself , ready for pain and even death , for chrissakes . Viola had picked her , special , but now she would n't let Jo feel special - instead she had to make it all a game , as if Jo had come to her first . <p> " I do n't get it , " Jo said . <p> It was time to lay it all out . all these weeks of ancient books and candles and personal questions , Viola making Jo catch the animals , stir the herbs , take out the trash , make peanut butter sandwiches and hot tea , Viola 's with two thimblefuls of bourbon . Then last week , coming up with the story about Viola 's ailing sister , the lie **25;1647;TOOLONG ( Viola 's sister was sick with cancer , but she lived in Chicago ) . Viola inviting Mom over for tea , her artful sighs and tight mouth and , who knows , a pinch of something in the snickerdoodle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And here they were . Finally . Jo needed Viola to look at her , look through her if that 's all she could get . Let her cheeks burn . If they were gon na do this thing , they 'd better be honest . <p> " You treat your body like crap . I do n't think the transformation 's gon na work with you sucking cigarettes and mowing down French fries . You said you did this when you were my age . How am I supposed to believe that ? You say one thing and do another . And I 'm the liar . " <p> Viola turned her wrist , sharp . It was the gesture she used to stop spells . <p> " Shut your mouth . " Viola turned toward Jo with those hard , black eyes , iris and pupil practically one . " What do you know about magic , Miss Joanna ? " Her voice was low , tight . " I use sunlight as thought . This field here 's my body . I 'm color and space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very badly . " <p> Viola blew the smoke hard , a punctuation mark . She looked younger somehow , loose through the hips . " You do n't know anything , " Viola said like she 'd just said the most important line in a movie , the one everyone would quote for a month . <p> Jo wanted to tell her that she did know stuff - how she always knew who was going to call a full minute before the phone rang , or how she knew Greg Peterson was going to die in that car crash last year , a feeling she 'd carried around for two days like the flu - but then Viola suddenly laughed , all teeth and wrinkles , eyes like lightning . And even though her hair , once gold , was gray and her face wrinkled , Jo could see that Viola had been beautiful . For the first time , Jo wondered if Viola had ever been touched by a boy , touched so the tips of her own hair brushing against her shoulders caused a shiver . <p> Viola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't even know about taking a man inside you , " she said . Between Viola and Jo was so much of this big , blue bowl of sky it all made Jo feel off-kilter , out of her element . Small . " Making him soft or sad as you pull him in . Or about blood , even though I 'm sure you think you do . Or a baby ripping apart your insides and wriggling its head away from you . Like you 're its pain . " <p> Jo did n't know exactly what she meant , but she could feel a weight in Viola , a heavy need like a distant siren , a phone call late at night , a boy who looks at you once with force and heat and looks away . Jo knew that weight . <p> " What could you possibly know about purity , Miss Joanna Murray . " Viola flicked her cigarette into a heap of brown stalks , broken corn plants piled up for the thresher . " You ca n't even talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped on the glowing end of the butt , grinding it hard with her heel , tidying up . Something had settled between them , a handshake of sorts , a pact or a deal - Viola tired but ready , Jo not knowing what was ahead but still wanting to know . Wanting to know so much she shook with it , her stomach a knot , her nose running so she had to use the bottom of her shirt to wipe it when Viola was n't looking . <p> And so it began . A thousand red rays shone through the pine needles as they walked toward the circle , and Jo wondered what it 'd be like if they pierced her , riddled her body with holes of light . These trees were the one upright thing for miles and miles , and the land seemed to gather its folds and furrows into the circle , stretching itself as if to come together at this single point . <p> Inside the light changed , grew dense . With just her fingertips touching the rough bark of a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Now warm and damp , Jo imagined this circle in winter : the silent field , the pines heavy with snow , scattering on the wind like ash , the clean cold . She saw herself running , lungs hard with the scrubbed , cold air , a trickle of sweat beneath her jacket and sweater , wet between her growing breasts . <p> Removing plastic baggies from her purse , Viola got everything ready . Loose herbs , candles , a box of kitchen matches . " What do you hear ? " she asked Jo . <p> " I do n't know . The wind , I guess needles rubbing against each other . " <p> " And ? " Viola lit three candles with one match . Small and neat , she sprinkled herbs around the candles as if seasoning a soup . <p> Jo closed her eyes , listening . " And a train a long ways away . A car . Maybe a truck . Probably a truck ; it sounds big . Lots of tires . A bird calling from somewhere pretty close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now cast the circle like I taught you . Keep your chin up . " <p> Jo fixed her gaze far away , through the pines to the flat horizon . She took off her clothes , shoes and socks first , folding her jeans and shirt on top . She tucked her underwear and bra between them , hidden . The wind , hot , caught her hair , strands in her mouth and across her eyes . Jo kept her hair long even though it got in the way , stuck in car doors and tangled in the straps on her backpack . It was like having a thousand tiny fingertips . Now they felt the wind , tapped her bare back and shoulders . She 'd never been outside and naked . <p> Jo could sense Viola deep against the trees , her shape just a trace in the shadows , a pencil sketch waiting for color . Maybe a reminder or something she could not help , Viola murmured the words along with Jo , but Jo 's voice above hers was higher , fuller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the circle was cast , Viola asked , " What do you see ? " <p> Jo kept her eyes shut . " A yard full of flowers . A clothesline . There 's one sheet left to take in - white . The wind 's come up , and it 's snapping pretty hard . A pile of stones , I think , some kind of wall . An old , plastic pool . The ones little kids use in summer . " But Jo saw more . Holes of light through pines . Sunset like fire . Long brown stalks , brittle and rotting . The purple vapor of night . <p> " Are you scared ? " asked Viola . " Do you think you 're set ? " Her voice was rapid , machine-gunning the words . <p> " Yes . " Shivering first inside , then out , Jo 's skin prickled cold , even in the heat , her nipples hard - a pull in her stomach as if someone was yanking a string . <p> " Now what do you smell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouched closer to the ground , needles pricking her palms . Her nose , she thought , her useless nose . Only pine and dirt , faint . She imagined her nose like a radiator grill , close to the land and moving fast , and she caught a sweet smell with a metal bite , sticky and sharp - a smell that widened and grew heavy . Her own body . She tilted back her head , wind like water over her face . A smell of rot , sweet like her own skin but with a foulness she could not name . That last smell was night . <p> " Now think . What do you feel ? " Jo felt , every inch , every nerve . Each hair - head , arms , back , legs - vibrated like little heartbeats . Jo felt the sun slip under the horizon line , the fierce hot heat of day now a low heat coming off the Earth , yeasty and expandable like new bread , the heavy ache of smooth , new breasts pulled toward the Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicious drag of contracting muscles deep inside . <p> Jo let herself remember a time before Mike . A secret - one she 'd never told anyone , not even Marie . Especially not Marie . <p> It had happened the first time she 'd been to Omaha . Twelve years old , Jo had gone with Marie to visit family . They 'd spent their first day in the city at the new Leid Rainforest , touching shark bellies under glass and drinking sick-sweet Sharpies until their tongues were purple . They both got sunburns : shiny red noses , shoulders , thighs . <p> That night Marie 's parents stayed with relatives - Marie 's mom had swollen ankles from walking too much with the baby almost due . But the two girls slept over at her older brother 's - Brad , a freshman at Creighton . An adventure . The three of them stayed up making fun of Saturday Night Live , and Jo watched Brad 's leg from the comer of her eye , the way he bounced it all the time as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sore and much too warm in down-filled sleeping bags , Marie woke up with a bad dream , something about dark hands and a man in an antique cape . Leaving Jo alone in the family room , Marie went to her brother 's room where it was cooler . <p> But Jo could n't get back to sleep ; her thighs and face throbbed . Instead she got up , hair sticky with sweat , wet strands across her forehead . In the blue light of early morning , she inched open the door of Brad 's room . Brad was asleep in his bed , breath even and low , Marie in her sleeping bag , curled on the floor across the room . <p> At the time , Jo told herself that she just wanted to roll up next to Marie , but she lifted the comforter and slipped beside Brad . Eighteen , Jo thought , he 's eighteen . Brad woke up and said , " Jo , " not a question , and put his hand between her legs . hot and strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pure pleasure . Then he 'd whispered , " You 'd better get out of here . " <p> That 's how Jo felt now , a wave of pleasure and pain along her legs . Wondering if she would die - she had n't told Viola everything , had kept something bad from her - another wave hit Jo from the deep pit of her stomach , then wave upon wave . The air smelled like singed hair . <p> As if from a long distance , like the click and delay of an overseas phone call , now Jo heard Viola 's voice ask what she could taste , but now the language was n't English . Instead the sound barked at her , clipped edges and vowels from the front of the mouth , just behind the teeth . Jo realized Viola was n't from Nebraska , her sound all East , Boston or New York . <p> Tasting salt , a sting in her mouth , Jo moved to the edge of the trees . She was still alive , after all . The magic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no longer a girl , held her to the land , and as she left the circle of pines , her limbs lithe and fast , her body parallel to the ground , Jo , no longer a girl , saw herself run so fast that the world fell away , and whatever she thought happened . <p> At first she was n't sure where to go . The whole Earth rang for Jo , no longer a girl but a wolf , corn and wind and night sky ringing with sharp sounds like blades meeting . Jo followed these sounds along an old creek bed to a farmhouse . Here the neat yard , the clothesline . The snap , snap of a sheet , bullets in the breeze . Here the rock wall and plastic pool , gaps in the rock where animals hid or lived , fat and small and pink . A line from a song she did n't recognize , Jo thought , sometimes lovers begin this way too , although her thoughts were smells and sights and sounds : tender plants waiting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , needing to be hoed ; small footprints in the lawn like a promise ( a lazy circle from afternoon , a child playing ) . <p> Viola laughed . From a distance of half a mile , it sounded like a raveled sleeve , a pull and thread of laughter . " The land ! " she yelled at Jo . " The land and the sky . The trees and the corn . The Moon and the stars . All yours ! " She laughed again . " Take it . Take it all ! " Jo understood Viola 's hunger then , knew what it meant to want and to lose and occasionally to have . <p> Jo knew , too , the many names . Viola had taught them to her . La loba , Rozsomk , Na ' ashj'ii Asdz , Numina , La Hueseia , Dakini . These were girl-wolf names , names she did n't like very much , especially now , her million hairs touching the air , feeling everything , wanting everything-a plump child , for instance , his thick salt-blood losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't feel anything like these words , these metaphors : a dancing mist , a spider or light or bone . She did n't even feel like a wolverine . She just felt like Jo : a teenager . <p> With Viola so far away , her long black silhouette like the leg of a fox , Jo thought how much she loved her , would always love her , for sharing the magic . But this field - the good mud , the sky a black vault , the ground-hogs and rabbits and squirrels , the promise of a child , the ring of pines this field was Viola 's way . <p> Jo left the farmhouse ( not yet ready for children ) , whipping and spinning through the dead summer corn , rustling stalks like whispers . Knowing now that secrets could n't harm her , that Viola did n't know and did n't need to know everything , Jo made plans . She knew that later she would flee from farmers , chase rabbits , steal a child . But tonight , Jo needed something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for teenagers to race along dry riverbeds or dig soil sharp with the stench of old tomato plants . The field could have too many leg traps , too many farmers with ready rifles . Jo wanted the city . She wanted what Jeanette had ; she wanted Omaha , to run low and fast , lights and glass and asphalt melting past , a harsh blur . She wanted to run early in the morning , very early , the time when another wolf could be smelled two miles off , his smell so different from hers , not sweet or metallic but like meat - like gasoline . <p> She howled . Her howl was long and deep and not for fun . Jo howled , and then turned toward the city . <p> - for C.B. <p> Author Affiliation
