Write What You Sell <p> " Bellevue may be the only municipal hospital in the country to have a literary review .... The review was founded two years ago by Dr. Ofri and Dr. Martin Blaser ... " to touch upon relationships to the human body , illness , health and healing .... ' " - " A Literary Review at Bellevue ? Believe It ! , " Dinitia Smith , The New York Times , October 2 , 2002 I HAD worked at Hammock Industries for twenty-seven years now , and enjoyed mostly every minute of my tenure there . From my earliest days in the stockroom , filling orders for our loyal customers , to my ascent through the ranks of management to my present position , Assistant Vice-President for Purchasing , my hours of employment had been filled mainly with excitement and satisfaction . Oh , I suspect most people would have found the engineering and selling of sump pumps to be a boring job . But not me ! I knew that Hammock Industries created a solid , reliable product which people-often quite desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a home-owner or businessman who finds his basement or warehouse flooded , and his immediate relief when he hears the powerful sucking sound of a Hammock Flowmaster 8000 surging into action , then you can picture some of the daily spiritual rewards I received . And the business was always changing . Hammock Industries hardly stood still ; we simply could n't afford to , in the face of competition from such deadly rivals as Pettygrove Products and Liquid Removal Systems . We made a point of introducing new technologies on a regular basis . I can readily recall such thrilling highlights as the substitution of silicone gaskets in place of rubber ones across all lines , and the creation of the digital control panel on the MegaSiphon XPR . I had no complaints about my salary or benefits . ( After my first decade with Hammock Industries , I made enough so that Janey had been able to stay home with the youngest two kids . ) My co-workers were a bright and funny group of people , especially Jim Blick down in Accounting ( you should have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . And the reserved parking space just steps away from the front door was a really sweet perk ( although I had been contemplating parking a little farther away , just to burn off a few extra calories and hopefully reduce the ol " spare tire inflated by the tasty fare at the H.I . cafeteria ) . So why was n't I the happiest man in Squaw Blanket , Idaho ? One reason only . This latest crazy plan dropped on my shoulders by the company 's owner , Roger Hammock III . And today was the day I had to report some results to my boss . Results which I just did n't have a lot of faith in . Very nervously , carrying a portfolio , I entered the office of " RH3 . " ( That 's what we joshingly called him behind his back . ) There he sat , a ginger-haired , ruddy-faced fellow a decade or so younger than me . His blue suit came not from Wal-Mart , like those of myself and the other managers , but from some fancy store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been educated out East , and he had picked up and retained some wild and weird ways that frequently disconcerted the average resident of Squaw Blanket . Legend had it that he had contemplated becoming some kind of artist or writer during his undergraduate years . But that plan had been scotched when he had to rush home to take over the business after the tragedy involving his father , when the older man had been buried under tons of mud while inspecting the workings of a balky Squeeze-Genie Plus at the bottom of a faultily shored ditch . This new brainstorm was typical of the son 's outlandish notions . On the wall behind my boss hung portraits of his father and grandfather . I had started when RH2 had been at the helm , and RH1 had even still been alive , stopping in at the office once a month , just to shake his cane at whatever new-model pump baffled him . " What ! No horsehair bushings ! How does the blamed thing function ! ? ! " We had all had a big chuckle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to sympathize with RH1 's frustration with the unstoppable march of progress . RH3 ceased looking at some correspondence and spoke heartily but commandingly to me . " Mewborn , take a seat ! " I sat down tentatively . " I 'm sure you 've finally got a full mockup of the new project there with you . Spread it out ! Let 's have a look ! " Reluctantly , I opened my portfolio and took out a substantial mass of printout , spiral-bound . I set the mockup down on the desk . RH3 's eyes gleamed . " Mewborn , this is the moment I 've been waiting for . At last , Hammock Industries is going to publish its own literary review ! " " Sir , you might wish to temper your enthusiasm until you scan the tentative table of contents and some of the , erm , texts . As you requested , I 've tried to gather together some , ah , " scintillating Joan-Didion-style essays and transgressive Kathy-Ackerish fiction . " not to mention some examples of " New Wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this project just are n't available here at H.I . You 've required me to produce something for which we have no pool of ready talent . " RH3 sat back disgustedly in his big chair . " Nonsense ! There 's got to be enough talent here to launch a simple literary review ! My God , if they can do it at Bellevue with a bunch of screwballs , surely we can do it here , with our superior employees ! " Bellevue . How I hated that name ! Ever since Mrs. RH3 had spent a few hush-hush months there on the advice of her local doctor and RH3 himself had learned of that hospital 's foray into magazine publishing , my life had been fraught with queer new responsibilites and alien concepts . Thumbing the first sheet of printout , done on heavier stock , RH3 studied it for a moment before speaking . " I ca n't say I 'm wild about this cover . It looks just like one of our brochures ! " I had to admit that the cover illustration was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned ) consisted of hundred-year-old engravings of our very first pump , the Mechanical Mule Bellows , flanking the title : The Hammock Industries Inspirer . The image I had chosen to grace the rest of the cover was a photograph supplied by Connie Riedesel down in Packing : a shot of her young son Wesley riding a state-of-the-art Bilgebuster AAA as if it were a hobbyhorse . " Well , I honestly thought , sir , that getting an image of our product up front was important . After all , this , ah , magazine is intended to publicize our business , is n't it ? " " Of course it is , damn it ! But it 's also meant to be an exploration of creativity and the human spirit ! We 're striving for a high-class , artistic outlet that showcases the passion and dreams of our workers . Not tradeshow propaganda ! " " Well , perhaps the cover could use a redesign . But I 'm sure the actual contents will come closer to your vision , sir . " " So long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave you , I 'm sure it will . You also studied those issues of Conjunctions , Glimmer Train , McSweeney 's , Crank ! , and the Mississippi Review , did n't you ? " " Of course , sir . " " Very good . Now , let 's have a look inside . " RH3 jumped past the table of contents and began to read the first entry . His rapidly furrowing brow signaled no good reaction , and I sought to forestall any chastisement . " ' The World Sucks Like a Sump Pump , and Then You Die . " Contributed by Ed Tappet 's daughter , Joan , sir . She was recently suspended from Westlake High for smoking in the girls " lavatory , so I thought she 'd do nicely for our " transgressive " author . " " This , this-this is mere whining and annoying teenager slang , Mewborn ! I ca n't imagine an audience used to William Vollmann 's dashing escapades getting excited over this ! What else do you have here ? " " Turn to page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " RH3 read only a few paragraphs before thwacking the mockup with the back of his hand . " What do you call this farrago , Mewborn ? I 'm referring to " It Never Ends , " by one Shirley Vester . " " Ah , the aforementioned " new wave fabulism , " sir ? " " New wave fabulism , my ass ! This is nothing but a group of recognizable characters from a popular sitcom plunked down in Disney World discussing the reputed inefficiencies of our Quality Control department ! " I grabbed frantically for some buzz words I had picked up in my studies . " I thought Shirley conveyed the , um , " plastic hyper-reality " of Disney World very boldly . " Now RH3 scanned the table of contents , rattling off titles dismissively . " ' Hoses and Roses . " " The Donkey Engines of my Heart . " " Born to Clean Filters . " " Pimps of the Plains and their Ida-ho 's . " " Elk Lodge Hell . " This is all amateur trash , unfitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even the editors of a genre magazine would publish such drivel ! " I hung my head and murmured , " I did my best , sir , with the talent available . " RH3 leaned forward and fixed me with a hard glare . " Not a sufficient excuse , Mewborn . A real editor is expected to motivate his contributors to exceed their perceived limitations . Do you even have any conception of what a story is ? What constitutes authentic Wolfean-Thompsonian New Journalism ? Your selections here are half-baked water-cooler ramblings , unacceptable in any literary review worthy of the name ! As for approaching the greatness of true literature - literature that would reflect the entire range of human emotions and aspirations as contained within the walls of Hammock Industries , both Plants One and Two - they are an absolute farce ! " I was silent for a whole minute . " Well , Jim Blick has some really funny stories from his weekends in the National Guard - " RH3 actually growled then . He tossed the mockup I had worked so hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending you to school ! " " To - to school , sir ? " " You heard me ! You 're heading out East , to Wesleyan or Sarah Lawrence or Bennington or Swarthmore , whichever one of those editor-producing institutions will have you . You 'll take an intensive one-year course , learning all there is to know about fiction and essays and magazines . Or at least enough for our purposes . And when you get back here , you 're going to produce a publication that will make the Pans Review look like Lady Churchill 's Rosebud Wristlet ! " My head was spinning , and I had no idea of who all those colleges and magazines were , or what the next year of my life was going to be like , or what Janey would have to say about all this . In my desperation , I ought to cling to the one bastion of my life . " Ah , sir , perhaps you could pick a university located in some swampland , at least ? Then in my spare time perhaps I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models , such as the Black Hole Cyberpump .... " RH3 looked irritated for a moment , then brightened . " Capital idea , Mewborn ! Let 's see , now . I believe the Charles River in Cambridge has been known to flood its banks from time to time - " " I 'm six feet under . Where are you ? " <p>
