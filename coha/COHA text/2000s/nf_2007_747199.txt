WE ARE WALKING up the bed of a gently graded waterfall in Bahia , Brazil . It is the dry season and the water  --  so clear and dark with tannins that it looks like strong tea  --  cascades through shallow pools to the left , leaving an expanse of smooth pink sandstone for us to climb . Roy Funch , a local ecologist and guide , is hunting for something he spotted from a helicopter last year , some remains of the frontier-mining culture that gave this region its name , the Chapada Diamantina , or diamond tablelands . <p> At the top , we push our way through some thorny scrub , rock-hop across the river , and find two rows of slabs stacked about a foot high . To me they look like suburban landscaping , but Funch  --  a wiry , spry American expat  --  explains that they are part of a double-walled canal used to pan for diamonds since the nineteenth century . The diamond miners who built this canal used it like American gold prospectors used sluices , to control the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panned . We see , a few yards away , Brazilian-style frontier cabins made of more unmortared sandstone slabs . Cacti grow up through the blocks , and inside are the brittle remains of roofing and bedding material . The buildings have n't been occupied in a while  --  Funch guesses a couple of decades  --  but the construction style suggests they were built during the Bahia diamond rush in the 1840s , before the gold rush in California . Back then , the mountains and valleys of the 15,000-square-mile Chapada Diamantina were crawling with prospectors sifting every bit of gravel for the dull glow of a raw diamond and leaving behind such structures , which reflect the rugged , ramshackle lives of their erstwhile inhabitants . <p> " We 're the first , " says Funch , who resembles a Brazilian hill-town version of Leonard Nimoy , but we 're not really the first to visit since the miners left . Guides often bring travelers through the Marimbus Marsh , a maze of rills between stands of papyrus and water hyacinth , to swim in the waterfall . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the first to see their significance as symbols of the inflection point between living culture and archaeology . <p> Funch is admittedly an amateur archaeologist , but he 's the only one paying these sites any mind  --  he takes photos and GPS readings at each one . " It 's always nice to add a couple of new houses to my collection , " he says , which numbers over 100 . But frontier-mining sites are studied by archaeologists all over the world , and those investigations might guide a study of the Chapada Diamantina : who lived there ; how they survived , communicated , and altered the landscape ; and how successful they were in seeking their fortunes . <p> <p> LOCATED 250 MILES from the Atlantic coast , the Chapada Diamantina looks like the American Southwest with green stubble . There was little besides natural beauty to distinguish the roadless region until 1844 , when diamonds were found . In his guidebook on the region , Funch writes that at that time diamonds easily could be plucked from streams or sifted out of thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the craws of chickens to look for swallowed diamonds or scan the ground for them after a heavy rain . Slaves of African descent were used in the early mining operations , but the diamond trade here lacked much of the conflict and dark political overtones of the modern industry . It resembled , in its techniques , wild lifestyle , and petty exploitations , frontier gold rushes in the United States , Australia , and other places around the world . With the influx of mostly Brazilian miners , the towns of Lenis and Mucug grew quickly , just like Scagway and San Francisco during the Alaska and California booms . For the next several decades , industrious and desperate men marched into the mountains and returned to the towns to spend their diamonds on booze , women , and overpriced provisions . The miners found shelter in the mountains by walling off natural overhangs and building freestanding stone cabins . <p> Within a couple of decades , the easy diamonds were gone . A run on super-hard black diamonds , or carbonados , in the late nineteenth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became viable with the black diamonds from Brazil , " says Funch , and the diamonds were used to tip drills that dug the Panama and Suez canals and tunnels all over Europe . Cheap , synthetic diamonds returned the region to its century-long , bleeding decline . Diamonds trickled out of the mountains at a survival level  --  searching for them was no longer a get-rich-quick strategy , but a subsistence lifestyle , a trade passed from father to son . Lenis became a musty relic of the rush days , an inhabited ghost town . <p> As the adventure travel industry arrived in the Chapada over the last decade , Lenis became a safe , charming , New World mountain town with lively restaurants , barrels of aged cachaa , and cobblestone streets . But in 1978 , when Funch first arrived , it was dirty , poor , and forgotten . " The town had been falling apart for 130 years , " says Funch , who studied the Chapada 's vegetation for his Ph.D . Most able hands had fled to the cities , but Funch explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still living in the stone shelters their forebears built . " All the miners would invite me out to their digs , " he says . " It was like living in the Western films I had seen of the gold rush or the post-gold-rush phase . " <p> Funch learned about panning for diamonds and the mountain-man mythology . Diamonds were beings made of energy , the old miners told him , glowing brightly and calling out to their chosen discoverers . The diamonds ' energy took the form of women  --  white ones for white diamonds , black ones for carbonados  --  driving men mad with longing . <p> This army of wildcatters left their marks on the Chapada , which is now a national park . " It 's actually amazing what one old man and a dog and limitless water and endless time can do  --  the amount of destruction that can be done , " says Funch , whose post as the park 's first director put him at odds with the old-time diamond panners . " These guys could destroy acres of land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural plots , diverted rivers , and washed the thin soil off entire valleys . <p> Such blights on the landscape are among the most important archaeological records of frontier-mining sites . Diversion of water , the need for fuel , and general disregard have resulted in local ecological catastrophes that look remarkably similar from country to country , from rush to rush . <p> Don Hardesty of the University of Nevada , Reno , sees these patterns . Frontier-mining archaeological sites across the world , he says , have so much in common that they can be examined as a whole and shed light on one another . In an article he is writing for an upcoming volume on frontier-mining archaeology , he posits that these sites are laboratories for historical ecology , or the study of how human-environment interactions affect landscapes . The ecosystems of the Chapada Diamantina , for example , are the canvases on which this history was written , in a language that has already been deciphered at other sites around the world . <p> In the Otago gold-rush region of New Zealand , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to archaeologist Ian Smith of the University of Otago . From their modes of use and construction , he says , archaeologists have been able to show how miners from different parts of the world brought their own ideas and resourceful methods , often within the same water system . The evolution of water-control techniques in the Chapada , from handworking a streambed , to guiding a creek , to diverting a river to sweep a hillside clear , can show how and when certain regions were worked , and potentially who worked them . These techniques and other technological aspects of mining are passed within and among communities , just like an artistic style , in what Hardesty calls " sociotechnical networks . " They reflect , in patterns of water control and deforestation , the social organization of the Chapada 's diffuse mining community . <p> <p> A FEW DAYS AFTER visiting the waterfall , we walk uphill through Lenis and down again into the narrow canyon of the Ribeirao River . We leave the trail to hop and climb our way through a five-mile stretch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , water trickles right through the canyon walls , creating slick , slime-coated surfaces Funch calls " bacterial teflon . " The valley is laced with canals , stone dwellings , and denuded hillsides . It is a landscape worked and reworked by generations of busy , desperate hands . <p> A few hours later , halfway up the side of the valley , we find our first shelter , built directly under an enormous boulder that seems to teeter over us . Some of the stones have collapsed , but this site had been occupied very recently . The last occupant was a daft old woman who , when she was not sifting through pebbles , drank and chased her husband  --  who lived on the nearby valley floor  --  with a machete. various bits of junk litter the area : a metal fork , some melted plastic , part of a chair charred in the fire that killed the old woman two years ago . And beneath the bricks and the dirt floor or in the surrounding weeds , there is a century or more of the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NPS ) has surveyed hundreds of such solitary mining sites from the Alaska gold rush , according to NPS archaeologist Becky Saleeby . The most commonly found artifacts are mining tools , such as shovels filed to a point to scrape out sluice boxes , and evidence of subsistence food production with an uncommonly high degree of improvisation , ingenuity , and adaptive reuse , such as cans pounded flat to make roof tiles or perforated to make strainers . " Whatever they had , they figured out another way to use it , " says Saleeby . But the differences between the sites can often be more telling , she says . One group of cabins on the Charlie River in the Yukon , for example , all had birdhouses , perhaps evidence of a single bird-lover in the group . The size of cabins , the quality of workmanship , and the presence of ceramics or unique artifacts can tell archaeologists whether a woman lived on the site , how successful a group of miners were , or whether the inhabitant loved the freedom of the mining lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stories about the valley residents , it is not surprising that remnants of tobacco and alcohol are also common at virtually all frontier-mining sites . " When I came here , every male above school age was a miner , " says Funch . " You were either a drunk or a miner . Or a drunk miner . " <p> Hardesty explains that despite the loneliness of the remote camps , studying the miners ' social interaction is key to understanding them . Careful examination of a modest assemblage of trash , for example , could yield insights into the structure , endurance , and level of communication for an entire community . He also notes that frontier mining is associated with rapid change and flexibility in social structures , much like sites associated with refugees , political unrest , or war . On this point , the grinding steadiness of the Chapada 's long decline may break with other frontier-mining situations . The old woman 's husband , for example , spent 60 years , on and off , trying to access what he thought would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching , even if he had found his treasure . <p> We continue down the valley , hopping from one precarious boulder to the next , the camera around my neck bouncing off rocks as I reach out to catch myself . We shimmy through a smooth tunnel under a boulder the size of a four-story building , and stumble across another stone mining cabin every 15 minutes or so . <p> " Follow me , " Funch says , as he turns abruptly off the path and up a hillside covered in eye-high dry grass . " They call this stuff grease grass , " he says . " I do n't know why . " I develop my own theory . The field has a pungent botanical smell and leaves a sticky film on my hands and clothes . But because the grass almost completely conceals the I steep , rocky ground , it is difficult to find purchase . I slip face-first a hall-dozen times . It 's sticky , smelly , and slick . Out of breath , I stumble out of the chute of greasy grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure built in the imposing shadow of a giant boulder . It has a commanding view of the valley , but this site is different  --  it appears occupied . There is no door and no one home . The inside is dank , with sooty walls ( a fire at night keeps mosquitoes away ) , a small grill over the hearth , a shelf for sleeping , some ratty clothes , and some plastic bottles of a mysterious dark brown liquid . It is simple , but after days of thinking about these structures from an archaeological viewpoint , it appears as a complicated , precious relic . I thought I had been looking at history in these stone cabins , plotting out how an archaeologist might see them . But here was a place that lashed archaeology to the present , where the transition from earthenware to metal cans continued through to plastic bottles . <p> <p> " THERE HAS BEEN a very visible break in the mining tradition because all these miners learned from their fathers , who learned from their grandfathers , and now their sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all guides , " says Funch when we return to Lenis . " There 's an incredible amount of knowledge that is necessary to do mountain mining . " It has not , for better or worse , been passed on , but a few diamonds still trickle out of the mountains . <p> On a side street back in town , behind simple , ill-fitting , and unsecured wooden shutters , far from the showrooms of Antwerp or the dangerous mines of Angola or Sierra Leone , is one of Lenis 's few diamond traders . In a tiny , airless room , where a sweaty old man polishes a vanishingly small diamond , the merchant pulls out packets made of newspaper , and short lengths of plastic tubing stoppered with slivers of wood . Each contains a small , rough diamond or two . He pours the contents of several packets into small bowls  --  the best of his stock . They are rough , and their color and clarity are probably terrible , but they play with light in a supple way . Here , living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , money , and power than it was about chasing spirits . <p> " There 're all sorts of nuts in the world , " Funch says as I examine a bala , or spherical rough diamond , about the size of a pea . " But here it 's kind of a romantic life . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Ecologist Roy Funch hikes up the bed of a waterfall to a diamond mining camp .
