From findings obtained in a previous research project on school and nursing service managers ' ability to hold their own , it was found that there are significant differences between these groups of managers with respect to their coping ability amidst daily demands . The coping ability of individuals can be influenced by many contributing factors , including their personal beliefs and the coping strategies that they use . Identifying predictors of school and nursing service managers ' coping ability was therefore considered important in meeting contemporary educational and health care challenges . Responding to this need , the aim of this research project was to explore these managers ' coping ability amidst daily demands by addressing the following issue : " To what extent is it possible to predict school and nursing service managers ' coping ability in terms of their personal beliefs and the coping strategies that they use ? " An empirical investigation was undertaken with reference to a conceptual framework . Consecutive factor analytical procedures , item analyses , and combinations of multivariate stepwise regression analyses were conducted on the data . The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal beliefs of the managers seem to contribute the most in predicting their perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands . <p> Key words coping ability ; predictors ; personal beliefs ; coping strategies ; empirical investigation ; multivariate linear regression analysis ; daily demands ; School and nursing service managers <p> Key words coping ability ; predictors ; personal beliefs ; coping strategies ; empirical investigation ; multivariate linear regression analysis ; daily demands ; School and nursing service managers Introduction : Research Problem and Aim <p> This research project is concerned with investigating the coping ability of South African school and nursing service managers amidst increasingly high daily demands and contemporary challenges . Both groups of managers find themselves in high stress professions . Burnard ( 1991:1 ) points out in this regard that the very fact of caring for others - in whatever capacity - implies that all professionals in a caring capacity are open to suffering from stress and stress-related problems . In addition , owing to political and social changes within the South African context and the influence of these changes on educational and health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed on most professionals in educational and health care fields , in particular on professionals in managerial positions . In fact , the contemporary managerial role of school and nursing service managers has increased dramatically because their roles became more difficult . <p> School managers ( principals ) are facing a specialist learning curve as their responsibilities in their schools take on the basic requirements of a small commercial business ( Ostell &; Oakland , 1995:68 ) . Principals are increasingly expected to manage school budgets and curriculum development , as well as the fears and situations which make their fellow teachers in the schools feel tense , frustrated or upset . Consequently , they find themselves in the dual position of being both a manager of people and of financial matters , which often makes high demands on their coping ability . This includes keeping in mind that success breeds success and earns money , whereas failure is automatically followed by a loss of resources . In accordance with Parikh ( 1991:xx ) school managers , like most managers in various fields , are now more extensively exposed to newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peak performance and leadership , which require a certain know-how , do-how and feel-how to enable them to hold their own successfully . These newly defined demands are also applicable with respect to nursing service managers . <p> Nursing service managers ' current role demands a full range of skills which include planning , assessing , appraising , budgeting , team building , leadership , monitoring and teaching ( Bowman , 1995:1 ) . Acquisition of these skills requires time , resources and opportunity . However , factors such staffing problems , lack of money , high workloads , few resources seem to inhibit staff development . Furthermore , nursing service managers have to deal with the inordinate pressures of coping with change . The tumultuous environment in which South Africa 's health care industry is , create new demands which potentially exceed individual resources ( Bowman , 1995:1 ) . These demands include demands with respect to affirmative action and transformation , as well as the need to bring about an improved service for patients by ensuring that every aspect of health care is provided locally and with due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . Within this environment , health care administrators , including nursing service managers , are particularly vulnerable and at risk from strain stimulated by new and complex stressors at work . This vulnerability was inter alia revealed by research findings obtained by Gmeiner &; Poggenpoel ( 1996:55-60 ) which indicated that nursing service managers experience difficulties in their relationships with diverse others , lack of or insufficient group acceptance/support , value conflicts , and difficulty with self-acceptance . <p> Against this background , it is hardly surprising that school and nursing service managers often have to struggle to cope successfully , both professionally and personally , amidst innumerable , sometimes diverse , tasks ( Myburgh , Niehaus &; Poggenpoel , 1999:36 ) . In fact , these managers are forced in a situation where they should increasingly make choices and decisions , often with far-reaching consequences . The problem is that they are not always sufficiently equipped to make carefully considered decisions in meeting situational demands . Travers and Cooper ( 1996:50 ) pointed out in this regard that individuals are often torn between job demands and their personal beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effective and creative performance of tasks depends on the extent to which individuals manage to cope successfully , both professionally and personally . <p> Unfortunately , the problem of school and nursing service managers being less successful in coping with contemporary challenges and demands is complex and not easily solved . These managers take the central position in their professional and personal circumstances , the context within which they have to hold their own . Managers ' ability to cope depends on all the variables functioning to a greater or lesser extent within this context . They are confronted daily with the task of dealing responsibly with a myriad demands in work and other contexts and of using opportunities . At the same time , these managers also attempt to satisfy their own needs and achieve their aspirations . It follows that there is a continuous interplay between demands emanating from the environment and the self of the manager . Travers and Cooper ( 1996:50 ) pointed out in this regard that individuals are often torn between job demands and their personal beliefs . <p> There are , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability amidst daily demands , including their personal beliefs , and the coping strategies that they use . In fact , from findings obtained in a previous research project , it was found that school and nursing service managers ' field of work ( profession ) seem to play a significant role with regard to their perceptions of coping ability . It follows that significant differences were identified between these groups of managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands ( Myburgh , Niehaus &; Poggenpoel , 1999:41-42 ) . Notwithstanding the significance and educational value of the above-mentioned findings , they do not advance an understanding of the role that contributing factors such as the managers ' personal beliefs and their use of coping strategies play with respect to their perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands . <p> Taking the above-mentioned exposition into consideration , it was considered important to identify predictors of school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst different daily demands . This information could lead to the planning of appropriate interventions aimed at equipping these managers to cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands . It is important for the physical and psychological health of managers that they are able to cope successfully , both personally and professionally . Cohen ( 1991:9 ) pointed out in this regard that the goal of improving the quality of life itself subsumes the achievement , maintenance , and enhancement of physical and psychological health . <p> Responding to the above-mentioned need , the aim of this research project was to explore and describe school and nursing service managers ' coping ability amidst daily demands by addressing the issue " To what extent is it possible to predict and explain school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their coping ability in terms of their personal beliefs and the coping strategies that they use ? " Research Strategy and Methodology <p> A quantitative , explorative , descriptive and contextual research strategy was utilised in order to obtain an understanding about how , if anything , personal beliefs and use of coping strategies contribute in predicting and explaining school and nursing service managers perceptions of their coping ability with respect to daily demands . This research strategy entailed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study was conducted to develop a conceptual framework with respect to school and nursing service managers ' coping ability amidst daily demands . <p>  --  An empirical investigation was then undertaken with reference to the abovementioned conceptual framework of reference to determine whether personal beliefs and the use of particular types of coping strategies of school and nursing service managers either individually or combined , enhance or inhibit their perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands . <p> The purpose of this article is to describe the research results obtained in this manner and to point out ensuing implications , as well as educational and health care directives . School and Nursing Service Managers ' Coping Ability <p> Within the context of the research undertaken and in accordance with Niehaus ( 1994:17 ) , Wilson and Kneisl ( 1996:6-7 ) and UNM SHC Health Education ( 1998:12 ) , the coping ability of a person is described as having the means to maintain , acknowledge , protect and enrich his/her inner self , with all the meanings he/she attaches to it - in work context and in all situations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . This coping ability of an individual is revealed by his/her behaviour . It refers to changes in the person 's ways of thinking , feeling and behaving to meet challenges such as contextual demands , as well as personal needs , aspirations and , goals ( Myburgh , Niehaus &; Poggenpoel , 1999 : 37 ) . Attempting to deal with these demands , school and nursing service managers consequently make use of particular coping strategies by which their ability to cope is expressed . Parikh ( 1991:7 ) states in this regard that individuals need to consciously reflect on , sort out , and take positions on the why , what and how of their lives in order to create attunement within themselves , as well as among other individuals and thereby coping successfully . <p> However , how people perceive and respond to daily demands and challenges varies widely among individuals . Every individual 's interpretation of , and attribution of meaning to , events are unique . Perception refers to the process during which a person selects , arranges and interprets his/her observations , thereby building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Niehaus , 1998:16 ) . Every individual 's interpretation of , and attribution of meaning to , events are unique . What one person experiences as a threat , another could see as a challenge ( O'Connor &; Clarke , 1990:44 ) . Reality lies not in the event , but in an individual 's perceptions of the event . This statement is confirmed by findings obtained by Myburgh , Niehaus &; Poggenpoel ( 1999:41-42 ) which inter alia indicated that school and nursing service managers find it relatively easy to cope with multiple role demands made on them . In fact , it was found that school managers , to a significantly larger extent than nursing service managers , perceive themselves capable to deal with these demands . Concerning interpersonal demands , nursing service managers have significantly more positive perceptions of their coping ability than school managers do . However , it was quite clear that both groups of managers do not quite perceive themselves capable enough to deal with demands arising from professional and personal relationships . <p> Taking the abovementioned findings into account , it seems clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coping ability varies with respect to different types of daily demands . However , the question remains whether role-playing factors such as school and nursing service managers ' personal beliefs and their use of particular types of coping strategies , either individually or combined , contribute to them having the abovementioned varying perceptions ? To answer this question , school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their coping ability with respect to specific daily demands are proposed as outcome measures to be studied as a function of or in relationship to role-playing factors such as personal beliefs and use of coping strategies . This means an investigation of the continuous activity that involves the functioning of the managers ' self , and is affected by inner purposes and external influences and which is expressed by the perceptions they arrive at of their coping ability with respect to specific daily demands . The relevance of personal beliefs and use of coping strategies as role-playing factors which could influence school and nursing service managers ' coping ability will be discussed subsequently . Role-Playing Factors Which Could Influence Managers ' Perceptions of Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many factors which could influence school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their ability to cope with daily demands , including their personal beliefs and their use of coping strategies . <p> Personal beliefs <p> Taking into consideration that beliefs about one 's self are at the basis of a human being 's approach to situations in life ( Atwater , 1979:151 ) , the goals individuals seek , the things they do , the judgements they make , even the experiments they are willing to try , are determined by their beliefs . In fact , as documented by Folkman ( 1984:840 ) , beliefs could be regarded as the pre-existing notions a person has about reality , serving as a perceptual lens and determining how the person sees him-/herself and the world in which he/she lives . Beliefs are , therefore , the products of an individual 's personal discovery of meaning . Combs , Avila and Purkey ( 1971:8 ) stated in this regard that what a person believes to be important , inevitably determines the methods he/she uses in dealing with people ; beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , the beliefs school and nursing service managers have about themselves are proposed to influence and contribute in the prediction and explanation of their perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands . <p> Coping strategies <p> Within the context of the research undertaken , coping strategies refer to cognitive skills and forms of behaviour by means of which individuals give expression to their capacity for coping in situations that involve tension , frustration or agitation on their part ( Niehaus , 1994:36-38 ) . School and nursing service managers ' abilities to cope are , in other words , reflected in the way in which they act . Niehaus ( 1994:77 ) distinguished between three types of coping strategies ; that is , problem-oriented , meaning-oriented and emotion-oriented coping strategies . Firstly , by actively trying to manage or solve problems , managers cope by using problem-oriented strategies . These coping strategies are aimed at averting emotional experiences such as tension , frustration and alarm . Secondly , managers could hold their own by using meaning-oriented strategies aimed at cognitively changing or neutralizing their perceptions and value-orientations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to understand the problem and to assess the implications of the event . Finally , managers could cope by trying to control and even reduce emotions that have already been aroused in them , in other words , using emotion-oriented coping strategies . A person 's endeavours to hold his/her own is , however , a shifting process in which the person must , at certain times , rely more heavily on the use of particular strategies , and at other times on other strategies , as the status of the situation changes . Furthermore , it is also possible that a combination of these types of strategies or techniques could be used to deal with certain events , particularly stressful ones . <p> Taking this into consideration , the strategies school and nursing service managers use to cope with daily demands are proposed to influence and contribute in the prediction and explanation of their perceptions of their coping ability . Empirical Investigation <p> An empirical investigation was undertaken with reference to a conceptual framework to explore and describe school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their coping ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategies they use in their efforts to hold their own . <p> Research instrument <p> A structured questionnaire was developed to obtain information from school and nursing service managers about their beliefs about themselves ( 15 items ) , their perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands ( 33 items ) and their use of different types of strategies ( 22 items ) in their efforts to cope . <p> Research group <p> The research group comprised a captive audience of school and nursing service managers , enrolled for a distance teaching diploma course in Educational Management at the Rand Afrikaans University . When attending one of the four annual contact sessions , the school and nursing service managers were requested to complete the aforementioned questionnaire . Participation in the investigation was optional . A total number of 323 school managers and 174 nursing service managers completed the questionnaire . Validity and Reliability of Research Instrument <p> As far as the content validity of the research instrument is concerned , experts in the field of education evaluated the different items in terms of their potential contribution towards realising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of a theoretical framework which was developed by means of a comprehensive literature study . <p> Construct validity and reliability of the personal beliefs , perceptions of coping ability and coping strategies scales were investigated separately by respectively applying factor-analytical procedures consisting of a principal component analysis and a principal factor analysis , with orthogonal axes and varimax rotation , as well as item analyses on the data . On the basis of the results of the statistical analyses and theoretical considerations , the factors in table 1 are considered to be valid and reliable . It follows that each of these groups of factors seems to constitute a separate dimension of school and nursing service managers ' coping ability . Analytical Procedure <p> What , if anything , about school and nursing service managers ' personal beliefs and coping strategies represents favourable of unfavourable conditions for their perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands , and how do these conditions exercise their influence ? What roles do personal beliefs and coping strategies play in managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst different types of daily demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regression analyses to the data obtained during the empirical investigation . These analyses were used to assess the relative importance of school and nursing service managers ' personal beliefs and their coping strategies respectively in accounting for the changes ( variance ) in their perceptions of their coping ability amidst different types of daily demands . In fact , multiple regression analyses is used whenever a dependent variable is to be studied as a function of , or in relationship to , any research factors of interest ( expressed as independent variables ) ( Cohen and Cohen , 1983:3 ) . Separate regression models were constructed with respect to the total group of managers , and the groups of school and nursing service managers . <p> In identifying dependent and independent variables for constructing relevant regression models for predicting and explaining the different groups of managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands , it was kept in mind that multi-collinearity should be counteracted as far as possible . Stevens ( 1986:62 ) pointed out that multi-collinearity , which occurs when two variables in a matrix are perfectly ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to multiple regression analysis . The reason is that the size of the multiple regression coefficients is severely limited and determining the importance of a given predictor is limited because the effects of the predictors are confounded due to the high correlation among them . <p> In an endeavour to counteract multi-collinearity and with reference to the theoretical framework , the abovementioned results of factor-analytical procedures and item analyses were used for purposes of constructing the relevant regression models . It follows that an orthogonal solution from the factor-analytical procedures implies that the relevant identified factors are fitted perpendicular with respect to one another , resulting in low intercorrelations between the various factors ( Chatterjee and Price , 1977:157-163 ; Tacq , n.d:21 e.f . ) . <p> For purposes of this research project the following dependent variables were selected for constructing relevant regression models : managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst respectively multiple role demands and interpersonal demands . These two dependent variables were selected taking into account that findings obtained in a previous research project ( Myburgh , Niehaus &; Poggenpoel , 1999 : 41-42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nursing service managers differ significantly . The following three sets of independent variables ( predictor/explanatory variables ) were identified for purposes of constructing eighteen separate regression models : <p>  --  Set one , comprising three types of personal beliefs <p>  --  Set two , comprising two types of coping strategies <p>  --  Set three , comprising a combination of three types of personal beliefs and two types of coping strategies <p> The stepwise variable selection technique was used to select independent variables for constructing each regression model . Managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst different types of daily demands were then regressed separately on each of the abovementioned sets of variables . These analyses were done to arrive at the following : <p>  --  Identifying predictors of managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst respectively multiple role demands and interpersonal demands . These predictors were indicated by statistically significant regression coefficients ( B ) . <p>  --  Obtaining an indication of the strength of the correlation ( linear relationship ) between managers ' perceptions of their coping ability and the combined effect of the predictors which ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>  --  Obtaining an indication of the proportion of the variation ( changes ) in managers ' perceptions of their coping ability that is explained by the predictors in a multiple linear regression . This is measured by the coefficient of multiple determination , namely the squared multiple correlation coefficient ( R ) . <p>  --  Assessing the unique effect and relative importance of each predictor with respect to the relationship between managers ' perceptions of their coping ability and the set of predictors . This was done by examining the relative contribution of each predictor to the explained variance ( changes in managers ' perceptions of their coping ability ) ( R ) . <p>  --  Examining the degree to which the predictor individually correlates with a specific dependent variable ( r ) , contributed towards providing further clarification about the significant role that the predictor plays in explaining managers ' perceptions of their coping ability . <p> The results obtained in this regard will be addressed next . Predicting and Explaining Managers ' Perceptions of Their Coping Ability <p> Do personal beliefs and use of coping strategies contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their capability to deal with different types of daily demands ? Could school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst daily demands be predicted and explained in terms of their personal beliefs and the coping strategies that they use ? <p> An explorative overview of the findings <p> The personal beliefs and use of coping strategies independently and jointly contribute in predicting and explaining school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst respectively multiple role demands and interpersonal demands . <p> Comparing the separate contributions of personal beliefs and coping strategies , it seems clear that the personal beliefs of managers make the largest contributions towards predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst different daily demands . <p>  --  The combined effect of the relevant personal beliefs of school and nursing service managers ' , in particular those of school managers accounts for more than 40% of the variations in their perceptions of their capability to deal with multiple role demands ( R=0,427 , R =0,426 ) . It follows that school managers ' beliefs about themselves play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their perceptions of their ability to deal with interpersonal demands than nursing service managers ' personal beliefs <p>  --  The proportion of variation in school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their capability to deal with interpersonal demands that can be explained by their personal beliefs , is respectively 19,8% and 35,5% ( R=0,198 ; R=0,355 ) . It therefore seems clear that nursing service managers ' beliefs about themselves have , in particular , a much greater influence on their perceptions of their ability to deal with interpersonal demands than school managers ' personal beliefs . <p> However , it is evident from the results that managers ' use of coping strategies can not be ignored when efforts are made to predict and explain their perceptions of their coping ability amidst different daily demands , in particular , those of nursing service managers . <p>  --  The proportion of variation in school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their capability to deal with multiple role demands that can be explained by their use of coping strategies , is respectively 26,3% and 33,4% . <p>  --  The proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their ability to cope with interpersonal demands that can be explained by their use of coping strategies , ranges from 10,9% to 26,1% ( R=0,164 ; R=0,109 ; R=0,261 ) . <p> It follows that nursing service managers ' use of coping strategies play a more significant role than those of school managers in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their capability to deal with different daily demands . <p> Taking these findings into consideration , it seems clear that differentiated profiles of school and nursing service managers , reveal more about the roles that personal beliefs and use of coping strategies of each group of managers play with respect to their perceptions of their capability in dealing with different daily demands . <p> Exploring the joint contribution of personal beliefs and coping strategies , it is evident that managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst different daily demands seem to be best predicted and explained when a combination of these role-playing factors are included in the relevant regression models . This statement is made taking into consideration that the stepwise variable selection method eliminated the following variables from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play significant roles in predicting the managers ' perceptions about their coping ability : <p>  --  Nursing service managers ' beliefs about their professional and personal coping ability it follows that the extent to which nursing service managers believe that they have the necessary life skills , knowledge and experience to cope effectively with daily demands , do not after all seem to play a significant role in predicting and explaining their perceptions about their coping ability amidst multiple role demands . <p>  --  School managers ' use of effective coping strategies follows that school managers ' use effective coping strategies , aimed at addressing the causes of emotional experiences such as tension , frustration or agitation , do not after all seem to play a significant role in predicting and explaining their perceptions about their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands . <p>  --  Nursing service managers ' beliefs about their professional status and competence . It follows that nursing service managers ' perceptions of their capability to deal with interpersonal demands do not seem to be significantly influenced by the extent to which nursing service managers believe that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they succeed in maintaining a balance between the realisation of their personal needs and those of their staff and that they ate proud to be health care workers . <p> Further clarification about the results which were obtained by including a combination of(all) the independent variables in the relevant regression equations . <p> Managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst multiple role demands in terms of their personal beliefs and use of coping strategies <p> The findings in indicate that both groups of managers ' beliefs about their personal competence ( B1 ) , in particular those of nursing service managers , could be regarded as the single most important role-playing factor in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst multiple role demands . These beliefs contribute respectively 31,7% and 40% ( Rp=0,317 ; R=0,400 ) to the explained variance ( 45 , 2% : R=0,452 ; 46,1% : R=0,461 ) in the different groups of managers ' perceptions of their ability to deal with multiple role demands . In fact , managers who strongly believe that they are realising personal objectives , who believe that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in control of their job obligations , deal effectively with multiple role demands ( r=0,563 ; r=0,633 ) . <p> In addition to the above-mentioned beliefs , school managers ' beliefs about respectively their professional status and competence ( B2 ) and their professional and personal coping ability ( B3 ) jointly make a significant contribution ( 10 , 1% ) in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst multiple role demands ( R=0,091+ 0,010=0,101 ) . School managers who have strong beliefs in this regard , deal effectively with multiple role demands ( r=0,549 ; r=0,439 ) . It is particularly noticeable that these beliefs of nursing service managers do not seem to contribute in predicting their perceptions about their coping ability amidst multiple role demands . This statement is made bearing in mind that the stepwise variable selection method eliminated both these belief variables ( B2 and B3 ) from the full regression model for nursing service managers . In fact , the personal beliefs of school managers jointly have a slightly greater influence ( 41 , 8% ) on their perceptions of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers ' personal beliefs ( 40% ) ( R=0,317+0,091 + 0,010=0,418 ; R=0,400 ) . <p> Further clarification about the abovementioned perceptions of both groups of managers , in particular those of nursing service managers , is provided by their use of effective coping strategies ( SI ) . School and nursing service managers ' use of this type of coping strategies adds respectively a further 3,3% and 6,1% ( R=0,033 ; R=0,061 ) to the explained variance ( 45 , 2% : R=0,452 ; 46,1% : R=0,461 ) in their perceptions of their coping ability amidst multiple role demands . In fact , managers who find themselves capable to cope with multiple role demands , frequently use effective coping strategies which are aimed at addressing the causes of emotional experiences such as tension , frustration or agitation ( r=0,506 ; r=0,578 ) . Moreover , it is particularly noticeable that the different groups of managers ' use of less effective coping strategies ( S2 ) does not seem to play a significant role with respect to their perceptions of their capability to deal with multiple role demands . This statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method eliminated less effective coping strategies from the regression models for the different groups of managers . These coping strategies are principally aimed at addressing emotional experiences such as tension , frustration or agitation which add to managers ' ability to maintain their emotional equilibrium . <p> Managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands in terms of their personal beliefs and use of coping strategies <p> The results in suggest that both groups of managers ' beliefs about their personal competence ( B1 ) , in particular those of nursing service managers , could be regarded as the single most important role-playing factor in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands . These beliefs contribute respectively 17,1% and 31,6% ( R=0,171 ; R=0,316 ) to the explained variance ( 22 , 4% : R=0,224 ; 36,3% : R=0,363 ) in school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their ability to deal with interpersonal demands . ( R=0,171 ; R=0,316 ) . Managers who believe that they are realising personal objectives , succeed in realising their own potential and are in control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpersonal demands r =0,414 ; r = 0,562 ) . <p> In addition to the above-mentioned beliefs , school managers ' beliefs about their professional status and competence ( B2 ) make a relatively small contribution ( 3 , 1% ) in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands ( table 3 , phase 3 : R=0,031 ) . Bearing in mind that the stepwise variable selection method eliminated this belief variable ( B2 ) from the full regression model for nursing service managers , it is evident that these beliefs of nursing service managers do not seem to contribute in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst these demands . <p> Furthermore , it is particularly noticeable that both groups of managers ' beliefs about their professional and personal coping ability ( B3 ) do not seem to contribute in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands . This statement is made taking into consideration that the stepwise variable selection method eliminated less this belief variable from the regression models for the different groups of managers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service managers believe that they have the necessary life skills , knowledge and experience to cope effectively with daily demands , do not seem to play a significant role in predicting and explaining their perceptions about their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands . <p> Moreover , different types of coping strategies play significant roles with respect to the different groups of managers ' perceptions of their capability to deal with interpersonal demands . School managers ' use of less effective coping strategies ( S2 : R =0,023 ) and nursing service managers ' use of effective coping strategies ( S1 : R =0,047 ) contribute respectively in predicting their perceptions of their coping ability amidst these demands . In fact , school managers who frequently use less effective coping strategies , and nursing service managers who frequently use effective coping strategies , to a large extent perceive themselves capable to cope with interpersonal demands ( r=0,162 ; r=0,511 ) . This finding suggests that nursing service managers seem to cope more effectively with interpersonal demands as compared to school managers . This statement is made on the basis that the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with interpersonal demands . Effective coping strategies , which are predominantly problem-oriented coping strategies , include taking things one step at a time , engaging in a plan of action , and negotiating with those concerned to gain something positive from the events . Synthesis , Educational and Health Care Implications and Directives . <p> The research undertaken focussed on predicting and explaining school and nursing service managers ' perceptions of their coping ability in terms of their personal beliefs , their use of coping strategies and a combination of these research factors . This was done by conducting a series of eighteen separate stepwise multiple linear regressions to determine whether personal beliefs and use of coping strategies , either singly or combined , contribute towards predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst respectively multiple role demands and interpersonal demands . <p> Overall , the results of the regression analyses were consistent with the proposition that managers ' personal beliefs and their use of coping strategies contribute in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst different types of daily demands .

It follows from a previous research project that both groups of managers have positive perceptions about their coping ability amidst these demands . Moreover , school managers find it significantly easier than nursing service managers to cope with multiple role demands .

Personal beliefs provide the basis for great personal strength which enables managers to hold their own by actively trying to manage or solve problems ( Niehaus and Myburgh , 1997:173 ) . <p> Managers ' perceptions of their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands <p> Interpersonal demands include management of conflict with staff , as well as the disposition of their staff towards school and nursing service managers and , demands that colleagues and misunderstandings with them place on school and nursing service managers . It was found in a previous research project that nursing service managers find it significantly easier than school managers to cope with interpersonal demands do . However , both groups of managers have less positive perceptions about their coping ability amidst these demands . Further clarification in this regard is provided by the following findings : <p>  --  Concerning personal beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular , a greater influence on their perceptions of their ability to deal with interpersonal demands than school managers ' personal beliefs . In fact , both groups of managers ' beliefs about their personal competence ( B1 ) , in particular those of nursing service managers , could be regarded as the single most important role-playing factor in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands . <p>  --  As far as coping strategies are concerned , it is particularly noticeable that different types of coping strategies play significant roles with respect to the different groups of managers ' perceptions of their capability to deal with interpersonal demands . School managers ' use of less effective coping strategies ( S2 ) and nursing service managers ' use of effective coping strategies ( S1 ) contribute respectively in predicting their perceptions of their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands . It follows that nursing service managers seemingly cope more effectively with interpersonal demands than school managers , that is bearing in mind that the use of effective coping strategies is indicative of a greater ability to cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing service managers , in particular school managers , seem to have less positive perceptions about their ability to cope with interpersonal demands was provided by taking the following findings into consideration : <p>  --  Both groups of managers ' beliefs about their professional and personal coping ability ( B3 ) do not seem to contribute in predicting and explaining their perceptions of their coping ability amidst interpersonal demands . It follows that the extent to which school and nursing service managers believe that they have the necessary life skills , knowledge and experience to cope effectively with daily demands , do not seem play a significant role in predicting and explaining their perceptions about their coping ability amidst multiple role demands . <p>  --  School managers using less effective coping strategies frequently when they seemingly find it easy to deal with interpersonal demands , suggest that school managers ' perceptions of their coping ability with respect to interpersonal demands may not be so realistic . In fact , using less effective coping strategies , indicates that school managers ' experience crises in their ability to hold their own with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils , the dispositions of staff and pupils towards school managers and demands that colleagues and misunderstandings with them make on school managers . This happens because less effective coping strategies are considered to be reactive and are usually used when emotional experiences such as tension , frustration or agitation have already been elicited in a person and he/she endeavours to control it . Combs ( 1965:12 ) pointed out in this regard that behaviour is a direct result of the individual 's perceptions of him/herself , his/her perceptions of the situations in which he/she finds him-/herself and the relationship between these perceptions . Alternatively , school managers might have been reluctant to admit that they sometimes find it difficult to deal with interpersonal demands . <p> Against this background the question of how school and nursing service managers could be empowered to cope successfully remains . <p> Educational and health care implications and directives <p> Based on the findings obtained and in accordance with Combs ( 1982:170-176 ) , Travers and Cooper ( 1996:174 ) and Myburgh , Niehaus &; Poggenpoel ( 1999:43-44 ) , it seems clear that school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the job , but also to stay in the job or be in the job without detriment to the individual . In empowering school and nursing service managers to cope successfully amidst daily demands , in-service education ( training ) programmes , workshops and even stress management interventions should , therefore , include the following : <p>  --  Opportunities during which conflict management , communication and other interpersonal skills of principals could be developed and refined . <p>  --  Opportunities during which school and nursing service managers ' concepts of themselves , their status as managers and care-givers and their concepts of their jobs could be developed . Bearing in mind that the behaviour of individuals is largely determined by their self-concepts ( Combs , 1982:159 ) , experiences should therefore be designed to help school and nursing service managers see themselves as adequate , capable and effective people . What they believe about themselves affect every aspect of their professional and personal lives . <p>  --  Opportunities during which relevant skills of school and nursing service managers for managing different and diverse roles , including time management skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) school and nursing service managers ' professional lives and their lives outside work context are interwoven to a greater extent . Higher demands for productivity and time are made on these groups of managers . School and nursing service managers thus increasingly need to be able to identify priority areas in their lives and manage their time accordingly . Providing school and nursing service managers with opportunities during which they examine their current time management problems , might help them gain perspective on the way pressure affects them and , thus , enable them to manage it effectively . <p>  --  Opportunities during which managerial skills of school and nursing service managers could be developed and their knowledge of managerial aspects could be upgraded and expanded . <p> The following statement made by a staff member with respect to her manager , as reported by Travers and Cooper ( 1996:175 ) , underlines the importance of empowering managers to cope successfully with daily demands : " Good management makes a tremendous difference . My current head is well organised , is a good communicator , has a lot of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seriously . In my experience there are many heads without these skills and qualities . They seriously affect their staff ... " <p>
