<p> NEW Westside girls basketball coach Troy Gillespie entered the 2005-06 season with high expectations . The Wolves debuted at No. 1 in the area in the Houston Chronicle 's preseason rankings and were rated No. 4 in the state in the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches poll . <p> But Gillespie , who replaced former coach Alaina Turner after three seasons as her varsity assistant , said his team was n't fazed at all . <p> " The ( top ) ranking is nice , but it 's unsubstantiated , " Gillespie said . <p> " Of course , you want to be recognized , but our girls know that they have n't achieved anything yet . " <p> Still , it 's hard not to like Westside , which returns five starters and several other key players from last year 's 29-5 squad . The Wolves are loaded with talent , with a handful of possible college prospects . <p> Gillespie quipped that Westside 's lone weakness is coaching . <p> " I 'm sure it raised a few eyebrows when I was named coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm relatively young and have never been a head coach before . But I 'm grateful for the opportunity . " <p> Westside was the top seed at last week 's Houston ISD Girls Basketball Tournament , but Gillespie said the Wolves did n't always act like it . <p> Westside trailed in several of its games , but the Wolves still managed to claim the tournament crown with a 52-42 victory over Westbury Christian in the championship game . <p> " We did n't play well in the first half in a few games , but we always found a way to win , " Gillespie said . " There were some good teams in this tournament . We 're really excited to win it . " <p> Sydney Colson , the tournament 's most valuable player , scored 17 points against Westbury Christian . Deziree Green added 12 points and Ashley Alexander nine . <p> In the semifinals , Westside ran into District 21-5A rival Bellaire . The Wolves staged another comeback to eke out a 63-48 victory . <p> " It was much closer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back at the end of the third quarter and hit some free throws late in the game . <p> " Bellaire 's got a good , young team . They made us play hard . " <p> Colson delivered 22 points and Alexander 16 for Westside . <p> The Wolves also held off Willowridge 61-54 in the quarterfinals , their second win over the Eagles in just over a week . <p> In other tournament games , Westside beat Lee 67-13 and Fort Bend Marshall 69-58 . <p> Gillespie said Westside survived one of its most grueling stretches in recent memory to go 5-0 in the tourney and extend its season mark to 10-1 . <p> " We only played six games in all of November and five in the tournament , " Gillespie said . " We were n't able to practice much and it showed . But I could see a lot of improvement during our ( tournament ) games . " <p> Earlier in the week , Westside eased past Lamar 59-41 in a District 21-5A game , thanks to 15 points from Colson . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday . Westside draws Port Arthur Memorial at 4 p.m. today at Eisenhower . <p> Gillespie said Westside is the defending tourney champ , but he feels the Wolves will face a daunting challenge to repeat . <p> The experts tabbed Westside as the early favorite in District 21-5A - a league that features such heavyweights as Madison and Bellaire . Gillespie , for one , is n't taking anything for granted . <p> " You 've got two of the best coaches around in ( Madison 's ) Anthony Fields and ( Bellaire 's ) Mike Kramer , " said Gillespie . " Even though everyone is picking us , I would n't count out Madison and Bellaire . " <p> Although Westside claimed a share of the league title two years ago , Gillespie pointed out that the Wolves have never won an outright championship in the school 's history . <p> Thanks to a cast of veterans and several gifted newcomers though , it could be Westside 's year . <p> Green , a 5-foot-10 senior , will lead a balanced team from her guard spot . Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve on the 14 points and eight rebounds she averaged last season . <p> Gillespie said Green , who tallied 20 points in a 68-60 loss to Cy-Fair in the opener , has bounced back since a knee injury her sophomore season . <p> " Deziree is back to where she was before the injury , " Gillespie said . " She is an amazing shooter . She 's tremendously athletic . She also has leadership skills . Deziree plays the game with a lot of intensity . " <p> Alexander , a 6-1 senior , and Sonja Thompson , a 5-10 junior , return at the post positions , where they will give the Wolves an intimidating inside presence . <p> Gillespie expects Alexander , who averaged nine points and eight rebounds , to give the Wolves a double double each night . <p> " Ashley is a little on the thin side , but she plays big , " Gillespie said . " She 's still growing . Her best basketball is ahead of her when she 's in college . " <p> Thompson , whose father , Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superb athlete who can dominate at times . <p> " Sonja has only been playing basketball for two or three years , " Gillespie said . " She is still learning how to play , but she comes from a family of athletes . She 's got great potential . " <p> While Green , Alexander and Thompson are all big-time players , Westside 's most visible player is Colson . The 5-foot-7 junior is the Chronicle 's Preseason Player of the Year after averaging 16 points , eight assists and four steals per game . <p> Gillespie said no less than 20 Division I college programs have expressed interest in Colson , the Wolves ' play-making point guard . <p> " Sydney is the finest high school basketball player I 've seen , " Gillespie said . " She has the desire . She 's just as competitive on the practice court as she is during the game . She 's a born leader . She 's something else . " <p> But Gillespie said those are n't even Colson 's best attributes . <p> " What makes Sydney so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is just a down-to-earth , 16-year-old girl who can play basketball . " <p> Other possible starters include Cinnamon Kava , a 5-6 senior , at guard or Jasmine Smith , a 5-8 senior , at guard-forward . Gillespie said Kava might be the best shooter on the roster . <p> " Cinnamon made 42 percent of her 3-point shots last year , " Gillespie said . " She has dead-eye range . " <p> Meanwhile , Smith has proven to be a steady performer for the Wolves . She tallied 15 points in Westside 's 87-9 romp over Lee last week . <p> " Jasmine can plays spots 1 to 5 , " Gillespie said . " She can do it all , which gives us a few more options . " <p> Top reserves for Westside include Ausha Hartley , a 5-6 junior , and Alysha Adams , a 5-5 junior , at guard . Hartley chipped in 14 points against Lee . <p> Gillespie said Hartley , like Green , has recovered from a knee injury and is running well . <p> " Ausha is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is great driving to the basketball . " <p> Adams , the twin sister of Westside football standout Alonzo Adams , is another excellent athlete who excelled in volleyball . <p> " Alysha has the vertical leap , " Gillespie said . " She can jump out the gym . " <p> Lavette Jackson , a 5-5 junior , is in the guard rotation . Other role players include Nakesha Antalan , a 5-0 senior , at point guard and Ewune Ewane , a 5-9 senior , at forward/post . <p> Gillespie said the next few months should be exciting for the Wolves . He feels his team can handle the pressure . <p> " Everyone expects us to be good . So do I , " Gillespie said . " The best thing about these girls is they are better people than they are athletes . They work hard every day in the gym . They 're willing to do the little things you need to be successful .
