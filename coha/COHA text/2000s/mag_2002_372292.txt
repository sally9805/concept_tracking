A study of the running ability of Tyrannosaurus Rex , reported last week in the journal Nature , suggests that the king of the prehistoric jungle was n't quite the speedster we once thought . Researchers found that T. rex ( as imagined in an early 20th century painting , left , by Charles Knight ) was too massive to sprint like the giant-size cheetah it appears to be in movies . This is just the latest in a series of humbling revisions made over the past decade or so , as new fossils were unearthed and old ones re-examined . But one thing has n't changed : this 42-ft. - long , 14,000-lb. toothy predator would still have been plenty scary .  --  By Andrea Dorfman and Roy B. White <P>  --  NEW POSTURE The classic images of T. rex showed him standing upright , with tail near the ground for stability . The correct posture is shown in this skeleton from Chicago 's Field Museum : the beast balanced its weight over its hips like a seesaw . <P>  --  THE SMELL OF THE KILL Studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of smell , a key weapon in tracking prey . The dinosaur 's nostrils have been repositioned as well : closer to the end of its snout rather than its eyes . <P>  --  NO GAZELLE A new biomechanical study , validated in living chickens and alligators , shows that T. rex 's muscle mass would allow it to run only 25 m.p.h. , not the 45 m.p.h. previously estimated . And the mighty hunter , it turns out , may have also been a scavenger . <P>  --  FEATHERED FOE Most scientists now believe T. rex and its close relatives , like this coelurosaur , were more closely related to birds than to other dinosaurs . Juveniles may have had feather-like coats ( like chicks ) that they shed as adults .
