Section : In review TABLE <p> ONCE YOU GET hooked on W. G. Sebald 's work it is hard not to regard most other literature as frivolous . He is , however , an acquired taste , like single-malt scotch . The first words of his complex and heavy prose are hard to swallow , but even if you have to grimace as the words go down , you will find that nothing else tastes quite the same . Moreover , if you read too many of his novels at a time , rich in language but deficient in plot , they may leave you a bit disoriented . They will also leave a very lasting impression . <p> Sebald is the great anti-Proust of the 20th century . Proust paid tribute to the aristocrats who had been erased from history by World War I. As a young man he had wanted to join their world , and as a writer he knew he had to reconstruct that world in order to have any chance for self-understanding . Because he does not idealize the past , his aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past can never be repeated , but he also knows that , as a general rule , the person we once were is infinitely more interesting than the person we have become . <p> For Sebald , who was born in Germany but spent all of his professional life teaching in England , the past is a burden , not a calling . Proust memorializes a lost world of aristocrats whose charms come from the graceful way they dissipate their fortunes . Sebald is haunted by a nation that set about systematically destroying much of the world , including itself . While Proust both loves and ridicules the aristocracy , Sebald 's somber tone leaves you with no doubt about his essentially moral perspective . Sebald 's characters are lost in the present because they have had their pasts taken from them . His books are full of long monologues by narrators steeped in sadness and estrangement . Writing before the ' Holocaust , Proust thought that if we could only recover the past , it could redeem us . Sebald 's characters live in a past that is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For Proust , memory promises a realized eschatology . Sebald 's prose , by contrast , sustains a realized apocalypse . The destructive forces of the past have made us survivors , and the only way to keep living is by clinging to the very past that has almost destroyed us . The way Sebald 's stories move toward loss almost seems , to anticipate his own tragic death in a car crash in December 2001 . Four of his novels had been translated into English when he died . He was 57 . <p> In 1997 Sebald presented a series of lectures in Zurich on World War II air raids against Germany . The lectures were published in Germany in 1999 , but Sebald did not live to guide the English edition into print . His absence does not make his voice any less powerful . Born in 1944 and growing up in a village in the Alps , Sebald had no personal experience of the fire bombings . Nevertheless , his exile 's sense of being denied a past is readymade for reflecting on the destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for the willed amnesia many Germans affected after the war . In this book he wonders why the raids made such a scant impact on the German literary imagination . Germans look away when confronted by their past . Why has n't their national humiliation found a voice ? <p> That his question is primarily aesthetic does not mean that it lacks a moral dimension . Sebald admits that Germans could not question the bombing campaign after the war , since they had killed millions more themselves . He also acknowledges the desperation of the situation in England . Nevertheless , he portrays the bombings as a madness prolonged by its own momentum . Meant to break the morale of the Germans , the bombings , Sebald suspects , accomplished nothing except to lift the spirits of the English . For Sebald , indiscriminately dropping 1 million tons of bombs on enemy territory , " on a scale without historical precedent , " was a high price to pay for a much needed propaganda victory . <p> The Germans faced the bombing campaign with silent fascination . Sebald is drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from survivors and the few attempts at artistic representation by novelists . His own - depiction of the horrors is respectful and economical , but his graphic images are enough to suggest the paralyzing damage done to the memories of the survivors . Only a writer this sensitive to the entanglements of memory could begin to do justice to this immemorial event . <p> Sebald is attentive to the irony that the postwar economic miracle was made possible by the capacity of Germans to avert their gaze . Many Germans interpreted the destruction as a just punishment , an act of God , and it is true that by cutting the Germans off from their past the Allies forced them to rebuild for a better future . It is a further irony that it took the American war against Iraq to give the Germans a reason for retrieving their memories of the Allied campaign . The ease with which those memories were used to promote a politicized antiwar agenda  --  the American bombing of Iraq was , after all , nothing like the Allied bombing of Germany  --  suggests that Germany might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its past . <p> America has its own problem with memory , of course . Perhaps nowhere is that made more painfully clear than in James Dickey 's 1965 poem " The Firebombing . " The narrator reflects on his inability to feel guilty about participating in the napalming of Tokyo-20 years earlier . Surveying his suburban existence , he tries to imagine the destruction he triggered . He imagines one of his bombs that " finds a home and clings to it like a child . " Yet try as he might , he is " still 20 years overweight , still unable / To get down there to see / What really happened . " He would like to extend an invitation to his victims  --  " As though to the neighbor/I borrowed the hedge-clippers from "  --  to come into his home , but he ca n't . The deed is done , and he does not really regret it . <p> Although the poem is about Tokyo , it could just as well be about any German city . America could not celebrate this fateful deed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German literature that Sebald analyzes , however , this poem does not flinch from demonstrating both the horror of war and the usefulness of amnesia . <p> Reviewed by Steven Webb <p> <p> Steven Webb , who teaches at Wabash College in Crawfordsville , Indiana . <p>
