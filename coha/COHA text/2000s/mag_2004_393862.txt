With the release of the " antibrand " sneaker Blackspot , " antipreneur " Kalle Lasn is planning to stick it to Nike  --  including running ads with the obliterated Swoosh below <p> Like many entrepreneurs , Kalle Lasn has big ideas , and even bigger dreams . He talks about $100 million in sales , about cutting into the market share of giants , reinventing the whole idea of the corporation , inventing " a new kind of cool . " Entrepreneurs need chutzpah , but Lasn takes it to new levels because as he spoke one recent afternoon in his Vancouver office , he did n't even have a product . He did have an idea for a product , though , and a few weeks later worked out details that , he pledged , would put it on the market by October . The product is a sneaker , but in a funny way that 's almost incidental . It 's called the Blackspot , and Lasn 's ideas all revolve around this brand  --  or anti-brand . That distinction matters a great deal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name for himself as one of the most vocal opponents of the whole concept of branding , advertising , and marketing . The magazine he co-founded , Adbusters , is devoted to satirizing , criticizing , and flat-out attacking big corporations such as Nike , Philip Morris , ExxonMobil , and McDonald 's and their carefully crafted public images . <p> In 1999 , Lasn ( who pronounces his name , roughly , kol-lay lazzen ) published Culture Jam , a book that railed against the " mental pollution " of marketing , implicating a culture of media images and endless sales pitches for rising rates of depression , alcoholism , even suicide . He wrote that the book Silent Spring and other totems of environmental awareness " shocked us into realizing that our natural environment was dying , and catalyzed a wave of activism that changed the world . Now it 's time to do the same for our mental environment . " Proposed solutions involved " demarketing , " " subvertising ' and a " guerrilla information war . " <p> This does n't sound like someone whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here 's the thing about the guerrilla information war that Lasn and his rotating crew of two dozen or so employees at Adbusters were fighting : " We were losing ' he admits . While the Adbusters Media Foundation has built enough of an audience to keep it out of the red  --  the magazine sells for $7.95 an issue and has international circulation of 120,000 , according to Lasn  --  it has had little success getting its incendiary anti-ads into any mainstream venue . So rather than just attack Nike  --  although , as we 'll see , that 's still his obsession  --  Adbusters would produce a rival shoe of its own , with environmentally friendly materials and ethical labor . Like many a brand before it , Blackspot would be designed to stand for big ideas : in this case , socially minded entrepreneurialism and grass-roots capitalism . " And , of course , coming up with an antilogo , " Lasn proclaims , sounding excited , as he often does , " we 're moving from whining into action . " <p> Action has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has taken a long time . Moreover , Lasn has a habit of alienating people  --  and not just his rivals . One would-be partner has actually become a rival and has beaten Lasn into the marketplace with a different take on the antipreneurial sneaker . And even some Adbusters fans are n't sure that the whole notion of an anti-logo is n't just double talk for hypocrisy . <p> Still , the Blackspot idea is provocative , merging protest and rebellion with **27;6343;TOOLONG strategies . Often when a new brand or product is invented , its creators then make an effort to describe ( or invent ) its deeper meaning or Big Idea . Here the Big Idea came first , and it 's the product that 's being invented after the fact Lasn wants to merge the marketplace of goods into the marketplace of ideas : The question is whether the Blackspot will live up to Lasn 's lofty goals  --  or whether those goals will end up sounding like the empty rhetoric of yet another pitchman . <p> The plan for the sneaker was announced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions at Asian factories where much sneaker-making has been outsourced has quieted since the 1990s , but part of the point seemed to be to find a new way to apply pressure  --  and to offer consumers a chance to express their opinions through shopping . The proposed shoe was essentially a black Converse Chuck Taylor All Star low-top with its traditional logo replaced by a circular smudge and a black spot stamped on the sole as visual representation of the antibrand . The Chuck Taylor , the thinking goes , was a rebel sneaker , worn by the Ramones and fashion-rejecting punks . Last year Converse was bought by Nike , making the shoe an ideal symbolic target . " We want to do a kind of loose Converse knockoff , " Lasn says . It will look like that iconic sneaker at first glance but on closer inspection will have various " tweaks , " so that " suddenly you realize it 's something more than a Converse . " <p> The Adbusters Media Foundation has its headquarters in a five-story , 100-year-old house on a mostly residential block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of college co-op atmosphere , the place bustled with activity on a recent visit . The magazine 's creative director , Michael Simons , and " producer " Paul Shoebridge ( yes , Shoebridge ) are in charge of negotiating the various barriers that separate Lasn 's ambitious vision from messy reality . Shoebridge recalls thinking that the next step would be a simple matter of tracking down a list of acceptable factories and picking one . He worked the phones , talking to various rights monitors and so forth , and found that while plenty of organizations track problems , no one seemed to be keeping tabs ' on who  --  if anyone  --  was doing it right . <p> Meanwhile , on the other side of North America , Adam Neiman was intrigued . Neiman is president and co-founder of No Sweat Apparel , in West Newton , Mass. , which sells a variety of clothing  --  T-shirts , jeans , yoga pants  --  that it pledges are " 100% union-made . " In the Blackspot , he saw an opportunity to link the " anarchista aesthetes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No Sweat courts . He called Lasn and offered to handle the production-sourcing issues in exchange for co-promotion  --  because , he says , " Kalle 's a great promoter . " <p> According to Neiman , Lasn was interested but with the notable caveat that he did n't want a formal contract . No Sweat had a line on a factory in Indonesia and worked with a nongovernmental organization that interviewed its workers  --  but Neiman did n't want to give Lasn the details until he had more of a commitment . " And he said , ' I do n't think we 're going to do anything with you at al , " ' Neiman says . Lasn 's version of this is both less specific and less diplomatic " We told them to f  --  off , ' he recalls breezily . <p> And that was that  --  until Neiman saw an article that quoted Lasn bashing the antisweatshop movement as handwringers and whiners . " I blew my stack , " says Neiman . " I was just furious . And I said , ' F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' In January , No Sweat sent a note to 6,000 people on its e-mail list announcing plans to make a sneaker  --  black , low-top , Converse-like  --  at the Indonesian factory . A few hundred preorders quickly followed . This was used to produce 1,500 pairs of No Sweat sneakers , which have since sold through the company 's website and a handful of stores . Neiman borrows some of Adbusters ' anti-Nike rhetoric , adding strategies like putting a leaflet in every shoebox with a reassuring rundown of workers ' benefits . Subsequent batches have been produced and sold , and Neiman has cut a co-branding deal with female antiwar group Code Pink for a pink model and with lefty magazine Mother Jones for a red high-top . He says he plans more deals like that and is hearing from more retailers . <p> LASN SEEMS TOTALLY UNFAZED by the existence of a shoe that , to most observers , delivers the things that he 's merely talked about . The Indonesian factory No Sweat uses , he claims , " was n't good enough for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of an exercise in cognitive dissonance . He is by all appearances a friendly , 62-year-old man with a charming accent , smiling like the neighborhood baker who wants your repeat business . Born in Estonia , Lasn says that as a small child he lived in a German displaced persons camp during World War II ; his parents then moved the family to Australia , and as a young man Lasn founded a market-research firm in Tokyo . He " made a lot of money , ' married a Japanese woman , immigrated to Vancouver , and pursued documentary filmmaking . Passionate about nature , he got involved in a public relations tussle with the Canadian logging industry  --  a guerrilla information skirmish  --  and that led him to Adbusters and " culture jamming . " The point of culture jamming is to undercut the endless stream of manipulative sales pitches that come at us from all directions , wearing down the mental health of the media-saturated consumer . <p> Despite his affable presentation , a good chunk of what Lasn has to say seems designed specifically to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to insult both left-wing activists and corporate titans  --  always with a grin . This is not a man who is interested in compromise or bridge-building or the sharing of control , and indeed his employees refer any question of the slightest substance back to him : Adbusters and Blackspot are both extensions of Lasn 's singular mindset , period . But in a way that is much more important than production details , it 's this mindset that he believes will set the Blackspot apart It goes to the heart of the intersection between ideas and consumption . How much power does a brand  --  or an antibrand  --  really have ? <p> To Lasn , the Blackspot exemplifies a new kind of grass-roots capitalism , driven by entrepreneurs motivated by something other than accumulating wealth . It could give consumers a new voice in the marketplace , allowing them to buy into a set of ideas that challenges the megacorporations that dominate so many industries . Lasn 's attitude toward Nike is particularly visceral , and in conversation he refers to its CEO , Phil Knight , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why this level of personal anger ? Partly because he dislikes the way Nike handled the sweatshop allegations of the 1990s . Knight " kind of ignored the no-sweatshop movement for as long as he could , " Lasn asserts . " Cleaning up those factories is not something he did out of the goodness of his heart , as far as I can tell . It 's something he did because the times changed and the pressure was put on him . " <p> But mostly , he says , he opposes Knight because the Nike brand offers a false promise . Lasn describes a hypothetical teenage boy , insecure , trying to fit in and find an identity . Where does he turn ? To Nike . The awesome brand power offers instant cool . But , Lasn continues , it 's a fleeting cool  --  a lie , a concocted image that stands for nothing but profit , manipulation , and exploitation . " I want to offer that kid a real form of empowerment ' Lasn declares , " and that 's what Blackspot is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guerrilla information war " against Nike 's cool : Be cooler . <p> There 's a certain logic to this . Nike is a big brand . It 's totally mass , with revenue in the billions , frequent big-budget television ads , a logo everyone recognizes , a ubiquitous retail presence . Why not try to be Red Bull to Nike 's Coke , or Diesel to its Levi 's ? <p> How hard could it be ? <p> Lasn is less interested in discussing the workings of sneaker factories than the antimarketing campaign he 's planned . He talks of a $500,000 war chest  --  earnings from Adbusters magazine , he says  --  that he will spend on billboards near Nike 's headquarters , on stunts like leaving black spots ( stickers or maybe even ink ) in Niketown outlets , and on print and TV ads that go after Nike and Phil Knight . One tentative TV ad shows the Swoosh morphing into a black spot as an announcer says , " No more corporate cool . " A sample print ad called the sneaker " Plain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing : kicking Phil 's ass . " <p> Obviously , such a campaign has less in common with traditional advertising than with the protest-oriented agitprop on which Adbusters has built its reputation . The essence of Lasn 's plan is brand jujitsu : Nike has built a mighty and pervasive image for itself , and the Blackspot notion is both to piggyback on that image and simultaneously to undermine it . It 's still an " information war , " not just advancing a set of ideas but trying to do so by tearing down a rival . <p> Nike spokeswoman Caitlin Morris was willing to talk a bit about No Sweat , describing its labor-description leaflet as an " interesting " idea but one that might not tell consumers the whole story . She also notes that Nike is part of an effort with other global sneaker makers to improve labor standards across the board . " Nike is pushing for a universal reporting format and a broad-based agreement about what 's relevant to stakeholders , ' she says . But she declines comment about the Blackspot ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't exist . <p> There is , however , a group that is willing to speak up : Nike fans . Yu-Ming Wu , who is 25 , is the co-founder and " sneaker editor " of a website called Freshnessmag.com , and he 's as expert on sneaker coolness as it is possible to be ( see " The Hunters , " page 131 ) . One afternoon , I talked to him and his partner , Danny Hwang , about the Blackspot , about Nike , about sneakers , and about cool . Hwang was wearing a pair of Nike Shima Shima 2 Air Max Is ( " a U.K. exclusive , " he explained ) ; they were made in Taiwan . Wu wore Air Max 90 Pythons , made in China , and noted that he owns 20 identical pairs . <p> In Wu and Hwang 's world , Nike is not a staid mainstream brand  --  it 's the undisputed king . Time and again , Wu notes , Nike has innovated in the quality of its actual sneakers ( appealing to athletes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lifestyle wearer ) , and in edgy ways to promote them . " Everybody tries to copy Nike , " Wu summarizes . Other companies now put out sneakers in limited-edition batches , or designs made in collaboration with edgy artists , or launch " urban underground " promotion campaigns . " None of it works , " says Wu . " Nike did it already and moved on to something else . Those other companies are trying to catch up . " <p> One thing Nike fans and the antipreneurs criticizing the brand seem to have in common is the idea that a sneaker can stand for something much bigger than footwear . Bobbito Garcia  --  author of the recent book Where 'd You Get Those ? , a blend of memoir , sociology , and the catalog like history of urban sneaker culture  --  makes the case for sneakers as nothing less than symbols of personal identity . He did some consulting for Nike in the 1990s , but in the book he blames the company and others for the advertising onslaught that made sneakers a mass lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its marketing savvy . And he questions the antistrategies of its upstart opponents : Like politicians who go negative , attacks on a widely rig respected brand are more likely to turn people off than rally a following ; you ca n't build an identity by being not something else . " I think it 's really , really dumb on their part to market themselves as the anti-Nike , " he said . <p> Talking to Wu and Hwang makes it clear that Nike is hardly seen in the marketplace as a stodgy and vulnerable brand . After all , Wu and Hwang are not just members of exactly the educated and plugged-in demographic that both the Blackspot and No Sweat target , they are also both of Asian descent . And neither seems to take the exploitation issue seriously , informing me that low wages in Asian factories are better than no wages . " The worst joke I tell is , " They 're employing my people , " Wu says with a deadpan shrug . <p> In late June , Adbusters creative director Michael Simons took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manufacturer apparently came to an end . Through the Vegetarian Shoe Co.  --  a U.K.-based maker of footwear that looks like leather  --  the Adbusters group was pointed toward a factory in Portugal . " He was waxing poetic about the factory , " Lasn says , " how airy it is and how sunny and well ventilated , the old-world craftsman feel . " The Blackspot , Lasn pledges , will finally be a reality . <p> The design will still be essentially a Converse low-top  --  just like No Sweat 's  --  available in any color you want so long as it 's black . One point of differentiation will be the materials : The shoe will be made of organic hemp . The Vegetarian Shoe Co. is handling the soles , which will be latex  --  " much better than the toxic foam soles of typical running shoes , " Paul Shoebridge says . ( He hopes the next batch will have soles made from recycled tires , " with the treads still on them . " ) Lasn promises the first 5,000 shoes will be completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . <p> When I was done at Adbusters headquarters , I met Billy Li , who also lives in Vancouver . Li , who is 26 , is another sneakerhead and contributes photographs to Freshnessmag.com . He 's a meticulous consumer , knowledgeable about high fashion and street trends , but he had n't heard about the Blackspot , and he did n't seem particularly impressed . Converse knockoffs ? Those shoes were n't even comfortable . And only in one color ? He showed me his collection of hundreds of pairs of sneakers , most stored in their original boxes . We spent a good half hour looking at the dazzling array of materials , colors , styles . It was like getting a tour of a connoisseur 's art collection . Needless to say , more than 95% of Billy Li 's collection is Nikes . <p> Later we went shopping . We went from mall sneaker shops to high-end department stores to exclusive boutiques that straddle the line between retailer and art gallery . The Swoosh seemed to pop up everywhere . And while Nike will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of color and pattern styles available for " real " Chuck Taylors has increased markedly over the past year . When I mentioned to Li the unusual materials in the Blackspot , he showed me some Nike hemp models : The Nike division focused on skateboarders has actually produced such shoes . Another Nike division is experimenting with a variety of environmentally friendly materials . There is an awful lot here to uncool . <p> Nevertheless , Lasn seems buoyant . " The idea of pushing your way into the capitalist game and , tussling with people like Phil Knight and taking some of the market share , I would argue this is one of the strategies that angry people , like me , have of changing the world for the better , " he says . " Rather than always snapping at the heels of the people who are playing the game , let 's get into the game . I think that it 's possible to produce a logo like the Blackspot that stands for something real . If we can do that without selling out ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what about the real-life sneaker consumer , from the casual buyer to sneakerheads from Bobbito Garcia to Yu-Ming Wu ? If they find " something real " in their brands of choice , who 's to say they are wrong ? <p> " I 'm to say they 're wrong , " Lasn declares . <p> Walking the Walk With the Blackspot ( above is the latest prototype ) , Lasn moves " from whining into action .

The two met at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan , but really bonded while exploring the nearby Lower East Side . A lot of what they did there was shop  --  or as Wu puts it , " collect . " Hwang was interested in urban art and graffiti ; Wu had a very intense interest in sneakers . " Sneakers are huge in the urban market , " he says . " Some of the artists who do graffiti art have done sneakers . " <p> Because it 's not easy to figure out where to find the coolest stuff , Hwang and Wu started Freshnessmag.com a year ago to share the information they gathered about their obsessions  --  from art openings around the world to exclusive photographs of prerelease sneakers  --  and to build an audience around it . <p> Wu is a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loves seeking out limited-edition Nikes , gathering information on new offerings and where and when they 'll " drop . " I went with him one day when a rare model called the Nike Laser  --  a series of shoes decorated with an unusual laser-etching technique  --  was set to be released . There is never a formal announcement for these events , let alone an advertisement ; word just gets around . We met on the Lower East Side , outside a store called Alife Rivington Club , which has no sign and requires customers to press a button and get buzzed in . <p> As we dashed from one shop to another  --  mostly obscure stores I 'd never heard of , although the fashion store Bameys has started getting some limited-edition Nikes  --  Wu kept bumping into fellow travelers through the world of exclusive sneakers , trading information here and there . <p> In a sense , the hunt is what Freshnessmag.com is about . The site has helped Hwang and Wu pick up invaluable contacts around the world . Wu has even been hired to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taipei to work as a design director at an electronics company  --  although that 's not the end of Freshnessmag . In fact , the pair recently made their first moves toward converting their passions into profits . They are using their connections to launch a line of T-shirts under the name Acquired , and they collaborated with a Singapore-based artist and " sneaker customizer " called SBTG , who made a set of custom Nike sneakers that went on sale exclusively through the website at $350 each .
