WHEN I BRING THE CAR AROUND for Mr. Chaplin he is not at all ready to 30 but still dressed as Tramp and talking with people on set . He sees me and shouts , Kono , I need a driver in this scene , come quick . But I stay in the car and shake my head no . I 'm in dead earnest , he says . After foolishness last night , I wonder how he still is so demanding . But ever since he starts making this movie , The Kid , he loses all his sense . I keep shaking my head no , and he says , Be a good chap , Kono , just drive past the camera . I tell him it is too dark anyway for more shooting , and this makes him angry . Now you tell me how to make pictures , is that it ? he says . But cameraman laughs and says Kono 's right , Charlie , too dark now , go on home . In dressing room I help Mr. Chaplin out of costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Tramp wig and says , I ask too much , Kono . This is true , but I tell him , For me I would not mind . And he says , I know , I know , the formidable Mrs. Kono forbids it . I put wig in box and cane on peg and wonder about this word , " formidable . " I do not know meaning , but it sounds like my wife . Three years before I have small part as driver in Mr. Chaplin 's movie The Adventurer , and I like it very much , especially making thirty dollars for two days " work-usually one whole week I work as chauffeur to make this money . But my wife finds out , and she says to me , Toraichi , you do n't bring shame on family like this ! Acting not respectable work , Mr. Chaplin may be very rich but he comes from nothing. - So my acting career is very short . When Mr. Chaplin is dressed , I drive him from studio . On our way out I see light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife and baby boy , and I wonder if they have dinner yet . I go south on La Brea , and when I turn left onto Wilshire I say to Mr. Chaplin , I think she will not be there tonight . But he does not answer . I look back and he has on hard thinking face , like when he is having new idea for scene or new picture , and then he does not hear anything what I say . But when we come close to Oxford Street , he suddenly curls up on backseat of car and asks in small voice , Is she there , Kono ? Is she there ? It is pitiful for grown man to hide from his own wife like this . Every time he does this I want to hit him on his head . But I tell him again , No worry , she will not be there , and when I see corner I say , see , no one there . Actually there is someone , but just Japanese gardener gathering rake and shovel in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and first I think he is admiring it . It is big 12-cylinder Locomobile , very impressive . But then he looks down street and back , and I think maybe he knows . Gardeners know many things what goes on around neighborhood . But this man does not know what happened last night . I can tell gardener man just like I tell Mr. Chaplin , She will not be here . Tonight she still is laughing about last night , how much trouble she cause me and Mr. Chaplin . Tomorrow night maybe she will feel sad again , have her driver bring her to corner of Oxford and Wilshire to see Mr. Chaplin go by . But tonight , no . The gardener turns back , and I see it is me he is looking at , not the car and not Mr. Chaplin . He seems familiar and it is not good kind of familiar . Then Mr. Chaplin says , Get us out of here , Kono , drive like hell-what he always says-and I do . I take Mr. Chaplin to Los Angeles Athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of home with Miss Mildred . Then I drive home and I pass Oxford Street again , but this time no one is there at all , not Miss Mildred in her car and not gardener with his look that I do n't like . When I get home my wife does not say welcome home like in Japan when the husband returns , but Oh good , it is just you . I say , Who else you expect ? And she says , You know what I mean . She sets pot on stove to reheat dinner , and I sit at kitchen table . I already tell you it will not happen again , I say to her , and she breathes out through her nose to show me she is not believing . When Mr. Chaplin first give to us the big house on studio lot , my wife and I sometimes eat meal in front of giant fireplace in living room . But then Mr. Chaplin start visiting with girlfriends , different one every time , and he wants us to serve dinner then leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Mr. Chaplin , this is insult to my wife . He frowns and says , Oh Kono , what a prig you are . But he stops visiting . We never use living room since ; we go in there only to dust furniture , we never sit on sofa . My wife hands me doorknob . Upstairs bathroom , she says . Our studio house looks very nice , like mansion of rich person . But carpenters who build it used to building sets what look good in movies , not to last long time . So everything is always breaking : doorknob falling off and window slamming down and roof leaking . I fix it tonight , I tell her . The stair railing is loose , too , she says . I will look later , I tell her . And she says , No , Toraichi , you can not fix , you talk to carpenter . I say nothing . She knows I hate to talk to set carpenters . She brings me rice and miso soup and fish , then sits down across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks . I wish to change subjects , so I say , Do we know Japanese gardener who works on corner of Wilshire and Oxford ? My wife thinks a minute and says , No , there was problem with Japanese gardener last night ? I say , No , no , not at all . You come home after midnight , she says . You sit here at table and drink . I know , this morning I wash glass . I do n't say : I spend last night with Mr. Chaplin snooping divorce reason for him . What kind of man spies on wife , hoping he find she is with another man ? Last night we sneak to his house and he stands on my back to look through window and watch Miss Mildred drinking tea with young man , but no kissing or even holding hands . This is big disappointment for Mr. Chaplin . Then this large man drags us out of bushes ; he points gun at me and asks what the hell we are doing and calls Mr. Chaplin you little runt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Go back and offer big man fifty dollars to spy for us . I say , Are you crazy ? But Mr. Chaplin insists , and I go back and gun points at me again . Mr. Chaplin always says Miss Mildred is stupid , but I disagree . Big man turns out to be private dick who Miss Mildred hires to spy on Mr. Chaplin spying on her , and young man in house is just brother of friend she invites to make Mr. Chaplin jealous . I go back to car and tell Mr. Chaplin he hires me to be driver , not spy . I say , My ancestors are samurai , this work too low for me . And he says , You come from samurai , Kono ? Well , I 'll be goddamned . I can see he likes this idea of samurai chauffeur . I can not tell my wife any of this . Man should never say something to wife without he knows what she is going to say back . Maybe my wife will be serious and say , Toraichi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe she will feel angry and say , Why you not ask him for more money , you big fool ? Or maybe she will be scared if I am shot , maybe she starts to cry. - No , that will not happen . That is American woman way . More probable my wife laughs and says , Just like Mr. Chaplin 's picture ! Or laugh harder and say , What good joke ! You tell Mr. Chaplin you are samurai ? I do n't want to hear any of these , so I say nothing . After I finish dinner , I take doorknob and go upstairs , and my wife washes up very noisy , how she does when she is angry . At end of hall I look in bedroom of my son . He is asleep in crib with his mouth little bit open and all his blankets off . I spread out yellow blanket that is gift of Miss Edna Purviance , who is star of so many Mr. Chaplin 's movies . She likes my son . Every day she asks , How is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him . Mr. Chaplin likes children , too , but it is hard for him to see my son . When he is born I ask Mr. Chaplin , It is OK we call him Spencer ? Because Spencer is middle name of Mr. Chaplin . And his eyes fill with tears , only second time I see Mr. Chaplin cry , and he says , Of course , Kono , I 'm honored , and he gives me one hundred dollars but never comes to see the baby . Before I leave Spencer I push on model airplane I make to hang over his crib . Maybe Spencer will become pilot when he grows up . One time in the past I want to be pilot . When I first come to southern California , I study at aviation school in Venice . But then I bring wife over from Japan . I know this woman always , our families engage us when we are children . But she surprises me very often after we marry-not nice and quiet like at home , but speaking her mind on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make me widow with flying business . You get a real job , like other Japanese here . And that is how I end up with Mr. Chaplin . Next morning when I leave house I see neighbor with ladder and hammer and something rolled up on front lawn . I hope they will not hang big sign to embarrass Mr. Chaplin . These neighbors are not happy about studio right next door and never friendly to me or my wife . I think to tell Mr. Chaplin , but when I get to the club he comes out with big grin and talks about splendid breakfast he ate and what glorious day to be alive , and I forget about neighbor . Because this kind of happy Mr. Chaplin always means trouble for me . On way back to studio we pass house on Wilshire and Oxford and I see gardener again . This time he is digging large hole in front yard , like to plant bushes . He has white cloth tied around his head with knot in front . His clothing are Western but headband Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I am glad he does not notice me . Maybe this man sail on Empress of China with me second time I come to America . My first trip I had nice cabin , but second time I foolishly lose money in Yokohama and have to take steerage . How can I know they do n't provide blanket for steerage ? A miserable trip . My shipmates all Japanese peasants , very poor , hoping to be farmers in America . This gardener , maybe he was one of them . Maybe I stole blanket from him . Then Mr. Chaplin says , Kono , have you heard a goddamn thing I 've said ? Now I listen and Mr. Chaplin is telling me he wants to move new actress into Miss Purviance 's dressing room . What new actress ? I ask . And Mr. Chaplin says , A charming young girl I need for new scene in The Kid . Miss Purviance will not like , I tell him , and he says , She 'll be fine , Ednas a champ , and I say again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are near studio , but I am so worried about Mr. Chaplin 's plan I forget to check what next door neighbors are up to . Miss Purviance does not like . She stomps around while workmen move her things , and then she sits in chair and refuses to talk and is mean to new girl . New girl turns out to be only twelve . Her name is Lillita MacMurray , and I remember now she comes with mother to see Mr. Chaplin for part in his picture . Now Mr. Chaplin gives her dressing room and makes new scene just for her . The scene is Tramp 's dream with everyone dressed up as angels and flying around studio on wire . Lillita is angel , too , but I do n't know if she is good angel or bad angel . She seems to be tempting Tramp and Tramp enjoys very much . I see face of Mrs. MacMurray . Now she is maybe not so happy about daughter working with Mr. Chaplin . It is strange , strange scene , but Mr. Chaplin does not hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are guests of Mr. Chaplin on set I need to take care of . Also Jackie Coogan , who is the Kid , gets splinter , and this boy who plays big fight scene for Mr. Chaplin with no crying screams and screams while I take out tiny splinter . Then Miss Purviance disappears and I must find her before she comes back drunk . I also try to find set carpenter , but they all are too busy for me . Then Miss Mildred calls twice , and I am so ashamed to talk to her , but here is where poor English and mysterious Oriental attitude become very useful . She says , Kono , you do give my messages to Mr. Chaplin , do n't you ? And I say , Mr. Chaplin very great man , very busy man . I go home for lunch , and there Miss Purviance is with Spencer on her lap . Oh , Kono , she says , do n't look grumpy , I 'm having fun . My wife hands me letter that arrives from Japan . I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , Kono-bad news ? And I say , No , because letter is from my mother and full of good news : maple trees so pretty this fall and my brother working hard , nice harvest from bamboo grove and my school friends all with good success . But there is underneath meaning : You belong here , not in strange land with no weather . And why you let younger brother take your place in family business ? All your old friends do better than you. - Bamboo is only small part of family business , but my mother always mentions to remind me when I was teenager and stole bamboo to pay for good time , drink with geisha in town , and make my father to send me to America . I wonder again about gardener on Wilshire and Oxford . Maybe he is former worker from bamboo grove . Maybe he help me take bamboo and sell . Maybe he lose job then come to America . I do n't know . I do n't remember where I see that man 's face before . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , no sloppy characters , the date in Japanese style-Taisho 9 , ninth year of Emperor Taisho reign . She wants I not forget how to be Japanese , but I no longer count years by emperor reign . I hear this emperor is insane anyway . To me it is 1920 . Or maybe Chaplin 4 , for how many years I work for Mr. Chaplin . Chaplin 4 . Why not ? He is crazy also . That afternoon when I drive Mr. Chaplin from studio lot , my wife waves to me from front porch . I slow the car and she calls in quiet voice , Hello , Mr. Chaplin , and he nods and takes off his hat for her . Then she tells me in Japanese , Do n't forget tonight we go to Little Tokyo festival . She looks like she will say something more , but she does not . I nod and say , Yes , festival-to show I remember . But my wife knows I have forgotten . I often forget things I do n't want to do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brake . Mr. Chaplin almost falls off seat and shouts , Confound you , Kono , what on earth ? I point up to giant banner on next door house . JAPS KEEP MOVING ! THIS IS A WHITE MAN 'S NEIGHBORHOOD . Member , Hollywood Protective Association Here is what my wife wants to tell me , I think . Mr. Chaplin says , Kono , they 're idiots , pay them no mind . I tell him , Easy for you to say-I am only glad my son is too young to read . But it is mistake to mention about Spencer . Mr. Chaplin stays silent for moment , then he says , Kono , I 'm late . It is cloudy , and I am happy if it will rain and this ruins festival . I am thinking about rain when we pass house with Japanese gardener . I slow down to look for him , feel half disappointment , half relief that he is not there . But then Mr. Chaplin says , What the hell , Kono , get us out of here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred parked on Oxford with stony face driver in front and Miss Mildred in back . She is so pretty with brown hair waving around her face and big eyes little too close together and so sad . I have not really looked at her since funeral last summer for her baby boy . He was born in July , just four months before Spencer , and Mr. Chaplin says , Wo n't it be nice , Kono , our children running around studio together ? But Mr. Chaplin 's boy has stomach problem and dies after only three days . After funeral Mr. Chaplin lies down on backseat of the car and cries like little boy while I drive for long , long time . People say sad times bring people close together , but this is not true for Mr. Chaplin and Miss Mildred . Mr. Chaplin , he puts all his sad feelings in The Kid . I do n't know what Miss Mildred is doing . Unfortunately , there is no rain and I take my family to festival . It is festival of local association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important Spencer will know Japanese culture and meet other people from Hiroshima . But it is not real Japanese culture , these festivals . Today is not even real Japanese holiday . And Little Tokyo is not Hiroshima . Anyway , why I want to talk to Hiroshima people ? If I want that , maybe I stay in Hiroshima . We go to the stall selling okonomiyaki , and we see people we know . All the women are maids in Hollywood or Beverly Hills , and their husbands are gardeners or cooks . One man with very red face who smells of sak says , What are you here for , Kono ? I thought you become big movie star-and everyone laughs . I say to him , Is it true L.A. cops follow your red face to find Japanese speakeasies ? Everyone laughs again , but then they start to ask , Does Charlie need Japanese actor ? or How about free tickets for Charlies next picture , Kono ? These people all laborers back in Japan , I would not be friendly with them there . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and turn to leave , only to find that gardener from Wilshire and Oxford in my way . He looks at me with sideways smile , then lets me pass by . And he says in loud Japanese , Ah , that one is too grand for us . Now not just his face but his voice familiar , too . I ask my wife , Who is that man ? She says , I find out for you , and disappears with Spencer into crowd before I can say no . I walk through street past many stalls of Japanese food , but I am not hungry . Then small parade starts with young women doing traditional dance , and I think of Miss Mildred , who is same age as these girls but already married and lose not only child but love of husband , too . After dancers comes noisy group of men in festival coats and carrying heavy mikoshi , festival shrine . They pass me and I see gardener man , his tan face strains under weight of mikoshi , and I suddenly remember this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave , but it is too crowded . My movement only gets attention of gardener . Driver man , he calls out panting . Maybe this town needs buses , too ? How about it , driver man ? He laughs as parade moves on . I fight through crowd and find my wife , who reports the man is called Sato , and in Hiroshima he- . I know , I say , he was rickshaw runner . Oh , she says , you already know . Why do you ask me if you know ? On the way home Spencer falls asleep on lap of my wife . When we pass next-door neighbor 's house we say nothing . But I know she is thinking about big sign , and I know she knows I am thinking same thing . That kind of silence very loud sometimes . At home our telephone rings like maybe it is ringing long time . Only person who calls at night is Mr. Chaplin , and it is always emergency . I answer while my wife carries Spencer upstairs to bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and before I explain he says , Mildred 's sued for divorce . This is what he hopes for so much all these months , but now he sounds not so happy . Do you hear me , Kono ? he shouts . She 'll ruin me , she 'll take The Kid , I have to get out of California-tonight . Tonight ? I say , and he says , Yes , goddamnit , tonight . When I hang up I go upstairs and tell my wife I have to leave , am not sure when I will come home . She says , If that man tells you to jump off bridge , you will do it . And she closes the door without good night . I leave to get Mr. Chaplin from the club . Clouds have cleared up and it is pretty night with almost full moon . I pass house on Wilshire , and there is now new palm tree , good size , in front yard . This gardener Sato , who was rickshaw runner in Japan , is strong man . Rickshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long pulling people behind them . They either be very strong or die early . This man Sato is strong type . I know , because one time I see him push the motor bus into ditch . When I was seventeen , after bamboo fiasco and my first time in America , I go back to Japan and try to stay in good graces of my father . He help me and my friend start bicycle shop in Hiroshima and we do it for one year , make pretty good money . But I want to fly and bicycles not so interesting to me even though I know about Wright brothers , how they start with bicycle shop , too . My friend and I , we use profit from bicycle business to buy sixteen-passenger motor bus . Motor buses have engine and take passengers , so I figure I am one step closer to airplane . We decide to start bus service from Hiroshima to Kobe . It is optimistic time for me . My father starts to talk to me again at dinner , and my mother not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn in America I start to forget . In those days there are not very many cars in Japan , so the motor bus is exciting thing to see . We arrange for grand opening of bus line and many people come , all our friends and family and also townspeople . But we have no experience , we do n't understand we make enemy of rickshaw runners . Big gang of runners come from Hiroshima and Kobe and all towns in between . We recognize them right away-they wear half-length kimono , brown or gray or blue , over dark leggings and straw sandals , and hachimaki headbands across forehead . They surround the bus and nobody stops them . Maybe at first people think they are part of entertainment of the day . Maybe I think so , too . But then this Sato points to me and my friend , and shouts to crowd , These rich schoolboys have such fancy ideas , ehh ? And everyone except friends and family start to laugh , because common people , they always ready to clap hands when good people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail . Then Sato points to the bus and shouts , Think this foreign devil wagon can beat us ? And nine or maybe ten runners with Sato start to push against the bus until it is rocking back and forth . They push and push and push together until the bus tips over and there is huge dust cloud . When it is clear we see the bus is off road and down in the ditch . The crowd shouts and claps because show is even better than they expect . If it is not my bus I will also be impressed , maybe also clap and shout . But I only think that later . At the time I am angry , and I yell and yell while Sato and his men run away . They are good runners , of course , and we do not chase after them . My father arranges for workmen to drag the bus out and sell to someone else . Then he says , Toraichi , you join family business , but I say , No , father , I go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and I see he has already money for my passage . That is last time I take money from him , and I spend on drink and good food in Yokohama . Maybe I think , If I have no money for ship , I will not have to leave . But then I wake up the morning Empress of China is due to leave and I have nowhere to go , so I end up down in steerage . And I never return again to Japan . Only thing I do what I am supposed to do is marry my wife . But she is raised to be rich merchant 's wife , not wife of chauffeur . She never expects to be waitress in her own home . She does not expect to live in house where rich man comes to entertain girlfriends . She never thinks to work for man of so low birth . I do not know how to fix for her . All I can think is how I would enjoy striking Sato in his face . Why he is here ? Does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , this can not be . I think rickshaw runners win that day in Hiroshima , but now they are losing . More and more cars in Japan , more railways and streetcars , less and less rickshaws . So he ends up here , too . But there are no rickshaw runners for rich people in Los Angeles . Here rich people have chauffeurs . When I collect Mr. Chaplin , he is very nervous , never stops talking , sometimes laughs and sometimes groans , and always telling me drive faster . I give him brandy what I keep in the car , and then he calms down little bit . Studio house is very dark as we drive onto lot , and I think of my wife probably not asleep in bed upstairs . I park outside production building , then we quickly load many thousand feet of film into big suitcases , not real leather . They are very heavy to move . The Kid is longest movie Mr. Chaplin makes so far , and I think maybe it is longest movie anyone ever makes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat a package wrapped in Japanese cloth ; inside is rice ball for me and sandwich for Mr. Chaplin . Ah , Kono , Mr. Chaplin says , your wife , what a gem . He takes long drink from flask and says , To successful marriage . I ask , Where to , Mr. Chaplin ? And he says Utah , my friend , Utah . The upstanding Mormons will protect me from my divorce . Then he gives big laugh . We pull out onto La Brea , and I do n't want to see that big sign next door , but I can not help to look . Beautiful night to run away , Mr. Chaplin says , and his cheerfulness makes me angry . I stop the car and turn around , point back to studio house . Your house is very pretty on outside , Mr. Chaplin , but we can live at another place , I tell him . He says , Good God , Kono , not threatening to quit again ? I say nothing . What is it-you want more money ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I need . I need for doorknob to stay on and neighbors not to hate us and boss not to make me spy on people and for rickshaw runners to stay in Japan . But I still say nothing . And he says , Consider it done-God knows you deserve it after tonight . He takes another bite of sandwich and says , Do tell Mrs. Kono thank you for me . Then he finishes his drink from flask and says , Now drive like hell , Kono , get us out of here . So I turn on the car again and drive toward desert . Author Affiliation NAOMI J.
