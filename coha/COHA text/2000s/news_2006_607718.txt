<p>  --  The day before this city hosts its first NBA Finals game , the man credited with the franchise 's turnaround was seated at the scorer 's table at American Airlines Center in a beat-up , sleeveless Dallas Mavericks T-shirt and shorts , fresh from a morning workout . <p> Just about every other NBA owner would have looked out of place at the first day of media availability , but not Mark Cuban , the self-made billionaire . He blended right in , sort of , and garnered a larger crowd of reporters than Mavericks guard Devin Harris , a possible starter for Game 1 Thursday against Miami . <p> Cuban 's fantasy is coming true . His team is in the Finals . His city is buzzing as if the Dallas Cowboys were in the Super Bowl . And , he 's right in the middle of it all . <p> " It 's the ultimate American dream , " Cuban said . " I 'm living this , not only for myself or my family but for a whole lot of people who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan on carrying the torch with a big old smile . At certain points in our lives , we all dream about what might happen when we grow up , how much fun it will be if maybe A , B and C will happen for me . And A , B and C has happened to me . And , I 'm going to have fun with it . " <p> Even without his considerable wealth ( he 's worth a reported $1.8 billion ) and his bull-in-a-china-shop approach to business , the 47-year-old Mavericks fan turned team owner would be hard to ignore . He is irrepressible  --  some might say insufferable  --  and constantly marketing himself and his team . He is on television or the radio marveling at his charmed existence ( " When I die , I want to come back as me , " he likes to say ) on the Internet blogging about his do-no-wrong Mavericks or responding to countless e-mails . He is on the sideline heckling opponents and referees , in the team huddle , or in the locker room watching film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will conduct himself in a different manner now that his team finally has arrived following a steady six-year climb to respectability . Maybe he 'll replace the " MFFL " ( Mavericks Fan For Life ) T-shirt with a Pat Riley Armani suit and take a more behind-the-scenes approach . " Yeah , I 'm going to be wearing a suit and some masking tape across my mouth . No . That is the joy of all of this . To be able to come this far with a great group of guys knowing that I had some small part to play in it and just enjoying every single second of it . It would n't be right to say , ' Why do n't I go out there and rip it up ? ' " Cuban said . " It 's like going to Playboy mansion with two eye patches on . It does n't make a point . " <p> Cuban has been at the forefront from the moment he purchased the team for $280 million in February 2000 . Since then , he has transformed a laughingstock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I first got to Dallas , nobody really knew us and you could go out anywhere . Nobody was paying attention to the Mavericks really and then Mark took over , " said Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki , the only player on the team with a longer tenure than Cuban . <p> Cuban sought upgrades to his roster , made risky trades for the likes of Antawn Jamison and Antoine Walker , allowed Steve Nash to walk in free agency in 2004 , handed over coaching duties from Don Nelson to the unproven Avery Johnson and cut spiritual leader Michael Finley using the league 's one-time amnesty rule . The result was that the Mavericks tied a franchise record with 60 wins and made it to the NBA Finals for the first time in the franchise 's 26-year history . " He 's a smart man , " Mavericks forward Jerry Stackhouse said . " He did n't become a billionaire by accident . " <p> Cuban also changed the way the team recruited free agents , equipped his locker rooms with state-of-the-art equipment and technology and energized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment . " Sometimes , you can lose sight of how much fun you 're supposed to have with these teams . We take them seriously , but you 're supposed to have fun . It looks like Cuban has a lot of fun , " said Sacramento Kings co-owner Joe Maloof , who is friends with Cuban . " I think at first people were a little in awe of what he does . But we all know that he 's trying to help the league . Look what he 's done with what once was a dead market  --  and a very , very important market . Dallas is a huge market for the NBA . He 's turned that town around . That town is going crazy for the Mavericks . " <p> With his brash attitude and willingness to stir the pot , Cuban has rankled NBA Commissioner David Stern on numerous occasions . " It 's not like we talk a lot . We 've got a normal business relationship , " Cuban said of Stern . " There are things we agree on , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy partnership . If we agreed on everything , he would n't need me and . . . I would n't need him . " <p> Cuban has been an open critic of the league 's officiating , amassing more than $1 million in fines . His most costly rant came following a loss in 2002 , when he said he would n't hire Ed Rush , then the league 's director of officials , " to manage at a Dairy Queen . " The league fined him a record $500,000 . The publicity has done wonders for the Mavericks ' profile , leading some to wonder if you could ever fine Cuban enough . " Not to shut me up , but sell the team , yeah , " Cuban said . " You get to the point where it 's ridiculous , then they can push me out if that 's what they desire . It 's not about getting fined . I do n't try to get fined unless I have a good reason to get fined . " <p> This postseason , Cuban ran onto the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals against San Antonio , then criticized the selection of playoff referees on his blog , www.blogmaverick.com , drawing a $200,000 fine from the NBA for both offenses . The fines appeared to pay off later in the series , as Mavericks star Nowitzki benefited from two favorable and questionable calls near the ends of Games 3 and 4 in Dallas . <p> Cuban charts officials ' tendencies and regularly voices his complaints to vice president of basketball operations Stu Jackson . After Game 5 of the Western Conference finals , Cuban asked Jackson to review an elbow Phoenix forward Shawn Marion threw at Dallas reserve Adrian Griffin , which prompted Suns Coach Mike D'Antoni to tell Cuban to " grow up . " <p> " I understand a little , but enough 's enough . I mean , get him Cuban a desk in New York . I mean , my gosh , " D'Antoni said . " The guy is doing a great job . He 's a phenomenal owner and he 's really helped basketball and he 's great for Dallas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " <p> Cuban scoffs at his critics . " Who cares ? Who lives their lives worried about what someone else thinks ? " Cuban said . " Before you guys were writing about me in the sports page , people were calling me crazy in the computer industry . People were calling me crazy in the systems integration industry . People said I was lucky . People said I was out of my mind when we started HDNet . The more people think I 'm crazy and out of my mind , typically , the better I do . " <p> A believer in the squeaky wheel philosophy , Cuban has seen positive results from his badgering . " I think I 've had a huge impact . There 's night-and-day difference from what it used to be , " Cuban said of the league 's officiating . " I do n't think it 's where it needs to be and I 've gotten in trouble for writing that  --  and there 's a lot more I have n't written . But they 're making strides and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Cuban has traded barbs with Los Angeles Lakers Coach Phil Jackson ( Cuban called Jackson his " bucket boy " after Jackson suggested that Cuban influences officials with his constant gripes ) and TNT basketball analysts Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley after they criticized the Mavericks ' effort on defense . " I 've talked to him many times after that . He still thinks he 's right . He called us idiots . I told him , ' You 're out of order , ' " Smith said recently in a phone interview . Smith added that he loves Cuban 's enthusiasm . " Here 's a guy who shows he cares about his product , " Smith said . " A lot of times the owners are invisible . They 're ghosts . They look like they have this strictly-for-the-money attitude . " <p> Cuban rubbed some of the league 's other owners the wrong way , but he said he was happy to hear a number of them congratulating him for advancing this far . " He says whatever is on his mind whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of his TV set , " said Heat owner Micky Arison , who takes a more behind-the-scenes approach . " Regardless of how you feel about his style , he has been extremely successful . " <p> And not just with basketball . <p> Cuban , who made his fortune when he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion , is also the owner of HDNet and a film producer . He helped produce the Oscar-nominated documentary " Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room , " the Oscar-winning drama " Good Night , and Good Luck " and the critically acclaimed " Akeelah and the Bee . " <p> Cuban 's tentacles are everywhere , it seems . One mind-boggling example was the sight of former Mavericks coach Nelson sitting behind George Clooney at the Academy Awards . Cuban shook his head when he reflected on the past six months . " It 's kind of bizarre , is n't it ? " Cuban said . " I have a daughter due in another two months . It 's been an over-the-top year . It 's surreal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself all the time , it 's not me . It 's all these guys who are laying it on the line . I happen to be the guy on the back of the bus , smiling and watching it and enjoying it . When it 's actually happening , you do n't ever see me taking credit for it . " <p> But you certainly do see him . And , if the Mavericks win the NBA title , people will see him in a completely different look . A suit , maybe ? " I 'm working on which Speedo I want to be wearing , " Cuban said with a laugh . " I just hope we get to that point and we can deal with it . "
