She 'd gone to bed with her shoes on , and not by accident . She 'd deliberately climbed under the covers fully clothed and pushed her shod feet down between the clean sheets . Because she felt like it . Because she was mad at the world at large and whatever force passed for God in particular . Because it was the kind of thing an icon did n't do . And Margaret Elizabeth Banning , otherwise known as Miss Li'l Bit , definitely qualified as an icon in her little part of the world . Which just went to show that if you lived long enough , any old damn thing could happen to you . At least it could in a place as lacking in a sense of humor as Charles Valley . Humor and memory . There probably were n't five people left in town who remembered that in her youth , at six feet tall , with far more nose than chin and a father who was , to put it politely , different , she had been considered a disaster . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't get herself a man if her life depended on it . Now she was an icon . " That Miss Li'l Bit , " the locals would say , to visitors who 'd come to Charles Valley to soak up its southern charm and visit its world-famous horticultural center , " she 's the real thingOld South to her toes . She 's a Banning on her daddy 's side . They 've been here since before the War of Northern Aggression , which is what we like to call it . " Pause to allow the listener to chuckle at adorable southern humor . " She still lives in that big old white house that 's been in the Banning family since her great-granddaddy bought it in eighteen sixty-eight . Runs it herself , does Miss Li'l Bit , just has that girl Cora come in to do for her twice aweek . And she keeps up the Old Justine Gardens too . Well , they 're not the originals , you understand , but she redid them close to . The Justine family is famous in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawson County until the family lost it during Reconstruction . Miss Li'l Bit 's great-granddaddy bought the big house and the gardens around it to keep it from going for taxes . The Justines were his wife 's people , cousins a couple of times removed . And Miss Li'l Bit , she keeps the gardens like they were back in the olden days . Why , she 's even got some magnolia trees that were put in a hundred years ago . " Pause for inevitable tourist response to quaint local eccentricities . " Yes , ma'am , I guess we Southerners do take our history real serious . And Miss Li'l Bitlike I said , she 's the real thing . " Well , the " real thing " was lying like a lump under her blankets , wearing the skirt and blouse she 'd put on yesterday morning , her support hose , and her second-best pair of Natural Bridge oxfords . Her admirers would be shocked . And if they knew what else she 'd done in her time . . . . But she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed so she could read the clock on her nightstand . The numbers were insultingly large , meant for eyes that were starting to fail , although of course the salesgirl who suggested it had not said so . Her nap had lasted forty-four minutes . Pleased , she turned off the vanquished alarm . She prided herself on waking before the thing went off , because no clock was going to tell her when it was time to stop sleeping . Especially not tonight . She was in control tonight . She had to be . Slowly , she pulled herself out of bed , her knees giving her the hard time she 'd come to expect . But she was n't going to coddle them . Tonight there was no such thing as aching joints . Tonight her body would have to perform . The phone rang . " Yes , Peggy , " she said , too quickly to give the caller time to identify herself . Proving she was still in control . Staying a step ahead of the music . " We 're here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young for her age as it usually did . " Maggie 's in the cabin . I came out to call you from the car phone . " " I assumed as much . " It was indulgent and needlessly showy to have rented a car with a telephone in it , and she 'd told Peggy so when she got the foolish thing . " Do you need me to come get you ? " Peggy asked . " No , I 'll be fine on my own . " " It 's real cold out , Li'l Bit . Could n't you please drive ? " " I 'll have my flashlight , and I 'll take the shortcut over the ridge . " Impossible to explain how much she needed the short walk alone in the dark to collect her thoughts . There was a weary laugh on the other end of the phone . " What 's so funny ? " she demanded . " Maggie said you 'd want to walk through the woods . She says when you 're alone in the woods that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not praynot in the mealy-mouthed way most people meantshe never had and she never would . She left the praying to Maggie , who insisted in believing in her saints and Madonnas in spite of having a first-class mind and an excellent education . Peggy continued . " That 's what we 've been doing , Li'l Bit . We 've been praying . Maggie gave me her rosary beads and we 've been saying that prayer to Jesus ' mother . I never thought I could do it tonight , but somehow having those beads in your hands really helps . And it 's much easier praying to a woman ; at least that 's how it feels to me . Maybe I should convert to Catholicism after all these years . What do you think ? " She laughed again , and sounded close to tears . Too close . " Peggy , how much have you been drinking ? " Pause . " Not more than usual . And Maggie 's sharp as a tack . She 's remembering everything . So if you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine . " " I wish you would n't use that ridiculous phrase . It makes us sound like a Gilbert and Sullivan trio . " No need to address the issue of changing her clothes . Maggie and Peggy knew her too well . " Li'l Bit , stop stalling . It 's not as bad as you 're afraid it 's gon na be . " There were times when Peggy could be unpleasantly clear-sighted . " Just get yourself over here now , " she said , and hung up . Peggy was right . It was time to get on with it . Li'l Bit took a moment to steady herself , then marched into her bathroom , where she 'd already laid out her clean clothes . Her freshly ironed clothes , thank you very much . As she entered the bathroom , a dog the size and color of Gentle Ben heaved herself up from her resting place on top of the heating vent and came over , her long brush of a tail wagging happily . Automatically Li'l Bit reached out in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vanity before it went flying . " Petula 's lights are usually on dim , " Peggy had said , when she conned Li'l Bit into adopting the half-starved mongrel , " but she 'll be a true and believing acolyte . You two need each other . " Peggy was ruthless when it came to finding homes for strays that were left at the shelter she had founded ; she 'd talked poor Maggie into taking three . Peggy named her dogs after performers she had admired over the years . Giving them a little pizzazz , was the way she put it . " Not now , " Li'l Bit said to the dog . " I ca n't take you for a walk . Go back to sleep . " Petula sighed and plopped back down on the vent . Li'l Bit picked up her comb and began to drag it painfully through hair she had n't touched in days . It was so like Peggy to turn to the sloppy comfort of Maggie 's religion . Well , let them chant over their beads and confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bit would not be joining them . She did not need mercy . And as for praying to God , she sincerely hoped she 'd been right all her life and no such being existed . If one did , he or she had much to answer for . Suddenly the comb became too heavy . She put it down and turned away from the mirror . Petula was still watching her . Li'l Bit lowered herself to the floor , ignoring the grumbling of her knees , and wrapped her arms around the dog 's neck , burying her face in thick black fur . But she was not crying . On this night she would not shed one tear . Peggy got out of the car and looked at the cabin in front of her . In spite of her brave words to Li'l Bit , she needed a minute before going back inside . She leaned back against the car and looked up at the stars . She should n't have teased Li'l Bit by bringing up the three Miss Margarets . They 'd been called that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated it . It was the idea of being lumped together that made her so mad . Li'l Bit 's fascination with her own uniqueness had always been a pain in the butt . Lately , some of the things she 'd been doing were downright weird , like that trick of hers of going to sleep in her clothes . Maggie said it was a form of depression . Well , they were all depressed , and mad , and desperately sad too , but Peggy could n't see the point in letting yourself go . If anything , she 'd been even more careful to keep herself together . She 'd had her hair done early that morning before she and Maggie drove to Atlanta . But then she 'd always been one for keeping up appearances . So often they were all you had . In her mid-sixties , she was still the perfect size six she 'd been when being a size six meant something . She favored the cotton-candy shade of blond that had done so much for Marilyn Monroe 's career , fringed her china-blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a coral lipstick that was specially formulated not to settle into the cracks . No one had ever seen her wearing flats . She forced herself to look at the cabin again . In the dark , the little house almost looked cozy . You could n't see the peeling paint and the weeds climbing up onto the porch . The old peach tree dying of neglect in the backyard was n't visible at night . The cabin nestled at the foot of a curved ridge that separated Maggie 's thirty acres , the eighty-odd acres Li'l Bit owned , and the two hundred and sixty acres Peggy had inherited when she became the widow Garrison . Peggy , Li'l Bit , and Maggie split , not evenly , a pie-shaped piece of land that sat awkwardly in the middle of Highway 22 . A dirt road connected the cabin at the center of the wedge with the highway . As was explained in the informative brochure provided to tourists by the Charles Valley Visitors Bureau , all this land had originally been the rolling lawns surrounding the Justine Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been such that the road had been split to go around it . The configuration was kept when Highway 22 was put in decades later . The lawns were long gone , as were the Justines . Over the years Maggie 's family had bought the piece she now owned , Li'l Bit 's people had acquired the chunk her house sat on , and the rest had been swallowed up by the Garrisonsas had just about everything else in the area . Much of the land between the houses was now a forest of wild pines and kudzu mixed with the remnants of old peach and pear orchards . All that remained of Justine grandeur besides Li'l Bit 's house were four huge live oaks , the last of a line of trees that once grew along the top of the ridge . Peggy looked up at them , ancient , silent witnesses to what shewhat they allwould be doing that night . She shivered and scanned the ridge instead . But there was no sign of Li'l Bit 's large frame emerging from the darkness . Why did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest like some outsized nymph ? She had a perfectly good car ; she could have driven like a sane person . The last thing they needed on this night was Li'l Bit with a broken leg . Peggy leaned back against the car , lit a cigarette , and tried not to want a drink . She 'd deliberately left her engraved thermos ( somehow it made being a lush better if your accessories were attractive ) back at her house . Maggie had had the electricity turned on in the cabin so a faint glow was coming from the shuttered windows , and the smell of the wood fire she and Maggie had laid in the fireplace was starting to perfume the air . Had the chimney been cleaned for this night or had Maggie been keeping it up all along ? Even though she no longer owned it , Maggie still took care of the cabin . Peggy wished someone would tear the stupid thing down . She wished Li'l Bit would show up . She wished she could have a damn drink . In the distance a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more joined in . She sighed ; they were probably hers . She had twelve dogs in residence at the moment . The Historical Society crowd was very upset with the way she let her darlings run free in the house , which was a Garrison home and therefore a shrine . Once in the early eighties there had been talk about having the place turned into some kind of landmark , on the grounds that it was the largest log house in the nation , but the whole thing came to nothing when it was discovered that a country singer in Nashville had built a bigger one . So her babies continued to run the hallowed halls , scratching up the foyer with doggy toenails and periodically peeing on sacred heart-pine floors . A large wooden sign outside her home proclaimed it to be garrison cottage , a form of old-money understatement she had once found enchanting . Presidents and prime ministers had slept under that **26;392;TOOLONG tin roof ; there were brass plaques on the doors of the bedrooms to prove it . Sonny and Cher , her two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador from France had used when he stayed with the Garrisons in the fifties . The three-legged black Lab puppy she 'd named Elvis swam in the pool where FDR had taken his daily exercise . Peggy stubbed out her cigarette carefully in the dirt driveway . All they needed was a fire tonight . Funny to think that as ambivalent as she was about her home nowand there were days when she really hated itthere had been a time when she had wanted it enough to pay any price for it . Be careful what you wish for , children . The barking trailed off . The cabin still loomed in front of her . And the night still stretched out ahead of them . It was n't right to leave Maggie on her own this long . She took a deep breath and started toward the cabin , then stopped . Just a few minutes more , she told herself . She lit another cigarette and looked up at the stars again . Inside the cabin , Maggie closed the bedroom door behind her and moved into the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told herself . Just think about one thing at a time . And stay in the present . No wandering back to the past and getting lost in days long gone . There would be no escaping tonight , though normally she believed in it with all her heart . Escapism , denial , and the occasional lie were the Holy Trinity of survival as far as she was concerned . To hell with the psychiatrists . Let them live to be eighty-six , then they could talk to her . The fact was , she 'd always been tougher than she looked . When you were not quite five feet tall , had never weighed more than ninety-seven pounds , and had a face that had once been described as doll-like , people tended to underestimate youwhich was a big mistake . She looked around the room , checking to see if she 'd missed a dust ball or a spiderweb when she 'd cleaned it . It was spotless . But it was all wrong , because it was empty . If she closed her eyes for just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , with the things that belonged there . There were four kitchen chairs and a wooden table with a red linoleum top in one corner , a sagging bed that served as both a sofa and place to sleep rammed against the wall . Tossed over it , a hand-stitched quilt pieced together from scraps of denim , blue jeans , and overalls that had become too frayed to mend , and backed with old flour sacks ; the antiques dealers who descended on Charles Valley every weekend would pay a fortune for that quilt today . A rag rugalso handmadeprotected the precious wood floor , and dominating the center of the back wall was an old Philco cabinet radio purchased secondhand after electricity was installed in the cabin . Those were the things that belonged in this room . She could see it all clear as day , and she could hear the voices laughing . But she must n't let herself . Not now . Later would be time enough to escape . Now she had to be clear . She moved to the window and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor thing still had n't gotten up the nerve to come back in . Well , it was only natural . She was the youngest of the three of them , and she had n't had as much time to toughen . Besides , Peggy never had been as strong as she and Li'l Bit were . Maggie was feeling very strong tonight . She was a little light-headed , and her heart was fluttering . But given the fact that it had been broken , it was doing well to beat at all . She pulled away from the window and looked back at the bedroom . It was n't empty . It was fully equipped . When she first joined the Roman Catholic Church it was the Agnus Dei that attracted her , a mantra of forgiveness that seemed to her to be the heart of her new faith . The priests said it in Latin then , the majesty of the language giving it a power that was reassuring in those years when she had been so young and needy . The words floated through her mind now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobis . " Lamb of God , You take away the sins of the world , have mercy upon us . " But would He ? Or had they finally gone too far ? The fluttering in her chest pushed up to her throat ; the light-headedness became a roaring in her ears . Palpitations , she diagnosed , good doctor that she was . A reduction of stress was what she would prescribe . Her mind made a frantic dash for safety , away from this empty room back to the time when it had been the center of a home . Back to the time when two young girls rolled back the rag rug and danced the Charleston on the wood floor . That was when it had all begun for her . That was the time that had made her different . Because she and Peggy and Li'l Bit were all different . That was why they had been able to do what they had done . And it was why , after so many years , they were able to do what they were going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all come full circle , and it was right to have it happen here in this cabin , where they had made decisions and changed lives . For the better , she prayed . Agnus Dei , qui tollis peccata mundi , miserere nobis . And now the circle was complete . Except for the one loose end they 'd never been able to fix . Except for the girl . " Maggie ? " Peggy 's gentle voice yanked Maggie back from her thoughts . She blinked and saw Li'l Bit and Peggy standing in the doorway of the cabin . Peggy was looking like she 'd love to run . Behind her , Li'l Bit was trying to be stoic and succeeding except for her eyes . " Are you okay , Maggie ? " Peggy asked . She nodded . Of course she was . Now that they were together she was fine . " I was just thinking , " she said .
