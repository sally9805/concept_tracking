In a country where women are not allowed to drive , let alone vote , Saudi Arabia 's top religious leader took one small step toward gender equality last week when he banned the practice of forcing women to marry against their will . Calling such coercion " un-Islamic " and " a major injustice , " the kingdom 's Grand Mufti , Sheik Abdul Aziz al-Asheik , proclaimed that fathers and male guardians who try to force their daughters into wedlock should be thrown in jail until the men change their minds . He made it clear that forced marriages originated as a pre-Islamic custom and are antithetical to Shari'a law , which stipulates that a woman must consent to a marriage or else it is not considered valid . <P> In the intensely patriarchal Saudi society , in which a woman made headlines last week for suing her father ( for refusing to take her back into his house after she divorced her husband ) , it 's not certain that even the Grand Mufti is powerful enough to change the status quo . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . A source close to Crown Prince Abdullah says that the de facto Saudi ruler sees the move as part of his effort to institute political and cultural reforms , and that allowing women to drive might be next on the agenda . <P> The ban is another sign that the push for democracy in the Middle East may finally be reaching women . Hundreds of Kuwaiti protesters last month demanded that women be given the right to vote . Women 's suffrage will be granted in Qatar when its new constitution takes effect in June . Women in Iraq are demanding a greater voice in the newly formed government there . And the Saudi government has even raised the possibility of granting women the right to vote in the next elections . Shibley Telhami , a Middle East expert at the University of Maryland at College Park , thinks the Grand Mufti 's statement on marriage could augur a trend . " If you start mobilizing the quiet majority by putting this on the agenda , " he says , " society starts to change . "  --  By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Amany Radwan
