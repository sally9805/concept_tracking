Our parents mess with our heads long after the first gray hair appears . As much as Al Gore insists he is not living out his parents ' dreams for him by running for President , he has followed dutifully in his father 's footsteps since he learned to walk . When he was born , 10 years after his sister Nancy , when his parents had nearly given up hope of having another child , Congressman Albert Gore Sr. got the Nashville Tennessean to announce the event on the front page , as if an heir to the throne had arrived . When his son took office in 1992 , his father boasted , " We raised him for it . " <P> What the elder Gore did n't say was that his son was raised to go further than the vice presidency , to finish what the parents had started back in 1938 , when Gore Sr. won his first congressional seat at age 30 . That alone was a remarkable feat for the son of a hardscrabble farmer , who had to work the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher 's college and then a no-account law school . He met another striver , Pauline LaFon , who worked at a coffee shop to pay her way through Vanderbilt law school . They married and merged their formidable ambitions , Pauline becoming the brains and heart of his campaigns . He won office after chucking his long speeches on reciprocal trade in favor of playing Soldier 's Joy on the fiddle . Fourteen years later , Gore Sr. boldly challenged the state 's venerated Democratic Senator Kenneth McKellar and whupped him . That made Gore Sr. a formidable presence even before he shouted , " Hell , no , " to Senator Strom Thurmond when he tried to intimidate Gore into defying the federal desegregation orders . <P> A living legend can be a terrible thing to live up to , but by all accounts , Al Jr . was an earnest acolyte . His second-grade teacher said he was so mature that she wondered whether " he was a child or a man . " He listened raptly as his father held up the phone while John Kennedy bullied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill that would create the interstate highway system , and was invited onto Vice President Nixon 's lap when he presided over the Senate . At St. Albans , an elite prep school , Gore was a diligent student and athlete . Once when the other boys were roughhousing on a class trip to Andrews Air Force Base , the little man asked the chaperone whether it was time " to be rowdy . " <P> Many people remember the young Gore as remote even as a little boy , loved by his father but treated with a courtly formality . Friends say father and son did not chat baseball and girls but monetary policy . Gore Sr. sent Al away most summers to toughen him up . On the 250-acre family farm in Carthage , Al would rise at dawn to feed the cattle , slop the hogs and clear tree-filled fields by hand . Pauline , no slouch herself , once chided her husband for pushing Al so hard , saying it would be possible for a boy to grow up to be President even " if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However formal the father-son relationship , it was strong enough that Al went off to war for him . When most kids would n't come to the dinner table wearing a clean T shirt , Al signed up for Vietnam to diminish the impact of his father 's opposition to the war in his unsuccessful fight to keep his Senate seat in 1970 . Gore , to preserve his father 's career , did what few sons of privilege had to do .
