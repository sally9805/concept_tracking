Alone in the deepwoods , night of the 6th What is it , I wonder , that has haunted this whole enterprise ? I had expected to spend this night lying awake in my blankets , clutching a knife to my breast  --  on guard against another assault  --  but here I lie alone in the woods with only my coat for a covering and I am on guard against other sorts of monsters  --  there have been screeches nearby , which must be owls , I suppose , or lions . I 've built up a fire and backed it with a rotten log , and the sticks are burning well . With Willard 's big knife I 've cut hemlock boughs for a bed in front of the long line of fire , and recline here now writing and munching upon dried apricots . My clothes have mostly dried upon me , and I suppose I 'll spend the night not uncomfortably so long as the rain holds off , and be reunited with my party in the morning . But I am low in mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard guns signaling into the darkness , but impossible to tell from which direction . This morning we took our search away from the lava tableland , bearing off steeply downhill through the brush and trees in slipping wet boots , in a pouring rain , until we had come down upon thickly wooded , flatter ground  --  not a great expanse of it , but several outspread fingers and tongues hedged in by the numberless ridges . Willard 's idea was that a child wandering lost would stick to the low valleys , the flattish ground , and would not be found upon the steep slopes , which idea wore a certain logic ; or we had been made receptive to it by virtue of our own exhaustion . Our tents were brought downhill and pitched along the footings of the lavaridge ( lying more or less at the palm while we searched up the several fingers of the glove ) , and the sorry horses were freed of their enormous swaying burdens and left to munch the scant grass at camp while we two-footed fools set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had need of , and little else ( which of course I now have reason to regret ) . Being by this time old hands at the search , we scattered ourselves wordlessly through the trees . I kept as near to Gracie Spear as could be privately accomplished and beat about the brush without any hope of finding Harriet alive or dead . I confess I had in mind only getting through the day without breaking any bones , and speedily tomorrow returning to dry clothes and stove heat and my own house , my own dear children . The rain went on until we were thoroughly wringing wet and our boots sloppy ; until every depression in the ground , every bunker in the rocks , every hollow among tree roots was inches deep with muddy water and floating detritus . Then the sky lightened to Quaker gray , and steam began to rise from the ground  --  a startling illusion of vulcanism  --  and it was the end of rain for the time being . ( Why do you suppose one feels the clamminess of clothes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still falling ? ) Then occurred an extraordinary adventure . There is a certain science to the spying out of larger holes and caves in a lava field , certain signs and markers I had become alert to while in the field yesterday , and though we had left the lava behind us , such awareness had not deserted me ; in the late morning , after the rain had quit , I was drawn to examine a particular hemlock growing oddly askew , which investigation found the tree tilted over a cavernous sinkhole . I am still agile , or as much as can be expected at middle age , and did not hesitate to shinny along the tree trunk to a point that allowed a short drop to a sloping rock ledge , which then allowed of a careful descent , tossing pebbles ahead as I groped into darkness by the insignificant flare of matches . Quickly it was clear : this was a reverberating , pitch-black passage of huge proportions . My first thought was that we should be prevented from a thorough search of the cave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pitchy torch not easily to hand in this country of sodden wood . But I nevertheless went after the next-nearest person , which of course was Gracie , and when I had explained the point  --  cave too large , lacking sufficient light  --  she made a little happy chirrup and said , " I got just the thing . " With a self-satisfied flourish she brought from her lunch sack a kerosene oil lamp no more than five or six inches tall , which I recognized , with a glad thrill of commonality , as a bicycle headlamp . ( It was a false trail . " Oh , I ai n't never rode one of those things , " she told me , her mannish face rosy and artless ; she had only admired and coveted the lamp 's miniature stature . ) So after all , we investigated . I went ahead of her , snaking out on the tree again and jumping down to the slanted ledge , after which she reached the lamp down to me and followed my example . I should guess her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but built too thick and low to the ground for nimbleness : she sat astride the tree trunk and leant forward to embrace it , then dragged herself along it by inches , which got her to the necessary place for jumping down . I held the lamp before us as we began a slow progress down the slippery stone chute . This entrance proved to be a small lava sink littered with rock rubble , which after one hundred feet or so let into the sidewall of a very long , high-ceilinged throughway grooved with flow marks and a whole succession of shallow ledges . At other places in the lava field there had , of course , been open gullies and intermittent stone bridgework , which must be the skylighted leavings and minor versions of such caves ; but this one was a considerable size  --  entirely intact . I am no spelunker but have read enough to know : they are formed by rivers of lava which , cooling , forms a thick top crust and simultaneously eats away the ground beneath its molten stream , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is left is a through tunnel . The small light cast by the bicycle lantern made a circle of dim illumination that allowed us to see the tube stretching away in both directions for an indeterminate length , and the ceiling twice higher than hand 's reach . I have read of tunnels thousands of feet long : Ole Peterson 's Mount St. Helens Lava Cave , which can not be more than a dozen miles from here , is a modestly famous international destination for tourists and speleologists . Inarguably , no human child would choose to shelter herself in such a place  --  the vast , echoing chamber seemed , even to me , a gateway to the underworld . But the cave air was somewhat warmer than the chilly daylight , and dry despite the hard rain overnight and this morning ; I could imagine a wild creature  --  bear or wolf , if not orang-utan  --  happily choosing such a cave for winter quarters . Gracie Spear , while saying nothing of apes nor the unlikelihood of a child hiding so deep underground , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have seen more evidence of the savagery of men than of savage ape-men , which on the one hand frees me from fear of cave monsters . On the other hand , if no phantasmal beast had dragged Harriet to its den inside , what could be the point of looking for her there ? I can not , even now , divine the answer , but something of a wordless compulsion came over me . I said to Gracie , " We should n't let this cave go unexplored , " and gave her a firm look . I have always felt occultism to be the realm of fools and natural idiots ; perhaps it was n't any glimmer of intuition or clairvoyance that impelled me into the depths of the cave , perhaps it was my scientific bent and natural curiosity . ( Lava tubes are nothing like the limestone caves in France , of course , but they have their own interest ; and a large , dry stone room holds none of the terrors of the lava rimrock , its small tunnels and chasms doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I should report is only that something  --  something  --  drew me in . And in the event , though we did n't find Harriet hiding in the black cave , and no giant orang-utans leaped upon us from the darkness , we were certainly led to a discovery . The left-hand of the tunnel was blocked after some two hundred feet by the rocks and rubble of its broken-down walls and ceiling . The right-hand , though , went on for as much as a thousand feet , with a sandy floor of volcanic ash and pumice , and dark walls glazed and shiny as glass from the excessive heat of the lava . The walls narrowed gradually , and the ceiling lowered until we were made to crouch , but then opened suddenly to a roundish vaulted room like the cupola of a house  --  it was the furthermost reach of the tunnel , sealed by the breakdown rubble of the ceiling  --  and when we rose erect inside this space and lifted the lamp , I was seized with wonder . There were husks of empty nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell which I took to be feral , but the furnishings of long-absent tenants , scattered in disarray , were specifically human artifacts : chipped and flaked bits of stoneware ; fragments of carven or heat-shaped wood ; a broken strand of twisted leather strung with shells or bone ; the unknit remains of what had once been woven strips of cedar bark ; moldering feathers fallen into pieces , which one could imagine had been joined into a sort of cape or blanket , though many were now incorporated into a wild animal 's artfully arranged nest on a high ledge at the rear of the room . Gracie , perhaps seeing only that we had reached a blind alley , snuffled through her broad nose and said , " Shee-it , what a stink . " I rate highly any woman who will freely swear and say the word " stink , " but on this occasion I would rather have had a woman with an appreciation for ancient relics and mysterious rooms hidden in the deeps of forbidding caves . I held up for her a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize as a spearhead , and in the other hand a bit of bone carved into something like a button . " Someone lived in this cave , Gracie  --  aboriginal peoples . These things are of great age , and valuable to Science . " She retreated a step and arranged her face in a disapproving frown . " They do n't look old to me , only wore out ; we better not go poking around in here . " I chided her for the foolishness of her reluctance  --  " Believe me , no one is returning to cook their supper in this room "  --  but when this did nothing to persuade her , I took another tack . " We have a duty to gather these artifacts and get them into the hands of Anthropology , " I said . She took a dim view of this idea as well , and went on standing over me with her reproving look while I took out my knapsack and began to collect into it the partly intact pieces of implements and tools , stone spearheads and arrowheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were astonishing finds  --  a well-formed cylindrical stone pipe !  --  an intact , finely made awl !  --  and I should still be sailing on the excitement of these discoveries except for the last one , which somewhat capsized me . At the very rear of the room , in the darkness where the stone shelved away in a series of ledges , behind that neat feather bed some animal or other had made , I lifted a fragment of matting or basketry and found lying beneath it a human skeleton . For one irrational moment I believed it was Harriet , and my heart lurched . But of course , the bones were ancient , and identified by their Indian accoutrements . " Oh , lordy , what 's that you 've got there ? " Gracie said , and brought the lantern . It was the bones of a small person or an older child , short of leg , with the wizened rabbit-fur moccasins still on its feet ; and amid the little pyramid which was the piled-up bones of both hands , a fetish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its breast . I am sometimes forced to admit that my childhood inclination toward romanticism remains stronger in me than my adult study of the sciences ; and this was one of those occasions . As we two women stood and looked on those bones in silence , I believed I could feel a very old sorrow creep into the room . The arrangement of the body , lying undisturbed on the basalt bench , had a touching posture of peace , and I was struck by the realization that this rock room was no longer someone 's dwelling place but had become someone 's tomb ; I 'm afraid my enthusiasm for collecting the ethnological scraps and fragments of a person 's life began , in those moments , to desert me . " I never have heard of the Klickitats , the Cowlitz , and them burying their dead people in caves , " Gracie said in a low , somewhat affronted tone . ( It 's the Western way to pretend a serious acquaintance with local Indian custom . ) " No , I never have heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also on the firmer ground of scholarly knowledge . This opened the door to several speculations  --  the sort of thing at which I am particularly adept . I told Gracie : These could very well be the bones of a suitor who had been traveling with his entire dowry to the village of his betrothed  --  he had sought shelter from an ancient volcanic eruption  --  had composed himself to die alone from horrid wounds received in the showers of flaming rock . Or the only survivor of an ancient tribe decimated by disease  --  her desperate parents had sequestered her in the deep cave , safe from wolves and weather and their own horrid plague  --  had furnished her with every tool necessary for her survival  --  she 'd lived alone for months or years until at last succumbing to loneliness . Or a feral boy raised by bears  --  he 'd later been killed by an arrow from his own human tribe , but his mother , recognizing her long-lost son , had tenderly returned his body to the bear den for interment , along with certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these possibilities eagerly and supported them , one after the other , with an embroidery of her own details  --  a desirable tendency in a companion . When we had thoroughly satisfied ourselves that the anomalous cave burial was capable of explanation , we considered what we should do with our discovery  --  a brief and agreeable discussion which led to our leaving the bones exactly as we had found them , except that I placed on the stone ledge beside the body a respectful array of the artifacts I had gathered into my sack . I suppose I should consider this a loss to Science , and a foolish surrender to sentimentality . Had I been with Pierce , or Willard , or especially Norris , the photographist , I do n't doubt I would have behaved differently . But we were two women  --  they are disgracefully sentimental creatures , after all  --  and Gracie , having her own particular devotion to privacy and the natural rights of ownership ( even as regards the dead ) , may have been an undue influence . I find it difficult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain or defend my performance . At the time , not only did I feel in a particularly weakened emotional state due to recent events , but I felt myself inhabited by a strange and intimate awareness of the ancient past as it related to the present  --  something of a spiritual nature  --  something which does not readily yield itself to words . If related to my gender , I shall hope it was not womanish sentimentality but intuitive reason , which Science allows is a woman 's natural and creditable inheritance . And I should say , as well , that my mind had made a kind of premonitory leap from the bones in the cave to what must be Harriet 's dire fate ; I blame this on an inclination toward literary metaphor . When we came out of the lava tube into the daylight  --  no resumption of rain , as yet , but a cold overcast and an ill wind  --  we resumed our search without remarking on the futility of it , simply tramping on through the deepwood , zigzagging around the ruins of logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sat to eat our lunch in a lightly forested glen where some others of our party were already stopped . Earl Norris fussed and fiddled with his camera and tripod from the vantage of a mossy rockfall , while Almon Pierce and E. B. Johnson and an old ox logger by the name of Edward Stanley huddled in gloom around a smoky bonfire which had not even the advantage of rain cover from overhanging evergreen boughs ; they chewed dry crusts of bread and hard jerked meat while submitting to their photograph . It occurred to me that Gracie and I had made no decision as to whether we would share our news  --  our discovery of the lava-tube cave and its furnishings  --  with the men . I suppose if Gracie had blurted out the story , I 'd have readily joined in ; but she did not . I held off , myself , from an indefinable reservation , and perhaps also from grudgingness  --  not wishing to share our sentimental , private knowledge with the villain in our midst . In any case , due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them gave us the benefit of a greeting . Gracie and I carried our lunches off somewhat from the others and ate together in silence . Our association was transformed , of course , to one of friendship  --  we were easy in each other 's company  --  but the truth is , I was not in a conversational frame of mind , and our differences are profound . While we sat together eating our crackers and cheese and washing all down with the liquor from Gracie 's tin of peaches , we exchanged only a few private words on the subject of the local distilled spirits ( the Amboy prune brandy , which by now I thoroughly lamented not buying ) and , of course , the weather , which is always a safe topic . I was briefly troubled by a wish to confide in her the specific events of the night before , but I suppose such things are best dealt with sub rosa ; and in any case , no occasion for intimacy arose from our discussion of fruit wines and rain . We did discover a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought forth a twisted black pigtail from her shirt pocket , carved a thumbnail-sized plug , and deliberately seated it in her cheek ; which encouraged me to do the same . While half reclined against our respective blowdowns , we each gazed upon the other 's vile and un-ladylike tobaccoism with solemn , if unvoiced , admiration . ( And inasmuch as spitting women are evidently newsworthy , we were hurriedly made the object of Norris 's yellow-journal picture taking . ) In the afternoon , having suffered through a resumption of showery weather and a rising westerly wind , I became much in the mood to quit the search , but slogged on  --  I admit  --  for the sole reason that the others were seemingly unremitting , and I would not be the one to suggest our discreditable surrender . My affrighted need to keep Gracie in my sight gradually subsided ( I blame increasing lethargy ) , and though I glimpsed one or another of my party or heard them hallooing to Harriet in a hoarse monotone through the long afternoon , I often labored alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the corpses of old trees and climbed onto the thrones of their rotted stumps ; from time to time I poked a stick into a thicket of wild raspberries . But I 'm afraid I became more and more perfunctory , doing as little as could be managed without seeming to have given up the search entirely . I am not as a rule a startlish person , but may have been brought to timidity and trepidation by recent events ; I can not , otherwise , explain what occurred  --  two events within minutes of each other , and in large part to blame for my present situation . In the mid-afternoon , after I had not seen or heard others of my party for a good interval , Almon Pierce arose suddenly from the brush behind me , which provoked me to a wild-Indian yelp and my constitutional defense against surprise , which is a malicious glare . This astounded and mortified the boy more than might have been expected  --  his face flashed crimson , and he was gone  --  had turned and fled into the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess , I stood for some little while afterward in frozen apprehension  --  knew instinctively and utterly that Almon Pierce had been my midnight assailant and that I had just saved myself from a further assault . I can not account for this now except to plead the overwrought mind of a beleaguered and exhausted woman . Which must also be blamed for what followed . Having recovered myself ( so it seemed ) , I went on through the trees some few hundred yards , examining the root flares of thousand-year-old cedar trees , and simply became aware , with absolute and sudden certainty  --  the heaving over of my heart in my breast  --  that evil eyes were upon me ; became sure of the presence of someone else glimpsed only as a shadow , a heaviness , a shape behind the trees , which vanished as I turned my head . I am half ashamed to admit I took out Special Agent Willard 's deer-foot-handled knife and brandished it in the air , while fiercely calling out , " Halloo , damn you , who is there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my own rabbity tremolo . Here is the truth , which can only be told in the privacy of these pages : I quite lost courage , believing someone was there  --  Almon Pierce again , or a beast , and in either case breathing death ; and I plunged off through the deepwoods like a deer . It is humiliating to realize one 's base fear lies so near to the surface . When I had got over my blind flight ( not long ) and got hold of my senses , I surrendered to a weaker impulse and made off directly for camp , with every hope of finding at least one or two of the others waiting ( shameful if I should be the first to call it quits ) , and the comfort of hot soup , as well as a tent to get in out of the rain . It was at that time just past two o'clock . In the neighborhood of four o'clock , having struck no sign of camp nor indeed of the lava ridge , and no glimpse of Gracie nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain anxiety and restlessness . I had been holding the terrain lightly in my mind , which is a coherent enough map , and I am usually unerring in the matter of orientation ; but we had been keeping to the flattish troughs , and the whole of our traverse was gradually uphill , which I suppose had led me into a kind of complacency regarding which way was " back "  --  that is to say , downhill . I may also have gotten turned around somewhat , while bolting from shadows . Further , this is a jumbled country , no less so than the lava tableland  --  a muddle of ravines and gullies and ridges which give upon one another in a confusing way . In any case , subsequent hours were spent casting back and forth deliberately along the low ground until I became aware that , in the darkening shadows , injury was ever more likely . I am not worried in the slightest  --  have certainly spent many nights alone in the woods and have sufficient flesh on my bones to stand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in case I do not find my fellows in time for breakfast ; but I have hardtack and cheese in my pockets ) . And here is an adventure , after all , and a story to embellish for the boys when I have regained them as an audience . On the Columbia River I have found evidence of the former existence of inhabitants much superior to the Indians at present there , and of which no tradition remains . Among many stone carvings which I saw there were a number of heads which so strongly resembled those of apes that the likeness at once suggests itself . Whence came these sculptures , and by whom were they made ?  --  James Terry , Sculptured Anthropoid Ape Heads , Found in or Near the Valley of the John Day River , a Tributary of the Columbia River , Oregon ( 1891 )
