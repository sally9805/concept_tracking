Lisa Goldstein 's many novels include The Dream Years , Strange Devices of the Sun and Moon , The Red Magician , Dark Cities Underground , and Tourists . There are rumors afoot that she has begun writing under a pseudonym , but on this topic she will only say that she is most definitely not writing as " Robin Hobb . " Ms. Goldstein writes short fiction much too infrequently for our tastes , but when she does , the results are usually very interesting and enjoyable ... as is the case in this new take on a classic tale . <p> ONE BY ONE THE WISE WOMEN entered and sat in a circle around the cradle . There was Betony , who had grown vague and nearsighted over the years , and Bramble , who shook with palsy and needed help sitting down . There was Juniper with her endless knitting , and Tansy , whose cloak had turned the color of the wall behind her , so that the eye slipped over her and moved on to the next woman . And Anise with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed as ostentation . The queen sat quietly and rocked the cradle . She had the look of all new mothers who have delivered a perfect child , smug and loving at the same time . Without realizing it she had begun to hum a lullaby . Finally all the women had arrived . The queen looked up at the witches and smiled . " Please bless my son , " she said . " Give him the virtues he 'll need to rule the kingdom , whatever you think he should have . I rely on your judgment . " Betony , the oldest , went first . " He will be very handsome , the comeliest in the kingdom , " she said . Then they continued around the circle ; Bramble gave him health , and Anise laughter , and Tansy the desire to rule fairly and with wisdom . The queen 's attention wandered . Truth to tell , she did not believe these women needed to bless her child , who was already flawless in every way , but her husband had urged her to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the king had said . " Flatter them , pretend they 're important . They could probably do some mischief if you do n't go through the motions with them . " She forced herself to listen . " I give him the gift of charm , " Juniper was saying . " All will love him and delight in his company . He will be famed for his grace from one end of the kingdom to the other , and the people will call him Prince Charming . " How lovely , the queen thought . She smiled and gazed down at the child . The door to the nursery opened . A cold wind blew through the room , brushing aside cloaks and skirts and scarves and tapestries . Candles flickered perilously ; one flame reached out hungrily to the hangings around the boy 's bed before steadying . " Charming ? " the woman standing at the door said . " You always were a fool , Juniper . You might as well have given him stupidity and be done with it . " The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did n't think to invite me , did you ? " she said . She was stocky and gray-haired ; in this company of wild eccentrics she looked very ordinary , like someone 's grandmother . Who on Earth was she ? " You do n't remember me , do you ? " the woman said . The queen stirred uncomfortably ; had the witch read her mind ? " I 'm Yarrow . I was at the coronation , and at your wedding too , dearie . " The queen opened her mouth to demand respect . Suddenly , though , she did remember her . There had been a circle of witches at the wedding , and yes , this woman had been among them . Then she had disappeared , gone back to the forest where she lived , and no one had mentioned her in the years since . The queen had forgotten all about her . " We sent a messenger to the forest for you , " the queen said . Not for nothing had the king insisted she learn diplomatic skills . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yarrow said pleasantly . " Is that what you 'll teach your son , how to lie ? Is that the ability you want me to give him ? " " No , no , please . " The queen heard the fear in her voice . Ridiculous , she thought . My husband could banish her over breakfast , without even thinking about it . " What about a delight in cruelty ? " Yarrow said . " Would you like that for your son ? Or forgetfulness , the ability to forget a poor old witch living alone in the forest ? Perhaps I should just make him feeble-minded , turn his brains to porridge . " " No ! " the queen said . She looked around the room . " Help me , someone - please ! " No one moved . They were afraid of this woman , she saw , and her own fear grew . " I swear I did n't mean to slight you . I swear I would have invited you if- " " If you 'd remembered , yes of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There are some things you just do n't see . Not your fault , of course - it 's the way you were raised . " She studied the infant . " Blind ? " she asked , meditatively . " No ! " " No , all right , I have it , " Yarrow said . The queen tried to stand but could not move ; some unseen force seemed to hold her back . Yarrow raised her hand over the cradle . " I give you your destiny . There is a princess who was once the desire of every man who saw her , a woman surpassingly fair . But she fell into an enchanted sleep , and though many men tried to bring her back to life none succeeded , and the world forgot her . It will be your fate to quest for her and to find her while you are still young . You will see her sleeping amid the ruins of her castle , and you will kiss her . And at that kiss she will awaken , and you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You - I - that - " " That was n't so bad ? " Yarrow said . " Well , perhaps it was n't . " The queen thought over everything Yarrow had said . A princess surpassingly fair . A successful quest while the prince was still young . A marriage . She could find nothing wrong . But then why was she so frightened ? Why had Yarrow 's last words made her shiver ? " I - I thank you , " the queen said , trying to keep her voice steady . She looked around the room . " I thank you all for your help , your wonderful gifts . You are excused now . " And she picked up the child and went out of the room , leaving the witches to gossip behind her . THE QUEEN FORBADE all mention of Yarrow 's words , and she did her best to forget everything that had happened that day . She noticed with disgust that folks began to call the prince Charming , a name which , after what Yarrow had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned herself to it . If that was the only result of that dreadful day , she thought , they had gotten off lightly . She had to admit , though , that the boy lived up to his name . Everyone loved him , from the cooks to the chamberlain ; he knew all their names and would stop and talk to them as if they were his dearest friends . And while he talked to them he did seem to hold them in genuine esteem , but when he left he would shrug them off and go on to the next person , and the next , and charm them in turn . In fact , the queen thought , the boy seemed somewhat feckless , unable to stick with anyone or anything . She had once discovered him playing cards with his tutor , and when she asked how long their lessons had been neglected she was unable to get an answer from either one of them . The cook slipped him extra desserts , and a whole host of boys came forward to take the blame whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be worse , though ; the queen knew that . He could be .... But she was never able to finish the thought , - she would simply look at him and smile , as charmed by him as all the rest . When Charming was ten he came to her and asked about the enchanted woman he was supposed to rescue . Someone had told him the story , then ; well , it was bound to get out , the way the people in the castle gossiped . She repeated the prophecy in as offhand a tone as she could manage . " I doubt it 's true , though , " she said . " Yarrow wanted to frighten us , that 's all . She was a bitter old woman . " " What did she say about the princess , though ? " he asked . His eyes seemed lit with excitement . " Will she be beautiful ? " The queen thought back . She had tried so hard to forget the prophecy that she could truly not remember all of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could mean anything ! " he said . " She could be beautiful , or honest , or have a pale complexion .... " The queen 's fear returned . Suppose the woman were honest but very ugly ? Could that have been what Yarrow had meant ? The queen had not managed to have other children ; what if her grandchildren were hideous ? Would the people even acknowledge their rule ? Then she remembered something with relief . " No , she said that the woman was the desire of everyone who saw her . She must be beautiful then . " Beautiful or able to enchant people to desire her , the queen thought . No - she would not think about it . Nothing bad would happen to her son . And to her relief he appeared satisfied with her answers , and went away looking thoughtful . He seemed unwilling to let the subject alone , though . " How long will this quest take ? " he asked a few days later , while she was sitting at her desk and planning the castle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'm still young - what 's the oldest you can be and still be called young ? " " I do n't know , Charming , truly . " " But I have to know how much food to take with me when I go . " Fear overwhelmed her , so that she saw and heard nothing for a while . " You 're not going anywhere until you 're older , do you hear me ? " she said finally . " And if you do go on this ridiculous quest you 'll take any number of soldiers and hunters and trackers with you . " He came back a few days later , when she was embroidering with her ladies-in-waiting . " What if I find her but I do n't want to marry her ? " he asked . The women laughed . " You can marry anyone you like , dearie , " one of them said . The queen shivered at the word dearie , though she did not know why . " Please , stop bothering me about this , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pack of confused old women . Anyway , I have n't seen any of them since you were born - they 're probably all dead now . " " Father believes them . " That was true ; the king believed all sorts of things . He consulted the ancient priests every morning and listened to their prophecies , and he would do no work that day if the omens were unfavorable . It had been her husband , the queen remembered , who had asked her to invite the witches to bless her child - and look where that had led . " I do n't want to discuss this anymore , " she said . The years passed . Charming stopped asking questions , though whether he had forgotten all about Yarrow or was questioning others the queen did n't know . For herself she managed to put aside Yarrow 's words for whole seasons , and there were times when she was even happy . But the prophecy would come back to her at odd moments - in the midst of banquets , or as she nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her heart . Then , on the morning of Charming 's eighteenth birthday , she awoke to find him gone . THE SUMMER THAT YEAR was mild , the days pleasantly warm . The trees hung heavy with fruit , so that Charming had only to reach out for a pear or an apple when he felt hungry . When evening came he went a little ways off the road and tethered his horse and lay down , the nights so balmy he did not even need a blanket . He did not think about any of this . He had always had an easy time of it , and he had never doubted that his quest to find the princess would be more of the same . He did not think about the many years of peace that had created the wealth he saw in the countryside , or how hard his father the king had worked to keep his realm from war . He sometimes sang about ancient quests as he rode , about heroes who had faced dragons and war and death , but it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it did not surprise him that he found what he sought a scant two weeks after he started out . A miller he met told him a story about an enchanted castle . " They say a princess lies sleeping in the ruins , " the miller said . " I 've never heard of anyone who went to look , though . " Charming thanked him . As they parted the miller gave him a fresh loaf of bread , though Charming had not asked for it , or told him who he was . The prince thanked him again , by rote this time ; he had long ago grown used to people giving him things . In the week that followed he found more and more people who knew about the ruined castle . One of them told him that the princess was called Beauty , and at this his excitement grew . I knew it ! he thought . I knew she would be beautiful . Finally one morning he squinted up at a mountain peak and saw a mass of tumbled walls and fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the mountain looked steep and difficult - but then he shrugged and turned his horse toward the foothills . The path was steep ; he was sweating by the end . At the top he saw that a briar hedge had once guarded the castle , but the plants had died sometime over the years and his horse stepped over them easily . Beyond the briar stood the wreckage of the castle walls . He hesitated , wondering if he should clean himself before he presented himself to the princess . But his eagerness and curiosity got the better of him and he urged his horse over the fallen castle gate ; the hooves made a hollow sound on the rotting wood . The floor within was marble . Whole sections of the roof had fallen in , and he had to be careful where he placed his horse 's feet . A dusky sun shone through the gaps in the roof , illuminating worm-eaten tapestries and broken furniture . He explored the entire castle this way , moving from shade to sun and back to shade again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords and shields hanging against the walls , and the bones of small animals who had starved looking for food . In one high tower he found great piles of ruined books ; perhaps a wise man had worked here , searching in vain for an answer to the princess 's enchantment . He had had to dismount to climb the tower , and when he came back down he continued from place to place on foot . A while later he found himself exploring rooms he had already seen , and he realized he had gone through the entire castle . Could this be the witch 's curse , that he would look for the sleeping princess and not find her ? If so it was a paltry curse , ridiculous even ; he had had a fine time on his travels , and he would come home with any number of good stories to tell his friends . He left the castle and gazed up at the ruins again . This time he saw something he had missed before , a small tower near the back . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there it was , a shaded alcove and stairs leading upward beyond it . He began to climb . His heart was beating loudly ; he could not remember ever having this feeling of anticipation . The stairs ended at a small circular room . A woman lay on a bed under a window . He moved closer . His blood thrummed in his ears . And now he saw the witch 's terrible design , the purpose behind the curse she had laid on him . The woman had aged along with the castle . Her face was scored by lines , hundreds of them , and marred with blotches . Her eyelids were thin as paper , her nose a bony beak , her mouth sunken . Bristly hair sprouted from her chin and above her lips . The hair on her head was gray , and so sparse that Charming could see patches of her scalp ; thin wormy strands reached to her thighs . At the thought of her thighs the prince turned away , shuddering . The witch had been fair , scrupulously so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and surely men had quested for her without success . How old was she ? A man he had spoken to on the road thought that the enchantment had happened a hundred years ago ; if the princess had been , say , twenty , or even fifteen .... He shuddered again , but with pity and not disgust this time . He could still give her a kiss , he thought ; he did not see how he could be made to marry her . He forced himself to turned back . Now he noticed a sour odor coming from her skin , the smell of old age . He took a breath and leaned over and kissed her . Her lips tasted like dust . She stirred . Horror and pity overwhelmed him . What had he done ? How could he have been so stupid , why had n't he let her sleep forever ? Could he call back his kiss ? No , she was stretching now , and opening her eyes . A cataract filmed one eye , a gob like an egg white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , the expression of someone who had grown used to being loved for her beauty . Her teeth were gray . The prince took a step backward . " Who are you ? " she asked . " My legs hurt , and my arms . Have I been ill ? Why ca n't I see you properly ? " " You - " The prince cleared his throat . " You 've been under an enchantment . " " That 's right , " the princess said . " I remember now . A horrid old woman said that I would sleep for a hundred years . And have I ? " She tried to push herself up but fell back on the bed , breathing heavily . " Yes , my lady . You - " The princess cried out . Her voice was hoarse , from age and from disuse ; her scream sounded like a rusty box being forced open . She had brought her veined and misshapen hands close to her eyes , Charming saw , they looked like bags of lumpy produce . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why ca n't I sit up ? Am I still under that evil woman 's spell ? " He did not want to tell her . He wanted to run from the room , mount his horse , and ride home as fast as he could . Someone else could come back and take care of her , a friend or one of the castle servants . He could n't do that to her , though . " You 've been asleep for a hundred years , " he said . " And in that time - " " I 've aged a hundred years ? " Her voice rose in a screech on the last words . " But I 'm - I was eighteen years old . I was eighteen just yesterday ! How could I ... what ... oh , curse that woman ! I 'll kill her ! My father will kill her ! " She sat up , panicked . " Where 's my father ? Is he dead ? " He probably was , the prince thought . Now he understood the destruction he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to break the enchantment the people had fled , hoping to live a normal life elsewhere . The king had probably grown old and died , along with the cooks and washer-women and advisers and dressmakers and grooms . Fortunately he did not have to tell her this , at least not yet . She had doubled over and was sobbing and screaming , unable to believe her terrible fate . She cried until she was exhausted , and then fell asleep . When he was certain she would not waken for a while he lifted her - she weighed almost nothing - and carried her down the tower stairs and outside . He found a cart in the stables and laid her in it gently , then fixed the cart to his horse and headed home . She slept for a long time . He felt relieved that he did n't have to talk to her , or hear her terrible cries . In the evening they stopped at an inn . As he took her in his arms her eyes opened , but she said nothing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face . He carried her inside and got rooms for them both . " Your grandmother ? " the innkeeper asked , and Charming scowled at him . Her expression did not change as he took her to her room and set her gently on the bed . He went to his own room , pulled off his boots , and lay down . He could not sleep ; he felt haunted by something he had not done . But no one could have behaved better , he was certain of that . He would take her home and give her into the care of his own physician , who would see that she rested comfortably for the rest of her life . A short life , sadly , but there was nothing he could do about that . He had lived up to his name , he had been as charming as he knew how . They could ask nothing more from him . Still , he felt ashamed . He remembered how relieved he had been when she had fallen asleep . He hated illness and disfigurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars on the street but had to delegate one of his friends to give them money . He knew he lacked something , strength perhaps , or perseverance . He knew that folks thought him frivolous , his amusements trivial ; even his best friends thought so . He had never cared until this moment , when he wished profoundly he had something more to give her . Well , the witches had named him Charming , after all . They had not made him resolute , or valiant , or virtuous . He could not be blamed for his faults ; he was as they had created him . He rolled over and went to sleep . He woke with a brilliant idea . Perhaps her enchantment could be broken . He could talk to his father 's priests , he could even find the wise women who had blessed him . Yarrow might still be alive ; perhaps she had arranged for him to find the princess so that he could cure her . And then , when he had managed to roll back the years , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... The thought made him queasy . How could he love her when he had seen her in old age ? He shrugged ; he would answer that question when he came to it . A harsh cry came from one of the rooms . She had woken up . He stood and hurried down the hall . His journey home was as uneventful as the ride outward . The princess either slept or stared ahead of her without speaking . She broke her silence only once , when they came to another inn and Charming lifted her from the cart . " I can walk , you know , " she said . " Are you certain ? " he asked . " Of course I 'm certain . Put me down , you oaf . " He set her carefully on her feet . She took a few steps and then cried out in pain . He lifted her in his arms again . " Put me down ! " she said . " This is all your fault , for waking me up . I hate you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't walk . But the childish words coming from the ancient face shocked him , and he had to remind himself that despite what she looked like she was still a young woman . When Charming reached the castle he thought briefly of his parents and how worried they must be , but instead of going to them he took the woman to the royal physician 's chambers . " I ca n't do much for her , " the physician said , after Charming had related his story and he had studied the princess a while . " I can only ease her hurts until she dies . She has but a few weeks to live , I think . " " What if I can undo the spell that put her to sleep ? " Charming asked . " You ca n't undo time , my lad , " the other man said . He opened several of the tiny drawers where he kept his herbs and powders and began to mix a potion . The physician 's words made little impression on Charming ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents , and after they had exclaimed in relief over his return he asked them about the wise women of the kingdom . The queen did not remember any of them , or so she said ; Charming had always thought she knew more than she showed . But the king took him to the Hall of Records and brought out an ancient parchment with their names and vague directions to where they lived . Charming tried to find Yarrow first , but the forest was wild and the roads confusing , and the landmarks seemed to have changed over the years . He found the others more easily , or at least their houses ; Betony and some of the others had died in the years since his birth . Anise was still alive , though she no longer wore the changing colors his father had told him about . She invited him into the cottage and insisted he take the most comfortable chair . The room was filled with hanging plants , and an orange cat slept curled up on a blanket . Light made dappled patterns on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anise served him tea and cinnamon bread and exclaimed over how much he had changed since he was a baby . " I wanted to talk to you about that day , " he said . " When you all came and blessed me . " She listened carefully while he recounted his story . " I do n't know any enchantment like that , " she said when he had finished . " Well , since I blessed you at your birth I 've had less and less to do with magic . What is a spell , after all ? Plant a seed and you make a flower . Strike a spark and you create fire . Are these spells ? When girls come to me for love charms I tell them to comb their hair differently , and it seems to work just as well . Perhaps the whole world is an enchantment , seen the right way . " " Do you know where Yarrow lives ? " he asked . " I have n't thought of her in years , " Anise said . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He thanked her , and she gave him a fresh-baked loaf of the bread to take with him on his travels . As he rode away from her cottage he mulled over the odd things she had said . He thought that the truth was just the opposite , that the world needed more magic , not less . He could have used a great many more blessings at his birth , though he had been too polite to say so . Finally he had tracked down all the living witches except Yarrow , and had spoken to all his father 's priests . No one knew how to break the enchantment ; a few of them told him frankly that his quest was impossible . To everyone 's surprise the princess did not die after a few weeks but continued on weakly from one day to the next . The physician told Charming that she seemed less devastated by her enchantment as time went on . " She 'll never accept it , of course , " he said . " But she might not be so angry when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling him all this ; the physician wanted him to visit the sickroom . But that , he knew , he could not do . He did not have the courage to face her ; he could barely stand to think about her , disfigured by age and illness . More than that , he felt responsible for her somehow , felt that , as she had said , it was all his fault . No , he would find a way to break the enchantment . He would visit her only then , when he could bring her the glad news . A year passed . His friends had stopped asking him to go drinking or dancing with them ; among themselves they considered him mad , perhaps ensorcelled himself . They had never known him to pursue anything with such urgency . And still the princess continued to live , her bony ribcage rising and falling with each difficult breath . The summer was a hard one , much worse than last year . A drought had come to the land , withering the crops , and a horde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king worked day and night , talking to his priests , working out ways to divert water , bargaining with nearby kingdoms for grain . Charming barely saw him . But he would not have seen him in any case ; he spent all his time away from the castle . He rode far and wide , looking for wise men and women or searching the twisting paths of the forest for Yarrow . In the countryside he saw field after field of dead crops . The castle still had a storehouse of grain , and Charming shared as much of his food as he could with the hungry folk he met on his travels . He had never seen the people of the kingdom so wretched , and he tried again and again to think of ways to help them . There was nothing he could do , though , and he returned to the task that had been given to him , the breaking of the spell . Summer became autumn , and then winter . Charming rode out unprepared for the cold and caught a chill . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt anxious to be on his way ; every day he delayed could be the day the princess died . He spent long dreamy days in the sickroom . The floor was old scuffed wood , the walls whitewashed , the bed clean and comfortable . Candles burned ; herbs smoldered in pots in the corners . The room had a window but he never rose to look out of it , - instead he followed the progress of the sun by watching its light move slowly across the floor and up the opposite wall . He had strange fever dreams , where princesses and priests , children and cats and forests all combined into one great story . In these dreams he seemed to understand everything , seemed to hold the answer to all his questions , but when he awoke all his insights slipped away . One day he heard laughter coming from another room . The physician said something , and an old woman answered . No , not an old woman . The princess . He sat up , his heart pounding . His first thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that he lay just down the hall from her . He fell back and tried to calm himself . He did not have to see her ; he would leave the sickroom in a few days and never come back .... But she was laughing , he thought . What did she have to laugh about ? The physician came into his room . " Was that - were you talking to the princess ? " Charming asked , though he was certain he had recognized the voice . " Yes , " the physician said . . " How is she ? " " She 's doing quite well . " " Well ? " he said , feeling a sudden hope . " Do you mean - have you broken the enchantment ? " " No , of course not . The enchantment that holds her ca n't be broken , not by magic or medicine . No , I mean that she cries less , and sometimes she even laughs . " " Why was she laughing ? " The physician studied him . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend a few minutes with her . " Charming shook his head . He felt ill , as though his fever had returned . And he hated himself for his cowardice in front of the other man , though he knew that no one had ever expected more from him . He would rest , be as charming to the physician as ever , and then leave the sickroom for good . He continued to hear the conversations between the two . In one of them the princess laughed again , and he thought about walking down the hall and knocking on her door . He knew how to enter a room , at least ; he had spent hours practicing an offhanded manner that looked simple but was in fact terribly difficult . But in the next moment she began to sob , and the physician lowered his voice and spoke in soothing tones , and he sat in his bed and felt bile come into his throat . Finally the physician told him he was well enough to leave . He dressed in the clothes he had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood there a while , uncertain . To his disgust he was trembling slightly . He could go to the left and visit the princess , or to the right and continue as he had been , riding after the least rumor of a healer or wise woman and ignoring everything else . Without letting himself think about it he turned left . He walked up to the door and knocked . " Come in , " a voice said . He opened the door and went inside . The room was dim , and he tripped over something on the floor . A graceful entrance indeed , he thought , disgusted with himself . " Oh , " the woman said . " It 's you . I thought it was the physician . " " No , " he said . His eyes adjusted to the light , and he could see her better now . She was a little less thin , and her hair was combed and her eyes more alert , but she still looked like a ruin of a woman , a dried-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mind formed a courteous phrase about how well she seemed , but the words stuck in his throat . " I came to see how you were , " he said . " How did you expect me to be ? " she asked . A good question . He struggled on . " Are you - are you resting comfortably ? " She did not answer . Charming , who had talked easily to kings and diplomats and serving maids , could not think of a single thing to say . The silence grew intolerable . There had never been an empty moment in any of his conversations ; he had always rushed to fill them with jokes and news and gossip . He blurted the first thing that came to mind . " Do you still hate me ? " " What ? " She had been drifting , he realized , might not have even heard his first question . " You told me you hated me once . It was one of the first things you said to me . " " Oh . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She struggled to concentrate . " Why are you here ? " sheasked . " The true reason , this time .

" People make allowances for you if they think you 'll die at any moment . " " But I did wonder about you . I think about you every day , every moment . I 've been very busy , though - I 'm looking for a way to break your enchantment . " She laughed again , louder . The laugh turned into a cough , which went on and on . " Can you turn back time ?

If you 'd bothered to talk to me I would have said that your quest is hopeless , that I would much rather have you pass the time with me , the way we 're doing now . " " You ca n't believe that . " " Maybe at first I did n't . But I 've come to realize that I will never be free of this curse , that I 'm trapped in this horrible body - " " You do n't know that , " he said . She did n't answer . He pressed his advantage , speaking into the silence . " And what did you mean when you said that I was avoiding you ? I 'm under no obligation to visit you at all . " " That 's true . But you do seem to be avoiding me , or avoiding something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful conversation , head it toward a familiar road . " Hard work , probably , " he said . He smiled his most engaging smile , then wondered if she could see it with her ruined eyes . " That 's what my father says , anyway . " " He does ? " she asked . She had caught his mood , thank the gods . " And does he have any reason for this opinion ? " " Quite a few reasons , actually . " Charming realized he was standing , and he took a seat near the bed and lounged in it , trying to look relaxed . " I 'm appalled at the amount of work it takes to run the kingdom . I told my father I would hire men to do the work for me , and he said that looking after those men was most of the work . " " My father said something similar , " she said . " He did n't expect me to take over the kingdom when he died , though . When I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall into an enchanted sleep , and that I would be rescued by a prince . A handsome prince , actually . " " Really ? " he said , feeling irrationally pleased . He hurried on . " But she did n't tell you that you would age during your sleep ? " " No . " " Why did she do this to you ? " " My father cut down the forest where she lived . He said he had to , that people needed to get from one town to another , that thieves lived in the forest .... I ca n't help but wonder if it was truly necessary . And if he would have done it had he known what would happen . " " Of course he would n't have . " " No , probably not . He 's - he could be cruel , though , especially when someone stood in his way . Not at all like your father . " " You 've met my father ? " " And your mother . Why are you so surprised ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're good people , " he said , realizing it only then . He had had little to compare them to . The princess yawned , then winced with some pain . " I 'm afraid I tire easily , " she said . " I 'm truly sorry , my lady . I was n't thinking . I 've had a wonderful time - can I see you again ? " She said nothing . He saw that he had hurt her , but how ? Perhaps it was when he called the visit wonderful , though any gentleman would have said the same ; he certainly had n't been mocking her . And he realized to his surprise that he had enjoyed himself , especially at the end ; he had almost forgotten what she looked like . " Of course , " she said finally , and he stood and left her . He saw the princess every few days . He grew used to her forthright conversation , and even took some pleasure in it ; no one in the castle had ever spoken so boldly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had not accepted her fate , but in a year and a half she had found a way to endure . Her courage amazed him ; he knew that he himself could never have been so brave . " I heard what became of my father , and of my mother , " she said one day . She looked at him keenly with her one good eye , as if she expected him to care so little that he would change the subject . " Really ? What ? " " They stayed in the castle for several years , trying to find someone to break the witch 's spell . But no one could , and eventually they began to fear that they would fall under the same enchantment . I do n't know why - the witch had n't cursed anyone but me. see , here 's where I pricked my finger . " She held out her hand toward Charming . He nodded , though he could see nothing but her knobs and veins . " I suppose people fear what they do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she talking about him ? No , it was not her way to speak in hints ; she came out and said what she thought . " So the entire village moved . They found a place a good distance away , and they cleared the land for crops and built a new castle . But nothing they did prospered , and the village disappeared . They tell me that some folks moved again , but most of them seem to have died . Including - " She faltered here . " Including my father and mother . " She began to cry . " I 'm sorry , " he said , feeling inadequate . It was a feeling he often had around her . " I do n't know why I 'm crying , " she said . " I did n't even like my father very much . Maybe that 's why , because I never got to tell him so . " The idea that children could dislike their parents shocked him . " Maybe , " he said . " Thank you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For letting me talk . For your understanding . " " I do n't understand anything , my lady . " He stopped , feeling the worst sort of idiot . He should not have said that ; he should have pretended to knowledge , comforted her with illusions . He was good at lies , the gods knew ; he had told them all his life . But he realized uncomfortably that he could not lie to her . Perhaps he did not want to waste what little time she had left with empty phrases . Or perhaps her fierce honesty compelled the same from him . He searched his mind for something to say , a few words that would be kind but not dishonest . They sat for a long moment in silence . " I am trying to understand , " he said finally . She looked drained , and he saw that he had tired her once again . " Thank you , " she murmured , and closed her eyes . " Good night , my lady , " he said . HE STILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle less and less often . The drought continued through the winter and into spring , - creeks and rivers dried up and the ground was nearly too hard to plow . In the taverns and inns the farmers spoke of a disastrous harvest , of surplus grain gone and nothing with which to replace it . In one village he saw a crowd assembled in the village square , listening intently while a man spoke and gestured in front of them . Charming reined in his horse and dismounted and joined them . He could make nothing of the man 's speech ; it was mostly nonsense . The man mentioned ancient practices and promises unkept ; if the royal family would follow tradition , he said , shaking his fist , the rain would come and the drought would end . Charming frowned and rode on . He would have to tell his father about this ; when the common folk got strange ideas in their heads they could become dangerous . He went to his father 's study when he returned . " What exactly did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it matter ? " Charming said . " Something ridiculous . You have to make some sacrifice so the rains will come again . " " Was he talking about me or the royal family ? " " The family , I think . " Charming laughed . " What - are you saying that I have to sacrifice something ? Should I cut my hair and walk around in rags ? " " It 's not a joke . There are old traditions - the priests have been telling me about them . " " What traditions ? " " They 're not certain . We 've been prosperous for so long that most of these rituals have been lost . The land has to be renewed , made fertile , there has to be some sort of marriage .... " The prince laughed again . " With the land ? How exactly does one take the land to bed ? " " Do n't be flippant about this , " the king said angrily . " I 'm going to see my priests now . Do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come along . He started to say so , then stopped , overwhelmed by an idea so terrible that for a moment he could n't breathe . His heart suddenly beat louder , drowning out all other sound . " No , " he said finally . The king nodded , as if he expected no more from his son . When the king had gone Charming went to a bay window . There was a window seat , but he stood and looked out at the castle entrance . A long line of people stood there , most dressed in rags and covered in dust from the road . They had traveled a long way to petition the king for grain , he knew , and he knew as well that there was no more grain to give them . He sat and forced himself to think about the princess . He had come to like her , to look forward to their time together . The horror she had been through had somehow made her wise , wiser even than the witches he had spoken to along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty , easy conversations he had had with his old friends ; these friends now seemed like mirrors , showing him whatever he wanted to see . Compared to them the princess was real , solid , the world that lay beyond the mirror . But he had never touched her . Once or twice he had wanted to , had nearly rested his hand on hers to comfort her , but something within him had cringed at the thought . How could he .. . would he be able to .... For he would have to marry her . That was what the man in the village square had meant , and his father 's priests , and what Yarrow had prophesied . She was the land , withered and dried , and he was the ruler who would make her fertile again . He had no choice in this , he knew . His father could not do it ; his father was already married . And he was coming to understand that the king , or the king 's son , served the people ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could not do things just because you had the power to do them ; you could not chop down a forest without thinking of the consequences . He should go , then , and ask for her hand . But he could not move , and he cast around desperately for a way to avoid his duty . He could say nothing , and the land would continue to sicken and die . Or he could get one of his friends to marry her ; perhaps a substitute would work just as well . He sat by the window for a long time , watching as the sun set beyond the houses and streets and squares of the city . Finally he came to the end of his excuses . He stood , took a lamp from the wall , and went to the princess 's sickroom . He knocked but there was no answer . She must be asleep , then . His question could not wait , - he opened the door . She stirred . He felt a mad reckless laugh rise within him ; surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you marry me ? " he asked . " What ? " she said , struggling to come awake . " I 've come to ask for your hand , " he said . The lamp shone full on her face and he moved it away quickly , to one of the corners . " Are you drunk ? Or did one of your friends put you up to this ? " " What ? No , I want to marry you . " " No you do n't . " " Yes , truly- " " Get out . Get out and do n't come back until you 're sober . Better yet , do n't come back at all . They told me you were a fool , but I did n't see it . Now it looks as if they were right all along . " " No , listen . Please listen to me . The priests say that someone from the royal family has to wed the land , to make the land fertile again . And so I thought- " " You thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barren .... " " No , " he said . " I mean yes , I think you might be the land . And if we wed , well , the land might be renewed . And you might be renewed as well , you might regain your youth .... " That last was a lie , he realized . Somewhere in his long quest he had stopped believing he could find a way to cure her . He trailed off , unable to continue . " I do n't want to marry you , " she said . " Why not ? " She laughed . " No one has ever refused you anything , have they ? You look so puzzled . How could she possibly turn me down , you 're thinking . Who else could she get to marry her ? " She had read his mind again . It was hopeless , the whole thing-he had not counted on her pigheadedness . He would turn around and go , never come back .... No , he would n't . " The land has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hunger , there 's no more grain in the storehouses .... You have to help us , whatever you think of me . Please . I beg you . " She laughed again , softer this time . " Prince Charming is begging me . If only your youthful conquests could see you now . " Whatever he said now would be the wrong thing . He held his breath , " praying to gods he only vaguely remembered . " Do you love me ? " she asked . " I - " He met her gaze squarely , the good eye and the damaged one . " No , I do n't . I 'm sorry . I like you very much , though . " " I 've come to love you , I 'm afraid , " she said . Her mouth crooked in a smile . " Well , everyone has to , do n't they ? You 're so charming . I tried not to , but I could n't help it . Even when you were so - so inept , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They why wo n't you marry me ? " She said nothing . " I do n't understand . What do you want from me ? " " Tell me you 'll never hurt me . " " But I ca n't lie to you ! " he said in frustration . " How can I keep from hurting you if I have to tell you the truth ? " " Do n't you see ? " she said . " It 's the lies that cause me pain . " His parents were the only witnesses at the wedding . His mother cried , though for reasons other than the traditional ones . She had tried to talk him out of the marriage ; what if ; she said , the wretched woman did n't die for years ? Already she had lived far longer than anyone expected . What about Charming 's duty to provide heirs for the kingdom ? Charming had shrugged . He did not think the princess could live much longer , but whatever happened he knew he would stay with her until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said nothing , but Charming would never forget the look of surprise that had appeared on his face . Now the priests were asking him to kiss his bride . He did , remembering the first time in the deserted tower . The ceremony ended . No one applauded , as was the custom ; his parents and the priests murmured a few words of congratulations and left , Charming picked up his bride - she had grown no heavier in the years - and carried her to his rooms . He laid her on the bed . " Careful , " she said , and he remembered that she had told him that she had never had a lover , that her father had guarded her close . Gently , very gently , he undid her dress . He ran his hands over her dry flesh , her shriveled breasts . " Do n't worry , " he said . " I promised I would n't hurt you . " Outside , rain pattered against the window . <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
