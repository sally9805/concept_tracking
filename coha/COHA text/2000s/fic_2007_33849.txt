Saturday , June 20 National Weapons Alliance Rally Houston , Texas Fifty-two years ago , at the tender age of nine , Dale Allen Stubbs fell head over heels in love . He simply could n't help himself . The object of his affection was slender and hard , blessed with understated curves that begged for the caress of his young hand . It was a bolt-action Remington .22 given to him by his grandfather Atticus Stubbs on Dale 's birthday . Christ , what a gun ! Oil-finished walnut stock . A twenty-inch barrel with the same blue-black sheen as a raven 's wing . A true thing of beauty . Stubbs ' palms were sweaty with anticipation the first time he cradled that marvelous weapon . For the first week or so , he actually slept with it , the barrel rising up between his legs , little Dale having no understanding of the Freudian implications . Now , half a century later , the white-hot love affair continued , though Stubbs was by no means monogamous . He 'd amassed an arsenal over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-powder muzzleloaders , antique flintlocks and muskets-all housed inside twin burglarproof safes , with a certified fire-protection rating of more than sixteen hundred degrees . Had to protect his babies , you know . Of course , like a father with many children , he had his favorites . His Winchester Model 70 , a pre-1964specimen , chambered in .375 H &H; Magnum . His L. C. Smith side-by-side twelve-gauge with rear oval lock plates , manufactured in 1898 . Monogram grade . Extremely rare . And the centerpiece of his collection-a pair of Colt Model 1849 pocket percussion revolvers , inscribed to Major C. Smith . Yes , he loved each and every one . A lot . More than his six-bedroom home with its state-of-the-art security system . More than Dexter , his five-thousand-dollar bird dog . More than his brand-new fully loaded Chevrolet crew-cab pickup . Yes , even more than sex-with Margie , his wife of twenty-five years , or with Tricia , his twenty-four-year-old secretary , who captured Stubbs ' heart when he discovered that she carried a snubnose .38 in her handbag . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' passion more than guns was speaking to other people who held the same convictions he did . Preaching the gospel of Truth gave him a sense of satisfaction more profound than dropping a charging Cape buffalo ( which he had done on three separate occasions ) . Now , as he strutted onto the dais , preparing to address a crowd of four thousand-true patriots , every last one of them-Stubbs was feeling an all-time high . Adrenaline flowed through his heart like water through a hose . The audience rose to its feet , clapping and cheering wildly . It was amazing , really , he thought . A simple country boy had managed to reach dizzying heights , turning his fondness for guns into not just a lucrative career but a higher calling . He was making a difference in the world , by God . He was president of the Texas chapter of the National Weapons Alliance , the most powerful lobbying organization in the world . As such , he lived for moments like this . As the applause slowly ebbed , Stubbs adjusted the microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important one , and Stubbs was up to the task . Using the deepest , most charismatic voice he could muster , he said , " I wan na welcome y'all to Houston . . . where great Americans still recognize the value of freedom ! " The crowd went berserk . Right on cue , thousands of red , white , and blue balloons dropped from the rafters . Someone backstage cranked the music to a deafening level . Men in Stetsons proudly waved flags and banners . The pandemonium lasted a full minute . Stubbs simply waited , beaming , enjoying every last moment of it . Finally , just as the auditorium began to settle down , a buxom blond girl wearing minuscule shorts , a tight NWA T-shirt , and a cowboy hat yelled , " We love you , Dale ! " " I love you , too , sweetheart , " Dale replied cheerfully . That elicited a booming round of good-natured laughter , followed by more hearty applause . " In fact , I love all of you , " Stubbs continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Each and every one of you is a soldier in the battle to keep our great country strong . " Another eruption , almost as long as the first . He expected it ; he 'd carefully crafted his speech to draw reactions at key moments . You had to control the audience , just as you controlled your pacing and your content . Sometimes , though , you needed a little help , and that 's why Stubbs had asked one of his assistants to plant the blond girl in the third row . Just a little parlor trick to get him off on the right foot . Now Stubbs raised one hand , palm outward , and the audience grew silent . It was as impressive as Moses parting the Red Sea . " It 's apparent that we 're all in a great mood this morning , and for good reason . The National Weapons Alliance , I 'm proud to say , is stronger today than it has ever been . Granted , we 've faced treachery on many fronts in the past decade . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurp the power of the American people . " Boos all around . Stubbs nodded sympathetically . " More recently , misguided cities and counties , and even a few states , tried to sue the gun manufacturers out of existence . But were we daunted or discouraged or defeated ? No sir ! We did what our daddies would 've done . We persevered ! We fought back , using the second most effective weapon we have : our God-given right to vote . From state capitals around the nation , all the way to Washington , our voice was heard as one-and that voice said the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed ! " The audience sprang to its feet . A standing ovation ! Quoting the Second Amendment was always a surefire winner . This outbreak was the longest one yet ! Stubbs basked in the glow and waited for the calm before he proceeded . " Now we are in a position to ensure liberty for generations to come , for our children and our grandchildren . We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , the common citizens , must always remain vigilant as we stand guard against tyranny . He 's one of us , my friends , and you have yourselves to thank because you put him there ! " Applause for ten seconds . About what Stubbs had expected because , let 's face it , the president did have certain flaws . His intelligence was questionable . His diplomatic skills were suspect . He was often nervous and clumsy in front of a camera . Plus , to get picky , he did n't even have a gun rack in the truck he used on his ranch . What kind of message did that send ? Ah , well , you did your best with what you had , and one of Stubbs ' jobs was to make the NWA 's strengths appear indomitable . " But , as we have all learned over the years , we can not become complacent . We can not rest on our laurels and our accomplishments . The antigun zealots and the liberal media are quick to jump on even the smallest crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springfield , Massachusetts , where one of our members-Zelda Grimby , a retired algebra teacher-mistakenly thought her postman was a burglar and shot him in the groin . Did the reporters mention that Zelda was fully licensed to own a handgun ? No , they did not . Did they mention that Zelda lived in a high-crime area ? Somehow they overlooked that . They focused solely on the fact that the mail carrier lost a testicle , and the second one was badly damaged . Yes , it 's unlikely that he 'll ever father children , but " - Stubbs paused for effect , then came back stronger than ever- " I 'd say that 's a small price to pay for a strong and well-armed republic ! " Wild cheering proved that Stubbs was right . He had the audience eating out of his hand . Time to wrap this up and get out on a high note . Move on to the barbecue and a cold beer . " The point is , we must keep up the good fight , and that is the reason we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unified support for a man who , with our help , will be elected the next governor of the state of Texas . I 'm speaking of a man who will push to fully expand our Second Amendment rights , making it legal for law-abiding citizens to carry a concealed weapon anywhere in Texas without a permit . I 'm referring to a good friend of mine by the name of Congressman Glenn Andrew Dobbins ! " This was the moment the crowd had been waiting for . They quickly began a chant : Daw-bins ! Daw-bins ! Daw-bins ! They waved placards and hand-painted signs . Khaki-clad men kissed khaki-clad women with joyous exuberance . Somewhere in the back , someone played " Deep in the Heart of Texas " very poorly on a trombone . After a minute , Stubbs tried one of his usual settle-down gestures , but even that did n't work . He simply had to wait it out , and he did n't mind at all . If this was any indication , the NWA 's candidate was a shoo-in come November . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Unfortunately , " Stubbs said , " Congressman Dobbins was unable to join us today . But as you know , this is only the first of many rallies to be held in the next few months . Fort Worth . San Antonio . Midland . Abilene . Not Austin , thank you very much . " Stubbs waited for the chuckles that line merited , and he was amply rewarded . No , Austin , the liberal bastion of Texas , would not be hosting an NWA rally . No way . Not a city that had more anti-gunners than the remainder of the state combined . The rest of Texas-that 's where the NWA intended to spread its message . " In fact , two weeks from today , " he said , " on Independence Day , we 'll be convening in the heartland of our state . . . in Blanco County , just outside Johnson City , and I know Congressman Dobbins intends to be there to thank each of you for your support . Because make no mistake-it is you , the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our organization ! " Pure pandering , but they ate it up . Audience members slapped each other 's backs and exchanged high fives . " Speaking of the Blanco County rally , " Stubbs said , switching to a folksy delivery for a moment , " I have a very special announcement to make , and this just tickles me to death . " He paused again to build the drama , studying the crowd with what was meant to come across as genuine affection . " We 've been holding the location of the rally back as a surprise , and now I can share it with you . " A buzz was starting to build . This was going to be big , Stubbs had no doubt of that . " I 'm pleased to say that it will take place at a ranch owned by-hold on to your hats , friends ! - none other than our newest spokesman , star of our latest radio and television ads , country music superstar Mitch Campbell ! " The audience responded with an outburst unlike any Stubbs had ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by comparison . Stubbs did his best to speak over the uproar . " Mitch Campbell , I think we 'd all agree , is a fine representative for the NWA . His smash-hit song My Cold , Dead Hands ' has brought in a quarter million new members nationally in the last six months alone ! " Was anyone even listening at this point ? It was hard to tell above the melee . " Mitch offers a powerful new voice for responsible gun ownership ! " Lusty female shrieks ascended to the heavens . " He is a man of ethics ! " Men whistled and stomped and shot imaginary pistols into the air . " A man of virtue ! " An overweight woman near the front swooned and cracked her head on a speaker assembly . " A man of strong moral fiber and good old-fashioned Christian values ! " The hall was now a full-on madhouse . " The kind of man the NWA can be proud to call its own ! " The crowd had taken up a new chant-Campbell ! Campbell ! Campbell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to enter its golden age .
