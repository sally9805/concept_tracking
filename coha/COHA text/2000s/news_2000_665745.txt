But Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa never wrapped Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak 's hand in his own during weeklong talks in Shepherdstown , West Virginia , that recessed on Monday without any agreements .

" The INS has no plans to do any enforcement action on Elian , " INS spokesman Mike Gilhooly said . " We have no plans to change the custody arrangement of him being with his Miami family . " Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez issued a temporary protective order so she can hear arguments filed by Elian 's Miami relatives , who are seeking temporary custody .
