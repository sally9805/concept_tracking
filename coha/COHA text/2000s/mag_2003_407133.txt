After two decades of outrageous and cutling-edge style , the ultimate pop-culture icon still manages to keep us guessing . Here , Madonna 's inner fashion circle reveals her style secrets // Photographed by Regan Cameron From epitomizing the ' ' 80s in fingerless lace gloves , a floppy hair bow , rubber bracelets and ragged-edged miniskirts to capturing the mood of today with a ladylike Celine double-breasted cashmere coat and a top-handle Louis Vuitton Murakami bag , one thing about Madonna 's style remains constant : It 's dynamic-and continually surprises and influences the way we think about dressing . " Even when she rebels against fashion , it becomes fashion , " says her longtime friend and collaborator , designer Jean Paul Gaultier . " She 's like a little gamine who likes to play . Back in the ' ' 80s , I was producing the pointed bra in Paris ; she was wearing the look in New York , adding lots of jewelry like crosses and making it her own . " It has been 20 years since Madonna caught our eye . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced the world to the underground East Village punk style , took lingerie out of the bedroom and into the street , toyed with the Marilyn Monroe image of bombshell glamour and blurred the line between masculinity and femininity . And just when you thought the artist could n't come up with another look , she morphed her way through a whole new series of styles : flamenco , geisha , and hip-hop ( fur coat , gold chains and all ) . Madonna repeatedly defines the times . " Madonna has always been provocative in everything she does . She has constantly evolved , never scared to take risks , " say Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana . " She has embraced fashion throughout her entire career . Her ability to move forward with confidence is very inspiring . " Stella McCartney ( who did her wedding ensemble in 2000 ) agrees : " She kicks ass . She runs her own business , writes her own songs , is a great mother , great wife , and can put her legs behind her neck . " According to Arianne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1997 , Madonna does n't have time to follow the fashion world too closely . " People think her style is premeditated , but it 's not . She has a great wardrobe , but she 's actually quite modest , " says Phillips . " Madonna is just like any normal person-she 's very practical . I would imagine that the choices she makes every morning have to do with what she has to do that day , her mood or the weather . " Madonna may not overthink her day-to-day wardrobe , but her influence is endless . " It 's not just that she 's gorgeous or that she has a way of wearing clothes that is great . She thinks-she has a brain . Others worry about marketing or what people will think , but Madonna does n't care . She 's herself . And best of all , she 's daring , " says Donatella Versace of the star , who appeared in two of the house 's 1995 ad campaigns . Aside from consistently supporting her designer friends , she has helped the careers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theyskens ' designs in 1998 ( he was barely out of his teens then ) and wore Rick Owens years ago , when he was under the radar . Recently , she stepped out in a ' ' 40s-style tweed wrap coat and had everyone wondering who Louis Verdad was-turns out he is a new L.A. designer . " She 's a real supporter of independents . People want to see something unique on her , " says Phillips . However , in the spirit of keeping her public on their toes , she has gone more mainstream of late and loves the glamour of Tom Ford 's fall collection for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche , wearing two of the dresses in her video for " Hollywood . " How can we blame her ? Says Phillips , " She 's a true girl 's girl . " You can bet on this : We have n't seen the last of Madonna 's fashion guises . Stay tuned for the next 20 years .
