keeping them healthy Headnote Protect your child from the viruses , bugbites , and other ailments that can wreck her warm-weather fun . // You probably do n't worry about your kids ' spring fever ; after months of being bundled up so they can barely move , of course they deserve to run around like crazy outside . But real fevers in spring ? That 's not at all what the season is supposed to be about ( neither are sniffles , coughs , and other symptoms ) . But they do strike  --  and often . Here 's what you need to know to combat common springtime ailments ( including strep and chicken pox ... who knew they loved warm weather ? ) so your children can stay ready to play . SORE-THROAT SURPRISE If strep took up residence in your kids ' throats during the winter , you may be banking on springtime to send the germs packing . Sorry : Group A streptococcal bacteria stay active for months , and strep cases can peak right around this time , says Stanford Shulman , M.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago . So if your school  --  age child complains of a sore throat  --  perhaps with fever , nausea , and swollen glands-do n't assume it 's just some little bug and take a wait-and-see approach for more than a day , especially since untreated strep can lead to a more dangerous ailment , rheumatic fever . When your kid says her throat hurts , call your doctor and see if a strep test is recommended . If it 's positive , get set to administer a course of amoxicillin ( you know , the bubble-gum-pink stuff ) or another antibiotic ; and be sure she takes the entire prescribed course , even if symptoms disappear in a couple of days , so all the bacteria are killed off . Worth considering : Some doctors recommend chucking your sick kid 's toothbrush a day or two into the treatment . This may help the therapy work by ensuring that your child does n't reinfect herself with bacteria that linger on the toothbrush . WHEN EATING EQUALS " OUCH ! " Here 's a medical mystery for you : Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refuses to eat . You peek into his mouth and-yecch  --  see some small blisters or ulcers . What 's going on ? He has hand , foot and mouth disease , an illness ( caused by enteroviruses , such as the Coxsackie virus ) that appears in increasing numbers of people in the spring . The ailment gets its name from the painful blisters it causes on the tongue , gums , and insides of the cheeks and from the rash it can trigger on the palms and the soles of the feet . While the illness is commonest among preschoolers , it can hit at any age . " Several viruses cause hand , foot and mouth , which means it 's possible to get it more than once  --  including in adulthood , " explains Julia McMillan , M.D. , professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore . How to help a kid who comes down with this highly icky illness ? Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen soothe blistered mouths , as can Anbesol and other numbing medications . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be sure to avoid acidic foods and drinks ( such as oranges , tomato sauce , lemonade ) ; they only make the pain of the oral sores worse . If your child has the hand and foot rash , any itching is usually so mild that no treatment is needed . NOW TO QUIET NONSTOP SNEEZING If your child ca n't seem to stop sneezing and snuffling this time of year , do n't just keep the tissues coming . There 's a good chance the symptoms are due to the pollen being pumped out by trees , grass , and other plants . About 20 percent of children have allergies , according to Robert Wood , M.D. , director of pediatric allergy clinics at Johns Hopkins , and spring is prime time for this problem . Seasonal allergies-also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis-cause sneezing , a runny nose , itchy eyes , and coughing . " Hay fever is n't harmful , but it can be miserable enough to keep a kid out of school , " says Wood . How do you know your kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illness 's duration . " Symptoms that linger for ten or more days but do n't worsen usually signal allergies , " says Wood . " Itchy eyes are another clue that it 's probably not a cold you 're dealing with . " Allergies are most often seen in children aged 3 and older ( it takes a season or two of exposure for allergies to build ) , and especially in those with an allergic parent . While over-the-counter antihistamines are fine for occasional mild symptoms , kids who really feel awful or are made too drowsy by these medications should be seen by your pediatrician or family practitioner , who may in turn recommend an allergist . " With all the effective medications available , there 's no reason your child should suffer or be stuck inside , " says Wood . And-whew-the injections common when we were kids are n't the usual course of treatment in the twenty-first century . Instead , starting a week or two before allergy season begins , your child can use an OTC cromolyn sodium nasal spray ( such as NasalCrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her body from overreacting to allergens . ( To find out when pollen counts are highest in your area , check the Allergy Alerts at www.pollen.com . ) WONDER WHAT THOSE RED SPOTS ARE ? Ever notice how many parents tell you stories about their kids developing chicken pox over spring break ? That 's because the varicella virus , which causes chicken pox , emerges in late winter ( which is when most people think it 's " in season " ) but actually peaks in the spring . Your best defense , regardless of what month it is : the vaccine . Even though it 's been available for seven years , an estimated 3 million kids aged 6 to 12 have n't received it , according to the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners . If yours has n't been vaccinated , consider having it done : " What many parents overlook is that chicken pox can be so uncomfortable , causing fever and headache along with the itchiness , and kids tend to feel sicker the older they get , " says McMillan . The vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaccinated kids who do get sick have much milder symptoms than they would otherwise ( we 're talking a mere 50 spots versus the usual 250 to 300 ) . If you have n't had your child vaccinated and you notice a telltale spot or two , call your doctor right away . The prescription medication acyclovir , an antiviral drug , can reduce symptoms ( kids will have fewer eruptions and a lower fever ) and cut the length of the illness by a couple of days-provided it 's given early , ideally within 24 hours of the onset of the illness . THE GREAT OUTDOORS DANGER As the weather warms up and kids head outdoors , bugs are inevitably their companions . The ones you need to worry about are disease-carrying ticks : Depending on where you live , your kids may be at risk for Rocky Mountain spotted fever ( spread by wood ticks , dog ticks , and lone star ticks in the South Atlantic , Pacific , and West South Central regions ) or Lyme disease ( transmitted by deer ticks , mainly in southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complications from bites from infected ticks-seizures in the case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever , ongoing joint pain with Lyme disease  --  are rare , but parents should be on the alert for tick bites rather than take a risk . Warding off the little buggers is your best defense if you live in a loaded-with  --  ticks location . If your kids will be in the woods for a while , dress them in light  --  colored clothing with long sleeves and pants ( tucked into their socks , if possible ) so you can tell if a dark tick lands on their clothes , and apply insect repellent containing DEET to exposed areas . At the end of the day , inspect your child 's entire body for ticks . If you find one , pull it out : Studies have found that if a tick is pulled out within 48 to 72 hours , it will not have time to transmit the Lyme disease bacteria , says pediatric epidemiologist Eugene Shapiro of Yale University School of Medicine . How to unlatch the bug ? Swab the area with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to your kid 's skin as you can and pull it straight up and out ( do n't squash it ; that might release bacteria and infect the person who 's pulling , says Jon Abramson , M.D. , chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics ' committee on infectious diseases ) . Apply more alcohol to the site , and then wash your hands . Let 's say you ca n't do the full-body inspection every time your kid comes in from frolicking in the outdoors . Always look for suspicious rashes at bath time ; these may indicate that your child was recently infected . Lyme disease will cause a circular , reddish rash that expands over time and sometimes resembles a bull's-eye ; with Rocky Mountain spotted fever , red spots develop on the legs and spread up the trunk , or develop on the hands and spread up the arms , " says Abramson . Even if your child develops these diseases , antibiotics almost always prevent serious complications . " Only 3 percent of people with recognized tick bites end up with Lyme disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seasons change , you 'll hear these old wives ' tales ... Do n't believe " em ! 1 Do n't let your child sniff flowers ; he 'll get allergies ! Problematic pollens come from trees and grasses , not flowers . " Hay fever is sometimes referred to as rose fever , but that 's a complete misnomer , " says allergist Robert Wood . In fact , a flower , such as a rose , produces a fairly small amount of pollen , but grasses and trees produce millions of grains that get into the air and into the nose and trigger all those symptoms . 2 The change in the weather makes kids ill . Fickle temperatures-chilly today , warm tomorrow-may make it tough to know how to dress your kids , but they 're not hard on their health . " Temperature has nothing to do with the transmission of illness , which usually spreads from one person to another , " says Julia McMillan , M.D. " Incidentally , it 's also untrue that if you go out in the spring rain , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you sick . Not every tick carries bacteria that cause illness . " The proportion of infected ticks varies by area and by the age of the tick , " says pediatric epidemiologist Eugene Shapiro . Fifteen to 25 percent of deer ticks in the nymphal stage ( between larva and adult , and the ones most likely to feast on humans ) are infected , and only about 10 percent of the kinds of ticks that can carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever bacteria actually do . <p>
