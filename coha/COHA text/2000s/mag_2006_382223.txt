Giving someone a shiny silver frame used to be a good way to avoid hunting down a real present . Not anymore . Thanks to the falling price of liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) screens and the fact that everybody has a digital camera , electronic-photo frames are popular gifts this year , ones that could earn you points with loved ones . <P> Do n't just run to the store and buy the first one you see , however . Digital frames still cost plenty , and they 're not all created equal . I checked out four from Philips , Digital Foci , Westinghouse and PanDigital , ranging in price from $180 to $250 . <P> Each frame has a card reader that makes viewing pictures easy . Just slip the memory card out of your camera and into a frame , and your pictures simply appear . But to get the most out of a digital frame , you will probably want to run a slide show , displaying the pictures one at a time . Some frames let you add music to slide shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The biggest difference among the frames I tested was in picture quality . Better LCD screens have vibrant colors and deep black levels ; poorer ones display washed-out colors , and charcoal gray instead of black . In this regard , the Philips 9-in. 9FF2M4 frame ( $250 ) stood out . <P> Another difference among the frames is in how they handle the photos : Is the transition from one photo to the next smooth or jarring ? The Philips and the 8-in . Image Moments from Digital Foci ( $230 ) both handled photos smoothly , with pleasant dissolves from image to image . The Westinghouse ( $200 ) and PanDigital ( $180 ) 8-in. frames , which look suspiciously identical , did n't fare well in either department . <P> If picture quality is your main concern , go with the Philips . Its sturdy design adds to its charm , though it is , compared with others on the market , high in price and low on frills . Digital Foci 's Image Moments costs a bit less and comes with a remote control for photo juggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video playback . You can even change its style to fit your dcor with 10 optional decorative frames ( $20 each at
