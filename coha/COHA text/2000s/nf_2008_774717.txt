Outlier , noun . // out ? li ? er // - , li(-#)r // 1 : something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body // 2 : a statistical observation that is markedly different in value from the others of the sample // 1 . Roseto Valfortore lies one hundred miles southeast of Rome , in the Apennine foothills of the Italian province of Foggia . In the style of medieval villages , the town is organized around a large central square . Facing the square is the Palazzo Marchesale , the palace of the Saggese family , once the great landowner of those parts . An archway to one side leads to a church , the Madonna del Carmine - Our Lady of Mount Carmine . Narrow stone steps run up the hillside , flanked by closely-clustered two-story stone houses with red tile roofs . // For centuries , the paesani of Roseto worked in the marble quarries in the surrounding hills , or cultivated the fields in the terraced valley below , walking four and five miles down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up the hill at night . It was a hard life . The townsfolk were barely literate and desperately poor and without much hope for economic betterment-until word reached Roseto at the end of the nineteenth century of the land of opportunity across the ocean . // In January of 1882 , a group of eleven Rosetans-ten men and one boy-set sail for New York . They spent their first night in America sleeping on the floor of a tavern on Mulberry Street , in Manhattan 's Little Italy . Then they ventured west , ending up finding jobs in a slate quarry ninety miles west of the city in Bangor , Pennsylvania . The following year , fifteen Rosetans left Italy for America , and several members of that group ended up in Bangor as well , joining their compatriots in the slate quarry . Those immigrants , in turn , sent word back to Roseto about the promise of the New World , and soon one group of Rosetans after another packed up their bags and headed for Pennsylvania , until the initial stream of immigrants became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied for passports to America , leaving entire streets of their old village abandoned . // The Rosetans began buying land on a rocky hillside , connected to Bangor only by a steep , rutted wagon path . They built closely clustered two story stone houses , with slate roofs , on narrow streets running up and down the hillside . They built a church and called it Our Lady of Mount Carmel , and named the main street on which it stood Garibaldi Avenue , after the great hero of Italian unification . In the beginning , they called their town New Italy . But they soon changed it to something that seemed more appropriate , given that in the previous decade almost all of them had come from the same village in Italy . They called it Roseto. // In 1896 , a dynamic young priest-Father Pasquale de Nisco-took over at Our Lady of Mount Carmel . De Nisco set up spiritual societies and organized festivals . He encouraged the townsfolk to clear the land , and plant onions , beans , potatoes , melons and fruit trees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds and bulbs . The town came to life . The Rosetans began raising pigs in their backyard , and growing grapes for homemade wine . Schools , a park , a convent and a cemetery were built . Small shops and bakeries and restaurants and bars opened along Garibaldi Avenue . More than a dozen factories sprang up , making blouses for the garment trade . Neighboring Bangor was largely Welsh and English , and the next town over was overwhelmingly German , which meant-given the fractious relationships between the English and Germans and Italians , in those years-that Roseto stayed strictly for Rosetans : if you wandered up and down the streets of Roseto in Pennsylvania , in the first few decades after 1900 , you would have heard only Italian spoken , and not just any Italian but the precise southern , Foggian dialect spoken back in the Italian Roseto . Roseto Pennsylvania was its own tiny , self-sufficient world-all but unknown by the society around it-and may well have remained so but for a man named Stewart Wolf . // Wolf was a physician . He studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school at the University of Oklahoma . He spent summers at a farm he 'd bought in Pennsylvania . His house was not far from Roseto-but that , of course , did n't mean much since Roseto was so much in its own world that you could live one town over and never know much about it . " One of the times when we were up there for the summer-this would have been in the late 1950 's , I was invited to give a talk at the local medical society , " Wolf said , years later , in an interview . " After the talk was over , one of the local doctors invited me to have a beer . And while we were having a drink he said , ' You know , I 've been practicing for seventeen years . I get patients from all over , and I rarely find anyone from Roseto under the age of sixty-five with heart disease . ' " // Wolf was skeptical . This was the 1950 's , years before the advent of cholesterol lowering drugs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemic in the United States . They were the leading cause of death in men under the age of sixty-five . It was impossible to be a doctor , common sense said , and not see heart disease . But Wolf was also a man of deep curiosity . If somebody said that there were no heart attacks in Roseto , he wanted to find out whether that was true . // Wolf approached the mayor of Roseto and told him that his town represented a medical mystery . He enlisted the support of some of his students and colleagues from Oklahoma . They pored over the death certificates from residents of the town , going back as many years as they could . They analyzed physicians ' records . They took medical histories , and constructed family genealogies . " We got busy , " Wolf said . " We decided to do a preliminary study . We started in 1961 . The mayor said-all my sisters are going to help you . He had four sisters . He said , ' You can have the town council room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have council meetings ? ' He said , ' Well , we 'll postpone them for a while . ' The ladies would bring us lunch . We had little booths , where we could take blood , do EKGs . We were there for four weeks . Then I talked with the authorities . They gave us the school for the summer . We invited the entire population of Roseto to be tested . " // The results were astonishing . In Roseto , virtually no one under 55 died of a heart attack , or showed any signs of heart disease . For men over 65 , the death rate from heart disease in Roseto was roughly half that of the United States as a whole . The death rate from all causes in Roseto , in fact , was something like thirty or thirty-five percent lower than it should have been . // Wolf brought in a friend of his , a sociologist from Oklahoma named John Bruhn , to help him . " I hired medical students and sociology grad students as interviewers , and in Roseto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged twenty one and over , " Bruhn remembers . This had happened more than fifty years ago but Bruhn still had a sense of amazement in his voice as he remembered what they found . " There was no suicide , no alcoholism , no drug addiction , and very little crime . They did n't have anyone on welfare . Then we looked at peptic ulcers . They did n't have any of those either . These people were dying of old age . That 's it . " // Wolf 's profession had a name for a place like Roseto-a place that lay outside everyday experience , where the normal rules did not apply . Roseto was an outlier. // 2 . Wolf 's first thought was that the Rosetans must have held on to some dietary practices from the old world that left them healthier than other Americans . But he quickly realized that was n't true . The Rosetans were cooking with lard , instead of the much healthier olive oil they used back in Italy . Pizza in Italy was a thin crust with salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions . Pizza in Pennsylvania was bread dough plus sausage , pepperoni , salami , ham and sometimes eggs . Sweets like biscotti and taralli used to be reserved for Christmas and Easter ; now they were eaten all year round . When Wolf had dieticians analyze the typical Rosetan 's eating habits , he found that a whopping 41 percent of their calories came from fat . Nor was this a town where people got up at dawn to do yoga and run a brisk six miles . The Pennsylvanian Rosetans smoked heavily , and many were struggling with obesity. // If it was n't diet and exercise , then , what about genetics ? The Rosetans were a close knit group , from the same region of Italy , and Wolf next thought was whether they were of a particularly hardy stock that protected them from disease . So he tracked down relatives of the Rosetans who were living in other parts of the United States , to see if they shared the same remarkable good health as their cousins in Pennsylvania . They didn't. // He then looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that there was something about living in the foothills of Eastern Pennsylvania that was good for your health ? The two closest towns to Roseto were Bangor , which was just down the hill , and Nazareth , a few miles away . These were both about the same size as Roseto , and populated with the same kind of hard-working European immigrants . Wolf combed through both towns ' medical records . For men over 65 , the death rates from heart disease in Nazareth and Bangor were something like three times that of Roseto . Another dead end . // What Wolf slowly realized was that the secret of Roseto was n't diet or exercise or genes or the region where Roseto was situated . It had to be the Roseto itself . As Bruhn and Wolf walked around the town , they began to realize why . They looked at how the Rosetans visited each other , stopping to chat with each other in Italian on the street , or cooking for each other in their backyards . They learned about the extended family clans that underlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes had three generations living under one roof , and how much respect grandparents commanded . They went to Mass at Our Lady of Mt . Carmel Church and saw the unifying and calming effect of the church . They counted twenty-two separate civic organizations in a town of just under 2000 people . They picked up on the particular egalitarian ethos of the town , that discouraged the wealthy from flaunting their success and helped the unsuccessful obscure their failures . // In transplanting the paesani culture of southern Italy to the hills of eastern Pennsylvania the Rosetans had created a powerful , protective social structure capable of insulating them from the pressures of the modern world . The Rosetans were healthy because of where they were from , because of the world they had created for themselves in their tiny little town in the hills . // " I remember going to Roseto for the first time , and you 'd see three generational family meals , all the bakeries , the people walking up and down the street , sitting on their porches talking to each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the men worked in the slate quarries , " Bruhn said . " It was magical . " // When Bruhn and Wolf first presented their findings to the medical community , you can imagine the kind of skepticism they faced . They went to conferences , where their peers were presenting long rows of data , arrayed in complex charts , and referring to this kind of gene or that kind of physiological process , and they talked instead about the mysterious and magical benefits of people stopping to talk to each other on the street and having three generations living under one roof . Living a long life , the conventional wisdom said at the time , depended to a great extent on who we were-that is , our genes . It depended on the decisions people made-on what they chose to eat , and how much they chose to exercise , and how effectively they were treated by the medical system . No one was used to thinking about health in terms of a place . // Wolf and Bruhn had to convince the medical establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new way : they had to get them to realize that you could n't understand why someone was healthy if all you did was think about their individual choices or actions in isolation . You had to look beyond the individual . You had to understand what culture they were a part of , and who their friends and families were , and what town in Italy their family came from . You had to appreciate the idea that community-the values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with-has a profound effect on who we are . The value of an outlier was that it forced you to look a little harder and dig little deeper than you normally would to make sense of the world . And if you did , you could learn something from the outlier than could use to help everyone else . // In Outliers , I want to do for our understanding of success what Stewart Wolf did for our understanding of health . // ( Continues ... ) //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
