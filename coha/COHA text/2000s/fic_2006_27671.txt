A Simple Plan By Scott Smith Random House Scott Smith 1 My parents died in an automobile accident the year after I was married . They tried to enter I-75 through an exit ramp one Saturday night and crashed head-on into a semi hauling cattle . My father was killed instantly in the wreck , decapitated by the hood of his car , but my mother , miraculously , survived . She lived for a day and a half more , hooked up to machines in the Delphia Municipal Hospital , her neck and back broken , her heart leaking blood into her chest . The semi driver came through it all with only a few minor bruises . His truck had caught fire , though , barbecuing the cattle , and after my mother died he sued my parents ' estate for damages . He won the suit but got no material satisfaction from it : my father had mortgaged his farm to the hilt and was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy when he died . My wife Sarah 's pet theory was that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his debts . I argued with her at the time , though not very wholeheartedly . In hindsight , you see , it seems that he may 've made certain preparations . A week before the accident , he came by my house in his pickup , its truck bed packed with furniture . Sarah and I had no use for any of it , but he was insistent , threatening to head straight for the dump if we did n't accept the entire load , so I helped him carry it , piece by piece , down to the basement . After he left us , he drove over to mybrother Jacob 's apartment and gave him the pickup . There was also his will , the first clause of which was an injunction upon Jacob and me that we swear orally , in each other 's presence , to visit his grave every year , without fail , on his birthday . It continued from there , a bizarrely elaborate document , pages and pages , going through the old farmhouse room by room , bequeathing each object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsequential -- a shaving kit , a broom , and an old Bible for Jacob ; a broken blender , a pair of work boots , and a black stone paperweight in the shape of a crow for me . It was pointless , of course , wasted effort . We had to sell everything of any value to pay the debts he 'd left behind , and the things of no value we had no use for . We had to sell the farm , too , our boyhood home . A neighbor bought it , grafting it to his own land , absorbing it like a giant amoeba . He knocked down the house , filled in the basement , and planted a soybean field on the lot . My brother and I had never been close , not even as children , and the gap between us only grew wider as we got older . By the time of the accident , we had very little except our parents left in common , and their sudden deaths eased whatever weight this might 've normally held . Jacob , older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and lived alone in a small apartment above the hardware store in Ashenville , the town in which we were raised , a tiny crossroads marked with a flashing yellow light , as rural as rural gets in northern Ohio . He worked on a construction crew in the summer and survived off unemployment benefits through the winter . I 'd gone to college , the first in my family to do so , graduating from the University of Toledo with a bachelor 's degree in business administration . I 'd married Sarah , a classmate of mine , and moved to Delphia , thirty miles east of Ashenville , just outside of Toledo . There we bought a three-bedroom , unabashedly suburban house -- dark green aluminum siding and black shutters , a two-car garage , cable TV , a microwave , the Toledo Blade delivered with a soft thump to our doorstep every evening at dusk . I commuted back to Ashenville each weekday , to the feedstore there , where I worked as assistant manager and head accountant . There was no animosity between Jacob and me , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , had difficulty finding things to say , and made little attempt to hide it . More than once , coming out onto the street after work , I saw him dodge into a doorway to avoid meeting me , and each time I felt more relief than pain . The one tie we did have , after our parents ' accident , was the keeping of our promise to our father . Year after year on his birthday we 'd repair to the cemetery and stand in stiff , awkward silence beside the grave site , each waiting for the other to suggest that a proper amount of time had passed , so that we could part and slip back into our separate lives . It was a depressing way to spend an afternoon , and we probably would 've given it up after the very first time had we both not felt that we 'd be punished somehow if we did , cursed from beyond the grave for our failure to stand by our word . Our father 's birthday was December 31 , the last day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritualized aspect , like any other event during the holiday season , a final hurdle to cross before reaching the new year . It became , essentially , our chief time to interact . We 'd catch up on each other 's lives , talk about our parents or our childhood , make vague promises to see each other more often , and leave the cemetery with the clean feeling of having rather painlessly fulfilled an unpleasant duty . This went on for seven years . On the eighth year , December 31 , 1987 , Jacob picked me up at my house . He came around three-thirty , a half hour late , with his dog and his friend Lou in his truck . They 'd been ice fishing together , their chief activity in the winter , and we had to drop Lou off on the other side of Ashenville before proceeding to the cemetery . I never liked Lou , and I do n't think he ever liked me . He used to call me Mr. Accountant , saying it in a way which seemed to imply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its conventionality and stability . I was peculiarly intimidated by him , though I could never discern exactly why . It certainly was n't his physical presence . He was a short , balding man , forty-five years old , just beginning to put on weight in the gut . His blond hair was thin , wispy , so that you could see his scalp beneath it , pink and chapped looking . He had crooked teeth , and they gave him a slightly comical quality , a mock toughness , making him look like some two-dimensional disreputable character out of a boy 's adventure book -- an old boxer , a street thug , an ex-con . As I came down the walk , he climbed out of the pickup to greet me , so that I 'd have to sit in the middle of the seat . " Howdy , Hank , " he said , grinning . Jacob smiled at me from behind the wheel . His dog , a big , overgrown mutt , mostly German shepherd , but with some Labrador thrown in on top , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Jacob had named him Mary Beth , after a girl he 'd dated in high school , his first and only girlfriend . He referred to him as a " she , " too , as if the dog 's name had blinded him to his gender . I climbed in , Lou pulled himself up behind me , and we backed our way down my driveway to the street . My house was in a small subdivision called Fort Ottowa , after a frontier outpost whose inhabitants had frozen to death in a blizzard sometime before the start of the Revolution . It was farmland , unrelentingly flat but made over to look like it was n't . The roads curved around imaginary obstacles , and people constructed little hills in their front yards , like burial mounds , covering them with shrubbery . The houses up and down the street were tiny , each one built right up against the next -- starter houses , the realtor had called them -- full of newly married couples on their way up in the world , or retirees on their way down , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter wait- ing for their savings to disappear , their health to suddenly worsen , their children to send them away to old-age homes . It was a way station , a rung near the bottom of the ladder . Sarah and I , of course , belonged to the first group . We had a nest egg , an account gathering interest in the Ashenville Savings Bank . Someday soon we were going to move away , take a step up in the world , the first of many . That was the plan , at least . Once beyond my neighborhood , we headed west , away from Delphia , and as we did the curving streets , the clustered groupings of two-story houses with circular driveways and swing sets and picnic tables rapidly dissolved away behind us . The roads straightened themselves , becoming narrower in the process . Snow blew across them in places , moving snakelike , in long , thin , dusty lines , piling up along their edges . Houses strayed from one another , separated by whole fields now rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened , and the view took on a windswept look , a white-gray barrenness . We passed fewer and fewer cars . It was an uncomfortable ride . Jacob 's truck was eleven years old , and there was nothing about it that did not show its age . At one time it had been painted a bright tomato red , my brother 's favorite color , but it was faded now to a scab- like burgundy , its sides pockmarked with rust . Its shocks were shot , its heater erratic . The rear window was missing , replaced by a sheet of plastic . The radio was broken , the windshield wipers torn off , and there was a hole the size of a baseball in the floor . A steady stream of cold air blew in through this , shooting straight up my right pant leg . Jacob and Lou talked about the weather as we drove , how cold it had been lately , when it would snow next , whether or not it had rained on the previous New Year 's Eve . I kept silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jacob , when I was with him and Lou together I felt both awkward and excluded . They had an aggressively private way of interacting ; their language was coded , intimate , their humor schoolboyish and obscure . Lou would say " pineapple , " with an extra stress on the " pine , " or Jacob would moo like a cow , and they 'd both immediately tumble into laughter . It was bewildering -- I could never escape the feeling that they were constantly making fun of me . We passed a frozen pond , with skaters on it , children in bright jackets shooting back and forth . Dark , weathered barns dotted the horizon . It never ceased to surprise me : we were ten minutes away from my house and already surrounded by farms . We drove south of Ashenville , skirting the town , keeping it just out of sight beyond the horizon , taking State High- way 17 , ruler straight , until we hit Burnt Road . We turned right there , heading north , then left onto Anders Park Road . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plowed snow piled thickly over its railings , making it look fake , like something from a Christmas story , a cookie-dough bridge . Beyond the creek was Anders Nature Preserve , a thickly wooded square of land that hovered at the right-hand edge of the road for the next two miles . It was a park , run by the county . There was a small pond at its very center , stocked with fish and surrounded by a mown field . People came out from Toledo during the summer to picnic there and play games , to throw Frisbees and fly kites . The place had originally been the private estate of Bernard C. Anders , an early automobile magnate from Detroit . He 'd bought the land in the 1920s and built a large summer house on it , the stone foundations of which were still visible beside the pond . When he died , during the Depression , the estate passed to his wife . She moved into the house year-round and lived there for the next four decades , finally leaving it only to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she chose to bequeath the land to the county , on the condition that they make it into a nature preserve and name it after her husband . It was an unusual place for a park , out in the middle of nowhere , surrounded on four sides by working farms , but the county , with an eye on state tax credits for parkland , accepted . The house was razed , picnic tables carted in , hiking trails cut , and Anders Nature Preserve was created . We 'd gone about a mile past the bridge , halfway down the southern edge of the park , when a fox sprinted in front of us . It all happened very quickly . I saw a flash of movement off to the left , coming out of the snow-covered field , had just enough time to focus in on it , see that it was a fox , a large , reddish one , sleek and healthy , a dead chicken hanging from its jaws , and it was in front of us , shooting across the road , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it might sneak by unseen . Jacob slammed on the brakes , too hard , and the truck went into a skid , its rear end coming out to the left , its front bumper sliding right , digging with a loud , raking sound into the snow at the edge of the road . There was the crystalline popping sound of a headlight shattering ; then the truck slammed to a stop . We were thrown forward , and the dog came flying in through the plastic rear window , tearing it , his legs scrambling in panic . He was there in the cab for just a moment -- I felt his fur , cold against the back of my neck -- then he was gone , back out the hole he had made , over the side of the truck , and into the woods after the fox . Jacob was the first to speak . " Fuck , " he said softly . " Fuck , fuck , fuck . " Lou giggled a little at that and pushed open his door . We climbed out onto the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at it for a bit , forming a semicircle around the front of the truck . Jacob tried calling the dog . " Mary Beth ! " he yelled . He whistled shrilly . No one seeing us standing there would 've ever recognized us as brothers . Jacob took after our father , while I took after our mother , and the difference was dramatic . I 'm brown haired , brown eyed , of medium height and build . Jacob was several inches taller than me , blue eyed , with sandy blond hair . He was also a fat , fat man , immensely , even grotesquely overweight , like a caricature of obesity . He had big hands , big feet , big teeth , thick glasses , and pale , doughy skin . We could hear the dog barking . He was getting farther and farther away . " Mary Beth ! " Jacob yelled . The trees were fairly thick here , standing close together -- maples , oaks , buckeyes , sycamores -- but there was relatively little undergrowth . I could see the fox 's tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the distance . Mary Beth 's paw prints ran parallel to them , a little darker in the snow , wider and rounder , like a trail of hockey pucks beneath the trees . The ground was perfectly flat . We listened to the dog 's barking grow fainter and fainter . On the other side of the road was a field , smooth with snow . I could see tracks there , too , coming toward us from the far horizon , perfectly straight , as if the fox had been walking along one of the field 's furrows , masked from view by the snow .
