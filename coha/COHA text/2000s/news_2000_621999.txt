<p> If you think you 've got stress , try working as a securities analyst  --  especially one specializing in Internet stocks , the most volatile and confounding securities of all . <p> With the stock market crashing or booming , depending on which half hour you watch it , and with market-rattling events unfolding at cyberspeed , people who might be able to make sense of it all are in frantic demand . <p> There is no escaping the demand  --  and the pressure . <p> David Readerman , 43 , director of Internet strategy and a partner with the Thomas Weisel investment-banking firm in San Francisco , says his brain is constantly being picked by his colleagues and the firm 's clients . <p> Not long ago , he was at the hospital getting treatment for his infant son when a colleague paged him to let him know that Microsoft Corp . was about to hold a press conference . <p> Readerman ( pronounced RED-der-man ) managed to tune in , learned that the company 's antitrust negotiations with the federal government had collapsed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the Internet sector . <p> Bottom line : He is still " bullish " on the Internet . <p> Another time , Readerman was awakened at 1 a.m. by a Weisel institutional salesman starting his workday in London who needed a thorough analysis of the proposed America Online acquisition of Time Warner Corp . so he could make a case for AOL as a buy or a sell . <p> " The price you pay to compete at the Olympic level is that you always have to be connected , " says the slender , fast-talking Readerman , who received his master degrees in business administration from New York University and has spent 17 years as an analyst , starting with Smith Barney in New York . " I feel as though I am in the middle of Alvin Toffler 's Future Shock . ' The rate of change keeps accelerating . " <p> Readerman has consistently been rated a star analyst by Institutional Investor magazine , the industry bible . <p> His boss , company founder , namesake and chief executive Thomas Weisel , says that Readerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet " and that he attracts a lot of business to the firm . <p> Readerman is so respected , in fact , that companies vie for his attention and sometimes get huffy if the day-to-day coverage of their stock is passed along to another of the firm 's Internet analysts . Companies with favorable prospects prefer to have the most acute analysts covering them , feeling that this helps them build their reputation with investors , lenders , suppliers and customers . <p> " One of our challenges is to persuade companies that we have other fine analysts here , " Weisel says . <p> The very best securities analysts earn upward of $1 million annually , but Readerman refuses to even hint at the size of his compensation . He does point out , however , that as a partner in the rapidly expanding Weisel firm , he shares in the profits . <p> Even when he is n't scrambling to interpret breaking news events , Readerman 's mission is formidable . <p> Internet stocks are notoriously difficult to evaluate because , for the most part , Internet companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Akamai Technologies , with market capitalizations well into the billions of dollars , are steeped in red ink . <p> For these companies , the traditional valuation measure  --  the ratio of stock price to earnings per share  --  is meaningless , at least for now . <p> " Profits matter , " Readerman says . " They determine the long-term value of a company . " <p> But he is willing to recommend purchases of companies that are n't reporting current earnings , provided his analysis indicates strong earnings potential . <p> In analyzing Internet companies , he looks at many types of Internet-related markets , and tries to " size them "  --  that is , estimate their ultimate potential . <p> He does this partly by analyzing from " the bottom up "  --  figuring out who the customers will be and how much spending capacity they have . <p> He also looks at markets from " the top down , " studying established , bricks-and-mortar companies that serve the same markets and estimating how much of that business could shift to the Internet . <p> Based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rational value for any of the dozens of Internet stocks Weisel covers . If the market price is lower than the estimate , he will recommend that investors buy the stock . <p> If the price is higher than his estimate of the value , he still must be prepared to explain why the market is pegging it so high . " I have to be able to articulate the assumptions that are priced into that stock . " <p> Appropriately enough , Readerman 's comments and recommendations can be read on the Internet at the Weisel Web site , www.tweisel.com . The firm also publishes his newsletter called D.I.R.T .  --  an acronym for Dreaderman 's Internet Research Trends . <p> Readerman finds it daunting that an analyst 's performance is so easy to quantify . If you are wrong , he notes , you ca n't bluff your way out ; your mistakes are plainly measurable in dollars and cents . <p> " From the time the market opens at 6:30 a.m. until it closes at 1 p.m. , " he says , " you can tell exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you money or losing it for you . " <p> But he points out that as an analyst of Internet stocks , he has a better chance of finding an unexpected bonanza for his clients than analysts who focus on stable , blue-chip companies . <p> Analysts who follow such high-visibility giants as General Electric , for example , seldom differ much  --  if at all  --  in their estimates of the next quarter 's financial results . <p> By contrast , estimates from Internet analysts range all over the lot because the companies they follow are constantly changing . <p> " These are companies hell-bent on disruptive change , " Readerman says . " If we can discover the next big thing they are planning before others do , the returns to our clients can be huge . As an analyst , you are trying to forecast events . When all the news comes out , it will be priced into the stock . " <p> Readerman says his work on any given day actually starts " the night before , around 9 or 10 p.m. , " when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the next day 's Wall Street Journal online . <p> " I can never allow myself to wake up and be surprised , " he explains . <p> He usually goes to bed too late to get more than five hours of sleep . " I am a very caffeinated individual . " <p> Readerman arrives at the Weisel offices on Kearny Street by 5 a.m. , where he conducts premarket meetings with five other analysts he supervises . <p> He usually finds his voice mail clogged with calls from " London and New York institutional accounts , company managements , the press . " He also , typically , has to sort through 80 to 100 e-mails . <p> He keeps a watchful eye on the market action throughout the trading day , and after the 1 p.m. closing bell he often heads down to Silicon Valley to schmooze with high-tech managers and venture capitalists . <p> Having what Readerman calls " the epicenter of the Internet " nearby is one of the great advantages of working as an analyst in the Bay Area . He says he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Coast analysts . <p> " I spend as much time in the Valley as possible . Otherwise , I might as well be working in New York . " A few weeks ago , for example , he visited Yahoo in Santa Clara to discuss the plans for the recently launched Yahoo FinanceVision , a live financial information service operating on the Net at financevision.yahoo.com . <p> " I wanted to meet the people , see the service , kick the tires , " Readerman says . " I got the clear sense that Yahoo wants to become a full-fledged media network . This gave me a jump to communicate that to our institutional sales force . " <p> He flies well over 100,000 miles per year , mostly to meet with institutions that do business with his firm . It is n't unusual for him to fly to the East Coast for a meeting and return to San Francisco the same day . <p> On Friday nights , he collapses into bed by 7 p.m . " I need the weekends to recharge , " he says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend hobbies include hiking , mountain biking and downhill and cross-country skiing . <p> Many market watchers are skeptical about the value of research reports turned out by sell-side analysts . Because these analysts work for investment bankers or brokers that are in business to sell stocks , the reasoning goes , they have a vested interest in promoting the stocks of companies that deal with their firms . <p> Readerman acknowledges that there is potential for conflicts of interest , but he says he makes a point of giving companies the ratings he thinks they deserve . <p> " An analyst is only as good as his public reputation for integrity , " he observes . " I take my profession very seriously . " <p> However , like most analysts , he and his colleagues generally refrain from issuing outright " sell " recommendations . Wall Street firms do n't want to permanently antagonize present or potential clients by overusing that four-letter word . <p> Instead , they fall back on the euphemism " hold , " whose meaning is clear enough to most people who follow the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " as Readerman dryly observes . <p> E-mail Arthur M.
