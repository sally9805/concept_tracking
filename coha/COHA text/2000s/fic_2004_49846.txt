HOWARD TOOK A LOOK AT 2 FORRESTER ROAD , and knew it was kids . Some places were jobs . Others were leisure sports-ten-speeds hanging from the garage ceiling . Where he 'd been this morning , 5380 Cordelia , had been books , which was a real stretch for him . He skimmed two newspapers , plus Time , Newsweek , Ms. , Women 's World , Collector , and Popular Mechanics to fill his mind with the loose change of knowledge he needed every day . For news , he watched CNN ; for culture , PBS . But he had n't finished a book in he did n't know how long . He tried the psychic approach . " Who 's the reader in the family ? Let me guess , let me guess . I bet it 's you . " It was n't . So , with 5380 Cordelia , he 'd been reduced to admiring an antique dresser , which any half-witted sales rep could do . If he got the go-ahead on that one , he would n't deserve it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road . There , impudently astride the walk , was one of those damned red-and-yellow , squat little plastic tricycles . Kid City . The woman had contacted the agency just that morning , and he was there to convince her that he could sell her house to a nice family just like her own . He was reaching across the car seat for the paperwork , when his cell phone tootled a tune at his belt , hanging there like a noisy bug . He tugged it off , flipped it open , and shifted into phone voice : " Howard Biel here . " It was his standard greeting , and it always gave him an Eggzisstential feeling to know that , wherever he might be in his itinerant day , he was always " here . " <p> " Where 's ' here ' ? " asked the tiny , strident voice . Clara . His heart jumped slightly , but nothing had changed . All she wanted was the last word . <p> " What is it , Clara ? I 'm with a client . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " How could you go to work today ? " <p> " I 've got appointments . " <p> " You could n't cancel them ? Like other people with a crisis ? " <p> " Be right with you , " he faked an aside , then made his voice crisp . " Got ta go . Talk t ' ya later . " <p> He pressed his thumbnail into the button that turned off the phone . He did n't have time for this now . he was about to meet the lady of 2 Forrester Road for the first time , and nothing annoyed people like being interrupted by your phone . They felt upstaged . After your footing was established , well , then it was different . You could sigh , raise your eyes to heaven , let them know how much you hated to break the mood . Was that what killed it for Clara-all those phone calls breaking the mood ? <p> Avoiding the tricycle , he walked up to the front stoop . He 'd barely noted the paint shavings curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing her face without greeting him . In his mental Rolodex , she was instantly filed as Mrs. Mole-Lip . She was a short woman , with a nose like pinched clay , worried eyes , and thin blonde hair swept back by a hurricane . Just above her lip perched a mole like a ladybug . She was going to need a realtor she could lean on . <p> " Mrs. Corey ? I 'm **27;2158;TOOLONG ' - Associates ? " <p> " Oh , come in , come in . Just step over that . You 'll have to forgive the place . It really looked fine just an hour ago . " He followed her , sparing the life of a Barbie doll . <p> " You do n't have to tell me , " he smiled knowingly . " Kids of my own . " It did n't even seem like a lie anymore , just adaptive coloring . <p> After the opening amenities , she took him on a tour of the scuffed and dreary ranch-style home . He won her confidence with little bits of amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towels the same way , with the closed side facing out . <p> " Makes a great impression , " he said . <p> Then she brought him back into the cramped living room . He parked himself at an angle on the edge of the corduroy sofa , trying to look casual but not too relaxed . His pressed-together knees said I 'm working for you already . He refrained from mentioning the cracks in the molding-time enough for that later . Phase One called for comments like , " Nice open floor plan " ; " Western exposure , great afternoon light , is n't there ? I thought so " ; " Do n't worry about it , we can always replace the carpet . " <p> Mrs. Mole-Lip had placed a cup of lukewarm brown stuff next to the folder he had opened on the coffee table . Then she had thrown herself back into the armchair facing him , glad , he imagined , for the chance to sit down . It was time for Phase Two . <p> " Of course , you 'll want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the one who 's going to be in the trenches on this moving business . Am I right ? " <p> The woman across from him smiled , though not with the usual " You said it ! " flash . Trouble in the marriage ? He 'd noticed that the rockier the relationship , the weaker the sense of humor . He pulled out his felt-tip pen and used it as a wand to separate the folders on the table . " But I want you both to be comfortable . Here 's our Commitment to You . " He pulled out a sheet of parchment-style paper with a list of realtor responsibilities and services , printed in a startling blue color . <p> " What 's it worth ? " <p> He turned to her , paper in midair . " Thi-s ? " <p> " The house . " <p> " Oh , " he let out his breath and smiled . " We 'll get to that . As you know , many factors are involved . Similar homes in the neighborhood . General condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you can give us an estimate , right ? That 's why I called . " <p> Howard put down his list , settled into the depths of the sofa , and folded his arms . He got the picture . Mrs. Corey had called four or five agencies . She wanted to see which one would set the highest asking price , never mind how reasonable it was or what message it sent . This was a woman with diapers to change , clothes to buy , college to plan for . She wanted no Commitments to Her . She wanted a price tag . <p> Even after all his years in the business , it was hard sometimes not to resent these people with their oh-so-predictable and transparent motives , their conviction that nothing in the world was more important than their own little universe , and their ridiculously inflated notions of what their precious homes were worth . <p> " Mrs. Corey , " he said patiently . " I understand that you 'd like to have a definite answer , but really I should do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Ninety thousand . " <p> Mrs. Corey clapped her hand to her mouth . " You 've got to be kidding . We bought it for a hundred . " When her hand came away , the mole had disappeared . Howard stared and moved forward in his seat , feeling a prickle in his armpits and a shake in his hand , as he shuffled his folder closed . Mrs. Corey was brushing something off her lap . <p> " Perhaps , as an estimate , that 's a little low . When did you buy the house , if I may ask ? " <p> " Five years ago . " <p> " And how old were your children then ? " <p> " Sarah was n't born yet , Billy was one ' n ' a half , and Rob was three . " <p> " So now you 've got three kids , the oldest an eight-year-old . That means wear ' n ' tear , Mrs. Corey . It 's not your fault . It 's the way things are . Plus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . " That , too , was protective coloring , but she would n't know the difference . <p> She seemed to sink a little lower in the chair , and her eyes were fixed moodily on the table , littered with the facts of life . " Well , " she said . " Of course , I understand that . But we 're going to fix things up . " <p> He wanted to say , Great , give me a call when you 're through , but as always , he checked himself . Kids . That was the button . He pushed it . " There are certain things that will make all the difference-small things , not even that expensive . Scrape the paint a little here and there . The house has great potential . Somebody with kids is going to love the view of the backyard from the kitchen . " <p> But a decision was hardening in her eyes . She stood up . " Well , I really do appreciate your stopping by . We 'll think it over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She bent over the coffee table and flicked what looked like a small raisin . <p> Knowing it was hopeless , he said , " Give me a call anytime . Let me give you my cell phone number . " <p> She had pushed open the front door . " I have the agency number , " she said , and then her face grew oddly tight and lumpy , and she spoke as if short of breath . " I know the house is a mess . I 've got toys all over , and crumbs on my face . . . . " Her eyes glistened with tears . " But I do n't appreciate being told how to fold my towels ! " <p> He stood facing the closed door for a few seconds , and then turned , wavering on the step . Even after he made it back to the car , he was still too dazed to reach for the ignition . How could he have missed it ! The woman was sensitive about her housekeeping , and he should have adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little nub of shame and regret formed in his chest . Damn Clara for throwing him off his game today . <p> Mechanically , Howard drove toward the newer suburbs . He was on a newly improved road , and gradually the smooth , graphite-colored ribbon with its crisp white dashes tugged him like a leash . He was passing the landscaped entrances to housing developments with names like " Canterbury Falls , " and " Thornville Manor . " Off duty , he often joked that you could make up the most far-fetched , British-sounding name , and you 'd find it on some gate in the Atlanta suburbs . But there was something almost wistful in the pretentiousness , and he was secretly touched by it . He liked these neighborhoods , with their pushy contentment . Of course , he could n't afford to live here himself-as Clara was always reminding him . His female associates could , but that was because they were married to doctors and lawyers . <p> Clara . Some women were clothes , cars , houses-things . Others were feelings . I'm-so-happy-I'm-so-sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying out ideas of who they were , what was missing from their livesi.e. , what you owed them . He kept up on the lingo by scanning the magazines in the privacy of his car . By now , his mind worked like an instant decoder . Clara could ask about his day , and he knew she was " gauging her options . " Just this morning , she 'd said the bathroom was too small . " Testing her wingspread . " <p> He thought where they lived was just fine . Two-story shingle , with a porch-excuse me , a veranda-and trees more than a century old . When he 'd first taken his mother to see the house , she 'd peered at the sign for " Turnbull Circle , " then settled serenely back in her seat : " If I 'm not mistaken , the Griersons lived on this street . " Whoever the hell they were , it was a dead certainty that they had lived in the neighborhood . His mother was a walking atlas of Atlanta 's old families . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College-he 'd seen the place : Old Kentucky Home without the slaves-and the two of them had decided that Tim would take over his father 's real estate business and bring in Howard as an associate . Saving two sons from the ' 70s with one coup . If women had run the Confederacy , the South would have triumphed . " Take a look at those bushes . You wo n't see those in the new subdivisions , " he 'd said to his mother , pointing out the mature shrubbery around his house . <p> But Clara did n't care about six-foot azaleas . She wanted a brick house with a Palladian window in the front . She wanted a subdivision with a gate and an honest-to-God attendant . " OK , Marry , " she 'd said that morning , as if spreading a royal flush on the table . " She is n't married to anybody special . What 's her husband do ? I 've never seem him wear a tie . " Comparing husbands was Phase One . Phase Two was always , " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come we do n't live in Buckhead ? " <p> If he 'd spoken to her in that tone , if he 'd said , " Who 's paying for this roof ? " he 'd have sent shock waves through her buddies , all those women who shopped at the supermarket in tennis clothes . Clara wore those little white skirts , too , even though she did n't know one end of a racket from the other . He imagined the knowing glances , the impromptu strategy sessions , whenever two or more of those outfits passed each other in the cereal aisle . <p> And so , deliberately , knowing full well what he was doing , he had said , offhandedly , " If you want a double income , go get a job . " What a day she 'd have of it ! " Guess what he said to me ! " " You 're kidding ! " She 'd be armed when he got home : " So that 's your tactic . " Or , " Trying to make me your scapegoat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorically reject your definition of me . " That was his favorite . As he recalled , he 'd left this morning before losing his cool . Oh , he " got it . " He understood what her problem was . It was lack of imagination . <p> Righting the drifting wheel , he refocused his eyes on the road . Forget Clara . Think yuppie . Remember the fan joke . Five minutes later , he turned into Berkshire Manor , heading for 22 Crestview Lane . His clients , the owners of the house , were carefully out of the way , and he was meeting the prospective buyers at the property . Their agent , Marcy-would n't you know it-had given him one name only : Arthur Kemp . <p> She 'd let slip that there were children , though . Children , ergo wife . Her name would be key . " Forgetting " that little detail was Marcy 's payback for last month , when he 'd guessed right about the urn at 4 Morningside . Marcy , he 'd learned later , had called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawn shades , the absence of desk or TV , the spotlighted urn , and had asked , timidly , if the room might possibly be a-a shrine ? Mrs. Blue-Hair had burst out crying , and the listing was his . So forget about Mrs. Mole-on-Mole-off . You win some , you lose some . That was the attitude he should be taking with Clara . <p> As he pulled into the cul-de-sac on Crestview , he saw a green Taurus station wagon already parked there , with people inside . As a gesture of solidarity , he , too , parked in the street . After checking his expression in the rearview mirror , he got out of his own car , squaring his shoulders and clearing his throat . Smile clamped , folder at the ready , he entered the arena . He 'd taken only about four steps before a red BMW swept across his path and rolled authoritatively into the driveway of 22 Crestview . Damn ! He should have done that . <p> The door of the red car swung open , and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit of armor . With a mere wave at Howard , she strode over to her clients ' car and gave them the signal . Your protector is here . So Howard faced the three of them as he crossed the cul-de-sac . <p> Arthur Kemp was a small , fit-looking man in khaki shorts and complicated leather sandals . He had on a polo shirt with a flaring , upright collar , and his lightly freckled , amiable face said , " I was born on a career track . " Lawyer ? Yes , that 's what Marcy had said-though she might 've been trying for leverage . From the man 's car , shirt , and footgear , the wife was deducible . She was tanned and pretty , with a blonde halo of expensively streaked hair . The legs in those jaunty white shorts . . . get a grip , Howard . Eyes on the target . <p> Extending his hand , he said to Arthur , " Nice t ' meet you . **26;2187;TOOLONG ' - Associates . " As he held the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excellent taste in realtors . " <p> " Hiya , Howard , " said Marcy . Her tightly coiffed hair , sign-painted mouth , and bulky jewelry always ganged up on him . He turned to Mrs. Kemp . " I 'm so sorry the Fortescues are out of town . Amy would have loved to meet you . " Nothing in his regretful voice betrayed the truth-that his clients were killing time at a McDonalds a few blocks away . Marcy 's eyes swiveled . " On vacation , are they ? " she asked , with mock concern . " They can be reached , if we have any questions ? " <p> " Oh , yes , " said Howard , tapping his pocket . " A phone call away . " And for a second , he almost enjoyed playing this friendly little game with his adversary in front of unsuspecting civilians . Then Marcy said , " Thank God for satellites . Is n't it amazing ? Timbuktu 's right around the corner . Howard , this is Arthur Kemp . And this is Sally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Kemps and Marcy . When they were almost at the door , he moved around them , " Excuse me , " and took the key , with a tag saying 22 CRESTVIEW from his pocket . He liked to keep his back turned to the clients as he huddled over the lock , then gave the door a push . " Open Sesame ! " <p> Inside , Howard turned to collect his audience . It was a two-story entrance hall with the standard brass-lantern chandelier , oak-rail stair case , and imitation ficus tree , all of which he summed up by circling his hand in the air : " Formal entry . " Sally fingered a glued-on leaf . She 'd want to look critical , but the way her head kept moving and her breathing quickened , he guessed she was thrilled by the word " foyer . " Sally might be feelings , she might be notions , but she was definitely things . In an offhand way , Marcy had dropped the hint that the Kemps were apartment dwellers hungry to move into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brick-faced traditional , was made to order for them . Its only flaw was an accident of location . The far end of the backyard , being the lowest point in the subdivision , contained a fenced-in area around a cement drain required by law . Camouflaged by trees and dry as a bone , it was nevertheless called a " detention pond , " hinting at stagnant water , eyesore potential , and maintenance problems . His strategy ? Keep people away from the windows in the rear . He had unforeseen help from Sally . <p> In the family room , she walked the perimeter , then bent at the waist to look behind the TV , presenting her haunch for inspection . <p> " No cable ? " she asked over her shoulder . <p> " Mmmmm , excuse me ? " <p> " I do n't see the cable thingy . This house does have cable , does n't it ? " He was looking into a pair of China-blue eyes that were almost accusatory . <p> " Why , of course . It 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people . . . " The set of her smooth , honey-colored jaw and Bo Derek lips told him to stop . She was facing a challenge . A ripple of effort passed behind her eyes , but she simply could n't do it . She could n't imagine people who lived in a neighborhood with cable and failed to hook it up . <p> " Well , so long as it 's wired , " she said . " Arthur ? " <p> Mr. Kemp had been nearing the back window in the kitchen . At his wife 's call , he turned and padded quickly over to her . " Yes , dear ? " <p> " There 's no deck . " <p> Howard sprang into action . " Amy and Dan are the kind of people who actually use their outdoor living space . That 's why they had this screened-in porch custom-made . Come have a look . . . . " Mrs. Kemp had visions of entertaining alfresco . He 'd have to risk it . The porch overlooked the detention pond , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West ambience . Raising his eyes upward and then crinkling them at Sally , he purred , " Take a look at the brand name . Ca-sa-blanc-a . " <p> She nodded . " I 've heard they 're the best . " <p> He was ready : " So you 're a Bogart fan , too ? " Then , with a confidential moue , " Sorry about that ! " Her expression did not change one iota . <p> His armpits were tingling again . Please , please , do n't let this be another 2 Forrester Road . He could n't afford two in one day . Beckoning Arthur to the side , he said , " Just between you and me " - he lowered his voice- " we have to face reality , and if I were buying into an attractive neighborhood like this , I would n't mind a little extra security . An open deck leaves you-how sh 'll I put it-just a little more . . . open . " But Arthur was peering at a tiny hole in the screening , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking straight at ... The polo shirt turned and spoke : " What 's that cement thing down there in the bushes , and why is that fence there ? " <p> A great weariness settled over Howard . He understood how CassWhat was that Greek gal 's name ? He understood how she must have felt , knowing everything so clearly in advance . It was as if he saw Arthur through an inverted telescope that reduced him to a speck on the screen . What a funny little insect he was , flexing his attorney wings . He 'd get cunning now , asking about liability , hoping to bring the price down . It was obvious his wife needed the house in order to be the woman she wanted to be-so it was all a question of bluff and counterbluff . <p> Howard understood everything so completely that he felt it had all happened already . The moments stretching ahead promised to be as boring as the tenth rerun of an old sitcom . And at the end of it , there was Clara , waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought and sold houses for everybody but her . That they lived in a dump . And if that 's how little he thought of her , then she had to take charge of her own happiness . She owed it to herself to realize her potential , which required , at the very least , 2400 square feet of hardwood flooring . <p> It was pretty obvious what Arthur 's wife required . All Howard had to do was make it easy for this man , and everybody would be happy . At least until the ink dried on the contract . Then she 'd want a designer Jeep Cherokee . Eddie Bauer all the way . Arthur would take up cycling , so he could wear spandex and a beetle-shaped helmet and get out of the house . In four years , they 'd be eyeing the entrance to Windsor Estates . But would they give Howard a call ? Would they want his expert opinion on how to fold towels ? Hell , no . He saw the future , and he was n't in it . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Clara-for knowing them better than they knew themselves . <p> He shrugged and said flatly : " That 's the detention pond . It 's the mandatory sinkhole for the neighborhood . " <p> Arthur 's eyes widened . " Well , I do n't know . . . " <p> " About what ? " <p> " Suppose it gets backed up or something . That 's the City 's responsibility , is n't it ? " <p> " It 's your property . " <p> " I beg your pardon . . . ? " <p> " It 's up to you , " said Howard . " A house means repairs . Say a window leaks , or the dish-washer dies . Whatterya gon na do ? Call the maintenance guy ? You 're him . " He watched the freckled geniality pale , as Arthur looked around for Marcy . Look at me , thought Howard . He was a match for any man in woven-leather sandals . He could see it all . Any house Arthur bought would n't be kids . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . It would be location . Arthur and his wired-for-cable wife would always be looking for the right place to be , the spot they belonged because-hey , they deserved it . They were n't the sort of people to live near a hole in the ground where nature might piss . <p> Suddenly Marcy was between them . Howard could see the furring of her lipstick at the edges , the clotting of mascara on her lashes . " Arthur , " she said , in a voice like a grip on the elbow : " I do think you should take a look out back . " <p> " I just did , " said her client , regaining some of his grown-up schoolboy seriousness , now that Mama Realtor was listening . " And , " he added , with a reproachful look at Howard , " I do have some questions . " <p> Fifteen minutes later , Marcy took her clients back to their car . Howard stayed behind , circling the house to make sure the lights were : off . He was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owners , who were munching their Big Macs with absolute faith in him . What could he say to them ? " Sorry . I blew the deal because-because . . . " ? There was nothing , absolutely nothing , wrong with Arthur and Sally . They were a sale just waiting to happen . Hell , they 'd bought the house before they walked in the door . A realtor 's dream , that 's what they were . Every marketer 's target audience . The ideal couple . And Howard had put a question in the man 's mind and a frown on the woman 's face . He 'd done it deliberately , and he did n't know why . He had just . . . wanted to . Usually , he took a few notes at this point , some impressions to follow up later , but he stuck the felt-tip pen in his pocket . <p> As he stepped outside , he saw that Marcy 's car was still in the driveway . She was leaning against its side with her arms folded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grimly , he touched a finger to his forehead and flipped it off in a mock salute . Marcy heaved herself upright and walked at an angle , intercepting him at the curb . <p> " You really impressed those two , " she said . <p> " I 'll bet . " <p> She was giving him the once-over , the way Clara did when she was trying to decide whether it was his shirt or his tie she did n't like . " Arthur-he 's cute , is n't he ? - said , ' Well , at least he 's honest . ' " <p> Howard kept walking , but she stayed with him . " I probably should n't tell you this , " she went on , " but those two are n't married yet . Not that it makes any difference . And they 're going to be . After they find the right house . " <p> With cable and a deck and an easy walk to the tennis court . That 's what Arthur was on the hook for . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shorts . Howard grimaced . Oh , it was n't Sally 's ass or Arthur 's money he was jealous of . It was their pure and complete knowledge of what their lives required in order to be-not perfect , not meaningful , not even necessarily happy-but enviable . They knew exactly what was expected of people like themselves , and they had no real questions . The sale was made years ago , and not by Howard . Had none of it really mattered , then-all the psyching out , all the knowledge of just exactly what people wanted , all the chameleon behavior as he arranged for the mating of buyer and house ? <p> He had turned a corner , and was driving on a street that was new to him . Fortunately , no cars were coming the other way as he crossed the line occasionally from inattention . Would it do any good to call Clara ? Tell her he had one more call to make ( a lie ) , and then he 'd be home , and did she want anything from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt no need to carry it out , because he knew exactly what she 'd say . " Do n't bother , unless you buy a new attitude . " For her , it was just that simple . If only he 'd adjust some knob in his head , she would n't have to pretend that she played in a tennis league , that her husband was an Arthur instead of a Howard . <p> For the first time that day , he stopped hearing her voice in his head and made himself picture her . He saw the short , straight , brownish-black hair , showing a bit of scalp on the top . Lipstick always caked in the corners , always slightly out of bounds . Her eyes seemed to float ahead of him until he could n't bear their sadness any longer . They were old eyes . They were n't even glancing at him , but at some void behind his shoulder . A bead of ice rolled down his spine . <p> In the streetlamps , the photoelectric cells were triggered by the weakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthening dusk . he cruised the parts of the map that were closely veined with streets , and then the blank sections on the edge of town . When he realized he was heading toward open country , he nosed the car into a gravel lane next to a row of black mailboxes leaning into each other like a drunken chorus line . Two or three had their lids hanging open like tongues . The tires slid and then bit , carrying him onto the unmarked road . <p> Laurrel and Associates did not handle rural lots , and he had no idea how much the land around him was worth . The ditch alongside the road was hairy with tall grass that turned into bushes and small trees on the upper lip of the gully . Occasionally there was a gap showing dark vacant space , flat except for a bulge that might be a cow . These were the crimped and fraying edges of urban sprawl . Up ahead , a mass of dark trees surrounded a mole of a shack , oddly brownish in color . Were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was n't , but as he came closer he saw that it was abandoned . Small homesteads were crumbling away as their owners gave up , moved to the suburbs , bought a Winnebago , died . His realtor instincts perked up for a moment and then quit . There was simply no way he could convince anybody to move out here . <p> He could n't get his bearings . What happened when you had to pass somebody on this cowpath ? Quiet as the landscape was , the turn up ahead looked ominous . He began to imagine a pickup truck , like a hurtling cloud of dust , bearing down on him . It would flip him over like a ladybug and leave him struggling in the ditch . Pressing down on the accelerator , he reached the driveway to the blackened house and poked into it . He turned off the engine , then turned it on again so he could lower his power window . As the cool air leaked out , the heat muscled in . He turned the key again for silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scruffy abandoned lot would be sharing the same breath . Across from him , carefully positioned against a tree , was a detached and weathered car seat , like a fist without an arm . <p> Thirteen hours ago , he 'd opened puffy eyes to the gentle wet flapping in Clara 's throat . If you told her she snored , she acted as if you 'd disparaged her cooking . " If you do n't like it ... , " she 'd say . " I do n't like it , " he 'd say . " Two can play at that game ! " " Take your best shot . " " You 're just being ... " " What ? " " Confrontational . " " Me ! " So he 'd come to accept , without comment , the faint underscoring of every breath that struggled to his wife 's lips . The sound drew a tiny file over his nerves every morning , until he threw back his covers with an " urrrhhggggg ! " and padded on sleep-tender feet into the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made him close his eyes and sigh . Shaving was no fun , though , because he had to notice the islanding of that tuft of hair high on his forehead , the folded swag of flesh under his eyes , and that bellied drape below his chin . Age was a crummy upholsterer . <p> At breakfast , he and Clara had a routine . He grabbed the milk and juice and brought them to the table . Dodging the closing refrigerator door , she reached for the cereal and sugar , bypassed him on the return for spoons , plunked down her goods , and went for the bowls . It was n't teamwork so much as a refined ability to stay out of each other 's way . There 'd been a time when they 'd rather enjoyed bumping into a shoulder or a hip , but that was long ago . There was n't much need for talking anymore , either . Not since cell phones made it so easy to check on the essentials . " I 'll be late-Crossetts ca n't meet me till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the porkchops look good . " They stayed in touch . <p> This morning , though , she 'd forgotten the sugar , so he 'd known something was on her mind . All day , he 'd been dismissing what followed , revising it in his mind until it was just the same old script , just the same old fight , nothing he could n't handle . He had a right to protect himself , because , for God 's sake , he had the Marcys of the world to contend with , not to mention the women with dried husbands in vases or fake moles on their lip ... . But the truth had grabbed him in Arthur 's presence . It had given him a buzz . Even now , he could feel a hot flash in the palm of his hand . Was that what had happened to Clara , too ? He tried , really tried this time , to remember . . . . <p> " Tim says you guys 've got a listing over in Shropshire Woods . " She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd you see Tim ? " <p> " Well , actually , I saw the ad in the Constitution , so I called him . " She stopped pouring the milk to add quickly , " It 's his listing . " <p> Her calling Tim involved so many layers of betrayal and bad judgment that he barked a laugh . " Yeah , so ? We 've got a listing in Shropsher Woods . It 's like the sauce . You know . Wuss-ter-sher . " <p> " It sounds just scrumptious . Wood paneling in the family room . And a wadda-ya-call-it , a solarium . " <p> " What do you think the mortgage is on a **28;2215;TOOLONG solarium , with house attached ? " <p> " All 's I said was , it sounded . . . nice . You meet new people when you move . " <p> It was n't what he needed , not with Marcy on the horizon today . He should be concentrating , thinking up his angles . He said , " This house is nice , too . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veranda . It 's got nice , mature landscaping . " <p> " Yeah , the bushes are old , but so 's everything else about this place . Nobody 's got a central hallway anymore . " <p> He did n't bother to look , because he knew what he 'd see : a forty-five-year-old woman on the verge of tears because she could walk in a straight line from her front door to her back door . " Honey , we ca n't afford to move right now . Maybe if I can keep Marcy from blabbing about the detention pond at this Crestview place . . . " <p> " Marcy . What 's her husband do ? " <p> " How should I know ? " <p> " You told me once . I 've never seen him wear a tie . How come Marcy 's so well off ? She lives in Buckhead , does n't she ? There 's so much to do in Buckhead . " <p> The unfairness of it ! Today , when everything depended on his being alert , focused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cereal bowl . <p> " What ? " she said . <p> " You want a double income ? Go get a job . Nobody 's stopping you . " <p> Predictably , the tears would spill , but he refused to look . <p> " I should 've years ago . " <p> " What ? " he said . <p> " I should have . But you did n't want me to . Now-look at me-what can I do now ? Sell Big Macs ? " He glanced at her , but only for a second , because it was too painful . Mornings , she let him have the run of the bathroom , so her face was a rumpled pillow , unwashed , unprotected by the gunk she would soon be applying . Unbelievably , she was waiting for an answer . <p> " I do n't have time for this , " he said abruptly , standing up with his bowl in his hand but forgetting what to do with it . <p> " Oh , so that 's your tactic . Ignore the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You get to do whatever you want all day . Any damn thing . Prance around the store in those shorts that make you look like God knows what . Jabber to your friends all day . Nobody on your neck . Nobody expecting anything . Calling up people 's bosses behind their back . " He was still seething over that . <p> " What friends ? " She sounded amazed . But then she stood up , too . Something in her eyes was different . " Is that how you see me ? Is that your definition of me ? A silly old woman who is n't accountable to anybody or anything ? Is that how worthless you think I am ? " <p> Embarrassment flooded him-for her . Where was she getting this kind of talk ? Whoever she was hanging out with , whatever she wanted to call them . . . He jumped as if a live wire had brushed him . Clara was touching him on the arm , tilting her head oddly , saying almost thoughtfully , " When did it happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then she was shuffling off on those mashed-down blue slippers of hers that went sllliipppp-slop , sllliipppp-slop , like the feet of some strange house beast shambling away . <p> Yes , that 's what had happened . What a look she 'd given him ! As if she 'd wanted to remember somebody who was n't even there anymore . Sitting in the hot car , in a place that was n't on any realtor 's map , he felt the smear of moisture on his forehead . Across from him , he could still see the empty car seat , ripped out of some junker that was no doubt rusting behind the shack up ahead . What could have possessed somebody to lug that thing up to the road ? To place it so carefully and hopefully on that little rise at the base of the tree , under the canopy of its branches ? What was so wonderful about the view from there ? <p> " When did . " " Lose . " " Kindness . " The words circled through his brain like goldfish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news to him , a revelation she gave and took away again in the same breath . He 'd lost it , she 'd said . When ? How ? And what did she mean by saying such a thing while he was eating his breakfast ? Implying that she was lonely ! Was she winding up some business of her own ? Would she be gone when he got home ? He realized that he had n't the faintest idea what was in his wife 's mind , and had n't for years . <p> On the way back , he drove by instinct , forgetting to close the window , feeling stabs of abandonment as he took the corners too fast . He wanted to be home already , but he did n't want to get there . He had to find out , but he did n't want to know . <p> It was black outside when he pulled into his own driveway and let his lights and ignition go cold . The front windows of the house were n't lighted , but she was frugal with electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Usually , he collected his notebook and folders , but this time he left them on the passenger seat . Crossing the lawn at an angle , he was n't looking where he was going until his leg struck something at ground level . " Shit ! " he cried softly , wondering at the stiffness , the lack of give , in whatever had grabbed him . It was a board on a stick , a sign obviously , but he could n't make out the words . He wiggled it . He pulled it . The stake had really been pounded in . A campaign poster ? He 'd have to get a flashlight-wait , he had one in the car . <p> While he was getting it , his throat went dry with premonition . And it was not entirely a surprise when the light revealed the generic sign she could have bought at any hardware store : FOR SALE BY OWNER . He had absolutely no idea whether it was a joke or a threat , but he sat down on the grass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen , wrote his cell phone number in the space provided . <p>
