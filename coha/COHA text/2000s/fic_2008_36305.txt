Though only an hour past dawn , late August , the air was hot and heavy with the aroma of wood smoke , frying fatback , and horses . Jonathan Lydell stepped through the front door onto his porch . He adjusted the brass buttons of his newly brushed and pressed gray uniform and took in the road below . Cato , the slave he rented by the day to Cartwright the innkeeper , had the coach horses in hand , leading them , snorting and stamping , from the barn at the rear of the inn across the road . The old man moved slowly , leading the wheel horses out first . The coachman held up his long coiled whip and saluted Lydell . <p> " Captain Lydell , your lodger up yet ? We 'll be pulling out soon 's the boy gets us hitched up . " <p> " I have n't heard a peep out of him all morning . I reckon he 's a heavy sleeper . " <p> " Well , pound on that door , if you please , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worrisome news on the wire . " <p> " I 'll see to it . And if that nigra does n't move fast enough for you , why you just give him a touch with your coach whip . I reckon he 'll jump to , then . You hear that , Cato ? " <p> " Yessuh . " The old man stepped a bit livelier at the threat . The coachman cracked his whip in Cato 's general direction and laughed when it made him jump as predicted . Lydell turned and pounded on the door to the stranger room . " Say , you in there . Your coach is fixing to leave . You up ? " <p> The wheel horses , now harnessed , stamped and snorted , tails flailing . August brings out the flies early . Cato held them close for a moment , cooing at them . The coachman set the long brake . <p> " Well , come along then , boy . Fetch out them other hosses . " <p> " ' Suh . " <p> The coach , stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were not well matched . In the old days , before the war , there would have been six , matched and fresh . But the war had taken all but the scrags . The stage line had to make do while its manager , Col. Michael Harman , fought the damyankees elsewhere . The two wheel horses , one gray and sway-backed , the other an ancient roan , its ribs clearly outlined through its shaggy , un-brushed pelt , stomped and nodded their massive heads impatiently . <p> Lydell pounded on the door again . " You there , your coach is about ready . It wo n't wait . " <p> " You 'd better open up that door , " the coachman said , and fed a withered apple to each of the horses . <p> " Door 's locked . " <p> " Ai n't you got a spare key ? " <p> Lydell removed a key from his coat pocket and held it up for the coachman to see . He tried it in the lock . <p> " He 's locked the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned . I ca n't turn her . " He pounded on the door again . <p> " I 've got that man 's goods on the top here . " The coachman pointed to the vehicle 's roof . " I 'll have to unload them . " He did n't look happy . " Try that key again , if you would , sir . " <p> Cato applied his shoulder to one of the wheel horses ' rump to straighten it out , adjusted its harness , and went for the leads . <p> Lydell wrenched the key back and forth . " No luck . Say , you do n't suppose he 's sick or something , do you ? He seemed fine last evening when he retired . " <p> " Ca n't say . Here , you boy , watch yourself , there . " Cato led the lead horses to the coach . They 'd drifted a bit turning the corner and pushed the coachman back a step . He laid the coiled whip on the old man 's bent frame . Not hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yessuh . Sorry , Suh . " <p> " Captain , there 's no connection between your stranger room and the rest of your house ... no window ? " <p> " No sir . Did n't see the need of a window for travelers and I surely do n't cotton to them imposing on my hospitality . If they wish to avoid the others in the inn , they may rent my room . If they feel the need of a window , well , there 's other rooms and houses . That 's all . If I know them , they may stay as my guest . But in these times ... well , sir , there 're deserters and Yankee spies aplenty . I do n't take chances ... Cato ! " <p> " Yessuh ? " <p> " You run fetch Big Henry and tell him to bring a log . I need this door broke down . " <p> " Yes Suh , Captain Lydell . " <p> " If he ai n't dead or damned near it , that fellow is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist to the heavy pine door again . <p> Cato and an enormous black man , carrying a six foot log that had to weigh at least eighty pounds , climbed the steps from the road and shuffled on bare feet down the length of the porch . The slave handled the log with no more effort than if it had been a tooth pick . <p> " Henry , you just swing that there log at the lock and bust this door open . " <p> Big Henry cradled the log and then took hold of its end . He took a deep breath , swung the length of it back and then forward at the door , which flew open with a crash and splintering of wood . <p> " Get in there and see what the fellow is up to , " Lydell said to Cato . <p> A pair of legs , booted , and still were all they could see with the early morning light in the front portion of the room . The old man crept in the darkened room . " Oh Lordy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight . " That man , he dead , Cap'n Lydell . " <p> " Dead ? What do you mean , he 's dead ? He ca n't be dead . He 's asleep or drunk , or both , you stupid nigger . " <p> " No suh . He 's a-lying there face up . They 's blood everywhere , and his eyes ... they dead man 's eyes . " <p> Lydell aimed a kick at the old man , but Big Henry stepped between them and took the blow instead . The look he gave Lydell would freeze a man 's soul . Lydell started to say something , saw the look , and turned away . The coachman had climbed the stairs by that time and peered into the room . Lydell lighted a lamp and they studied the dead man . <p> " Well , I do n't reckon he 'll be riding with us today . You , boy , get that travel trunk with the brass fittings on it down off the coach roof . " <p> " Yes Suh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'll leave it with you , Captain Lydell . I reckon you 'll be fetching the locals and they can figure this out . Key was stuck in the lock on the inside , you say ? " <p> " More'n I say . You can see for yourself . Turn that door around and have a look . " <p> The coachman did as he was told . " She 's still in there alright . I 'll have to write that in my paper work . Well , Captain , it looks like you got yoursdf a mystery on your hands . Who was that man , anyway ? " The two men entered the room and studied the corpse . <p> " Do n't know and do n't care . Wished I 'd never laid eyes on him . Cost me a very fine pine door , he did . Now I have to get some witnesses in here and make a determination as to the how of it . Though , for the life of me , I ca n't figure how someone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out with the door being locked on the inside and no other way in or out . " <p> " Fireplace ? " <p> " Only if our killer was thin as a snake . Franklin stove with a six inch flue . " <p> " Maybe he killed himself . " <p> " Does n't seem likely . Appears he 's been shot in the back , rolled over and maybe shot in the head to boot . I reckon there 's easier ways to kill yourself than that . " <p> " Well sir , as soon as that boy finishes harnessing them horses , I 'm off . I 'll be wishing you a good day , sir . " <p> The coachman descended to the muddy thoroughfare , picked his way through the puddles that dappled the road , and began haranguing Cato . Thirty minutes later , one passenger short and a brass studded trunk lighter , the coach rattled south toward Roanoke . It would be the last trip on this coach road until after General Philip Sheridan had scorched the valley in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable Robert E. Lee had taken up residency in Lexington . <p> * * * <p> THE STAUNTON SPECTATOR <p> August 23 , 1864 <p> Mysterious doings . We are in receipt of correspondence from Bolton Township to the south of us that a great mystery has been visited on that fair city . Captain Jonathan Lydell , Commander of the Home Guard , reports that a traveler resting for the night in his stranger room was found robbed and foully murdered . The method of the deed remains a mystery at this time . The room had no access to the rest of the house and the door was locked from the inside . The traveler is reported to have been a Mister Franklin Brian of undetermined address . He had no baggage and no apparent reason to be in the Valley in these perilous times . * * * <p> Sad news . Reports from Richmond describe the massacre of a company of General Jubal Early 's cavalry , under the command of Captain Lane Duckett , on the Covington road last week . Details are sketchy but early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to a detachment of Sheridan 's cavalry operating in the valley . In a surprise attack at dawn , the entire company of fifty-six good and loyal men was set upon and all killed , except for one brave bugler , Harry Percival , aged 14 , of Bristol , Tennessee . We sincerely hope the Yankees involved in this dastardly display of cowardice will soon suffer some of the same . Our brave General Early most recently viewed the sights of Washington in his last foray north . We await in anticipation his return to that dismal city and a proper lesson meted out . <p> * * * <p> A later bulletin from Bolton reports that a slave , Big Henry , a buck Negro known to be a hard case , was found with twenty Yankee greenback dollars and a map to Pennsylvania on his person shortly thereafter . The Home Guard took him into custody and promptly hung him for a traitor and an enemy collaborator . It should be a warning to any slave contemplating dealings with the Yankees . Slaves should be kept close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be tolerated . <p> Chapter Two Jonathan Lydell IV stood on his front porch and watched as the sun lumbered upward into the eastern sky , red and blurred . He gathered his coat around his shoulders against the early morning chill . He rubbed his eyes and extricated his glasses from his waistcoat pocket . A gold , and obviously new , new Cadillac with Michigan license plates pulled around from the parking lot at the rear of the building across the street . Someone had been calling his name . The car turned north toward Brownsburg . He peered across the street . Mrs. Antonelli waved to him . Antonelli , now there was a name that resonated oddly in the depths of Old Virginia . She and her husband had moved to Bolton two years previously from New Jersey , or some such place , and started a bed and breakfast in the old Cartwright House . That building began its life in the late eighteenth century as an inn on the coach road and now , after more than two centuries , had returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " <p> He did not like being addressed by his Christian name . He considered informality an unwelcome intrusion into the culture , but something to which the valley 's newcomers seemed addicted . There were forms of address that were correct , he believed , and modern casualness irritated him immensely . At least Mrs. Antonelli refrained from calling him Jon like that odious Wilson woman down the street . <p> " Yes , Mrs. Antonelli , I can hear you . " <p> " Well , you might try to wake your lodger . He asked me specifically to call him before six . His breakfast is ready . " <p> " I will knock on his door , Mrs. Antonelli . " Lydell tapped on the door . No response . He knocked harder . " You awake in there ? " Still no response . " I 'm afraid I can not rouse him , Mrs. Antonelli . Perhaps you should defer his breakfast until later . " <p> Rose Antonelli frowned , and sighed . " I will see to my other guests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lydell nodded , and reentered his house . <p> * * * <p> By ten , at Rose Antonelli 's worried insistence , Jonathan Lydell had tried several times to rouse Anton Grotz . She began to pound on the door as well . <p> " Jonathan , I think we should open this door and see what the trouble is . " <p> " Door 's locked , Mrs. Antonelli . " <p> " Call me Rose . Do n't you have a spare key ? " <p> " I do . " He went into the house and returned with a large iron key that had to be at least two hundred years old . <p> " My word , that must be the original . " <p> " When I restored the house and the stranger room , I retrieved many of the original locks and keys . " He attempted to insert the key in the lock . " It 's locked from the inside and that key 's still in there . I can not unlock the door . " <p> " There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . When I set out to restore the house , I sealed this room off from the remainder-part of the whole project to qualify for my historical plaque . " He nodded toward the signage on the front of the house . <p> Rose pounded on the door with her fist . " Mr. Grotz , are you all right ? Mr. Grotz ? " <p> Lydell stood back and scratched his head . " You know , this is very odd . " <p> " Mr. Grotz , are you in there ? " <p> " Of course he 's in there . The key is in the lock on the inside . I 'll have to have this door broken down . " He walked to the end of the porch and leaned over the rail . " Henry ? You there ? " <p> A wiry twenty-something with a long , spiked Mohawk haircut and goatee , both dyed scarlet , strolled to the street . " Yo . Wassup ? " <p> " Henry , get a log or something and come on up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Henry climbed the steps with what appeared to be a log , a leftover from a cabin . <p> " How do you want me to do this ? " <p> " Henry , I do n't want to splinter that door so just aim at the lock , there , and bang it open . " <p> " What ? At the lock , not the panel ? " <p> " Yes , yes . That lock is n't mortised in and the receiver-the place where the bolt goes is n't either so ... " <p> " I got it . Step back , Mrs. Antonelli . " <p> Henry swung the log back and then forward . On the second try the door smacked open . <p> Rose pushed into the room . " Oh , my God , Jonathan , call 9-1-1 . This man is hurt . " Anton Grotz lay face down on a frayed prayer rug , the back of his head a bloody mess . Henry knelt next to the body and felt for a pulse . <p> " You need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . He 's been shot . " <p> " Suicide ? " Rose asked . Her knees began to buckle . " Oh my God . " <p> " That 's for the sheriff to say , but he 's been shot in the back three times , it appears , and it do n't seem likely he 'd practice on his back before putting the gun to his head . " Henry , bright red hair notwithstanding , seemed to have a fundamental grasp of forensics . <p> Rose Antonelli collapsed onto a damask settee . <p> * * * <p> " Where 're we headed ? " Karl Hedrick held the wheel of the cruiser lightly and kept his eyes on the road . <p> " Turn here , " Ike directed . " This is Old Coach Road . It used to be the main drag north and south for commercial travelers . The valley was connected by stage coaches up through the War Between the States .

Picketsville gained enough prominence to outrank it and finally incorporate Bolton as a suburb . " <p> " Suburb ? " Karl said with a smile . " Ike , with respect , Picketsville is hardly an ' urb . ' Having a sub urb is a stretch . " <p> " Nevertheless . Bolton is an old section , with homes dating to the early nineteenth century , and the house we are going to belongs to Jonathan Lydell . He is Old Valley . " <p> " Meaning what ? " <p> " His family has been in the valley for God only knows how many generations , living in the same house , even . He is FFV , DAR , the Society of the Cincinnati , and on and on . " <p> " FFV means what , exactly ? " <p> " Where do you come from , Karl ? " <p> " Originally or lately ?

And no , they had enough trouble without that . " <p> " My grandma used to say our family was related to Thomas Jefferson . Could I be an FFV ? " <p> " A word of advice .
