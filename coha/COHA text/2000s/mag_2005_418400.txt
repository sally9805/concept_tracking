The true story of the albino racoon , the pig farmer and the only NUCLEAR BOMB ever to be dropped on America // Soybeans scatter . The pig farmer is attempting to move thirty thousand pounds of soybeans from his grain bin into the back of a truck . He 's using two machines to do this . The first machine spins an auger thatpulls soybeans out of the bin and onto abigblue tarp . The second machine sucks the soybeans off the big blue tarp and up through a sixty-foot-long tube , one end of which the farmer has positioned over the truck 's open trailer . But there 's a problem : The soybeans are streaming from the bin so fast that a lot of them angle right into one of the wheels that drive the machines . When that happens , the soybeans scatter , spraying randomly in all directions and landing , uselessly , on the grass beyond the tarp . The farmer wants to figure out a way to keep the soybeans from scattering , but he 's wary of tinkering with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too close to the second machine . It caught the sleeve of his jacket and ripped it off him so fast , he did n't have time to think . Then it pulled his arm inside . It gnawed and bit and crushed . Now the farmer lacks a thumb , two fingertips , and some of his right forearm 's muscle . Walking too close to the machine had been one of those perfectly understandable mistakes you make in an instant and regret for a lifetime . This is a story about another perfectly understandable mistake . It 's a story about a mistake someone made on a Tuesday afternoon forty-seven years ago , fifteen thousand feet above where the farmer is puzzling over his scattering soybeans . On that day , in a careless instant , a small man in a big plane made history . The farmer gained something from that man 's mistake . It 's something he 's not sure he should own . He thinks maybe the government would take it away from him if it knew he had it . It might be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a plan to keep his soybeans from scattering . He finds several flat sheets of metal and arranges them so they lean against one another like playing cards in a card castle , forming a barrier around the machines . The soybeans that would have flown away now bounce off one wall , two walls , three walls , before collapsing , spent , onto the big blue tarp . Sometimes , always at random , within the ricocheting flurry , there are collisions . The collisions were about to begin . The prototype of the Mk-6 device sat on top of a three-hundred-foot-tall tower in the Enewetok Atoll . It was 6:34 on the morning of April 8,1951 . A few shakes earlier , someone had sent a signal to the Mk-6 , and sixty panels of high-energy explosives inside it had detonated around a hollow sphere of uranium and plutonium . People who study really fast things define a shake as a hundred millionth of a second . The shock waves from the high-energy explosives began collapsing the hollow sphere of uranium and plutonium until it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the very center of the sphere was the " initiator " -a tiny piece of beryllium . As the walls closed in around the beryllium , it reacted by spitting out neutrons . One of those neutrons collided with the nucleus of one of the atoms in the crushed sphere . The nucleus split , releasing a tiny jolt of pure energy and a few neutrons of its own . These neutrons flew off into the dense atomic forest . There were more collisions . And so on . A man who watched what happened next described it like this : " The predawn darkness was rent with a brilliance greater than noon , and the islands of the atoll shook with the force of the blast . " Beryllium , the metal seed that initiated the spectacle , is named after beryl , a mineral . Beryl takes its name from an ancient Greek word , beryllos , from which we also derive the English word brilliance . He was brilliant , and his Sister 's name was Beryl . Forty-seven years ago , Beryl 's brilliant brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a perfectly understandable mistake , stood in the cramped bomb bay of a B-47 strategic bomber and wondered what to do . Along with Captain Bruce Kulka , the bomb bay contained a single Mk-6 nuclear bomb . The bomb hung from its harness . It was ten feet eight inches long , five feet in diameter , and weighed seventy-six hundred pounds . Something was wrong with the harness that held the bomb . Bruce did n't know exactly how to fix it . The B-47 was fifteen thousand feet above a rural area near Florence , South Carolina . It had taken off from Hunter Air Force Base in Savannah less than an hour before , along with a few other B - 47 's from the 308th Bombardment Wing . The planes were participating in a mission called Operation Snow Flurry . They were supposed to fly to England and pretend to drop bombs on various targets there . Electronic receivers on the ground would receive signals from the B-47 's , and that data would later be used to determine the accuracy of the mock bombing runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be prepared to ditch the mock bombing runs and head to Russia were World War III to suddenly break out . Bruce was abombardier and a navigator . That meant it was his job to help the pilot find particular targets and , once he found them , either pretend to destroy them or really destroy them , depending on the mission . He was a good bombardier and a good navigator . One person who flew with him called him " the most brilliant navigator I ever flew with . " He was also perhaps a little strange . He kept to himself . He hardly ever attended parties on the base . He swung both arms at the same time , parallel to each other , when he walked . He told people he had gone to MIT , and sometimes they did n't believe him , but it was true . He had studied chemical engineering there . Bruce was in the bomb bay because the pilot sent him there . He sent him there because when the copilot had pulled a lever that was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure for the transatlantic trip , nothing had happened . A light in the cockpit indicated the pin had not engaged . The pilot wanted Bruce to figure out what was wrong and fix it . The bomb was very big , and Bruce was pretty short . At the time , in the late 1950s , almost all nuclear weapons were very big . They were so big and bulbous and heavy that the people who worked with them , people like Bruce and the pilot and the copilot , usually referred to them not as bombs but as pigs , as in , " There 's something wrong with the pig 's harness . " The fact that the pig was big and Bruce was short makes the perfectly understandable mistake he was about to make even more understandable . Bruce could n't see the top of the bomb . If he could see the top of the bomb , maybe he could see what was wrong with the harness . Maybe he could see the locking pin . Maybe he could figure out why the locking pin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward against the smooth , green-painted surface of the bomb 's nose . The nose was a slow curve . He stretched , reaching up and over the top of the bomb as far as he could , feeling around with his gloveless , bare fingers . Bruce 's hand fell on something and his fingers closed on it and he was planning to pull himself up and look at the harness and see what was wrong , and that 's exactly what he would have done had his fingers fallen on something other than the bomb 's emergency-release lever . The bomb clanged down onto the bomb-bay doors , and Bruce sprawled face-forward onto it . The combined weight of Bruce and the bomb started forcing the doors open . " I would n't even try to imagine what he was feeling in those seconds , " the copilot later remarked . The doors opened all the way and the pig fell free . Bruce reached out to grab something , and this time it was a good solid something , not something like an emergency-release lever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce was alive . Bruce is alive . He survived the bomb drop . He survived reenacting his perfectly understandable mistake over and over again for accident-review-board investigators . He survived the nickname-Nuclear Nav-that other people in the Air Force began calling him behind his back . He survived another war , a hot war , and in that war , in Vietnam , according to people he served with , he participated in an operation called Ranch Hand that dumped Agent Orange on jungles . But always , wherever he went , for the rest of his military career , word would get out that Bruce was the man who had dropped an atomic bomb on the United States . According to the copilot of the B-47 from which Bruce dropped that atomic bomb , Bruce had said exactly one thing during the two and a half hours that the plane had spent burning off excess fuel before landing back at Hunter Air Force Base . " We 'd be better off going to Brazil , " Bruce had said . Bruce lives in Thailand now , another country where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasts . When he occasionally returns to the United States , he lives in a hotel on the West Coast that rents rooms by the month . He recently received four letters requesting an interview , and he sent one curt letter in return . He does not want to tell his story . The story behind the albi no raccoon that hangs on the pig farmer 's living-room wall is that the farmer did n't know it was an albino until he 'd killed it . When the dog treed the coon and they shone the light up at it , all they could see were its red eyes shining back through the piney branches . Was n't until he 'd put a bullet in it and it was on the ground that he saw it was albino . He 'd never seen an albino raccoon . Neither had his father , and his father had been hunting raccoons for seventy-five years . So the farmer took the raccoon to a lady who stuffed it and replaced its real red eyes with fake red eyes and wired its paws to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap-white except for faint rust-colored stripes here and there , and the whiteness is so unexpected that you 'd be forgiven for not recognizing it as a raccoon at all the first time you see it . When the farmer killed the albino raccoon , he was the only person he 'd ever heard of who had seen one . Then , a few years later , a friend of his who was hunting in the area saw another albino raccoon . Must be something in the genes of the raccoons around there . Still , it 's a rare animal , and he 's proud of it . He has something else that 's even more rare . He 's kind of proud of it , too , though he does n't talk about it much , because he 's worried someone might take it away from him . He 's had it for a long time , ever since a man made a perfectly understandable mistake and dropped an atomic bomb into the woods near his uncle Bill 's house . Walter " Bill " Gregg once built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the trees around it were sturdy , though the ground they occupied was not . A Department of Agriculture survey map labeled some of the woods behind the house " Cv , " which stands for Coxville , a type of soil that drains poorly and sometimes , depending on the time of year , is sort of swampy . So when an atomic bomb plummeted out of the sky on March 11,1958 , at the end of the rainy season , the first thing it did was burrow deep into the soft , wet earth like some enormous and ravenous mole . The second thing it did was explode . When the bomb fell , at around 4:34 P.M. , there were eight people in its immediate vicinity . Bill was in a shed near his house , repairing a wooden bench . His six-year-old son , Walter Jr. , was there with him . Bill 's wife , Effie , was in the house , sewing . Nine-year-old Frances Gregg and six-year-old Helen Gregg were at the edge of the woods , playing with their nine-year-old cousin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coker , was in the yard , too , pulling a barrel full of trash . Her husband , Jack , had just driven onto the property to pick her up . And then ... One thing about nuclear bombs is they can go off without really going off . For this bomb to have really gone off , it would have had to contain its grapefruit-sized removable core of fissionable plutonium and uranium . It did not . The core was still fifteen thousand feet above the ground , secure in its so-called bird-cage , a metal container fixed inside the B-47 where Captain Bruce Kulka was holding on for his life . What the bomb did contain , apart from radar fuses and barometric switches and loading coils and all sorts of other components , the precise descriptions of which remain classified , was thousands of pounds of high-energy conventional explosives . These detonated powerfully enough to carve a seventy-five-foot-wide and twenty-five-foot-deep crater in the ground and send a mushroom-shaped plume of smoke and dirt and metal and wood up high enough to be seen from the roof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less soggy , causing the bomb to detonate closer to the surface , the blast would have almost certainly killed everyone present . As it was , nobody died . The explosion flattened the loblolly pine trees around the impact site so that they radiated out like spokes on an inside-out bicycle wheel , then tore into the people , flinging them all to the ground . A board with nails in it smacked Bill Gregg in his side . Something ripped a gash in his wife 's left temple . Catherine Coker hit the ground hard enough to sprain her back . Debris traced a deep , long cut in Ella Davies 's forehead . Somehow , the Greggs ' property sustained more physical damage than the Greggs themselves . The shock wave and the debris that surfed it reached the Gregg children 's playhouse first , about sixty-five feet from the crater , and erased it . Next , the blast totaled the Gregg family 's 1946 Chevy sedan and Chevy half-ton pick-up , then proceeded to knock the Greggs ' house off its foundation and destroy nearly everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television , their Duncan Phyfe sofa , their Samsonite card table , their thirty quart cans of snap beans , their twenty-five dollars ' worth of artificial flowers , their Westinghouse coffeemaker , their **52;2720;TOOLONG . As thoughts poked up after the first few moments of pure shock , the bombing victims wondered what had happened . Bill Gregg thought a plane had crashed . Ella Davies thought the Russians had attacked . And a little ways away , L. E. Kirby , owner of a general store by the nearby railroad tracks , thought a thought that was both fantastic and true : " It sounded like one of them atomic bombs . " The pig farmer does n't remember any sounds but rather an unusual sensation . He was sitting in his kitchen with both his parents when the shock wave emanating from his uncle 's property plowed its way across the quarter mile or so of fields between them . He had been home sick from school , and his father had just come in , like he always did this time of day , this time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before heading back out to his tractor . Then , suddenly , it felt as if the house jumped a few feet off the ground and dropped right back down . Plaster split . Commodes cracked . He was six and a half years old , and if he had n't been sick that day , he would have been at his uncle 's place himself , playing with his uncle 's kids and Ella Davies , another cousin . Sometimes it seemed as if everybody here in Mars Bluff was his cousin . Back before the War Between the States , the farmer 's great-grandfather Walter Gregg owned a cotton plantation that covered most of the land around here . He had four sons and three daughters , and when they were old enough and married enough , he divided his land up and gave them each a piece . Many of the daughters stayed on the land with their new husbands and their new names , so a lot of the different names you found around Mars Bluff-Hunt , Davies , Sallenger , Beaty-belonged to people who traced their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even a lot of the black people who lived in the area , they were Greggs , too , on account of how things worked back in the plantation days , when slaves took their owners ' names . You could head up Harlem Road in Mars Bluff and still find black people with the last name Gregg living around there . The farmer does n't remember the sound the bomb made , but he will never forgetthat brief and strange sensation of his home rising up and dropping down . After the Stra ngeneSS , the strangers came . The South Carolina state troopers came first and then the Civil Air Patrol and then the local press and then the National Guard and then the Air Force and then the international press and then the gawkers from out of town , and then it just seemed as if everybody in the world was right there in Mars Bluff , and if they were n't in Mars Bluff , they were talking about it . They talked about it in London , where members of Parliament demanded an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lest somethingsimilar happen there . They talked about it in Washington , where a congressman said that what happened in Mars Bluff showed that an eventual accidental , full-fledged nuclear detonation within the United States was " probable . " They talked about it in Moscow , where the Soviets issued a statement over one of their state-controlled radio stations warning that had the bomb detonated the way it was designed to , it would have triggered World War III , since the U. S. would have retaliated for the blast before it realized that it had been self-inflicted . The United States , for its part , had made use of a radio station , too , one that broadcast into Mars Bluff . Air Force Major General Charles Dougher , who had taken control of the recovery and cleanup operation , issued a statement assuring that there was " no danger of radioactive contamination . " At the same time , the Air Force warned , it was imperative that anyone who found any " harmless but highly secret fragments " of the bomb return them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military had cordoned off a two-square-mile area around Mars Bluff . Special cleanup crews flew in from around the country to tackle the novel situation . A newsman observed a mysterious " lead casket " being hauled toward the crater . Geiger counters and metal detectors were everywhere . Major General Dougher visited nine-year-old Ella Davies in the hospital , where she had received thirty-one stitches in her forehead . She was the only one of the bombing victims whose injuries had necessitated an overnight stay , and Major General Dougher wanted to express his regrets to her personally . He brought Ella some ice cream and a gift , a copy of Dr. Seuss 's book Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose . " A host has to put up with all kinds of pests , " Thidwick says in the book . " For a host , above all , must be nice to his guests . " Southern hospitality goes only so far . TWO years after Mars Bluff received its unexpected visit from an atomic bomb , the now eleven-year-old Ella Davies filed a civil suit against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of Bill Gregg 's family and their cleaning lady . These lawsuits had been a longtime coming . The day after the accident , the Air Force had assured the bombing victims that they would be compensated for whatever damages they 'd sustained . It got specific . For example , Colonel J. E. Carmack , of Hunter Air Force Base , said this : " The crater will be filled in . " More than a year later , the Air Force cleanup crews were long gone and the crater remained . Bill Gregghad initially been remarkably good-natured about the destruction of his home and the damage to his family , joking to reporters that " I always wanted a swimming pool and now I 've got the hole for one at no cost . " At first , the Greggs enjoyed some of the attention they received , especially when they got to go up to New York City a few weeks after the bomb dropped to film an episode of the CBS prime-time game show I 've Got a secret . The producers enlisted a panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while flashing their " secret " - Our House Was Hit by an Atom Bomb-up on the screen for the at-home audience to see . Nobody on the panel guessed right , and the Greggs won eighty dollars . Eventually , though , the novelty wore off . Bill Gregg , a conductor for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad , found himself unable to muster the stamina and concentration he needed for his job and was out of work for six months . He 'd also become hard of hearing . His three children had begun sufferingfrom unusually frequent bouts of bed-wetting and nightmares , and their young son , Walter Jr. , had developed crossed eyes shortly after the accident , a condition the Greggs believed was due to the trauma of the bomb blast . His wife , who now had severe chronic headaches on the left side of her face , where flying debris had injured her , insisted the family move away from Mars Bluff . They relocated to a newly built and much smaller house in Florence , about eight miles from the ruins of their old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun having unusually long and painful menstrual periods , as well as lingering neck and back pain . Little Ella Davies , whose family also moved to Florence shortly after the bombing , had to go back to the hospital for an operation to repair an abdominal hernia that her family blamed on the shock wave from the bomb . So , months after the accident , when the Air Force claims officer finally finished tabulating the damage and made his initial offers of compensation , the bombing victims balked at the amounts and hired a local lawyer . None of the suits went to trial . The largest , the one filed by the Greggs , demanded $156,000 instead of the $44,000 the Air Force had offered . The United States eventually settled out of court for $56,000 . Ella Davies 's settlement was much smaller ; it went into a trust , and years later , when she was able to access it , the amount was enough for her to purchase her first car , a brand-new 1971 Toyota Corolla . The smallest settlement went to Catherine Coker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $400 of which went directly to her lawyer . The pig farmer receives $100 for each pighe sells , $30 of which goes directly to a butcher who kills the pigs by slitting their throats and then dunks their corpses in barrels of boiling water to loosen their bristly hair . The typical pig the pig farmer sells is five months old , weighs about 140 pounds , and has consumed approximately sixty dollars ' worth of feed during its short lifetime . It 's not easy to make a profit . Back when the bomb fell , when the pig farmer was still just six years old and not yet a pig farmer but rather just a cow farmer 's son , he had not sued the United States of America like his cousins had . But the bomb had affected him , too , since the Gregg kids and Ella Davies had been his main playmates and then they had suddenly moved away . Without them around , he had had to find new ways of amusing himself . One of his favorite new ways to amuse himself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( His father grew corn to supplement the family 's cow-related income , much as he now grows soybeans to supplement his own family 's pig-related income . ) The earth would flip up all soft and new behind the plow , and the boy learned that a sharp eye could sometimes find old Indian arrowheads in the fresh dirt . He collected them . And sometimes , following behind his father as hidden earth tumbled up into daylight , he found other things as well . Many of the arrowheads the pig farmer collected as a boy now sit one room over from where his albino raccoon hangs on a wall . The arrowheads cluster on the shelves of a three-foot-high display case . A large stuffed beaver sits atop the case , and tucked beneath the beaver 's tumescent belly is one more hard and sharp and jagged thing the farmer found while following behind his father 's plow . It is not another head of an arrow , though it might be part of abrokenone . Military jargon Classifies nuclear-weapons accidents according to three evocative names : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broken Arrows are the most serious category , referring to the destruction or detonation of a nuclear weapon . There has never been an accidental full-fledged nuclear detonation , but partial detonations , like the one in Mars Bluff , have been reported six times in the United States . Three of those were on military bases , and two of the off-base detonations were in unpopulated areas . The Mk-6 that destroyed Bill Gregg 's home is the only nuclear device ever to be dropped on a civilian community in America , a fact that gives Mars Bluff a strange , muted kinship with Hiroshima and Nagasaki . I first heard about the incident at Mars Bluff from an acquaintance of mine , a nuke-obsessed old fisherman in Savannah who once showed me a shoddy videotape of a pilgrimage he 'd made to Captain Kulka 's crater . The crater , he told me , was probably still there . It is . Today the crater sits , unmemorialized , in the woods behind a new housing development named Francis Marion Forest : An Exclusive Manufactured Home Community . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the crater 's lip , before the earth falls away toward a shallow pool of black water , a thick chain lashes the partially decomposed carcass of a pit bull to the roots of a pine tree . I spent most of a month in Mars Bluff talking with all sorts of people who 'd been affected by the bomb in all sorts of small and unexpected ways , like a lady whose hens stopped laying eggs for a couple of weeks because the military had n't allowed feed trucks into the neighborhood , and no feed means no eggs . I met with the Gregg family . They are all still alive , and most of them are still bitter . I had coffee with a local newspaper photographer who 'd been on the scene less than an hour after the bomb fell , and he asked me if I believed in numerology , because he thought it was significant that I was working on this story now , exactly forty-seven years after the B-47 flew overhead . And then one day , as I made my rounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c AND A HOG FARM . When I met the farmer , I asked him if he 'd been around when the bomb fell , and he said yes , and he started telling the story about how his house had jumped . He told me about visiting the crater shortly after the blast and how he 'd been impressed by how smooth its sides had been , " like it was dug up with a backhoe . " He told me about finding a piece of the bomb in the woods that same day , abig chunk of metal lousy with wires , and he remembered walking up to a man in a military uniform and handing it over , like the radio had told him to . We talked for a long time , about the bomb and the recovery efforts and all that followed , and then he stopped , as if he was n't sure if he should go on . " Actually , " he said , " I 've got a piece of it . " Until then , everything I 'd read about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wayward weapon . I 'd already talked to other people who had found pieces of the bomb back when it fell , but they 'd all said they had either turned them in or had them confiscated . I had no reason to believe that any fragments remained . After the pig farmer told me about his alleged piece of the bomb , he gave me some leads on finding other people who might also still have pieces . Over the next couple of days , I tracked down eight supposed bomb shards near Mars Bluff , two more that had migrated with a woman to a town near Myrtle Beach , and one that had moved with another woman up to Maryland . If they were what their owners claimed them to be , they were unique artifacts , perhaps the only atomic-weapon shrapnel in civilian hands . But the thing was , how to prove it ? My editor sent me a Geiger counter . The question of whether the Mars Bluff bomb contained radioactive material has a complicated answer . The Air Force , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contamination . " But in the National Archives and Records Administration warehouse near Atlanta , in the documents for the civil suits that the Greggs and others filed against the government , there is a four-page-long interrogatory in which the government 's lawyer , responding to a series of questions posed by the plaintiffs ' attorney , stated that the " radioactive element which fell from the Air Force Plane was uranium . This material was an integral part of the weapon component . " The lawyer had refused to provide more details , probably because in the 1950s the precise designs of nuclear weapons were even more secret than they are now . ( Government secrecy in 1958 often reached absurd levels . For example , the Department of Labor refused to reveal to the public how much peanut butter the military had purchased that year , for fear that with such information , " the Russians could deduce the number of men in the U. S. Armed Forces . " ) Today , declassified documents reveal some , if not all , of the once secret details regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb contained a so-called tamper consisting of 120 pounds of uranium . In a nuclear detonation , this tamper , which operates on basically the same principle as the sheets of metal the pig farmer used to contain his scattering soybeans , would " reflect " some of the neutrons that might otherwise escape the fissioning core of the weapon , increasingthe bomb 's overall yield . According to one nuclear-weapons specialist I exchanged e-mails with , the uranium tamper was an integral part of the weapon that was always present , even when the removable core was absent . With that in mind , I set out to test the fragments with the Geiger counter , reasoning that if they were what they were supposed to be , they should still contain traces of uranium . ( Although uranium is a naturally occurring element and is minutely present just about everywhere , concentrations high enough for a Geiger counter to detect are rarely found in nature . ) Over the next couple of days , in various rooms around South Carolina , with various people who had what they believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of torn and charred and twisted metal , and the Geiger counter found them all to be as inert as the air around them , with none registering significantly above background radiation levels . This did not surprise the owners of the fragments , who had more or less accepted the Air Force 's claims regarding the lack of radioactive contamination . As for me , the Geiger counter led me to doubt these were really bomb fragments at all . And then I went back to the C and A Hog Farm to test the pig farmer 's purported piece of pig . It weighs about as much as a pork chop , is approximately the size of my hand , and looks a little like a map of Australia . One side is fairly smooth , and its surface buckles out toward a jagged edge , as though a tremendous force had once applied itself to the other side , which is pitted and chaotic . Looking closely at the smooth side , I can see little flecks of what looks like green paint . I move the Geiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . I move it slowly up the smooth side , over the flecks of green paint . Still nothing . I reach the jagged edge and move the sensor to the other side . The Geiger counter starts ticking like a playing card in the spokes of a kid 's bike . I nearly drop the fragment . The farmer takes a step back and laughs for a few moments , eyes wide . Then he stops laughing . " I wonder , " he says , " what the safe level is on that thing . " South Carolina , the country 's thirteenth-poorest state , happens to be rich in radiation-safety experts . This is because there is a demand for them . The Savannah River Site , one of the world 's largest repositories of nuclear waste , employs more people than any other business in South Carolina except Wal-Mart , which is perhaps why Francis Marion University , a small school in Florence , offers students degrees in health physics , the branch of science that deals with radiation safety . The farmer and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation lab . The professor had been eager to examine the fragment , and when the farmer extricates it from a plastic supermarket bag and hands it to him , he immediately gets to work . He places it inside what looks like a small kiln built out of stacked lead bricks , then inserts the end of abeer-kegsized " germanium detector " into the kiln . A germanium detector , he explains , is similar to a Geiger counter , although whereas Geiger counters detect only radiation 's presence , germanium detectors detect radiation 's provenance-namely , what specific radioactive element is causing the radiation . The professor warns that it could take a while , even overnight , to glean any useful results , but a few minutes into the process he seems to take great interest in the graph emerging on his PC screen . " I have to admit , when you first called me , I thought you might just bring me a chunk of metal that someone had smeared with americium from a smoke detector , " he says , pointing at the graph 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He quickly assures us that uranium is more or less safe to have around , so long as you do n't eat it , inhale it , or sleep with it under your pillow . Within a few minutes , the chairman of the university 's physics department arrives and starts taking pictures with a digital camera . Though he holds a doctorate in nuclear physics and sits on the Governor 's Nuclear Advisory Council , he has " never seen one of these before . " As the scientists continue their giddy analysis of the farmer 's fragment , he excuses himself . Three customers are waiting on him back at the farm . He has pigs to sell . Should he sell his piece of pig ? He 's been thinking about it since our trip to the lab . I mean , he 's had the thing for forty-seven years now , shepherded it through his entire adult life , and it would be a shame to get rid of it , but if somebody offered him a lot of money , well , you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money for things that did n't seem like they were worth anything at all . The same day we went to the lab , USA Today had a story about a Styrofoam cup Elvis once drank from that someone was trying to sell for thousands of dollars . He 's been thinking maybe he should n't keep the fragment under his beaver anymore . Maybe he should go to the bank , get himself a safe deposit box , keep it there until he decides what to do . " This is the one thing I have that nobody else has , " he explains . The farmer was talking with his son yesterday , and his son gave him some advice . The advice had to do with eBay . The farmer reckons he might take his . son 's advice . He 's always been a little worried about the Air Force , concerned it might show up on his doorstep , try to take his piece of pig away from him . But the thing is , ever since he heard the Geiger counter ticking and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to think the Air Force might decide it 's not in its best interest to make a fuss . Word about his fragment 's radioactivity has spread through Mars Bluff like word spreads about everything here , fast , and some folks are starting to ask questions they 'd never really asked before . A relative of Ella Davies recalls that a man in uniform swiped some sort of detector over the little girl 's torn forehead when the girl was in the hospital , and the detector started ticking . Nobody paid much attention at the time . That was a different era . You trusted the higher-ups more in 1958 , a year when people like Edward Teller , the guy behind the H-bomb , said that all mutations caused by man-made radiation are not necessarily bad . That was a long time before Geraldo and 20/20 and 60 Minutes , and now the farmer 's neighbors in Mars Bluff are all of a sudden starting to wonder about things like the fact that the first local guy who climbed into the crater after the bomb fell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick cloud of yellow dust , ended up dying of bone cancer . Of course , it is still possible that today , forty-seven years after Captain Bruce KuIka made a perfectly understandable mistake and dropped an atomic bomb on Mars Bluff , the Air Force could come back here and stir things up again . It could cause a ruckus and take the farmer to court and try to get back the one thing he has that nobody else has . The Air Force could certainly do that . It would be a perfectly understandable mistake . <p>
