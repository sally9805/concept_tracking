<p> Shallow attack on N.H. <p> Re : ' Do n't look to Northeast , ' Jan. 22 Open Forum . <p> I have never read a more shallow perspective and lack of comprehension for this great political system . What is the point of David Price 's letter ? To suggest that New Hampshire has ' little or no industry ' is almost as one-dimensional as someone suggesting that Colorado provides an extremely poor education to its youth , as evidenced by one letter-writer 's superficial commentary . How much time has Price spent talking to people from New Hampshire to develop such a well-rounded perspective on how we vote ? <p> He did get one point correct : New Hampshire is considered a small state based on its geographic constraints . Is this the point Price was trying to articulate , or is everything summarized in how people feel regarding the size of things ? <p> DAVE MAGEE <p> Lebanon , N.H. <p> History revision ? <p> Re : ' Science museum 's CEO resigns , ' Jan. 22 news story . <p> I read with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature and Science CEO Raylene Decatur . While the article was quite informative , it did leave me with one important question : Can we start using the museum 's real name again ? <p> DAN DISNER <p> Denver <p> Read the bill <p> Re : ' Kill the easy-gun bill , ' Jan. 22 editorial . <p> I read your rant against state Rep. Ray Rose 's bill amending Amendment 22 ( HB 1012 ) , which is obviously more than you did with the bill prior to turning your editorial pencil amok . <p> According to the editorial , Rose 's bill would make it easier for people to avoid doing background checks on firearms sales at gun shows . Not true , at all . The bill does two things , both of which are needed . It clarifies the term ' collection , ' which is horribly miswritten , defining it as a trade , barter or in-kind exchange of one or more firearms . Does that make any sort of sense to you ? It certainly does n't to me . The bill removes that definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply does n't call them a ' collection . ' <p> The other item is the deletion of the phrase ' or attempts to transfer ' from the requirement that a gun-show vendor first obtain an instant background check before transferring a firearm at a gun show . It does not remove the requirement . It simply removes the felony penalty for some poor jerk who may not know the law , or may have moved into the state after its enactment . If someone attempts to make such a sale , he may be stopped and forced to undergo the check . That part of the law does n't change . It just keeps an uninformed citizen from getting a felony conviction on his record simply because he does n't know or understand the law . If he completes such a transfer , he is still subject to felony prosecution . Why felonize someone who is uninformed for the simple mistake of attempting such a sale ? The end result is the same , and does n't weaken the law one whit . <p> BILL DIETRICK <p> Thornton <p> Double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face , ' just like last year 's school voucher bill did . The voters said ' no ' to vouchers twice . <p> The Post 's editorial staff did not seem to think that the voucher bill was an affront to the citizens of Colorado . You endorsed it . <p> You ca n't have it both ways . But then it is an election year . I hope you do n't criticize any politicians for switching their positions on issues . <p> ANN SULLIVAN <p> Centennial <p> A case of the bland leading the bland <p> Cut it out ! <p> The deaf and the blind are easy targets for the cheap shots of linguistically challenged political poltroons and imagination-deprived media morons . <p> First we had a fired , bitter Treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , opining that our president is ' like a blind man in a room full of deaf people . ' <p> Then came and still come the pundits oohing and aahing outward disapproval . Repeating these words , they reveal their own hitherto hidden inward beliefs ( negative ) of the abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have former Colorado Gov . Dick Lamm chiming in ( Jan. 18 Perspective article ) that ' bipartisan dialogue is a conversation between the blind and the deaf . ' <p> Has n't Lamm now reached the age of his own dictum that the aged have ' a duty to die ' ? No matter . <p> Could n't kinder , jollier , more apt yet equally inept analogies be used ? Say , ' The president is like a Latino lover in a room full of WASPs , ' or , ' Bipartisan dialogue is a conversation between the Muslims and the Mormons . ' <p> We 've heard of ' dialogue of the deaf ' and seen ' the blind leading the blind . ' For politicians and pundits these days , it 's more a case of the bland leading the bland or , worse , of the dialogue of the brain dead . <p> DAVID A. ANTHONY <p> Boulder <p> Israelis have one home <p> Re : ' War of ideas , Part IV , ' Jan. 20 Thomas Friedman column . <p> I propose an alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way ' by giving up more and more of its land . Alternatively , the Arabs could fulfill their obligations from 1948 to resettle their Arab so-called refugee brethren from that era . I thought that Jordan was actually designated for that purpose ? Israelis and Jews the world over have only one place to call home . The Arabs have some 23 countries , covering 10 percent of the Earth 's land surface , most of which is unpopulated . Could n't Israel be left to enjoy the minuscule spot on Earth it has inherited without the likes of Friedman and the Arabs gouging it any further ? <p> NATALIE EILAM <p> Denver <p> Not everyone supports troops ' actions in Iraq <p> Re : ' United when it counts , ' Jan. 21 editorial . <p> The Post writes in its editorial that ' the American people are united in support of the brave men and women of our armed forces as they guard the ramparts of freedom throughout the world . ' I for one do not support them if it means approving of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pre-emptive aggression by the U.S. against Iraq , a small , Third World country that posed no threat to this country . They have destabilized the Middle East by arousing an insurgency that may involve this country for decades . They have rounded up thousands of Iraqis with no legal recourse on suspicion of opposing the U.S. occupation and put them in concentration camps . Thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians have been killed and injured by the indiscriminate weaponry used by the U.S. military to avoid American casualties . Even so , at some point , as U.S. casualties mount , the country will have to pull out like it did during Vietnam . <p> PHILIP S. MILLER <p> Telluride <p> Water agency should clamp down more on usage <p> Re : ' Time for anti-drought steps , ' Jan. 20 editorial . <p> Thank you for encouraging Denver Water to implement water restrictions in a timely and well-planned effort . It seems that this agency , which controls water - our most limited resource in Colorado and the arid West - is not devoted to the conservation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , we can only hope that those agencies that control our water , like Denver Water , will take the initiative and be the leader when it comes to conservation and alternatives that will sustain us into the future . <p> Denver Water should incorporate even more conservation and efficiency measures into its planning . Some tactics that need to become part of Denver Water 's approach are : rebate programs ; further watering restrictions that are well-timed and planned ; increased educational efforts ; efficiency programs ; leak detection and repair efforts ; making Xeriscaping mandatory for new development while eliminating turfgrass ; and , finally , enabling cooperative water-sharing arrangements that allow farmers and other water-rights holders to temporarily lease their water to cities and others during dry years . <p> KENT VERTREES <p> Steamboat Springs
