Walking along the new California Academy of Sciences building , fronted with palm trees and ferns , I was n't sure where I was going . A group of four approached , accompanied by a black-and-white dog trotting in the lush grass . I thought they might just be heading to the Shakespeare Garden , but then I heard one reading from a sheet of paper : " Bellwether Farms gnocchi ... wild nettles ... sustainable catch of the day . " <p> I knew I was on the trail to the Moss Room . At the end of the building , a woman huddled under a heat lamp on the abandoned patio directed me indoors , through a sea of tomato-red plastic cafeteria chairs . Not what I expected . <p> Then I saw the namesake moss wall leading to my destination , in a building that has already received as much opening publicity as the M.H. de Young Museum did three years ago . The restaurant was featured in food magazines before it opened because of the space and the pairing of two prominent San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Coco500 . <p> Descending the stairs along the moss-covered wall , I wondered how many people would actually make the effort , especially on a dark , damp night , to find this place in Golden Gate Park . But as the marble-topped bar came into view , I realized that the place was fully booked . The faint smell of forest emanating from the fern-studded wall , mixed with the delicate aroma of searing bacon from the kitchen , created a stark contrast with the cool , sleek Olle Lundberg-designed interior . Tiered panels at the ceiling that look as if they belong in a concert hall help reduce noise to the pleasant volume of forest crickets . <p> Despite the out-of-the-way location , on all three nighttime visits , when the Moss Room is open to the public , the 75 seats were filled . On two occasions the 15-seat private room , set behind by clear glass panels , was also booked , adding to the festive but not overwhelming din . The restaurant is open for lunch , but at least for now you can eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the museum . <p> From an architectural standpoint , the sustainable and green nature of the building has created national interest , but in the food world it 's the partnership of longtime friends Phan and Keller that has created the frenzy . While they are equal partners in both the cafeteria and the restaurant , they decided not to combine their culinary styles , so Keller 's Cal-Med cooking is showcased in the Moss Room . <p> Chef Justin Simoneaux brought over some must-order recipes from Coco500 , including the rich pork terrine with house-made pickles and fruit mostarda $11 , and a dessert of vacherin $9 , a blend of Swiss meringue , coffee gelato , chocolate sauce , a flurry of almonds and creme anglaise . <p> The rest of the menu explores the rustic flavors that have made Keller 's food so popular at Bizou and Coco500 . One of the best dishes to illustrate this earthy style is grilled Monterey squid $11 incorporated into a casserole of chickpeas with Swiss chard , oven-dried tomatoes and a gentle jolt of jalapeno pesto . The chef bakes Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cap of toasty breadcrumbs . Cod fritters $9 also have a boisterous flavor , the little balls of crumb-coated creamy salt cod arranged around a bed of frisee with lemon aioli and piquillo peppers . <p> House-made pita bread is a revelation - warm and puffy , cut in triangles and served with hummus , roasted peppers and Manouri cheese ; it 's to pita what supermarket bread is to Acme . <p> Even salads are designed with bold strokes , such as smoked trout $13 combined with hard-cooked quail eggs , fingerling potatoes , frisee and horseradish . In the grilled Fuyu persimmon salad , thick slices of fruit pave the plate $12 , which is piled with chopped purple radicchio , endive , pomegranates and dates . <p> Few chefs have the confidence to use mackerel $23 , a strong-flavored fish listed as a Best Choice on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Program . Simoneaux braises the chunks of sturdy fish in a sweet , bright tomato sauce with mint , olive oil and fine shreds of preserved lemon . It 's rich , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainable catch of the day and an oven-roasted whole fish seasoned with herbs , salt , lemon and olive oil . <p> A brash approach touches every dish : Bacon wraps pork tenderloin paired with mustard and cider $24 ; a roasted guinea fowl $25 rests on a pool of almond curry with a scattering of leafy herbs that mimic the ferns clinging to the moss wall ; ricotta cavatelli $21 is tossed with a red wine duck sugo . Even the spinach side dish $6 gets a lift from a house-made harissa spiked with cumin , golden raisins and pine nuts . <p> Pastry chef Rachel Leising brings it home with desserts all $9 that spark and soothe . I 'm not a fan of mint ice cream $9 , at least I was n't until I tried this version with just a cool hint of mint ; it 's served with two triple chocolate cookies made more intense by what tastes like coffee . The tarte Tatin $9 has half a caramelized apple on top with the juices soaking in and helping to caramelize the crust , accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there 's the vacherin , one of the best desserts on the planet . <p> Because of the location , Keller knows she probably only has one shot to impress people and lure them back , so she 's brought over several recognizable faces from Coco500 . Even though it 's only a couple months old , the staff has a professional air that eludes restaurants that have been around for years . <p> The public can be fickle , and the economy is in a pickle , but Keller has done everything she can to make this restaurant as sustainable as the food that uplifts the menu . <p> of the restaurant , go to . 55 Music Concourse Drive in the California Academy of Sciences , San Francisco ; 415 876-6121 or .
