WHATEVER HE TOLD YOU , it is n't true . <p> First of all , I did like him . Second of all , I did n't mean to leave him in the woods ; I thought he was right behind me . Third of all , I was n't the one who insisted he sleep in the goose house when he got back . And fourth of all , whatever else he 's told you , he 's dumb as two rocks . But surely you could see that for yourself . <p> Did you get all that down ? Okay then . Where was I ? Oh yes - how stupid Hans was . <p> Well really , that 's where all the problems started . <p> I was in the summer of my tenth year when my father sold me to Collum the Miller . They both called it an apprenticeship , but I 've always believed you should tell the truth , however ugly it may be . And the truth is , I was a slave in a little mill in a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another apprentice named Caynard . He was a couple of years older than me , and mean as a horse who 's been stung by a wasp . He was also a lot bigger than me - half a foot taller and a whole lot heavier . It looked bad for me for a while there , but a few months after I arrived , Hans showed up . That saved me . Between my naturally winning nature and Hans 's stupidity , Caynard suddenly took a liking to me . <p> How stupid was Hans ? You know , I hate to speak ill of him . He 's a powerful man these days . <p> Yes , I understand you 'd want a complete record - for future generations , you say ? Well , I suppose I do have a responsibility to history . And it is n't hard to come up with examples . <p> Once , Caynard told Hans that dead bodies do n't bounce . Yes , that 's right . Caynard said , " That 's how healers tell if a patient is dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lift him up , and drop him . If he does n't bounce , the healer leaves - nothing more he can do . " <p> And Hans believed him . Caynard could hardly tell the story with a straight face , but Hans believed him all the same . <p> Another time we were swimming in the millpond . Caynard told Hans that if he could hold his breath , dive underwater , and stay under until he passed out , it would be a sign he 'd be wealthy and successful in life . So Hans did it . Took a big breath , dove down and stayed down . Caynard just sat on the bank and laughed . When Collum came along to see what we were up to , he saw Hans at the bottom of the pond , and he dove down into the water and rescued him . Lucky for Hans . <p> He was quite sick after , but he kept asking Caynard when he 'd get rich . <p> What , me ? Well . I was n't much of a swimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought if he stayed in the water a little longer , it could n't hurt . <p> But I hope you 'll note that I myself never took advantage of Hans 's feeble-mindedness . I merely observed it . <p> Well , then . I 'd been working for Collum for several years when he called the three of us together . It was midsummer 's eve , and the whole village had spent the day drinking and dancing . By midafternoon , Collum was well and happily in his cups , and for once in fine spirit . I remember his cheeks were all red and his eyes were glassy . He had a big smile , and Collum never smiled . He was an unhappy man most of the time . And cheap . But now he pulled out three gold coins and handed one to each of us . Caynard and I just looked at each other . <p> " I know you boys have wanted to go into the city , " he said . " Here 's a little money for each of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back here - oh , let 's say the day after tomorrow . " <p> Caynard and I both knew Collum 's good mood was due entirely to the drink , and since we could n't know how long the drink would maintain his pleasant spirits , we knew we needed to leave before he could change his mind . <p> We 'd wanted to buy ourselves horses for a long while , and we were young enough that we thought those small coins meant we finally could . So we set off for the city . It was a pleasant spring day . The Sun was shining and warm , but not hot . The road to the city goes through the woods , and it 's quite pretty . Still , it was a longer walk than me or Caynard expected . As to Hans - well , we did n't invite him along , but he came just the same . He was always tagging along . <p> Hans said that ? Really . Well , I guess Caynard did say something about how Hans was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be better off staying in the village . As I said , Caynard did n't much like Hans . I had to walk between them , to keep Hans safe from Caynard 's blows . It 's true . <p> But as I was saying , it was a longer walk than we expected . When the Sun went down , we were nowhere near the city . The woods were thick , it was getting dark fast , and we had to find a place to spend the night . <p> I do n't mind telling you , Hans was worse than useless - quivering and shaking and calling for help . Pathetic . And frankly , Caynard was n't a whole lot better . I do n't like to think what would have become of either of them without me . <p> I looked around and spotted a small cave tucked into a low hill a short distance off the road . Telling the other two I 'd find us some shelter , I charged through the woods and up the hill . Caynard and Hans straggled along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reached the cave . I yelled down to the others to come join me . They staggered and slipped , and I had to help drag them up the slope , but they finally made it up to the cave just as full dark was falling . <p> The next morning , Caynard and I awoke shortly after sunup . Caynard panicked - he was afraid of close spaces . " We 've got to get out of here , it 's not safe , it 's dark here , what if there 's something back there .... " You can imagine it for yourself , I 'm sure . <p> " All right , " I said , " just let me wake Hans - " <p> " Forget about Hans ! " Caynard said . " He 's a stupid sluggard ! " <p> There was no arguing with that . But my mother - may she rest in peace - always told me to be kind . " Hans does the best he can , " I told Caynard . <p> Caynard said , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped when he reached the edge . It was n't that much of a drop , but Caynard was afraid of heights . He took several steps backward and collided with me as I followed after him . I was worried about him , you see . <p> " Look , " he said . " Hans is a millstone around our necks . With him along , every horse peddler in the city will try to swindle us . He 's stupid and dirty , and he does n't pull his own weight . I say we leave him here . " <p> " Now , Caynard , " I said , " be fair . " <p> Caynard grabbed my arm , hard . Twisting it , he pulled me toward the drop-off . " I say we leave , and right now . " <p> I confess , I was young and impressionable and scared . And I was also a lot smaller than Caynard - as I believe I told you . He dragged me away from the cave and down the slope . I protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut up . Finally he turned around and grabbed my ear . " If you mention Hans one more time , " he said , " I 'll gut you , here and now . " He drew out his hunting knife menacingly . <p> I was young , and fear won out . I can tell you , I 've regretted that decision ever since . In fact , when we got back to Collum 's , I did organize a search party to try to find Hans . Would you like to hear about that ? It 's sort of an interesting story <p> Okay . No , no , I understand . <p> Well . We went to the city . As you can guess , we did n't find any horses we could afford with what little money we had , but we enjoyed ourselves all the same . <p> When we returned , Collum was peeved that we 'd lost Hans , but he was n't that peeved . After all , Hans was pretty worthless . Mostly , I think Collum was sore that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . Given time , though , he forgot about it . <p> I suppose you know seven years passed before we saw Hans again . It was late spring . I remember it was one of the first really hot days of the year , when being inside the stone-walled mill was actually a relief . On days like that , Collum always sent me and Caynard out to run errands , so he could stay inside and be cool . He 'd just sent us out to bring in some bags of grain . When we got outside , we saw a bedraggled , pathetic-looking boy coming up the road . He was filthy and tattered , and as he got closer I could tell he smelled like rancid meat . Until he greeted us with that silly simpering smile of his , I had no idea who it was . But that smile could have belonged to no one else . <p> Once I got over my shock , I ran forward in delight . All those years I 'd thought something awful had happened to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken captive by some thief in the woods . And here he was <p> But let me tell you , you do n't want to hug a man who has n't bathed in seven years . Well , maybe he had bathed , but I do n't think so . Hans would take any excuse to avoid cleaning himself , you know . He smelled much worse than stale sweat - something like dog turds and cat piss , left out in the hot Sun . I gagged when I got within ten feet of him . <p> And his clothes ! just falling off his body . He 'd grown in the intervening years , of course , so the tatters of his trousers hung around his knees . They were ripped in several unseemly places , but at least there were no women at the mill . he had no shoes , and in fact claimed he had n't worn any in years . His shirt was nothing more than strips of filthy cloth . I ca n't remember what color his clothes had been , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I stopped where I was . I tried to figure out where I could stand that I 'd be upwind of him , but wherever I went , the smell of moldering cheese followed . I was still coughing and choking when Collum came out to see why we had n't brought any of the grain in . <p> " I 'm home ! " Hans chirped , as if nothing had happened . <p> Collum stopped dead . " Hans ? " <p> " Yes , sir , " Hans said . " You 're looking good , sir . " <p> " Where have you been ? " Collum asked him - as if he had just been running late from an errand . <p> Hans gave us all another of his silly smiles . " I was serving a cat . " <p> " What ? " I asked . <p> " I was serving a cat . When I woke up in the cave that morning , you were gone . I got scared and ran out , but I did n't see either of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I could n't find you . And I could n't find the road , either . Finally , I stumbled into a clearing , and there was this little tabby cat , just sitting there , like she 'd been waiting for me . " <p> " Uh-huh , " I said . <p> " The cat seemed to know I was lost . She knew everything about me , actually . She said , ' Hans , I know what you 're seeking and I know you 're lost . I can help . If you agree to serve me for seven years , I 'll give you the finest horse you can imagine . ' " <p> " The cat said this ? " <p> " Yes , she did . She was quite nice about it , actually . So I agreed , and she took me to her castle . There were lots of other cats and kittens there . They all seemed very happy to see me . They kept talking about not having a thumb of their own . " Hans frowned - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you went to a castle full of cats , where you 've been serving them for seven years . " <p> " That 's right . Although - gosh ! - it only feels like a few months to me ! " Again that stupid smile of his . <p> I could n't decide what to think . I was pretty sure he believed his story - though that did n't prove much . But it did make a certain sense . Only an idiot like Hans would agree to serve anyone for seven years in exchange for a stupid horse . And a cat ! Cats are always looking for people to be their slaves . That 's why you need a firm hand to deal with them . Kind of like women that way . And there are always plenty of fools who will rush about bowing and scraping to a pretty girl , when it should be the other way around <p> Oh , all right . I 'll stick to the story . Sorry . <p> Well . I thought about everything he 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bring your horse - " <p> " Within a few days . " <p> " And you believed her ? " <p> He shrugged . " Of course . " <p> I shook my head . " Of course . " <p> I turned away , and half a minute later burst out laughing . I mean , what would you have thought ? <p> The afternoon was getting on , and Hans headed for the house . <p> " Where do you think you 're going ? " Collum asked . " You 're not going in the house . " <p> " But , sir - it 's late , and I 've had a long walk - " <p> " And you smell like the devil himself ! God , boy , when did you last wash ? " He snorted . " If you stay here , you 're sleeping in the goose house tonight . " <p> " The goose house ? But that 's so small . And sir - those geese are mean . " <p> " It 's that , or sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that very moment , there was a loud boom of thunder . An afternoon storm was sweeping in . Hans was afraid of all storms , but thunderstorms in particular . Sort of a shame , really , since the rain would have cleaned him off . But as soon as he heard that thunder , he turned and ran , straight for the goose house , and disappeared inside . The geese made the most awful racket when he went in , but then they calmed down . I do n't understand why he would n't just wash up - clean himself off , put on some new clothes . I think he had the idea the cat wanted him dirty . Made no sense , but Hans rarely did <p> The next morning , me and Collum and Caynard were starting our morning chores when a glittering white coach pulled by six all-white stallions stopped in front of the mill . I could n't see who was riding inside at that point , but there was a footman up front , dressed in pressed formal clothes - black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a long black coat . <p> The footman jumped down and opened the door to the coach , and a woman in a long , flowing white dress stepped out . She was beautiful : raven-black hair and curves in all the right places . I was n't well-traveled , but even I recognized her - the Princess Esmerelda . <p> I admit it : I goggled . <p> " Where is Hans ? " the princess asked us . <p> Caynard started to laugh hysterically , and I had to kick him to shut him up . <p> Collum was the only one who could respond . " Hans is in the goose house , " he said . <p> " Bring him to me , " the princess said . <p> So I ran over to the goose house . Hans came stumbling out , pulling at his tattered clothing to try to cover himself before her . <p> The princess went over to him and clasped his hands in hers . " Hans , my faithful servant , " she said . " I 've brought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the cat ? " Hans asked . <p> What an idiot . I 'd figured that out the minute she appeared . <p> " I was the cat , my dear Hans , " she said . " Now , I am your princess . " <p> She motioned to the footman , who brought forth a seventh horse , another stallion , tied to the back of the coach . It must have stood seventeen hands high , and it was so white , it seemed to glow in the sunlight . Hans , of course , just got that same silly grin on his face . <p> Collum trotted over to the horse and started stroking its neck , his eyes alight with greed . " Well , Hans , my boy , " he said . " You 've certainly done well for yourself . As I always knew you would , of course . " He looked at the princess . " Brightest boy I ever had here . I knew from the day I set eyes on him , he 'd be the one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Hey , " Caynard said , who 'd been promised the mill years earlier . " That 's not fair - " <p> I kicked him again to shut him up . <p> " Hans no longer needs your mill , " Esmerelda replied coolly . She turned to Hans . " For seven years , " she said , " you served me without question . You chopped wood for me in the winter and fanned my face in the summer . You were never cross or demanding . Not once did you show the slightest sign of avarice . You saw your service as its own reward . You have proven yourself the perfect husband . " <p> With that , the footman dragged Hans off to the millpond , threw him in , and started cleaning him up . You know the rest of the story - he married the princess , became king in time , had lots of lovely children , and so on and so forth . <p> Caynard and I , of course , did n't fare so well . Caynard got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that surprising . And I 'm still here , waiting for Collum to die , waiting to take over this miserable little mill . <p> The one thing I want you to get down for your history is this : I was a good friend to Hans . I always treated him decently . Once he left with the princess , though , I never heard from him again . Nothing . Not a word . <p> But if it had n't been for me , he never would have been in the forest that day , and he never would have found the cat there , and he never would have married Princess Esmerelda , and he never would have become king . I made Hans who he is today . <p> I 'd say he owes me one . <p> Would n't you ? <p> IMG
