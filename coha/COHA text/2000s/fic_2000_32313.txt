Someone was following her in a car . Vicki clutched her books to her chest and walked toward town . She did n't look back . She could n't risk letting them know she suspected . Mrs. Jenness had let her go . That was a surprise . But Vicki would have stayed all night without ratting on her friends . But would her friends be as faithful to her ? Seeing Shelly and her mother in the principal 's office had sickened Vicki . Shelly had been sincere about her faith , had n't she ? Could it have been an act ? The sight of Judd , John , and Mark turning away from her down the hall made her heart sink . Did n't they care ? Or were they trying to protect her by keeping their distance ? Vicki had a good idea who was following her : someone from school assigned to see where she went . Perhaps Judd and the others had figured that out . They would n't have simply abandoned her . Vicki had to get back to her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jenness discovered she had no parents , all the kids would be at risk . She needed to keep moving and stay away from Judd 's house . Vicki looked in shop windows and followed the reflection of the trailing car . When it stopped , she ducked into a drugstore . She sat at a bench in the back and tapped out a message on the tiny digital system on her wrist that looked like a watch . She asked Judd to meet her at a nearby park . She would try to shake whoever was following her and meet him there . The front door opened . A man 's voice . Loud . " Did a girl with red hair come in here ? " Vicki crouched beneath the prescription window . " Right there , " the cashier said . Vicki looked up . The overhead mirror ran the length of the wall and angled down . The man behind the counter pointed toward her . Vicki remembered how her little sister , Jeanni , used to play hide-and-seek by sticking her head in the closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duh , " Vicki said as she leapt to her feet . " Stop ! " the cashier shouted . Vicki pushed open a door that said EMPLOYEES ONLY . " Hey , you ca n't go in there ! " the pharmacist barked . " We 'll get her , " someone shouted . Vicki locked the door behind her . Footsteps and shouts outside . Darkness inside . Vicki fumbled for a light switch . Keys were jangling , getting closer . " What did she take ? " someone said . Vicki moved toward a thin strip of light on the other side of the room . The back door ! She tripped over a chair and banged her head . The doorknob jiggled behind her . She leaned against the back door , and it swung open to blistering light . A siren rang just above her head . She staggered out . As the door swept shut she read , " Emergency Exit OnlyAlarm Will Sound . " She ran . Judd had waited in his car after school , hoping Vicki would walk that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel and Ryan 's school when his wrist messenger vibrated and he saw Vicki 's message . He quickly sent another to Lionel and Ryan : " Get home and keep watch . I 'll be there as fast as I can . " The park had been a late-night teen hangout . With the rise in crime , a lot of kids were afraid to go there . Judd sat in the parking lot looking at the empty swing sets . Before the disappearances , the place would have been full of little kids . Now there were no families at picnic tables or moms and dads with strollers . It was a ghost town . " Get the car , " the loud man said . " I 'll meet you at the end of the alley . " Vicki heard shuffling and then silence . She did n't want to rise up from her hiding place , but the smell was overpowering . She peeked from under the lid of the huge garbage bin . No one . Something furry moved behind her . She bolted . Vicki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main street when a car passed . A second later it was back . " There she is ! " a man said , but she did n't see his face . She was running the other way . The alley fence was way over her headno time to climb . Every door she tried was locked . The car pulled behind her and gunned the engine . Judd had been so focused on getting to the park and alerting Ryan and Lionel that he forgot to let Vicki know he was waiting . He backtracked , slowing to look in shop windows and down alleys . He heard the screech of tires and swerved to miss an oncoming car barreling around a corner . He drove past the drugstore and hung a left . Judd sped past an alley and slammed on his brakes . Vicki ran toward him , the car bearing down on her . Judd made a U-turn and opened the passenger door . Vicki jumped in . " Go , go , go ! " she shouted . " I do n't mean to be rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look awful . " " Thanks , " Vicki said , panting . " Just get me out of here ! " Judd sped through a yellow light . The car behind had a red , but it ran through the light , swerved to miss oncoming traffic , and kept gaining . " Who is that ? " Judd said . " It 's got ta be Handlesman or somebody he told to follow me . They want us bad . " Judd turned at the next light , then into an alley . They careened around another corner and through an empty parking lot . " Hang on , " Judd said as he crossed a patch of grass and turned into a tree-lined subdivision . He flew across a bridge , spun in the entrance to a park , and came to a halt behind some shrubs . The trailing car was nowhere in sight . " Better stay here awhile just to make sure , " Judd said . " Who gave you the shiner ? " " A filing cabinet , I think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her interrogation at school . Judd told her they had listened to Shelly and her mother through the bug in Mrs. Jenness 's office . " What did Shelly say ? " Vicki asked . " How much were you able to hear ? " " We heard Shelly crying and her mother yelling at her to give you up , " he said . " Not much more . " " Then maybe they pushed her into it , " Vicki said . " At least that 's what I hope . " Judd sniffed . " Is it me , or is there an odor in here ? " Vicki blushed . " I hid in a garbage bin . " Judd pulled a blackened piece of banana peel from her hair . " Pretty resourceful . " " And gross , " Vicki said , shuddering and rubbing her arms . " I hate goose bumps . " " Are you cold ? " She shook her head . " Judd , they told me to bring my parents tomorrow . " " They do n't know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're not letting on . " Judd paused . " Uh , I want to thank you . We could n't hear the interrogation , but we could tell you handled yourself well . We were all impressed . " " You would have done the same for me . " " Mark wanted to rescue you . Said we should give ourselves up . " " He did n't think I could handle the pressure ? " " He did n't think it was fair to put you through it . " " I could 've choked Handlesman , " Vicki said . " He treated me like some dumb little girl , like I 'd never have the brains to put two sentences together , let alone a newspaper . " " Do n't worry , " Judd said . " You 'll get your chance to show him Monday morning . " " You 're not going through with it again , are you ? " Judd nodded . " Why not ? If Bruce is right , the treaty between Israel and Carpathia will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . We have to tell people what 's ahead . " " Bruce says the treaty signals the beginning of the Tribulation , right ? " " Exactly , " Judd said . " But how are you gon na get the Underground inside ? You 've got the guard checkpoint , cameras , and every teacher in the school on the lookout . " Judd shrugged . " We 've got God on our side . " Vicki ran through all her options , and none seemed very good . Judd waited until dusk to start the car . " Can we stop and see Bruce on the way home ? " Vicki said . " I want to see what he thinks . " " He could pretend to be your father , " Judd said . " That 'd be lying , " Vicki said . " He 'd never do that . " A few cars lined the New Hope Village Church parking lot . Maybe the Tribulation Force is meeting , Judd thought . He parked in front and kept the engine running . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news station on the radio . " Not a day has passed without some major development with new UN Secretary-General Nicolae Carpathia , " the reporter said . " And today was no exception . Cincinnati Archbishop Peter Cardinal Mathews , who some see as successor to the vanished pope , announced a new cooperative religion that would incorporate the tenets of all major religions . He calls it the Global Community Faith . " " Our religions have caused much division and bloodshed , " Cardinal Mathews droned . " From this day forward we will unite under the banner of the Global Community Faith . Our logo will contain sacred symbols from religions that represent all , and from here on will encompass all . Whether we believe God is a real person or merely a concept , God is in all and above all and around all . God is in us . God is us . We are God . " Judd shook his head . What a pack of lies . " We will elect a pope , " Mathews said . " And we expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their usual cycles . But these leaders will serve the Global Community Faith and be expected to maintain the loyalty and devotion of their parishioners to the larger cause . " The reporter continued . " United Nations Secretary-General Nicolae Carpathia said the move toward one religion is a welcome change . " " We clearly are at the most momentous juncture in world history , ' " Carpathia said . " With the consolidation to one form of currency , with the cooperation and toleration of many religions into one , with worldwide disarmament and commitment to peace , the world is truly becoming one . ' " " Another incredible development came when Nicolae Carpathia answered questions regarding the rebuilding of the Jewish temple and the future of the Islamic Dome of " Vicki jumped in the car and slapped the radio off . " Go ! " she shouted . " What 's going on ? " " Look , " Vicki pointed . Running toward them was an angry Coach Handlesman . Judd sped away . " What 's he doing here ? " Judd said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knocked . All of a sudden Coach Handlesman starts yelling ! He accuses Bruce of crimes , says he 'll have him thrown in jail . I was outta there . " " How could Coach Handlesman know about Bruce ? " Vicki shook her head . " Maybe Shelly gave them his name . Bruce went with me to her house . " " Great , " Judd said . " I did n't want to drag Bruce into the middle of all this . " Judd parked near his house and watched for Coach Handlesman . When he was sure they had eluded him , Judd pulled inside the garage and lowered the door . Lionel and Ryan peppered them with questions until late . " No lights tonight , " Judd told them . And the four would take turns watching the street .
