I was going to begin my autobiography this way : // Call me . . . Captain James T. Kirk or Sergeant // T.J. Hooker or Denny Crane Denny Crane or Twilight Zone plane passenger Bob Wilson or the Big Giant Head or Henry V or the Priceline Negotiator or . . . // Well , that 's the problem , is n't it ? I 've been a working actor for more than half a century and I 've played so many different roles on the stage , on television , and in the movies that it would be impossible to focus on just one of them . Besides , my career as an actor is only part of my story , so I realized I could n't begin this book that way . // Then I decided I was going to start this book by telling the story of my memorable meeting with Koko the gorilla : // In 1988 , to help the Gorilla Foundation encourage Californians to contribute to its Endangered Species Campaign , I was permitted to visit Koko the gorilla in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to communicate with human beings . She was able to sign more than six hundred words , but more impressively , as her handlers told me , she understood the meaning of those words . She knew the signs for water and for bird and the first time she saw a duck landing on a lake she signed water bird . That displayed a synthesis of knowledge . So you see , she was obviously very intelligent . I was allowed to go into her compound , to enter a room with her all alone . As I walked into that room I was reminded that she was an imposing , powerful animal ; smaller gorillas have been known to tear off men 's arms in anger . I am not often afraid , but truthfully I was frightened . // There is a form of acting that teaches : feel it and say it , and that feeling will be revealed through your words . The English form is quite different : say it and then you feel it . To deal with my fear of this magnificent animal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " I love you , Koko . I love you . " I said it earnestly and honestly and I looked directly in her eyes as I spoke . I crouched over a little to show submission , moving forward rather than backward to show I was not afraid . Over and over I repeated , " I love you , Koko , I love you . " And as I said it , I began to feel that love . Finally I stopped directly in front of her and looked into her deep brown eyes and saw her furrowed brow and her enormous hands . I love you , Koko. // And with that she reached out and grabbed me by my balls . And looked me right in the eyes . After a slight pause-in a substantially higher voice-I tried to repeat , " I love you , Koko . " Obviously these words had more significance than a few seconds earlier . // Her handler , standing just outside the room , said , " Stand very still . She wants you to go to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to go to her bedroom . I think it is fair to say that few people in history have ever stood as still as I did at that moment . Meanwhile , in the adjoining compound a young gorilla who they hoped would mate with Koko was pounding on the door like a jealous husband . There I was , caught in the eternal triangle , with a gorilla holding on to my rapidly shrinking scrotum . Eventually she got bored ... // Starting this book with that story would enable me to inform the reader that it 's not going to be limited to my professional career , that it will also include stories about all the extraordinary opportunities I 've been given to explore the world . I 'd discuss all the amazing experiences I 've had , from that dark night in Africa when I pursued a wild elephant to the afternoon a helicopter left me more alone than I 'd ever been in my life on top of a **25;297;TOOLONG glacier , and even to that memorable moment when I saw aliens in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a lot of laughs in this book , most of them at my expense . But then I realized that people know me primarily from the work I 've done as an actor , so that would n't be effective as a beginning . So I decided not to begin that way either . // Then I had a great idea . I was going to start the book by quoting the lyrics to a song I 'd written about the truly tragic death by drowning of my beautiful wife , Nerine Shatner : // My love was supposed to protect her It did n't My love was supposed to heal her It did n't You had said do n't leave me And I begged you not to leave me We did // Opening the book that way would be so meaningful to me , beginning with the great tragedy of my life . And it would immediately let readers know that this is to be a truthful book . But it would also be such a sad beginning , when my life has been filled with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known for my singing ; in fact there are those who believe my performance of " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds " may be the worst version of a Beatles song ever recorded . Not me- of course . And this is such a personal story that it needs to be told in its entirety , so certainly I could n't begin my book that way . // There is one extremely well-known phrase that I definitely decided I would not use to begin this book : // " Beam me up , Scotty. " // In fact , I am determined that this phrase will not appear anywhere in this book . // The beginning , I knew , needed to catch the interest of the reader within a few words , to engage their curiosity , to make them wonder , perhaps , what the hell is he talking about ? Which led to : // I arrived in New York City for the first time in my life in an Indian outrigger canoe , having paddled all the way from Montreal ... // I liked that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . Somehow it seemed too gimmicky , too clever , so I knew I could n't use that . Maybe later in the first chapter , I decided . // It occurred to me that perhaps I should open this book with a description of the day I took my beautiful horse , Sultan 's Great Day , for his final walk in the pasture . Oh my , you should have seen him in his world-championship days . I 'm telling you , this was the most magnificent stallion you 've ever seen . I 'm not kidding about that . Really , people were in awe of his presence . They would look at him and ... // I would use that beginning to tell you about my passions , the passions that have made all the difference in my life . The passions that I 've spent my life pursuing : the love of a beautiful woman , the love for my family , the love for my craft , my art , the need to experience every aspect of life . Sometimes I 'm amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my priorities as a young man , the desire to act , the need to be loved , the pleasures of a great meal , a great laugh , and enduring companionship . // But simply telling you about my passions-even my passion for horses and dogs-seemed far too somber an opening . // Perhaps , I thought , I should start this book by being glib , by exposing my quirky sense of humor to the readers . Make them laugh at the very beginning by quoting a newspaper story about one of the more unusual things I 've ever done : // ( AP ) 1/17/2006 Actor William Shatner agreed on Monday to sell his kidney stone for $75,000 to an online casino . The money will go to Habitat for Humanity . " This takes organ donors to a new height , or perhaps a new low , " said Shatner . The auction price includes the surgical stent and string used to permit passage of the stone . // According to Shatner , the kidney stone was so big , " You 'd want to wear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , it might turn out to be a diamond ... " // While that beginning certainly would be humorous , it just seemed too frivolous to start that way . Instead , it occurred to me that the opening of this book should be thoughtful , it should be about my life . How much more sincere could I be about the life I 've had than using words written by David E. Kelley for the character I play on Boston Legal , Denny Crane Denny Crane : // Evening : Crane and Shore on the balcony outside Crane 's office // CRANE // Alan Shore believes man has a soul . Stop the presses . // SHORE // Do n't you believe it ? Can this be all there is ? And if so ... // have we not wasted ... // CRANE // I have n't wasted a second . I 've enjoyed my ride , all of it . // SHORE // But will it have truly counted for something ? // CRANE // You 've heard the old joke , Alan . Man shows up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , briefcase , cigar , prancing about , he says to St. Peter , " Who the hell is that ? " St. Peter says , " Oh that 's just God . Thinks he 's Denny Crane . " // SHORE // What would you do , Denny , if you actually met God one day ? // CRANE // I du n no . Probably take him fishing . // For a brief time I had decided this was the perfect way to open this book . Then it occurred to me , let Denny Crane write his own book ! Finally , inspiration struck ! I had what I believed would be a unique and perfect opening : // Are you tired of paying full price for this book ? Well , you do n't have to . You can buy as many copies of it as you like-and you name the price ! That 's right , you name the price you want to pay . At Priceline.com it 's as simple as that . Here 's the way ... // Opening this book like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me from my work representing various companies , such as Priceline.com . And if we also could sell a few more copies of this book , well , I did n't think St. Martin 's would object . And if Priceline was approached properly by my agent , perhaps they might even be willing to purchase the rights to the opening paragraph . For less than full price , of course . // But perhaps that was too crass for the opening of my autobiography , I decided . Is that really what I wanted to emphasize about my life and my career ? And would Priceline meet my price ? So that opening too , was rejected . // And then it occurred to me : I do n't need an opening . By the time you 've reached this paragraph my autobiography has already started . Of course that was very similar to my career ; I was already in the middle of it before I realized it had begun . // The first time I stood on a stage I made the audience cry . // Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell all the jokes unless I specifically identify a straight line . In which case you will have the opportunity make up the jokes . // I was six years old , attending Rabin 's Camp , a summer camp for Jewish welfare cases run by my aunt in the mountains north of Montreal . I wanted to box at that camp-hitting people seemed like fun-but my aunt instead put me in a play named Winterset . My role was that of a young boy forced to leave his home because the Nazis were coming . In the climactic scene I had to say good-bye to my dog , knowing I probably would never see him again . My dog was played by another camper , costumed in painted newspaper . We performed the play on parents ' weekend to an audience consisting primarily of people who had escaped the Nazis , many of whom still had family members trapped in Hitler 's Europe . So many of them had left everything they knew or owned behind-and there I was , saying good-bye to my little doggie. // I cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bow and seeing people wiping away their tears . I remember the warmth of my father holding me as people told him what a wonderful son he had . Just imagine the impact that had on a six-year-old child . I had the ability to move people to tears . And I could get approval . // Something in me always wanted to perform , always wanted the attention that came from pleasing an audience . Years before my camp debut my older sister remembers my mother taking the two of us downtown . Apparently I ran away and it took them several hectic minutes to find me-dancing happily in front of an organ-grinder. // Where did that come from ? That need to please people ? What part of me was born with the courage to stand in front of strangers and risk rejection ? There was nothing at all like that in my family history . The Shatner family was Polish and Austrian and Hungarian , and apparently several of my forebears were rabbis and teachers . // Like so many Jewish immigrants my father was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores . Admiration Clothes . They were basically suits for workingmen who owned only one suit . Joseph Shatner was a stern but loving man , a hard-working man . I can close my eyes and remember the smell of his cutting room . The unforgettable aroma of raw serge and tweed in rolled-up bales , mixed with the smell of my father 's cigarettes . Saturday afternoon was the only time he would relax , lying on the couch and listening to New York 's Metropolitan Opera on the radio . He came to Montreal from Eastern Europe when he was fourteen , and worked selling newspapers and in other labor-intensive jobs . He started in the clothing business packing boxes and eventually became a salesman and finally started his own small company . He was the first member of his family to come to North America , but eventually he helped all ten of his brothers and sisters leave Europe . My friend Leonard Nimoy likes to joke about the fact that I never stop working ; he does an imitation of me in which he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-ten ? If I 'm done there by four-thirty can we get something for four-fifty ? " // Perhaps there is some truth to that . Every actor has spent days ... months staring at the telephone , willing it to ring . And living with the hollow fear that it might never ring again . Painting the walls over again while waiting for the next offer . After beginning my career I went more than twenty years without taking a real vacation , petrified I might miss a phone call . Having had that experience , having lived in the back of pickup trucks in the parking lots of summer theaters , indeed I am open to opportunities . But there is a general belief that I will accept almost anything that I 'm offered and that certainly is not true . It was less than two years ago that I turned down an offer . Like any actor , I 'm concerned about being overexposed , so I 've been very careful to limit myself to acting on the stage and in dramatic television programs , hosting documentary-type programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsing products , doing voice-overs , charity appearances , radio programs , Webcasts , videos , Star Trek conventions , game shows , horse shows and dog shows , writing books and songs , making albums , creating , directing and producing television programs , performing at concerts , and appearing on talk shows , competitive reality-type shows , and award programs . But that 's where I draw the line . For example , I rarely do bar mitzvahs and I 've never worked in the Catskills. // My work ethic comes from my father . His dream was that I would eventually take over the business . So , as he had done , I worked in the factory packing suits . One of my skills is good packing . I know how to fold a suit with the shoulders touching inside-out , the sleeves down , folded flat so it stays pressed . I know the correct way to fold pants and put them in a box . Had I not become an actor I could have had a fine career in folding . // But acting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was n't a thing real people did , it was n't a job . It was n't what people did to earn a living . It was playing . // From my father I learned the value of education , respect for others around me , and to be on time and prepared to work . Eleven-oh-five , he used to tell me , was not eleven o'clock . All my life I have been on time and prepared to work . I 'll tell you how deeply that ethic is ingrained in me . In 2007 I was invited by ABC to participate in a show entitled Fast Cars and Superstars , actually a NASCAR celebrity race . This was an opportunity to drive as fast as possible in an oval without having to worry about speed traps . A racetrack is the one place in the world you can drive as fast as your skills and your courage allow . This was my kind of TV show . I said , " Of course , I 'd love to do it . " And then I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // As I was leaving the set of Boston Legal to fly to Charlotte , North Carolina , a producer gently put a comforting hand on my shoulder and explained , " Remember Bill , you 've got to report for work Thursday at seven a.m . And if you 're not here , if you 've hit a wall and broken your arms and legs or turned the car over and are lying in a hospital somewhere covered from head to toe in bandages so you ca n't get back , this company can sue you . " Then he paused and smiled broadly . " Other than that , have a great time . " // I 've loved fast cars all my life . I 've long admired the great drivers . But I am aware of the danger . I know Dale Earnhardt Jr . ' s fate . The reality is that race drivers die . They crash and burn , they roll over and catch fire . I 've seen those pictures . Not me , of course , them . I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star never gets hurt . // There were twelve competitors divided into four groups . Each group of three people shared one car . For safety , there would be one driver on the track at a time . We were racing against time , not directly against each other . My group consisted of myself , former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher , and volleyball player-model Gabrielle Reece . We drove for the first time in a morning practice round . I hit 160 mph , and as I went around the turns I was convinced the car was going to slide out from under me and hit the wall . Well , it did n't , and 160 mph put me way back in the pack . // I promised myself I would do better in the actual competition . I realized I had been holding back on the straightaways , anticipating the next turn . When we raced that night I intended to press down on the accelerator so I could remain in the race . The only question I had was who would be eliminated first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was scheduled to race Tuesday night . Cowher went first . He spun out and hit the wall ; the $500,000 car was badly damaged . We waited more than an hour for a replacement car ; finally Cowher made his run and established his time . Gabrielle Reece had posted some very fast times in her practice runs , but during her run she also spun out and almost hit the wall . Now it was my turn . // I was wearing a completely fireproof jumpsuit and a large bulbous helmet with a face mask that covered my entire head . When they tried to strap me in I realized something was wrong . This car had been set up for Cowher and Reece , two very tall people . My feet did n't reach the pedals . And the seat would n't move . The only thing that did move was the telescoping steering wheel . But the wheel in the car was too large , so they replaced it with a much smaller wheel that was sticking into my gut , much smaller than any steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one o'clock in the morning , I was tired , and the lithium lights shining down on the filthy windshield made it difficult to see clearly . // In minutes I was going to be driving faster than 160 mph with a steering wheel jammed into my belly and pillows stuffed behind me to push me forward so I could reach the pedals on a track I could not see clearly . // This was crazy and I knew it . I thought , what am I doing here ? I could be killed . // I put my foot down on the accelerator and took off . I 've learned in karate that your chi is below your belly button and as you do any physical activity you release it in explosive breaths . I 've done that many times . My intention was to blow out my chi by yelling as I went around those turns . // Actually , I believe that my exact words as I raced around the corners were " Whooooooooooooooooooooo . Whooooooooooooooooooooo . " I was not blowing out my chi , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew I was going to die . I could barely control the car , I could n't see where I was going , and I was driving faster than 160 mph . I never should have been in that situation . Drivers have told me about the feeling of Zen they 've experienced in which they are one with the car . I did n't get that feeling , instead I felt like a foreign body that the car was trying to eject . // I finished my three official laps . I never learned my time ; I was disqualified for a technical violation . But later I wondered why I had taken that risk . I risked my life for a television program ? I did it , I realized , because the cameras were rolling . Believe me , if those TV cameras had not been there I would n't have risked my life . But the cameras were there ; this was a show , a performance . This was my job . And as I had been taught by my father , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // It was my mother , Ann Shatner , who encouraged me to act . She sent me to acting school ; she never missed a performance . She went with me to audition for radio roles and when I did n't get the part she would call the producer , Mr. Rupert Kaplan , to scream at him for not hiring me . Unlike some mothers she did n't follow me to college when I attended McGill-she did n't have to , we lived two miles from the campus . // My mother might accurately be described kindly as ditzy . Her own family had been relatively well off and she was somewhat spoiled ; the contrast between this lovely young woman who had so much and a hard-working man struggling to bring his family over from Europe must have been extreme . My mother had a great dramatic flair . She wanted her life to be big and loud . When we went for dinner , for example , she would quite often inform the waiter that it was her birthday . I still get embarrassed thinking about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us were cringing as the waiters gathered around our table to loudly sing " Happy Birthday . " I 'm certain people would look at our table and wonder why this entire family was looking down and not singing " Happy Birthday " to that lovely woman . What a reputation we must have had : that Shatner family wo n't sing " Happy Birthday , " imagine that . My mother had more birthdays than anyone in the world . // She always took great pleasure in my success , and even more pleasure in sharing it . I can still hear her saying those memorable words , " I 'm William Shatner 's mother . " I can still hear it because she never stopped saying it . Everywhere she went . If she got on an elevator before the doors closed she would say , " Hello everybody , I 'm William Shatner 's mother . " In department stores , in every restaurant , " I 'm William Shatner 's mother . " On occasion I 'd get on an airplane and the stewardess would tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't need to ask how she knew it was my mother . I would tell my mother over and over , please do n't do that . It 's embarrassing . I hate it . Do n't do it . And she would look at me sadly and say , " Okay , I wo n't do it . " And then she would turn around , " Hi , I 'm William Shatner 's mother . " // My father used to remind me with tremendous emphasis , " She 's still . your mother " Meaning no matter what she 's done , how much you do n't understand her , you will treat her with respect . She 's still your mother . // She was an elocution teacher . She was not , as she often corrected my father , an execution teacher , she was an elocution teacher . I want you to do something for me please , try to pronounce these words aloud as you read them : ten tin men , ten tin men . The difference between " ten " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frustrated actress ; there really was no place for a middle-aged Jewish mother of three to perform in Montreal , so she would act out monologues at home . When I was seven or eight years old she enrolled me in the Dorothy Davis School for Actors , which was run by Miss Dorothy Davis and Miss Violet Walters in the basement of someone 's home . It was in that basement that I learned the skills necessary to succeed in the difficult thespian world-specifically , get up on stage , say my words , get off the stage-skills that eventually allowed me to play such memorable roles as Prince Charming and Tom Sawyer at a theater in the local park . I am proud to say I am the most famous graduate of the Dorothy Davis School for Actors . // I do n't remember being taught how to act , we just acted . And the school charged admission to watch us act . Actually , I do n't believe acting can be taught , but what you can learn is the discipline of learning your words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I was a lonely kid . I 'd walk to school by myself . In school , on Valentine 's Day , I would send myself valentines . Those would be the only ones I would receive . One year I got six valentines from myself ! Truthfully , I do n't know why I did n't have many close friends . It might have had something to do with the neighborhood in which we lived . While all my relatives lived in the Jewish section of Montreal , my family lived in a comfortable house on Girouard Street , in the more affluent , mostly Catholic area NDG , Notre Dame de Grace . // There was always trouble between the Jewish kids and the Catholic kids , there was a lot of anti-Semitism . When I had to go to Hebrew school I 'd walk on the opposite side of the street , actively pretending I did n't even realize the synagogue was there-until I got in front of it . Then I 'd look both ways and run for the door . I actually planned my strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , I was n't a big kid but I never backed down from anybody . We had fights almost every day . My nickname was " Toughie , " as in , Hey , watch out everybody , here comes Toughie Shatner ! Actually , you might not want to mention that to little Lenny Nimoy , another Jewish kid growing up at exactly the same time in Boston . I 'd hear stories about Jewish soldiers who had come back from the war ; one or two men taking on a whole gang of anti-Semites and beating them into submission with an ax handle . // I played football and skied in high school and I loved both sports , but it was acting that made me feel complete . Acting made me special , and I was good at it . I never had difficulty pretending to be someone else . At camp , not only did I make the adults cry , I literally drove a camper crazy . I was working as a counselor with my friend Hilliard Jason-he required me to call him Hilliard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holocaust , kids who had seen their parents slaughtered , kids who just as easily could kill you with a pencil as become friends . I was able to control them because I was the camp storyteller . At night , in the dark , I would read Poe and Kafka with great elocution . One night I read " The Tell-tale Heart " - " You fancy me mad . Madmen know nothing . But you should have seen me " - and one child broke down in fear . He let free all of those emotions kept inside for so long and it was too much for him . He became hysterical . The next day he was sent home , wrapped in blankets in the backseat of a car . // What had I done ? I felt terrible . Awful . That had not been my intention . But I was also astonished . Once again I had seen the extraordinary power of words to evoke great emotion . Look what I could do ! Just by saying some words ! // I acted throughout my childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put on our plays at the Victorian Theatre in the park and on local radio . For five years I saved damsels on Saturday Morning Fairy Tales , even if I was n't quite certain what a damsel was . What eight-year-old does n't want to be Prince Charming ? Or Ali Baba ? Or Huck Finn ? I got to be them all . Acting was playing . I was being me being someone else . It came easily to me . I crashed my sister Joy 's sweet sixteen party , for example , costumed as an old man . Joy had no idea it was me , no idea . She came over to me and said , politely , " Excuse me , but I do n't think I know who you are . " When she got close enough and looked into my eyes , she knew . But the concept that I could do this as a profession , that I could earn ... // Oh , excuse me . I just have to go star in another movie with Sandra Bullock for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song I wrote with Ben Folds and I 'll be back in a few sentences : // I know what she 's gon na do ; And I ca n't wait for her to do it .

I know her scent , I know her touch ; where to hold her and just how much . // My lady belongs here and so ... // Okay , I 'm back . Where was I ? Growing up , the concept that I could continue to do this playing as an adult was not something that occurred to me . It was just something that I loved doing . In high school I played football and acted in school plays and for the first time I allowed myself to dream . Under my photograph in my senior yearbook I finally admitted it out loud : I wanted to be an actor . Not that out loud of course , not loud enough for my father to hear me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real job in the theater-as a stage manager . I was fifteen years old and I had absolutely no experience .

I was in the theater ; backstage , but inside the theater . The actor was tall and good-looking and early in the run he asked me if I wanted to join him for dinner . // Well , I thought , I must be a great stage manager . The star of the show has asked me to have dinner with him . Naturally I accepted his invitation . As we left the theater that night he asked me if I had a jacket with me .

It was not something spoken about in middle-class Jewish homes . // What happened that night changed my attitude toward women for the rest of my life . I understood the anger and frustration that a woman feels when she says no , and means no , and the man believes she is saying yes . // Acting had become my passion . I was hungry to stand before an audience and perform . I accepted every opportunity offered to me .

" When the audience responded I could feel the power of my performance . Me , little Billy Shatner from the west end of Montreal , not quite Westmont , holding this audience in my hand . Strike ! Strike ! It was magnificent , beautiful . Strike ! Strike ! // I had absolutely no idea what I was doing . No understanding of political philosophy . I was acting , that 's all . Giving life and emotion to words written on paper . The red-baiting movement started several years later , just as I was beginning my career in America . I was terrified that someone would ask me about my work for the Communist party . // At West Hill High School I was never a very good student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of ability .

I barely graduated from high school and yet was accepted to the McGill University School of Commerce . The business school . I was admitted under a Jewish quota that existed at that time . With my grades they must have been marking on a very large curve . My family believed I was at McGill to learn how to bring modern economic practices into my father 's clothing business , so I could turn it into the hugely successful corporation we all knew was just the completion of my college education away . But I knew I was there to perform in their shows . // I spent considerably more time in the drama department than going to class .

My father 's dream was that we would work together one day . As a teenager I would go with him on sales calls . We 'd put on our best suits and drive to these small French villages outside Montreal . He had friends in every village-this is my old friend Jake , my old friend Pierre , my old friend Robert-people he had sold to for years . To each of these men he would proudly introduce me , " This is my son , " and they would comment on how tall I was , how much I looked like him . It was the salesman 's dance . I was being brought into the family business . // I did n't know how I could tell him . One afternoon , during my third year in college , for some reason we were in my bedroom and he asked me casually if I 'd thought about my future . Just as casually I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart just plummeted . // He sat down on my bed as the enormity of that hit him . He did n't understand the theater . Acting was n't a job for a man . Actors were bums . For him , it was like being a minstrel . The chances of succeeding , of having any kind of meaningful life were very , very slim . I knew he was devastated , but the only thing he said to me was , " Well , you do what you want to do . There 's always a place for you here . I do n't have the money to support you , but I 'll help you the best I can . " The only thing he asked of me was that I not become a " hanger-on . " By that he meant being dependent on other people , on unemployment insurance , a man who could n't earn his own keep . // How brave he was to put aside his dreams so I might pursue my own . And how it must have hurt him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paycheck ; the life of an artist was inconceivable to him . But rather than trying to talk me out of it , or offering advice , he gave me freedom . // And he always kept that place for me . Just in case . // I graduated from McGill University with my degree in commerce and I immediately put that degree to work . Mrs. Ruth Springford , a woman who had directed me in several college plays , was the director of a summer theater , the Mountain Playhouse . Having seen my work , she hired me as the assistant manager . The company was performing mostly one-set Broadway shows like Roman Candle and The Seven Year Itch . In those days playwrights were writing shows with minimal scenery and sets , knowing that if their play was successful on Broadway the number of companies that produced it in local theaters-and paid those royalties-would depend greatly on how many sets it had . Generally those plays were light comedies featuring a young guy-often a shy or bumbling young guy-with an innocent smile big enough to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager . A disgrace to my commerce degree . I kept losing tickets and mixing up reservations , which were basically the only responsibilities I had . Actors were easily replaceable , but the survival of the theater depended on getting the ticket sales right . Most actors get hired ; to save the theater I was fired into the cast . I began playing all those happy young man roles . // These were Broadway shows coming to Canada ; the audience was ready to laugh . My talent was knowing my lines and waiting until the laughter stopped before speaking . I had no formal acting training , I never did . I would read about actors in New York City studying The Method . Well , I had my own method , I said my lines as if I were the character . I learned how to act from acting . The audience taught me how to act . If I did something and the audience responded , I did it again . So this experience of working every night , learning new roles , studying lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . // A few years later , when I was a member of the company at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival , they held classes in technique and voice production and even swordplay for the young actors . The problem was that we were working much too hard as actors to find the time to take classes to learn how to act . By the time I had learned technique we had already opened our second show of the season and were in the middle of rehearsals for the third show . But at Stratford I did work with classically trained actors , among them James Mason and Anthony Quayle . We worked with experienced actors every day , we rehearsed with them , we played small roles , we understudied , and when we were n't onstage we watched them . I learned to act by watching other actors , reading about acting , and living with actors . I studied my craft , but I learned acting by acting . // I was a serious actor , I knew I must be a serious actor because I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well for much later in my career when I would be a well-known television actor and was n't making any money from it . I still dreamed of one day earning one hundred dollars a week , but that seemed far away . At least once a day , sometimes more , I spent twenty-seven cents for a plate of fruit salad at Kresge 's lunch counter . I lived on fruit salad and grew to hate fruit salad . My one luxury was my forty-dollar car . That 's what I paid for it , and it was worth that price . The driver 's door was jammed shut , so to get in and out I 'd have to climb through the window , and it burned so much oil that every forty or fifty miles I 'd stop at a gas station and pour used oil into the crankcase . In those days you could buy oil that had been drained out of other cars very cheaply , which was my price . Generally I 'd pour in oil once a day . // When that summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theatre in Ottawa-as their assistant manager . Again my uncanny ability to lose tickets and mix up reservations-although sometimes I would mix up tickets and lose reservations- ended up with me joining the cast-at a salary of thirty-one dollars a week ! // During my second season in Ottawa a woman contacted me and told me very seriously that a company was being formed to perform Shakespeare in Stratford and invited me to join the company . I thought she was kidding . Give up a secure job that paid thirty-one dollars a week to go to some little town and become a member of some Shakespeare company I 'd never heard of ? What did they think I was , an actor ? // " Thank you , " I said , " but I have a regular job and I 'm going to keep that one . " // The Stratford Shakespeare Festival opened and within months had become celebrated throughout Canada and eventually around the world . //
