twice a year , every year , the sucias show up . Me , Elizabeth , Sara , Rebecca , Usnavys , and Amber . We can be anywhere in the world-and , being sucias , we travel a lot-but we get on a plane , train , whatever , and get back to Boston for a night of food , drink ( my specialty ) , chisme y charla . ( That 's gossip and chat , y'all . ) We 've done this for six years , ever since we graduated from Boston University and promised each other to meet twice a year , every year , for the rest of our lives . Yeah , it 's a big commitment . But you know how melodramatic college girls can get . And , hey , so far we 've done it , you know ? So far , most of us have not missed a single meeting of the Buena Sucia Social Club . And that , my friends , is because we sucias are responsible and committed , which is way more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ed the bigheaded Texican in particular . I 'll get to that in a minute . I 'm here waiting for them now , slouched in an orange plastic window booth seat at El Caballito restaurant , a Jamaica Plain dive that serves Puerto Rican food but calls it " Cuban " in hopes of attracting a more upscale clientele . It has n't worked . The only other customers tonight are three young tigres with fade haircuts , baggy jeans , plaid Hilfiger shirts , gold hoops flashing on their earlobes . They speak slangy Spanish and keep checking their beepers . I try not to stare , but they catch my eyes a couple of times . I look away , examine my newly French-manicured acrylic nail tips . My hands fascinate me because they look so feminine and together . With one finger I trace the outline of a cartoon map of Cuba printed on the paper placemat . I linger briefly on the dot representing Havana , try to picture my dad as a schoolboy with shorts and a tiny gold watch , looking north across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , one of the young men stares me down . What 's his problem ? Does n't he know how gross I am ? I turn my eyes toward the cars inching through the snow on Centre Street . The flakes twinkle in the yellow glow of headlights . Another dreary Boston evening . I hate November . Got dark at about four this afternoon , been spitting ice ever since . As if the wood paneling on the walls and the old buzzing refrigerator in the corner of the small restaurant were n't depressing enough , my sighing keeps fogging up the window . It 's hot in here . Humid , too . The air smells of cheap men 's cologne and fried pork . Someone in the kitchen sings off-key to a popular salsa song while dishes crash and clang . I strain to understand the lyrics , hoping they 'll match the peppy rhythm and lift me out of my funk . When I realize they 're about a love gone so wrong the guy wants to kill his lover or himself , I stop trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my warm bottle of Presidente beer , burp silently . I 'm so tired I can feel my pulse in my eyeballs . They sting under dry contact lenses every time I blink . I did n't sleep last night , or the night before , and I was too tired to take the contacts out . I forgot to feed the cat , too . Oops . She 's fat ; she 'll survive . It 's Ed , of course . The thought of him makes my heart seize up and my forehead get lumpy . You can tell what stage I 'm at in my doomed relationships by the state of my fingernails . Good nails : bad relationship , keeping up appearances . Ugly nails : happy Lauren letting herself go . You can also tell by how fat I am . When happy , I keep food down and stay around a size ten . When sad , I vomit like a Roman emperor and shrink to a six . My lavender size eight Bebe pants , wool and low on the hips , are baggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the space in them , rubbing . Ed , the bigheaded Texican , is a speechwriter ( read : professional liar ) for the mayor of New York . He is also my long-distance fianc . According to his voicemail at work ( I busted into it , I can not tell a lie ) he appears to be messing around with a chick named Lola . I joke not . Lola . What is that ? And where 's that waitress ? I need another beer . I 'll tell you what it is . It 's the universe demonstrating once more how much it hates me . I 'm serious . I 've had a crappy life , crappy childhood , crappy everything you can think of , and now , even though I 've made something not crappy of my professional life , all the aforementioned crap keeps coming back in the form of smarmy , good-looking dudes who treat me like , you guessed it , crap . I do n't pick them , exactly . They find me , with that whacked radar they share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tragic chick at the bar , sort of pretty , downing gin and tonics , weeping to self just stuck finger down throat in bathroom-screw her . Over . Yes , screw her over . As a result , I 'm the kind of woman who will search a man 's wallet and pockets and kick his ass if he does me wrong . I would stop this unacceptable behavior except I almost always find evidence of his wrongdoing-a receipt from the dinner he had at the dimly-lit Italian bistro when he said he was watching the Cowboys with his buddies , a scrap of napkin from a deli with the cashier 's phone number scrawled in the bubbly blue letters of uneducated , easy women . He always does something sneaky , no matter who he is . It comes with the territory of loving the unlovable disaster of me . Yes , I have a therapist . No , it has n't helped . There 's no way a therapist can solve the crisis of chronic , mother-sanctioned infidelity among Latin men . It 's not just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Union City says when I tell her my man is cheating ? " Bueno , fight harder for him , mi vida . " How 's a therapist gon na help me with that ? Your man cheats , these traditional women who are supposed to be , like , your allies-they blame you . " Well , " abuelita asks in raspy , heavily accented English , sucking on her Virginia Slims , " have you gained weight ? Do you make sure you look good when you see him , or do you show up in those blue jeans ? How 's your hair ? Not short again , I hope . Are you fat again ? " My therapist , a non-Latina with elegant scarves , thinks my problems stem from stuff like my dad 's " narcissistically self-absorbed personality disorder , " her diagnosis for the way he relates everything in life to himself , Fidel Castro , and Cuba . She 's never been to Miami . If she had , she 'd understand that all Cuban exiles older than forty-five do the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country more fascinating and important than Cuba , a Caribbean island with a population of eleven million . That 's about two million less than live in New York City . Cuba is also the mecca to which all older exiles still seem to think they will return " once that son of a bitch Castro falls . " Mass delusion , I tell you . When your family lives a lie that big , living with men who lie is easy . When I explain it all to my therapist , she suggests I give myself a " Cubadectomy " and get on with my American life . Not a bad idea , really . But like the children of most Cuban exiles I know , I ca n't figure out how . Cuba is the oozing recurrent tumor we inherit from our fathers . Right now , I think maybe a fling with one of the pretty-boy gangsters across the room might do the trick . Look how they eat with their fingers , the garlicky oil dripping from the shrimp into their sexy goatees . That 's passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save his life . I could do one of them for revenge , you know ? Either that , or I could eat cheese fries and donuts , get bulemic until the whites of my eyes turn the red of a heartache . Or I could go to my small apartment and slurp too many homemade screwdrivers , hide under my white goosedown comforter and cry while that intense Mexican singer Ana Gabriel-the one with the Chinese mom ? - wails on my Bose about the love she has for her guitar . I need a night with my sucias , y'all . Where are those girls ? Tonight is special , too , because this ( drumroll , please ) is the tenth anniversary of the very first time the sucias got together . We were all freshman journalism and communications students at Boston University , drunk off peach and blueberry girly beer ( hey , at least it was n't Zima ) bought with our fake driver 's licenses , playing pool at that dark , smoky Gillians club where everyone used to go , dancing to a throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us out on our sorry and naive culitos . We clicked that night . Or cliqued , rather . Oh , and puked . Almost forgot that part . Our Reporting 101 professor with the dyed-black comb-over told us it was the first time so many Latinas had enrolled in the communications program at once . He bared filmy yellow fangs as he said it , a " smile , " but trembled in his too-tight tweed blazer . We scared him , and people like him , as all things " minority " will-especially in Boston . ( I might get to that in a minute . ) Anyway , our collective power of intimidation in this increasingly Spanglish , Goya-beanified town was enough to make us instant and permanent best friends . Still is . A lot of you probably do n't speak Spanish , and so do n't know what the hell a " sucia " is . That 's okay . No , really . Some of us sucias ca n't speak Spanish , either-but do n't tell my editors at the Boston Gazette , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-hot-'n ' - spicy clichd chili pepper-ish cross between Charo and Lois Lane , and where , thank God , they still have n't figured out what a fraud I am . I 'm a pretty good journalist . I 'm just not a good Latina , at least not the way they expect . This afternoon an editor stopped by my desk and asked me where she might go to buy Mexican jumping beans for her son 's birthday party . Even if I were a Mexican-American ( and here 's a hint : I want to wax Frida Kahlo 's furry caterpillar unibrow and I 'm thoroughly uninterested in anything with the words " boxer " and " East L.A. " in it ) I would n't have known something that stupid . You might have imagined by now-thanks to TV and Hollywood-that a sucia is something beautiful and curvy and foreign , something really super Latina , you know , like the mysterious name of a tortured-looking , bloody-haired Catholic saint , or a treasured recipe from a short , fat , wrinkled old abuelita who works erotic magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mariachis wail , Salma Hayek flutters castanets , and Antonio Banderas romps a white snarfling horse through the cactus with , like , I do n't know what , a winged pig or some crap in his embroidered knapsack , and all of it directed by Gregory Nava and produced by Edward James Olmos . Get freaking over it , lames . It 's , like , so not . Sucia means " dirty girl . " Usnavys came up with it . " Buena sucia " is actually pretty offensive to most Spanish-speaking people , akin to " big smelly ' ho . " So Buena Sucia Social Club is , how do you say , irreverent . Right ? And obnoxious . It 's a pun , too , see , taken from the name of those old-as-dirt Cuban musicians who record with Ry Cooder and star in German documentaries , who every non-Latino I know thinks I am genetically predisposed to like . ( I 'm not . ) We 're clever and , like , hip when it comes to pop culture , we sucias . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're stupid . But we think it 's funny , okay ? Well , Rebecca does n't , but she 's about as funny as Hitler 's hemorrhoids . ( You did n't hear that from me . ) I check my Movado watch , a gift from three boyfriends ago . The watch has a blank face , like mine when the man who gave it to me told me he was going back to his ex . Ed thinks I should n't wear it anymore , says it upsets him . But I 'm , like , dude , if you bought me anything halfway decent I 'd throw it out . It 's a nice watch . Reliable . Predictable . Not like Ed . I 'm still early , according to it . I do n't need to get so nervous , then . All I need is another beer to calm my nerves . Where 's that waitress ? They 'll be here in a few minutes . I 'm always early . It 's the reporter training-come late , lose the story . Lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy in the newsroom accuse you of not deserving your job . She 's Latina , all she has to do is shake her butt and she gets what she wants around here . One of them actually said that once , loud , so I could hear . He was in charge of compiling the TV listings , and had n't written an original sentence in about fifty-seven years . He was sure his fate was due to affirmative action , especially after the editor in chief of the paper had me and four other " minorities " ( read : coloreds ) stand up during a company briefing in the auditorium , just so he could say , " Take a good look at the faces of the future of the Gazette . " I think he felt quite politically correct at that moment , as all those blue and green eyes turned to me in-what was it ? - in horror . Here 's how my job interview went : You 're a Latina ? How ... neat . You must speak Spanish , then ? When you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due in a month , what do you say to a question like that , even when the answer is no ? Do you say , " Hey , I noticed your last name is Gadreau , you must speak French then ? " Nah . You play along . I wanted that gig so bad I would have tried speaking Mandarin . With a name like Lauren Fernndez , they figured Spanish was part of the package . But that 's the American disease as I see it : rampant , illogical stereotyping . We would not be America without it . I admit I did n't tell them I was half white trash , born and raised in New Orleans . My mom 's people are bayou swamp monsters with oil under their fingernails and a rusty olive-green washing machine in front of the doublewide , the kind of people you see on Cops , where the guy is skinny as a week-dead kitten , covered with swastika tattoos and crying because the police blew up his meth lab . Those are my people . Them , and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this and more that I wo n't bore you with right now , I have molded myself into a chronic overachiever , and have focused my entire existence on a singular goal : succeed at life-meaning work , friends , and family-in spite of it all . Wherever possible , I dress as though I sprang from a completely different and much more normal set of circumstances . Nothing thrills me more than when people who do n't know me assume I 'm from a typical , moneyed Cuban family in Miami . Continues ...
