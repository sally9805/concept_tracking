Despite writing unclear , ideologically ponderous prose , Henry Giroux has produced a slew of books and articles that have found places in college courses and graduate schools of education . He is without question the United States ' most prominent radical educational theorist , known best for applying Paulo Freire 's pedagogy of the oppressed to the " critical consciousness " of young Americans . A teacher in training might be assigned Giroux 's writings in a half-dozen courses ranging from curriculum building and political foundations to language development , culture studies , and literary theory . <p> Strategically , the best way for his opposition to handle Giroux is to ignore him . His writing will befuddle and weary would-be supporters , while harsh condemnation might increase their sense of being put upon by the forces of hegemonic neo-colonial McCarthyite reaction . Strategy aside , however , Giroux 's work is so tellingly wrong-headed as to make irresistible the urge to give it a sound public smacking . <p> A useful point of organization is to note a change in the focus of Giroux 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of his writing ( roughly the 1980s period ) was given over to educational theory . Despite being nominally on something so practical as educating the young , these works barely touched down on the planet Earth ; abstractions piled on abstractions , all dismissive of life as actually lived . The later writing , still densely theoretical , has looked at specific " cultural texts " ( films , advertisements , television shows ) that exert a pedagogical force on the nation 's youth . Giroux finds such influence generally crippling of mind and spirit , but he does have praise for " oppositional " art down to the level of rap and punk rock . In addition , he has told some stories about growing up in Providence , Rhode Island , that are revealing in ways he does not intend . <p> The plan of this essay is to treat the stages separately and then consider the blend of the two . While the writing in the first stage is entirely off-putting , Giroux 's later pieces are more winning , sometimes conveying in clear language a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Giroux 's cultural criticism are well worth stinging , and his writing against these has a clarity and force previously undetected . He takes sure aim at Calvin Klein advertisements showing young bodies in a heartless group-grope and has appropriately harsh words for films like Juice , Slacker , My Own Private Idaho , and River 's Edge as well as the studied , violent " cool " of Quentin Tarantino 's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction . To his credit as well , he does not understate the appeals to sexism , violence , and ethnocentrism in rap and rock music . <p> In the end , though , discussion of Giroux 's work as a whole has to focus on its distortion . This essay will document how dangerously it advocates extended democracy in undemocratic , inaccessible language ; how little it sees of the society and schools it condemns ; how easily it accepts quasi-official classes of victimization ( race , gender , class ) as the centers of personal identity , political power , and moral agency ; and how unwilling it is to face up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to America 's youth . I. <p> The meshing of style and substance is nowhere better shown than in the turgid sentences and murky concepts of Henry Giroux 's theoretical writings . Like Homer 's oral epics , Giroux 's theory-works are largely made up of formulas and repetitions . A sure marker here is that one can pull words out of any Giroux theoretical piece and see that they could fit in anywhere , be dropped into any section of any of these writings without loss of meaning or grace . <p> Consider a typical passage : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Is this gunk from Ideology , Culture and The Process of Schooling ( 1981 ) , or Theory and Resistance in Education ( 1983 ) , or Schooling and the Struggle for Public Life ( 1988 ) , or perhaps Teachers as Intellectuals : Toward a Critical Pedagogy of Learning ( 1988 ) or Border Crossings ( 1992 ) ? One simply ca n't tell , as Giroux has so thoroughly overcome the phallologocentric instinct to stay on topic that there really is no " topic " in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on about his usual this and that at a level of abstraction too far from shore to be anchored to anything stable . Stability here would involve the answers to questions that Giroux never pauses to ask , questions like " Does n't it matter what age the students are ? What subject has this person been hired to teach anyway ? And how is one supposed to get all this political teaching past supervisors , colleagues , and parents ? " No , such matters are for workaday chumps , beneath the notice of educational theory . <p> So what is " educational theory " ? At first glance , it seems to be any comment on educational practice past the immediacy of " Write clearly on the blackboard . " But to Giroux and his circle , educational theory is defined by ideological guidance in a particular direction : " Theory " provides principles to reshape schools in the service of equality of results , multiculturalism , feminism , the inspiration to resist capitalist hegemony , and so on-the Post-Marxist , Postmodern Left agenda . If I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that is not educational theory . But if a Henry Giroux says , " Schools need to abolish ability grouping because it is a hegemonic racist-classist practice , " the Harvard Educational Review will rush to publish it as educational theory at its finest . Go figure . <p> In the passage above , note well the role of teachers : making the accepted " problematic " in students ' eyes . Nowhere in the huge Giroux corpus are teachers encouraged to master an academic discipline and learn to put it across . Nowhere , more broadly , can a scholarly , academic purpose for schooling be detected . Teachers are to think of themselves as " culture workers " and " transformative intellectuals " who guide students to question and then reject all that defines the United States as what it is-a vile oppressor-nation . <p> Note too the determinism of a phrasing like " ideologies and social practices inscribe students in various subject positions . " To Giroux , the individual self is a fantasy , akin to the conservative conceit that people make their own lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talent . Here we see the first trap of over-theorizing : making far too much of not very interesting or original insights . In common language , Giroux 's idea is trivially true , that what we 're exposed to has a strong effect on who we become ; no one would disagree . Expressing this in theory-talk , as the formation of identity and consciousness by exposure to cultural patterns mediated by language , gives it the gloss of a pronouncement from above , an untestable law of social psychology to which only the select few have access. 1 <p> Absent baleful cultural-linguistic influences , everyone apparently can be redirected to become non-racist , non-sexist , altruistic , accepting , a sharer , a giver , a perfect Left-Green citizen of the planet . It 's no mistake that some of Giroux 's strongest invectives have been directed at the canon , readings like Augustine 's Confessions and King Lear that depict human nature as a tad less malleable and benign than this . Taking such pessimism out of students ' faces is one attraction of moving to contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , furthermore , that the selections will never depict members of the " represented " group in any but the most flattering of lights . The only villains emerging will be rich white males and their retainers . Neutralize their influence , and . paradise ! Postmodern Theory connects to the Enlightenment selectively and stupidly , clutching at Rousseau 's utopian optimism while trashing epochal insights into the powers of reason in personal and political life . <p> Claiming that schools must prepare students for life in the postmodern world , Giroux never makes clear whether postmodernism is a philosophical choice to understand the world in a certain way or an empirical claim on the world itself . On the former interpretation , analogous to the choice of a disciplinary perspective like that of historian or biologist , one 's natural response would be , " What possibly can be gained through a choice to see the world as fuzzy , disordered , and without truth , morality , or reality external to a biased observer ? " Value judgments aside , Giroux on this interpretation invites other perspectives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinker to allow for pluralism of this kind . <p> Giroux 's claim that we live in a postmodern world surely is meant to be empirical , and then it is a gross overstatement . The world offers a mixture of pre-modern , modern , and some few postmodern elements . Why is it even important , much less epochal , that some individuals now say their very human things into a cell phone , or write them on a word processor and fax or email them ? Today 's San Francisco Chronicle features stories on pedestrians getting run over , gangs shooting up each other 's membership , and big crowds at the Giants games . Postmodern ? It 's all in Juvenal , down to the tattoos . <p> Here one questions Giroux 's strong links to Freire . Talk about pre-modern : Freire 's work was with adult illiterates in remote , isolated Brazilian tribes . One can not imagine a less apt model for U.S. education . The attraction , of course , is ideological , as Freire scorns First World school practices as exemplifying the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " liberatory , " politicizing education to guide students to collective action against capitalist oppression and cultural domination . Attempts to apply Freire 's work in schools in the cities and suburbs of the United States should be seen as a desperate grasping at straws after the demise of orthodox Marxism. 2 <p> But amazingly , Giroux does consider U.S. women , non-whites , gays , and working-class whites to be very much like Freire 's subjugated , silenced Brazilians . To " see " any analogy here , Giroux indulges in the crudest , most reductive of stereotyping . A theoretical champion of radical democracy , Giroux is remarkably uninterested in letting people speak for themselves , surely because so few think and act as he wants them to . The only voices besides his own heard in his works are those of fellow radical theorists , whom Giroux quotes and quotes and quotes some more-largely , one feels , to give readers confidence that he is n't the only person in the world to think this bizarrely . <p> Giroux also argues for a very unlikely vehicle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new communities " that experiment in radical democracy and serve as seed-beds for wider experimentation . For all his theoretical demands to historicize , Giroux offers readers no historical perspective on calls like these . Surely he knows the record of experimental socialist communities in America and elsewhere and now chooses not to report on their failures , both internally and as models . And does he forget that some of us actually lived in communes and remember without fondness being harangued for eating too much of the hummus and not interacting enough with crazy Louise ? II . <p> A favorite sentence-pattern of Giroux 's begins " Educators must . " or " Educators need to .. " There is an implied If-clause with all these injunctions : " Educators must treat students certain ways if their students are going to get out and change the world in ways I want them to . " A glorious revolution is there to be made , but no one is making it : We need agents , we need hands , we need converts ! <p> It 's fascinating , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements . His writings are remarkably generous to certain feminists and intellectuals of color , i.e. , those who share his sense of where feminism and racial politics fit into a larger Leftist struggle . Like Jesse Jackson 's Rainbow Coalition , the catch netted by Giroux will gain in number and political potential what it loses in sharp focus . Like the Rainbow Coalition as well , Giroux is cavalier to the point of shameful irresponsibility about what he 'd replace our present arrangements with . He offers nothing about how to provide sustenance and shelter for the millions and nothing about decision-making and getting things done in a " radically plural democracy " that makes Difference its fundamental principle of organization . It is only by slighting these matters that Giroux can reject the status quo in the absolute , totalistic terms of Postmodern Theory . <p> Conceptual fuzziness here emerges as a major political plus . Vague , undefined terms like " oppression , " " social justice , " " equality , " and " liberty " are better suited to recruiting the young and the uneducated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even more attractive , the fuzzy generalities define and protect a role for the theorist . Otherwise a distressingly white , male , heterosexual , well-off professional , Giroux now is objectively needed to correct the limited visions of oppressed Others-at the very least , to tell them who Jacques Derrida , Pierre Bourdieu , and Antonio Gramsci are , what they are trying to say , and how bowing in deference to their 100-percent European works constitutes a negation of Eurocentrism . In arguing for " a deliberate attempt to decenter the American literature curriculum , " Giroux writes : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> How it " empowers , " e.g. , Tongan-American students to have a Tongan-American poem assigned as literature classwork is entirely unclear . Does Giroux really think that Tongan kids ' academic performance , self-image , and status in the eyes of classmates will be raised thereby ? How this minor school reform will improve the fortunes of the Tongan-American community writ large is entirely unclear as well . Two points , however , are perfectly clear : Giroux has never asked a Tongan-American what he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sense of dreamily ideological objectives at the nexus of education , culture , and politics , Tongan-Americans will need the kind of guidance that the Vanguard Left has always been quick to offer . <p> One would love just to leave the Postmodern Theory Hierarchy at their convention , listening sleepy-eyed to interminable babbling about subaltern modalities of Lacanian signification and trying to balance the screeches of ludic post-feminists with the posturings of militant Afrocentrists and zany Luddites . Unfortunately , all this foolish noise has been granted direct , immediate outreach to schools , where children like my son and daughter are impressionable and eager to please . <p> Concerning schools , Giroux is fight about many things . Children past elementary school age should be encouraged and educated to be critical thinkers , with a strong intellectual voice . Likewise with students coming to treat personal differences less condemningly-differences in race , language , customs , sexual orientation , and so on . We will disagree on how best to get this done , but if schools can contribute to the embracing of what we ingenuously used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Likewise with helping students develop into active , involved citizens . <p> One wishes that Giroux had been satisfied to remain a practitioner writing to respected fellow practitioners on points like these . In the end , what is most irking about his theorizing is its delusional quality , how it fabricates laws out of tendencies , concocts allies , and , in the ignoble tradition of Heidigger , gets so wrapped up in its own abstractions that it misses the brunt of the actions it calls for . You want to speak to Giroux person-to-person and say , " Look , Henry , you 've got three choices here . Be a philosophy professor . Or do something to improve schools , in all their sloppy human imperfection . Or follow your star and be a revolutionary , a pamphleteer at the factory gate . But please , do n't keep trying to finesse a blend of these incompatible roles . It just does n't work ; it makes for bad writing , worse politics , and stay the hell away from my children . " III . <p> Giroux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 ) , Fugitive Cultures ( 1996 ) , and Channel Surfing ( 1997 ) , has focused on representations of youth in songs , films , advertisements , and television shows . Applied to educational theory , the interest in culture studies serves two main purposes . First , students carry to school deeply felt connections to popular culture , and Giroux believes schools should center curriculum on these connections . Second , popular culture shapes children , teenagers , college students , and adults , mostly reinforcing hegemonic social codes and institutional norms . To dislodge the hold of " the dominant culture " is the summum bonum of " culture workers " of Giroux 's persuasion , and school seems to them the obvious place to effect such a dislodging ; it 's not as though schools are doing anything else worth doing ! <p> Fully aware that cultural conservatives like Bob Dole also have taken advertisers , film makers , and musicians to task , Giroux twists and dodges to dissociate himself from that kind of critique . He is quick to point out and lambaste other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful : Disney Studio cartoons , William Bennett 's Book of Virtues , right-wing talk radio , and Arnold Schwarzenegger/Bruce Willis films . In discussing all cultural texts , furthermore , Giroux emphasizes ( following Foucault ) the power relations depicted , castigating hegemonic elements wherever he sees them . He can put down Dole , then , in these terms : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Apparently one needs to be ideologically qualified to decry sexploitation , slasher movies , and " Cop Killer " videos , and only Postmodern Leftist radicals qualify. 4 <p> Not reviews or artistic evaluations , Giroux 's essays are better described as ideological critiques of hegemonic common sense as displayed in pop culture . Calvin Klein and Benetton ads and films like Pretty Woman , Good Morning Vietnam , Dirty Dancing , Beauty and the Beast , Pocahontas , and New Jack City , he tries to show , are full of racism , sexism , colonialism , and class bias that others might miss , inured as they are to these pathologies of late capitalism . It is never clear why Giroux picks one film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he can not provide a shred of evidence that anybody is actually affected by a cultural text in the ways he supposes . Still , the discussions are lively and sometimes quite insightful . <p> Nothing that Giroux writes , however , suggests the good sense of centering the school curriculum on popular culture . Having dismissed traditional schooling as hegemonic and worse than useless , Giroux is never in the position of weighing the benefits of studying grammar , mathematics , chemistry , or history against those of ideological critique . Anyone less invested in eradicating the traditional curriculum will be extremely hesitant to give classrooms over to discussions of Snoop Doggy Dogg 's latest paean to female hind-parts . <p> Here one wonders about the educational values and powers of " the dominant culture . " Where exactly on television , in the movies , on the radio do we observe young people being guided to value hard work , self discipline , obeying your boss , and saving your money ? Where are they led to treasure and seek after the lifestyle of ascetic refinement that defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " dominant " media include plenty of Snoop Doggy Doggs , Madonnas , Jackie Chans , and variants of John Belushi 's character in Animal House , but no scholars or intellectuals . The " dominant culture " increasingly prizes flashy appearance , easy pleasure , and crass materialism , putting across all these in the spirit of rebellion against the uptight and nerdy . School fits in poorly with " the dominant culture , " and this is precisely why teaching has gotten harder and harder over the years . If the Ruling Class really had its way , would U.S. schools be bloody last in the developed world in physics ? <p> No question , growing up in the United States has become harder , grittier , since the early 1960s . Giroux 's understanding of this is entirely partisan , however , as though the only significant variables here are increasing commercialization , the flight of capital and jobs overseas , and the reduction of government services . Reading Giroux , one would think the Left had no complicity in making life harder for children . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made raising the young seem , like , a drag , man ? Was n't it H. Rap Brown , Huey Newton , and the Weather Underground who lavished praise on senseless gun violence ? Was n't it guitar-god Eric Clapton , and not William Bennett , who lavished praise on cocaine ? Was n't it a prominent feminist attorney who proclaimed that " a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle , " helping to set the cruelest norm of all for children , that they grow up without a trace of a father ? There 's plenty of blame to go around . To see only one kind of cultural abandoning of the youth is to write off any hope of speaking effectively to their problems . IV . <p> To everyone but Postmodern Leftists , the key " cultural " feature of U. S. education is how successful certain groups have been in school . Overachievers include preppies who are the children , grandchildren , and great-grandchildren of preppies , but also impoverished , marginalized groups like Jews , Chinese , and Vietnamese that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the curriculum . The common-sense instinct is to describe in detail the family and community practices that led to such success and then put these forward , without further judgment , as cultural models for stimulating academic development . <p> This , of course , has no connection to what Giroux plans . He takes school success , by an individual or a cultural group , as a mark of servile accommodation , an occasion for shame and blame rather than praise and emulation . Extraordinary school failure by a cultural group is a mark of the Ruling Class 's having identified the group as one to be dominated and super-exploited . Such a group perforce treats the school as a site for resistance , developing strategies to combat schools ' nefarious practices . The plan , then , is to re-do schools to make the failing groups ' ways the ways , " inverting the hegemony . " How this does anyone any good at all is beyond Giroux 's powers of explanation . <p> The problem here comes across clearly in Giroux 's reminiscences about growing up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white-working-class peers with no use for school ( " We were loud and unruly in classes . we cheated whenever possible " ) , shaking down more affluent classmates for money , and hating the college students who walked through their neighborhood ( " We taunted them , mugged them on occasion . " ) . On reflection , Giroux sees his peer-group as members of a Fugitive Culture , only partly aware of how wretchedly society had treated them and not sophisticated enough to " join in alliances with those diverse others who were oppressed . " <p> I empathize with the frustrations of growing up in a run-down section of a grimy city whose jobs are fast fleeing south ; this was my background as well . There is an unfairness , a cruelty , in some kids ' having next to nothing while others are given almost everything as a birthright . For all its flaws , the undeniable power of Jonathan Kozol 's Savage Inequalities lies in showing just that. 5 Resigned acceptance of a flat , third-class life is not what schools should be offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . <p> Where to go further with this thinking remains an open question , and here Giroux is of little help . Literally anything seems better to him than to suggest that kids keep their noses clean , study hard , outwork their competition , and set their children up to do much better than they . Disdaining such hegemonic common sense , Giroux romanticizes and overvalues destructive , counter-productive , low forms of oppositional behavior . In praising " punk culture , " for example , Giroux writes glowingly of its " contain ing the basis for interrogating and struggling to overthrow all those forms of human behavior in which difference becomes the basis for subjecting human beings to forms of degradation , enslavement , and exploitation . " He is talking here about pierced eyebrows , loud pounding music , look-at-me hairdos , and intolerance for everybody else 's cultural styles-hardly a basis for ending man 's inhumanity to man . <p> Writing on " oppositionality , " Giroux seems always to be thinking about the slave cook spitting in Massa 's soup , then applying criteria for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely analogous . In his reminiscences , e.g. , Giroux and his friends from Providence come across not as of a Fugitive Culture nobly resisting oppression but simply as jerks . Their teachers would depict Giroux 's group as uncooperative and belligerent ; the mugged collegians would depict them as stupid assholes . Giroux counters these perfectly accurate judgments with the Postmodernist strategy of telling how things looked to him at that time and assuming that all such viewpoints are equally valid. 6 Even on reflection , Giroux can not bring himself to say that he and his friends did anything wrong . <p> Wrong , in Giroux 's canon , describes the actions , attitudes , and ideas only of wealthy white males ; everybody else gets a pass . A major lacuna in Giroux 's lexicon of educational theory is a class of words to describe American children and teenagers whose strongest ( or only ) aptitude is for making things worse ; kids who blame others for their own failings , squander the opportunities placed before them , and abuse innocents . Everyone can come up with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for hassling the weak and disfavored , and for generally acting beneath what we have been taught . In pandering to the shadiest of excuses and rationalizations , the Left-political equivalent of " The dog ate my homework , " Giroux shows how desperate he is to recruit to his cause any minor who demonstrates " oppositionality . " <p> Consider in this light the matter-of-fact tone of the following : " The second month into the school year I noticed that every day during lunch hour a number of black kids would cut in front of white kids in the food line , shake them down , take their lunch money . " Giroux himself was spared this treatment because of basketball team connections , but that only begins to explain his lack of judgment against blacks who , in addition to blowing off schoolwork , hassled and robbed white classmates . <p> Giroux sees white racism everywhere , qualitatively the most significant variable affecting the lives of African-Americans and other racial minorities. 7 Cultural text that depicts " people of color " is , to Giroux , racist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every word , every action . In both art and life , that is , " people of color " are not to be held responsible for what they do . However progressive Giroux believes himself and is taken by others to be , this thinking could not be more reactionary . Giroux 's closest antecedent here is not W.E.B . DuBois or Antonio Gramsci but Lester Maddox , who like Giroux argued that " people of color " should think of themselves and be taken by others not as fully human agents . <p> All of Giroux 's arguments for placing racial identity at the center of personal identity feed right into a central factor retarding academic achievement among blacks and Latinos : the perverted notion that doing well in school is " acting white , " another idea Lester Maddox and David Duke would love. 8 Moreover , the kind of Progressive Education that Giroux argues for , using students ' life-experience as the starting-point and ongoing reference-point for all other studies , favors affluent , culturally advantaged students over those less groomed at home for academic success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , democratically , by the parents of less advantaged students and by the students themselves. 9 V. <p> Giroux wears his " working class white " origins like a crown , but someone like Eric Hoffer far better exemplifies the working-class intellectual : a plain-talking , practical idealist , his imagination unfettered by academic convention and the pro forma need to cite source after source . Certainly Giroux is to be congratulated for pulling together an impressive rsum starting from the unpromising background he describes . He sees nothing , however , of the genius of this country in his own story , the giving of chance after chance , the very possibility of rising from the mean streets to the heights of professorial influence and status while articulating ideas totally against prevailing norms . <p> When Giroux makes grave pronouncements about the need for an educated citizenry in a democracy , he writes as if he is inventing something new for America , not restating what had been said by Washington , Franklin , Jefferson , Horace Mann , John Dewey , Hyman Rickover , James Conant , Mortimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about every other major commentator on and shaper of our schools . To his discredit , the most obvious ways in which Giroux differs from the tradition are in expecting all critical , independent-minded citizens to think like the Postmodern Left and in demanding that ethnicity and gender shape the role of citizen qualitatively more than they ever should . <p> I see in this and many other Giroux shortcomings the lack of the secondary education that he so foolishly pissed away . He appears to have no knowledge of or respect for mathematics , science , and technology . The " theory " he writes has no feel for story , the rhythms and emotional nuances of life , and , in close connection , for poetry , the ringingly true phrase to capture and glorify life as lived . The history he alludes to is a bare , partisan sketch , " oppression " wherever he can find or be led to it . He seems to have no idea of the significance of Pericles ' Athens , the Rome of Cicero and Augustus , Judaism , Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French and American revolutions , the U.S. Constitution , the observations of Crvecoeur and Tocqueville . United States history begins for him with the factory system , imperialism , and harsh Anglo-conformity . <p> This absence of perspective , of intellectual grounding and proportion , is precisely what positions Giroux so unfavorably beside someone like Mike Rose , whose excellent book Lives on the Boundary ( 1989 ) has all the ethical fervor of Giroux 's passages against poverty , prejudice , marginalization , and educational malpractice but qualitatively more to offer on what to do , now . His background equally as bleak as Giroux 's , Rose was sent to a no-nonsense Catholic high school , where committed , purposeful teachers worked with him to develop an ear for the language and a sense of the reach of Western history . Rose 's subsequent education and his career as a teacher-scholar were indelibly and favorably marked by this pedagogical labor . Right or wrong in its arguments , the clarity , logic , high-mindedness , and intelligence of Rose 's critique show the benefits of just the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good reason that he has been able to articulate yet . <p> It is touching to read Giroux 's recent descriptions of youth in crisis , but the feeling never leaves that he is not facing up to his own role in this . How many students have labored under teachers who had no academic aspirations for them , having read Henry Giroux ? How many students have been led by " critical pedagogy " to the conclusion that they , as Victimized Oppressed People , are justified in being sullenly withdrawn or openly hostile in school , then in doing whatever after school to anyone they disfavor ? How can Giroux tear down the foundations of morality and human agency in book after book of theoretical writing and then complain about the erosion of morality and human agency in our society ? Talking about the college students he mugged in Providence , all Giroux really needed to say was " I 'm sorry . " That is precisely what he needs to do more broadly for his country and its schools : Say " I 'm sorry for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repair the damage . <p>
