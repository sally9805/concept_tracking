China At first Ebony and I do n't want to , but then her mom , Ms. Giles , says she 'll pay us , and we say okay because Ebony 's twin sisters ' day care is n't that far , plus it 's across the street from McDonald 's . We wait in the playground tire swings , sipping Cokes and dipping nuggets in hot sauce , and I 'm wishing I 'd asked for sweet and sour , when we see him . I 'm guessing he 's younger than us , but he 's way bigger , and he 's real dark , and he does n't look around or anything . His eyes are set straight ahead , and he walks right by and up to the front-door stoop and just stands there , waiting . " We 're fine , thank you . And what 's up to you , too ? " Ebony goes , loud , so he 'll hear . Only he acts like he 's deaf or something . Ebony sucks her teeth for a minute , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was dressed half decent . " It 's hard to know if she truly cares about stuff like that or if she 's just trying to get me aggravated , for fun . So I tell her , " You 'd be fine if you were n't a bitch . " " Shut up . " " You know it 's true . " Ebony fakes a sulk , and I check him out again . " He would n't be fine anyway , " I go . " He 's scary . " What do you mean ? " " Look . " She sticks her foot way out and leans way over to pretend-tie her shoe . " You 're right , " she says . " He 's mad scary . " A bell rings , and the doors open . A bunch of little kids shoot through , andme and Ebony hop up out of the swings . A couple of day care ladies laze out behind the kids , and that boy crosses his arms and leans his back to the brick . Ebony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding some kind of Popsicle stick craziness . " What 's that ? " Ebony asks them . " A dollhouse , " Mattie says . " It 's not done , " Elaine says . " We have to make the roof . " " Hi , China , " Mattie says . " Hi , baby , " I go . " Hi , China , " Elaine says . " Hey , baby , " I tell her . They 're six but like it when I call them baby . Ebony 's not allowed . They get mad at her when she does it . They let me because I do n't have any little sisters , and I talk to them when Ebony just thinks they 're around to get on her last nerve . They would let our other best friend , Grace , because she 's white and she 's prettier than anything , only Grace would never say baby anyway . " China , look , " Ebony goes , poking me . One of the day care ladies is staring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I help you ? " she asks , nasty . The boy stares back at her . He does n't say a mad word . " Do you need something ? " the lady goes , like he better not . He keeps his face shut tight , and the lady opens up her mouth again , but then this real small kidway younger than the twinszooms out with this Popsicle stick thing and goes to the scary boy , " Mama sick ? " The scary boy gives the lady a big old cold eye and then scoops up the real small kid and flips him over his shoulder and takes off . The kid giggles like crazy . " Eric ! " he squawks . " Eric ! Let me go ! " " Bye , Mickey , " Mattie yells at the small kid 's upside-down giggly head . " Bye , Mickey , " Elaine yells . " Bye , y'all ! " he calls back . But that boy Eric , he does n't smile or slow down or anything . * On the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloons with Magic Markers , and they let me and Ebony carry the balloons home . When Ebony 's mom gets back from showing apartments , she taps at the bunches , making them nod and shiver all over their living room , and she goes , " In Just-spring when the world is mud-luscious the little lame balloonman whistles far and wee and eddieandbill come running from marbles and piracies and it 's spring when the world is puddle-wonderful . ' " " It 's not spring , " Ebony cuts in . " It 's summer . " Ms. Giles leaves the balloons and the poem and digs into her pocketbook . I wanted to hear the end , but Ebony hates it when her mother says poetry . She 's always making her mom stop in the middle like that . " Thank you , gifts , " Ms. Giles goes , and she hands us each a fresh green bill , stiff as a new bookmark . Ebony holds hers by the edges , pushes them forward , and then pulls them back to make a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then undo it flat again and snap it , like Ebony . " What 's the rest of that poem ? " I ask Ms. Giles . " Ugh , " Ebony moans . " Ugh right back , " I go . " Be patient with her , China , " her mother tells me . " Ebony 's poetry has n't bubbled up to the top yet . " That makes me picture the fish tank at school . " Mom ! " Ebony moans again . Her mother touches my chin with her fingertips . " China , " she goes , " your poetry is closer to the surface , just under your skin . " Ebony drags me to her room and then calls Grace so the two of them can tease me stupid . " Under her skin ! " Grace goes , all sarcastic . Ebony 's got her on speaker phone . " Y'all just wait , " I tell them both . At Grace 's I work on mini-collages from old magazines , to fit into flat plastic key chains , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their jeans . You have to do both projects just right , or you mess things all up . " Make sure you do n't get glue on the floor , " Grace reminds me for the millionth time . I do n't get an attitude . though , because of her mother . We 're not even supposed to be at Grace 's because her mom 's sort of mean and does n't like people who are n't white . I met Ms. Sanborn once on the sidewalk , and she was kind of nasty to me and Ebony both , but it was hard to tell if it was because we 're black or what , because she was mean to Grace , too , and Grace is white , plus she 's her mother 's own daughter . " Y'all want to sleep over this Friday ? " Ebony asks , right when I get done cutting out the words hip and sex . " Yeah , " I go , spotting ultra and fine and Wow all on one page . " Can you come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " Ebony says quick , so Grace wo n't have to . Grace rolls her eyes , which she is real good at , especially for a white girl . " Word , " she goes , just to make us laugh . That boy , Eric , stares right past us again and waits with his back to the day care wall . This time Ebony keeps her mouth shut about him , and I try to catch his eye , but he wo n't see me . The day care lady does n't say anything . She looks at him like he stinks or something , and he acts like she 's a speck of bug doo under his shoe . Another girl shows up waiting today , too . She 's younger than us , like that Eric boy , only she looks it more than he does because she 's real small and skinny . " Hi , " she goes when she has to pass us at the tire swings . " Hi , " we go . She sort of stops near us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day care door . Nobody knows what to say for a minute , so we all stare at him until Ebony finally goes , " You know him ? " " He switched to special ed last year , " the girl says . " He fights . " " Figures . " Ebony smirks . The girl kind of shrugs , while I kick at Ebony 's tire . " Is n't he ugly ? " Ebony goes to her , kicking my tire back . Then the doors swing open , and the kids spill out . A real small girl , the same size as that little Mickey , skips over to us , all excited . " Keisha ! " this real small girl squeaks . " We made cookies ! " " You make some for your mama and Nick ? " this Keisha asks her , all calm and still , like she 's grown or something . The small girl 's face goes guilty . Keisha rolls her eyes at us . " See you , " she says , and they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he grabs Eric 's hand and then hums a little while they walk down the stoop and away . Like he knows underneath that hard face , Eric 's smiling down at him . " You sure you do n't want to take some day classes in arts and crafts or karate ? " my mom asks , over the TV . " Uh huh , " I tell her . " Deadline 's next week , " she reminds me . " I just want to hang out this summer . " " Twelve-year-old girls ought to keep busy , " my daddy says to me . Then , to the TV , he goes , " What is the Suez Canal ? " He knows every Jeopardy answer . The only one I ever saw him miss was " What is sulfur ? " " I keep busy , " I tell him . " Grace and Ebony and me do stuff on our own . " " China 's getting a little pay each week to help Ebony watch the twins on their way home from day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're putting it all in the bank , right ? " he goes . " Wrong , " I say , and he tries to swat my behind , but I get away , because he never for real tries to get me , plus I 'm fast . Grace and Ebony do n't have daddies . Grace thinks her mother does n't even know who he is . Ebony 's lives somewhere in the South , and she has n't seen him since she was five . Ebony 's mother wo n't talk about him except to say that he loves Ebony but is n't enough of a man to know how to show it . They think my daddy 's mad cool partly because he 's got these slanty eyes like me , plus he 's got a pierced ear , plus he 's real nice . " Have you ever visited him at work ? " Ebony 's asking me . She 's pulling at the let-out hem of her jeans , to make fringes . She does stuff slower than Grace , who 's putting her jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Once , " I say . I 'm busy gluing all my cutout words onto three different pieces of small cardboard . When I 'm done , each collage will slip into a plastic key chain frame just like a picture would . " Did you meet a lot of stars ? " " There 's not really any stars on the news , " I answer . " But he 's going to switch over to a soap opera soon . " " I bet stars do n't even talk to the cameramen anyway , " Grace says , and then we hear the front door bang open and Grace 's mother yell , " I 'm home ! " " Shit , " Grace goes , and the next minute her mother 's standing in the bedroom doorway , hands on her hips , mouth wide enough to catch a truckload of flies . " Hi , Ms. Sanborn , " I go , to show her how polite black girls can be . " Hi , Ms. Sanborn , " Ebony goes . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looks real calm , but I can see a vein , or something , bouncing in her neck . " Nice to meet you , " Grace 's mom says . But she 's not looking at us , plus she met us once already . I guess she does n't remember . " Now you 'll have to leave . " " What a bitch , " Ebony says while we 're waiting for the day care to let out . We bought McDonald 's again , but we 're too mad to eat . " You think she 'll let Grace sleep over with us Friday ? " " You think she 's going to shit honey anytime soon ? " " Hey , " I go . " That boy is n't around . That Eric boy . " " What . You like him now ? " Ebony starts smirking . " It 's not like that , " I go . " Riiight , " she says , all attitude . " For real , " I tell her . The bell rings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of painted and strung-up macaroni . Bracelets , necklaces , belts . " Y'all want some nuggets ? " we ask . They grab them and run off to the jungle gym . I see that Mickey looking around . I see him walk to the playground 's fence . I see him stare over at a lady I did n't notice before who 's leaning on the fence gate . She 's way skinny and ashy like you never saw . Mickey scuffs over to her . She starts walking away as soon as he 's near . He speeds up to get next to her and hands over his macaroni necklace . She puts it on over her head , without stopping or even looking at him or anything . Today he 's not giggling . Or humming . " May I speak to Grace , please ? " I go . " No , you may not , " her mom says . " Grace is grounded from the phone . " " I 'm sorry we did n't have your permission , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still . " Your apology is accepted . " " We 're real clean , " I say . " And we do n't make any noise or bother your neighbors . " " I 'll tell Grace you called , " Ms. Sanborn says . " Grace is our best friend , " I tell her . " I 'm aware of that . " " Maybe you could ask our mothers to punish us instead , " I say . " Because , really , we kind of made Grace let us come over . " " Good-bye , " her mom says . Then she hangs up the phone . What a bitch . On Thursday me and Ebony do n't hang out together at Grace 's first , so we meet up at the day care . I get there early . That younger girl , Keisha , is hanging out by the tire swings . Eric 's leaning up against the wall . I wave to Keisha and then walk up the stoop to Eric . " Hi , " I go . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell . " You want a nugget ? " I ask . He glares at the nuggets , and then he glares at me . " I saw your mother yesterday , " I go . He wo n't say a mad word . Maybe it was n't even his mother . " Is she sick ? " " Get the fuck out my face , " he tells me . Friday Grace races into the McDonald 's right when me and Ebony are ordering . " Hey , girl ! " Ebony goes . " How 'd you get out ? " " I 'm grounded for a month , same for the phone , " Grace pants . " But my mom 's at work every day . So screw her . " She 's red and shiny from running in the heat . All the McDonald 's boys are staring at her under their baseball hats . She plays like she does n't notice , though . " My mom 's not paying you , " Ebony warns . " Like I want your money , " Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see Eric walking ahead of us . " That 's him , " Ebony tells Grace . " That 's the one China wants to get with . Is n't he nasty ? " " I do not either want to get with him , " I say . " And do n't call him nasty . Something 's wrong with his mother or something . " " So ? " Ebony goes . " He 's still nasty . " The thing I notice today just about knocks me over . You 'd think he 'd slide his eyes over Grace if he slid them over anybody . But it 's like he does n't even see her . The person he watches is Ebony when she stoops in the middle of the playground to help Mattie reglue her milk carton castle . Grace 's mother has a date with some new neighbor , so Grace sneaks out to Ebony 's . " Somebody would get with your mom ? " Ebony goes , and then she says quick , " No offense . " " Like I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , making brownies . When we 're at Ebony 's , we bake . At my house it 's usually popcorn . We do n't eat at Grace 's . " You girls want a movie ? " Ebony 's mother asks , poking her head into the kitchen . The phone rings , and Ebony grabs it . " Hello , " she goes . " That 's the twins , " her mom tells us . They 're at an overnight somewhere . " This is Ebony , " Ebony says . Then she gets real quiet . I guess it 's not the twins . " Who is it ? " Ms. Giles asks . " Uh huh , " Ebony goes . " Ebony ? " " I do n't remember , " Ebony tells the phone . " I did n't get any . " Then she says , " Hang on . " She holds out the phone . " He says he 's my daddy , " she goes . " He 's crying . " Ms. Giles grabs the phone and covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she orders us . " Now . " We stretch across Ebony 's bed and try to figure out how to listen in , but even though Ebony 's got mad phone stuff , like call waiting and speaker and three way , we ca n't figure out anything for spying . " What did he sound like ? " Grace asks . " He was all happy at first , " Ebony goes . " He was real happy . " She 's swinging around her sock monkey doll by his tail . " He was all how he sent me these letters on my birthdays , and did I like them . " " You never told us about any letters , " Grace says . " Well , I never got any , girl , " Ebony goes , popping Grace 's knee with that monkey . " You said he was crying , " I say . " He was . " " But you said he was happy . " " He was crying from happiness , " Grace guesses , rolling her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying when I told him I never got any dumbass letters . " We all think about that for a minute , trying to figure it out , and then Grace asks me , " Did you ever see your dad cry ? " " Nope . " " Did y'all ever see your mothers cry ? " Ebony goes . We shake our heads , and then Ebony 's mom walks in . " Was that really my daddy ? " Ebony asks . She does n't sit up or anything . She just keeps swinging that sock monkey over her head . " Yes , " her mom says . " Do you want to talk about this now , with your friends here ? " she goes . " Or do you want to wait until you and I can discuss it on our own ? " Ebony shrugs . Me and Grace look at each other . I know she 's hoping what I am . We want to hear all about it . " Maybe we should wait until tomorrow then , " Ms. Giles says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour later , and I wake up in the middle of the night without Ebony next to me . I get spooked , but when I find Ebony all tucked in with her mother , I step away because it seems like something private . " ... and how you first fluttered , ' " I hear Ebony 's mom whispering , " then jumped and I thought it was my heart . ' " At the tire swings Ebony chomps at her nails and spits the bits out in a pile . " That 's disgusting , " Grace tells her . Ebony 's daddy called again yesterday . Her mom does n't know . Ebony said he was telling her all about some woman he wants her to meet . Ebony said he was talking slow and sounded like he was forgetting words a lot of the time . Grace said maybe he 'd been drinking . " Y'all want to sleep over at my house on Friday ? " I go , while I 'm looking at Eric , trying to figure out what that mad bulge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I 'll come by for a while , " Grace goes . She 'll have to sneak out again . She 's still got a week left on punishment . Ebony squints over at Eric . " He stinks , " she tells me , evil . " I can smell him from here . " That 's a lie . " It 's not his fault , " I go . " How do you know ? " Grace says , not evil , only curious . " I just do . " " You 're the one who said he was scary , " Ebony tells me , standing up from the swings . " I changed my mind , " I say . " And stop talking loud . He 's not deaf . " " So ? " " Hi , girls , " we hear , and Ebony 's mother comes through the gate . " Do we still get paid for today ? " Ebony asks when her mom gets to our swings . " Of course , " Ms. Giles says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way to Fifth Street to show a two-bedroom . " I 'm trying to catch Eric 's eye , but he 's stupid stubborn . I guess Ebony 's mother sees me looking . " Who 's that ? " she asks . " Some fool , " Ebony says " He 's not a fool , " I tell them . " He kind of is , " Grace says . " He is not ! " I go , loud . " What 's your problem ? " Ebony snaps , and then Grace , instead of rolling her eyes at me , she sucks her teeth hard at Ebony and kicks near the fingernail pile . " He 's not a fool , " I tell Ebony 's mother . My voice is crazy shaky , and my face is all hot , and I do n't even know why . Ms. Giles puts her hand on my shoulder and looks over at Eric . I try to keep from crying while the bell rings and the kids fly through the doors . Ebony 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out , his nose all nasty . Eric yanks a tissue from his back pocket bulge and holds it up to Mickey 's face . " Blow , " he goes . " Battered by the tides like an abandoned ship , a spirit adrift , " Ms. Giles says , real low . " Mom ! " Ebony groans at her . " Just chill , " Grace snaps at Ebony . " Jesus . " " He 's got poetry , " I go , all choky . " He 's got mad poetry . " I get a runny head and start feeling wobbly , and my mom takes my temperature and then kicks my daddy off the couch during Jeopardy so I can lie down . My daddy gives me the clicker and sits in the armchair , and my mom puts the tissue box and a blanket , even though it 's about a million degrees outside , on the coffee table . Then she brings me this special kind of aspirin she gets for free from her boss at the drugstore and lemon honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy feels my forehead and the fat mug with the back of his hand and then makes my mom drop ice cubes into the tea , to cool it . " You 're going to kill her , " he scolds . " She 's going to melt like the Wicked Witch of the West . " Then they sit with me watching whatever I want to for a while , and right in the middle of a car commercial I understand " spirit adrift , " and I feel this thing ease through my skin with the fever , showing me how mad stupid mean the world can be and just how lucky I got , and it 's a warm sad feeling , like tea steam wrapping comfort around some new , crying part of my heart .
