<p> Georgia Tech returned to the business of basketball Monday by avoiding it . <p> Coach Paul Hewitt gave players the day off after they practiced Sunday . They 'll go through individual workouts today , practice Wednesday ( at Tech ) and Thursday ( in Chicago ) before playing UNLV on Friday in the first round of the NCAA tournament . <p> The Rebels ( 28-6 ) might offer some looks Tech ( 20-11 ) has n't seen , but do n't expect the Jackets to stray from what they 've been doing . <p> " To me it 's about doing what you do , " Hewitt said . " We 're going to press , play and run and play our normal allotment of guys . " <p> UNLV runs a three-guard offense with point guard Kevin Kruger , Wink Adams and Michael Umeh . Forward Wendell White is the Rebels ' best all-around player . <p> " Very strong on the perimeter , veteran on the perimeter . They execute very well , like a typical Lon Kruger team , " Hewitt said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressure you in the halfcourt , not so much in the fullcourt . When they double us , we have to make sure we keep good spacing . " <p> West makes 3rd trip <p> Graduate student Mario West has been to the NCAA tournament two previous times , including the Jackets ' trip to the 2004 title game ( and a journey to the NIT while redshirting as a freshman ) . After celebrating with teammates Sunday as the Jackets landed an NCAA bid , West did as West does . <p> He got serious . <p> " Mario was saying it 's a whole different season now , " junior Anthony Morrow said . " He said we 've got to make another run . It will be fun , but different . " <p> Aminu has wrist X-rayed <p> Sophomore reserve post man Alade Aminu , who had 17 points , eight rebounds , two steals and two blocks before fouling out Thursday against Wake Forest , had his sprained left wrist X-rayed Sunday . He was to undergo an MRI exam Monday . Hewitt said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to play no matter what . " <p> 24 hours of rest <p> Some fans noticed that in Wednesday 's open practice in Tampa , the day before Tech 's game against Wake Forest in the ACC tournament , the Jackets went at it considerably harder than other teams . Hewitt said that was because his team did n't play until 9:30 p.m . Thursday . <p> " I like to do that , but we wo n't do that on Thursday because the game the next day is early 12:25 p.m . Eastern time , " the coach said . " I always like to have them off their feet 24 hours before the next game . " <p> Rule hurts mid-majors <p> Just six of 34 at-large tournament bids went to mid-major teams , compared with eight last year when George Mason went all the way to the Final Four . <p> Hewitt has a pretty good theory on why the number decreased : He thinks the new rule mandating that all players be out of high school for at least one year before going into the NBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you start having all the best players from high school go to college for at least one year , there 's a difference , " he said . <p> And that 's because those ultra-elite players typically end up at big-time schools , pumping up those teams . They do not go to places like Drexel . <p> " No , they do n't , " the Tech coach said . <p> TOURNEY TRAVELERS <p> Former Hawks coach Lon Kruger , whose UNLV Runnin ' Rebels play Georgia Tech on Friday , will become one of just five coaches to lead four different teams to the NCAA tournament : <p> * Lefty Driesell : Davidson , Maryland , James Madison , Georgia State <p> * Jim Harrick : Pepperdine , UCLA , Rhode Island , Georgia <p> * Lon Kruger : Kansas State , Florida , Illinois , UNLV <p> * Rick Pitino : Boston University , Providence , Kentucky , Louisville <p> * Eddie Sutton : Creighton , Arkansas , Kentucky , Oklahoma State <p> EAST REGIONAL <p> First Round <p> Thursday <p> Winston-Salem , N.C. <p> Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , 12:25 p.m . <p> Georgetown ( 26-6 ) vs .
