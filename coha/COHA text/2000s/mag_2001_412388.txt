Spreading the word about the wonders of crystal-like geometric forms <p> A towering stack of 642 compact disks could represent an impressive music or software collection . The same number of CDs strung together into iridescent arcs can be a mathematical sculpture . <p> Such a glittering assemblage , more than 6 feet in diameter , hangs in an atrium of the computer science building at the University of California , Berkeley . Titled " Rainbow Bits , " the sculpture slowly rotates in response to air currents . Viewers experience a kaleidoscope of fleeting glints , dazzling colors , and shifting shadows . <p> Created by George W. Hart of Northport , N.Y. , the sculpture is more than an intriguing visual effect . Its strands of recycled CDs trace the edges of a novel mathematical solid-a polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles and 60 kite-shaped quadrilaterals . <p> This particular solid , which Hart dubs a propellorized icosahedron , is one example of a newly defined class of polyhedra . " As far as I know , these forms have never previously been described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture is just one of his many creations based on polyhedra . Hart has also collaborated with mathematicians and computer scientists to define and visualize a variety of new mathematical shapes . <p> " As a sculptor of constructive geometric forms , I try to create engaging works that are enriched by an underlying geometrical depth , " Hart says . " I share with many artists the idea that a pure form is a worthy object . " <p> Such forms tantalize artists and scientists alike . " George Hart is a very special individual , a gifted mathematician , a creative artist , and an inspiring teacher , " says Berkeley computer scientist Carlo H. SCquin . " He is among the very best of a rather small group of people who successfully integrate art and mathematics . Hart 's geometrical constructions are intriguing , educational , and artistic at the same time . " <p> The sculptor 's passion for polyhedra was already evident by the time he had reached his teen years . He enjoyed making large structures , including mathematical solids , by painstakingly gluing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about mathematical models , he later took to constructing intricate polyhedra out of paper . <p> Hart majored in mathematics , then earned graduate degrees in linguistics and in electrical engineering and computer science . He taught computer and engineering courses at Columbia University and Hofstra University in Hempstead , N.Y . Along the way , he wrote a textbook on multidimensional analysis , a branch of mathematics that relates physical measurements to one another . He also developed and patented methods for determining the energy consumption of individual appliances from measurements of total power used by a household . <p> Hart is currently a visiting scholar with the computational geometry group at the applied mathematics and statistics department of the State University of New York at Stony Brook . He devotes the bulk of his time , however , to his varied polyhedral pursuits . <p> " Polyhedra have an enormous aesthetic appeal , " Hart contends . Moreover , " the subject is fun and easy to learn on one 's own , " he notes . <p> Since 1996 , Hart has been building a remarkable Web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its enormous catalog of polyhedra now includes many solids never previously illustrated in any publication . <p> Hart 's Web pages " provide important information for my university courses on geometric modeling , " SCquin says . Furthermore , he adds , " they provide inspiration for me as a part-time artist , and they provide sheer visual pleasure for geometrically inclined minds . " <p> Polyhedra are made by linking triangles , squares , hexagons , and other polygons to form closed , three-dimensional objects . Different rules for linking various polygons generate different types of polyhedra . <p> The Platonic solids , known to the ancient Greeks , consist entirely of identical regular polygons , which are defined as having equal sides and equal angles . There are precisely five such objects : the tetrahedron ( made up of four equilateral triangles ) , cube ( six squares ) , octahedron ( eight equilateral triangles ) , dodecahedron ( 12 regular pentagons ) , and icosahedron ( 20 equilateral triangles ) . <p> If you relax the conditions for generating the Platonic solids and specify that faces must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 such polyhedra , known as Archimedean solids . One example is the truncated icosahedron , familiar as the pattern on a soccer ball , which consists of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons . Polyhedra also can be constructed from polygons that do n't necessarily have equal sides and equal angles , and they may be indented or spiky , like three-dimensional stars . The great stellated dodecahedron , first described by 17th-century mathematician Johannes Kepler , is one example of a spiky polyhedron . Nonindented polyhedra , such as the Platonic solids , are called convex . <p> Hart has delved deeply into the history of the discovery and representation of polyhedra . During the Renaissance , he notes by way of example , Leonardo da Vinci invented a way to show the front and back of a polyhedron without confusion by depicting edges as if they were made from wooden laths and leaving the polyhedron 's faces open . <p> Inspired by Leonardo 's drawings of wooden models , Hart has crafted his own beautiful models of these designs . He has also programmed computers that guide stereolithography machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the models . <p> With a vast palette of geometric solids to choose from , Hart has fashioned polyhedral models and sculptures from all sorts of materials and objects , including plexiglass , brass , papier-mchC , pipe cleaners , pencils , floppy disks , toothbrushes , paper clips , and plastic cutlery . <p> He " brings the ideal forms of the polyhedra into the material world with wit and humor , " says computer programmer and artist Bob Brill of Ann Arbor , Mich . " The austere beauty of the polyhedra is thus made accessible and familiar . " <p> Given the lengthy history associated with polyhedra , it may seem astonishing that there are still mathematical discoveries to be made . Hart has proved particularly adept at identifying rules and variants that lead to new possibilities . <p> For example , his discovery of propellorized polyhedra came out of a new notation for describing polyhedra , proposed by mathematician John H. Conway of Princeton University . In Conway 's scheme , a capital letter specifies a " seed " polyhedron . For example , the Platonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I. A lower-case letter then specifies an operation . The combination tC means truncate a cube ; that is , cut off the corners of a cube to form a new solid with six octagonal and eight triangular faces . Conway 's simple notation can be used to derive the Archimedean solids and infinitely many other symmetric polyhedra . <p> In the course of writing a computer program to implement Conway 's notation , Hart tried to think of a simple operator that was n't yet included in Conway 's list . He came up with what he called the propellor sic operation : Start with a polyhedron , then spread apart the faces and introduce quadrilaterals so that each face is surrounded by a ring of these forms . <p> " The propellor operation can be applied to any convex polyhedron and combined with other operations to produce a variety of new forms , " Hart says . " These provide a storehouse of intriguing structures , some of which have inspired artworks . " <p> Hart based his design for " Rainbow Bits " on an icosahedron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 equilateral triangles and 60 kite-shaped quadrilaterals . The resulting sculpture required one CD at each vertex , five CDs along each of the longer edges , and three CDs along each of the shorter edges . The positions and angles of slots cut into the CDs determined their placement . <p> " For many visitors , this stunning sculpture is a main attraction of our building , particularly when it is hit by rays of sunlight and sprays intense colored spots over the atrium walls , " SCquin says . <p> Working with Craig S. Kaplan of the University of Washington in Seattle , Hart has recently invented a procedure for generating many polyhedral forms , including new types of polyhedra . Dubbed symmetrohedra , these geometric solids result from the symmetric placement of regular polygons ( see illustration on page 397 ) . <p> The new technique generates a variety of known polyhedra , including most of the Archimedean solids , and infinitely many new ones . One particularly striking product is a polyhedron made up of 20 regular nine-sided polygons ( called enneagons ) , 12 regular pentagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enneagons in a polyhedron , " Hart comments . <p> In another recent effort , Hart and computer scientist Douglas Zongker of the University of Washington developed a novel method for constructing polyhedra by blending together two or more existing polyhedra . Hart , Zongker , and Kaplan all described their new visualization methods at a meeting that highlighted mathematical connections in art , music , and science , held last July at Southwestern College in Winfield , Kan . <p> Whether assembling an intricate polyhedral design , leading a model-building workshop , or describing his latest ventures , Hart brings an infectious enthusiasm to his task . To help spread the word about the beauty and joy of polyhedra , he recently coauthored a book on building models using Zome plastic components , producted by Zometool of Denver . Embodying mathematical ratios such as the golden mean , the system 's balls and sticks lend themselves to polyhedron building . On another communications front , Hart is now writing a history of polyhedral geometry in art . <p> " The best way to learn about polyhedra is to make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who prefer to skip the spilled glue , misshapen corners , ill-fitting edges , and hours of work , Hart 's Web site provides interactive , three-dimensional virtual models that can be observed from different perspectives . <p> Brill says about Hart , " His energy , his curiosity , his inventiveness appear to be boundless .
