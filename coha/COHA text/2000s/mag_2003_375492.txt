Where 's Madeleine Albright when we need her ? As the Bush Administration inches deeper into nation building in Iraq and closer to peacekeeping in Liberia , it would be nice to have an official around who actually believed that building nations and keeping the peace were worthy goals of U.S. foreign policy . <P> Albright did . During her time as President Bill Clinton 's ambassador to the U.N . and then as Secretary of State , she argued that the U.S. was the world 's " indispensable nation , " its muscle essential to solving humanitarian crises and eradicating their causes , wherever they arose . For their promiscuous deployment of American force in Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia and Kosovo , she and her boss were much derided . Republicans thought the Clinton Administration frittered away American power in places that were n't worth it , ignoring matters of vital U.S. national interest in favor of a feel-good , bleeding-heart preoccupation with the suffering of those unfortunate to live in places of no consequence . In a biting criticism , Michael Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clintonian strategy " foreign policy as social work . " Such an approach , Mandelbaum argued , was bound to be both prohibitively expensive and unlikely to sustain the support of the American public . <P> I called Mandelbaum last week and asked him whether he thought social work was now in style . " Indeed , " he said , and so it is . In Iraq today , U.S. soldiers are building soccer fields and standing guard over girls ' schools . This is being done in the name of an Administration whose members openly despised Clinton 's habit of using the armed forces for missions short of war . ( " We do n't need to have the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten , " said Condoleezza Rice , now National Security Adviser , to the New York Times in 2000 . ) As for Liberia , all the key phrases last week  --  the need for clearly defined missions and exit strategies , the desperate attempt to swear that , honest , only a couple of hundred American soldiers would ever go to West Africa  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expected someone to do the Macarena . A U.S. intervention in Liberia , let us be clear , would be for purely humanitarian , Albrightish motives . Notwithstanding the role the U.S. played in establishing the country , if you think what happens in Liberia is of the slightest importance to American interests , conventionally defined , you 've spent too long away with the fairies . <P> There 's more . The Administration justified the war in Iraq principally by alleging that Saddam Hussein 's regime had  --  or would soon have  --  weapons of mass destruction that could be used against the U.S. That was a pure national-interest case , for there 's nothing so threatening to a nation than weapons that might incinerate millions of its people . The trouble is , we have not found any such weapons , which has led some Administration supporters to shift their ground . Whether or not Saddam had nukes , they argue , his rule was so vile that getting rid of it was a service to mankind . That is true . But if the test for deploying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it poses to the U.S. but its wickedness , why stop at Iraq ? As Mandelbaum wrote seven years ago , " The world is a big place filled with distressed people . " Why not ease the suffering of those in , say , Burma or Zimbabwe ?
