KICKBOXING and other MARTIAL-ARTS-based workouts change the focus from how you look to what your body can do . Photograph // Women are powerful , especially when it comes to exercise . We created the need for an aerobic-shoe industry . We entered the terms " stair stepper " and " sports bra " into everyday language . But it was n't until recently that women really began showing their power . Over the past couple of years , we 've brought the martial arts into the American mainstream , filling up kickboxing classes in our gyms and buying thousands upon thousands of Tae Bo exercise videos . Why the adoration ? Kickboxing is a workout that engages the mind , the body , and the spirit all at once . Your brain works overtime to remember kick and punch combinations , while your body sweats and strains for strength and energy . Meanwhile , your spirit reaches deep and finally soars as it finds the will to protect your body from a potential attack . " The martial arts give you something else to focus on instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fifth-degree black belt in karate and founder of Kardio Kombat , a martial arts certification and teaching program . " in these classes , we do n't ask , ' How do you look ? ' We ask , " What are you made of ? " " And I , myself , can vouch for that . I took up kickboxing a few years ago , just when I was becoming fed up with a dead-end job and a frustrating career . While I loved the total-body workouts and the high-energy calorie-burning , it was n't until I took a class one day in a furious huff that I realized how liberating kickboxing could be . The energy I released during an especially hard-core workout inspired me to take control of the situation that had so aggravated me . I actually promised myself I 'd start job hunting in the middle of a combination right there in class . Of course , even without a burst of anger to work through , many women have found that nothing kicks their butts like the martial arts . And no wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exercise ( ACE ) proved that a 130-pound woman in an hour-long class will bum about 350-450 calories . That means cardio kickboxing is a real calorie-burner . So , although trainer Lisa Gaylord designed this workout focusing on the physical benefits of the martial arts , i.e. , developing strength and flexibility in your torso , legs and upper body , both Gaylord and Shape recommend that you also take the time to explore the emotional and mental benefits of these sports . " The martial arts will strengthen every part of you , " says Gaylord . " You 'll be encouraged to do things in class that you 're not allowed to do anywhere else in your life .

Before you head into a martial-arts school ( or dojo ) you 're probably going to ask yourself , " Am I going to have to throw someone over my head ? Break concrete ? Use a weapon ? " First , all martial arts usa variations of the same movements , such as kicks , punches , strikes and throws . However , some are considered " hard " ( based on attack ) , while others are considered " soft " ( focused on blocking and defensive moves ) , Here are some specifi ( s about a few types : Aikido 100-percent soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you use the energy of your opponent to turn an attack into a submission , using shields , rolls and throws . karate 50-percent hard/50-percent soft style . Karate was designed as a swift and aggressive means of self-defense , using blocking and strikes , but very little kicking . There is a wide variation in how it is taught , so you should ask the teacher ( or " sensei " ) about whether there is sparring in his or her cla Tae Kwon Do 75-percent hard/25-percent soft style ; uses both kicks and strikes . Most classes practice balance exercises , and some throws . KUNG FU 100-percent soft style . More properly called " wushu , " it 's the first known form of the martial arts .

But the martial arts rarely seek to create the types of warriors we see in the movies . " An American-style cardio-kickboxing class wo n't teach you how to defend yourself , so you do n't have to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaylord , founder of Kardio Kombat , a martial-arts certification and teaching program . " However , I believe everyone should take a self-defense or martial-art. class that specifically says it teaches selfdefense , because we 've all been in situations where we 've been scared and you need to know you have the skills to defend yourself . " Gaylord stre. , sse too , that a good self-defense class is more than just perfecting kicks and punches . " Self  --  defense is mental and a good instructor teaches you how to stay in control when you 're being attacked , " says Gaylord . " Most women and girls do n't ever punch and kick in their day-to-day lives , and some do n't feel free to express their anger even when they have a right to , so a self-defense teacher finds a way to allow you to use your power and instinct to protect yourself .
