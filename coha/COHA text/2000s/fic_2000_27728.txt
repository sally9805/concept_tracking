A phone is ringing in the distance . I do n't want to wake up yet . I am having a wonderful dream about a large apartment where everything is white , the whitest of whites . Music filters into my consciousness and I open my eyes . The digital clock glows greenly at me . I am listening to light music . The letters glow 7:48 which means it is really 7:18 . My clock is a half hour fast in the hopes that seeing the later time when I am not fully awake will propel me into action . It has n't yet . For a moment , I achieve consciousness and sum up the situation . It is my birthday . I am thirty-two . I am listening to light music , my boyfriend is commitment phobic and I 'm going to be late for work again . Pounding on the snooze button I flip over , disappearing into sleep . Seven minutes later , the phone rings again , insistently . I try to ignore it but it does n't stop . I stumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be a bruise on my thigh . " Hello ? " " Happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you ... " It 's my older sister Bette . I am thirty-two years old . " Stop , stop , " I cry . " Listen , have I reached the age where I have to start whiting-out my age on my passport , like Zsa Zsa Gabor ? " " The sooner the better . " " I think I 'll make this birthday the last one . " " Just remember ... " " I know , I know , all of life 's problems can be solved by a hot milky drink . " My sister is writing her dissertation on nurturing in the English novel . Lately , she has taken to eating only the food in Barbara Pym novels , and she is forever inviting me over for a nice cup of tea or a boiled egg on toast . " Do n't you think all this food is a little bland ? " I asked her the other night , over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the whole point , it 's nonthreatening . " My sister and I cling to each other , like survivors of an unbelievable , strange event , an event that we do n't have the words to describe . That event was our childhood . Our childhood was n't strange in the way other people 's were . We were n't abused or tortured or locked in a basement . We had parents who were successful and intelligent , but completely out of our reach . If we had a problem , they were the last people we would turn to . We see each other frequently , although sometimes the last person you need to see is someone who has gone through what you have . We are different from other people , lacking in certain qualities , overflowing in others . My sister and I were n't always close . There was a time when the five-year age difference between us was an enormous barrier . I used to look at her and see a distant emissary from the land of cool . In high school , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than anything . Later , we started to confide in each other . When I broke up with Charles , she was the only one I could talk to about it . Now , when I look at her , I see myself , but different . I know that if she is OK , then I could be . My sister is happy in her job . I 've never had a job I liked . When I started my current job as a legal secretary , there were all these procedures to rememberclient codes , computer codes , legal terminology . Now that I know what I 'm doing , I think my job is easy , my knowledge useless . This is what I believe : Everything I know how to do well is useless . Everything that I do n't know is impossible . My sister sits in an ivory tower eating baked beans on toast . She has even persuaded her distinguished university to add it to the menu . I imagine her growing thin on a diet of Jane Austen and George Eliot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she has had her one great love and all that kind of thing must be avoided from now on . She trusts novels not life . In novels , things work out according to plan ; in life the plot is entirely unmanageable . I want to shake my sister into action . I want her to fall in love . Hanging up the phone , I try to trace the origin of our dilemma . My sister and I grew up believing that our parents knew everything and everything they did n't know was irrelevant . They dismissed the ordinary as ridiculous , the spiritual as unnecessary . They were communists in their youth . They hid people , secret people . When we tried to pin them down , the stories evaporated . They would become impatient , changed the subject . When I heard about them hiding people , I imagined an underground railroad like the one we learned about in middle school , with trapdoors and trick panels and slaves singing freedom songs . In Westchester , having achieved tenure and membership in the heavily chlorinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonics every night and were your basic liberals . My mother is a professor at Columbia ; my father teaches group psychology at NYU . Of all the people I know , they are the most open-minded . The only thing they truly abhor is the ordinary . My parents met at a playground . They were young , athletic , Jewish and communist . They believed only in the rational . In a rather conventional series of events , they courted and got married . I know all this because I 've seen their wedding album , which I found on top of a pile of psychology books in the attic . It 's a sugary white photo album where they are young and beautiful , idealistic , and in love . There is a heart-shaped portrait of them gazing into each other 's eyes , another picture in the shape of a candle where they are cutting the cake . I am always mesmerized by the last picture . The picture is in the shape of a keyhole . My father has my mother in his arms and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a door . I would go over this picture in secret , tracing around the keyhole with my finger , and look at my mother 's white dress , in its tissue paper mausoleum . I tried to peer inside the keyhole , learn the secret that would make me understand these strange , powerful people , but they were always waving good-bye , shutting me out behind that closing door . During my childhood , I was convinced I was going mad . I heard noises in my head , mostly a high-pitched buzzing sound . When I was twenty , a doctor told me this was not uncommon , something to do with the bones developing in the inner ear , but at the time I was too worried about my sanity to tell anyone . My parents collected objects with strange faces , masks , gargoyles , African sculptures . Before I went to sleep , the gargoyle heads on the banister outside my room would make faces at me in the half-light . I could n't close my door because I was afraid of the dark but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me . I ca n't remember my childhood as a whole but I do remember specific incidents . I remember a snowy day in March when I was in second grade . My brother and sister were sitting around the kitchen table listening to the radio announce schools that were closed . I remember praying for mine , and my brother grinning evilly at me , with the knowledge that his school started a half hour later than mine did and I had to leave first . I asked my father , " Do I really have to go ? " knowing the answer , as I pulled on my green rubber boots and zipped up my parka with the fuzzy white hood . We were only allowed to stay home in three specific instances : if we threw up , had a fever , or the radio said our school was closed . Pulling on my mittens , I walked outside to the familiar path I took every day . Except that day , there was no path , only an endless blurry snowscape . At first , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in the snow , touching it to my tongue , watching my feet make deep impressions in the untouched surface . But the further I got down the hill , the more strange everything seemed to get . The woods were unnaturally quiet , quiet and unfamiliar . It was still snowing and I was starting to get cold . When I got down to the bottom of the hill , I did n't know which way to go . The snow was so deep I could n't distinguish any familiar landmarks . My house was out of sight and snow was seeping into my boots . The trees , which moments ago had looked magnificent and glittering , were now taking on a more threatening appearance ; their snow-colored limbs seemed to be trying to grab at me , and in the tree trunks , I saw the hideous grinning faces of gargoyles . I kept walking faster , feeling like I was going in circles . My mittens were wet , my hood was wet , and my feet were nearly soaked . At one point I tripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , but I knew I had to get up or I 'd end up frozen in the snow for eternity . Finally , I emerged out of the woods into a clearing and saw something familiar , a buildingKingsley Elementary School , my school . I was so happy I ran as fast as I could to the main door , longing for school as I never had before , but when I opened the heavy door , it was quiet except for the sound of my boots dripping on the floor . I was the only one stupid enough to come to school in the snow . I heard a shuffling noise from deep within the school and I ran outside , not waiting to see who or what it was . It had stopped snowing , so I could make out my footprints and I followed them back , as fast as I could , all the way up the hill to home . When I finally got back to the house , I opened the door and heard laughter . It was as if they had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate in the kitchen , all of them , my parents and my brother and sister , as if nothing had happened . My father was at the stove , taking a survey as to who wanted matzo brei and who wanted fried salami and eggs . " Well , liza , I guess you know the good news . It 's a snow day for all of us , " said my mother , standing at the stove . " Yeah , Kingsley came on the radio just after you left . " My brother looked smug . " You better get out of those wet clothes , " said my father . I refused the hot chocolate and all offers of food , as if denying myself would show them , and stomped up to my room , crying violently into my white parka . I barricaded the door with books and pillows but after a little while , I realized no one was going to come get me . Just then , a knock on the door startled me . It was my sister . She had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was still barricaded . " Liza , let me in . " " Okay , but just you . " She had brought me some hot chocolate . Unbarricading the door , I let her in . My therapist says my entire name when I enter the room , Eliza Ferber . I think it 's to make me feel like I exist . " Eliza Ferber , " she says , and I lie down on the couch , mesmerized . When she says my name I start to like my name , a name that I have always found strange . My sister 's name is Bette . Both of our names are diminutives of Elizabeth . It is as if we are the broken parts of one perfect Elizabeth . My sister had one relationship , one very long relationship , a marriage , that ended , so now she believes that this avenue of endeavors , relationships , is permanently closed to her . How can you do something you have failed at ? How can you try again ? These are the concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister she needs to meet someone . " A nerd , " I tell her over dinner that night at my favorite Italian restaurant , " or at least someone who was a nerd in high school and then blossomed later . They make the best boyfriends . They 're so grateful to have a girlfriend at all . " Gregor , who is sitting next to me , shakes his head . " No , I do n't think she should go for a nerd , she needs to play the field a little . " Gregor is my boyfriend . Actually his real name is Gregory , but he thinks Gregor is better for an actor , more unusual . We have been seeing each other for two years . He has blond curly hair and is n't my type at all . I used to go for all these tall , dark , foreign guys who never understood me . Gregor 's more like me , grew up in the suburbs , reads books , thinks about things . Things are fine between us , but whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My sister does n't like the idea of the nerd kind of guy either . I can tell by her expression , as she picks at her spaghetti bolognese , a food that all English people eat when they go abroad . If she ever did like anyone , I imagine it would be someone with an air of mystery , someone dangerous , someone with secrets . I compose a plan in my head of how I would meet someone if it came to that . I would take classes , exude an air of availability . But why would I have to ? I glare over at Gregor as if he has already done something that has forced me into this course of action . Or would it be better to give up on this idea of togetherness , this happily ever after , once and for all ? Why try to convince Bette of something I 'm not sure I believe in ? Maybe she is happier alone . She certainly looks happy , chatting with Gregor about desserts . She is describing a British dessert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dessert , the waiters bring out a miniature chocolate cake for me , lit with two tiny pink candles . I feel like crying . Do you think you would have your primary residence here or abroad ? " I ask my sister a few days later . I am at her apartment and we are playing one of our favorite games : if I won Lotto . She pauses from sniffing my small vial of peppermint oil , the latest in my series of attempts to lose ten pounds . " Definitely abroad , do you think this works ? " " Yes , smell is intimately connected with hunger . " My sister and I are watching a British show about a monk named Cadfael who cures people with herbs and solves mysteries . I take a small piece of pizza to see if the peppermint oil is working . " I would definitely live in Italy , Siena , in a small villa with dogs , " I say with authority , biting into my pizza . It tastes so good I almost forget my job problem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregor ? " asks my sister . " That is yet to be determined . " After we finish eating , my sister makes tea . She makes it carefully , using real tea , not tea bags , warming the pot , covering the whole thing with a tea cozy . Pouring out the Earl Grey into delicate china teacups , I continue with my Lotto scenario : " I would start the Eliza fund , scholarships for hopeless underachievers . " I walk the short block home to my apartment , picking up a rejection letter from a small poetry magazine called Output and various credit card bills . The only good mail I get is a belated birthday card from my friend Elinor , who , after a string of horrible relationships , has left New York to start over in Boston . Inside , I sink down on my maroon velvet couch I got at the Salvation Army . I look at the letter from Output more carefully . It 's a form letter . Thank you for submitting to Output , but your poem does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a traditional narrative structure . Editorial needs ? Narrative structure ? Who needs them anyway ! I think of calling Gregor , but he is at acting class . Lately , he is always at acting class when I want to talk to him . I am convinced he will be a huge success , although he has only recently quit his corporate job to pursue this new career . I , on the other hand , will end up a large failure , although I have been writing poetry for years , even had a few things published in obscure yet prestigious literary journals . I picture us at the Academy Awards , Gregor in a dazzling tuxedo , me in a figure-flattering black dress . We are spilling out of a limousine , or at least Gregor is spilling , or rather emerging from the limousine onto the arms of beautiful spokesmodels . I try to emerge gracefully from the limo but catch my high heel on a loose thread and tumble out to an ominous ripping sound . Luckily , the photographers have gone on ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is whisked away by thin women with cleavage . ( Continues ... )
