<p> MAYBE it 's because I was in New York a couple of weeks ago , but this looks like a bargain , " ventured my friend Jerry , scanning the lunch menu at Tony 's on a recent noon . He sounded at once startled and pleased . <p> " Bargain " and " Tony 's " are two words that never would have been used in the same sentence during the heyday of Tony Vallone 's restaurant on South Post Oak . <p> For decades that edition of Tony 's served as the unofficial canteen for Houston 's upper crust ( and those who aspired to it ) . Tony himself - pacing the floor , recalibrating his seating chart on the fly - reigned as high-strung ringmaster and status arbiter-in-chief . <p> Whether you were seated with the A-list in the sacred central aisle , cordoned off by room dividers or consigned to look on from the fringes , none of it came cheap . <p> Yet here we were , a year into the life of Tony 's latest brainchild at Greenway Plaza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid-teens . <p> And what about that three-course express lunch for 17 bucks ? It was n't a lot to ask for what turned out to be some of the very best food in the city . <p> The ravioloni di manzo , plumped up with shreddy short ribs and an unctuous , almost subliminal ooze of earthy fontina cheese , sat in a stirring sage-spiked glaze . It was one of those entrees you hope will never end . <p> A first-course special of itty-bitty frog legs materialized : savory lollipops pooled in a garlicked butter sauce as sheer as silk . <p> We dabbled in a citrus-gigged green salad , livened with sliced figs and crumbled blue cheese . <p> We fought over the last little circlets of agnolotti inverno , pasta rounds hiding spicy minced veal sharpened with Parmesan and given a broth-laced , barely creamy tomato sauce . <p> We marveled over the crisp , splayed edges of a baby artichoke that had been parboiled and sauted in olive oil , so that it emerged like a brittle , delicious flower with a soft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veal - pounded oh so thin - sparkled with a gloss of lemon butter and frizzly fried capers . <p> " Why , " I thought while spearing the last , tender bite , " would I bother to order veal anywhere else ? " <p> This , my fellow Houstonians , is the restaurant Tony Vallone was born to run . Now that he has sold off his popular Grotto and La Griglia , and closed down Anthony 's and an ill-fated Mexican venture , Tony is back to being a hands-on , singularly focused restaurateur . <p> It suits him . He 's trying for a younger , hipper crowd . He 's pricing to suit . The old jacket-and-tie dress code has gone out the window . Nothing is out of bounds , even a brief run at Sunday brunch , which has been discontinued . <p> But the bottom line is that the food at Tony 's , in the skillful hands of chef Olivier Ciesielski , has never been better . Ciesielski is beautifully trained , having worked in France for the late chef Bernard Loiseau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched a delightful bistro , L'Aventure , in the old Armando 's space on Shepherd Drive during the 1990s , but alas , it was ahead of its time . ) <p> Somehow these two exacting men have arrived at a communal food style that feels unique . The menu reflects Tony 's modern Italian aspirations , coupled with Ciesielski 's very French discipline - plus a few obligatory Asian touches - but the cuisine is very much of its place on the Gulf Coast . It is its own unusual self , and it works . <p> The art in the brave new contemporary dining room has taken a great leap forward in sophistication . Just take a gander at the glorious Rauschenberg painting gleaming like sunset , high over the main dining room , on its stainless-steel field . <p> A tall textured-stone grove sprouts in the middle of the room : " The Three Graces , " strong torsos commissioned from Texas sculptor Jess Moroles . At one fortunate table , you can actually dine among the sculpture 's roots , as if you were at the skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new restaurant announces that Tony has shed his old-fashioned days , right along with all the gaudy Impressionistic canvases and smoked glass that once bedizened the Post Oak restaurant . <p> Now the visitor passes through a curved wall sheened with falling water - a never-ending rainstorm - and is propelled willy-nilly into an abrupt , shallow space . <p> There , as often as not , is Tony 's wife , Donna Vallone - a warm , unintimidating brunette - to meet and greet , to size up ( gently ) and steer . Jeff Vallone , Tony 's son , prowls the floor as watchfully as his famously watchful dad . <p> Tony is very much on the scene : schmoozing regulars , imparting bits of observation and gossip , touting whatever latest and greatest ingredient he has been able to procure . <p> And procure he does . Those frog legs , for instance . Or a burrata , the obscenely creamy Pugliese mozzarella , that he and Ciesielski serve with dramatic simplicity - a snowy crown on a pile of perfect cubed tomatoes , ribboned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive oil . <p> Food does n't get much better or more elemental than this . <p> Things are pricier at night , when the room is more glamorous . And at dinner , it pays to follow the small printed list of specials . <p> A first course of crevettes - langoustinelike prawns , split and broiled with garlic butter - are as sweet and stunning as can be . Mussels Marechiaro , fat shellfish in an enticing white-wine-and-tomato broth , will satisfy people who miss the red-wine version that Tony served at Grotto . <p> Quite honestly , I have found it hard to go wrong here . <p> Full disclosure : For reviews , I dine anonymously when possible ; at Tony 's , I was recognized . In such cases the service can improve radically , and it did . The lumps of crabmeat ( a Tony obsession ) can swell ; the lamb chops can be selected with extra care . <p> What ca n't be changed or disguised is the bedrock quality of the cooking . And under the Vallone/Ciesielski regime , that quality seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seared halibut in a serious , counterintuitive Barolo sauce , the red wine an earthy counterpoint to the clean , fresh fish . <p> It is there in a piquant dish of roasted rabbit in a deft mustard sauce , its delicate bed of cabbage summoning up Alsace-Lorraine . <p> And who could resist the explosion of flavor that is the smoky Colorado lamb chops , with their escort of chewy , pancetta-flecked risotto ? Stunning stuff , as are any of the pastas . <p> One of my favorites is called Pasta Fantasia , envelopes filled with delicate butternut and acorn squash , then jumped up with snippets of seared foie gras in a buttery sauce . <p> Yikes . <p> Yikes , too , for the rare venison chop poised on a blissfully tart , winy blackberry sauce that wisely refuses to be sweet . The crisped fingerling potatoes alongside are just made for mopping the sauce . <p> The missteps have been few . I found the braised prime short ribs a little too salty for pleasure . The yummy green salads can be marginally overdressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for customizing food to suit his customers . <p> " What would you like ? " is not an empty refrain here . More than any restaurant in town , they mean it . <p> Does the foie gras appetizer sound too sweet for you , with its caramelized pineapple , dried cherries and port reduction ? OK , Ciesielski will have his troops concoct a version with a lilting green apple vinaigrette , anchored by a fan of thin , glazed Fuji and Gala apple slices . Perfect . <p> The menus change frequently , incrementally , seasonally , which keeps things interesting . So if the classic Tony 's high-and-mighty Grand Marnier souffl does n't suit , you might end up with the most elegant baked apple imaginable , drizzled with a fine ribbon of butterscotch . <p> The multitiered dessert cart , that old Tony 's signature , has been retired - for the better , I think . <p> The very with-it sommelier is Joe Pat Clayton , whose outrageously cool spectacles would suit him for a rockabilly band . The list may be all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against mainstream American and French labels , but on it lurk some refreshing surprises . <p> Talk to Clayton , who seems proudest of his discoveries at the lower end of the price range . By-the-glass finds include an edgy pinot grigio , a blooming Flora Springs sauvignon blanc and a suave , offbeat Hungarian Tokai that stands up to any foie gras . Excellent , reasonably priced bottle choices are a Penner-Ash Rubeo red blend ; a 2002 Minervois L'Ostal Cazes " La Livinire , " a Rhneish blend of syrah , mourvedre , grenache and carignan ; and a mineral-laden St. Aubin , a wonderful white burgundy at a good price . <p> I do wish the wine program would move toward more unexpected choices . There 's something to be said for educating and leading your clientele . This list is a start . <p> For all you social observers - I know you are out there - this incarnation of Tony 's feels way more democratic than the old one . Yes , there is a favored seating area , in front of and to either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room . That 's where folks like Greg and Patsy Fourticq are seated , or funeral grandee Bob Jones , with a big holiday party of guests wearing felt reindeer antlers . <p> But the seating hierarchy is much looser these days . David Saperstein may perch on a rear banquette while talking nonstop into his mobile phone . John Thrash , husband to the ubiquitous fashionista Becca Cason Thrash , may surface on the far side of the room . <p> Is there a Siberia ? Well , yes . There 's a wall that pulls out to close off a third of the dining room when bookings are not at 100 percent . Beyond that wall is the frozen social steppe . <p> But guess what ? The stratification is so subtle here , compared to the old Tony 's , that everyone seemed perfectly happy the night I saw the place filled to the gills . It all felt relatively democratic and everyone was eating exceedingly well . <p> Now , if they would just recruit a latter-day Bobby Short or Billy Stritch to hold forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head , " accompanied by a synth combo . Then Tony 's would be ready to inhabit its new reality fully . <p> FAST FACTS <p> " Tony 's : " 3755 Richmond <p> " Hours : " 11:30 a.m. -2 p.m . Mondays-Fridays ; 6-10 p.m .
