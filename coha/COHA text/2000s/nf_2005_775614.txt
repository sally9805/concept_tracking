Jackie // On a quiet midweek afternoon in early June 1997 , I received a phone call that almost destroyed my life . // " Is this Anne Grady ? " the caller asked . It was a man 's voice , unfamiliar . // " Who is this , please ? " // " My name is Don , " he said . " You do n't know me , but I 'm related to you . " // I immediately knew who he was . As an adopted child , this was the day I had been praying for , and dreading , my entire life . I was about to meet my biological family , and that family included three brothers I had n't even known existed . // One of those brothers was Scott Peterson . // At the time of that fate-changing call , I was working at Cubic Corporation , a defense contractor in San Diego . Cubic does a lot of work for the U.S. government , and my father , Tom Grady , was president of Cubic Videocomm , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late May , I had been living in San Francisco , but I had a job I did n't like , no boyfriend , and a landlord who suddenly decided to double my rent . // So I returned home to Point Loma , in San Diego , to stay for a while with my parents , the people who adopted me at birth . I was adopted in 1965 , when I was just a few days old ; my brother Stephen was adopted three years later . My mother had been diagnosed with cancer , and she 'd been told it was unlikely she 'd ever have children , but five years after Stephen came along she became pregnant with her first child , Susan , and three years after that she gave birth to a son , Michael . // We lived in San Diego until I was twelve . Our parents loved all four of us equally . They had led a charmed life long before we came along . My father got his BA at Berkeley and his MBA from Harvard . After he graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego . My mother , Jerri , was a teacher in landlocked Galesburg , Illinois , but she had a yen for the Pacific . One day she was talking to recruiters about teaching jobs out west , and when they mentioned San Diego she jumped at the chance . It was a good job , and San Diego was a navy base ; she thought she might meet a man in uniform . As it turned out , she was right . One sunny afternoon not long after she settled in Mission Beach , she saw a tall , tanned , handsome man strolling past with a surfboard under his arm . He was exactly the kind of man she had hoped to meet , so she had the good sense to invite him to dinner . They were married in 1960. // Not long afterward , she was diagnosed with Hodgkin 's disease . They got through it , however , and they even found a way to deal with the news that they might never have children of their own . // " You can adopt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " my father asked . // " I think I may know someone , " the doctor replied . // He did know someone . He had a patient called Jackie Latham . She was unmarried and pregnant for the second time , and once again she did n't feel capable of caring for the child . The doctor told her about my parents ' desire to adopt , and Jackie was tempted because the doctor described them as terrific , salt-of-the-earth type of people . When she heard about my mother 's illness , she nearly changed her mind . She did n't want to give her little girl to someone who might not be around to care for her . But my father sent word back through the doctor that , if anything happened to Jerri , he was both willing and able to care for me by himself . Reassured , Jackie handed me over . // When I was six years old , my parents told me I was adopted . They explained that my mother , a nice lady , had felt ill equipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl just like me , and that they felt very lucky to have found me . I was n't sure I understood what they meant , but I was n't at all troubled by it . As far as I was concerned , they were my parents and always would be . // I never felt strange , different from , or less loved than other children , and I remember only one occasion where my history had any impact on me . I was in second grade at the time , and the class had been festooned with flags from many countries . We were told to stand under the flag of the country of our ancestors , and of course I had no idea where to go . When I noticed a large crowd under the British flag , I just joined in , and no one objected . There was safety in numbers . // When I went home I told my parents what had happened and asked them if they knew anything about my ancestry . " Well , " my father said , " from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English on her mother 's side and some German on her father 's side . " // " So did I stand in the right place ? " // " You sure did , " my mother said . // My parents are very grounded people . They have been married for almost forty-five years and have lived in the same house for nearly all that time . They seldom argue , they love to travel , and they 're still friends with most of the people they knew when they were first married . In short , they are solid , reliable , and steady , and I can talk to them about anything . // I had a comfortable childhood , which bordered on privileged . We went on many vacations . We took road trips all up and down California - the beaches , the deserts , and the mountains - and often traveled to Mexico . We also went to Berkeley from time to time , to visit my paternal grandparents , and we loved to visit San Francisco . We also loved visiting my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
