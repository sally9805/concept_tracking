Identical <p> It was the late spring of 1983 , and I was a pee pot . <p> I was addicted to peeing in the bed . <p> I did it every night , without fail . <p> I would wake up midstream , but by then it was already too late . The deed was done , and I would lie there , shivering . <p> Not again . <p> Why could n't I wake up before I peed ? <p> Was that too much to ask ? <p> Pee . <p> Pee . <p> And more pee . <p> The sheets would fill to capacity with the strong , pungent liquid spilling warmth from my bottom , which quickly turned cold , but that was n't the bad part , just the unpleasant element . The bad part was that the acid of the pee had eaten through the flimsy mattress of the top bunk , burning a hole straight through it . Literally , it ate it right up . When I took off the sheet , the springs were exposed , and gigantic brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This was especially bad news for my identical twin , Aerial , because we slept in bunk beds . I had the top bunk , and she had the bottom . Every time I peed in the bed , it would leak through the springs and drip on her face . This happened so much that I would tease Aerial and call her a pee-pee face . <p> I offered on more than one occasion to switch bunks with her , but she refused each time , stating as the basis for her refusal , " The top bunk stinks-smells just like pee ! " <p> " So does the bottom bunk , " I reminded her . " It 's seen just as much pee as the top bunk . " <p> " Yeah , right ! " she snapped with a twisted expression . <p> Aerial was a beautiful girl , but when she poked out her lips and rolled her eyes into the back of her head like that , those good looks flew straight out the window . <p> " That face you make ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And neither is bed-wetting , " she 'd always remind me . <p> In infancy , bed-wetting was an acceptable form of self-expression , but once I grew out of diapers , it was n't cute anymore . It 's just not a cool thing to do when you 're in the sixth grade . <p> I went to sleep dry . <p> Woke up wet . <p> Every night . <p> No exceptions . <p> Dry . <p> Wet . <p> Dry . <p> By the way , I should probably tell you my name , since you already know some pretty embarrassing stuff about me . <p> My name is Blaze LeDoux James . I am eleven years old , but I am a long way from being average . I am gifted by way of intelligence . Now , nobody has officially confirmed my " gift " of being unusually smart for my age , so you may ask the question , " Who said I was gifted ? " <p> I said it . <p> And why did I say it ? ' Cause in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that end up being true . We are self-created . Now you can see firsthand why I call myself gifted . <p> I live in Shreveport , Louisiana , across the street from a garbage dump . Truth is , my whole block stinks to high heaven , not just my bunk bed . <p> We live at 216 Turnpike Street in " economy housing , " or something like that . It just means the houses are darned near free , because our backyard and front-yard views are of city trash . It seems like the house is almost turned around sideways on the street . Rent is real cheap , ' cause we live behind the railroad tracks , and every hour the walls shake from the railcar passing through . <p> All of the houses on this street are small , run-down shacks , and the neighbors are shady-not because they 're covered by trees but because they do crooked things . <p> Our next-door neighbor calls himself " Reverend Mike , " but he ai n't no more a preacher than you or me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone who wants to get a good deal for cheap . But the only thing I say is buyer beware . It has been rumored on the street that Reverend Mike 's jewelry turns both the skin and the teeth pea green . Not very attractive at all . <p> Four doors down from our dump and directly across the street lives Miss Felicity Hardaway . Rumor has it she 's the best barber in all of Shreveport , Louisiana . She owns her own little barbershop close to downtown called Cutting Up . It 's always packed , because not only is Miss Felicity really good , but also the fellows are partial to her good looks . <p> According to the little perverted neighborhood boys , they use a term called stacked to describe her ' cause of the way her body is built . Miss Felicity 's breasts and hips are extra large , and the boys go nuts for her . She 's always prancing around half-naked in the neighborhood , wearing these itsy-bitsy booty shorts , smacking gum and smoking one cigarette after the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we can always hear her telephone conversations , which are mostly cackling laughter , because the sound trickles out of her living room and down the driveway , spilling out into the street . <p> I oftentimes find myself staring out of the big picture window that sits in our living room , waiting on Miss Felicity to come home . There 's something downright mesmerizing about her that brings me here . <p> " Why you always staring at that woman ? " Aerial would ask . <p> " ' Cause she 's different , " I 'd say . <p> " You do n't even know her , " Aerial would insist . <p> " Yeah , " I 'd agree , " but I 'd like to . " <p> " You think you might like to be fast like that when you grow up ? " she 'd ask me . And I would look at her and roll my eyes , and stick out my tongue at her . <p> Miss Felicity Hardaway is well-known in the neighborhood because she 's good for blasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the fellows overlook it , ' cause most of them have crushes on her . The women in the neighborhood are good and sick of Miss Felicity . Good and sick . Mama is not a big fan either ; she 's never said anything bad about Miss Hardaway , but we can just tell she does n't like her . Maybe ' cause our daddy , Mr. Rufus , is always trying to sneak a peek out the window when Mama ai n't looking , but that 's impossible , ' cause Mama 's always looking . <p> Always . <p> " What you think she 's like ? " I asked Aerial every afternoon when we 'd pass Miss Felicity 's house on the way home from school . <p> " Seems something like a movie star to me , " she would always say . <p> " You think she 's prettier than Mama ? " I would ask . <p> " No way , " said Aerial . <p> " I do sometimes ... " <p> " Bite your tongue , Blaze James , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama . " <p> " You think she 's crooked ? " I 'd ask . <p> " Everybody on this block is crooked , " Aerial would say . And because of that , everybody on the block owned a gun ; people here do n't respect private property . <p> They 'll knock on your door in the middle of a bold afternoon , pull out a cheap handgun , and kindly scoot you over to the side while they help themselves to everything from a cup of sugar in the kitchen to your television set in the bedroom . <p> I 've seen three robberies in broad daylight with my own eyes . It did n't faze me much , but Aerial always freaked out . Both were commonplace in my neighborhood-the theft and Aerial 's oversensitivity to life . <p> I did n't take too much seriously and was able to shake off a lot , but Aerial did n't seem to have that ability . It appeared to me that she was a bleeding heart to everybody 's cause . She was the sensitive one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was always trying to bring home stray animals and feed homeless people , oftentimes giving her own lunch away on the way to school each day . <p> " Why do you always give your lunch away ? " I 'd ask her . <p> " They 're hungry , Blaze . " <p> " Well , " I said , " how hungry you gon na be without lunch ? " <p> " I 'll be just fine , " she 'd affirm . <p> And , of course , she would be just fine , because I 'd always end up sharing half of my lunch with her , and she would eat it with a smile , look into my eyes , and ask , " Does n't it make you feel good , Blaze ? Helping the homeless ? " <p> " No , " I 'd say , pouting as we sat beneath the same sap tree on the school playground sharing my measly lunch each day . " What would make me feel good is having the other half of my lunch ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you feel good helping ? " she 'd ask . <p> " No ! " <p> " Yes , you do ! " <p> " No , I do n't ! " <p> " Yes , you do , " she 'd keep saying until I made this pitiful expression , and she would look at my dramatic face and burst into laughter . She would laugh so hard , I could n't help but eventually break down and laugh , too , even though I was mad about splitting my lunch straight down the middle . <p> Still I would laugh . <p> I laughed because maybe it was funny . <p> Aerial 's laughter was contagious , and it would sneak up from behind and catch hold of me . <p> It was real like that . <p> Tangible-like . <p> " Stop making me laugh ! " I would command her . " Stop it ! " <p> " You know you love helping the homeless , " she would tease , tickling me . <p> " Do not ! " <p> " Do too ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd say to me . <p> " What stuff ? " I would ask . <p> " Your stuff . " <p> " Well , what stuff is that ? " I 'd insist on knowing . <p> " Just stuff , " she would always insist back . <p> " I never know what you 're talking about , " I told her . " You 're always talking in code . This stuff . That stuff . " <p> " It 's not this stuff or that stuff , " she 'd insist . " It 's your stuff . " <p> Whatever . <p> Our sibling bickering always ended with the same grand finale-Aerial 's smile . It was " the smile of life , " a river of gold and to see it was to be in awe of God itself . <p> Aerial and I were identical in appearance , identical beyond telling each other apart , both wearing the same beautiful shade of brown , both with long , flowing hair as thick as horse manes , both with the faces of Gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really pretty girls . <p> God made us perfect . <p> Strangers knew it . Our parents knew it . Even blind people could tell we were pretty . Somehow , they could sense it . And we knew it , too , and every time we looked at each other , we really did see ourselves . <p> On a deeper level , I was the one with the regular smile , an everyday kind of smile . It was beautiful , but it was n't magical . And if you looked at both of us at the same time , honest to God you could n't tell us apart till you looked at the smile ; then it became obvious who was the truly beautiful one . <p> Like I said , we were both really pretty ... but Aerial ... Aerial was a different kind of pretty . I knew it , but it was no big deal , because most people got caught up in the stupid stuff , like our skin and our hair , or maybe they got stuck on the fact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense to look past all that could always see us and tell us apart . <p> Always . <p> Aerial had something I could n't touch . She had a shine that could not be duplicated , even by me , her twin . <p> Her soul passed mine up . <p> Way up . <p> I do n't know how to explain it any better than that , and never in a million years would the average person know the truth that I accepted the moment we joined souls in twin-hood : Aerial would always outshine me . <p> Always . <p> And I was okay with that . <p> I knew it . <p> And she knew it . <p> It was an agreement we made at birth . <p> She would shine and I would bask in the glow of her reflection . I would be the real smart one , and she would be the real magical one . <p> That was our deal . <p> I ca n't convey it in bigger words than that . It pretty much says everything on its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Aerial , Aerial , Aerial , would be the one to shine . <p> Chapter Two " What Makes You Special ? " <p> Mr. Rufus and Aliyah James were the two grown people who lived in our house and paid stuff like rent and bought stuff like food . We had the same last name and even shared similar facial features and expressions . Actually , we were the children of our mother and saw very little evidence of any relations to the notorious drunk Rufus James , who stated his paternal claim so boldly on our birth certificates . <p> In short , our mother was a high school beauty queen who traded in her crown in the twelfth grade for motherhood and two shifts as a waitress at the local dump ... I mean diner . <p> Rufus was ten years her senior , a tenth-grade dropout and kind of on the lazy side . A wanderer of the neighborhood , he worked odd jobs here and there , maybe . He knew everybody , but nobody really knew him , including us , the identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time , Aerial and I would see ourselves in them , but it was fast and fleeting , the view . <p> Most of the time , we watched from the sidelines in awe of their stupidity . Stupid may not sound like a nice word , but for the life of me , I do n't know what else to call it . <p> That 's how they behaved most days . <p> In your language , Rufus and Aliyah would be what is termed parents . But we only called them that for lack of a more suitable noun , because in our twin language we often referred to them as nincompoops . <p> " Do you think the nincompoops are home yet ? " I would ask Aerial each day as we walked home from school . <p> " God , I hope not , " she would respond . <p> Sigh . <p> Sigh . <p> She did n't want them there , because wherever they were , chaos would follow . <p> Drama . <p> Tension . <p> Arguing . <p> You name it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Maybe it was because Rufus drank hard liquor as if it were grape Kool-Aid . And when he actually did go to work , he did so for a factory across the river . He was a fill-in janitor . When the regular cleanup crew was out , Rufus would fill in . Or better yet , " fill up , " because he hated work but loved the booze and the women . At least that 's what the walls whispered in the late-night hours . Actually , the walls do n't whisper at all ; they kinda shout , scream , and cry at 2:00 A.M. when nobody 's looking-but they 're always listening . <p> " Word is you and Etta got something going ! " Mama would yell . <p> " Who 's Etta ? " Rufus would slur . <p> " Etta 's the tramp you been seeing behind my back ! " <p> " I do n't know no Etta ! " he 'd insist . <p> " Etta sure knows you , " Mama would accuse . <p> " Who knows me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who 's Etta ? " Rufus would ask again . <p> " The tramp you seeing behind my back ! " <p> " I do n't know no Etta , heifer ! " <p> " Well , Etta sure knows you ... " <p> And back and forth it would go like a bad comedy or a song gone way wrong . It was like a dying dog that you prayed somebody would put down so the rest of the litter could sleep . <p> " Sweet God in heaven , I wish the nincompoops would go to sleep ! " Aerial would declare , forcing a pillow over her head to drown out the background noise of their ignorance . <p> Sleep was wishful thinking . <p> Sleep was something that white kids with real daddies got on school nights-not broke , disadvantaged black kids who lived across from city dumps with drunk pappies who filled up on cube steak and Jim Beam . <p> Sleep ? <p> What was that ? <p> " You do n't love me , " Mama would whine . " Do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Rufus James ? You love me ? " <p> Silence . <p> " Goddammit , " she 'd scream . " Do n't you love me ? I work two jobs to take care of you , and I gave you two kids out of my own body ! " <p> " And ? " he 'd respond , like what she was talking about was n't a big , huge deal . <p> " And do n't you love me for it , Rufus James ? Do n't you love me for it ? " And this is where he would bust up laughing . It was always right here that Crazy Rufus would laugh on cue . <p> " Why you so special ? " he 'd ask Mama . " Why you think you so doggone special ? " Now , funny thing is , she never had an answer , except to say , " I work two shifts at my job and had two kids out of my own body for you . " <p> " So what ? " he 'd say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit out two kids at one time for you , " she 'd say with a righteous twang in her Southern drawl . " And they look just like each other . " <p> " Yeah , " Rufus would say . " They so busy looking like each other , they ai n't got time to look like me . I 'm supposed to be the daddy .... " <p> " Where I 'm from , two kids born at one time that look just like each other is called a miracle , ' cause it do n't happen that much , " Mama would boast . <p> " Where I 'm from , two kids born at one time is called a burden , ' cause they eat you out of house and home ! " Rufus would bark . <p> " Ai n't no more expensive than your old liquor and bad gambling debts , " Mama 'd say . <p> " It do n't matter , no mind , " Rufus would say . " You still ai n't said nothing about why you supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always went dead . <p> Dead air . <p> Mama went silent like somebody had yanked out her vocal cords or something . Truth is , sometimes I wanted to knock on the door and say , " Big whoop-de-do ... ca n't you come up with a better answer than that ? " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
