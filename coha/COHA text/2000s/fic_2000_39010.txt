The author of this story had other plans for me . In his , alas , typical ignorance and ineptitude , he decided to use me ( one more time ! ) as the heavy , a really bad guy in a bleak and downbeat story that most likely would gross you out or , in any case , would sure enough give you the willies , as they say , troubled about the essential nature of humankind as represented , exemplified by me , an antihero if there ever was one . <p> You probably do n't know me from Adam or Adam 's rottweiler . And I ca n't blame you for that . How would you know me , and why would you ? I ask you ! I do n't intend to bother you , to cover the whole thing . All you really need to know at this point is that I am precisely what I seem to be ( how many of you can make that claim ? ) -a fictional character , another imaginary person who usually ends up doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aforesaid character ( usually no more substantial or dimensional than a shadow ) wants him or her to be . <p> There are , of course , many disadvantages to life ( and death ) as a fictional character . I could go on and on about the subject and soon generate overwhelming ennui all around . But you can easily imagine most of the pains and problems and disappointments . Not least of which is the almost complete absence of free will . Whether I am willing to admit it or not , most of the time I have to be what my author wants . More to the point I have to be and to do what he wants even when it challenges common credibility and violates the sacred and sanctified rules and guiding principles of literary criticism . Which means ( think about it ; go figure ) I not only ca n't save myself , but also I ca n't come to his aid , either . I end up having to take the blame , together with my author , for whatever he makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair . And note the irony of it : I am composed , in fact and in any fiction I find myself involved in , of the figments and fragments of his conscious and unconscious obsessions . He may well think that he is freer than I am . If so , that is purely and simply a delusion . <p> It would be funny if it were n't so damn personal . <p> I said chances are you have never heard of me . Fine , I never heard of you , either . ( In a culture firmly based on celebrity , that puts us both at a distinct disadvantage . ) I never claimed to be a Captain Ahab or a Huck Finn , not Bech or Rabbit Angstrom or Zuckerman , either . My name is John Towne , and I have " starred " as the ( pardon the expression ) protagonist in maybe half a dozen short stories as well as in the widely reviewed and yet little-known novel Poison Pen . Most of the people who reviewed that book found something or other nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever , spoke or speak well or kindly and gently of me . The New York Times Book Review called me " a low-life crank " ; " a lecherous , misanthropic failed academic , " opined The Chicago Tribune ; someone writing for The Village Voice called me " an exceptionally sleazy picaro . ' And on and on in that vein . Probably the strongest and meanest judgment ( it would be slander if I were real ) appeared in The Greensboro News in a review by Fred Chappell , who identified me as " a loathsome , racist , sexist , crude , and gruesome creep . <p> Meanwhile the author who invented me was being described in other terms . Here is how The New York Times Book Review elected to characterize him : " He is a well-respected writer with a prestigious academic position-he 's Henry Hoyns Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Virginia : ' <p> Bully for him ! Pushing seventy , he makes about as much as a junior corporate executive fresh out of college . <p> Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story ? He planned to put me back into an academic setting and context ( where I have done hard time before- " an academic gypsy and con man , ' The Roanoke Times named me ) so that I could be poorer than he is . He planned to involve me and expose me in a singularly repellant story . It tells how I set out to seduce and betray the wife of a friend and colleague of mine , a poor old guy who is suffering from Alzheimer 's . My motivation , such as it was ( my author not planning to go too deep into the subtleties of motivation ) , at least at the outset , revenge . I want to hurt him because I did not get the promotion ( and tenure ) that I talked myself into believing that I richly deserved , even though I had not done anything to earn it and even though he , alone , among the entire senior faculty , had always been generous and friendly to me and was probably the only member of the whole frigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would have spoken up for me if he had n't already been diagnosed with Alzheimer 's . <p> In the story , according to the author , he , this suffering and slowly dying professor , was the scapegoat I invented . None of the others was particularly vulnerable , and , anyway , they would n't let me close enough to do them any harm . <p> Another motivation the author laid on me was that the wife in question was really good-looking . Extraordinary . Exceptionally attractive . I was to observe and/or remark , somewhere in the story , that except for her golden hair she was a first-rate knockoff of Cindy Crawford . ( That would serve to characterize me as a guy who took popular culture a little too seriously , at face value . Which , in fact , is true . ) This second motivation , lust , would tend to add to the ambiguity of my situation : that I was using the payback motive to disguise the simpler truth from myself and to justify my strong urge to try to seduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less vulnerable . <p> Another reason that the author planned to motivate me by sexual desire was that he had used this same thing , in other stories and in Poison Pen , to explain away my actions . Problem is , this kind of evidence is inadmissible and irrelevant . What I may have done or left undone in the context of another story has no bearing on this one . <p> What was supposed to happen here was that I would gently insinuate myself into her good graces by helping them in any and all ways that I possibly could-running errands for her , taking care of minor tasks and chores , and baby-sitting the old fart for a few hours while she went off , like a good creative faculty wife , to paint pictures or write poems or throw pots or whatever . <p> In the story the seduction turns out to be a whole lot easier than it probably would be-for you or for me or for anyone else-in real life . Pretty soon I am regularly having fun and games with her anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , in their bedroom . I mean , he has reached the point where he ca n't remember from one minute to the next ; so what do we care if he should walk in on us ? And it is all great and wonderful , and I find myself enjoying every minute of it . The author adds some complexity to my motivation by asserting that , in part , I am also getting even with all the beautiful women who have turned me down and/or spurned my amorous advances in a lifetime spent trying to score . Well , he is way off base there . By and large I have never had any problem making out with women , plain or fancy . I like women a lot , and most of the time I know how to get along with them . And that important and undeniable fact does not come across in the story . Let the author say whatever he pleases . My overall record speaks for itself . <p> What happens to me in the story , as the author sees it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman . I do n't mean to , of course ( whoever does ? ) , but I ca n't help myself , and I do so , anyway . And then because I have begun to care for her , I also begin to feel profoundly guilty . Meanwhile , though I am not aware of it yet , she also is tormented with guilt . So there you are with the three of us-the two guilt-ridden lovers and the old guy who has passed beyond all that kind of pain and trouble . <p> Now , then . You know , and I know , and I suspect even my author does , that most of the time guilt leads nowhere else but to a lot of deeper trouble . When we are feeling really guilty , we quickly discover that we are unable to forgive ourselves . So our first thought is always to unload that guilt onto somebody else , anybody who happens to be handy . As far as I can tell , guilt ( not shame , mind you , or sorrow ) does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular story that we are talking about , there is a big scene , apres some very good and memorable afternoon sex , during which we each try to assuage our guilt with false confessions . I intend to tell the truth , but only a part of it . I do n't tell her that I have come to love her . I tell her that the whole thing was just about getting even with her husband and that now that I have done just that , I feel wonderful . <p> Fighting back with fury . she says the whole thing is truly funny . Because , you see , she never really loved her husband or cared about him one way or another while he was still well and wideawake . She wanted comfort and security , and she got just that . But when he became ill , she cared for him out of guilt . All the time she was ready , willing , and able to be seduced by anybody , the first man who came along . Which happened to be me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a joke on both of us , she would say , ha-ha . I was not to be allowed to take any pride or pleasure in my seduction of her . And all of my guilt , real or imaginary , was utterly without meaning or implication . <p> On the way out of the house ( why am I described as tiptoeing , for Christ 's sake ? ) I decide to steal something valuable from him . My first thought is his real nice , expensive wristwatch . I could take it right off his arm if I wanted to , and he would never know the difference . But then , instead , the souvenir I take is his Mont Blanc fountain pen , resting on his dusty desk . I mean , why not ? He wo n't be writing anything with it , anyway . <p> Then the way the story ends is that , even before the academic year is over and done with , the old guy dies . His young wife ( did I fail to mention that fact-young ? Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemetery . The only plots left available are down at the far end close-by the railroad tracks . Well , at least he can listen to the whistle and rattle of freight trains coming and going . Eternity could be a lot worse . <p> After the funeral she packs up and takes off . I like to think she has gone to Southern California or Florida or maybe the Gulf Coast . Maybe Mexico . Someplace warm , anyway , where she can stretch out on a beach blanket and show off her incredible figure and pick up or ignore any old geezer she wants to . <p> I like to think that she sometimes thinks of me . <p> I am portrayed as thinking these things because I am busy packing up my own stuff to move on to the only job I have been able to get-at a college in miserable upstate New York , Joyce Carol Oates territory , Frederick Busch turf . I will freeze my ass off up there where it stays dark more than half the time . <p> The reader will think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lines the reader will also think that this story , in the form of a confession , is presumed to have been written with my newly acquired Mont Blanc pen . Here , at the tag end , I am shown wondering whether or not I will ever write her a letter and what I will find to say in it , assuming I can find out where she has gone . <p> Even though the author insists he is going through a " dark " period and ca n't help himself , I find this story to be too downbeat . I would much rather not be caught up in something so ugly and offensive and heavy-handed . Of course , it is only a slight variation on the familiar and conventional plot in which somebody sets out-on a bet or an impulse , out of anger or frustration or boredom-to seduce somebody else and , either in success or failure , falls in love . The odd little moral of such tales , usually , is the commonplace truth that sometimes there are good consequences of bad actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us know that much . <p> Admittedly we have only had time to deal with the general story line here . As my author would be the first to point out , we have neglected to consider the texture and the details , the little things he likes to do that , ideally , add up . Like , for example , plotting the pen very early in the story in a brisk , almost casual description of the professor 's desk and study . I would notice and admire the pen , among other valuable things , that 's all . But it would seem like an old friend when I suddenly decide to steal it . And I have to admit he does a nice little thing with her beautiful blond hair , touched and glowing in the late afternoon sun , on the blue pillowcase just before he ( 1 ) offers up his confession . <p> Now I would n't say that my author is completely without any talent . Imagine how that would be for the poor , helpless ( pardon ) protagonist , prisoner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of those out there . And so it is that even if we are not dealing with an Updike or a Roth or any such , I can nevertheless count my blessings . It can always be a whole lot worse , believe me . <p> One of the great flaws of the story , as the author wrote it , disregarding my advice , is that he does n't spend much time or detail on the professor . The story would have more meaning and impact if we had some special sympathy for the old guy . There was a brief scene , later cut during revision , in which we see the professor , with my help and the help of his wife , get dressed to go and teach a class . Which , of course , he ca n't do , anyway . But there is this little game of getting him ready to go forth into the world and to do something . Only by the time he 's ready to go , he has forgotten what it is he was planning to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the old guy had wonderful clothes and that he looked good in them . We get him dressed ; he admires himself in the mirror ; and then he wanders around the house , upstairs and down , basement and attic , without rhyme or reason , vaguely wondering what is happening to him . But the author chickened out of that scene . <p> I could be disloyal and tell you a thing or two about the author , things he would just as soon you did n't know , now and forever . But what good would that do me ? Seriously , that is the first and foremost question that you have to ask of anybody , especially including fictional characters . What is in it for him/her ? From the school of experience I can tell you that people , human beings , do n't do anything either good or evil , without there being something-pride , pleasure , vanity , self-esteem-in it for themselves . Even the purest forms of altruism and sacrifice are tainted . ( Know what I mean ? ) Love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odd and unexpected occasion when the lives and the circuitry of the desires of two people ( briefly , briefly ) come together and share the same frequency or wavelength . Or else , like happiness , love can be defined as the state of being well-deceived . <p> What I really hate , though , is being made the public scapegoat for the author 's guilt . He heaps troubles on my head in hopes of hiding the grubby truth about himself . You can bet your sweet ass he has done plenty of things ( thought , word , and deed ) that he ought to be sorry for . <p> In the various and sundry fictions I have lived in and through , I have been allowed to be happy a few times . And I was even happy at times in this otherwise unhappy story up until , but including , that afternoon . Her beautiful blond hair splashed on the blue pillow . Dust motes dancing in sunlight , the sweet smell and the smooth touch of her . Taste of her still on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice as she came to curse my name . And myself , ageless and weightless , floating in time as if in flowing water , for once fully satisfied and , for that moment , feeling free . Free at last to tell the truth , to confess all and maybe be forgiven . Which turned out to be exactly what the author had planned for me all along . <p>
