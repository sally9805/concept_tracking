Were you able to fix it ? " someone asks . My head snaps to the right . A man in a fur hat and red ski parka pauses before answering . That 's it , I think . There 's some mechanical problem with the plane . My mind races ahead , spinning out of control . I hate 737s . They have bad rudders , right ? Maybe there 's another flight home . Or even better , I could take the train ... <P> Fur hat finally answers , " Yup . Just the wheel , " as he points to his carry-on suitcase . <P> Classic . My mind had leaped in the space of a nanosecond from a waiting room in Logan Airport to a death spiral over the Atlantic . Dr. Curtis Hsia of Boston University 's Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders calls this automatic thinking . It was even worse a few hours earlier when , as part of my treatment for a debilitating case of aviophobia ( fear of flying ) , Dr. Hsia had booked me on Exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a virtual airplane of hardware , software and fancy head-mounted display screens that feels like the real thing . <P> I hate window seats , I remember thinking just before my virtual flight took off . You can see how far you 'd fall if ... Oops . Do n't go there . I want to speak to the crew for reassurance , but there is no one . Instead I 'm squeezed into a row of four seats , alone . <P> I take a hurried glance out the window to check the weather . Just a few stratus clouds . That 's O.K. The sound of jet engines drowns me as my virtual airplane heads down the runway . My legs are stiff , and I arch my back in anticipation . No g-force in this simulation . A small break for me . We level off . Sky is still good . I begin to relax . Look around . Not so bad . <P> A humongous noise sparks my body upward . Another glance out the window . Not good . We 're in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking . I can feel the thunder in my bones . I know this is n't real , but I ca n't seem to control my fear . Through the din , I hear Dr. Hsia ask me how I 'm feeling on an anxiety scale of 1 to 10 : total relaxation to panic . I 'm pushing 9 . The storm thunders on . I am hating this . <P> " Why is n't the pilot saying anything ? " I ask Dr. Hsia . I crave reassurance . The pilot must be fighting to stay aloft , I think . Maybe he 's drunk . <P> " What about the co-pilot ? " Dr. Hsia asks . <P> He 's probably drunk too . Otherwise someone would be saying something to reassure me . <P> " What 's the likelihood that both pilots would be out of it ? " he asks . <P> Probably nil , I answer reluctantly . All right . They got bad weather information . I start looking around the cabin , searching the seams of the fuselage for any signs of strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosened panel . Dripping water . A broken bolt . Still no word from the crew . I 'm getting ticked . They should be talking to me . My head is pounding . I 'm fingering my necklace . My legs ache . <P> It 's over . The sky is clear again . I get my breath back . My back is just sinking into the seat when  --  Gotcha ! We 're in another storm . Just as bad . Panic level back up to 9 . Still no pilot . Damn him ! Does this plane have a lightning rod ? My head is bursting now . <P> " What do you think would happen if lightning did hit the plane ? " Dr. Hsia asks . I do n't know . It would break apart . " Has that happened before ? " Not that I know of . " If the pilots are flying through this , it 's because they know the plane can take it , " he says calmly .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
