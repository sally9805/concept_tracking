A Job for a Ranger Louis L'Amour While the only true series Louis L'Amour wrote in novel form was his tales of the Sackett family , he did write a series of short stories that featured Texas Ranger Chick Bowdrie . Some of the stories were published in a collection called Bowdrie . Most of them were written between 1940 and 1947 and appeared in the magazine Popular Western . The one I 've chosen for this anthology shows Bowdrie acting not only as a Ranger , but as a detective as well . There were two bullet holes in the bank window , and there was blood on the hitching rail where the cashier had fallen while trying to get off a last shot . Lem Pullitt had died there by the rail , but not before telling how he had been shot while his hands were up . Chick Bowdrie stood on the boardwalk , his dark , Apache-like features showing no expression . " I do n't like it , " he muttered . " Either the holdup man was a cold-blooded killer or somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , his eyes searching the buildings , the walks , the horses tied at the rails . Many men kill , but killing a game man when his hands were up ... it just was n't the way things were done in Texas . And Lem had been game or he would not havestumbled out there , dying , trying for a shot . The bandits had come into town in two groups . One man with a rifle dismounted in front of the Rancher 's Rest while the others rode on to the bank . One then remained outside with the horses , and three had gone inside . When shots sounded from inside the bank , men rushed to the street ; then the man with the rifle opened fire . He covered the retreat of the four men at the bank , but what had become of the man with the rifle ? He had not run the gauntlet in the street . Henry Plank , clerk in the stage station , had stepped to the door and opened fire on the fleeing bandits . He claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat back on his head and studied the street , scowling . A large man with a blond mustache emerged from the bank and walked over to where Bowdrie stood . His face was florid and he wore a wide , dusty Stetson . " Are you the Ranger ? " Bowdrie turned his black eyes on the man , who felt a sudden shiver go through him . There was something in those eyes that made him feel uncomfortable . " Name of Bowdrie . Chick , they call me . You 're Bates ? " " Yes . They call me Big Jim . I am the banker . Or maybe I should say , I was the banker . " " Is it that bad ? " Bowdrie 's eyes strayed up the street . That was the direction from which the bandits had come . They could not have been seen until they were right in the street , and when they left , it was in the opposite direction , which put them behind some cottonwoods within a minute or two . On the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livery stable , a general store , and a blacksmith shop . At the opposite end , standing out a little from the other buildings , was the Rancher 's Rest . Across from the Rest were a corral , two houses , a dance hall , now closed , and the Chuck Wagon , a combination saloon and eating house . Directly across was the stage station . " Yeah , " Big Jim said , " it is that bad . I 've got money out on loans . Too darned much . None of the loans are due now . A few weeks ago I loaned ten thousand to Jackson Kegley , and I was figurin ' on loanin ' him the ten thousand they stole . " " Who 's Kegley ? " " Kegley ? He owns the Rest . Got a big cattle spread west of town . Runs eight , nine thousand head of stock . His place runs clean up to West Fork . That 's where the Tom Roway place is . " " Roway 's the man you think done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bates shrugged . " I ai n't seen Tom Roway but twice in five years . He killed a couple of men in shootin ' scrapes , then went to the pen for shootin ' a man in the back . " Three years ago he came back and brought Mig Barnes along . Barnes is pretty tough himself , or so they say . " " Why did you suspect Roway ? " " Bob Singer ... he 's a puncher around here , seen that paint horse . I guess everybody else saw it , too . The gent who used the rifle was ridin ' that paint . Sorrel splash on the left hip and several dabs of color on the left shoulder . " " Did you send a posse after them ? " Bates looked embarrassed " Nobody would go . Tom Roway is mighty handy with a rifle and he 's fast with a six-shooter . Bob Singer is pretty salty himself , and he would n't go , and after that , people just sort of backed off . Finally Kegley , Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail in the waters of West Fork . " " Joel ? " " My son . He 's twenty-one , and a pretty good tracker . " Chick walked past the bank . There was a bullet hole in the side window of the bank , too . When they started shooting in some of these towns , they surely shot things up . He walked on to the Rancher 's Rest and stepped inside . Aside from the bartender , there were three men in the saloon . The big , handsome man standing at the bar had a pleasant face , and he turned to smile at Bowdrie as he entered . A man at a card table playing solitaire had a tied-down gun . The third man was a lantern-jawed puncher with straw-colored hair . " You 'll be Bowdrie , I guess , " the big man said . " I am Jackson Kegley . This is my place . " " How 're you ? " Chick glanced at the straw-haired puncher . He grinned with wry humor . " I 'm Rip Coker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer . Better keep an eye on him , Ranger , he 's mighty slick with an iron , either shootin ' or brandin ' . " Singer glared at Coker , and his lips thinned as he looked down at his cards . Chick noticed the glance , then turned his attention to Kegley . " You know Roway . Do you think he done it ? " " I would n't know . He 's a damn good shot . We trailed him as far as the West Fork . " Coker leaned his forearms on the bar . His plaid shirt was faded and worn . " Roway 's not so bad , " he commented , " and I do n't think he done it . " Singer was impatient . " Nobody could miss that paint hoss , " he suggested . " Ai n't another in the country like it . " Coker gave Singer a disgusted glance . " Then why would he ride it ? If you was robbin ' a bank , would you ride the most noticeable horse around ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up , but he offered no comment . " I 'll look around some , " Bowdrie said . He walked outside , studying the street again . There was a suggestion of an idea in his mind , and something felt wrong about the whole affair . He went to the hotel section of the Rest and signed for a room , then strolled outside . Something in the dust at his feet caught his eye , and he stepped down off the walk , running the dust through his fingers . He took something from the dust , placed it carefully inside a folded cigarette paper , and put it in his wallet . Singer had come out of the saloon and was watching him . Bowdrie ignored him and strolled down to where his horse was tied . He was swinging into the saddle when Bates came to the door . " You ai n't goin ' after him alone , are you ? " Bowdrie shrugged . " Why not ? I have n't seen any of his graveyards around . " He turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uneasy . There was something wrong here , it was too pat , too set up , and they were too ready to accuse Roway . " Personally , " Bowdrie told the roan , " I agree with Coker . An outlaw using a horse everybody knew , that does n't even make sense . " The trail was good for the first few miles , then became steadily worse . It wound higher and higher into rougher and rougher country . Skimpy trails edged around cliffs with dropoffs of several hundred feet to the bottom of dry canyons . Then , of a sudden , the trail spilled over a ridge into a green meadow , and that meadow opened into still another , each one skirted by borders of trees . At the end of the last meadow was a cabin , smoke rising from the chimney . A few cattle grazed nearby , and there were horses in the corral . Chick Bowdrie rode up and stepped down . One of the horses in the corral was a paint with a splash of sorrel on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an unusual marking , unlikely to be duplicated . " Lookin ' for something ? " The tone was harsh , and Bowdrie took care to keep his hands away from his guns . The man stood at the door of his cabin not twenty feet away . He was a hard-visaged man with an unshaved face and cold eyes under bushy black brows . He wore a gun in a worn holster , and beyond him inside the door another man sat on a chair with a rifle across his knees . " Are you Tom Roway ? " " And what if I am ? " Bowdrie studied him coolly for a long minute and then said , " I 'm Chick Bowdrie , a Ranger . We 've got to have a talk . " " I 've heard of you . I 've no call to like the law , but you want to talk , come on in . Coffee 's on . " The man at the door put down his rifle and put a tin plate and a cup on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ai n't often we have a Ranger for chow , " he commented . Roway sat down , filling three cups . " All right , Ranger , speak your piece . What business do you have with us ? " " Have you been ridin ' that paint horse lately ? " " I ride that paint most of the time . " " Did you ride into Morales Monday morning an stick up the bank ? " " What kind of a question is that ? No , I did n't rob no bank and I ai n't been in Morales in a month ! What is this ? Some kind of a frame-up ? " " Five men robbed the bank at Morales Monday morning , and one of them was ridin ' a paint horse , a dead ringer for that one out yonder . " Bowdrie gestured toward the corral . " Where was that horse on Monday ? " " Right where he is now . He ai n't been off this place in a week . " He looked up , scowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen people . He was right out in plain sight . Nobody could 've missed him . One who identified him was Bob Singer . " " Singer ? " Roway 's eyes flashed . " I 'll kill him ! " " No you wo n't , " Bowdrie said . " If there 's any killin ' done , I 'll do it . " For a moment their eyes locked , but Roway was the first to look away . Mig Barnes had been watching , and now he spoke . " Do you reckon Tom would be so foolish as to ride to a holdup with the most known horse in the county ? He 'd have to be crazy ! " He gestured outside . " We 've got a cavvy of broncs all colors an ' kinds . He could take his pick , so why ride the one horse everybody knows ? " " I thought of that , " Bowdrie agreed , " and it does n't look like anybody with a place like this would want to steal . You boys have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw ! " Roway said . " Grass all year around and water that never gives out . Our cattle are always fat . " " Has anybody ever tried to buy you out ? " Bowdrie asked casually . " You might say that . Jackson Kegley wanted to buy it from me , and for that matter , so did old man Bates . Then some of Kegley 's boys made a pass at running me off the place a few years back . We sort of discouraged ' em , Mig an ' me , we shoot too straight . " The coffee was good , so Bowdrie sat and talked awhile . The two were hard men , no doubt about that , but competent . Nobody in his right mind would try to drive them off a place situated like this . Bowdrie knew their kind . He had ridden with them , worked cattle with them . Left alone , they would be no trouble to anyone . Neither of these men shaped up like a murderer . They would kill , but only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed themselves in the right . The idea persisted that the bank cashier had been shot deliberately , and for a reason . But what reason ? Bowdrie was not taking Roway 's word for it as far as the paint horse went , but he did not have to . He already had some thoughts about that , and an idea was beginning to take shape that might provide an answer . It was a long ride back to Morales , and Bowdrie had time to think . The sun was hot , but up in the high country where he was , the breeze was pleasant . Bowdrie took his time . Riding horseback had always been conducive to thinking , and now he turned over in his mind each one of the elements . When he arrived at a point where he could overlook the town , he drew rein . Morales , what there was of it , lay spread out below him like a map , and there are few things better than a map for getting the right perspective . The paint horse was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , but Bowdrie had been quick to see it himself . To ride such a horse in a robbery meant that a man was insane or he was trying to point a finger of suspicion at its owner . " What I want to know , Hammerhead , " he said to the roan , " is how that fifth bandit got away . More than likely , if he rode around behind the Rest an ' took to the woods , he had to come this way to keep from sight . He had to know a trail leading him up to the breaks of this plateau without using the main trail . " For two hours he scouted the rim , returning to town finally with the realization that there was no way to reach the top without taking the main trail in full sight of the town . " And if he did n't use the main trail , he just never left town at all ! " Several men were running toward the bank as he rode into the street . Dropping from the saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the others . Hearing someone coming up behind him , he turned to see Jackson Kegley . " What 's happened ? " Kegley asked . " Do n't know , " Chick said . When they rounded the corner of the bank , they saw a small knot of men standing at the rear of the bank . Bowdrie glanced at Kegley . His face was flushed and he was breathing harder than what a fast walk should cause . A bad heart , maybe ? Bob Singer was there , his features taut and strained . " It 's Joel Bates . He 's been knifed . " Chick stepped through the crowd . He looked down at the banker 's son . A good-looking boy , a handsome boy , and well-made . Too young to die with a knife in the back . " Anybody see what happened ? " Chick asked . Rip Coker was rolling a smoke . " He was investigatin ' this here robbery . I reckon he got too close . " " I found him , " Henry Plank said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fringe of reddish hair . " I come through here a lot , going to Big Jim 's barn . He was lyin ' just like you see him , on his chest , head turned sidewise , and a knife in his back . " " When did you come through here last ? " Bowdrie asked . " I mean , before you found the body ? " " About an hour ago . He was n't lyin ' there then . I walked right over that spot . " Chick squatted on his heels beside the body . The knife was still in the wound , an ordinary hunting knife of a kind commonly used . There probably were as many such knives in town as there were men . This one was rusty . Probably an old knife somebody had picked up . He bent closer , lifting the dead man 's hand . In the grain of the flesh there were tiny bits of white . His hand looked much as it would if he had gripped a not-quite-dry paintbrush . Bowdrie stood up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this weather it would not lose heat very fast . Bowdrie was guessing that Joel Bates had been dead for considerably more than an hour , but if so , where had the body been ? Big Jim , stunned by grief and shock , stood nearby . Only that morning Bowdrie had heard Bates speak with pride of his son , the son who now lay cold and dead . Chick Bowdrie was suddenly angry . He turned to face the group . " The man who killed this boy is in this crowd . He is the same man who engineered the bank robbery . I know why he did it and I have a very good hunch who he is , and I 'm going to see him hang if it is the last thing I do ! " Turning sharply , he walked away , still angry . Perhaps he had been foolish to say what he 'd said , and this was no time for anger , yet when he saw that fine-looking young man lying there ... He walked back toward the barn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sunlight fell through a few cracks in the boards . There were three horses in the stalls and there were stacks of hay . At one side of the old barn was a buckboard . Chick was following a hunch now , and quickly , methodically , he began to search . His success was immediate  --  a pot of white paint hidden under sacks and piled hay . " Found somethin ' ? " Bowdrie glanced up , a queer chill flowing through him . So engrossed had he been in his search that he had failed to hear the man enter . His carelessness angered him . It was Bob Singer . " Yeah , " Bowdrie said , " I 've found something , all right . " Gingerly he lifted the pot with his left hand , turning it slowly . On one side was a clear imprint of a thumb , a thumbprint with a peculiar ropy scar across it . " Yes , I 've found something . This is the paint that was used to paint a horse to look like Roway 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be crazy ! " Several men had followed them into the barn and were listening . " Somebody , " Bowdrie said , " figured on stickin ' Roway with this robbery . He painted a horse to look like Roway 's . " " And left the paint can here ? " Singer said . " It must have been young Bates himself . " " It was n't young Bates . You see ... "  --  Bowdrie looked at Singer  --  " I 've known that horse was painted from the first . He stamped his feet and some paint fell off into the dust up in front of the Rest . Young Joel must 've figured out the same thing . Either that horse was painted here or young Joel found that bucket of paint and brought it here to hide . " The man who painted that horse followed him here and knifed him . He left him in the barn until there was nobody around , then carried him out here , because he did not want anybody nosin ' around the barn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandit is nowhere around Morales now . He got away and he 's kept goin ' . " " No , " Chick said , the dimplelike scar under his cheekbone seeming to deepen , " that bandit never even left town . " " What ? " Singer 's tone was hoarse . " What d' you mean ? " " I mean , Singer , " Bowdrie said , " that you were the man on that paint horse . You were the man who murdered Joel Bates . You 've got a scar on the ball of your thumb , which I noticed earlier , and that thumbprint is on this can of paint ! " " Why , you ... ! " Singer 's hand clasped his gun butt . Bowdrie 's gun boomed in the close confines of the barn , and Singer 's gun slipped from nerveless fingers . " Singer ! " Plank gasped . " Who would have thought it was him ? But who are the others ? The other four ? " " Five , " Bowdrie said . " Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn again . " You mean there was another man in on this ? " " Yeah . " Bowdrie 's eyes shifted from face to face and back . Lingering on Bates , then moving on to Kegley and Mig Barnes , who had just come in . " There was another . There was the man who planned the whole affair . " He walked to the door , and some of the others lifted Singer 's body and carried it out . Jackson Kegley looked over at Bowdrie . " Singer was supposed to be good with a gun . " There was no expression on Bowdrie 's hawklike face . " It ai n't the ones like Singer a man has to watch . It 's the ones who will shoot you in the back . Like the man , " he added , " who killed Lem Pullitt ! " " What d' you mean by that ? Pullitt was shot  --  " " Lem Pullitt was shot in the back , and not by one of the three in the bank . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had gone to his room in the Rest and had taken a brief nap . From boyhood he had slept when there was opportunity and eaten when he found time . He had taken time to shave and change his shirt , thinking all the while . The ways of dishonest men were never as clever as they assumed , and the solving of a crime was usually just a painstaking job of establishing motives and putting together odds and ends of information . Criminals suffered from two very serious faults . They believed everybody else was stupid , and the criminal himself was always optimistic as to his chances of success . The idea that men stole because they were poor or hungry was nonsense . Men or women stole because they wanted more , and wanted it without working for it . They stole to have money to flash around , to spend on liquor , women , or clothes . They stole because they wanted more faster . Walking into the Chuck Wagon , Bowdrie took a seal at the far end of the table where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somewhere around , and he was the one who had the most to lose . Bates was not in the Wagon , nor was Kegley , but Henry Plank was , and a number of punchers in off the range . One by one he singled out their faces , and there were one or two whom he recognized . As the thin , worn man who waited on the tables came to him to take his order , Bowdrie asked , " Who 's the big man with the red beard ? And the dark , heavy one with the black hair on his chest ? " " Red Hammill , who rides for Big Jim Bates . Ben Bowyer used to ride for Kegley , but he rides for Bates now . They ai n't tenderfeet . " " No , " Bowdrie agreed , " Hammill rode in the Lincoln County War , and Bowyer 's from up in the Territory . " Rip Coker threaded his way through the tables to where Bowdrie sat . " Watch your step , Ranger . There 's something cookin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Thanks . Where do you stand ? " " I liked Lem . He staked me to grub when I first come to town . " Without having any evidence , Bowdrie was almost positive Hammill and Bowyer had been involved in the holdup . Both men were listed as wanted in the Rangers ' bible , both had been involved in such crimes before this . As wanted men they were subject to arrest in any event , but Bowdrie was concentrating on the present crime . Or crimes , for now another murder was involved . There had been others . Was Coker one of them ? He doubted it , because the man seemed sincere and also there had been obvious enmity between Coker and Singer , who had been involved . Who was the man behind it ? Who had planned and engineered the holdup ? He believed he knew , but was he right ? Bates opened the door and stepped into the room . His eyes found Bowdrie and he crossed the room to him . " I guess my bank will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle to Kegley , and that will tide me over . " " You gettin ' a good price ? " Bates winced . " Not really . He was planning to stock blooded cattle , but he 's buyin ' mine instead . Sort of a favor . " Chick Bowdrie got up suddenly . " Coker , " he whispered , " get Bates out of here , fast ! " He thought he had caught a signal from Hammill to Bowyer , and he was sure they planned to kill him tonight . There had been an appearance of planned movement in the way they came in , the seats they chose , the moves they made . He hoped his sudden move would force a change of plan or at least throw their present plans out of kilter . " I 'm hittin ' the hay , " he said to Coker , speaking loud enough to be heard . He started for the door . He stepped through the swinging doors , turned toward the Rest , then circled out into the street beyond the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stage station . Almost at once the doors spread and Red Hammill stepped out , followed by Bowyer . " Where 'd he go ? " Red spoke over his shoulder . " He sure ducked out of sight mighty quick ! " " Bates is still inside , " Bowyer said , " an ' Rip Coker is with him . " " It 's that Ranger I want , " Hammill said . " I think he knew me . Maybe you , too . Let 's go up to the Rest . " They started for the Rest , walking fast . Bowdrie sprinted across to the blacksmith shop . Hammill turned sharply , too late to detect the movement . " You hear somethin ' ? " he asked Bowyer . " Sounded like somebody runnin ' ! " " Lookin ' for me , Red ? " Bowdrie asked . Red Hammill was a man of action . His pistol flashed and a slug buried itself in the water trough . Bowdrie sprinted for the next building , and both men turned at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you two ! Let 's step into the street and finish this ! " " Like that , is it ? " The voice came from close on his right . Mig Barnes ! Bowdrie fired , heard a muffled curse , but it did not sound like a wounded man . A movement from behind him turned his head . Now they had him boxed . But who was the other one ? Was it Roway ? He backed against the wall . The door was locked . On tiptoes he made it to the edge of the building , holding to the deepest shadow . He saw a dim shape rise up and the gleam of a pistol barrel . Who the devil was that ? A new voice , muffled , spoke up . " You 're close , Tex ! Give it to him ! " The shadow with the pistol raised up , the pistol lifting , and Bowdrie fired . " You 're on the wrong side , mister ! " he said , and ducked down the alley between the buildings , circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street just as Bowyer , easily recognized from his build , started across it . Bowdrie 's bullet knocked the man to his knees . Red Hammill fired in reply , and a shot burned close to Chick , who was flattened in a shallow doorway . He started to move , and his toe touched something . A small chunk of wood . Picking it up , he tossed it against the wall of the livery stable . It landed with a thud , and three lances of flame darted . Instantly Chick fired , heard a grunt , then the sound of a falling body . A bullet stung his face with splinters and he dropped flat and wormed his way forward , then stopped , thumbed shells into his right-hand gun , and waited . Tex was out of it , whoever he was . Bowyer had been hit , too . Chick thought he had hit Bowyer twice . He waited , but there was no sound . He had an idea this was not to their taste , while street fighting was an old story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of that muffled voice . There had been an effort to disguise the tone . He was sure his guess was right . They intended to kill Bates , too . Maybe that was where ... He came to his feet and went into the saloon with a lunge . There was no shot . The men in red face gone pale , eyes wide , stood against the bar . Rip Coker stood in the corner not far away , a gun in his hand . Red Hammill stood just inside the back door and Mig Barnes was a dozen feet to the right of the door . Why his dive into the room had n't started the shooting , he could not guess , unless it was the alert Coker standing ready with a gun . Hammill and Barnes were men to be reckoned with , but where was Roway ? The back door opened suddenly and Jackson Kegley came in , taking a quick glance around the room . " Bates ! " Bowdrie directed . " Walk to the front door and do n't get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand started , then froze . Bates stumbled from the room , and Bowdrie 's attention shifted to Kegley . " Just the man we needed , " Bowdrie said . " You were the one who killed Lem Pullitt . You stood in an upstairs bedroom of the Rancher 's Rest and shot him when his back was to the window . " " That 's a lie ! " " Why play games ? " Mig Barnes said . " We got ' em dead to rights . Me , I want that long-jawed Coker myself . " " You can have him ! " Coker said , and Mig Barnes went for his gun . In an instant the room was laced with a deadly crossfire of shooting . Rip Coker opened up with both guns and Chick Bowdrie let Hammill have his first shot , knocking the big redhead back against the bar . Kegley was working his way along the wall , trying to get behind Bowdrie . As Hammill pushed himself away from the bar , Bowdrie fired into him twice . Switching to Kegley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty chamber . He dropped the gun into a holster and opened up with the left-hand gun . Kegley fired and Bowdrie felt the shock of the bullet , but he was going in fast . He swung his right fist and knocked the bigger man to the floor . He fell to his knees , then staggered up as Kegley lunged to his feet , covered with blood . Bowdrie fired again and saw the big man slide down the wall to the floor . Bowdrie 's knees were weak and he began to stagger , then fell over to the floor . When he fought back to consciousness , Rip Coker was beside him . Rip had a red streak along the side of his face and there was blood on his shirt . Bates , Henry Plank , and Tom Roway were all there . " We 've been workin ' it out just like I think you had it figured , " Henry said . " Kegley wanted a loan and got Bates to have the money in the bank . He killed Lem , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted the bank himself , and Bates 's range as well . He planned to get Tom Roway in trouble so he could take over that ranch and run Bates 's cattle on it . " Mig Barnes apparently sold out to Kegley , but Lem Pullitt guessed what was in Kegley 's mind , because he could see no reason Kegley would need a loan . Kegley was afraid Lem would talk Bates out of loaning him the money . Kegley hated Lem because Lem was not afraid of him and was suspicious of his motives . " " After you was out to my place , " Roway said , " I got to thinkin ' . I 'd seen Barnes ride off by himself a time or two and found where he 'd been meetin ' Tex and Bowyer . I figured out what was goin ' on , so I mounted up an ' came on in . " Coker helped Bowdrie to his feet . " You 're in bad shape , Bowdrie . You lost some blood and you 'd best lay up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowdrie said , " you should be a Ranger . If ever a man was built for the job , you are ! " " I am a Ranger . " Coker chuckled , pleased with his comment . " Just from another company . I was trailin ' Red Hammill . " Chick Bowdrie lay back on the bed and listened to the retreating footsteps of Coker , Plank , and Bates . He stared up at the ceiling , alone again . Seemed he was alone most of the time , but that was the way it had always been for him , since he was a youngster . Now , if he could just find a place like Tom Roway had ... Continues ...
