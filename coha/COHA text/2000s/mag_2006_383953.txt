While the Bazaar editor was swanning around in dirndl skirts , her trusty jeans became pass . Can she get her denim mojo back ? Read on for Sarah Bailey 's confessions of a hornagain jeans virgin . Plus : new ways to wear your jeans , the latest celeb picks , and the brands with buzz // Why did I stop wearing jeans ? Short answer : I just stopped buying them . It 's an odd admission from someone who in every other area of wardrobe acquisition is proud to be a speed shopper with a pretty honed sense of what works ( litmus test : if I deliberate over a purchase for more than five minutes , it 's invariably wrong ) . But jeans buying , as every woman knows , is another country . In truth , the realization that I 'd stopped wearing jeans crept up on me . I had a vague sense that swathes of clothing in my closet that can be roughly categorized as " things that look good with jeans " were beginning to fester unworn and forlorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket I 'd carefully transported from storage in England to wear to holiday parties in New York . The jacket is so elaborately OTT ( very Iris Apfel ) , it works only with jeans . But as I stood in front of my mirror and beheld the sight of myself in my-whisper it-four-year-old Sevens , nothing looked right . Not only were said jeans tattered and faded to a point that was not cool , but the leg shape was thick and cloddish and wrong . An homage to Linda Evangelista 's black-tie denim ensemble of Lanvin and Notifys at the CFDA Awards this was not . My jeans , dear reader , had gone out of fashion . The thing about jeans abstinence ( purposeful or , as in my case , not ) is that you stop thinking of yourself in a jeans-wearing silhouette . After seasons of skirt supremacy , this scarcely seemed to matter . Yet somewhere deep inside I knew I missed the insouciant kick in my step one can get only from wearing jeans . But which ones ? For years I 'd known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot-cut Sevens were chosen for buttshrinking pocket placement , leg-lengthening tricks , and a rough boyish wash ) . I also knew the denim person I absolutely was n't ( low-rise , thong-revealing hipsters will never be my speed ) . But in the intervening phase , things had changed . Thanks to Kate Moss et al . in their superslim strides , boot cuts were absolute bygones . Inadvertently , I 'd become a born-again jeans virgin . " Think skinny , " counsels my friend Kristina , emphasizing her point by bunching shameful wads of imaginary fabric flapping around her ankles . " The right pair of jeans is in the eye of the beholder , " says Renzo Rosso , Diesel 's sultan of denim , when I present my shopping quest to him . " The important thing is to spend time finding the right pair for you . " Time . Hmm . Rather than squander precious trying-on hours explaining to so many languid store assistants my body shape and my desire to look like Sienna Miller in pants , my colleague Joseph orders bales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Oh , how many pages of comic writing could be dedicated to what does not work : the hot-off-therunway looks with waistbands that hit mid-hip bone , imparting the dreaded muffin top ; overzealous leg tapering with the uncanny ability to make me look like Nathan Lane in tights ... Happily , there are more spiritually uplifting styles from companies with a deliberate body-positive , girl-power agenda . Jeans by Paige Adams-Geller , a former fit model for Seven , come with a little card in the hidden pocket , bearing the message " I want you to : Love your body . " ( Paige 's Melrose straight leg is , I can report , magically ass-flattering and , as it says here in my notebook , " gives good thighs . " ) Joe 's Jeans " Honey " booty fit " ( words I never thought I 'd ever type ) fit a girl-shaped bottom neatly and discreetly and , despite what you might think , feature no peculiar whiskering effects . Clean is it , ladies-all that dodgy bleached anatomical contouring just screams mall jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of ash-colored jeans by Taverniti So . This pair is different . They do n't just fit well ; the gray denim looks very right for now . I also like the way the legs taper just so and scrunch around my ankles . I feel fierce . I fish around in my closet for my black Lanvin trench and snakeskin heels and take a twirl around my apartment in my new look . This is a revelation . " You can definitely wear skinny , tapered jeans even if you are not a skinny person , " says denim visionary Nicole Colovos , formerly of Habitual . ( I had asked . ) " Yes , " agrees Stella McCartney definitively ( the designer who , according to no less than Madonna , makes the jeans most becoming to a lady 's posterior ) . " Wear a fuller , longer top ; it will create an illusion of skinny , long legs , " advises Colovos , who also recommends buying jeans in a longer length " so they bunch around your ankles to create a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says her own favorite way to wear denim right now is " my husband 's sweater , my skinny jeans , with ankle boots . " I feel I can go no further in my jeans odyssey without discussing the controversial s-t-r-e-t-c-h word ( blame deeply embedded memories from my youth : spandex denim + bad fit = Debbie Gibson ) . McCartney herself swears by stretch for the perfect ass-flattering jean . " It follows all the curves , " she opines . I conclude McCartney is right . Stretch is my friend . Not only does it expand to accommodate one 's , ahem , curves , it snaps you back into place corset-style . For instance , Levi 's Skinny 503 jeans cut higher at the back and tight on the legs fit like a glove and give a great line ( I check the label-ha ! -1 percent spandex ) . Diesel 's fantastically skinny-making Liv style is another case in point : dark and clean , containing 2 percent elastan and not even a suggestion of mom jean . 1 also try a very cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with quirky gold topstitching , in ultradark , rigid denim ( 2 percent spandex-who knew ? ) . The look is very cool , very Japanese , calling out to be paired with gray Prada-esque socks and red patent flats . " The elegance of a jean depends on the length adapted to the style of shoes , " says Maurice Ohayon , designer of Notify jeans . " Consequently , you must have a denim wardrobe to play with different styles at different moments of the day . " Skinny legs aside , I decide my multifaceted denim wardrobe must include a pair of superrelaxed Seminole jeans from Stitch 's : the soft feel , antiqued rivets , and sweet floral fabric patched inside the waistband suggest they were found in a Catskills antique store , and they look perfect with Marni sandal flats . For tooling around on weekends , add Jean Shop 's Boyfriend jeans , cut in a boiled-looking , butt-flattening raw denim . Very Brokeback Mountain . As for cracking the secret of black-tie denim ( channel Linda , channel Linda ) , Ohayon is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the legs , and a very dark wash treated to give a shiny effect like in a tuxedo dress pant . Wearing a classic blue denim for a black-tie party is an absolute no-no . " Adds McCartney , " Less of the distressed look . Go unwashed . " Me ? The next time I try a major evening piece with denim , I 'm going to wear Edun 's ultradark Dreamweaver jeans in Ebony , which look like they 've been dipped in charcoal dust . There 's a point in one 's jeans learning curve when a girl knows she is ready for the custom denim experience . At An Earnest Cut &; Sew , Earnest Sewn 's concept store in New York 's meatpacking district , the choice is heady . The line 's philosophy is to offer jeans that have been made individually-the hand finishing and tiny inconsistencies just add to the jeans ' robust , achingly cool authenticity . The store 's bespoke service is its ultimate expression of this way of thinking , with prices starting at $460 and going considerably higher depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , you pick your style . I go for the skinny Harlan cigarette leg in dark , whiskerless denim . Then you choose your candy ( I love the cute Japanese buttons on offer and go for one featuring a little skull ) and thread options ( I select burnt orange and baby blue ) . The designer , Scott Morrison , is on hand for my fitting , happy to explain the figure-flattening science of Earnest Sewn pockets , each one graded according to the size of the jean . " We even go so far as to change the stitching according to the size , " he says . " It 's all very subtle , but ultimately it makes a difference to the wearer . " Morrison owns more than 600 pairs of jeans and crafts contemporary wood furniture at his Woodstock , New York , home , and frankly , if he 'd been cast as Aidan in Sex and the City , the whole of the last season might have gone differently . He recommends I order my Harlans in a stretch fabric made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be baked in a kiln for a tough , cool , sheeny finish . When my bespoke babies arrive , they 're packed in a box that looks like it 's from a Little House on the Prairie trading post . Wearing them , I feel as light as air . " Denim is sexy when it 's worn by someone who 's comfortable in their own skin , no matter the style , brand , or fit , " says Morrison . " I 'll never forget seeing a photo of Helena Christensen wearing a pair of loose-fitting boys ' vintage Levi 's , and I ca n't imagine her looking better , ever . " And that is the story of how I got my jeans mojo back . On weekends I 've taken to wearing my casual Stitch 's jeans with Miu Miu glitter pumps and an oversize parka . I feel younger ; I feel thinner . For days when I am being Ms. Chic around town , my dark cigarette Harlan jeans look sharp with a shrunken jacket and a little blouse that puffs over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right again-not so lady . In fact , I was striding into my building in just this getup the other day when my doorman , his expression clouded with lack of recognition , stopped me : " Excuse me , can I help you ? " he asked . " It 's me ! " I squeal , not-so-secretly delighted . " I live here . " A pair of denims that maketh a girl over ? Priceless . Sidebar The hits her stride in her new skinny jeans .
