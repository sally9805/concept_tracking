Editor 's note : <p> The original version of the headline incorrectly read " high school . " <p> Administrators at an Arizona middle school are asking the US Supreme Court to rule that they did not violate the privacy rights of an eighth-grade girl who was strip-searched in a fruitless attempt to find suspected drugs . <p> At issue in the case , set for argument Tuesday morning , is whether the strip search of a 13-year-old girl by school officials is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment . <p> Lawyers for the girl and her mother say it was an unconstitutional invasion of the girl 's privacy . School officials say their actions were justified because they were trying to protect the student population from a risk to their health and safety . <p> The case could set a national standard for how far school officials can go in conducting searches of students property - and even their bodies - while investigating alleged violations of school policies and rules . <p> " This is the case where the Supreme Court is likely to decide how easy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham Boyd , one of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) lawyers representing the girl and her mother . <p> In addition , the high court is being asked to decide whether the assistant principal who authorized the strip search can be shielded by qualified immunity from a lawsuit filed against him by the girl 's mother . <p> Boyd and ACLU lawyer Adam Wolf say the search was based on just one unreliable accusation by a fellow student , which is not sufficient reason to justify such an intrusive search . <p> " A child 's ' private parts are not subject to observation by school officials without significant justification , " said Mr. Wolf , in the brief for the schoolgirl and her mother . <p> School officials counter that the search was justified under a 24-year-old Supreme Court precedent that allows flexibility in how administrators may respond to issues related to school safety . <p> In 1985 , the high court authorized school officials to search students purses and backpacks when they had reasonable grounds to suspect the search would turn up evidence . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search must not be " excessively intrusive in light of the student 's age and sex and the nature of the infraction . " <p> The current case stems from a strip search conducted in October 2003 at Safford Middle School in Safford , Ariz . The girl , Savana Redding , was suspected of bringing high-strength ibuprofen to school to share with other students during lunch . <p> One of Savana 's friends identified her as the source of the prescription drugs , under questioning by the school 's assistant principal , Kerry Wilson . <p> Mr. Wilson then questioned Savana . She denied any involvement or knowledge of the prescription drugs . Wilson searched her backpack and found nothing improper . The assistant principal then instructed a female staff member to take Savana to the school nurse 's office . <p> Savana was told to undress . The staff member and the nurse watched the girl remove her shoes and socks , and then her shirt and pants . No pills were discovered in the shoes or clothing . Redding was instructed to " pull out her panties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " according to the Reddings brief . " This order forced Savana to expose her genital area and breasts to the school officials , " the brief says . No pills were discovered . <p> " The school officials viewing of Savana 's naked body was the most humiliating experience of her life , " Wolf says in his brief . <p> Throughout the confrontation , Savana , an honor roll student , was not permitted to call her mother , the brief says . <p> The school district 's brief does not dispute any of the details of the search . It does add : " All of this was done without anyone touching Redding . " <p> School officials say the strip search was justified in part because a year earlier a student had smuggled prescription pills into school and distributed them to classmates . One student had an adverse reaction and had to be airlifted 100 miles away to a Tucson hospital . <p> The Redding questioning and search was prompted after a male student went to Wilson , the assistant principal , to inform him that pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take them during lunch hour . The student told Wilson he 'd received the pill from Marissa Glines . <p> Wilson questioned Marissa and asked her to empty her pockets . She produced several pills , and said they had come from Savana . <p> School officials say the combination of factors provided enough evidence to justify the subsequent strip search of Savana . The Reddings lawyers disagree . <p> " Where the school is going wrong is that they do n't seem to understand that searching a backpack is dramatically different than asking a student to take their clothes off , " says Mr. Boyd . <p> Privacy vs. safety <p> The National School Boards Association and the American Association of School Administrators filed a friend of the court brief supporting the school officials . <p> " School officials should be afforded legal clarity and appropriate deference when making on-the-spot decisions that require the balancing of student privacy with the need to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment for all students , " writes David Day in the National School Boards Association brief . He added that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are charged with preserving the learning environment and protecting the safety of students . <p> In another friend of the court brief , Raymond Brescia , a professor at Albany Law School , examined the historical record of student search cases . " Given our historical traditions of treatment of students in school , this is way beyond the pale . Such a strip search never would have been conceivable in a one-room schoolhouse of 1835 , " he says . <p> He added , " There are no reported cases out there of a teacher seeking these powers . " <p> Boyd says school officials must be mindful of the potential impact of their actions on students . He cited specialists who say that for some children the experience of being strip-searched is similar to sexual abuse . <p> After the strip search incident , Savana Redding developed bleeding ulcers , says Boyd . " Savana has never returned to that school , " he says . " She refused to go back . " <p> A decision in the case is expected by late June . <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
