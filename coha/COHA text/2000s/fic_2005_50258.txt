K. D. Wen t worth lives in Tulsa , Oklahoma , where she works as an elementary school teacher and says she has mastered the art of cafeteria riot patrol . Her novels include The Imperium Game , Black/on/Black , Stars Over Stars , and Moonspeaker . Her most recent book is a collaboration with Eric Flint , The Course of Empire , and she is currently collaborating with Mr. Flint on another novel . In this new story , she offers up a sweet and entertaining bit of blasphemy . No word yet from MeI Gibson about a possible film option . <p> MY BEST FRIEND , HARMONY , wanted to come over and study , so I called home and asked Jesus what was for dinner . He said he did n't know and he did n't care . Since he was fasting , he was n't coming out of his living room niche , even if Mom baked lasagna , his favorite . I should get my mind on more important things , he said , like the state of my immortal soul . Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood how boring he was going to be once he learned to talk , she would never have taken out the loan to buy a stupid Son-of-God clone in the first place . I would have rather had a shiny black Hummer , but I was only two at the time and no one asked me . Dad split when I was ten and Jesus was eight , said he could n't take it anymore . Even at eight , Jesus was a bit much , bringing home road-kill kittens all the time so he could try to raise them from the dead . Harmony thought having your own Jesus was creepy , said you might as well live in a church and drink holy water instead of orange juice for breakfast . But she was Catholic and had to listen to the priests rant every Sunday about the holy clones biz . You 'd think she would have felt connected . After all , it was the Shroud of Turin that started the whole mess , but she said Protestant scientists dreamed all this up , so we could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , she was a pain sometimes . As for Jesus , he did n't like Harmony either . She was always rude to him and had this spiky black hair . He said the spikes reminded him of nails , and it does n't take a brain surgeon to know how a Jesus feels about nails . Whenever she came over , he would mutter about " suffer the little children " and all that . Harmony would get mad and point out she was seventeen , not a stupid kid ! Jesus would just smile knowingly , like he was n't a good two years younger . After school that day , Harmony and I came in the back door and dumped our books on the table . The kitchen still smelled like bacon from breakfast , and Jesus had totally ignored the dirty dishes in the sink . How could he be home all day and never lift a friggin " finger ? I ca n't believe we 're still making payments on him . Mom might as well have burned that money . I had intermediate trig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scarlet Letter , the most clueless novel ever written . I 'd already turned mine in . So Hester hooked up with the minister , I 'd pointed out . So what ? She was young . Why should n't she have a good time ? Those Puritan dudes seriously needed to get over themselves . At the counter , Jesus 's eyes were practically crossed as he stared at a glass of water . His acne had flared up again , and he 'd let his hair get long and ratty in imitation of you-know-who . He needed to get over himself too . " That water 's not going to change , " I said , just to be mean . " Shut up , Bailee , " he said defensively . " It 's already turning pink ! " " Yeah , right , " I said . Harmony flipped through The Scarlet Letter , then stared down at the text morosely . " Every time I try to read this , I want to slap that ho , Hester , " she said . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tolerance , " Jesus said . He struck a noble stance , something at which he 'd spent a lot of time practicing . " Judge not , lest ye be judged . " " Oh , give it a rest ! " Harmony glared over her shoulder at his skinny ass . " Are n't you supposed to be off in a hole somewhere ? " He picked up the glass and drained it . " Yes , " he said , " definitely wine , a nice , full-bodied Cabemet . " " His hole is called a niche , " I said , " and it 's for meditation and prayer . He does n't have to sit in it unless he wants to . " I opened my trig book and pulled out a sheet of half-completed problems . " He 's not a slave . " " He 's not a person either , Bailee , " Harmony said , " else he 'd have to go to school like us . " Actually , the first few Jesus clones did go to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too disruptive . " Mom had tried to enroll him in woodworking classes down at the Vo-Tech , but he refused to attend even the first one , so these days our Jesus studied at home , when he did anything useful , which was n't very often . We worked for half an hour , while Jesus amused himself back in the pantry , pulling slices of bread to bits to see if he could make the pieces multiply . Finally , the numbers in my problems were blurring . My brain was about to implode , and I could n't stand it anymore . " I 'm off to Holes-to-Go at the mall for another piercing , " I said . " Lanie Andrews has four holes in her ears now too , and I 'll just die if I do n't get a fifth before she does . " " Did n't Principal Wingate say you could n't have more than three piercings ? " Harmony scraped back her chair . " You 're already pushing the envelope . Do you want to get sent home again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ? " I stretched , then glanced over at Jesus . " Want to come ? " " Euew ! " Harmony said . Jesus brushed the crumbs off his hands . I noticed he was wearing his best faded jeans , suitably saggy and ragged around the cuffs , and a new orange Hawaiian shirt , artfully wrinkled . He was big for his age , taller than either one of us , and actually did n't look too bad , for someone supposed to be so sacred . Had he planned this all along ? He smiled , flashing us a mouthful of braces that featured a football on every tooth . " Is n't there a fountain at the mall ? " " Oh , no , " Harmony said . She dabbed mousse on her black hair and ran her fingers through it . " Not that stupid walking-on-water stunt again ! It 's just too lame ! " " Promise , " I said to him . " No water-stuff , or you ca n't go . " " I ca n't stay long anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . " " And I suppose you want me to take you . " He shoved his hands into his pockets . " You could just give me the keys to your car . " " Right , " I said and rolled my eyes , " like that 's going to happen . " Even though Jesus was fifteen and had a Learner 's Permit , Mom did n't even let him drive with her . He took too many chances because he kept trusting to a Higher Power . Well , so far that Higher Power had n't ever come through at the crunch , and now two totaled cars later , this particular Jesus was on foot . Harmony made him sit in the back so we could pretend like he was n't there . He was there all right , though . I could feel him praying by the nasty prickle crawling up the back of my neck . " Stop it , nerd , " I said . " You know this is a prayer-free zone . Do n't make me come back there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd better take all the help you can get , " he said . " I told you not to bring him ! " Harmony looked mulish . I parked at the mall , and we went in the north entrance , far away from the fountain and close to the twin Meccas of Abercrombie and Fitch and the Gap , not that any of us were packing money for new clothes . Mom was so stingy , and Harmony 's dad was entirely unreasonable on the subject . He 'd even taken away her credit card after that little incident with the mink halter . Jesus , of course , was hopeless about cash . The minute Mom gave him even a few cents , he frittered it away on beggars or charities . That 's not to say he does n't want a new skateboard or the latest clothes . The Lord would provide , he always said , but it was Mom who had to figure out where those kinds of things would come from , after he 'd blown his allowance . Today , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Jesus was n't getting any cash out of me . Harmony decided to amuse herself by trying on all the cool clothes she could n't afford and headed for the Gap . I told Jesus to sit on a bench outside the store while I got my ears done . Every time he sees the least bit of blood , he 's all " I can heal you ! " Trs embarrassing . Sometimes I could just die . " I have Group in an hour , Bailee , " he reminded me as I went in . Like I could have forgotten . Sometimes I thought his group sessions were all that kept us sane . When I came out with my new studs , he was gone . I swore under my breath , hoping he had n't found a podium somewhere to harass bored shoppers again about loaves and fishes . I swung by the Gap to retrieve Harmony , only to find Jesus there too , carrying her sack . " I thought you did n't have any money , " I told her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disgusting way . " But he did . " " Jesus ? " I could feel my eyebrows puckering . " You 've got to be kidding . " " I found a twenty dollar bill on the floor down at the Food Court , " he said , " so I was looking for a beggar , but there are n't any in the mall , and then I ran into Harmony . " " And I was in serious need of this shirt . " Harmony took the sack out of Jesus 's hand . " It was an awesome act of charity ! " He was staring at her with an expression he usually reserved for the pictures of saints . " We have to go , " I said uneasily . " Jesus has to get to Group . " JESUS 'S GROUP is held every Wednesday afternoon at the YMCA in a room that reeks of chlorine , since it 's next to the pool . I intended just to drop him off , but Harmony wanted to check out the meeting . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of our own model . " Visitors are welcome , " he said , " especially friends and family members , but you 'll have to sit outside the circle and be quiet . " " No way . " I shook my head . That many Jesuses in one place thoroughly creeped me out . " We 'll pick him up when he 's done . " " Oh , come on , Bailee , " Harmony said . " Let 's stay for a few minutes . " Brad-Jesus smiled at her with that beatific radiance they can all muster when they try , and she dragged me over to a row of metal chairs by the wall . More Jesuses filed in , some younger than ours , others older . Each one was greeted with the assumed name he was encouraged by the group to adopt . Our Jesus had chosen Carson . " That 's a seriously cool name , " Harmony whispered to me . " He thinks he 's going to be one of the Fab Five , " I said . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home and lie down . " Gather " round , folks , " Brad-Jesus said with a wave of his arm . " We do n't want to run out of time . " One of the attendees must have been new , because he kept walking around the circle like they were playing Musical Chairs . " Do n't be shy , " Brad-Jesus said . " We 're all Christ here . No need to stand on ceremony . " The newcomer settled next to our Jesus , who moved over to keep an empty space between them . " Now , " Brad-Jesus said , " let 's get the ritual questions out of the way . First , did anyone perform a miracle this week ? " Feet shuffled uncomfortably . Heads hung . " Not even one ? " Brad-Jesus looked disapproving . " Come on , people . We have to keep trying . " Our Jesus raised his hand . " I turned water into wine , " he said . I bolted to my feet . " Did not ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did too ! " " Liar ! " I said . " It was n't even pink ! " " It was white wine , buttface ! " " Now , Carson-Jesus , " Brad-Jesus said mildly . " The Historical Jesus did n't lie or call people names . " " How do you know ? " our Jesus said . His face was red , and his acne stood out like brands . " It 's not like he left a blog ! Besides , I 'm not him . None of us are ! " " You 've got that right . " I crossed my arms and sank back into my seat . " Stupid clones . " " We do n't use the C-word here , " Brad-Jesus said reproachfully . " Look ! " One of the Jesuses pointed at me . " Her ear ! It 's bleeding ! " Damn . I scrambled in my backpack for a tissue . As though they had but one mind between them , the whole circle lurched to their feet . " I can heal it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me ! " " Let me ! " " I want to do it ! " " Uh , Bailee ? " Harmony tugged at my arm . " Maybe we should go ? " I scanned the approaching faces . They looked like they 'd seen a half-price sale at Banana Republic . " Yeah , " I said . " I think you 're right . " We sprinted for the exit , while , behind us , Brad-Jesus exhorted his troops to regain their seats . " Anyone have a revelation this week ? " he said , raising his voice to make himself heard . " Or maybe a precognitive event ? Anyone know when the world 's going to end ? " " I do , " one said , and half of our pursuers stopped to listen . We lost the rest when we ducked through the pool area and left them with their mouths open as they watched the girls " synchronized swim team stand on their heads underwater . Jesuses are so predictable . Of course , our own Jesus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to show my face at Group again , " he said as he threw himself into the back seat of my car . I buckled my seat belt with a click . " I do n't know why not . It looks just like every other face already there . How could they tell it was you ? " " That 's harsh , " he said . " Yeah , " Harmony said , " harsh . " She turned and looked at Jesus over the seat . " I think you 're way more handsome than the rest . " " Give me a break , " I said . " I 'm hungry , " Jesus said . " Let 's stop at McDonald 's . " I pulled out onto the street . A car I had n't noticed screeched its brakes , and I shot it the finger . " I thought you were fasting . " " That was earlier , " he said . " I 'm done now . " I sighed . " Are n't you supposed to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find some tasty pebbles at the park . " " Do n't be dense , " he said . " I want a Big Mac . " " Like you could pay . " I turned the corner on two wheels . " There 's a little left from the twenty he found at the mall , " Harmony said . " We could split one of those combo meals . " He leaned forward . " Supersized ? " So , of course , we had to pull in at Mickey D 's and line up at the counter with all the other dweebs for a ten-block radius . I was n't clogging up my arteries with that stuff . No way , but I had to keep an eye on Jesus , and Harmony was acting funny , like she 'd thawed toward him . That twenty back at the mall had seriously messed up her judgment . She pulled out a five and a handful of change , then gave the money to Jesus while she searched the bottom of her purse for loose quarters . Over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash traps for the unwary , this one purporting to finance camps to teach underprivileged children how to " dress for success " in order to boost their selfesteem . Before I could stop him , he 'd stuffed Harmony 's entire cash reserve through the center slit . Harmony looked up . " Here 's another thirty-five .... " Jesus was beaming . She stared at his empty hands . " What did you do with my money , fool ? " " Nothing he has n't done a hundred times before , " I said . " Come on . Let 's blow this dump . " She could n't get past it though . " You threw it all away ? " " I did n't throw it away ; I donated it to a worthy cause , " he said . " Do n't you know that it 's way easier to smoosh a camel through the eye of a needle than for a rich dude to get into heaven ? " " Barfbag ! " She punched Jesus on the shoulder , then tipped the plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the slot . " Hey , " the manager called from behind the counter , " put that down ! " He was a big guy with the build of a bowling pin . Harmony shook the bin like a terrier with a rat . Two pennies and a metal washer fell out and rolled across the tile floor . " I want my money back ! " " You put it in , sweetcheeks , it stays in . " The manager darted through the counter , then pushed her aside and righted the bin . All the change clinked back to the bottom . Sweat rolled greasily down his cheeks . " Now , do I call the police or are you three leaving ? " Then he squinted , taking a closer look at Jesus . " Another one of those damn holier-than-us boys . I should have known it . Get out of my store ! We only serve real people here ! " Jesus got that bullheaded look that always meant there was going to be trouble . If the first Jesus was half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands full . " Pharisee ! " he said . " Right , the police then . " The manager pulled out his cell phone and started dialing . " No , we 're leaving . " I snagged Jesus by his shirt and dragged him toward the door . " see ? This is us , leaving now . " " Let go ! " Jesus aimed a punch at me that missed . I bet the other Jesus was a wuss when it came to fighting too . I shook him until his braces rattled . " You get arrested again , and Mom will flip . I swear , if you do n't get your ass back in the car right this minute , I 'm going to tell your group about your cherub collection ! " He paled . " You would n't ! " " Try me , " I said with all the deadly coolness I could muster . " Cripes ! " He shook off my hands . " You can be such a bitch sometimes . " " I bet the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " That 's because the real Jesus did n't know you ! " He gave her a look that would have slagged steel , then slunk out to the parking lot . Harmony huffed along behind . " Man , I ca n't take you anywhere ! " I said as he slid into the back seat . We dropped Harmony at her house because she had a date , someone she 'd met through an online dating service , of all places . How smart was that ? Then we went home . Mom was already there , putting away cans of peas from out of a grocery sack . " Hi , kids , " she said as we came through the door , " how was Group today ? " " Bunch of candy-ass whiners , " Jesus said . " I ca n't stand any of them . " " I see , " she said , as though she did , when , take it from me , she never had and never would . On the other hand , she had bought two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number in certain respects . Jesus was hell on bread and do n't even get me started on him and fish . " I 'm going to my niche , " Jesus said and stomped out of the room . " Did something happen at Group ? " Mom asked . " He seems grouchier than usual . " " How can you tell ? " I said under my breath as I helped empty the grocery sacks . " Bailee , " she said , " we have to be patient with Jesus . It 's hard on him . He has a lot to live up to , and he did n't ask to be here . " " Yeah , well , I did n't ask for him to be here either , " I said . " I know , " she said , putting an arm around me , " but it will all come out right in the end . We just have to hold on until it does . " " Does that include Dad ? " I asked . " Is he out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't have an answer for that . MOM HAD gone to bed , and I was just finishing my trig problems about midnight , when Jesus slunk through the kitchen , all tricked out in black leather pants and a black T-shirt . I put the pencil down on the table with an irritated click . " Just where do you think you 're going ? " " None of your business , " he said . " Go back to your stupid ho-work . " " Oh , that 's so funny , " I said . " see me not laughing . " He did n't answer , just unlocked the door and disappeared into the night . Great , I thought , just great . When he was missing in the morning , Mom would blame me . I grabbed my keys and followed . Half a block ahead , he stalked down the sidewalk without looking over his shoulder . I tracked him to a grocery store parking lot six blocks away , then hung back behind a telephone pole across the street and observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though the store had been closed for hours . More Jesuses had gathered than I 'd ever seen in one place before , at least thirty , all milling and laughing , talking just like regular people . Most of them were dressed in black leather , and ours blended right in . He actually looked happy . I thought I saw a girl in the middle of the crowd , but all the rest were clones . The hair stood up on the back of my neck when I realized they each wore a cross on a chain around their necks or in their ears . Some of the crosses were even jeweled and glittered under the street lights . That was seriously creepy . I mean , if I were a Jesus , the last thing I 'd want to see would be a stupid cross . " All right , let 's get started ! " one of them yelled over the general din , and the conversation died away . " Who 's got the test case ? " " Here she is , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had spiky black hair just like Harmony . " Let go ! " she said in a high , squeaky voice , and I realized it was Harmony , dressed in her tightest , shortest black dress . My hands tightened on the telephone pole . What was she doing mixed up with this bunch ? She did n't even like OUT Jesus . She was wearing a ton of purple eyeshadow , too . " Where 's the band ? " she said , gazing around in dismay . " So , go ahead and kill her , " a tall older Jesus said . He gazed down at his spread fingers . " I feel like I can really do it tonight . " " Everybody gets a turn , " another Jesus said . He was wearing red leather and his cross was studded with rubies . " What do you mean , " kill ? ' " Harmony tugged the clingy black skirt down over her hips . " You said we were going to a rave . " A nasty snicker ran through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " A Jesus rave ! " They all laughed louder . " I 'm going home ! " I could hear tears in Harmony 's voice . " You all are just as stupid as I thought ! " " Come on , guys , " the red-leather guy said . " We ca n't raise her unless she 's dead first . Let 's get it done ! " Harmony tried to push through the crowd , but several Jesuses caught her arms . I closed my eyes and tried to think . The best bet would be to call 911 , but I 'd left my cell phone at home to recharge . And if I took the time to go back , it would be too late before the police got here . Think , Bailee , think ! I told myself . You 've lived with a Jesus practically your whole life . Come up with something ! Harmony shrieked , and I bolted across the street . " Oh , this is so brave , yeah , real macho ! " I said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers will just love this . " " Another candidate , " Red-Leather said . " This is shaping up to be a bountiful night . " Harmony looked up at me from the ground , mascara running down her cheeks . Someone had stuffed a souvenir Vatican bandana in her mouth . " The police are on their way , " I said as a knot of grinning Jesuses advanced on me . " I just thought you studs might like to know . " " Go home , Bailee ! " It was our Jesus , standing off to one side . " No one wants you here . " " Yeah , not even me , " I said . I caught and held his gaze . " Go home yourself . " " This is important stuff , " he said . " Do n't meddle in what you ca n't understand . " " All those dead kittens you used to drag in , " I said . " They did n't get dead by themselves , did they ? " I bent down and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wrists were tied with shoelaces . The mob of Jesuses pressed in . " No , " he said , hands jammed into his pockets . He looked sullen . " That 's part of the initiation . " " Just like Harmony here ? " I wrenched at the shoelaces but they were knotted too tight . Dammit , I needed a knife . " We have to practice , stupid , " he said , " or we 'll never get it right . " " Well , practice on something else , " I said . " If Mom hears about this , you 'll be grounded for life ! " I took Harmony by the arm . " We 're leaving . " " You 're not going anywhere , " Red-Leather said . All the years of trying to cope with a Jesus hit critical mass inside my brain . I 'd had it with the whole lot , all these weirdos trying to live up to the historical Jesus , which was stupid , because who knew really what He 'd done , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my face , Mr. I'm-SoHoly , or I 'll rip you a new one ! " Red-Leather stepped back , surprised . " You 're idiots , " I said , " all of you ! Always trying to be someone else instead of who you really are ! I 'm sick of all of you ! " " Two deaths instead of one ! " someone in the back shouted . " Lots more practice tonight ! " The crowd laughed and surged forward . I shuddered . " Come on , Harmony , " I said under my breath . " Let 's get out of here . " She swayed against me , too terrified to move . " Look ! " a voice cried from the back . " Over there ! A burning bush ! " The horde of Jesuses hesitated . " No , wait ! " the voice called again . " I was wrong . By all that 's holy , it 's two burning bushes ! " They turned and saw smoke rising greasily from a pair of forsythia bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot . " Dad ! " one of them cried , then they were all running toward the bushes , yelling demands . Except for one Jesus in black leather pants and braces , and sporting a bad case of acne . Left behind , he watched his fellow clones gather around the two fires , hopping up and down , gesticulating and laughing . " Clueless , the whole lot of them , " he said and stuffed the book of matches back into his pocket . It took a Jesus to know how to get to the rest , I guess . " Are you coming home ? " I said . He cut the shoelaces binding Harmony 's hands with his pocketknife . " Yeah , " he said , " might as well . " Supporting Harmony between us , we hurried across the street and around the corner before the Jesuses noticed their burning bushes were strangely incommunicado . " You know those dead kittens ? " he said as we walked in and out of the pools of light from the street lamps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , after they were already dead , " he said . " I know , " I said , and all along I really had . I called the police when we got back to the house and told them what had happened . Harmony 's father tried to press charges , but the police lineup the next day was a joke . She 'd been lured to the gang meeting by a Jesus she 'd met online , but it was n't Red-Leather , and who could tell the rest apart ? Despite the gang 's boasts about " practicing , " the police had no unsolved disappearances on the books within the last six months , so it was most likely just big talk . We had to be satisfied with breaking up the Jesus gang . Later , though , I did hear they formed a touch football league for the whole lot as a more appropriate outlet for their aggressive feelings . Mom grounded our Jesus , of course , but only for a month , not too bad , considering his part in the affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , and he had . I could n't argue with that . She says he needs to get out of his living room niche more and is making him attend that woodworking class down at Vo-Tech . It 's been two weeks , and he 's actually passing , so who says there are n't any real miracles anymore ? As for me , I 'm trying to cut him a bit of slack . I guess we all get the Jesus we deserve . And it could have been worse . Mom might have been able to contract for a Virgin Mary instead .
