NFL PLAYOFFS PREVIEW Headnote Emerging from a regular season in which nothing was certain , questions abound in this year 's playoffs field // The offense functions methodically but efficiently . The defense yields points and running yards grudgingly . The team minimizes its mistakes . No doubt , the Bears are built for playing January football in Chicago , where the cold wind blowing off Lake Michigan and into Soldier Field can feel like an icicle slicing through your rib cage . But they are n't equipped for a track meet against the top-seeded Rams in a dome in St. Louis , where the NFC championship game seems destined to be played . Each of the NFUs playoff teams faces a critical concern heading into the postseason , a question whose answer will largely determine how long that team will dance . For the Bears , the query is : How can they beat the Rams , who never ease up on the throttle ? They ca n't if they try to get into a score-fest . " I give ( Bears offensive coordinator ) John Shoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of pro personnel . " He 's done a heck of a job taking the personnel he 's been given and making the best of it . But if he came out trying to run the Rams ' offense , you 'd look at him like he did n't know what he was doing . " The Bears do n't have a quick-strike offense . It revolves mainly around rookie running back Anthony Thomas and a dink-and-dunk passing attack . Marty Booker is the only playmaking wide receiver on whom quarterback Jim Miller can rely consistently . Rookie David Terrell still struggles running some routes , Dez White stalled after a strong start , and DWayne Bates has emerged only recently . The receivers are big and physical-the 6-3 Terrell , 6-2 Bates , 6-0 White and 5-11 Booker all are at least 215 pounds-and that gives them a matchup advantage against smaller defensive backs . They also are good blockers on running plays . They are particularly effective when they line up in a bunch formation ( three receivers grouped tightly on one side ) . From that alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the receivers blocking a defender and one of the offensive tackles , either 6-7 James " Big Cat " Williams or 6-4 Blake Brockermeyer , pulls out to lead Thomas or James Allen . If the offense takes time off the clock , and if the defense allows no big plays and forces some turnovers , and if the game is close in the fourth quarter and the Rams go into a conservative mode , maybe the Bears can compete . But there are too many ifs to expect them to win . The Bears are not the only playoff team with uncertainties . Will the Rams give it away ? They have the NFL 's past two MVPs ( quarterback Kurt Warner , 1999 , and running back Marshall Faulk , 2000 ) , a plethora of receivers , the best defense in the NFC and home-field advantage . It looks like an invincible combination . Photograph When the Bears go to the air , their quarterback has few dependable receiving options outside of Booker ( 86 ) . In Green Bay , Favre ( 4 ) similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bucs truly are to challenge for the NFC title , they will need some big plays in the postseason from Owens ( 81 ) and Dunn ( 28 ) . Photograph // In their only two losses this season , both at home , the Rams imploded . They had eight turnovers against the Saints on October 28 and five against the Buccaneers on November 26 . But they have taken measures to improve their ball security , including replacing erratic punt returner Az-Zahir Hakim with Dre ' Bly . Another potential chink would be if Warner reinjured his thumb and was unable to grip the ball tightly . That could lead to some errant passes and , possibly , interceptions . But ask the question of any NFL expert or an 8-ball , and the answer will be the same : Can the Rams be beaten ? " Signs point to no . " " The Rams are in a class by themselves " says an NFL pro personnel director . " There 's nobody in the NFC who can beat them . If there 's no turnovers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if the other team scores 28 points ? The Rams are going to score 42 . " Will Tom Brady 's star continue to side In the postseason ? One reason for Brady 's success is that the wunderkind quarterback has n't had to carry the Patriots ' offense on his shoulders . Running back Antowain Smith has rushed for 1,157 yards and 12 touchdowns . If the Patriots can maintain a balanced attack and Brady gets sufficient protection , he will have time to stand in the pocket , diagnose defenses and find open receivers such as Troy Brown ( 101 catches for 1,199 yards and five TDs ) . Another element in New England 's arsenal is coach Bill Belichick 's proficiency at designing potent defensive schemes . Brady , Smith and Belichick make the surprising Patriots a legitimate threat to be the AFC 's Super Bowl representative . Can the Packers ' count on any of their wide receivers ? Antonio Freeman has lost his speed , quickness and ability to separate from defensive backs . Bill Schroeder has speed , but he ca n't get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does n't get a lot of yards after the catch . Corey Bradford does one thing : go deep . If the receivers ca n't make plays , opponents will focus on stopping running back Ahman Green and shut down the Green Bay offense . The Titans crowded the line and held Green to nine yards on nine carries in a 26-20 win on December 16 . Two weeks later , the Vikings limited Green to 31 yards on 16 carries . Quarterback Brett Favre has tried to buy his receivers time to get open by running more sprintouts and bootlegs . Favre sometimes is most dangerous when he does that . But the Packers ca n't thrive on a steady diet of improvisation . Before the game in Tennessee , Favre offered a telling revelation to Brian Baldinger , an NFL analyst for Fox and Sporting News Radio . " He told me that he has n't had a guy who 's wanted the ball in a big spot since Sterling Sharpe was there , " says Baldinger . Sharpe 's last season was 1994 . Can the 49ers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before he caught touchdown passes of 60 and 56 yards last week in New Orleans , Owens had a combined 16 receptions for 254 yards and one TD in his previous four games . In the first 11 games , he averaged 6.6 catches and 98.8 yards and scored 13 touchdowns . The recent falloff was due to two developments . Quarterback Jeff Garcia suffered injured ribs and the 49ers tried to protect him by throwing fewer passes and relying on their capable running attack . And the Rams and Cowboys did a good job of taking away Owens in two late-season games that San Francisco lost . Now that Garcia 's health has improved , look for Owens to play a starring role again . Some NFL scouts think the best way to stop Owens is to get up in his face at the line of scrimmage and knock him off his route . The 49ers counter by lining up Owens in different spots or sending him in motion-anything to keep him from being a stationary target . Even when a defender tries to jam him at the line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle . Do the Raiders need to turn back the clock on offense ? Last year , Oakland ranked No. 1 in the NFL in rushing , with 2,470 yards on 520 carries . This season , the Raiders ran 70 fewer times and gained 816 fewer yards . With the additions of running back Charlie Garner and wide receiver Jerry Rice , they accented the short , controlled passing game in their West Coast offense . While Garner has been both the leading rusher and a receiving threat , Tyrone Wheatley ( 1,046 rushing yards last year ) almost has been phased out . But Oakland might have to use Wheatley more in the postseason , if for no other reason than to allow quarterback Rich Gannon 's play-action to open up receiving room for Rice and Tim Brown . More troubling may be an apparent loss of momentum . The Raiders , once 8-2 , lost four of their final six games . Perhaps they peaked too soon . " It looks like they lost their edge , " says Craig James , an NFL analyst for CBS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be building a team instead of having it built , and maybe they built their team too soon . " What will happen to the Bucs if Keyshawn Johnson and Warrick Dunn ca n't make plays ? The Bucs ca n't win on defense alone . If Johnson and Dunn do n't step up , the Bucs will quickly step aside . Clyde Christensen , the team 's third offensive coordinator in the last three years , made it his mandate this season to get the ball into the hands of his playmakers . To a certain extent , he has done that . Johnson has been terrific between the goal lines ( 106 receptions for 1,266 yards ) , but he has scored only one touchdown . Johnson is a good intermediate receiver , but he 's not an explosive threat to beat you deep . And defenses get more physical with Johnson inside the red zone , where he sees a lot of double coverage . Despite being hampered by a sprained foot for much of the season , Dunn has scored six touchdowns and has about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucs have tried to divide the rushing load between Dunn and Mike Alstott , but it has n't been an effective plan . The Bucs ' best strategy would be to make Alstott the primary running back and put rookie fullback Jameel Cook in the backfield with him . Dunn is more of a big-play threat when he lines up in the slot or splits out wide as a receiver . Can the Dolphins ' offensive line produce enough room for the running game to be productive ? Lamar Smith , who had a breakout season in 2000 ( 1,139 rushing yards ) , was averaging only 2.9 yards per carry this season before he broke loose for 158 yards on 30 carries against the Bills last Sunday . But not even Ricky Williams could prosper behind this line , ravaged by injuries and inconsistent play . The Dolphins lost projected left tackle Brent Smith on the first day of training camp and Marcus Spriggs , Smith 's replacement , in the season opener-both to knee injuries . Left guard Mark Dixon suffered a fractured fibula in the loth game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , has fallen off . As a result , Smith often hesitates when he gets to the line of scrimmage and fails to get up a head of steam . Rookie Travis Minor has more speed , but at 5-10 , 194 pounds , he 's not built to run between the tackles . If the line ca n't open holes , it wo n't matter whether Smith or Minor carries the ball . The Dolphins ' postseason will be short-lived . How will the Eagles fill Hollis Thomas ' vacancy in their defensive line ? Thomas , whose season ended when his previously injured foot broke during pregame introductions on December 30 , was a 6-0 , 330-pound anchor at defensive tackle who played mostly on running downs . He had great leverage and rarely got knocked off his feet . " It 's big , " defensive coordinator Jim Johnson says of the loss of Thomas . " He was probably our best run defender . " Paul Grasmanis , who had been the nickel defensive tackle , will replace Thomas . Grasmanis is not quite as big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and athleticism . Grasmanis and Corey Simon probably will start , and Brandon Whiting will be a swingman between end and tackle . Johnson is hoping that second-year tackle Darwin Walker , who has been used sparingly and usually in short-yardage situations , also will contribute . With Thomas , the Eagles ' run defense was only average . Without him , the middle of the line wore down in the second half of a 24-21 victory over the Giants on December 30 . Will Kris Brown 's leg be an Achilles ' heel for the Steelers ? The Steelers are the AFCs No. 1 seed . They have both the No. 1 rushing offense and the No. 1 rushing defense in the NFL . Quarterback Kordell Stewart has resurrected his career under the guidance of first-year offensive coordinator Mike Malarkey . If there 's cause for concern , it 's special teams . Kicker Kris Brown had made only 14 of 24 field-goal attempts at Heinz Field , where the Steelers will play all their games during the playoffs leading up to the Super Bowl . In the four games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 11 tries plus three extra points . In addition , the Steelers have allowed three punts and one field-goal attempt to be blocked . Pittsburgh likely will be involved in some close games . If the outcome hangs on the leg of Brown , there will be some nervous stomachs in Pittsburgh  --  both in the stands and on the Steelers ' sideline .
