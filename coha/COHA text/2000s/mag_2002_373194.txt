When it comes to cracking down on corporate crime , retribution seems to be the order of the day in Washington . Not long after Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill spoke of hanging wayward CEOs from the highest tree , President Bush announced the formation of a " financial-crimes SWAT team . " Unfortunately , the proposals most likely to pass into law have more bark than bite . Here 's a look at some solutions that are more than just tough talk . <P> 1 . MORE ORANGE JUMPSUITS <P> President Bush last week called for doubling the maximum prison term for mail and wire fraud to 10 years . But the problem is n't the length of the sentence handed down for corporate malfeasance ; it 's winning a criminal conviction in the first place . Financial misdeeds are often difficult to explain to juries , and proving intent is even harder . More money for investigators would help , but the new $100 million that Bush pledged for the Securities and Exchange Commission is not nearly enough for the underfunded agency . <P> There is similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont would make it a felony to defraud shareholders  --  making it easier to prosecute executives  --  and also provide more protection to whistle-blowers . Another proposed law would make CEOs liable for the accuracy of their firm 's financial statements , a measure supported by nearly 90% of those surveyed in a new TIME/CNN poll . <P> 2 . GET RID OF PET-ROCK BOARDS <P> Even with the improvements of recent years , too many corporate boards of directors still serve as little more than puppets of management . Bush only briefly touched on this in his speech , calling for a majority of each board  --  and for all members of its audit , nominating and compensation committees  --  to be " truly independent " and to " ask tough questions . " But this should be spelled out further . Independent should mean more than someone who does n't work for the company ; it should exclude anyone who has a consulting gig or supplier deal or who has recently left the company  --  as the New York Stock Exchange recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves thin on five or 10 boards at a time . They should be subject to 10-year term limits and annual elections . The terms should not be staggered , so shareholders can throw out all board members at once if they wish . Companies should be required to give shareholders election materials about rival candidates ; as it stands , small investors who want to wage upstart campaigns do n't stand a chance . <P> To avoid getting too cozy with management , directors need to meet regularly by themselves and with auditors without any of the company 's top executives present . They should appoint a lead independent director to balance the power of  --  or even serve as  --  the chairman , who these days too often happens to be the CEO . ( That should not be allowed . ) Finally , directors should be paid primarily with long-term grants of stock , rather than collect a check for showing up occasionally . At AutoZone , a $5 billion-a-year parts-supermarket chain , each board member must invest at least $100,000 in company stock within three years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
