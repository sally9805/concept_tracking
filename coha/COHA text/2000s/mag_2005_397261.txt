Section : Special Report : America 's Best Leaders MEG WHITMAN PRESIDENT AND CEO EBAY <p> Meg Whitman leads by not leading , bosses by not bossing , and manages by not managing . <p> And yet the 49-year-old CEO of eBay presides over a company that has been described as growing faster in its first decade than any other enterprise in the history of capitalism . Since Whitman joined eBay in early 1998 , its revenue has exploded  --  from about $5.7 million to an expected $4.3 billion this year . The first global online marketplace to connect buyers and sellers 24-7 , eBay conducts more transactions every day than the Nasdaq Stock Market . It started out as a quaint digital auctioneer of collectibles like Pez dispensers , but this year Whitman 's company will enable the sale of over $40 billion worth of cars , clothing , and computers . <p> Guided by Whitman , eBay is redefining the bedrock business principles , including leadership , that have anchored successful corporations since the industrial revolution . In the process , Whitman has created a radically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective intelligence and enthusiasm of its 157 million customers determine and drive the daily actions of its 9,300 employees . <p> Fair winds . This highly fragmented and participatory business model requires a new kind of corporate leader , one who , like Whitman , keeps a steady hand on the tiller rather than gripping and pulling hard on the levers of power . <p> That means subtly steering and influencing relationships  --  instead of controlling them  --  to generate financial returns . It means working from a cube , not a corner office , and conversing , not commanding . It means asking questions , as opposed to providing answers , and then sharing what 's been learned . It means building continual consensus and earning trust through transparency . Finally , it means understanding that bottom-line success often stems from experimenting and failing  --  or from doing nothing when bold action seems desperately needed . <p> " It 's different from traditional leadership , " says Whitman . " It 's usually : What does the center want to do ? It 's command and control . At eBay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are truly in partnership with the community of users . The key is connecting employees and customers in two-way communication . We call it ' The Power of All of Us . ' " <p> Adds Yochai Benkler , a Yale Law School professor who studies the economics of networks : " The new corporate leader weaves a texture out of the threads flowing from his or her company 's community . This is not an architect imposing his or her blueprint on everyone . " <p> Whitman has woven her tapestry from three basic and counterintuitive strands . <p> First , she realizes she ca n't control eBay 's community of buyers and sellers , because they do n't report to her and if they 're dissatisfied , they do n't have to show up for " work . " " It 's not our baseball card , " says Tom Tierney , an eBay director and chairman of Bridgespan Group , a nonprofit consulting firm . " We 're not owners . " <p> Whitman 's second leadership strand  --  people are basically good , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former software engineer who founded eBay . It was Omidyar who came up with eBay 's feedback system , which allows buyers and sellers , true strangers , to evaluate each other based on the quality of their dealings . Says Whitman : " Our company is built and managed on validation . Where else can you wake up and see how much you are liked each day ? " <p> The third leadership strand is perhaps the hardest to internalize , but Whitman has : Do n't assume you know more than the marketplace or community  --  because you do n't . Unlike Wall Street bond traders who try to outguess and outsmart the market , Whitman listens and learns to formulate the right questions ; then she influences others on her team so they can come up with the right answers . " You are constantly taking in new information , " says Whitman , " constantly changing the prism through which you view your business . " Adds Tierney : " CEO s today have to be receivers rather than transmitters . It 's a discovery process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . Whitman has demonstrated leadership through learning by making several trips to China , listening and trying to understand how the country actually works . Her time on the ground was crucial . China 's 100 million Internet users are second only to those in the United States . <p> Whitman also uses her board of directors as a think tank , a resource to help identify key questions that affect eBay 's fortunes . And she invites her senior staff to board meetings to make sure they are full participants . <p> Because eBay is so new , Whitman 's education often happens at the same time a market unfolds and reveals itself . " Sometimes , " says Bill Cobb , president of eBay North America , " it feels like we 're hurtling through space . " When eBay users wanted to buy and sell cars online , Whitman and her team worried about risk , trust , and safety . " There 's a big difference between a $40 collectible and a $40,000 car , " says Whitman . " We had a fair amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " <p> But they did it . Recognizing that the community knows what it wants , the company created a separate website to see how this marketplace would sort itself out . It was n't clean or simple at first , and Whitman and her managers constantly revised the site to solve problems as they came up . " It would have been tough to anticipate all the issues , so we went to market and revved on the fly , " explains Whitman . " Sometimes you are delighted , sometimes you are surprised , and sometimes you are horrified . What 's the worst thing that can happen ? You fail . " <p> In this case , eBay hardly failed . More than 1 million cars and more than 50 million parts and accessories have been sold on the company 's website since 2000 . <p> Whitman 's moves do n't always win acclaim . After eBay acquired the Internet-telephone company Skype ( which has yet to show a profit ) in September for $2.6 billion , eBay 's stock price sagged , and commentators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " kind of dumb . " Yet the shares soon righted themselves , as the market appears to be giving Whitman the benefit of the doubt based on her track record . <p> Sitting still . Vulnerability , exposure , and a willingness to just go with the flow are essential components of modern corporate leadership . But so , too , is a willingness to embrace inaction  --  even when inertia is pulling in the opposite direction . Several years ago , for instance , Whitman was sitting with a fully priced offer from Yahoo ! that would have integrated eBay into its Internet cousin . Despite the attractive financial proposal , the CEO listened hard and recognized that the eBay community of users would not be served well by a merger . She broke off negotiations , and eBay and its buyers and sellers preserved their independent and sometimes rambunctious network . <p> " It would have been simple to make the easy but wrong decision . Meg chose the harder right decision , " says Anthony Noto , Internet analyst at Goldman Sachs , which has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a democratic state , and it could have been corrupted by Yahoo ! " <p> It 's unclear whether great leaders are born or bred , and , in Whitman 's case , the mystery continues . She began her career in brand management at Procter &; Gamble , where she learned that the customer always comes first . Later , as a consultant for business management firm Bain , she worked in an environment that was relatively decentralized ; partners had independence , and being part of the firm required collaboration , not control . <p> Whitman also changed jobs fairly frequently , which forced her to stay open . Moving from P &G; to Bain to Disney to Stride Rite to FTD to Hasbro to eBay , she was often a new person in complex environments . She did n't always have authority and had to work hard to quickly earn the respect of new colleagues . She had to get things done in places where she was not well known or well established . And this required listening , learning , collaboration , and building relationships based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need " strategic agility " to lead today . She credits Frank Wells , Disney 's late president and chief operating officer , for teaching her the importance of executive humility and cites Omidyar for showing her corporate flexibility . <p> She may be nurturing , but nobody mistakes Whitman 's sensitivity for weakness . In fact , she is a strong believer in maintaining boundaries . That 's why she banned the sale of weapons on eBay 's site . " Meg is a hybrid , and that 's the model for the future , " says Tierney : " a decisive general manager combined with an open-minded influencer . " <p> Most CEO s today do n't measure up to those standards . And most companies are n't as organically run as eBay  --  especially those saddled with heavy capital investment needs that prevent nimble moves and those that have n't yet invested fully in the Internet . <p> But it is still early days in the current corporate revolution , which is quietly fomenting a culture of selfless management in a growing number of enterprises . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction , this managerial upheaval promises more than a series of corner-office coups . Indeed , if there were more Meg Whitmans sitting in cubes today , companies might have an easier time attracting and retaining talented performers who can drive revenue and profits  --  as well as America 's pre-eminent knowledge-based economy . <p> BORN : Aug. 4 , 1956 <p> EDUCATION : B.A. , Princeton University ; M.B.A. , Harvard University <p> FAMILY : Married , two children <p> CAREER HIGHLIGHTS : President and CEO of eBay since 1998 ; president of Florists Transworld Delivery ( FTD ) , 1995-97 ; named the most powerful woman in American business by FORTUNE , 2004 <p> ON LEADERSHIP : Executive leadership is a span of influence , not of control . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By William Meyers <p>
