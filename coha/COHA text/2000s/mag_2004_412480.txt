Despite investors ' worries , this bull looks as though it has a lot further to run // The bull market celebrated its first birthday on March 11 , and that anniversary should be cause for widespread happiness . But for many investors , a tinge of anxiety has undercut both their enthusiasm about recent profits and their expectations of future gains . Many stockholders are still feeling the aftershocks of the worst bear market in more than 20 years . And while the psychological impact of the recent downturn may be only subconscious , it discourages many people from pursuing the smartest stock strategies . Moreover , investor unease seems to have grown since the stock market began treading water after more than nine months of strong gains . * In fact , though , there 's nothing really wrong-either with the economy or with the market . Economic growth was about average for 2003 as a whole and picked up in the second half . This year , growth is projected to run even faster , at a rate of 4% to 5% . Earnings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four years from 1998 through 2001 and then rose less than 13% in both 2002 and 2003 . This year and next , by contrast , corporate profits should gain more than 20% . Inflation and interest rates are no threat-they 're close to their lowest levels in decades . Why , then , are so many investors feeling queasy ? In part , it 's because the last bear market was so awful that birthday celebrations for the recovery seem like tempting fate . The slump that ended in late 2002 lasted almost three years , during which the S &P; 500 plummeted 40% . After this drop , stock prices bumped along for another nine months , hitting bottom again in March 2003 . So not only was the decline substantial , it also lasted far , far longer than a typical bear market . There has n't been such a protracted slump , in fact , since the early 1980s . So for many investors-who were used to fast comebacks like the one after the 1987 crash and the one after the 1990 recession-the most recent bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investors seem to be having a hard time believing that the current rebound is real , even though historical patterns are quite encouraging . Essentially , shareholders have two basic worries-that the recovery will falter and that stock prices have run up so fast that they are vulnerable to a big pullback . The first concern has a little truth behind it . Despite the generally bright economic outlook , there are some soft spots . The one that seems most disconcerting is the disappointing rate of job creation . From its peak in June 2003 , the unemployment rate has come down only 0.7 percentage points to 5.6% . This slow reduction in joblessness is unfortunate , but it does n't mean that the recovery is stalling . Job creation always lags at major economic turning points , especially when productivity is strong and businesses can ramp up output for a while without hiring additional workers . But as long as unemployment is coming down , whatever the speed , it should n't pose a threat to the recovery . Investors ' second concern-that stocks have run up too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly simplistic view of price/earnings ratios . It 's true that the S &P; 500 is now trading at a P/E above 20 , based on estimated earnings for 2004 . And the historical average P/E for the index is only 16 . But that does n't necessarily mean stock prices are due for a 20% pullback . A more sophisticated analysis leads to quite a different conclusion . Most stock valuation models compare the stream of earnings or dividends that stocks are expected to generate with the alternative returns offered by high-quality bonds , which have the advantage of being more predictable . These models indicate that blue chips are at least 10% below fair valuation . How can stocks be undervalued when their P/Es are higher than the historical average ? There 's an explanation : Bond yields are so low right now that the potential returns offered by stocks look unusually attractive by comparison . There is a catch , however . A rise of less dian one percentage point in long-term bond yields would erase the undervaluation that now exists for stocks . I do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep up in the course of an economic recovery . The real conclusion of this debate is that it 's pointless to spend too much time on such calculations . They work best on analysts ' computer spreadsheets and provide little guidance in the real world . And in any event , no one can reliably predict temporary market setbacks . What counts is the long-term outlook , based on historical data . One of die few patterns that hold up fairly consistently is that full-fledged bear markets are normally followed by sizable rebounds . If , for example , the S &P; 500 falls more than 20% over the space of nine months or so , that index is likely to gain at least 80% over two years or longer once a sustainable recovery finally takes hold . Moreover , when such a bull market begins , it generally continues until the Federal Reserve raises interest rates at least three times in succession . The Fed normally hikes rates that much when the economy is clearly overextended or inflation is on its way . But so far , neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates even once . BALANCING A PORTFOLIO At this point in the recovery , there 's a compelling case for adding money to stocks , especially if you sold a lot during the protracted bear market . And there are two basic principles of portfolio management that will help maximize your returns as this yearling bull market grows to maturity . First , build your portfolio around a core of high-quality growth stocks . Second , broaden your stock mix as much as possible . Stock market theoreticians endlessly debate how many stocks you need to be fully diversified . One side says you need more than 35 ; the other says you can get away with as few as eight . It 's true that you need a very large number of stocks to eliminate all diversifiable risk ( as unnecessary volatility is called ) . But you can get rid of a lot of it with fewer than 10 stocks , as long as they are as varied as possible . The simplest way to do this is to make sure that each stock you buy is in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks suitable for conservative , long-term growth investors appears on the preceding-page . But obviously , it makes the most sense to put together a diverse mix of stocks with superior earnings growth and build out from there , adding companies that provide diversification as well as stocks that are especially timely . Here 's a look at choices in each of those groups . You do n't need to buy them all ; just choose the ones that best complement what you already own . I 'll devote more space to companies that are less widely known ; those that I 've written about many times before will get briefer mentions . CORE GROWTH STOCKS Over the long term , stocks with aboveaverage rates of earnings growth are most likely to outperform the broad market . Sometimes it 's possible to find a superior stock in a slow-growing industry , but most potential market beaters are in industries that represent the fastest-growing parts of the economy . Such star growth stocks are widely recognized , so I 'll just quickly tick them off . Citigroup is a favorite pick among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pfizer is a pharmaceutical powerhouse . Procter &; Gamble is a superb collection of widely recognized consumer brands . Viacom is the media giant with the fewest complications . Two companies I recommended in January 's " Forecast 2004 " have narrowly focused businesses that would enrich a mix of growth stocks . First Data provides money transfers through Western Union , as well as credit- and debit-card transaction processing . The company is in the process of completing its acquisition of Concord , which operates STAR , the largest ATM and PIN debit network . Staples is a leading office-supply retail chain . The company is renovating stores , adding more profitable house brands and focusing more on small business customers . Neither stock has moved more than a couple of dollars since the January issue . DIVERSIFICATION CHOICES Once you have assembled your core growth holdings , you should look for other choices that will fill gaps in your portfolio . My list of 70 stocks includes companies that may not have standout growth rates but can provide additional diversification because they are linked to specific economic sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because their performance depends chiefly on the level of oil prices . As a result , in the event that oil prices rise , these two stocks would offer valuable inflation protection . Boeing and United Technologies have important franchises that will benefit greatly once the aerospace cycle , which is currently depressed , turns up again . Gannett , the publisher of USA Today and a host of local newspapers , should be a prime beneficiary as advertising comes back . Ad spending typically moves on a different timetable from the overall economy , often with a lag . TIMELY ADDITIONS Specific economic circumstances shine a spotlight on other stocks that are less well known . Here are three that score well for value and timeliness . Baxter International . A top maker of medical equipment , Baxter operates in three major areas : drug-delivery systems , blood collection and dialysis . Half of its sales come from overseas . I recommended the stock as a potential turnaround this past August because the share price was depressed as a result of sluggish earnings growth . Since then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose 47% in the most recent quarter , but the company has warned that 2004 earnings may be below expectations . Nonetheless , the company 's profit trends are expected to improve , and the 1.9% dividend is a further attraction . The shares look cheap at 16.4 times estimated 2004 earnings . Harley-Davidson . The dominant U.S. motorcycle producer with a passionate following both here and abroad , Harley is a prime beneficiary of the falling U.S. currency . With the dollar at long-term lows against both the euro and the yen , Harley sales are up strongly in Europe and Japan . The company 's latest quarter was a winner , with earnings gains of 21% . That marks Harley 's 18th straight year of record results . Over the next five years , earnings are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 17% . The $54 stock trades at a 19.3 P/E . Union Pacific . Transportation stocks often lag an upturn in industrials . But as of last fall , the recovery finally started boosting business for the largest U.S. railroad . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; overall , the railroad plans $2 billion in capital spending this year . Earnings gains have been strong for the past couple of quarters , and Union Pacific recently raised its dividend 30% , giving the $64 stock a 1.9% yield . With a projected annual total return of more than 13% , Union Pacific trades at less than a 14 P/E .
