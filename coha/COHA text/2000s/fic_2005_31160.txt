Introduction Leonard Wolf , my father , is a wild old visionary poet . He believes that the heart 's creative wisdom has a more important message than anything else , and that our task in life is to realize that message . Leonard has spent a lifetime identifying his own heart 's desires , and it shows in the things that surround him . He has twenty ancient typewriters . He has a kukri knife , used to behead bullocks in a single stroke . He has an elaborate filigreed toiletry set used to remove the earwax of a Persian caliph . He has driftwood in piles , and heaps of seaworn glass in bushel baskets lying around the house . He has a box of horseshoe nails " because horseshoe nails are intrinsically beautiful . " Those are all part of his heart 's desires because they are symbols of a life of adventure and discovery . Among the things he does not have : current maps for a given destination . Like most men , he does not wish to ask directions , so my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently biting our tongues in the backseat while he navigates by memories of foliage and lyrical years-old impressions of passing landmarks . ( " Can the Golden Gate Bridge be on the right ? When did that happen ? " ) However , he happily brought home from one trip a collection of silk paratroopers ' maps dating from World War II , which show roads and boundaries of countries that no longer exist . He gave them out as useful gifts . The idea is that you keep the silk map handy in your breast pocket as you are parachuting into , say , Prussia , so you can find your way around once you hit the ground . My father does not have a cell phone or a personal organizer . He is the only personin America who kept the impossible-to-remember generic e-mail address that AOL assigned him . I have been trying to explain to him the principle of compound interest for my entire adult life . He overlooks these details because they have nothing to do with what he thinks really matters . One of his greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco when we were children , is a set of medieval Arabian astrolabes . They are crusted over with what looks like recent antiquing , and are probably mass-produced . He needs them because Chaucer used an astrolabe . Most of these were bought in North African bazaars for exorbitant prices that my father , who is far from wealthy , was always glad to pay . It makes him happier to pay more for something he can believe is a medieval astrolabe than it does to pay less for what he must then acknowledge is probably not a medieval astrolabe . The very words " medieval astrolabe , " and the way they flow off the tongue , add to the objects ' value . North African souk dealers see him coming from miles away , and when they part , they do so , after many glasses of sweetened mint tea , as the dearest of friends . ( " How do you know they are not real ? " he wrote in a testy hand upon reading this . ) Why did Leonard accumulate a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a ship : " You live in Manhattan , " someone might say . " It 's surrounded by water , " he will point out . Why , he feels , should you accept that your life will never call upon you to navigate by the stars ? How sad would that be ? My dad is still a very handsome man : six feet two and distinguished-looking . He has an aquiline nose , fierce white eyebrows that seem to have lives of their own , gray-white hair that , depending on how it is brushed , makes him look either like an elderly Lord Byron seated at a formal dinner or like a homeless man having an alarming vision , and smiling hazel-brown eyes . He is a teacher , and has taught in every kind of setting , for almost sixty years . He changes people 's lives because he believes that everyone is here on earth as an artist ; to tell his particular story or sing her irreplaceable song ; to leave behind a unique creative signature . He believes that your passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over every other reasoned demand : status , benefits , sensible practices . This book is about why he believes this , and what this belief does to the people around him . Most of all , it is about the power of the imagination . Leonard feels that your medium may be words or music or paint ; it could also be the guiding of an organization , the baking of a certain kind of cake , the edging of a garden , the envisioning of a new kind of computer network , or the gesture that brushes the hair away from the forehead of a hurt child . What matters to my father is not whether the creative work is valued in the marketplace ; what matters to him is whether or not it is yours . He wants to know you have put your emotion into it , driven your artist 's discipline into it , seen it through to completion and signed your name to it , if only in your own mind . If you do , he believes , your work comes alive and gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is sure , to you . My dad makes Xerox copies at Kinko 's of the phrase Verba volant / Scripta manent  --  " Spoken words fly away , but writing remains "  --  meaning , get it down , do your creative work , whatever it is . He passes out the Xeroxes to everyone he thinks needs reminding : his grandchildren , his acquaintances , the guy at the cleaners . He believes that each of us arrived here with this unique creative DNA inside us . If we are not doing that thing which is our innate mission , then , he feels , no matter how much money or status we might have , our lives will feel drained of their true color . He believes that no amount of money or recognition can compensate you if you are not doing your life 's passionate creative work ; and if you are not doing it , you had better draw everything to a complete stop until you can listen deeply to your soul , identify your true heart 's desire , and change direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of yours is not told  --  if storytelling is your medium  --  or if that certain song is not sung  --  if you are meant to sing  --  and even if there is almost no one to hear it at the end , then it is not just the artist who has sustained a quiet tragedy ; the world has , too . Leonard believes that you can learn how to live from literature , from art , and that the key to leading a happy , meaningful life is to be found not primarily from the self-help section of a bookstore or from a therapist 's couch , but from paying careful attention to poetry , to whatever constitutes poetry for you . All my life , I have seen how his faith in this possibility  --  that an artist inheres in everyone  --  actually does change people 's lives : the students he has taught over the course of four decades are changed , but so are the lives of people who are simply passing through . His faith in ordinary people 's innate artistry gives him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief has led people with whom he has come into casual contact  --  friends of mine , friends of his , strangers he meets on trains , the staff in his building  --  to suddenly drop whatever is holding them back from their real creative destiny and shift course ; to become happier . When people spend time around my dad , they are always quitting their sensible jobs with good benefits to become schoolteachers , or agitators , or lutenists . I have seen students of his leave high-paying jobs that were making them miserable , or high-status social positions that had been scripted by their families , and follow their hearts in the face of every kind of opposition to become , say , dirt-poor teachers of children in the mountain villages of the Andes . I 've seen the snapshots they send back to him , of themselves with their tattered , clowning kids , their faces suffused with joy . They have found their poetry . My father believes in passionate love , in placing passionate love at the very top of your list of priorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your romantic life , no matter how domestic it is . He believes no one should settle for less . His students are always leaving safe but not essential relationships and finding something truer  --  whether it is a fierce attachment to someone they would have overlooked before as being " unsuitable , " or whether it is taking the risk of solitude in a renewed search for their soul 's real mate . My dad routinely addresses the artist in them , and his students respond accordingly : as artists . This is not calculated on his part ; it is truly what he sees . Other teachers have used similar unself-conscious tricks ; I think often of Martin Luther King Jr. , who always addressed the innate peacemaker in everyone to whom he spoke  --  even those people who were trying to wipe him from the face of the earth . I think the great teachers always speak to the potential they see in their students as if through an X ray , and not to the actual student as he or she appears at that moment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasures that come back his way . The superintendent of my father 's building , John Maudsley  --  a man who is very good at his job  --  talked to my father one day and disclosed his secret passion : in his off hours , he painted : he was " a sign painter and frustrated artist , " as he put it . Leonard did whatever magical thing he does  --  which is as simple as saying a matter-of-fact " Yes , of course , this is your calling "  --  that ignites the power of imagination in otherwise " ordinary " people . Now , in buildings throughout the neighborhood , you can see the masterpieces that emerged from Mr. Maudsley 's basement : a rocking horse painted a gleaming sky blue , with velvet-black reins festooned with crimson roses , as if it has escaped from a merry-go-round ; a persimmon desk-and-bench set scaled to the size of a toddler , with gold and violet edging  --  all are influenced by the brilliant palette of his mind 's eye . He is still a super , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super 's office seems to me to have changed , showing the artist , too : there is a mock-Tiffany lamp illuminating the steel-gray file cabinets with particolored light , and a line of toy antique trucks , orange , black , and yellow , is parked across from the Formica desk and the standard-issue office chair . The sensibility changes the room , the job , the life , though it is the same room and job and life . In addition , something unique to him that derives from his upbringing , as well as from his own individual eye , is blooming in the living rooms of Manhattan . Mr. Maudsley seems to me a happy man . This outcome does n't surprise Leonard . He believes that the creative act is the secret of joy , and in spite of his occasional fits of pro forma testiness , Leonard is the happiest man I have ever known . My father 's sense of optimism  --  that the world would always be full of surprises  --  was helped by the fact that he thought of his own persona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonard owns some unusual clothing . He has a cowboy 's jacket , cut long to protect the rider 's legs when rounding up cattle on the range ; a Stetson  --  original , now a bit battered ; a Basque shepherd 's shirt with ruffles down the chest , made of red flannel for those cold nights in the hills of northern Spain ; a white linen sharpshooter 's shirt complete with epaulets for extra cartridges , if you happen to find yourself in a duel ; a Persian goatskin coat ( " made by the Kashgai tribes that wander across the Iranian desert , " said Leonard ) , with tribal embroidery and primitive bone buttons , that was heavily worn in the winter after the Summer of Love : it still smells of tanning pits . He has a professional bush photographer 's vest , with netting over the pockets so the veld flies do n't get tangled in one 's equipment . Its many small compartments for film and cameras flap when he walks down city streets in the insectless breeze . Leonard has some unusual possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made of fine old leather  --  perched on his computer , though it has been years since the horse passed away . He likes having the saddle handy . You never know . His belief goes something like this : Why stick to one identity ? Why limit your limitless self every day to the costume of a suburban housewife , if once in a while you can be Salome ? Why dress in the costume of a stockbroker  --  or a retired college teacher  --  all the time if you can sometimes be a Zouave horseman ? I believe my father 's insistence on creative freedom may be the secret to happiness . I wanted to gather his central ideas about writing and about life , which to him are the same , to frame a portrait of a moment and a man . And I wanted to trace the little worlds , off the mainstream of midcentury America , that formed my father . This book will tell how Leonard came to believe the things he does , about how your heart 's creative desire  --  in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , in certain ways , set you free . My father came often , over the course of six months , to a house my husband and I own in the woods in upstate New York , to help us build a treehouse for his granddaughter , our daughter , Rosa . During the time Leonard and I worked , we talked in a way that I had been too busy  --  or rather , resistant  --  to do since I was a girl . As we hammered and sanded , Leonard talked about his favorite poems , what they meant to him , the lessons they held . After each conversation , I found that I wanted to share the insights with close friends or students whose problems were pressing on me  --  and his insights also called me , uncomfortably but unmistakably , to reevaluate my own life . Finally , I decided I did not want to get just the glimmers of insight scattered here and there ; I wanted him to teach me , too , formally , what he had taught his students for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creative writing  --  and , many of his students felt , in how to live a life  --  at the school he eventually settled into , San Francisco State University . He obliged me by finding his yellowed lecture notes . The notes came down to twelve basic lessons . I learned their titles with a tremendous sense of recognition , though I had never heard them before ; they were the background music of my childhood . " Be still and listen " ; " Use your imagination " ; " Destroy the box " ; " Speak in your own voice " ; " Identify your heart 's desire " ; " Do nothing without passion " ; " Be disciplined with your gift " ; " Pay attention to the details " ; " Your only wage will be joy " ; " Mistakes are part of the draft " ; " Frame your work " ; " Sign it and let it go " ... these themes struck me again like a bell I carried within that had stopped resonating so long ago I had forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I did not want to at first  --  that everything sensible that had ever guided me rightly was there in them , not just about writing but about life ; and that when I had gone astray , it was because I had deliberately ignored , or insisted on forgetting , as daughters do who are trying to forge their own identity in the world , one of those twelve lessons about literature  --  lessons that are really , or equally , about life . While he was there , teaching me , a multitude of friends and family came to stay , or passed through . Some friends of mine , whom I will call Sophia , Teresa , and Clara ; Leonard 's son , my half brother , Julius ; David Christian , a landscape worker ; a then-three-year-old grandson , Joey ; a then-seven-year-old granddaughter , Rosa ; and several young women from the Woodhull Institute , a leadership organization with which I am involved : I will call them Madeleine and Eva and Alison . I saw him teach them , too , directly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he does naturally . He ca n't help it . I watched yet again , as I have all my life , how people  --  turned in an instant into students , artist-apprentices  --  would talk to him , or hear his suggestions , and think about what he had said , and slowly or abruptly shift direction . I too let myself be a student to him , letting go of the daughter 's resistance , and I shifted direction a bit , too . I let his lifelong advice and example sink in , and started to give the heart , including my own , the respect I had for many years reserved only for the head . Leonard has taught poetry all his life , in a thousand contexts . " Gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche , " he chortles about his adventures , quoting from Chaucer 's description of the Clerke in The Canterbury Tales ( the man will quote Chaucer at the drop of a hat ) . He taught at twelve universities ; he taught orthodox Jewish Yemenite immigrants at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college in a tiny California town , and Muslim students at the Shiraz University in Iran . Leonard says , " Teachers are the people who are the living signposts of your life . They see you coming , and , prescient , they know in which direction you ought to go , and they point to it . They see into the heart of your matter . " He is a teacher who is a humanist , because he has found that great poetry crosses all boundaries ; that all human imaginations tune to love , music , death , and loss in similar ways . In the shah 's Iran , he taught Matthew Arnold 's " Dover Beach " to students who had never seen an ocean . ( " I said , ' Go out and find a pond . Make it bigger , and make it bigger . And make it bigger . Just keep making it bigger , and add salt and waves , and you 've got the sea . ' " ) Just keep making it bigger , and add salt and waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down , I will forget how to do that in my life when I can not see the ocean , and my father is no longer here to remind me that I can always see the ocean . I wanted to tell the story of what I discovered from my eight-decades-old father for myself , and for others who will never get a chance to know him . I have met so many people who are artists in some way but do not realize it ; or who , even if they are struggling to do creative work , feel erased as artists by a culture that picks losers and winners on a commercial basis and gives the rest the message that their creative vision does not count . All these people  --  who may not be professional painters or writers or musicians but whose heart 's desire is to live a creative life  --  deserve to know why at least one man believes they are the real world-changers . I wanted , too , to write about his kind of teaching , because in the course of that summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I came to notice that whenever I said something that changed a young person 's outlook , it had come straight from my years of having been around my father . Finally , I wanted to capture some of what he taught me about love , happiness , loss , and , above all , about the power of the imagination , as I learned from him how to build a treehouse in the woods .
