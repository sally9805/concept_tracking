Most people who come to Allison DuBois are trying to reach the souls of the dead . Paramount Television came to her to find living viewers . DuBois , a Phoenix , Ariz. , psychic who lends her services to crime investigations , had earlier worked with Paramount on an unsuccessful reality pilot , Oracles , in which a panel of five seers gave readings to a studio audience . In 2003 , the company asked if it could base a drama series on her , to be overseen by Glenn Gordon Caron of Moonlighting fame . The creator of a romantic private-eye series may not have seemed the natural choice to produce a creepy show about death and afterlife , but , DuBois says , " he really got the spirit  --  excuse the pun  --  of my work . " <P> Medium ( NBC , Mondays , 10 p.m . E.T. ) , starring Patricia Arquette as the fictionalized DuBois , debuted last month with more than 16 million viewers . Given her vocation , DuBois might have seen the show 's success coming , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a chance . ( Hey , she started it ! ) Since the launches of Twin Peaks and The X-Files , the network schedules have been littered with failed attempts at spooky , paranormal series : Millennium , The Others , Miracles , Wolf Lake and more . ( The exceptions , like Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Joan of Arcadia and HBO 's Carnivale , have been cult hits or cable shows . ) Viewers , meanwhile , gravitated to reality shows and firmly realistic cop procedurals . <P> But this season , with the Top 10 debut of ABC 's eerie Lost , there are signs that viewers are ready for less naturalism and more supernaturalism . Fox recently debuted Point Pleasant ( Thursdays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) , a self-serious horror soap in which a young woman in a New Jersey resort town turns out to be the daughter of Satan . Says Pleasant executive producer and Buffy alumna Marti Noxon : The networks are discovering that " there are certain things that you ca n't do in reality shows . " <P> Noxon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a female Antichrist is Paris Hilton . But a supernatural angle can also offer new twists on played-out drama formats . For Caron , an admitted skeptic about psychics , the attraction of Medium was writing about a woman whose gift separates her from other people  --  as opposed to producing TV 's umpteenth cop series . " There are more than enough crime shows , and I had no interest in being the next one , " says Caron . <P> That 's just as well , because Medium is not a very good crime show . Its grisly murder tales out of the CSI playbook are average at best . Medium distinguishes itself as a character study : Allison is still learning to trust her own abilities and handle the responsibility they impose , and Arquette portrays her with a refreshing mundanity . " Allison 's not a cop , " Arquette says . " She 's a housewife . It 's that conflict that interests me : trying to be a good mother while at the same time dealing with the dead guy sitting at the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently sparring relationship with her husband Joe ( Jake Weber ) , an engineer . As a scientist , he offers a skeptical counterpoint to her intuitions ; as a husband , he deals with such problems as how to throw a surprise party for a wife who can read minds . Their marriage is intellectual , head butting and loving  --  part Mulder and Scully , part David and Maddie , part Darren and Samantha .
