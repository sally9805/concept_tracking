FOR MORE INSTRUCTION THAT FITS YOUR GAME , GO TO GOLFONLINE.COM LOW HANDICAPPER You play well , but want to shave those last few strokes from your handicap . You know the feeling . You 're having one of those rounds where everything is going right , and then a great drive ends up in a fairway divot . This is not the time to get frustrated . You have the talent to pull off a shot from this tricky lie ; you just have to know what to expect . Where the ball sits in the divot will tell you how to play the shot . Here are a few tips to help you out . If your ball is against the rear part of the divot ... Chop down on the ball as if you were hitting from heavy rough . Take one more club than normal and expect a low trajectory . If your ball sits against the inside of the divot ... The grass will grab the heel of your club and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of your target and grip the club a little tighter to compensate . If your ball is against the front part of the divot ... It 's a good lie in disguise . You have enough room to make clean contact , and you often can put extra height and spin on the shot . If your ball sits against the outside of the divot ... The toe of the club will tend to open during impact . Aim 10 yards left and try to release your wrists through the shot . STRAIGHT HITTER You keep the ball in play , but a lack of distance puts pressure on your game . Two ways to add pop Just because you are n't King Kong off the tee , it does n't mean you ca n't groove a swing that adds some yards to your drives . Just focus on two key areas : your angle of attack and your clubhead speed . Here are two drills that will help you put the power you do have to better use . Angle of attack : Left heel up Longer drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle of attack , sweeping it off the tee with power . You might be inadvertently hitting down on the ball and losing distance by having too much of your weight toward your left side at address . The next time you set up to a ball , correct this by lifting your left heel up off the ground , which will tilt your upper body behind the ball . Keep that left heel up and make some easy swings with your driver . Having your body behind the ball will make you feel like you 're hitting up on it at first , but stick with your new setup and gradually lower your heel once it becomes comfortable . With more of your weight on your right side , you 'll be able to sweep the clubhead through for a more powerful hit . Speed : Walk and whack " em Clubhead speed is a terrific thing , but only if it 's effectively transferred to the ball at impact . The best way to do this is by keeping your arms and hands loose , which will help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient motion  --  one that will create clubhead speed at the proper place . Try the walk-through drill : Tee up a ball and address it with a mid-iron , then set up four more balls in a line extending straight out from the first ball . Then hit each ball in succession while staying in constant motion . Hit the first ball , and then step toward the second ball as you swing back again . Then come down , hit that ball and step toward the third ball . Your goal is to make solid contact from the first ball to the last , feeling how the rhythm in your swing creates clubhead speed . When you switch to your driver , you will see a difference in the amount of speed you generate at impact . HIGH HANDICAPPER You have potential , but must solve some fundamental problems . Use your time wisely Do you have a few hours each week to devote to practice ? That would be the ideal to help get your handicap down where you want it . But even if you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend your practice time will help you achieve better results the next time you play . Isolate three critical areas  --  the takeaway , the short game and putting  --  to make your practice time work for you . Takeaway : Use a forward press A smooth takeaway is essential for everyone , but it is especially important for you because your mechanics are not yet sound enough to overcome a quick start away from the ball . Practice a forward press to help you kick the habit of jerking the club away from the ball . Take your address position , then nudge your hands toward the target a couple of inches and rotate your hip just a touch , so your right knee kicks in a little . In essence , this forward press mimics the impact position , which is another reason it is valuable . Move from your normal address to here , and then immediately into your backswing for better tempo to the top . Short Game : Vary your distances Any time you can spend hitting chips and pitches has an immediate impact on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drop 15 balls and hit them all from the same spot . Your path to improvement lies in varying the distance you hit these short shots so you become comfortable with altering your swing and club selection to fit the shot at hand . Start off with some short pitches of about 15-to-20 yards , then move up to 60-yard half-wedge shots , followed by bump-and-run chips of 30 yards or so . Hit some from good lies and others from bare or deep lies . You 'll find it easier to handle these situations when you 're on the course . DRILL : STOP-AND-GO PUTTING You can cut down on your three-putts by practicing long lags of 30 to 50 feet , but do n't hit them all at the same time . Use 10-minute practice sessions for each distance , with 10-minute breaks in between . The breaks force you to adjust your feel for each practice session , which will improve your speed control . Start out with 40-footers , hitting 20 balls to different holes ( so you experience all sorts of breaks on the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break , and finally the 30-footers to finish . POWER HITTER You hit the ball a long way , but your game needs control and consistency . Tighten up your swing Harnessing your natural power is the key to hitting more fairways . Most likely , you hit your drives offline because of a " loose " swing . This term suggests there is a mechanical breakdown somewhere in your motion that is keeping you from returning the club to the ball in the best position . Where is your leak and how do you plug it ? Try one of these cures to see if it solves your problem . Reduce wrist cock If you have floppy wrists during your backswing , chances are you hit the ball " long and wrong . " Excessive wrist action does create leverage , and therefore power , but it also makes control difficult . It 's time to make your swing a little more compact , so that instead of searching for your ball in the trees you 'll be striding confidently down  --  way down  --  the fairway . Grip down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your right hand only . ( Put your left hand behind your back . ) Then make one-armed practice swings , and notice how this forces you to rotate your body to the top and cuts down on your wrist hinge . Let your right arm fall to start the downswing , and feel how it pulls your body through . Make several practice swings like this , then return to a two-handed swing and hit some balls . You should feel that your arms , rather than your wrists , control the motion and naturally square the clubface at impact . Get hippy to lose your slice Wild drives can easily result when you get lazy with your lower body . Usually , you swing the club down over the top because the hands cast out in an effort to make up for the power that the hips are n't providing . This leads to wild slices , and , to straighten them out , you need to even up the workload by activating your hips . From your normal address position , hold a 5-iron behind your hips with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as far as you can go , trying to turn the end of the club past your left foot . If you have to lift your left heel off the ground a bit to do this , go ahead . Finally , turn your hips through until your belt buckle faces the target . The opposite end of the club should now have moved almost to the center of your stance . Mimic this motion in the swing to cut out your slice . SENIOR PLAYER You have lost some flexibility and power , but you can still play well . Maintain the triangle You 've been playing the game for ages , so the last thing you need is to clutter your mind with a lot of swing thoughts . That is n't going to get you out of a rut . So keep things simple with one good thought to help you make solid contact : Maintain the triangle formed by your shoulders and arms for as long as possible . This triangle keeps the club moving on a proper path so that it rotates back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the triangle breaks down , contact is made near the toe or the heel of the club . To keep it intact , think about throwing a ball from home plate to right field This image will help you to swing out , extending your arms rather than folding them too soon .
