Seasoned U.N . diplomats had expected something out of the ordinary when Richard Holbrooke , Washington 's media-savvy U.N . ambassador , took over the presidency of the Security Council this month . They were not disappointed . Last week he devoted the council 's first session in the new century to an unprecedented discussion of AIDS , normally the domain of lesser U.N . branches . And in a move guaranteed to draw maximum attention , he turned the presidency of the session over to Al Gore , an unusual platform for a U.S. Vice President . It was the first time the Security Council has discussed a health issue , and China and Russia pointedly refused to join in , insisting the council was not the proper forum . <P> But the grandstanding was intended to make a serious point . Holbrooke argued forcefully that the pandemic , which infects 33.6 million people worldwide , 23.3 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa , constitutes as great a threat to international security as any military conflict . Gore warned that AIDS will probably kill as many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th century combined . The outgoing Clinton Administration , he promised , will ask Congress for an additional $100 million , boosting the total U.S. commitment to fighting AIDS worldwide to $325 million . Equally important , Gore confirmed that Washington is relaxing some of its more draconian trade restrictions on AIDS-ravaged countries . <P> American interest in African AIDS has intensified since a series in the Boston Globe gave the issue new prominence last fall . So Gore 's announcement appealed to domestic voters such as the gay-rights groups that attacked him last summer for allegedly supporting U.S. pharmaceutical companies trying to block the manufacture of generic AIDS drugs in South Africa . " He is showing presidential-quality leadership , " said Eric Sawyer , a founder of ACT UP New York . " Compared to the other candidates , he is doing all the right things . " But some Africans said they were unimpressed by the pledge of only $100 million more to deal with a crisis that experts predict could cost $2.3 billion . <P> The AIDS debate is only the first act in a busy agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post wants to keep the spotlight shining on Africa . He has already held an open discussion on sub-Saharan refugees , has invited Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms to address the council , and is trying to broker a peace in the multicountry Congo war . <P> Holbrooke 's unorthodox approach may have ruffled some feathers , but it also showcased his talent for mixing smart domestic and global politics . Gore scored electoral points as a crusader against AIDS , while Holbrooke strengthened his candidacy to be Secretary of State if Gore is elected President . The high-profile debate also put the U.S. back in the driver 's seat at the U.N. , after a long period of bickering and lackluster performances . By shifting the focus to Africa , Holbrooke is providing a breather from divisive issues such as Kosovo and Iraq and pushing the Security Council to think more creatively about its role . Notes a seasoned U.N . official : " He has simply expanded the definition of what constitutes a security threat . " So far , the strategy seems to be working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
