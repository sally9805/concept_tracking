<p> Early in her flying career , Meryl Getline was ferrying an air taxi back to Anchorage when a door blew open at 10,000 feet over the Gulf of Alaska . <p> Belted in , she remained safely in the pilot 's seat . But everything else in the pressurized cabin was sucked out , including her logbook - the only record of the hundreds of hours she had flown since getting her license at the age of 20 . <p> ' I thought , there goes my career , ' she says , from her current vantage point as a Denver-based senior captain for United Airlines . <p> After looking more closely , the young pilot saw that her briefcase , logbook inside , had somehow caught on a metal strut extending from the wing to the fuselage and was being held in place by the wind , just out of reach . <p> It was a put-up or shut-up moment . <p> ' I trimmed up the controls as best I could , grabbed the strut with both hands and inched myself out , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of maneuvered it toward me . ' <p> After landing safely , the fledgling wing walker saw what might have happened had she failed to retrieve her irreplaceable cargo : the Cessna Skymaster 's flight manual , caught in a similar way , came loose and ' went through the propeller like confetti . ' <p> Getline , now 50 , recounts this and other obstacles she has overcome - including airsickness so severe she passed out on her first flight lesson - in ' The World at My Feet , ' a memoir due out this summer . <p> As a chronicle of adventure and determination , it has won plaudits from none other than Frank Abagnale , the legendary con man portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie ' Catch Me If You Can . ' <p> ' The one thing Meryl and I certainly have in common , ' says Abagnale , who passed as a Pan Am pilot for two years in the 1960s , ' is the belief that nothing is impossible . ' <p> Beyond the book , the <p> flying public also can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up <p> to answer people 's questions about airlines , airports and <p> aviation in general : <p> Wonder which airport is the most technically difficult to fly into ? Mexico City , she says . <p> What plane is the most fun to fly ? ' Whatever airplane I 'm flying . ' <p> How do men feel about women in the cockpit ? ' These days it is thankfully pretty much a nonissue . ' <p> Visit www.fromthecockpit.com , in short , and feel the skies get a little friendlier . <p> ' I do n't consider my job just getting people from Point A to Point B. That 's primary , but I also want our passengers to have a good experience , and communicating with them is part of that , ' Getline says . <p> ' I wo n't answer any questions about security , but I can answer questions about how planes fly and what terms mean , or why runways are designated the way they are and how we know what route to follow on the ground . ' <p> She says her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially , the Chicago-based airline neither supports nor opposes it . As spokesman Jeff Green explains , ' It 's kind of her own private project . ' <p> The unpretentious website , which has gotten off the ground only recently , may not warrant the kind of acclaim accorded to winners of the Super Bowl - whom Getline once carried , in fact , as a charter pilot for the San Francisco 49ers . <p> But for folks who would n't know an aileron from an altimeter , it offers both revelations and reassurance . <p> Karen Wira of Louisville , Ky. , a travel consultant who has known Getline for several years , says the ' Cap'n , ' as Getline jocularly refers to herself , is far more keen on keeping passengers in touch with the flight deck than most pilots . <p> ' I 'm not sure that it 's just that she 's a woman . It 's the person she is , ' Wira says . <p> ' She takes away the discomfort that some people feel about having a woman in the pilot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like with turbulence , she 'll say it 's kind of like going over a rocky road , and you believe her . She 's understated and unassuming and smart , and you can tell she knows what she 's doing . She 's confident , and in a lot of cases , that 's all that fliers want to know . It takes away the unknown . ' <p> Getline also is passionately in love with flying . Her enthusiasm is so infectious that passengers have been known to gather around her at the end of a flight as if they were waiting to meet a celebrity . <p> Says Al Carmickle , a retired United captain she describes as her ' better half ' : ' She gets more compliments on one flight than I got in 36 years . ' <p> Getline , who grew up in San Diego , stepped into a cockpit for the first time on a trip to Europe to study German for high school . But it did n't occur to her to get her wings until she was in her second year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poster advertising an extension course for private pilot ground school . <p> ' That 's the day everything changed , ' she says . ' My interest switched from linguistics to aviation , and then I found out the hard way that I get radically airsick . ' <p> The queasiness was n't as bad at night as in the daytime , however , so she managed to keep her dream aloft by taking flight lessons at 3 a.m . <p> Ironically , even though she no longer gets ill , she still prefers flying at night . And because most pilots would rather work days , this means she usually receives the shifts she wants . <p> Once she obtained her private pilot 's license - paying for the instruction with money she made in real estate , a sideline she pursues when her schedule permits - Getline decided to join the military in hopes of logging lots of hours in the cockpit . But she was told the Air Force would n't admit a woman into flight school , so she enlisted in the Army instead , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an air traffic controller . <p> ' I was a horrible soldier , ' she confesses . ' The first thing I did was rent a plane and fly five of my buddies out to the West Coast from boot camp in Alabama for Christmas leave . On the way back , the airplane broke down in Dallas , and we all had to hitchhike back to the base - by air . ' <p> Getline was 21 at the time . As she tells it , she got out of the Army after several similarly audacious adventures , then went to work as a pilot for a commuter airline in Southern California . <p> She obtained a DC-10 jumbo-jet rating by the time she was 27 , then flew for the now-defunct Wien Air Alaska before signing on with United in 1985 . <p> ' I had always wanted to go with United , because I 'd flown it as a kid and they treated me well . I also liked their routes , I liked their airplanes and I liked their paint job , ' she says with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . ' <p> She first sought a position with United in 1977 , but at the time , the company only hired male pilots , and her application was rejected . Only a few months later , United hired its first woman pilot . <p> The second time she applied , in 1985 , she got an interview . But it was only a few months before the Air Line Pilots Association went out on a contentious 30-day strike , and her decision to accept an offer and start training on United planes later got her blacklisted . <p> ' To this day , there are people who consider me a scab , even though I never flew a revenue-producing flight during the strike , ' she says . <p> Getline and eight other pilots filed suit against the union in 1992 , complaining they had been ostracized and subjected to various forms of post-strike harassment . But the claims were never resolved because the case was dismissed on technical grounds . <p> More recently , she says , she has received obscene hate mail from website visitors she assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman John Mazor says the union does n't encourage or condone such behavior . <p> ' If there was anything going on , it would have been the actions of individual pilots , ' he says . <p> As a member of the first generation of female airline pilots , Getline also has faced sexual harassment . One pilot in Alaska told her , ' Why do n't you go home and have babies ? ' Her response : ' Lovely . ' <p> In general , she says , ' I feel like my co-pilots today are quite friendly . If there is any hostility , I have n't seen it for years and years . They 're either more OK with it or they 're hiding it pretty well . ' <p> Pioneering pilot Bonnie Tiburzi , the first woman captain for a major airline , says it took ' true passion and endless determination ' for Getline to triumph over the sexism she faced early on . <p> ' What keeps surprising me is that every new generation seems to have skepticism about female pilots , ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Takeoff . ' ' Meryl came along some 12 years after I was hired , and at least a hundred or so other women ( were also ) airline pilots , yet she still ran into opposition . She was still told women ' do n't ' and women ' should n't . ' To her credit , she stuck to it and persevered . ' <p> As one of about 7,500 active United pilots , Getline flies 75 to 90 hours per month , not counting preparation time , layover time or the hour it takes to drive each way between Denver International Airport and her home in rural Elbert County - a 9,600- <p> square-foot abode she shares with Carmickle , two ferrets and an exotic tropical bird named Houdini , ' because he can get out of anything . ' <p> Mostly , she pilots Airbus 319 or 320 jetliners on domestic routes and flights to and from Mexico , Canada and Puerto Rico . She also has been a co-pilot on lengthy flights to and from Asia , and before she faces mandatory retirement at 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controls of a Boeing 747 . <p> In her years with United , Getline says , she has never been involved in a crash or serious incident . But as a pilot for a small commuter line in California , she once survived a bird strike that barely missed killing a passenger . <p> It happened over a fishing village on the Baja peninsula in the late 1970s , when a turkey buzzard came through the windshield of her small twin-engine craft , sending shards of glass into the face of a man sitting in the co-pilot 's seat . <p> ' We were on final approach , the windshield was covered with blood and guts , and I could n't see to land , ' she says . ' So I turned the plane sideways , took a peek and came in . ' <p> The passenger , whose injuries did n't turn out to be life-threatening , was quickly washed off with a bottle of water and sent back to Los Angeles on another plane to get stitched up . <p> But because the phone at the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order a replacement windshield - aboard the only transportation available at the time , the four-legged kind . <p> ' On the way back , it 's raining and I 'm on a burro named Pepe , ' she says .
