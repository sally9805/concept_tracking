HER BOLD EXPERIMENT TO TEACH IOWA THIRD GRADERS ABOUT RACIAL PREJUDICE DIVIDED TOWNSPEOPLE AND THRUST HER ONTO THE NATIONAL STAGE . DECADES LATER , JANE ELLIOTT 'S STUDENTS SAY THE ORDEAL CHANGED THEM FOR GOOD <p> ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 5 , 1968 , a Friday , Steven Armstrong stepped into Jane Elliott 's third-grade classroom in Riceville , Iowa . " Hey , Mrs. Elliott , " Steven yelled as he slung his books on his desk . " They shot that King yesterday . Why 'd they shoot that King ? " <p> All 28 children found their desks , and Elliott said she had something special for them to do , to begin to understand the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr . the day before . <p> " How do you think it would feel to be a Negro boy or girl ? " she asked the children , who were white . " It would be hard to know , would n't it , unless we actually experienced discrimination ourselves . Would you like to find out ? " <p> A chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most astonishing exercises ever conducted in an American classroom . Now , almost four decades later , Elliott 's experiment still matters  --  to the grown children with whom she experimented , to the people of Riceville , population 840 , who all but ran her out of town , and to thousands of people around the world who have also participated in an exercise based on the experiment . ( She prefers the term " exercise . " ) It is sometimes cited as a landmark of social science . The textbook publisher McGraw-Hill has listed her on a timeline of key educators , along with Confucius , Plato , Aristotle , Horace Mann , Booker T. Washington , Maria Montessori and 23 others . Yet what Elliott did continues to stir controversy One scholar asserts that it is " Orwellian " and teaches whites " self-contempt . " A columnist at a Denver newspaper called it " evil . " <p> That spring morning 37 years ago , the blue-eyed children were set apart from the children with brown or green eyes . Elliott pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to wear one . " The brown-eyed people are the better people in this room , " Elliott began . " They are cleaner and they are smarter . " <p> She knew that the children were n't going to buy her pitch unless she came up with a reason , and the more scientific to these Space Age children of the 1960s , the better . " Eye color , hair color and skin color are caused by a chemical , " Elliott went on , writing MELANIN on the blackboard . Melanin , she said , is what causes intelligence . The more melanin , the darker the person 's eyes  --  and the smarter the person . " Brown-eyed people have more of that chemical in their eyes , so brown-eyed people are better than those with blue eyes , " Elliott said . " Blue-eyed people sit around and do nothing . You give them something nice and they just wreck it . " She could feel a chasm forming between the two groups of students . " Do blue-eyed people remember what they 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the brown-eyed kids said . <p> Elliott rattled off the rules for the day , saying blue-eyed kids had to use paper cups if they drank from the water fountain . " Why ? " one girl asked . <p> " Because we might catch something , " a brown-eyed boy said . Everyone looked at Mrs. Elliott . She nodded . <p> As the morning wore on , brown-eyed kids berated their blue-eyed classmates . " Well , what do you expect from him , Mrs. Elliott , " a brown-eyed student said as a blue-eyed student got an arithmetic problem wrong . " He 's a bluey ! " <p> Then , the inevitable : " Hey , Mrs. Elliott , how come you 're the teacher if you 've got blue eyes ? " a brown-eyed boy asked . Before she could answer , another boy piped up : " If she did n't have blue eyes , she 'd be the principal or the superintendent . " <p> At lunchtime , Elliott hurried to the teachers ' lounge . She described to her colleagues what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with brown eyes had transformed themselves into confident leaders of the class . Withdrawn brown-eyed kids were suddenly outgoing , some beaming with the widest smiles she had ever seen on them . She asked the other teachers what they were doing to bring news of the King assassination into their classrooms . The answer , in a word , was nothing . <p> Back in the classroom , Elliott 's experiment had taken on a life of its own . A smart blue-eyed girl who had never had problems with multiplication tables started making mistakes . She slumped . At recess , three brown-eyed girls ganged up on her . " You better apologize to us for getting in our way because we 're better than you are , " one of the brownies said . The blue-eyed girl apologized . <p> On Monday , Elliott reversed the exercise , and the brown-eyed kids were told how shifty , dumb and lazy they were . Later , it would occur to Elliott that the blueys were much less nasty than the brown-eyed kids had been , perhaps because the blue-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to inflict it on their former tormentors . <p> When the exercise ended , some of the kids hugged , some cried . Elliott reminded them that the reason for the lesson was the King assassination , and she asked them to write down what they had learned . Typical of their responses was that of Debbie Hughes , who reported that " the people in Mrs. Elliott 's room who had brown eyes got to discriminate against the people who had blue eyes . I have brown eyes . I felt like hitting them if I wanted to . I got to have five minutes extra of recess . " The next day when the tables were turned , " I felt like quitting school .... I felt mad . That 's what it feels like when you 're discriminated against . " <p> Elliott shared the essays with her mother , who showed them to the editor of the weekly Riceville Recorder . He printed them under the headline " How Discrimination Feels . " The Associated Press followed up , quoting Elliott as saying she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think these children walked in a colored child 's moccasins for a day , " she was quoted as saying . <p> That might have been the end of it , but a month later , Elliott says , Johnny Carson called her . " Would you like to come on the show ? " he asked . <p> Elliott flew to the NBC studio in New York City On the " Tonight Show " Carson broke the ice by spoofing Elliott 's rural roots . " I understand this is the first time you 've flown ? " Carson asked , grinning . <p> " On an airplane , it is , " Elliott said to appreciative laughter from the studio audience . She chatted about the experiment , and before she knew it was whisked off the stage . <p> Hundreds of viewers wrote letters saying Elliott 's work appalled them . " How dare you try this cruel experiment out on white children , " one said . " Black children grow up accustomed to such behavior , but white children , there 's no way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and will cause them great psychological damage . " <p> Elliott replied , " Why are we so worried about the fragile egos of white children who experience a couple of hours of made-up racism one day when blacks experience real racism every day of their lives ? " <p> THE PEOPLE OF RICEVILLE did not exactly welcome Elliott home from New York with a hayride . Looking back , I think part of the problem was that , like the residents of other small midwestern towns I 've covered , many in Riceville felt that calling attention to oneself was poor manners , and that Elliott had shone a bright light not just on herself but on Riceville ; people all over the United States would think Riceville was full of bigots . Some residents were furious . <p> When Elliott walked into the teachers ' lounge the next Monday , several teachers got up and walked out . When she went downtown to do errands , she heard whispers . She and her husband , Darald Elliott , then a grocer , have four children , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary , came home from school one day in tears , sobbing that her sixth grade classmates had surrounded her in the school hallway and taunted her by saying her mother would soon be sleeping with black men . Brian , the Elliotts ' oldest son , got beaten up at school , and Jane called the ringleader 's mother . " Your son got what he deserved , " the woman said . When Sarah , the Elliotts ' oldest daughter , went to the girls ' bathroom in junior high , she came out of a stall to see a message scrawled in red lipstick on the mirror : " Nigger lover . " <p> Elliott is nothing if not stubborn . She would conduct the exercise for the nine more years she taught the third grade , and the next eight years she taught seventh and eighth graders before giving up teaching in Riceville , in 1985 , largely to conduct the eye-color exercise for groups outside the school . In 1970 , she demonstrated it for educators at a White House Conference on Children and Youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led training sessions at General Electric , Exxon , AT &T,; IBM and other corporations , and has lectured to the IRS , the U.S. Navy , the U.S. Department of Education and the Postal Service . She has spoken at more than 350 colleges and universities . She has appeared on the " Oprah Winfrey Show " five times . <p> THE FOURTH OF FIVE CHILDREN , Elliott was born on her family 's farm in Riceville in 1933 , and was delivered by her Irish-American father himself . She was 10 before the farmhouse had running water and electricity She attended a one-room rural schoolhouse . Today , at 72 , Elliott , who has short white hair , a penetrating gaze and no-nonsense demeanor , shows no signs of slowing . She and Darald split their time between a converted schoolhouse in Osage , Iowa , a town 18 miles from Riceville , and a home near Riverside , California . <p> Elliott 's friends and family say she 's tenacious , and has always had a reformer 's zeal . " She was an excellent school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says 90-year-old Riceville native Patricia Bodenham , who has known Elliott since Jane was a baby . " She stirs people up . " <p> Vision and tenacity may get results , but they do n't always endear a person to her neighbors . " Mention two words-Jane Elliott  --  and you get a flood of emotions from people , " says Jim Cross , the Riceville Recorder 's editor these days . " You can see the look on their faces . It brings up immediate anger and hatred . " <p> When I met Elliott in 2003 , she had n't been back to Riceville in 12 years . We walked into the principal 's office at Riceville Elementary School , Elliott 's old haunt . The secretary on duty looked up , startled , as if she had just seen a ghost . " We want to see Room No , 10 , " Elliott said . It was typical of Elliott 's blunt style-no " Good morning , " no small talk . <p> The secretary said the south side of the building was closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to peek in , " I volunteered . " We 'll just be a couple of minutes . " <p> Absolutely not . <p> " This here is Jane Elliott , " I said . " She taught in this school for 18 years . " <p> " I know who she is . " <p> We backed out . I was stunned . Elliott was not . " They ca n't forget me , " she said , " and because of who they are , they ca n't forgive me . " <p> We stopped on Woodlawn Avenue , and a woman in her mid-40s approached us on the sidewalk . " That you , Ms. Elliott ? " <p> Jane shielded her eyes from the morning sun . " Malinda ? Malinda Whisenhunt ? " <p> " Ms. Elliott , how are you ? " <p> The two hugged , and Whisenhunt had tears streaming down her cheeks . Now 45 , she had been in Elliott 's third-grade class in 1969 . " Let me look at you , " Elliott said . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've still got that same sweet smile . And you 'll always have it . " <p> " I 've never forgotten the exercise , " Whisenhunt volunteered . " It changed my life . Not a day goes by without me thinking about it , Ms. Elliott . When my grandchildren are old enough , I 'd give anything if you 'd try the exercise out on them . Would you ? Could you ? " <p> Tears formed in the corners of Elliott 's eyes . <p> THE CORN GROWS SO FAST in northern Iowa  --  from seedling to seven-foot-high stalk in 12 weeks  --  that it crackles . In the early morning , dew and fog cover the acres of gently swaying stalks that surround Riceville the way water surrounds an island . The tallest structure in Riceville is the water tower . The nearest traffic light is 20 miles away : The Hangout Bar &; Grill , the Riceville Pharmacy and A Touch of Dutch , a restaurant owned by Mennonites , Line Main Street . In a grassy front yard down the block is a hand-lettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Folks leave their cars unlocked , keys in the ignition . Locals say that drivers do n't signal when they turn because everyone knows where everyone else is going . <p> Most Riceville residents seem to have an opinion of Elliott , whether or not they 've met her . " It 's the same thing over and over again , " Cross says . " It 's Riceville 30 years ago . Some people feel we ca n't move on when you have her out there hawking her 30-year-old experiment . It 's the Jane Elliott machine . " <p> Walt Gabelmann , 83 , was Riceville 's mayor for 18 years beginning in 1966 . " She could get kids to do anything she wanted them to , " he says of Elliott . " She got carried away by this possession she developed over human beings . " <p> A former teacher , Ruth Setka , 79 , said she was perhaps the only teacher who would still talk to Elliott . " I think third grade was too young for what she did . Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the classroom . And what she did caused an uproar . Everyone 's tired of her . I 'm tired of hearing about her and her experiment and how everyone here is a racist . That 's not true . Let 's just move on . " <p> Steve Harnack , 62 , served as the elementary school principal beginning in 1977 . " I do n't think this community was ready for what she did , " he said . " Maybe the way to sell the exercise would have been to invite the parents in , to talk about what she 'd be doing . You must get the parents first . " <p> Dean Weaver , 70 , superintendent of Riceville schools from 1972 to 1979 , said , " She 'd just go ahead and do things . She was a local girl and the other teachers were intimidated by her success . Jane would get invited to go to Timbuktu to give a speech . That got the other teachers angry . " <p> FOR YEARS SCHOLARS have evaluated Elliott 's exercise , seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychological risk to them . The results are mixed . Two education professors in England , Ivor F. Goodson and Pat Sikes , suggest that Elliott 's experiment was unethical because the participants were n't informed of its real purpose beforehand . Alan Charles Kors , a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania , says Elliott 's diversity training is " Orwellian " and singled her out as " the Torquemada of thought reform . " Kors writes that Elliott 's exercise taught " blood-guilt and self-contempt to whites , " adding that " in her view , nothing has changed in America since the collapse of Reconstruction . " In a similar vein , Linda Seebach , a conservative columnist for the Rocky Mountain News , wrote in 2004 that Elliott was a " disgrace " and described her exercise as " sadistic , " adding , " You would think that any normal person would realize that she had done an evil thing . But not Elliott . She repeated the abuse with subsequent classes , and finally turned it into a fully commercial enterprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building Moral Intelligence : The Seven Essential Virtues That Teach Kids to Do the Right Things , educational psychologist Michele Borda says it " teaches our children to counter stereotypes before they become full-fledged , lasting prejudices and to recognize that every human being has the right to be treated with respect . " Amitai Etzioni , a sociologist at George Washington University , says the exercise helps develop character and empathy . And Stanford University psychologist Philip G. Zimbardo writes in his 1979 textbook , Psychology and Life , that Elliott 's " remarkable " experiment tried to show " how easily prejudiced attitudes may be formed and how arbitrary and illogical they can be . " Zimbardo  --  creator of the also controversial 1971 Stanford Prisoner Experiment , which was stopped after college student volunteers acting as " guards " humiliated students acting as " prisoners "  --  says Elliott 's exercise is " more compelling than many done by professional psychologists . " <p> ELLIOTT DEFENDS HER WORK as a mother defends her child . " You have to put the exercise in the context of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , the children felt angry , hurt , betrayed . But they returned to a better place  --  unlike a child of color , who gets abused every day , and never has the ability to find him or herself in a nurturing classroom environment . " As for the criticism that the exercise encourages children to distrust authority figures-the teacher lies , then recants the lies and maintains they were justified because of a greater good  --  she says she worked hard to rebuild her students ' trust . The exercise is " an inoculation against racism , " she says . " We give our children shots to inoculate them against polio and smallpox , to protect them against the realities in the future . There are risks to those inoculations , too , but we determine that those risks are worth taking . " <p> Elliott says the role of a teacher is to enhance students ' moral development . " That 's what I tried to teach , and that 's what drove the other teachers crazy , School ought to be about developing character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten-foot pole . " <p> Elliott and I were sitting at her dining room table . The smell of the crops and loam and topsoil and manure wafted though the open door . Outside , rows of corn stretched to the horizon . " There 's a sense of renewal here that I 've never seen anywhere else , " Elliott says . <p> It occurs to me that for a teacher , the arrival of new students at the start of each school year has a lot in common with the return of crops each summer . <p> Elliott continues , " Just when you think that the fertile soil can sprout no more , another season comes round , and you see another year of bountiful crops , tall and straight . It makes you proud . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Riceville , Iowa , was the unlikely setting for a controversial classroom exercise created by Jane Elliott ( with third-graders in 1969 ) .
