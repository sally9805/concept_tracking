Chapter One The Gentleman , Barnes It was a lovely night to be indoors , where I sat all warm and lazy by the fire in our lodgings on Marylebone High Street . I had survived the awful tedium of studying my school lessons ( need n't have bothered with those , really ) , the servant had gone off to see her sweetheart , and I was perking up considerable with the help of Tom and Huck , who were hatching wild schemes to help Jim escape from Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally . Tom was an exasperating fellow . He never did anything the easy way . Keen as I was on Mr. Twain 's book , however , I kept an ear open for the sound of footfalls on the stairs . And I kept not hearing any . There was just the sound of rain rapping on the window panes . Mother should 've been back some time ago . She 'd left directly after supper to give her Thursday night violin lesson to Liz McNaughton , who had but one leg due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean-spirited of me , I found myself wishing Liz had kept her leg and lost an arm . Would 've put a damper on her violining . That way , Mother would 've been spared the chore of paying her a visit on such a rough night , and I would 've been spared my worries . But worry I did . I could never rest easy when Mother was away at night . I had no father , nor any but the foggiest memory of him , as he 'd been a soldier attached to the Berkshires , and was fetched up dead by a Jezail bullet at the battle of Maiwand when I was just a sprout . Growing up fatherless , I had a morbid dread of losing Mother as well . So while I wondered what had delayed her return that night , I conjured up a whole passel of dreadful fates queuing up to have a go at her . Even in more normal times , she might have been run down by a hansom or attacked by cutthroats , or met some other terrible end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Whitechapel murderer lurking about with his knife . While most of the folks in London knew only what they read in the newspapers , I was quite well versed on all the grim particulars of the Ripper 's atrocities due to Uncle William , who worked out of the Leman Street police station . He had not only gotten a firsthand look at two of the victims right where they fell , but he took a keen delight in regailing me ( when Mother was n't about ) with gory descriptions of what he 'd seen . Oh , his eyes merrily flashed with mischief and relish ! I 've no doubt he was quite amused at how I must 've blanched . However , I was always eager to hear more . Tonight , awaiting Mother 's return , I wished I knew nothing of the Ripper . I told myself there was no reason to fear that he might strike her down . After all , one-legged Liz 's flat was no closer to the East End than our own . The Ripper would have to roam far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , it was still too early in the night for him to be out stalking . And he only killed whores . Mother certainly ought to be safe from him . But I made my head sore with worrying . By and by , I set the book aside and took to pacing the floor , all in a bother . I 'd been at this a while before a door shut down below . That was followed by heavy , staggering footfalls on the stairway . Mother 's step was usually quick and light . Curious , I hurried out and peered down the stairs . There , struggling beneath the weight of Rolfe Barnes , was Mother . " Mum ! " " Give us a hand . " I rushed down and took the other side of the rascal . He was soaked to the bone and stank of rum . Though he hardly seemed able to keep his legs beneath him as we wrestled him up the stairs , he mumbled and growled , deep in his cups . " We are n't taking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly are . Mind your tongue , young man . He might 've perished in the street . " And such a shame that would 've been , I thought . But I held my tongue . Barnes had a habit of turning into a brutish lout after he 'd taken a few sips , going foul of mouth and mean of temper . However , he 'd fought at my father 's side in the second Afghan war . The way he told it , they 'd been great chums to the bitter end . I always reckoned him a liar on that score , but Mother was n't about to find fault with the man . From the very start , she 'd treated him like a regular member of the family . Not that she was gone over him . She had the good sense , at least , to reject his amorous advances ( so far as I know ) . Even after declining his marriage proposal some years ago , however , she 'd never turned him away from our door . And tonight , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where did you find him ? " I asked as we fought our way up the stairs . " He 'd fallen in a heap in front of the Boar 's Head . " " Ah , " said I. The pub was just at the corner . " He was likely waiting in ambuscade , and fell in his heap when he saw you coming along . " " Trevor ! " With that , I concentrated on the job at hand . Barnes grumbled and cursed all the while as we helped him into our flat . Mother responded with murmurs of " Poor fellow " and " You 're soaked through " and " You 'll catch your death for sure " and " What shall we do with you ? " What we did with him was remove his coat and settle him down on the sofa . It fell upon me to remove his sodden boots while Mother took off her own coat , then hurried off to make tea . I reckon it was her mistake , leaving me alone with him . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Muttering , really . I did n't expect a chap in his condition to hear me , much less comprehend . What I said was , " Bloody cur . " Quick as the words left my lips , his fist met my nose and sent me reeling backward . I dropped to the floor . In the next few moments , Barnes proved himself quite lively for a fellow far gone with drink . He bounded over to me , dropped onto my chest , and pounded me nearly senseless before Mother came running to my aid . " Rolfe ! " she shouted . He clubbed my face once more with his huge fist . Then he tumbled off as Mother tugged his hair . My mind all a fog , I tried to muster the strength to rise . But I could only lie there and watch while Barnes grabbed Mother 's wrist and scurried up . He pulled her to him and struck her face such a blow that it rocked her head sideways and sent spittle flying from her lips . Then he flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such force that she rammed it into the wall . On her knees before it , she lifted her head off the cushion and tried to push herself up . Barnes was already behind her . " Too good for me , is it ? " He swatted the back of her head . " You ' n ' your scurvy whelp ! " He smacked her head again and she cowered against the chair , burying her face in her arms . Barnes clutched the nape of her neck with one hand . With the other , he tore the back off her blouse . " No ! " Mother gasped . " Rolfe ! Please ! The boy ! " She tried to raise her head , but he cuffed it again . Then he tugged her underthings down to her waist , baring her back entirely . I was not so stunned by the several blows that I did n't flush with shame and outrage . " Stop it ! " I yelled , trying to get up . Ignoring me , Barnes snatched the heavy belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swung it . With a crack like a gunshot , it lashed my mother 's back . She let out a startled , hurt yelp . Across the creamy skin of her back was a broad , ruddy stripe . He got in two more licks . I had tears in my eyes as I swung the fireplace poker with all my strength . The iron rod caught him just above the ear and sent him stumbling sideways , the belt still raised overhead in readiness to strike another blow against Mother . He shouldered a wall , bounced off it , and dropped like a tree . I pranced around for a bit , kicking him . Then I realized he was knocked out and in no condition to appreciate my efforts , so I figured to finish him off . I straddled him , got a good grip on the poker , and was all set to stove in his skull when a shout stopped me . " Trevor ! No ! " Mother , suddenly standing before me , threw out an arm to ward off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave him be ! See what you 've done to him ! " With that , she fell to her knees at the scoundrel 's head and hunkered over him . I gazed at her poor back . The thick welts were blurry through my tears . Here and there , trickles of blood made bright red threads along her skin . " Thank the Lord , you have n't killed him . " " I jolly well shall . " She looked up at me . She said not a word . Nor was a word needed . I hurled the poker from my hand , then stepped away from the still body and wiped my eyes . I sniffed . The sore , wet feel of my nose got me to look down , and I found the front of my shirt soaked with blood . I dragged out a handkerchief to stop my nose from bleeding , then dropped into a chair . I would 've liked to tip back my head , but I dared not take my eyes off Barnes . Mother came to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully . " " He whipped you , Mum . " " It was the liquor , no doubt . He 's not an evil man . " " Evil enough , I should say . I do wish you 'd let me spill his brains . " " Such talk . " She ruffled my hair in a manner that seemed rather playful . " It comes of reading , no doubt . " " It comes of watching him whip you . " " Novels are wonderful things , darling , but you must remember they 're make-believe . It 's an easy matter to dispatch a villain in a story . He is n't flesh and blood , you see , he 's paper and ink . Spilling a bloke 's brains can be rather a lark . But that 's not life , m'dear . If you killed Rolfe , it would weigh on your soul like a cold , black hand . It would trouble you all your life , keeping you awake at night and tormenting you every day . " Well , she spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly mighty glad she 'd stopped me from dispatching Barnes . Though I was sure she 'd never killed a person , she knew deep in her heart about the burden of it . Since that time , I 've sent many a fellow to Hell . I 've lost more than a trifle of sleep over it . But the greater burdens on my soul do n't come from those I killed . They come because I did n't kill some rascals soon enough . Anyhow , Barnes was still among the breathing . It 'd be wrong to polish him off , or so we were both convinced at the time , but I got to worrying about what might befall us if he should wake up . When her lecture ran down , I got off my chair and said , " We 've got to do something about him , you know ? He 's likely to be at us again . " " I 'm afraid you 're right . " We both stared at him . So far , he had n't stirred . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing , " I said , and hurried off to my room . I returned a moment later with a pair of steel handcuffs , a Christmas gift from Uncle William who thought I 'd make a fine constable one day and wished to whet my appetite for the calling . Together , Mother and I rolled Barnes over . I brought his hands up behind his back and fastened the bracelets around his wrists . We stood up and admired our work . " That should do splendidly , " Mother said . " Shall I go out and fetch a Bobby ? " Her face darkened . She frowned and shook her head slowly from side to side . " He 'd be carted off to gaol for sure . " " That 's where he ought to be ! " " Oh , I 'd rather not have that . " " Mum ! He whipped you ! There 's no telling what mischief he 'd have done if I had n't bashed him . He must be dealt with . " She was silent for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She flinched once , probably due to the sorry state of her back . Finally , she said , " Bill would know what to do . " I liked the sound of that . Bill would know what to do , all right . Give him a peek at his sister 's back , and he would deal with Barnes in a most appropriate manner . " I 'll go and fetch him , " I said . Mother glanced at the clock on the mantel . So did I. It was nearly nine . " Best wait for morning , " she said . " He does n't go on duty till midnight . I 've plenty of time to catch him before he sets off . " " And there 's the rain . " " A drop of rain wo n't hurt me . " I tucked the bloody handkerchief back into my pocket , rushed across the floor and hefted the poker . " You keep this at hand , and do n't hesitate to use it . " Nodding , she accepted the poker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my ivory-handled folding knife-another gift from Uncle . I thought to offer it to Mother . A good sharp blade might be better than a poker for helping Barnes to mind his manners . However , I decided she might be loath to use such a deadly weapon , so I kept it for myself . And a good thing I did so . Later on , it was to save my life . When I returned to the front room , Barnes was still snoozing . I got into my coat . Mother gave me a few shillings . " Take a hansom , darling . " Then she forced an umbrella on me . She gave me a hasty kiss . I said , " Be careful now , Mum . Do n't trust him an inch . " Then I was on my way . Chapter Two I Set Out From the street , I gazed up at our bright , cheery windows and did n't mind the cold rain on my face . What I minded was leaving Mother with Barnes . I wished I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mother , being so good-hearted and forgiving , would take pity on him . She 'd want to ease his distress . Given half the chance , she 'd unlock the handcuffs so he could stretch his arms and get comfortable and take a sip of tea , and then he 'd be at her again . She might have a problem finding the key , however , as I had it in my trouser pocket . I was feeling a bit pleased about that when Mother came to one of the windows . Spying me , she raised a hand and wiggled her fingers . I waved back , never guessing this would be my last glimpse of her for many a year . Then I opened the umbrella and set off at a quick , splashy pace . It did n't take long to reach the cab rank at the corner of Baker Street and Dorset Street , where my eyes lit on the familiar , round figure of Daws . Glad to find him on duty , I hurried over to him . Daws and his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briar pipe turned upside down to keep out the rain , the other from its nostrils as it snorted .
