Roughly 40 feet from head to tail , an ancient reptile unearthed from the sands of the Sahara has earned the nickname Super Croc // We had never seen anything like it . With brushes and awls we teased away the rock encasing its fossilized jaws . Yet the animal that had once weilded these jaws was not a dinosaur . It was a colossal crocodilian . We had come to hunt dinosaur bones in the Sahara 's legendary fossil graveyard , a remote windswept stretch of rock and dunes called Gadoufaoua . In Tamashek , the language of the desert 's Tuareg people , Gadoufaoua means " the place where camels fear to tread . " For fossil hunters it means paradise-the richest dinosaurbeds on the African continent . Now less than an hour into our four-month expedition we were face-to-face with an ancient croc that could have posed a serious threat to any dinosaur within reach . This croc was n't new to science . some of its conical teeth , vertebrea , and foot-long armor plates , or scutes , were first discovered by French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Broin and fellow paleontologist Philippe taquet named the creature Sarcosuchus imperator , the " flesh crocodile emperor . " We called it SuperCroc . And we were hoping to answer some lingering questions about this little-described giant . Expedition 2000 , funded in part by the Society 's Expeditions council and its Committee for Research and Exploration , was my fourth to the Sahara , and it was no holiday in the sand . We had to transport trucks , tools , tents , five tons of plaster , 600 pounds of pasta , 4,000 gallons of water , and four months ' worth of other supplies into the heart of the world 's largest desert . Truck-engulfing sand , a trucker strike , and gas shortages cost precious time . But when , on August 30 , we finally reached the first of our four camp locations , we struck it fossil rich from the start . " The backbone ! " shouted David Blackburn , a student from the University of Chicago . Trenching around a large Sarcosuchus skull , he discovered a series of vertebrae snaking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Undeterred by the blistering heat , he and other members of my 16-person crew were closing in on beautifully preserved pieces of SuperCroc 's skeleton . " Gorgeous armor , " mused paleontologist Hans Larsson , examining a stack of foot-long bony scutes that looked like roofing tiles . These would have provided an impermeable shield over SuperCroc 's neck , back , and tail . Throughout their evolution all crocs have sported this body armor . It 's SuperCroc 's skull that 's unparalleled . More than a hundred teeth jut from narrow jaws that must have been adept at snagging fish . And unlike any other croc , living or extinct , SuperCroc 's skull gets wider toward the front end , which is armed with a deadly row of enlarged incisors . These robust bone-crushers suggest that Sarcosuchus could eat far meatier prey than fish . The swollen end of the snout houses an enormous cavity under the nostrils , meaning this croc may have had an enhanced sense of smell and a most unusual call . Its eye sockets project upward-like those of the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SuperCroc 's skull , then , is like a cross between the elongate skull of a fish-eating gharial and the robust skull of a bloodthirsty Nile crocodile . With the discovery on this expedition of several skulls , vertebrae , scutes , limb bones , and other assorted bits , we have amassed about 50 percent of SuperCroc 's skeleton , enough to commission a life-size model . Our most complete skull is just shy of six feet . After measuring the bones and comparing them with those of modern crocs , we estimate that a mature adult Sarcosuchus grew to about 40 feet long . Its weight ? As much as ten tons . Among the very largest crocs that ever lived , Sarcosuchus sprouted from a side branch of the crocodilian family tree separate from that leading to modern crocodiles . Dwarf crocs we discovered living alongside Sarcosuchus represent other lineages that have come and gone . Extinction has trimmed the largest and smallest of the croc family . Yet unlike dinosaurs , crocs today are much as they were more than a hundred million years ago-masters at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
