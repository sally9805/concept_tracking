A lot of things went right for Apolo Ohno during his 2002 Winter Olympic debut . On the ice he won gold and silver medals in short-track speed skating , propelling the popularity of the hypnotically dangerous sport , in which athletes whirl around a 111-m oval with no lane markers while wearing 10-in. razor blades on their feet . Off the ice his wisp of a soul patch and X Games ' tude helped him dominate the event known as Olympic buzz . He was so popular in Salt Lake City that even female fans wore fake Ohno patches ; afterward he was named one of PEOPLE 'S 50 Most Beautiful . The only thing that could have made his experience better was more medals  --  and fewer death threats . <P> The Olympics might have made Ohno a hero in the U.S. , but in South Korea he became a marked man when he was awarded the 1,500-m gold after Kim Dong Sung was disqualified for obstructing his path . ( While trying to pass Kim , Ohno made an exasperated gesture that helped draw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an obsession in Korea , and had Ohno been , say , Italian , his disputed victory might have made him a target of mere outrage . But at the time , tensions with U.S. soldiers based in Korea were escalating , and the undercurrent of anti-Americanism was hardly ameliorated by the fact that Ohno is half Japanese . Korea is a former Japanese colony , and many Koreans still feel deep resentment toward the country . <P> Any hope that the antipathy was restricted to an irrational few or might blow over after the Games disappeared . In a poll taken before Korea was a co-host of the 2002 soccer World Cup , Ohno topped Osama bin Laden as the person Koreans least wanted to attend . Neither showed . <P> For nearly four years , it was n't safe for Ohno to skate in Korea , but in October he arrived in Seoul for a short-track World Cup event . At the airport he was greeted by 100 police in riot gear ( for his protection ) , and at the rink he was disqualified for pushing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone more smoothly . " No death threats while I was in Korea nor leading up to the competition , " says Ohno . " Actually , a very high-ranking Korean speed-skating official was telling me that I may have sparked a fan club ! How cool is that ? " <P> Not everyone in Korea is sold on Ohno . " I know that the Korean public wants revenge , " says top Olympic challenger Ahn Hyun Soo . But Ahn insists he wants to beat Ohno only because the American is the top dog , not because he 's American . <P> Ohno remains a medal favorite in each of short track 's three individual events , although he 'll face tough competition from Ahn , China 's Li Jiajun and Canada 's Mathieu Turcotte . Still , in a sport that 's dangerous enough , here 's hoping the scariest action in Torino stays on the ice .
