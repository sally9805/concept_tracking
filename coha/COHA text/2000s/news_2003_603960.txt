<p> NOVATO , Calif.  --  Can a tiny company rooted in the Woodstock Generation make the transition from hippie to hipster ? <p> Birkenstock , best known for the ubiquitous suede sandals worn by iconoclasts and counterculture types , is taking steps to find out . It will soon target young , urban fashionistas with the spring rollout of an edgy , fashion-forward line of $ 240-and-up designer footwear . <p> Birkenstock 's Architect line is part of a blueprint to broaden the company 's image from the funky , antifashion symbol for leftwing tree huggers into the kind of glove-leather , designer footwear the shoe-obsessed , ultra-cool Carrie Bradshaw might wear strolling down Madison Avenue in HBO 's Sex and the City . <p> The concept is n't far-fetched . Birkenstock already has legions of rich and famous fans , from Gulf War Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf to Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow . Supermodel Heidi Klum is developing a limited-edition Birkenstock line . Birkenstock USA , the German footwear maker 's U.S. distributor and marketing Svengali , already markets more than 400 styles of clogs , dress shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patent leather more suitable for fashion runways than mosh pits . <p> Birkenstock USA also wants to expand its children 's market and " professional " class shoes aimed at surgeons , chefs and others who stand for long hours . Increasingly , there 's talk of extending the brand into athletic shoes , hiking shoes , even apparel . <p> " The challenge is getting beyond the hippie image , " says Birkenstock USA CEO Matt Endriss . " There 's a huge opportunity to increase our position in the marketplace . " <p> Just how well  --  and if  --  Birkenstock succeeds as a fashionmeister remains unclear . It 's credited with inspiring the U.S. market for comfort footwear , but despite its seven-year diversification effort , the company is still widely perceived as a marketer of clunky sandals . The edgy Architect line is designed to accelerate an image makeover . But Birkenstock is treading cautiously so it does n't alienate loyalists who consider its footwear more health product than fashion statement . <p> A broader problem might be the competitive casual footwear market itself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from sports sandals and athletic shoes to clogs and slip-ons . In an industry where growth has long been flat , casual footwear has become sharply competitive . <p> Big marketers such as Nike and rivals are offsetting sluggish sales of athletic shoes with casual crossovers and hybrid styles . Bootmaker Merrell pioneered sport footwear such as moccasins . It and rivals such as Timberland have turned to sandals on the heels of successful upstarts such as Teva . Cheap private-label makers and high-end designers aim for opposite ends of the market . Competition is still growing : Designer Perry Ellis just announced its own footwear line . <p> Easy to trip <p> In this sector , missteps are rampant . Even big players have stumbled trying lure young consumers , whose fashion tastes are fickle and fast-changing . " You can have a huge hit for a year or two . But when you 're dealing with fashion-driven items , the tide can literally turn overnight , " says Footwear News editorial director Michael Atmore . " There is n't a brand that has n't had some ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely by hype , celebrity endorsements and big marketing campaigns , which could be problematic for Birkenstock USA . The company has spent virtually nothing on mainstream national advertising since it was started by former seamstress Margot Fraser in 1966 . <p> Birkenstock is planning magazine ads this spring . But with 2002 sales of just $ 110 million , the privately held company 's marketing budget remains minuscule . Nike , with 2002 sales of $ 10.1 billion , spends more than $ 500 million annually on marketing . <p> Industry tracker NPD Research ranks Birkenstock No. 4 in the $ 430 million sport-sandal market , 18th in the $ 4.8 billion active casual market . But it has relied largely on word-of-mouth for success . While sandals remain Birkenstock USA 's best-selling line , closed-toe footwear now accounts for 40% of U.S. sales . <p> Employees say they get lots of " I did n't know they were Birkenstocks " comments from people when they venture away from company headquarters in the Marin County foothills . <p> That 's the prime reason for the Architect line , designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts believe is mostly middle-age . Far sleeker and stylish than the bulk of Birkenstock 's offerings , Architect footwear has the same contoured suede-and-cork foot beds created for their orthopedic benefits that have been central to Birkenstock shoes for more than 200 years . But they are more sculpted and contemporary than virtually anything Birkenstock has previously marketed . <p> For years , strong sales and rising profits offset management 's inexperience and operating inefficiencies . Fraser has little formal business training or education . World War II forced her to drop out of her German grade school . In laid-back Marin County , Fraser 's management style was more maternal caretaker than as a manager focused on the bottom line . <p> " Essentially , the philosophy had been if we have a good product and do a good job and treat people right , we 'll grow and prosper , " says Birkenstock COO Gene Kunde . <p> Fraser became a New Age marketer almost by accident after discovering the German-made sandals in 1966 while vacationing in Europe . Within weeks , her chronic foot pain vanished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , " she says . <p> Figuring the sandals would appeal to American women , she arranged shipments with the Birkenstock family , which has made footwear since 1774 . Traditional shoe retailers balked at the sandals ' unconventional design . She sold them mostly from her garage they drew the interest of health food store retailers at a convention in 1967 . <p> Birkenstocks did n't attract major attention until Generation Xers and baby boomers embraced the shift to casual wear in the late 1980s . From 1992 to 1994 , Birkenstock USA sold more footwear than it had the prior two decades . <p> Problems surfaced in 2001 , when a big retail client folded , costing Birkenstock USA $ 1 million in lost inventory and more in projected sales . Coupled with costs for new computer equipment , Birkenstock USA posted just its second profitless year . Fraser , 73 , began phasing into retirement . <p> " The company decided to get serious , " says Kunde , named Birkenstock 's first COO in July 2001 . Managers have since been appointed to oversee information technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those with more traditional business expertise are awed that the undermanaged company operated so well for so long . <p> Yet , to some , the pace of change remains frustratingly slow . A telling point : Birkenstock has no clear marketing data on its clientele . " We know very little about our customers and their motivation to buy our shoes , " says newly hired brand communications manager Tony Maniscalco . " It 's still a mystery who our customers are and why some markets , like Birmingham , Ala. , are strong . " <p> Sweeping managerial and infrastructure changes have heightened fears among longtime workers that Birkenstock is becoming too commercial and corporate , eroding the feel-good atmosphere . There are more sports cars and SUVs than VW microbuses in the corporate parking lot these days , and the company 's sprawling 136,000-square-foot warehouse looks no different than those in any industrial park . <p> But behind the warehouse lies a garden plot where workers can grow organic vegetables . Employees are encouraged to spend four hours a month on charitable or non-profit work  --  on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a gentle reminder to do good deeds . Even before the company became fully employee-owned earlier this year , workers were encouraged to ask questions and speak their mind . <p> " We 're trying to clarify who we are and where we want to go , " says Daniela Zazzeron , head of Employee Resources &; Development . " But we 're trying to protect our culture while looking at new ways of doing things . " <p> Architect might be considered risky by some , but at worst , it is an inexpensive way to attract brand attraction , Endriss says . Birkenstock has also stepped up relatively cheap product placements in fashion shows , magazines and films . " We 're not afraid to reinvent ourselves , " says Endriss . " But how we arrive at growth and strategy , and how it affects people here is important . We 've always been about a sense of belonging as much as selling a product . " <p> Retail support <p> Longtime Birkenstock retailers applaud the company 's moves . " They still act like kids stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Lance De St. Croix , who owns five Birkenstock outlets in Virginia and Minnesota . " But they could be on the verge of being a monster company . " <p> Internal issues and market competition aside , Birkenstock has prestige and appeal greater than annual sales suggest . That reputation could help the Architect line attract the younger , hipper consumers Birkenstock is targeting without the large marketing outlay big marketers use to raise brand profile . <p> " Birkenstock 's developed a cult-like following because they are more about a lifestyle than marketing , and they 've stayed true to that , " says NPD analyst Marshal Cohen . " For them , the real issue is going to be expanding beyond the stigma the brand has . "
