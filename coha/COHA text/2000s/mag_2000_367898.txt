When Sushmita Sen , the first Indian to be chosen Miss Universe , made her triumphant return to the subcontinent after the 1994 pageant , there were victory processions , gala parties and countless interviews . For fans like Yukta Mookhey , a teenager growing up in a middle-class suburb of Bombay , Sushmita was living a dream : she had been wrenched from an ordinary life and forged by the blast furnace of glamour and fame into a celebrity . Yukta , then 15 , told her family that she too would one day wear a glittering crown . Her parents smiled at her adolescent fantasies , talked about college and dismissed the whimsical ambition . But Yukta sulked and threw tantrums and eventually persuaded her father to support her participation in the 1999 Miss India contest . She won that title and later became Miss World , planting fantasies , no doubt , in the minds of other teenage Indian girls . Now those kids have even more inspiration to draw from .

Now , conservative middle-class dads urge their daughters into bikinis , and moms put them on high-protein diets intended ( perhaps naively ) to help them achieve the ramp-mandatory 5-ft. 7-in. height requirement . The organizer of the annual Miss India contest , the Times of India group of newspapers and magazines , reports receiving applications by the sackful . Eventually , 600 hopefuls will be chosen for the elimination rounds , and just 30 will make it to the final show . But the deluge of applicants continues . " People have definitely become very , very aspirational , " says Pradeep Guha , president of the Times group , who decides on the shortlist .

Once noticed , the young women immediately find a place in the world of modeling and acting . Pageant sponsors often offer lucrative endorsement deals . Several beauty queens are now top movie stars in Bollywood . <P> But for every successful Yukta or Lara who goes on to tear-drenched smiles as she receives her bouquet and tiara , thousands of other hopefuls end up humiliated and exploited . More and more young men and women are signing up with costly , dubious Indian modeling institutes , where a two-week session and a photo portfolio can run up to $1,000 . The desire to break through to the beauty elite can force women into unsavory situations . Anorexia and steroid abuse are increasing . There are many stories of fixed contests , nepotism and the casting couch . " Most of our people are out-of-towners , " says Atul Kelkar , a manager of Smiles , a Bombay model-training agency . " I tell them that the amount of trouble you get into is directly proportional to your desperation . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
