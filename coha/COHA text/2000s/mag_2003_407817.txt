This summer , TV is better the second time around . Here 's a sampling of series worth catching on the flip side . // AS YOU MAKE YOUR SUMMER READING list-complete with those thicker , more challenging books you 've been putting off , plus a couple of hard-boiled-mystery or chick-litty beach reads-do n't forget to consider the dramas washing ashore on your TV . There 's an evolution under way in how hour-long shows ' plots unfold ( watching the " story arc " reruns of , say , NYPD Blue , usually aired out of order , now seems antiquated to the point of absurdity ) , and summer programming makes this sun-glaringly clear . You can relax with old classics , discover new passions ( I think you 're already catching on to this : Reruns of one of the shows recommended below , Without a Trace , are outdrawing ER replays ) , and get hooked on a guilty pleasure or two . This season 's scripted programming , to be sure , is dominated by reruns , with the notable exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . If you 're looking for complex narratives with nuanced characterizations , you-to quote Otis Redding-got to , got to , got to get into this show , which I 'm not going to sugarcoat : great characters , great acting , but damn hard to follow . Think of it as Ulysses in Baltimore . For those in search of something a little less knotty , here 's a sample of the broadcast networks ' second-run , first-rate fare . Boomtown Reruns on TNT , Mondays , 10 p.m . When this rookie series began last fall Sundays on NBC , it got a lot of hype for its style of storytelling-recounting a plot from several points of view , including those of Gary Basaraba 's jovially tough cop and Neal McDonough 's steely-eyed deputy DA , David McNorris . The show got modest ratings : You could sense viewers thought Boomtawn was going to be one of those ostentatiously schmancy shows , confusing for its own stylistic sake , and who wants a headache on Sunday night ? I felt the same way : The plots seemed excessively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the season progressed , Boomtown de-emphasized the multi-POV format and concentrated on its most interesting characters . By the time McNorris started drinking too much and got involved in a hit-and-run car accident ( he ended the season headed to the Betty Ford clinic ) , I was hooked . You 'll be too , if you start watching now and follow Boomtown into its second , presumably migraine-free season in the fall , when it moves to Fridays at 10 p.m. on NBC . Alias ABC , Sundays , 9 p.m . Come on , America : Start zooming in on network TV 's most pleasurably intricate , witty hour . Here 's my theory about why Jennifer Garner can get her spandexed curves plastered all over every publication from EW to Femme Fatales ( go to a bigger newsstand , bub ) and still not win its time slot : Alias suffers from Buffy Syndrome-people think any series with a sexy gal at its center is exploitative or adolescent . But bless creator J.J. Abrams ' hummingbird-fast beating heart ; his pulp-espionage plots are bracingly byzantine . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cast as Garner 's mom , Abrams supplied the kind of maturity that gives sex symbols a good name . He also streamlined the show to emphasize action , emotion , family dynamics , and puzzles you can solve . It 's like finishing a crossword while sitting in an Adirondack chair , sipping a gin and tonic . The Amazing Race 4 CBS , Thursdays , 8 p.m . Okay , technically , Race is n't in reruns , but like the rest of these shows , the fourth installment of real-life pairs hustling across the globe has yet to earn the significant following it deserves . Am I actually listing a reality show among complex and nuanced scripted programming ? You bet . So far , I 've been totally caught up in the way calm Chuck deals with his asthmatic , crabby , supercompetitive girlfriend of 12 years , Millie , and as if coping with strangers ' foreign languages to get directions were n't enough stress for them , the show constantly reminds us they 're still virgins ( by the genre 's standards , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the self-described fat , middle-aged air-traffic controllers were eliminated , I rooted for Tian and Jaree ( so dumb and hateful to each other , they provided endless amusement ) . Now that they 've been left in the dust ( or East Indian bull dung ) , I 'm hoping for some suitably grueling loss for Reichen and Chip ( the unambiguously gay duo anxious to prove their hyper-athleticism by springing shiftless , like dolphins with pecs , from a pool in the opening credits ) , who whine and verbally whop the other couples . My allegiance goes to the circus clowns Jon and Al , who 've never met a plane ticket they ca n't balance on their noses . Nay vote : David and Jeff , bland dumbos who thought their Indian cab driver 's name was " Money . " Innocents abroad-Mark Twain would be proud . American Dreams NBC , Sundays , 8 p.m. , restarts Aug. 3 This saga of a ' ' 60s family started out gimmicky : Pillowy-soft star Brittany Snow finds happiness as an American Bandstand dancer and squeals as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lesley Gore . But it ended up bracingly honest , with race as a flashpoint . Dreams succeeded as it gradually moved away from the immediate family and increased the roles of the supporting cast , such as Henry ( the shrewdly guarded Jonathan Adams ) , a black man who works at the appliance shop owned by Snow 's father ( Tom Verica ) . The writers dramatized the dilemmas faced by a middle-aged African American caught between the polarizing civil rights philosophies of Martin Luther King Jr . and Malcolm X. Dreams also turned Gail O'Grady from an NYPD Blue bimbo into a believable mom , and featured the year 's heppest boyfriend , bespectacled Luke ( Jamie Elman ) , who sneered at the British Invasion and turned Snow 's Meg on to acoustic Bob Dylan . He was myopic in more ways than one ( he 'll learn next season , one hopes , how much Dylan dug the Beatles ) , but he helped make this underviewed series a keeper . NEXT UP ARE THE TV EQUIVALENTS OF ' ' ' BEACH READS , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for the most part ) resolve their conflicts in 60 tidy minutes-self-contained tales that satisfy like the short chapters in a lightweight best-seller , or a good short story . Among this off-season 's standouts : Without a Trace CBS , Thursdays , 10 p.m . Jerry Bruckheimer , who produces Amazing Race , Trace , and its lead-in , CSI , makes brainier TV than he does feature films ( his upcoming Cold Case , leading out of 60 Minutes on CBS this fall , will , I predict , continue his streak ) . Trace 's lead , Anthony LaPaglia , is a terrific actor who deftly holds himself back to convey jaded experience as Agent Jack Malone , and the show 's signature opening scene-the moment when the victim just fades from the screen , in a ghostlike mirage shot-perfectly matches his eerie , alluring calm . As for CBS ' other crime-scene success CSI : Miami-sorry , it may be a ratings success , but the climate change from dry , hot Las Vegas to humid , hot Miami aside , it simply has n't managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the next shows do ... The Law &; Order Franchise Whether it 's SVU ( Fridays , 10 p.m . ) , CI ( Sundays , 9 p.m. ) , or the Sam Waterston-starring Crispy Original ( Wednesdays , 10 p.m. ) , exec producer Dick Wolf says NEC 's L &O; is all about the story . But , some 400 episodes later , it 's also about the comforts of structure ( discovery , investigation , and prosecution of crime : bang , bing , boom ) , the bit parts ( hey , finally a good use for Sandra Bernhard 's sour pucker as a guest-starring defense lawyer on SVU ) . And sorry , Dick-about the stars : Waterston 's voice and throat wattle have grown more angry-quivery year by year , and I ca n't wait until CI 's Kathryn Erbe finally has it up to here with Vincent D'Onofrio 's hambone camera hogging . Be sure to watch the actress in reruns as she gets steadily more fed up with her minimal dialogue , " cause I think she 's gon na blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' down ! <p>
