Section : Money &; Investing MONEY MEN Drugs for deadly hepatitis C do n't work too well . T. Rowe Price 's Kris H. Jenner and Jay Markowitz are looking for the drug firms that can fix the problem <p> Fever , chills , fatigue , depression . These are just four of the side effects of interferon , a standard drug used to treat the liver disease hepatitis C. The cure can feel worse than the disease . And the remedy is n't guaranteed to cure you . Interferon and other drugs work on less than half of the people with the strain of hepatitis C most common in this country . <p> Some 170 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C , including 4 million in the U.S. Around 80% do n't have symptoms , which means most people do n't even know they 're infected . But after sometimes 20 years , chronic hepatitis C can cause jaundice , nausea and abdominal pain . It can also lead to liver cancer , cirrhosis and severe liver disease . Hepatitis C kills an estimated 8,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealthy virus is transmitted through contact with an infected person 's blood  --  whether through illegal drug use , tattooing , sex , cuts and scrapes or even using someone else 's razor or toothbrush . That 's distinct from another common form of the disease , hepatitis A , which takes a fecal-oral route via food or household objects . There , the infection is usually obvious right away . <p> In the 1980s , before blood donor screening for hepatitis C began , as many as 240,000 people a year in the U.S. became infected with the disease , estimates the Centers for Disease Control &; Prevention . That has fallen dramatically since to 26,000 new infections annually . But that 's still a lot . <p> Because existing treatments have such a low cure rate and sometimes unbearable side effects , biotech and pharmaceutical companies have been racing to develop a new generation of better drugs . " The hottest area in drug development right now and for the next couple years is hepatitis C , " says Kris H. Jenner , who runs the $1.7 billion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winner is going to have an extraordinary increase in value because the market is so significant . " <p> Jenner 's fund has prospered in part by investing in some of the companies pursuing new hepatitis C drugs , but the bigger payoff is likely yet to come . The no-load mutual fund has a five-year annualized return of 8.3% ( versus a 1.7% return for the S &P; 500 ) . Yearly fees are a not-bad 0.91% of assets . <p> A physician himself , Jenner , 44 , knows what he is doing . He had completed four years of residency in surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1997 when he left medicine to join another Baltimore institution , fund powerhouse T. Rowe Price . He has run the Health Sciences Fund since 2000 . <p> Another doc , Jay Markowitz , 43 , a biotechnology analyst and vice president at T. Rowe Price , works with Jenner at the fund . He has witnessed hep C 's gruesome effects in person . As a surgeon Markowitz performed liver transplants before joining T. Rowe in 2002 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease exacts a tremendous human and economic toll , " he says . <p> Jenner cautions that it 's still early in the development of the new hepatitis C drugs and that the stock price of companies working on them will likely be extremely volatile for the next two years . " Anytime you have a new area of therapy unfolding , " he says , " people 's expectations can run the gamut from extreme optimism and giddiness to overly despondent . " <p> The ones who persevere and find more effective therapies are likely to be big winners , says Jenner . With better treatments , global spending on hepatitis C drugs could grow from the current $2.5 billion a year to as much as $10 billion in 2012 , predicts Geoffrey Porges , a Sanford C. Bernstein senior analyst . <p> That promise has prompted Jenner and Markowitz to invest in firms that are usually deep in the red , typical of biotech outfits . <p> The drugs now used by hepatitis C patients  --  a combination of pegylated interferon and an antiviral pill called ribavirin  --  attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pegylation is the combining of a drug with the polymer polyethylene glycol , in order to make it last longer in the bloodstream . ) How vexing for folks with the most common strain of hepatitis C ( genotype 1 , infecting 70% of U.S. hep C patients ) that a yearlong treatment regimen of ribavirin pills and weekly injections of interferon cures the disease just 40% to 50% of the time . Some ca n't tolerate the flulike side effects and have to stop the treatment early . <p> Human Genome Sciences is developing a drug , Albuferon , a combination of the human protein albumin and interferon . This combo stays in the body longer than interferon and thus can be injected less often , every two weeks and possibly every four weeks . " The acute side effects of interferon tend to happen right after dosing , " says Markowitz . Patients in a midstage trial of Albuferon reported better quality of life , although the experiment is still at an interim stage . <p> In June Human Genome Sciences partnered with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug outside the U.S. Of course , the risk for investors is that late-stage clinical trials could show it to be a flop . <p> Like many biotechnology companies , Human Genome Sciences has minimal revenues ( $19 million last year ) and huge losses ( $239 million ) . By the company 's reckoning , replacing existing interferon with its Albuferon , if that drug is approved , could add $2 billion a year to revenues . <p> Another approach to combating hep C is to stop the virus from replicating by attacking enzymes that let it do so . Thus far the most promising new class of such enzyme-attacking drugs looks to be protease inhibitors , best known for combating the progress of HIV infections in the body . <p> The leader in the pack with protease inhibitors for the hepatitis virus , say Markowitz and Jenner , is Vertex Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge , Mass . Data from a small , midstage clinical trial with its protease inhibitor , known as vx-950 or telaprevir , were " nothing short of spectacular , " says Markowitz . The 12 patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribavirin showed no sign of the virus after four weeks of treatment . Also , 24 of 26 patients who received telaprevir in early-stage trials were cured of hepatitis C after six additional months of treatment with interferon and ribavirin . <p> In June Vertex signed a deal with Johnson &; Johnson to codevelop telaprevir , in which J &J; obtained most foreign rights for the drug . Vertex lost $203 million on $161 million in revenues last year . Vertex shares have quadrupled in value over the past two years on optimism about its drug . <p> Not all the hep C pioneers are small biotechs . Schering-Plough is an established player in the treatment of hepatitis C with its interferon drug , PEG-Intron , which brought in $751 million in sales last year , and a ribavirin drug called Rebetol . Jenner and Markowitz are watching Schering-Plough 's development of a protease inhibitor , as well . <p> Right now that drug does n't look as potent as Vertex 's drug , based on the limited data available , says Markowitz . Schering-Plough , which has a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Dr. Scholl 's foot care products , earned $269 million on sales of $9.5 billion last year . It trades at 34 times trailing earnings . <p> InterMune of Brisbane , Calif. partnered with Swiss pharmaceutical titan Roche to work on several of InterMune 's protease inhibitors , one of which is expected to begin clinical trials in humans before the end of this year . With no trial data yet , it 's too early for Jenner or Markowitz to make a call on the drugs ' likelihood of success . Yet they view this long shot as worth owning now . InterMune 's market capitalization is $731 million . <p> Three other companies that Jenner and Markowitz own are working on a different class of enzyme-attacking drugs called polymerase inhibitors . In August ViroPharma of Exton , Pa. said data from an early-stage trial of its polymerase inhibitor reduced the virus 99% on average after 14 days of treatment in combination with interferon . Idenix Pharmaceuticals partnered with Novartis on its polymerase inhibitor , nm283 . Markowitz says the drug has modest potency , but is undergoing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better results . Roche , which already sells pegylated interferon ( Pegasys ) and ribavirin ( Copegus ) , announced in May that in a small early-stage trial its polymerase inhibitor was effective in significantly reducing the viral load . Markowitz says that based only on preliminary data , the Roche drug appears to be more potent than Idenix 's drug , but it has to be given in high doses . Still , he is hopeful . And so is everybody connected with curing this dread malady . Who Will Find the Wonder Drug ? <p> T. Rowe 's health fund managers think these companies have the potential to find the better hep C remedy . The obvious downside , They may not .
