Sarai was ten years old when she saw him first . She was mistress of the distaff that day , and was proud of the steadiness of her spinning , the even quality of the yarn she drew from the spindle . She had a gift for closing off the outside world , hearing nothing but the words that raced through her own mind , seeing nothing but woolen fibers as she transformed them into yarn . And today she worked with wool of the finest white , for it would be woven undyed into the bridal dress of her sister Qira . Into the yarn , from time to time , she added a red-gold hair plucked from her own head . It would be almost invisible , yet in the sunlight there would be the slightest sheen of color in the dress . Her sister would be embraced by Sarai even as she was given to her husband ; a part of Sarai would go with her to the distant places where she would live . A desert man , a wanderer . What was Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of an ancient priestly lineage . " There 's power in their blood , " Father said . " My grandchildren will have it . " As if Father were not the rightful king of Ur , with plenty of godly power in his own blood . The difference was that Father still lived in a city , with many servants around him , while this desert man lived in a tent and surrounded himself with goats and sheep . Let us buy his wool , Father , and pay for it with olive oil , not with the life of my dear sister , my truest friend ! As she thought of words she wanted to say , her eyes filled with tears and she had to stop the spindle , lest she mar the yarn through her blindness . Only now , with her spinning stopped , did she notice the flurry of voices at the door . " Then come to the courtyard ! My younger daughter will draw you water from the cistern . " Father 's voice . Which meant that Sarai was the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid aside distaff , wool , and yarn , and blinked her eyes to clear them . Two feet stood before her , greyish-white with the dust of travel , creased and cracked from the dry air . She had never seen feet so weary-looking . " I 'm afraid I 've interrupted you , " said a voice . A gentle voice , pitched so only she could hear . But also a strong voice , full of confidence . Already she knew that she wanted her name to be spoken by this man , so she could hear the sound of it spoken with such authority and yet such kindness . If the gods could speak , this would be the voice of a god . " Sir , " she said , " will you have water from our cistern ? " " I would have water from your hands , " said the man , " since you are to become my sister . " At once the tears leapt back into Sarai 's eyes . This must be the desert man , her sister 's husband-to-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ! Who but a desert wanderer would have feet like these ? And he smelled like goats and donkeys ! But his voice ... I do n't want to see his face , she thought . For what if he is beautiful , so my sister will love him and not be sorry to leave me ? And what if he is ugly , and I have to be afraid for her , going off into the desert with a monster ? " I will draw water for you , sir . " Not looking up , she strode to the cisternwalking boldly , so he would know she did not fear him , though she would not raise her eyes to see him . She climbed the short ladder and pulled upward on the waterdoor . She could hear water gurgling out of the cistern , splashing down into the jar . It would take much to wash those feet , so she left the water flowing until she could hear the pitch of the falling water begin to rise , telling her the jar was growing full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it slid downward and closed off the flow from the cistern . When she had climbed down , she turned to the jar and , to her surprise , looked the stranger in the face . For instead of standing , he had sat down on the tiles of the courtyard and now looked , smiling , up into her eyes . " You 're so serious at your task , " he said . Was he mocking her ? " I 'm not serious when I play , " she said , " but I prefer to work . There 's pride in work , when it 's done well . And someone gets the use of it . " She ladled water out of the jar and poured it over his feet . The dust on his legs turned into black mud , and then into slime . He immediately put his hands right in it , scrubbing away the dirt . Ubude , the courtyard servant , at once protested . " Sir , it is for my hands to wash your feet . " " Your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean as the king 's dishes . Whereas my hands need washing almost as much as my feet do . " " And your face , " said Sarai . The words came out of her before she realized how outrageous they were . She blushed . " Ah ! " cried the man . " My face ! I must be as pretty as a locust . " He held out his hands to her . She poured water into his cupped hands , and he splashed it at once on his own face . And again . And again . Only then did he take the linen cloth from Ubude 's hand and vigorously rub his cheeks and brow . When he pulled the towel away and revealed his face to her , his eyes were crossed and his mouth deformed into a grotesque shape . " Better ? " he asked . She could n't help it . She had to laugh . " A little , " she said . He rubbed again with the towel . This time he made a much more threatening face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure it will help . " He held out his hands all the same , and she poured more into them , and he washed again , and now when the towel came away , he was grinning . It was the face of a god , his eyes so bright , his smile so warm , his cheek so golden with sunlight . " I see that my sister will do well , " said Sarai . She said it politely , but inside , her heart was breaking . Qira will forget me quickly , with this man as her husband . " She will do well , " said the man , " and better than you think . For I am not Lot . I 'm only Lot 's uncle , come with the bride-price for your father and to help prepare for the wedding . Lot is much better looking . " " His uncle ? " asked Sarai . " But you 're so young . He must be a child . " " He 's the son of my elder brother Haran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lot grew up in my father 's tent , as if he were my own brother . He is my brother , in truth , since my father adopted himand more to the point , he 's the same age as me . Twenty years in the world our gracious Lord has given us . " " I 'm ten , " said Sarai , wondering even as she said it why she imagined that he would care . " Before your age is doubled , I expect I 'll be coming back for you . " " Why ? Have you another nephew ? " He laughed at that as if it were the cleverest thing she could have said . She had no idea why . " No more nephews , " he said . " But still these two feet , much in need of washing . " She poured more water as Father came into the courtyard , followed by servants carrying cups of beer and a basket of bread . " Barley for the traveler , " said Father . He took one cup from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " If the elder daughter is as pretty as the younger , " said the visitor , " my brother Lot will be the happiest man in the world . " Sarai was astonished . No one spoke of her as pretty . " Oh , now , do n't be getting thoughts , " said Father . " The younger is already spoken for . " " Before the elder ? " asked the visitor . " Spoken for by the goddess Asherah . " At once the visitor 's face was transformed into a mask of rage . This was no game of making faces with a child , either . " You mean to slay this child ? " " Abram ! " said Father . " You misunderstand me ! She is marked to be a priestess . One daughter of the king 's house has always tended a shrine of Asherah . " Abram was his name . His body relaxed a little , but he was still upset , Sarai could see it . " Even though you live six days upriver from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The duty of kings does not end just because the gods are pleased to let another have our throne . A king is a priest before he is a king , and he still must intercede for his people , even if he no longer rules them . What right would I have to return to the throne of ancient Ur , if I slack in my duty now , with my people under the harsh rule of the Amorite ? " Sarai poured another ladle of water over Abram 's feet and lower legs . The dark slime was almost gone , and the bronze color of his sunworn skin was visible now . His legs were strongthis man ran as much as he rode . " You speak the truth , " said Abram . " But God does not ask parents to give their children to him . He asks people to give themselves , by their own free choice . " " Well , " said Father , " it 's not as if we 're going to force her . But she was god-chosen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced before she walked . " " One can be chosen by God , and yet still marry and raise children . The soul with many children is rich , though there is no bread , and the one without is poor , though there is oil enough to bathe in . " This idea struck Sarai like a thunderclap . Who had ever heard such a thing ? Marriage was fine , and these princes of the desert had their own sort of prestige . But to be a priestess of Asherah was the highest work of all . She would make music in the temple and sing before the goddess and minister in her holy name . Yet this man seemed not to understand it . No , he understoodhe simply did not believe it . " Sarai , " said Father , " I fear that our visitor is too weary for company right now . " " I have spoken too boldly , " said Abram . " I did not mean to give offense . But you see , your news came as a surprise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return in ten years to marry her . " Sarai dropped the ladle . To marry her ? That was what he meant when he said that he 'd be coming back ? " My daughter is normally graceful , " said Father . " But lookyou 've made her clumsy . Leave the ladle , Sarai . Go inside with your spinning . " Still blushing , Sarai strode to her distaff , gathered up wool and yarn and all , and rushed into the house . But she did not stay indoorsit was too dark for good work , was n't it ? In moments she was on the roof looking down into the courtyard . Without quite planning it , she found herself positioned so that Father 's back was to her and she could see the face of this earnest stranger , this Abram , who had been so furious when he thought that Father meant to slay her in sacrifice to Asherah . It was as if he thought himself fit to judge a god . To judge a king in his own house ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry me ? No matter . Sarai knew her life 's work . It had no marriage in it . But such a man as this . Filthy from travel , yes . But there was a light inside him that even the dust of the desert could not hide . Everyone in Ur-of-the-North treated Father with great respect and honor , even though he was a king without a city . But this Abram did not need to have others give him his honor . He carried it within himself . He was more a king , arriving filthy from the desert , than Father was , here in his fine house . The disloyalty of this thought made Sarai blush with shame . She would never speak it aloud . But she would never deny it , either . If the desert is traveled by such men as this , no wonder they are fit husbands for the daughters of kings . * * * Qira was born to be a queen , and this marriage covenant with a desert man was the disaster of her life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city full of talk about a desert priest named Terah , Qira had to fight to stay awake . Why would Father bore her with talk about some Amorite who claimed a special kinship with Ba'al ? It was Sarai who was going to be a priestess . Qira was going to be a queen ! So when Father said , " And I want you to marry his heir , Lot , the son of his eldest son , " Qira did not quite understand . " Whom ? " she asked . " You want me to what ? " " Marry him . Terah 's grandson , the heir to his great and ancient priesthood . Not to mention the greater portion of his flocks and herds . " " Marry him ? What city is he king of ? " " Not king of any one city . He says that the Ba'al of one city is only a statue that reminds us of the true Lord , who has a true name known only to a few , written in signs known to none outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resist throwing some of Father 's own teachings back in his face . " ' It 's an arrogant man who says that the worship of others is false , and only his own is true . ' " Father shook his head . " Daughter , theirs is the lineage of Utnapishtim , who rode above the flood . What is the royalty of a mere city , compared to him who is priest to all the world ? " " If they do n't live in a city , how are they any better than the wandering Amorites ? " " The Amorites are barbarians who raid from the desert and destroy what they can not conquer . As we know to our sorrow . " " What cities has this Terah conquered ? " " He is no Amorite , that is my point , Qira . There is no need for him to conquer cities , when he is the chief priest of God in the world ! " " Father , " said Qira , " with all respect , I must still point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said to you , and it does n't make him a king unless there are people somewhere who obey him . " Father 's face turned red then , and Qira realized that in denigrating this Terah , she had said the unspeakable thing : She had denied that a king without a city could truly be a king . " I did not mean ... " But there was no way she could put a good face on what she had said . " Very well , " said Father . " Let me speak no more of priests and kings . Let me speak of money . A real prince , to marry you , would demand a dowry , and we have no dowry for you , living as we do on the gifts of my brother , king of Ur-of-the-North . While this Terah is rich in herds , and promises me a very sizeable bride-price for you . " " Everyone knows the Amorites trade in slaves , " said Qira savagely , " but I never thought you would sell your own daughter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father coldly , " you would n't be worth two shoats , since you do no work and have no skills . " " Should I callus my fingers with spinning , like a common woman ? " " Your sister is not ashamed . " " Sarai is born to be a temple servant . I am born to be consort to a king ! " " And I was born to rule a great city , " said Father . " We do n't always live the life we were born for . Would you rather marry some tradesman who will put you in the house behind his shop and trot you out to show his visitors that he has married royalty ? " " Once you decide that my shame can be purchased for money , what difference does it make ? " At once she saw that she had goaded Father too far . " Your tongue is enough to drive a man to beat a woman ! " shouted Father . But he quickly got control of himself . " If I marry you to Terah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy man with a claim to an ancient priestly lineage . No one will say you married down . " " Yes they will , " she murmured . " Despite the fame of your beauty and the majesty of my rank , " said Faither dryly , " there has been no queue at our door of ruling princes begging for your royal company . " Qira burst into tears . " I will not live in a tent ! " " Is that all ? " said Father . " I 'll make that a condition of the weddingthat you never have to live in a tent . But this is the best marriage I will ever be able to arrange for you . " Qira was no fool . She might be bitterly disappointed , but she knew that Father would not lie about such a thing . " I will do my duty , " she said miserably . And so it was that she consented to this miserable wedding , wrecking all her hopes , discarding all her dreams . Ever since then , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much ? Still , for days at a time she had been able to forget what lay in her future . Desert men were unreliable . They changed their minds . They broke their word . Or perhaps her future husband died in battle and would never come for her . Or starved to death out in the deep desert where not even grass could grow . She had all sorts of hopeful fantasies like that . But now the filthy uncle was here , and Father insisted on parading her forth as if he were selling a milk cow . " Wear the scarlet , " Father said . Her most precious gown . Well , she would not wear it , not for the mere uncle . What did desert men know of scarlets and other bright and precious colors ? Everything was the yellow of grass and sand to them , everything smelled of the hair and dung of animals , and the only music that they knew was mooing and bleating . Scarlet would be wasted on him . If Father was unhappy that she disobeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick in front of the uncle ? Father could insist on the marriage , but she would show her independence where she could . Qira was not one for submissive obedience , and Father had better remember it . So it was her blue and brown woollen dress that she pulled on over her linen shift , only one step up from what a tradesman 's wife might wear . " Qira , what are you doing ? " Sarai stood in the door of her room , looking stricken . " Showing proper respect to my uncle-to-be , " said Qira , feigning innocence . " You must n't , " said Sarai . " He 's a desert manwhat will he know ? " " He will know , " said Sarai . " He 's not what you think . He does n't talk like an Amoritehis speech is as pure as ours , the speech of Ur the Great . And he 's a man of refined senses , I know ithe 'll understand what you mean by this coarse dress . " " It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Qira . " All my clothing is far above his station . " Why she was bothering to argue with a ten-year-old was beyond her , anyway . Sarai stood in the doorway , contemplating her . " Yes , after all , I think you 're right , " said Sarai . Since Sarai never changed her mind easily , Qira grew suspicious . " What do you mean ? " " It 's good to begin your marriage with honesty , not pretending , " said Sarai . " With this dress you 'll show him that you 're the daughter of a fallen , beggarly house that lives on the gifts of another king . The royal scarlet would be nothing but a sham . " " I hate you , " said Qira . " Asherah may never forgive Father for giving him such a nasty daughter . " " You do n't hate me , " said Sarai . " You love me because I remind you to do what you already know that you should . " " I do n't like doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sarai . " But we both do what we must . " Qira burst into tears and embraced her sister , who also wept . But as they clung to each other , Sarai spoke softly . " If your bridegroom is like his uncle , you 'll not be cursed by this marriage , you 'll be blessed . The uncle is a handsome man , and he speaks like one who is born to rule . " She told Qira all about Abram , saying several times that since this was only the uncle , the husband was bound to be even better . But Qira saw the truth behind the words , and she was astonished . " You 've fallen in love with the uncle ! " she said . Sarai looked startled , then embarrassed . " I like him , " said Sarai . " I know all about such ' liking , ' " said Qira . " You 're all set to keep him in your dreams , I know it from the way you talk ! " " The servant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You are n't bound over to Asherah 's service yet . " " I 'll help you put on the scarlet dress , " said Sarai . " You know I 'm right . That 's why you change the subject . " " I know that the uncle is waiting , and Father is impatient to show you off to him . " " Ten years old , but you have a woman 's heart . " " It would do me no good to love him , " said Sarai . " You know that if one who is intended for Asherah should turn away and marry a man , the goddess will never give her children as long as she lives . " " So I 've heard , " said Qira . " They say such things to keep temple-bound girls from wishing for a wedding . But who knows if it is true ? " " I do n't intend to find out , " said Sarai . " And yet you will dream . " Qira began to hum and sing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scarlet dress and turned and turned . Sarai could not help laughing . " You are such a foolish child , " she said . " The ten-year-old says this to her almost-married sister ? " " You 're a dreamer , " said Sarai . " So you think everyone dreams . " " You 're telling me you do n't ? I wo n't believe it . " " I 'm a very practical person , " said Sarai . " I keep my hands busy with work . I keep my thoughts on what my hands are doing . " " And you speak nonsense all day long . " " Come now , " said Sarai . " Father 's waiting . " " Down to earth , " said Qira . " Practical . Handy . What a sturdy wife you 'd make for a desert man . " " Do n't say any such thing in front of him , " said Sarai , suddenly angry . " Do n't you dare shame me like a little child who has no feelings ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teased . " And you just said that you had no feelings for this desert uncle . " The fury in Sarai 's face would have been frightening , if she were not so small . " If you mock me in front of him I will never forgive you ! " " I do what I want , " said Qira , and she flounced on out of the room , Sarai scampering furiously at her heels .
