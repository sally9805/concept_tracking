Chapter 1- Impedimenta // Joe Impedimenta . My classmates hung that nickname on me our first semester of high school when we were doing two periods of Latin a day . It was one of the first big words we learned . Impedimenta  --  the baggage that impedes one ? s progress . So I was Joe Impedimenta . Or Dash . A lot of people thought they called me Dash because of football . I was fast , and I scored my share of touchdowns . But the guys at an all-boys Catholic school usually didn ? t give you nicknames to make you feel better about yourself . They didn ? t call me Dash because of what I could do on the football field ; they called me Dash because of what I could not do in the classroom . I talked like Morse code . **35;550;TOOLONG . " You gu-gu-gu-gu-guys sh-sh-sh-sh-shut up ! " // My impedimenta was a stutter . It wasn ? t always bad . When I was at home with my brothers and sister , hanging out with my neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was fine , but when I got thrown into a new situation or a new school , had to read in front of the class , or wanted to ask out a girl , I just couldn ? t do it . My freshman year of high school , because of the stutter , I got an exemption from public speaking . Everybody else had to get up and make a presentation at the morning assembly , in front of 250 boys . I got a pass . And everybody knew it . Maybe they didn ? t think much of it  --  they had other things to worry about  --  but I did . It was like having to stand in the corner with the dunce cap . Other kids looked at me like I was stupid . They laughed . I wanted so badly to prove I was like everybody else . Even today I can remember the dread , the shame , the absolute rage , as vividly as the day it was happening . There were times I thought it was the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be my epitaph . And there were days I wondered : How would I ever beat it ? // It ? s a funny thing to say , but even if I could , I wouldn ? t wish away the darkest days of the stutter . That impedimenta ended up being a godsend for me . Carrying it strengthened me and , I hoped , made me a better person . And the very things it taught me turned out to be invaluable lessons for my life as well as my chosen career . // I started worrying about my stutter back in Scranton , Pennsylvania , in grade school . When I was in kindergarten , my parents sent me to a speech pathologist at Marywood College , but it didn ? t help much , so I went only a few times . Truth was , I didn ? t let the stutter get in the way of things that really mattered to me . I was young for my grade and always little for my age , but I made up for it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? d climb to the top of a burning culm dump , swing out over a construction site , race under a moving dump truck . If I could visualize myself doing it , I knew I could do it . It never crossed my mind that I couldn ? t . As much as I lacked confidence in my ability to communicate verbally , I always had confidence in my athletic ability . Sports was as natural to me as speaking was unnatural . And sports turned out to be my ticket to acceptance  --  and more . I wasn ? t easily intimidated in a game , so even when I stuttered , I was always the kid who said , " Give me the ball . " // Who ? s going to take the last shot ? " Give me the ball . " We need a touchdown now . " Give me the ball . " I ? d be eight years old , usually the smallest guy on the field , but I wanted the ball . And they gave it to me. // When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew so well to Wilmington , Delaware . My dad was having trouble finding a good job in Scranton , and his brother Frank kept telling him there were jobs in Wilmington . The Biden brothers had spent most of their school days in Wilmington , so it was like going home for my dad . For the rest of us , it felt like leaving home . But my mom , who was born and raised in Scranton , determined to see it as my dad did ; she refused to see it any other way . This was a wonderful opportunity . We ? d have a fresh start . We ? d make new friends . We were moving into a brand-new neighborhood , to a brand-new home . This wasn ? t a hand-me-down house . We ? d be the first people to ever set foot in it . It was all good . She was like that with my stutter , too . She wouldn ? t dwell on the bad stuff . Joey , you ? re so handsome . Joey , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ve got such a high IQ . You ? ve got so much to say , honey , that your brain gets ahead of you . And if the other kids made fun of me , well , that was their problem . They ? re just jealous . // She knew how wounding kids could be . One thing she determined to do when we moved to Wilmington was hold me back a year . Besides being young and small , I ? d missed a lot of school the last year in Scranton when I ? d had my tonsils and adenoids removed . So when we got to Wilmington , my mom insisted I do third grade over  --  and none of the kids at Holy Rosary had to know I was being held back by my mom . That was just another of the ways Wilmington would be a fresh start . // Actually , we were moving to the outskirts of Wilmington , to a working-class neighborhood called the Claymont area , just across the Pennsylvania state line . I still remember the drive into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad was at the wheel and my mom was up front with him , with the three of us kids in back : me , my brother , Jimmy , and my six-year-old sister , Valerie , who was also my best friend . We drove across the state line on the Philadelphia Turnpike , past the Worth Steel Mill , the General Chemical Company , and the oil refineries , all spewing smoke . We drove past Worthland and Overlook Colony , tightly packed with the row houses that the mills had built for their workers not long after the turn of the century . Worthland was full of Italians and Poles ; Overlook Colony was black . It was just a mile or so down the road to Brookview Apartments and our brand-new garden unit . A right off the Philadelphia Pike , and we were home . // Brookview was a moonscape . A huge water tower loomed over the development , but there wasn ? t a tree in sight . We followed the main road in as it swept us in a gentle curve . Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side was built , but the other was still under construction . We could see the heavy machinery idling among the mounds of dirt and red clay . It was a hot summer day , so our car windows were rolled down . I can still remember the smell of that red clay , the sulfurous stink from the bowels of the earth . As we arced down the main street toward a new home , my mom caught sight of these airless little one-story apartments . They were the color of brown mustard . My dad must have seen my mom ? s face as she scanned her new neighborhood . " Don ? t worry , Pudd ? , " he told her . " It ? s not these . We have a big one . " // He pulled the car around to the bottom of a bend , and without getting out of the car , he pointed across an expanse of not-quite lawn , toward the big one . Our new home was a two-story unit , white , with thin columns in front  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-story box off each side . " There it is , " he said . // " All of this ? " Mom asked . // " No , just the center , " my dad said . Then , " Don ? t worry , Pudd ? , it ? s only temporary . " // From the backseat I could tell my mom was crying . // " Mom ! ? What ? s the matter , Mommy ? " // " I ? m just so happy . Isn ? t it beautiful ? Isn ? t it beautiful ? " // Actually , it didn ? t seem bad to me . It was a miniature version of a center hall colonial , and we had bedrooms upstairs . I had the bedroom in back , which meant from my window I could gaze upon the object of my deepest desire , my Oz : Archmere . Right in the middle of this working-class steel town , not a mile from the mills and directly across from the entrance of Brookview Apartments , was the first mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for hours . John Jacob Raskob had built the house for his family before the steel mills , chemical plants , and oil refineries came to Claymont . Raskob was Pierre du Pont ? s personal secretary , but he had a genius for making money out of money . He convinced the du Ponts to take a big stake in General Motors and became its chairman of finance . Raskob was also a Catholic hero . He used part of his fortune to fund a charitable foundation , and he ? d run the campaign of the first Catholic presidential nominee , the Democrat Al Smith . In 1928 the Democrats had political strategy sessions in his library at Archmere . Raskob went on to build the Empire State Building . // The mansion he built in Claymont , the Patio at Archmere , was a magnificent Italianate marble pile on a property that sloped down to the Delaware River . Archmere  --  arch by the sea  --  was named for the arch of elms that ran on that slope to the river . But after the working man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution from the mills , began to crowd the Patio , Raskob cut his losses and sold the mansion to an order of Catholic priests . The Norbertines turned it into a private boys ? school . Archmere Academy was just twenty years old when I moved in across the street . // When I played CYO football that year , our coach was Dr. Anzelotti , a Ph.D . chemist at DuPont who had sons at the school . Archmere let Dr. Anzelotti run our practices on the grounds of the school . From the moment I got within the ten-foot-high wrought-iron fence that surrounded the campus and drove up the road  --  they actually called it the yellow-brick road  --  I knew where I wanted to go to high school . I didn ? t ever think of Archmere as a path to greater glory . When I was ten , getting to Archmere seemed enough . I ? d sit and stare out my bedroom window and dream of the day I would walk through the front doors and take my spot in that seat of learning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touchdown or hit the game-winning home run . // I entered third grade at Holy Rosary , a Catholic school half a mile down the Philadelphia Pike where the Sisters of Saint Joseph eased me into my new world . They were the link between Scranton and Claymont . Wherever there were nuns , there was home . I ? m as much a cultural Catholic as I am a theological Catholic . My idea of self , of family , of community , of the wider world comes straight from my religion . It ? s not so much the Bible , the beatitudes , the Ten Commandments , the sacraments , or the prayers I learned . It ? s the culture . The nuns are one of the reasons I ? m still a practicing Catholic . Last summer in Dubuque , Iowa , a local political ally , Teri Goodmann , took me to the Saint Francis Convent  --  a beautiful old building that looked like it belonged on an Ivy League campus . On the way over we ? d stopped by the Hy-Vee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finnegan Biden ? s son does not visit nuns empty-handed . It reminded me of grade school , of the last day before the holidays when all my classmates would be presenting their little Christmas offerings to the nun . The desk would be a mound of little specialty soaps . ( What else do you get a nun ? ) The sisters smelled like lavender the rest of the year . I don ? t remember a nun not smelling like lavender . // So I walked into the Dubuque convent with several gallons of ice cream and immediately began to worry we hadn ? t brought enough . Teri was expecting ten or twelve of the sisters to show up for the event , but there must have been four dozen nuns  --  many of them from the generation that taught me as a boy  --  sitting in a community room . I was there to give a talk about the situation in Iraq , and the sisters really wanted to understand the sectarian conflict there . They peppered me with questions about the Sunnis , the Shi ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the history of the religion the Kurds practice , and they wanted to know how I educated myself about the concerns of the Iraqi people . Many of these nuns had been teachers ; knowledge mattered most . We also talked about our own church , then about women ? s issues , education , and national security . Whether they agreed with my public positions or not , they all smiled at me . Even after we opened up the ice cream , they kept asking questions . And as I was getting ready to leave Teri asked if the sisters would , in the days ahead , pray for Joe Biden ? s success in his public journey . But they did more than that . The sisters formed a circle around me , raised their arms up over my head , and started singing the blessing they give to one of their own who is going off to do God ? s work in the next place . " May God bless you and keep you . " The sisters were so sweet and so genuine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid , like I was in touch with something bigger than me . It wasn ? t any epiphany , wasn ? t any altar call . It was where I ? ve always been . The Sisters of Saint Francis in Dubuque , Iowa , were taking me home . // The nuns were my first teachers . At Holy Rosary , like at Saint Paul ? s in Scranton , they taught reading and writing and math and geography and history , but embedded in the curriculum also were the concepts of decency , fair play , and virtue . They took as a starting point the biblical exhortation that man has no greater love than to lay down his life for another man ; in school we were about ten clicks back from that . You didn ? t give your life , but it was noble to help a lady across the street . It was noble to offer a hand up to somebody who had less . It was noble to step in when the bully was picking on somebody . It was noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
