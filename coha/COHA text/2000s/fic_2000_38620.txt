THE DAY I DIED WAS Thursday , December 10 , 1998 . It was overcast , drizzling , and cool here in Central Texas . Brodie Lane , an asphalt road between my rural home and the city of Austin , was shiny and slick . <p> A spot in the center of my chest and another on my lower right ribcage did n't feel right . The spot in my chest worried me , because I remembered reading about the wreck that had killed the comedian Sam Kinison . Kinison had walked away from his car , then sat down and died on the side of the road because his aorta had tom apart when his chest hit the steering column . <p> I did n't know whether my chest had hit my pickup 's steering column . I was still wearing my shoulder belt , so maybe I was just bruised where the belt had caught me . <p> If I had blacked out , it had n't lasted long . I could hear steam hissing from the radiator . The windshield had cracked , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumpled and popped up in front of it . I wanted to get out of there . <p> But first I had to get the zippered black nylon bag from behind the seat . I had to keep that with me , although I could n't remember why . <p> So I managed to unhook my seat belt , twist around , and grab the bag 's loop handles . A stab of pain shot through my ribs , but I held on to the bag . it was smaller than a briefcase and did n't seem to have much in it . <p> Then I realized that my glasses had flown off my face during the wreck , so I had to turn back around and paw at the floor with my free hand until I found them among the scattered pennies and Altoids . They were twisted , but the lenses were still in place . I bent them back enough so they stayed on my nose , and then I tried to open my door . <p> It was jammed shut , so I hauled myself across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door open about a foot and a half . That was far enough for me to squeeze through , wincing at my chest and ribs , clutching the black nylon bag . <p> Once outside in the drizzle , I smelled gasoline and coolant . My blue Dodge Dakota pickup truck was on the wrong side of a curve , its camper  --  shelled bed blocking part of the lane and its crumpled front end resting just off the edge of the pavement . <p> On the other side of the road , broadside across the northbound lane , was the silver Nissan pickup that had come around the curve too fast . I had been driving north on my way to buy Christmas presents in Austin , and this guy had come around the curve heading south . He 'd started fishtailing off the road , had overcorrected , and then slid across into my lane . I had tried to get around him , but his rear axle had swung into my grille like a battering ram . I had been going about 40 mph , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood there with my nylon bag in hand and my glasses askew , wondering whether my aorta was emptying into my chest , I looked over at the Nissan and saw that its cargo bed had caved in where it had hit my Dodge . But its cab had n't been touched , and the driver stood beside it looking sheepish . He was a young guy in a letter jacket . He tried to smile at me , but he knew he had screwed up . <p> " Are you okay ? " he asked . <p> I could hear the mingled hope and fear in his voice , but all I could do was tell him the truth . <p> " I do n't know , ' I I said . <p> Then I turned away and stumbled northward along the left edge of the road , staring west past the ditch and the barbed-wire fence at the scrubby field beyond . I saw something big and brown moving behind a clump of twisted cedar , so I clutched the nylon bag tighter and walked faster . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I did n't know where I was going , just as I did n't know why it had been important for me to take the nylon bag from the truck . My chest and ribs hurt with every step , but I was afraid of what might happen if I stopped . As long as I was in motion , I told myself , I was still alive . <p> A telephone-repair van approached from the north , slowed , and pulled over in front of me . So I had to stop after all . I asked the van 's driver to call the sheriff , and then I looked back south through drizzle-specked lenses . My Dodge 's rear hazard lights were flashing , but I did n't remember turning them on . I did remember , however , that I would need my driver 's license and insurance card when the law arrived . So I went back and rooted around on the floor of the cab again until I found my wallet . Then I paced back and forth in front of the truck 's crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel under the radiator . <p> A good oll boy in a crew-cab Ford drove up and offered to use his truck to push my wreck far enough off the road for traffic to pass . I took him up on it and tried to put the Dodge in neutral , but the transmission had locked up . The good ol ' boy did it anyway , though . I had to shout to stop him from pushing me all the way into the ditch , which was deep on that side of the road . <p> A few minutes later a Travis County sheriff 's deputy showed up , along with two tow trucks . The deputy asked me if I wanted an ambulance , but I did n't . I had decided by then that my aorta was still intact . My ribs hurt worse than my chest . <p> Then the telephone-van driver let me use his mobile phone to call my wife , Barb , at home . I told her I was only three miles from our house , and she said she 'd be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other guy 's Nissan to a nearby church parking lot , where the deputy took our statements and determined that the other guy was at fault . Barb showed up in her Saturn before the deputy had finished his paperwork - she had been heading for the curve , but spotted us in the church lot - so I got into the car with her to wait . I was glad to see her . <p> She pointed at the black nylon bag on my lap . <p> " What 's that ? " she asked . <p> I had been hoping she would know , because I still could n't remember . But I did n't want to open the bag to find out just yet , because it might contain a Christmas present that I 'd hidden in the Dodge so Barb would n't see it . <p> " A secret , " I said . <p> The deputy came over then , returned my license and insurance card , and told me where my wrecked truck would be towed . He also suggested I see a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thanked him , and then Barb drove us home . On the way , I put my insurance card back into my wallet and started to do the same with my license . But its photo made me stop . The photo was of me , all right - same dark-straw hair and beard , same farmboy face - but I was n't wearing my glasses . <p> " This is weird , " I said . " I only take off my glasses to sleep . " <p> Barb glanced at me . " They made you take them off for the picture when you went for your renewal . You thought it was weird then too . " <p> Now I was afraid that I had hit my head in the wreck and lost part of my memory . My head did n't hurt ... but I could n't remember what was in the nylon bag , or taking off my glasses for the driver 's license photo . <p> I started probing my scalp with my fingers as Barb pulled the Saturn into our garage , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What 's wrong ? " Barb asked . <p> I stopped probing my scalp , and then I replaced the unfamiliar license in my wallet . " Nothing , " I said . " Just checking for contusions . " <p> " We 're calling for that doctor 's appointment now , " Barb said . <p> So we went into the house , made the call , and arranged an appointment for the next morning . Then I went back to the small bedroom that serves as my office , ostensibly to hide the Christmas surprise that was inside the nylon bag . My fourteen-year-old black lab/Irish setter do &; Watson , was asleep on the office floor and did n't wake up when I came in . I closed the door and sat down at my desk , then cleared away a stack of papers and books to make room for the bag . <p> I sat there staring at it for a while . What if I opened it , discovered what was inside , and still did n't remember why it was important ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if I could n't remember the names of my friends or family ? What if I had forgotten how to touch  --  type or when to flush ? <p> I told myself I was being ridiculous , did n't believe it , and unzipped the bag anyway . <p> Then I looked inside , let out my breath , and grinned . Of course I knew what it was , and why I had taken it from the truck even before retrieving my wallet . <p> I also knew why Barb had n't recognized the bag . She had agreed that we needed to protect our pets and home , but she did n't approve of carrying weapons in our vehicles . So I had n't told her when I 'd stashed one in the Dodge and another in the Saturn . <p> I took the weapon from the bag to make sure it had n't been damaged in the accident . The thin metallic barrel still flared into a neat parabola at one end and tapered into a black plastic handgrip at the other with no dents or dings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicked from E to O to C and back again , and the arming switch in the handgrip still worked too . The red LED above the trigger came on , and the green LED beside it began glowing a few seconds later when the unit was charged . <p> My emu pistol was still in good shape , and that might mean . that my memory was too . I felt much better . <p> IT DID N'T LAST long . For one thing , my ribs gave me a pang as I set down the emu pistol and stood up from the desk . And then , as I went into the hallway , our gray cat Rufus came sauntering out from the master bedroom and rubbed against my ankle . <p> That might not sound like a problem , but it was . Rufus had been dead for two years . <p> Barb came running as I yelled , and Rufus looked up at me as if he thought I was brain damaged . And I was fairly certain I was . Rufus sure did n't look dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barb asked . <p> I pointed at Rufus . " He 's alive , " I said . <p> Barb looked at Rufus , then at me , then at Rufus . " When was n't he ? " <p> " Two years ago , " I said . " Two years ago , when he was ten , when he went outside and - " <p> I stopped myself . Somebody here was a few bubbles off true , and the circumstantial evidence was pointing toward me . So I did n't say what I knew had happened two years ago : Rufus had died when a lone emu had pushed open the gate in our chain-link fence , come into the back yard , and killed him . <p> " When what ? " Barb asked . <p> I shook my head . " Nothing . I 'm just rattled from the wreck . " <p> Barb squeezed my shoulder . " I do n't blame you . But Rufus is fine , and Watson and Clarence are fine too . " <p> " Does Watson still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office at the sleeping dog . <p> " Uh , yes , " Barb said . " And Rufus is still diabetic , and Clarence is still afraid of everything . He probably ran and hid when you yelled . " <p> So Rufus was alive , but diabetic . It was news to me . I squatted and petted him , thinking that I might discover he was a different cat from the Rufus I remembered . But he had the same scruffy gray fur , the same bad fish-breath , and the same attitude of fearless entitlement . <p> That was what had gotten him killed in the first place . Our other cat , Clarence , had been in our half-acre back yard that evening too , but he had run for the house in a black-and-white blur when the emu had arrived . Rufus , however , had stood his ground . He had probably thought that the five-to-six-foot-tall bird was a giant chicken that the God of Cats had sent him for supper . <p> I had looked out the window when Clarence burst in through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the waning light , and had then grabbed the home-protection emu pistol from the hall closet and run outside . But I had been too late . The bird had gutted Rufus with its talons , stomped on him , and vanished back through the open gate - the gate I had stupidly forgotten to latch that afternoon - before I could get close enough to scramble its tiny , murderous brain . <p> Now , though , the cat that I had buried by the live oak tree at the end of the yard was purring as I petted him and batting at my hand when I tried to stop . But I had to stop anyway , because squatting was n't doing my ribs any good . I thought about going down to the tree to see whether the grave was still there , but decided that was a bad idea . <p> " How about lunch ? " Barb asked . <p> " Sure , " I said . " I 'll make it . " <p> I was n't hungry . But I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good way to avoid it . I burned three grilled-cheese sandwiches before giving up and starting a salad . <p> Then , while looking for croutons , I came across a bag of syringes . <p> " Honey ! " I yelled . " Are you on junk ? " <p> " Excuse me ? " Barb called from the living room . <p> Then I saw that the label on the bag said , " For Rufus ( cat ) - 4 units/ Once daily . " <p> Of course . If Rufus was diabetic , he needed insulin . <p> " I mean , have you given Rufus his shot today ? " I yelled . <p> " No . You said you 'd do it as usual when you got back from Christmas shopping . " <p> So giving Rufus his insulin was my job , but I had no memory of ever doing it . Still , how hard could it be ? <p> I found a vial of insulin in the refrigerator , figured out how to fill the syringe to four units , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I managed . And I would do the same thing , I told myself , with any other mental gaps that presented themselves . I would spackle the holes in my memory one by one until they were invisible again . <p> After lunch , I took the garbage to the compost heap and found that being outside made me paranoid . Even though no emus had come near our yard since the one that had killed Rufus an event which apparently had n't happened in the first place ) , I was convinced that I could hear a whole flock of them pushing through the trees and brush behind our fence . <p> So after dumping the garbage , I went back to the house and closed the pet door after checking to see that Watson and the cats were inside . Then I went to the hall closet . My plan was to arm myself , then go out behind the fence and either brain-scramble or scare off the birds that I knew were back there . <p> But the emu pistol that we kept in the closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook that the holster had hung from was missing . <p> My paranoia worsened . With the sore spot in my chest aching and my ribs feeling as if they were wrapped around a steak knife , I went into the garage and reached under the Saturn 's passenger seat . All I found were a wadded Kleenex and an empty Butterfinger wrapper . <p> I rushed back into the house and almost shouted to Barb that two of our emu pistols were missing , but stopped myself . She was reading a book , and there was no point in alarming her - especially since she had n't even known about the pistol I 'd hidden in the Saturn . <p> Barb had never believed that the emu threat in our area was serious , since most of the flock sightings and the worst of the attacks had taken place far out in the Hill Country . And since I had caught only an uncertain glimpse of the emu that had killed Rufus , she had always suspected a bobcat or raccoon . <p> But I had known better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one provided by the state so we 'd have protection away from home . We lived close to Austin , but not so close that lone emus or ostriches separated from their Hill Country flocks could n't cause trouble for someone changing a flat tire . <p> Now two of our three pistols were gone . But since I remembered buying the extras because of Rufus 's death , and now Rufus was n't dead , maybe we 'd never had more than one in the first place . <p> I went into my office and found that the pistol I 'd taken from the Dodge was still on my desk , charged and ready to go because I 'd left the arming switch on . <p> So I took it outside and tramped around behind our fence until I was satisfied there were no emus lurking about . Then I returned to the house and opened the pet door so Watson , Rufus , and Clarence could have access to the back yard again . <p> Clearly , both my paranoia and my memory problems had been caused by stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rufus 's death had occurred in a hallucination I 'd had during a blackout after the impact with the Nissan . The memory seemed much more real than that , but perhaps that was only an indication of how hard the two trucks had collided . <p> As I finished taking the plastic slide out of the pet door to open it , I heard Barb 's voice behind me . <p> " What the heck is that thing ? " she asked . <p> I turned and saw that she was pointing at the emu pistol , which I had laid on the floor while opening the pet door . <p> I could tell from Barb 's tone of voice that she was n't kidding . She really did n't know what it was . <p> Great <p> I could have told her the truth , but there was no point in that . If the truth could have made sense to her , she would have known it inthe first place . <p> " It 's a toy , " I said . " I found it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown it over the fence . " <p> " Oh , " Barb said . Then she looked at me with concern . " You probably do n't feel like working . Want to watch a video ? " <p> " You bet . Pick one out , and I 'll be right there . " <p> Barb went to select a movie , and I switched off the emu pistol and put it back into its nylon bag in my office . Then I joined Barb in the living room , and we watched a Bill Murray film , Groundhog Day . <p> I tried to take comfort from the fact that I recognized the plot , but I did n't succeed . In the Groundhog Day that I remembered , Bill Murray had been bald . In this one he had hair , but it looked as if it had been applied with a glue gun . <p> That night I tried to stay awake because I was afraid to fall asleep . I was afraid that I was still in my truck at the moment of impact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my whole waking life since the wreck that had been a hallucination . If I fell asleep , the hallucination would be over . And so would my life . <p> But despite my best efforts and the pain in my side , I finally did sleep . I dreamed of trying to run away down Brodie Lane while being pursued by a thundering flock of ostriches - which , as most people know , can be even more dangerous than emus . <p> I woke up on Friday morning ; so I was either still alive or still hallucinating during the split second before my death . But I did n't have time to try to figure out which , because Barb rousted me from bed to drive me to the doctor 's office in Austin . It was another gray , drizzly day , and I clenched the armrest all the way to town . <p> Barb went into the examination room with me . She wanted to stay close both to keep me calm and to find out whether I was seriously damaged . <p> I was curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square to the world . My toothpaste had tasted odd that morning , like peppermint instead of cashews , and it had freaked me out a little . <p> The doctor asked a lot of questions , squeezed my ribs ( which hurt ) , thumped my chest ( which was feeling better ) , and then sent me down a hallway for an X-ray . Barb came along , and we waited outside the X-ray room until a technician appeared and called my name . <p> I went in , and Barb stayed outside as the technician closed the door . <p> Inside the small room was a white table , and suspended over it was a gigantic machine that could have been a prop in a 1935 Universal horror movie . <p> " What the heck is that thing ? ' I I asked . <p> The technician gave me a quizzical look . " It 's the X-ray machine . " <p> I stared at it . " I 've had X-rays before , " I said , " and the machines were n't anything like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture James Bond . " <p> The technician chuckled . " Just take off your shirt and lie face down on the table . " <p> " I 'm not kidding , " I said . " The last X-ray I had was about eight years ago , and the machine was the size of a Polaroid camera . " <p> The technician raised an eyebrow . " I think that probably was a Polaroid camera . Take off your shirt and lie face down , please . " <p> I did as I was told . It was painful to lie on my belly , and I gritted my teeth as the technician fiddled with knobs and switches on the contraption above me . Then he inserted a piece of film the size of a cookie sheet into a slot in the table . <p> " It was n't a Polaroid , " I said , wincing . " The radiologist had me stand against the wall , and then she picked up the unit and pushed a button . The film came rolling out from the bottom . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , " the technician said . " Do n't move . " <p> Then he took a heavy apron from a peg on the wall , put it on , and stepped behind a metal partition . He peered at me through a window that looked as if it belonged on a space capsule . <p> " Take a deep breath and hold it , " he said . <p> I had a bad feeling about all of this . " Why are you standing way back there ? " I asked . <p> " Because I do this thirty times a day , " he said , as if speaking to a threeyear-old . " The lead apron and the barrier protect me from too much radiation . " <p> His explanation only made my bad feeling worse . " Hey , I 'm lying here without even a shirt . What 's protecting me ? " <p> " Take a deep breath and hold it . " <p> I was beginning to freak out a little more than I had from the peppermint toothpaste . <p> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . <p> " No , Mr. Denton , " the technician said . He sounded annoyed . " I expect you to take a deep breath and hold it . " <p> I took a deep breath and held it , convinced that the next thing I felt would be a laser beam slicing through my spine . But there was only a click and a buzz , and then the technician came out from behind the partition . He pulled the sheet of film from the table and inserted another . <p> " One more , " he said . Then he looked down at me with a smirk . " Think you can stand it ? " <p> He sounded mighty condescending , I thought , for a guy wearing a lead apron . <p> Twenty minutes later , back in the examination room , the doctor told me and Barb that the X-ray had revealed three cracked ribs . She wrote a prescription for painkillers , then gave me a velcro-fastened elastic-bandage " rib belt " and told me to come back for more X-rays in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> WE STOPPED at our usual supermarket on the way home , and I headed for the pharmacy window while Barb grabbed a cart and went to pick up a few other items . The rib belt was tight and uncomfortable , and I wanted to loosen it . But that would have involved unbuttoning my shirt and ripping open the velcro while on line behind an elderly lady who was there to pick up her blood-pressure medicine . It did n't seem like a wise move . <p> After getting my prescription , I met Barb at a checkout lane and helped her unload the cart . It was at this point that I once again began to freak out a little . <p> The kid manning the register took the first item , a can of soup , and waved it over an asterisk-shaped plate of glass set into the counter . Something made a beeping sound , and then the kid rolled the can down the counter to another kid who looked at me and asked , " Paper or plastic ? " <p> My rib belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh , neither , " I said . " It 's soup . " <p> Both kids looked at me dully . <p> " Plastic will be fine , " Barb said , giving me a don't-be-a-smartass look . <p> But I was n't being a smartass . I was baffled . I could see now that the glass plate had a red light burning beneath it , and the beeping sound happened every time the cashier waved something over it . And the kid at the end of the counter was putting our groceries into flimsy plastic bags instead of sturdy foldout boxes . Everything except the canned goods would be mashed flat before we got home . <p> All of this oddness , plus my lingering unease over the giant X-ray machine , made me dizzy . I wanted to close my eyes , but I was afraid that if I did , I would reopen them to discover that I was lying on the wet asphalt of Brodie Lane with mist falling into my face and my brains dribbling into the ditch . <p> And maybe that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to belong where I was . <p> So I went ahead and closed my eyes , but when I opened them I was still at the checkout counter with Barb , and she was paying for our groceries by passing a credit card through a slot . That , at least , was familiar . But that was how the groceries should have been tallied , too - by swiping price tags through a slot , not by waving things over a glass plate . <p> The only thing that made me hope I still might be mostly sane was that Barb seemed to be the same person she had been before the wreck . She was five-foot-two with curly brown hair , green-flecked eyes , and a lot of patience . <p> On the other hand , she did n't know what an emu pistol was , and the bizarre supermarket-checkout routine did n't faze her . I wished I 'd dragged her into the X-ray room so I could have seen her reaction there . <p> I did n't say any of this to her , though . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to straighten itself out . The tow yard where my Dodge now sat was on our way home , and we were planning to stop there to retrieve a few things that I had n't thought to take with me after the accident . Seeing the crumpled truck , I hoped , might jolt my head back into place . <p> But when I slogged through the muck in the tow yard toward the Dodge , all I could think was that it was impossible for me to be alive . The front end of the truck was even more crushed than I had realized the day before . The hood had folded , the right front tire had exploded , the grille had disintegrated , the radiator had burst , and the frame had bent like al dente spaghetti . The right front fender looked like an aluminum can that had been run over by a lawn mower . The engine had compacted up against the fire wall , and the fire wall had bowed inward . The Dodge was totaled and then some . <p> As I stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the truck with a disposable camera she 'd bought at the supermarket . We had decided to photograph the damage in case there were insurance problems , but now I also thought I 'd want the pictures just so I could see myself standing beside what should have been my coffin . just so I 'd have visual proof that I walked away from it . <p> And right on the heels of that thought , I recalled that a photograph was n't proof of anything . You could alter a photograph to make it look as if Abraham Lincoln walked away from a wrecked Dodge . <p> Or was that only true in the world I remembered ? Was it also true in a world where groceries were packed into plastic bags , X-ray machines were the size of bass boats , toothpaste tasted like peppermint , and Bill Murray had hair ? <p> Barb drove us home from the tow yard via Brodie Lane , and once again I glimpsed something big and brown off among the cedars . So I leaned down to grab the emu pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain cut through my ribs that there was n't one there anymore . <p> And whatever I had glimpsed was gone when I looked again . <p> That night , after Barb fell asleep , I left our bed and went across the hall into my office . My ribs were hurting like mad despite my pain pills , but I would n't have been able to sleep anyway . Too much in the past day and a half had just been wrong . <p> I closed the door , turned on my computer , and booted up my Internet software . Then the modem dialed and logged on as it was supposed to , and I relaxed a little . I had been afraid that this new world might not have the same Web that I knew , but so far it looked familiar . Even my incoming email list was loaded with the usual get-rich-quick junk and porn-site solicitations . And I still did n't know how my name had gotten onto the porn-solicitation list . Honest . <p> After deleting the junk and reading the few pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank goodness - I jumped to a searchengine site and typed in " dangerous , " " Texas , " and " emus . " <p> Then , as I waited for the list of hits to pop up , I took my emu pistol from its bag and pointed it at the screen as if expecting one of the feathered monsters to leap out at me . I almost hoped one would , because at least then I 'd know for sure that I was hallucinating . And I would have the right weapon at hand to dispatch the hallucination . <p> To my initial relief , there were some promising news-article hits . But when I jumped to the sites and began to read , a chill spread up from my sore ribs into my chest . <p> According to the online articles , a few out-of-business Texas emu and ostrich ranchers had simply released their birds rather than destroy or sell them . And these birds were indeed a potential problem to farmers , motorists , and others . <p> However , what I read made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important one in the state , that the numbers of free  --  roaming birds were few , and that dangerous encounters were rare . The birds were big and skittish , but they were n't murderous . <p> This was not as it was in the world , in the Texas , that I remembered . <p> In that world , the Texas ratite industry enjoyed a boom in the late 1980s akin to the booms enjoyed by the Texas petroleum industry in times past . Emus became lucrative because of demand for their low-cholesterol meat and the skin-care products made from their body oils , and ostrich feathers and eggs followed suit . So emu and ostrich ranches sprang up throughout the state , with a heavy concentration in the Central Texas Hill Country . <p> Then , in 1991 , the Texas beef industry fought back with a television ad. in the ad , a prissy Yankee orders a chopped-emu sandwich at the counter of a barbecue joint . As he does so , a group of Texans surrounds him , and a rawboned hombre drawls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then the hombre buys the Yankee a slab of beef ribs - and at his first bite , the prissy guy morphs into John Wayne in a ten-gallon hat . <p> " Now , that 's good eatin ' , pilgrim ! " he says . <p> At that , everyone draws six-shooters , yells " Yee-hah , " and blasts holes in the ceiling . <p> That ad - plus the persistent rumor that emus were carriers for various avian flu strains - put an end to the emu and ostrich boom . Most of the ranchers went bankrupt , and they set thousands of birds free . <p> The freed birds went feral and got mean . Something about roaming wild , or about the diet available to them in the Hill Country , turned them into vicious marauders . By 1993 , flocks of emus and ostriches ranging from a half dozen to several hundred birds were roaming through the hills destroying property and occasionally slicing or trampling people and livestock to death . Still more deaths resulted as many of the bullets and shotgun blasts intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being attacked . To make matters worse , shots to the emus ' double  --  feathered bodies tended not to kill them right away , but made them stomp and kick even harder . <p> Thus , to their shock , Texans discovered that firearms were an ineffective defense against emus . Or , to be accurate , we rediscovered that fact ... because the Australians learned the same lesson in 1932 , when troops armed with machine guns and artillery attempted to destroy a flock of twenty thousand emus that was devouring Western Australian crops . The campaign failed , however , when the besieged emus split their army into squads and adopted guerrilla tactics . in the end , the 1932 Emu War resulted in exactly twelve enemy casualties - and in the decision to build a six-hundred-mile-long fence between wilderness and farmland . <p> That solution was n't practical for the Lone Star State , but the members of the Texas Legislature realized they had to do something . So scientists at Texas A &M; University were commissioned to 1 ) find a way to wipe out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2 ) find a way for people to defend their families in the meantime without wasting ammunition and/or killing each other . <p> There 's nothing the Aggies like better than a challenge that involves both livestock and weaponry , so by the fall of 1994 they had solved both problems . <p> The first problem would be handled by air-dropping contraceptive food pellets over the thousands of acres of tree-covered hills where the birds roamed and hid . Then , over the course of a decade or so , the flocks would dwindle and disappear . <p> The second problem would be dealt with by state-subsidized emu pistols . These were ultrasonic-pulse devices designed to daze the birds long enough for endangered humans to either get to safety or use a firearm at point-blank range . A sustained ultrasonic blast aimed at an individual bird 's head could possibly kill it , but the Aggies envisioned that most situations would call for blasts fired in a wide pattern so as to incapacitate an entire flock for a short period of time . <p> The Legislature decided that one emu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with confirmed feral emu sightings , and that extra weapons would be available at nominal fees . City dwellers , however , would have to pay full retail . Or they could rent a pistol if they just wanted to go camping for the weekend . <p> Unfortunately , the emu pistols ' manufacture and release to the public were delayed by legislative wrangling . The weapons had initially been designed for use against emus only , but then a representative from Dripping Springs rose to point out that ostriches , while fewer in number , had also caused plenty of trouble . Specifically , they had smashed his carport . So the Legislature asked the Aggies if the pistols would work on ostriches , and the Aggies replied that while the frequency required to stun an ostrich differed from that required to stun an emu , the pistols could be built with both . <p> Then a state senator from Nacogdoches described how he had been trampled and spat upon by camels during a vacation trip to Big Bend . Camels , he insisted , were far more hostile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called emu pistols did not include a setting for camels , he would block the appropriation for their manufacture . <p> Legislators from the Big Bend region were furious , and they insisted that the few camels wandering their districts were relatively tame . But the senator held his ground , and the Aggies finally agreed to include a camel setting on the pistols ... even though it was soon well known that the setting was virtually useless , and that the only way to stun a camel with an emu pistol was to use it as a shiny object to induce hypnosis . <p> So it was that my own emu pistol had a three-position selector switch , and I clicked it back and forth as I searched the Web and found no mention of any such pistols or switches . I did find an article about the senator from Nacogdoches , though , in which he still claimed that he had been trampled and spat upon while visiting Big Bend . In this version , however , he blamed a combined group of gay-rights and Earth First activists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I logged off , then shut down the computer and sat in my office staring at the emu pistol . <p> Even if I had imagined the other discrepancies , the pistol was tangible evidence that either I or the world had been transformed in the moment that my Dodge had crumpled into a useless hulk . <p> It was tangible evidence , in fact , that I and this new reality might not even belong in the same plane of existence . <p> BUT ON SATURDAY morning Barb drove us to Katz 's Deli on 6th Street in Austin - and when we arrived , everything there felt normal and right . We had been going to what I called " Herd Breakfast " on Saturday mornings with our friends Caroline , Warren , Bud , and Sven for almost ten years , and today they all seemed to be just as I remembered them from before the accident . <p> The breakfast conversation began with words of sympathy about my wreck , after which the Herd shifted gears as a group and gave me grief about whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital . This sort of shift was typical and therefore reassuring . <p> Then the trouble started again . <p> " Speaking of underwear , " Caroline said , her eyes lighting up the way they do when she 's about to plunge into a real briar patch of a topic , " what kind of person would think that exposing her thong to the President of the United States was an appropriate thing to do ? " <p> " What kind of President would agree ? " Bud asked , grinning through the steam from his coffee cup . <p> Warren groaned . " Who really cares ? " <p> " The congressmen pursuing impeachment , " Barb said . <p> " They 're just jealous because someone is having sex and it is n't them , " Sven said . He took a sip of his Diet Coke . " I 'm a little miffed about that myself , actually . " <p> I was both appalled and confused . " What on earth are y'all talking about ? Was there something about this in the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I mean , it 's ludicrous , " I said . " President Ferraro would never put up with stuff like that . " <p> Everyone laughed , but I did n't know why . <p> On the way home , Barb stopped at the supermarket to drop off the disposable camera , with its photos of the mangled Dodge , for developing . I waited in the car while she went inside because I was afraid of seeing anything else that I knew had n't been in the world before Thursday . <p> I turned on the car radio and flipped around the dial , and pretty soon that seemed to be a bad idea too . I had n't heard of half the bands or songs . But then I realized that had been true before the wreck , too . Pop-music ignorance was just a function of being forty . <p> I could n't blame everything else on that , though . So far , this new reality did n't seem to have changed anyone I knew - but I could n't help fearing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been swapped for the man Barb and our friends remembered . And I could n't help wondering how they would react when they found out . <p> When Barb returned to the car , she gave me a package of " Nutter Butter " cookies that she seemed to think were my favorites . So I ate one , and it was pretty dam tasty . <p> But I had never eaten one before . I had never even heard of them . <p> I did n't tell Barb , though . <p> For now , I still wanted her to think that her husband had survived . <p> I spent most of Saturday afternoon and evening watching familiar old movies like Casablanca , Body Heat , and Blazing Saddles , and I found no more discrepancies like the hair problem in Groundhog Day . Even so , I did n't want to go down the hall to my office to try to work . I was afraid that whatever story-in-progress I pulled up on my computer screen would be something I had never even started writing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was being silly . Each of the things that had seemed unfamiliar or weird since the accident - the Nutter Butters , the Presidential scandal , the X-ray machine , etc. - had been a thing outside myself . So there was no reason to think that any of my work was anything other than what I remembered it to be . <p> But on Sunday moming , I opened the closet in my office to get a fresh ream of paper and happened to glance up at the shelf that holds copies of my published books . <p> I did n't recognize one of them . <p> My hands were shaking as I pulled that book down to look at it . Its title and dust jacket were utterly unfamiliar . So was its title page . <p> Its contents page , though , was another matter . The book was a story collection , and I recognized all of the titles except the last one . in fact , other than that title , I recognized the page itself . It was from my collection Bloody Bunnies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd written especially for the book . A story that was n't there anymore . <p> In its place was a story I 'd never heard of , and the book itself was stamped with the ludicrous title One Day Closer to Death . <p> That was it . I 'd had enough . <p> " Who wants to read a book called One Day Closer to Death ? " I yelled . " And who cares if this Blackburn guy bakes cookies or not ? " <p> I went on in this vein for a while . When I finally looked up , Barb was standing in my office doorway with an expression on her face that went beyond concern . It went all the way to contemplation of signing me up for electroshock therapy . <p> " What would a better title have been ? " she asked . <p> " The same one I already used ! Bloody Bunnies ! " Barb frowned . " That does n't sound too good . " <p> I was stunned . " Bloody Bunnies " was the best story I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sure of it . <p> Then I realized that I could n't remember a single thing about it except its title . <p> And that was the final proof . <p> This world was not my world . The people closest to me might seem the same , but too much else was different . <p> Either I was dead and this was the Afterlife , or I was alive and stuck in an alien reality . Either way , I was no longer where I belonged . <p> That left me with only two options . <p> One was to try to adapt to my new surroundings . But in a world where even my books and stories were different , in a world with no Bloody Bunnies , I was n't sure that I 'd have much luck . <p> So I decided to try my other option first . <p> I would try to find a way back home . <p> I slept through Sunday night because I was too exhausted to stay awake . The only dream I had involved an emu , an ostrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to draw and quarter me . Then they gave up , and the rabbit just smothered me . <p> When I awoke Monday morning , Rufus was curled up on the bed two inches from my face . I yelped , and he opened his eyes halfway and yawned before going back to sleep . <p> Barb , still in her nightgown , came into the bedroom from the bathroom . " Something wrong ? " she asked . <p> " Just a bad dream , " I said . " Asphyxiation by giant bunny . " I began to sit up , and pain shot through my right side . I had slept without taking the useless pain pills or wearing the rib belt , but I would have to try the belt again . <p> Barb was shaking her head . " I do n't think you 're in shape to drive . But I ca n't reschedule my interview , so we 'll have to reschedule with the veterinarian instead . " <p> " Huh ? " I asked . <p> " I have a job interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember ? " <p> And now I did , sort of . At least , I knew that Barb was on a job hunt in this world too , it seemed . " Yes . Sorry . I 'm still half asleep . " I hoped that would be a sufficient excuse . " And what 's this about the vet ? " <p> " Last Wednesday you made a 9:30 appointment for Rufus to have his blood sugar checked today . " <p> Well , how could I have known that ? In the place I had been last Wednesday , Rufus had been dead for two years . <p> " But since we only have one vehicle now , " Barb continued , " we 'll have to reschedule . Otherwise you 'd have to drive me to the interview , zoom back south to take Rufus to the vet , and then pick me up . I doubt that your ribs are up to it . " <p> My ribs hurt , allright , but Barb had given mean idea . Our veterinarian 's office was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really wanted to get back to the world I remembered , I would have to begin at the spot where things had changed . And I would have to go there without Barb . <p> I got up from the bed , doing my best not to grimace . " I 'm feeling better , " I said . " I can drive . " <p> Barb was dubious . " I 'm not sure that 's a good idea . I almost lost you last Thursday , and I do n't want anything like that to happen again . " <p> I forced a smile . " What are the odds ? " <p> After showering and dressing , and while Barb was putting on her interview clothes , I took the black nylon bag with the emu pistol to the garage and slid it under the driver 's seat in the Saturn . It was the only thing that I knew for sure came from my rightful world , and I wanted it with me when I revisited the scene of my reality shift . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I wanted to be ready if I gained any sudden insight . I was even wearing the same clothes that I had worn at the time of the wreck - blue jeans , black T-shirt , leather jacket . The only difference was that I was wearing the rib belt , too . <p> After stashing the emu pistol , I undertook the adventure of putting Rufus into his carrier . The carrier was nothing more than a cat-sized plastic box with air holes , a wire door , and a handle - but Rufus seemed to think it was a meat grinder . Each time I got any two of his feet inside , the other two would grab the outer edges and hang on . I tried putting him in frontward , backward , and sideways , but nothing worked . I got a few scratches out of the deal , though . <p> Finally , Barb came out of the bedroom wearing a crisp navy business suit , scooped up Rufus , and tucked him into the carrier without getting so much as a wisp of fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any trouble with this , " she said as she closed and latched the wire door . " Are you sure you want to drive ! " <p> I was breathing hard and my ribs ached , but I said I was fine . <p> Then I drove Barb to downtown Austin through the city 's abominable rush hour traffic , made worse by the fact that this was yet another damp , gray day . But despite the wet asphalt and the countless drivers who did n't understand the concept of hydroplaning , I delivered Barb to the right address by 8:45 with no difficulties other than constant pain . The rib belt did n't seem to be helping . <p> As Barb opened her door , she pointed at a coffee shop across the street . " Can you meet me there in two hours ? " <p> " Sure , " I said , and wondered whether it was true . If I somehow managed to slip back through the truck-wreck reality rip into the world I came from , would Barb still be downtown for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this reality be able to slip back through as well ... or had he died in the accident ? <p> " Are you going to be okay ? " Barb asked . <p> At that point , Rufus let out a pitiful yowl from the carrier in the back seat . <p> " I 'd better be , " I said . " I do n't think Rufe would put up with waiting here . " <p> That answer seemed to make Barb feel better . She kissed me and I wished her luck , and then she headed into the building for her interview . <p> I turned the car around and drove south while fighting off my sense of guilt by telling myself that I was trying to do the right thing . Even if finding my way back home meant leaving this world 's Barb a widow , I argued , would n't that be better than leaving her with a false husband from another dimension ? <p> The veterinarian 's office was as I remembered it , and so was everyone there . They were gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more quickly than I had hoped . It turned out that he needed a slight boost in his insulin dosage , but was doing well otherwise . He had even gained a few ounces since his last visit , they said . He was up to eleven pounds . That was still down from the thirteen of his glory days , but not bad for a twelve-year-old cat with diabetes . <p> I was able to get him back into the carrier without help . Then I paid the bill , thanked the doctor and his staff , and took Rufus out to the Saturn . Once inside the car , I found a notepad and pen in the glove compartment and wrote out the new insulin instructions . I tore off the page and folded it , wrote Barb 's name on the outside , and tucked it into one of the carrier 's air holes . just in case . <p> Then , with Rufus strangely quiet , I drove to the curve on Brodie Lane where I had died . <p> I approached from the north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then pulled off onto the narrow strip of gravel between the asphalt and the ditch . I did n't see any ripple in the air or feel my hair stand on end , but my pulse quickened anyway . <p> This was where it had happened . This was where my mangled Dodge had stopped , and where I had stumbled into the drizzle clutching a black nylon bag from another world . <p> There was no traffic from either direction , but to be safe I scooted over the brake lever and got out of the car on the passenger side . My first step made a crunching sound that was n't gravel , so I looked down and saw shards of blue , black , and amber plastic . They were the remains of the Dodge 's grille and turn signals . <p> I stood there gripping the rubbery top edge of the open Saturn door , staring down at the Dodge fragments , and wondered what I had been expecting to find . There was no doorway back to the world I remembered , There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic . <p> Then a gray streak shot past my legs and leaped into the ditch . <p> It was Rufus . Apparently , I had failed to latch the wire door on the carrier . So now he was out of the car and down in the ditch , chasing something I could n't even see . A field mouse , maybe . Or maybe nothing at all . <p> I jumped down after him , and when I landed it was as if I had been run through with a javelin . My ribs blazed , and I dropped to my knees . The air turned a misty red for a few seconds - and even when I could see clearly again , my head and ribs continued to throb with each beat of my heart . <p> Rufus had stopped about thirty feet to the north and was looking back at me with an annoyed expression , as if I had scared off his mouse . <p> Then I heard a loud hiss above me , and I looked up and saw the emu on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet tall , eight feet long . <p> And this section of fence was missing three strands of barbed wire , leaving it about two feet high . <p> The emu cocked its head and bent its long , feathered neck to look down at me . Then it hissed again and stamped its foot , giving me a good view of its talons . They looked sharp . And there were three more just like them on the other foot . <p> I tried to yell and wave my arms to spook it . But all I could manage was a wheeze , and waving my arms only twisted the javelin in my ribs . It hurt so much I almost cried . <p> The emu 's throat swelled , its beak opened wide , and it let out a roar like cannon fire . <p> Then it hopped over the fence into the ditch . Its feet hit the wet ground with a loud thud . <p> " Shoo , " I rasped . <p> The emu took a step , and now it was within kicking distance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . <p> I could see in its evil little eyes that it was an emu from my world . And an emu from my world would just as soon gut you as look at you . It had come through the reality rip with me on Thursday , and it had been hanging around Brodie Lane for four days , waiting for someone to maim . <p> And unless I could move fast , that someone would be me . <p> But I could n't move fast . I was n't sure I could move at all . <p> Then the gray streak shot past me again , and the startled emu leaped back up toward the fence . <p> Rufus , in this world as in mine , did n't care that the emu was enormous and deadly . All he saw was a big bird . All he saw was something to chase . <p> Or maybe he was trying to protect me . Because even when the emu stopped with its back to the fence and began kicking and stomping , Rufus kept after it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his pitiful little paws , dodging this way and that - when he could have , should have , turned and run . <p> Whatever his motivation , the result was that he distracted the emu long enough for me to lurch to my feet and stagger up to the Saturn . I fell into the car , howled as the javelin spiked me again , and clawed under the driver 's seat for the black nylon bag . <p> I was mostly insane at that point , but I had one clear thought screaming at me over and over : <p> Not this time ! NOT THIS TIME ! <p> I could n't get that out of my head ... even though I knew that if I did nothing , I would be on my way back home . Because as Rufus had run toward the emu , I had realized what it would take to reopen the rip between worlds . I was as sure of it as I was of the pain in my side . <p> If the emu killed Rufus , then that one event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then everything else would topple back to the way it all was before , one domino after another , as quick and inevitable as a truck wreck . <p> That was why I had come back to the curve on Brodie Lane . That was what I had wanted ever since the accident . <p> But in the moment that Rufus 's stupid little cat brain had once again decided that it was a good idea to stand up to a six-foot-tall psychopathic monster , I had reconsidered . <p> Maybe I did n't belong in this reality . Maybe this was n't my world . <p> But God damn it , my cat was still my cat . And I would n't let him die because of my mistake again . <p> I tore the emu pistol from the bag and made sure the selector was set to E. Then I flipped the arming switch , threw myself backward out of the Saturn , and fell down the muddy slope to the bottom of the ditch again . I landed on my back and looked up through another red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emu . <p> The emu was still kicking and Rufus was still swiping and dodging . But Rufus had slowed , and as I raised the pistol in both hands , the emu 's right foot came down and caught him . <p> Rufus shrieked as only a cat can shriek . <p> The red and green LEDs were glowing , so I drew a bead on the emu 's head and pulled the trigger . The handgrip went from cold to hot in a quarter second , and the pistol shuddered and hummed . <p> The emu 's head snapped back as if smacked by a shovel , and then the monster just stood there swaying and blinking . <p> I kept the trigger depressed and my aim on the emu 's head as I rolled onto my left side , got to my knees , and finally stood . Then I clambered up toward the fence yelling " Die , die , die ! " or something similar until the business end of the pistol was right against the emu 's beak . <p> " Woark ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence and lay draped there , staring up at the gray sky . <p> At that point the emu pistol became too hot to hold , and I dropped it . It landed smoking beside Rufus , whose tail was still trapped under the emu 's foot . <p> Rufus looked up at me and yowled . <p> I lifted the emu 's foot and saw that Rufus 's tail had been pressed down into the muddy soil . It was dirty , but it did n't look broken . And the emu 's talons had missed it . I did n't blame Rufus for shrieking , though . <p> I picked him up , hugged him to my chest , and climbed back up to the Saturn . This time he did n't object when I put him into the carrier . And this time I made sure the door was latched . <p> Then I looked back at the emu . it had n't killed Rufus again , so I hoped I had n't killed it either . <p> I went back across the ditch and found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunting and javelin-stabs to the ribs , I lugged it off the fence and laid it on the ground . Then it lifted its head , and its legs began to twitch . It would have to be tied up . <p> I used the only thing I had . I pulled up my shirt , took off the rib belt , and wrapped the emu 's ankles together . I was n't sure the Velcro would hold , but it was the best I could do . <p> Then I picked up the cooling emu pistol . The barrel was warped , and something inside rattled like cracker crumbs . I flipped the switches back and forth , but the LEDs stayed dead . <p> I carried the pistol back up to the road ... and then I dropped it among the fragments of my Dodge , lifted my foot , and stomped it to bits . <p> The vet said that except for losing a little fur , Rufus was fine . And as for me , I discovered that I actually felt better without the rib belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A few weeks later , it was shipped two hundred miles north to the Dallas Zoo . Better them than us . ) <p> The only black mark on the day was that a few hours after Rufus and I returned to the house , Barb had to call from the coffee shop downtown to ask where I was . <p> All I could say was , " I 'm home . " <p> And so I am . But the world still seems a bit off kilter , and I 'm reminded of that every time look at the photos Barb took of me and my wrecked pickup . <p> In one of the photos , there are two of me . I 'm standing on either side of the Dodge 's crumpled engine compartment , and one of me is holding an emu pistol . And behind the truck , glaring around the corner of the camper shell , is an evil-eyed emu . <p> I 've shown this photo to my friends without telling them what I see in it . And as far as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sans emu pistol , sans , emu . <p> I have no explanation , and the only other piece of tangible evidence has been stomped . So I 've fallen back on what most people with no explanation or evidence fall back on : Belief . <p> Most often , I choose to believe that the wreck knocked my brain around just enough to result in a small shift in my perceptions , which in turn resulted in small discrepancies between the world I now perceive and the world I perceived prior to cracking up on Brodie Lane . <p> Other times , I entertain the quasi-religious notion that no one ever dies , but instead pops out in an **29;2045;TOOLONG reality in which he or she goes on living and driving and drinking coffee - and maybe even getting to pet a resurrected cat . <p> But whatever the truth may be , I 've discovered that the differences between this world and my previous one do n't often cause problems . In fact , I rather like the absence of rampaging emu and ostrich flocks , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And while I do miss the accomplishments of the Ferraro administration ( such as the Universal Health Care and Child-Proof Trigger Lock Initiative ) , at least the guys running the show in this new reality are keeping themselves busy . <p> So for the most part , things are going well . Barb got the job and likes it a lot . Our pets are old , but alive and happy . Herd Breakfast is as regular as the tides , and Caroline and Sven humiliate me at cutthroat pool precisely as I remember . My cracked bones have healed , and I have a new Dodge that 'll be paid off in five years , barring further reality shifts . <p> Once in a while , though , a difference between worlds does trip me up . So I 'd like to ask a favor . <p> If I 'm in the supermarket and I do n't seem to understand the concept of " Express Lane " ... or if I refer to the Prime Minister of Canada as " Michelle Pfeiffer " ... or if I attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch ... or if I see you playing a video game and say , " I thought those were taken off the market because of the tumors " ... or if I fail to understand the critical reasoning behind Oprah Winfrey 's book club selections ... <p> Please , have a little patience . Give me a break , and cut me some slack . Buy me a slab of beef ribs . <p> After all , I 'm new around here . <p> Author Affiliation
