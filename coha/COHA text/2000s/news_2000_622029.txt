<p> TRADE BACKERS IMMUNE FROM EFFECTS <p> Editor  --  Bill Clinton assembled a troop of living presidents to push China permanent normalized trade relations through Congress for him . Although the men endorsing the deal are distinguished and highly educated , they all have one quality that makes their view on China trade faulty ; they have never had to work for a living because they are among the elite . <p> George Bush will not lose his home because he lost a job welding bicycle frames because of China trade . <p> Gerald Ford will not have to sell his ski equipment at a garage sale because his pension plan closed early when the company moved to China . <p> That hard-working young man Jimmy Carter will not have to move back to Plains , Ga. , to live with relatives because his factory assembly job closed because of China trade . <p> Big business owes these politicians a living and it will provide for them , if they are fools or geniuses . <p> It could be time for veterans and working people and human-rights activists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualties to a massive deal with an oppressive regime . If that happens , permanent normalized trade relations for China do not stand a chance . <p> HAROLD TUCHEL <p> Waterloo , Iowa <p> . <p> IS NEUTERING CRUEL ? <p> Editor  --  As a cat lover for all of my 70-plus years , I want to question the Commission of Animal Control and Welfare when its proposes banning declawing of cats ( " Pet Peeve , " May 12 ) . It should be obvious to the commission , if the members know anything about cats , that declawing the indoor-house cat is a major step forward , making it possible to share the love and companionship of a cat , especially for the elderly . Some cats can be taught to use only scratching posts and some ca n't . Their scratches may be quite dangerous or even life-threatening to certain people . For an elderly person , in particular , to be deprived of a cat companion is not only regrettable but also illegal , as I understand it . <p> It is standard practice to declaw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . Or does the commission also feel that neutering is cruel ? <p> W. L. WARNER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> INVEST , DO N'T REBATE <p> Editor  --  " California is enormously blessed , " states Gov . Gray Davis ( " Governor Proposes Taxpayer Rebate " , May 12 ) . Yes , the state is now prosperous and because it is , rather than returning tax money to those who do not need it , let 's undo some of the damage created by the ( Gov . Pete ) Wilson " train wreck . " <p> During eight years of Republican administration , California 's infrastructure steadily declined  --  pot holes in our highways , overpasses and bridges not retrofitted for earthquakes , environmental treasures and wetlands not restored or protected , toxic-waste sites not cleaned up and schools left crumbling . Residents are still living in inadequate housing and lacking health insurance , the mentally and the physically challenged are roaming the streets without proper protections and services , and our working mothers do not have easily accessible or affordable child care . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice restaurant , a week end away , a new outfit ? Is this what Gov . Davis really feels is important ? Let 's tell the governor to stop pandering and to put forth policies that truly represent " family values . " <p> BARBARA MORTON <p> Larkspur <p> . <p> A ZOO SOLUTION <p> Editor  --  Once again , cat lovers and bird lovers square off over the feral cat problem ( " For the Birds , May 13 ) , while the California quail inches closer to extinction in Golden Gate Park . The SPCA presently spays and releases feral cats , preventing them from reproducing , but not from killing more birds . As a solution to this problem , I propose that the San Francisco Zoo establish a feral cat exhibit in lieu of their next planned exhibit . <p> Viewing domestic cats might not be as interesting as looking at tigers , but the exhibit could be advertised as the fruition of a win-win solution that spares the lives of feral cats , the California quail and other birds . <p> JEFFREY WEISS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor  --  As a member of the clergy , I read with interest the recent Open Forum commentary ( " Women and Abortion : Another Voice , " May 9 ) written by the coordinators of the Respect Life Ministry from the Catholic Dioceses of Oakland and San Francisco . <p> At Planned Parenthood Golden Gate , we believe that women are moral , competent decisionmakers . We also believe that every child deserves to be wanted , honored and loved . <p> As clever as the pro-choice ads on BART are , the issue is not the percentage of men versus women in the anti-choice movement . The real issue is , and always has been , who decides if a woman should have an abortion ? Is it the government ? Is it the church ? Or is the decision best made by the pregnant woman in consultation with her physician , her family and her God ? <p> I am proud to be a part of the majority of Americans who agree that women and their families  --  not the government  --  should make these difficult personal decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nationwide organization that helps prevent an estimated half-million unintended pregnancies and nearly 200,000 abortions each year . <p> The Rev. DONALD <p> CUNNINGHAM <p> Chairman , Board of Trustees <p> Planned Parenthood Golden Gate <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> MALE BIRTH CONTROL <p> Editor  --  We believe that women must have full control over their reproductive lives and that until this happens , women will not achieve equality . We also believe that women need to have access to information and services , so that they can make their own informed decisions about their bodies . This decision should not be imposed by strangers who are against abortion , even if these strangers are " feminist " women . <p> We praise The Chronicle for publishing the important pro-choice ad and we reject the absurd commentary of the anti-choice movement that supports revoking our right to choose the destiny of our own body . The anti-abortion movement should spend its time and energy supporting legislation for mandatory birth control for all unmarried men and sex offenders . <p> RAYONA SHARPNACK , <p> President , Institute <p> For Women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor  --  Re : " S.F. Baffled by Rise in Deaths of Single Poor , " May 13 ) . <p> I am one of the many San Francisco people living alone and quite likely to die alone ( can one die any other way ? ) . On the wall near my apartment door is a list of people to be informed of my death , with their telephone numbers . The list includes my church , and two people who have copies of my will . One of those people has a copy of my instructions for my funeral . <p> I suggest that everyone living alone have such a list , make a will , and send copies of the will to someone on the list . Funeral instructions should be deposited with one 's church ( for present purposes , the local office of American Atheists counts as a church ) . That should save the Public Administrator some bother . <p> JOHN A. WILLS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SEPARATE NEWS , PROFIT <p> Editor  --  Free-speech champion Alexander Meiklejohn said 50 years ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were he alive today , he would be appalled at the very idea of buying and selling newspapers as marketable commodities . He also said commercialism controls most of what we see and hear , and that manipulation of men is the destruction of self-government . Until news is separated from profit-making , we , as rank-and-file citizens , will never have stark journalistic honesty . <p> LOUIS WORTH JONES <p> San Mateo <p> . <p> ADD SOME COLOR <p> Editor  --  What 's with all the black clothes ? Every woman looks as if she just came from a funeral . The conformity is making me puke . This time is the worst I 've seen it for fashion in San Francisco . It 's springtime , ladies . Get some color in your life . Black is for people who are too lazy or too afraid to make a color choice ! <p> STEVE TYSON <p> San Francisco
