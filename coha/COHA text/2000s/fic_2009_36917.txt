WATER <p> Living in a small town , I hear a lot of things , but I 'm always surprised about what I do n't hear . Anyway , I 'm proud of Nicki . I 'm not sure my mother was ever proud of me . She said I was always losing my words and did n't know where to find them . <p> On Friday afternoon Willie Boots stands on the pitcher 's mound and scans the nearly empty bleachers , searching for Nicki . <p> Spring comes late to Jeffrey , New Hampshire , if it comes at all . Snow , then mud , the high school , located beyond the town limits at the base of Mount Blue , schedules twenty games and is lucky to play half of them . This year the weather has been worse than usual . Finally , though , the sun has broken through , melting the curls of snow under the pines , the fingers of crusty ice in the lee of the granite boulders strewn beyond the outfield . <p> The beginning of Memorial Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Willie 's last game , too . His junior year Willie won five games and lost one . This year he 's won only one and lost four . The team has n't been hitting this year , he tells himself . No defense , either . <p> The coach is leaving Willie in the game , a courtesy to Wesley Boots , Willie 's father , who paid for the scoreboard . Above the green words Boots and Associates the score reads Cougars 2 , Visitors 10 . Willie would rather let someone else pitch . Mike , the catcher and Willie 's closest friend , knows what Willie is thinking . <p> Mike walks to the mound and slaps the ball into Willie 's glove . " Hey man , three more outs , then we 're out of here . Just concentrate . " <p> " You think she could have shown up for one game , " Willie says . <p> " Concentrate . Nicki can wait until later . " <p> " Yeah , later . " Willie nods and smiles . " Later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the plate , and signals for a fastball , inside corner . Willie shakes his head . He wants a curveball , his best pitch , outside corner , or any corner for that matter . Willie taps the ball three times into the pocket of his glove , something he always does before beginning his windup . He throws a curve . The batter pops it up . Easy out . <p> Mike , mask on top of his head , is yelling encouragement while the team throws the ball around the infield . Part of the ritual . It 's what Willie likes about baseball , the rituals of the game , the way you do the same things over and over . That 's why he goes to church , sometimes . Order , repetition . Now , though , the season almost finished- " Just give me the damn ball , " Willie says . <p> Tap , tap , tap , ball to glove . Down the middle , a fastball . Willie turns to watch the center and right fielders running toward the pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on . Practice , a few days ago . He could n't figure out why she was staying so late after school . She was like that , appearing unexpectedly , then disappearing . She hiked a lot . You could see how strong she was , her legs and shoulders . He decided to say hello . <p> The coach yelled at him . Screw the coach . Nicki sat with her legs tucked under her , a revealing position for a girl wearing a short skirt . She wore skirts more than other girls . She was different from them , too-aloof , haughty maybe . She glanced up but did n't move her legs . As Willie approached , he could see her underwear , white , with a sheen , silk maybe , definitely not cotton . Willie was n't an expert , but he was familiar with Victoria 's Secret catalogs . He was n't an expert with girls either , especially not someone like Nicki , beautiful and smart , who preferred skirts to jeans , who was headed for Princeton . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , Division III , a place where he might play more baseball . He noticed , though , that Nicki did n't move or attempt to hide anything . It was like she was offering to let him see all he wanted . Or daring him . <p> " Hey , " Willie said . Nicki said hey to Willie . " My dad said I could take out his boat . Friday night . Want to come along ? " <p> " Who else ? " Nicki asked . <p> " Mike and Celeste . " <p> " Not sure about Friday , " Nicki said . She was n't sure about any other day either . She wanted an excuse not to go . <p> " Your dad and my dad work together , " Willie said . <p> " My dad works for your dad , " Nicki said . She wondered if Mr. Boots would approve of Willie 's strategy . He probably would . When Nicki had spoken to Mr. Boots at the bank or Cave 's CafT , she was aware of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you and me took a boat ride . " <p> " You mean you and I , our fathers would like it ? " <p> " Sure they would . " <p> " I do n't know much about boats . " <p> In fact , Nicki had lived almost all her life close to one of the largest and deepest lakes in the state , Merrimack Lake that begins at the western edge of town and stretches across two counties . Nicki has never swum in it , has never boated on it . Water 's all right to look at , but she considers herself a land person . <p> The coach yelled again . Willie waved in his direction . " Think about it . Tell me tomorrow . " <p> Now the runner stands on third . Mike is at the mound again to talk to Willie . The umpire is strolling in their direction to break up the conference , his chest protector bouncing with every step . <p> " No more fastballs , " Willie says . <p> " All right . Shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's get this over with . " <p> Willie throws curves . The batter strikes out . One more to go . Mike is laughing and signaling Willie with his middle finger . Willie starts into his windup but has to back off the rubber . He 's laughing too . <p> The coach yells something . Coach is always yelling something . In the distance Willie sees black sky , a cold front moving in . Willie studies weather . The cold riding over the warm air already in place , he predicts a foggy night . That could make the boat ride all the more interesting . <p> Ann Haber sits on one of the benches in front of the library , her face lifted to the sun , her sleeves pushed up . She closes her eyes and inhales the fragrance of apple blossoms . After months of dryness , her skin soaks up the warm , moist air , so palpable she can almost see its texture . <p> Down Main Street the bell in the Baptist church 's steeple rings four o'clock . The previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk . Saturday had been Shippen College 's commencement . Its two hundredth since the founding of Shippen Academy , its seventy-first since the academy became a junior college for women , its thirtieth since the junior college became a four-year women 's college , its tenth since the college admitted men , a decision provoking on the college 's lawn a confrontation that spilled across Main Street into Ann Haber 's yard , where it ended with the town 's two police cruisers blocking the road while the unhappy dozen or so undergraduates embraced each other , wept , and consoled themselves with whatever Ann could offer them . The deputies did not interfere as she poured wine into paper cups for anyone who wanted it . <p> Now the town would stay quiet until Father 's Day , when the blackflies would stop biting and the owners of summer cottages on the lake would return from winters in Florida or Arizona , crowding Vivaldi 's Market by nine in the morning , the post office by ten . Now you could find a place to park on Main Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room at the inn . <p> Ann waves to Nicki as she passes by . Some people are lucky ; Nicki is one of them . Intelligent , lovely , admitted to Princeton-she might be going home to a cold house on a dirt road in the Northeast Kingdom , her past but not her future . The Grohs , Harriet and Sheldon , adopted Nicki in Vermont . Her mother and father , never married to each other , are dead-he in a fire in a trailer park , she in the Connecticut River , a drowning , alcohol thought to be a contributing factor . These details Harriet has passed on to Ann , in confidence . Ann 's sure that Nicki does n't know what happened to her parents , though she 's unsure whether Harriet and Sheldon agree on how much Nicki should know . The Grohs , in Ann 's opinion , get along well , but they never strike Ann as being in love . They lack passion , she thinks . Maybe in private they 're different , but Ann doubts it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriet and warning herself not to . <p> Across the street , Wesley Boots is exiting the bank . He pauses , patting his pockets for his sunglasses . He catches sight of Nicki walking toward the QuikMart or the bookstore , probably the bookstore . He 's relieved he does n't have a daughter , a daughter with a body like Nicki 's . He wonders how Sheldon feels about skirts that short . Maybe he does n't care . Sheldon 's always been slightly remote where Nicki is concerned . Perhaps detached is a better word . Sheldon has told Wesley that the adoption was Harriet 's idea . In conversations at the office or riding to job sites , Sheldon scarcely mentions Nicki . She 's going to Princeton , for God 's sake , and Sheldon has never said much about it except to remark how much Princeton costs . <p> Off to New Jersey with her long legs tanned thanks to a spring break spent in Hawaii . Wesley imagines Nicki in a tiny black bathing suit . She reclines beside a pool of blue water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear a suit like that , and those short skirts . Harriet dresses herself as if she was a college girl . Once Sheldon and Wesley were drinking at the inn 's bar , watching a Red Sox game on television . I do n't understand who Harriet 's trying to impress , Sheldon said . The other day a high school student whistled at her . Wesley wondered if the whistler was being sarcastic . When Sheldon did n't say anything more , Wesley decided Sheldon was wondering the same thing . As Wesley watches Nicki turn toward the bookstore , he ca n't believe his son convinced her to join a boat ride . <p> Wesley glances across the street and notices Ann Haber . To be polite , he waves . Politeness is expected in a small town , a village really , like Jeffrey . But Wesley does n't care much for Ann Haber . In a community where politeness rules , those who have opinions about Ann Haber 's private life call her " athletic . " It 's not Ann 's reputed interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobbishness . Her family has been in Jeffrey forever . She owns more buildable property than anyone else , and she wo n't let Wesley or anyone else build on an inch of it . She 's even funded a conservancy to protect other people 's land from being developed , " exploited " according to her , by people like himself , like Wesley Boots , although she never refers to him by name . One thing he 'll say for her : those blue eyes can bore right through you and put you in your place . The lesbian thing ... Wesley shakes his head and unlocks his Blazer , the company car , built in America . In northern New Hampshire clients respect American made . <p> Instead of entering the bookstore , Nicki walks around the building , formerly a cottage belonging to the caretaker of the Baptist church and converted into a commercial property by Wesley Boots . She pauses at the edge of a parking lot shared by several businesses . She looks for the small black car . <p> Fran has been waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive in winter . Fran . Francis . Francis X. Hennessy , twenty-three years old , a math teacher at the high school since September . A hard teacher , the students call him the X-man . X , you 're done for , they say , drawing their fingers across their throats . <p> Nicki poses for him , at least he thinks that 's what she 's doing , reaching up to rearrange her hair , narrowing her gaze to find Fran behind the windshield bright with late-afternoon sun . Dark eyes and darker brows that arch and thin upward toward her forehead ; a long , oval face and a thin nose , widening above generous lips , open as if she was blowing away a feather , or pollen , or dust , or the hair on Fran 's arm . Winter Saturday afternoons , Nicki has been Fran 's warmth in a cold climate ; while the two lay before the fireplace filled with rosy embers , the incense from candles scented the air and settled on their skin . <p> The prescription ( written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor Harriet had not met ) was n't exactly hidden , though it was n't immediately visible under a jar of Carmex in Nicki 's medicine cabinet , which Harriet had opened to find out if Nicki needed more toothpaste or floss . Harriet took the pink dispenser , a month 's supply of pills , and sat on Nicki 's bed pressing the plastic between her palms . She felt betrayed . The ground had shifted under her . Positions had changed . There had always been closeness between Harriet and Nicki , an intimacy less between a mother and daughter , or so Harriet believed , than between two friends , one more experienced than the other , who could tell each other anything , or everything . Other mothers noticed too . Some were put off by it . What can Harriet be thinking when her daughter asks about touching herself and Harriet answers with advice and a personal history ? Some , envious , were not put off . They shrugged and suggested that Harriet and Nicki had never bonded as mother and daughter . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boundaries did n't exist for them . <p> The first betrayal Harriet felt was Nicki 's not informing her that she wanted birth control . Which meant , Harriet assumed , that Nicki needed it , but Harriet was at a loss to guess who Nicki was involved with-another betrayal . Nicki had always been open about her friends and what they did , even when she knew Harriet would disapprove and ask her to reconsider , such as the occasional weekend evenings when Nicki and her friends drove to Hanover to celebrate a birthday or the end of exams , mixing with the Dartmouth students , helping themselves to the available supply of alcohol and toking on the joint someone handed them . Sheldon would have grounded Nicki , but , of course , he was n't concerned as long as she was home when she was supposed to be . <p> A few leftover cluster flies buzzed against the bedroom windows warm with fading October light . Betrayal muted to jealousy , a feeling that Harriet often experienced when she compared her adolescence with Nicki 's . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going steady , engaged to be engaged , she did n't , and could n't , waltz into a doctor 's office and waltz out with a prescription for contraception . The child who might have been born Harriet named Sam , short for Samuel or Samantha . The person to whom she was engaged to be engaged had joined the Army , the last she heard about him . <p> Who , then , was Nicki seeing ? One person came to mind , the handsome man who showed up in early August to settle in and prepare to teach math . Fran something . Harriet and her friends Kimberly and Alice were sitting at an outside table at Jack 's Coffee , drinking mid-morning lattes , talking , watching the cars go up and down Main Street , the early arrivals at the college . There he was on his way into the coffee bar . Oh , is n't he good looking , Kimberly said . Alice was on the school board . Our Mr. Hennessy , she said , explaining he had been hired to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for thirty years and was taking a year off and might decide to retire and stay out West . Our Mr. Hennessy , six feet tall , a hundred and sixty pounds , more or less , blond hair , rather long , in Alice 's opinion , though Harriet liked the way Mr. Hennessy combed his hair straight back . It reminded her of that professional basketball coach whose name she could n't remember . She had seen his picture in the sports page of The New York Times . Mr. Hennessy dressed in chinos , a black T-shirt , and a jacket that might have been linen , a tad expensive in Alice 's view of what first-year math teachers were entitled to wear . Well , he had graduated from Williams , Alice remarked , as if his college affiliation explained all . <p> But Nicki was n't enrolled in a math course . She mentioned other teachers but not Mr. Hennessy . Just because Harriet found him attractive should n't mean that Nicki was attracted to him . She might not even know him . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Harriet sat on Nicki 's bed . The windows darkened . The flies stopped buzzing . A ladybug inched across the sill . The last weekend of daylight saving time . Next Monday , the sun would have set by now and Nicki would walk home from the library in the dark . Sheldon had offered to buy Nicki a used car , a Honda or Toyota , something reliable . All her friends had cars . So I do n't need one , Nicki said . She could always get a ride from school to town . She preferred to do homework in the library , a ten-minute walk from the house . <p> Kimberly had nudged Harriet when Mr. Hennessy left the coffee bar and folded himself into a small , shiny car . He 's going to regret driving that come snow , she remarked . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
