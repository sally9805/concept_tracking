Los Angeles was freezing but Hobart Bosworth was drenched in his own sweat . His undershirt was plastered to his body and droplets ran like spring-fed creeks down his back . He had run down Spring to catch the little Central trolley , which was already trundling away from its most recent stop , nearly certain that Rhea Haines , one of the Famous Player starlets , but more importantly one of Rudisill 's girlfriends , had seen him outside the Alexandria Hotel . As she was across the street and not on guard , as he was , he had spotted her first . The cab he had been hailing was more than a block away , and her motion indicated she was turning and would have seen him before he could escape in it . So he ran . He had n't heard his name called out , which made him think that perhaps there was a slim chance he had slipped out of her sight . It was hard to tell . He was one of the tallest men in Hollywood , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tan wool suit . Normally a slender part of his vanity would have been pleased to have been noticed by someone he knew . But these times were extreme and he was desperate . <p> Gossip . That 's what he was worried about . The path of gossip was like a lit fuse heading toward a keg of TNT . Or a snowball rolling downhill , gathering more snow . Or maybe a snowball made of TNT , he was n't sure . Whichever it was , if she had seen him she would certainly gossip about it to Rudisill . Rudisill would tell Garbutt . Garbutt would tell Zukor . And his proverbial dynamite snowball would explode . Garbutt and Zukor , and probably Rudisill , all thought that he was in Arizona . Because that 's what he had told them . When they found out he was still in Los Angeles they might find out where he was really going . Which could destroy everything he had worked to build . <p> As he reached for the brass rail of the trolley the thought crossed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty Mrs. Smith that she wanted . Instead he had cast Fritzi Scheff as the eponymous heroine , after all , she was prettier . Maybe if Rhea had been cast she would have been so grateful that Hobart would fear no malice in her heart that would cause her to gossip about him . His actresses trusted him and he could trust them . There was a bond that formed . He knew how to make them look good and draw great performances from them , make them shine . <p> Rudisill , Garbutt , Zukor ; these were powerful , rich men . More powerful than he even though he was a studio company owner and picture star . They were certainly wealthier . Wealth and power was what mattered to Rhea and other girls like her  --  the ones who were n't going to get the big roles and become famous . The girls who were flooding into Los Angeles as if the dam holding back beautiful girls had burst somewhere just outside the town limits . She was looking out for herself the way a pretty girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it worked out here in Hollywoodland and he could n't blame her . He did n't have to like it or her . But he could n't blame her . And she just had n't been right for the part , after all . <p> His tortured lungs raged against the abuse . He had fought back against the years of tuberculosis with vigorous exercise , and the warm , dry California climate had helped immensely . But for some reason , running turned breathing into an agony akin to inhaling fire . He slid onto an empty bench and sat up against the window , closing his eyes . He focused on slowing his breathing down , the way he had been taught in the sanatorium back in Arizona , by inhaling through his nose and out through his mouth . With any luck the ache would soon recede . His eyes closed , he listened to the sounds of the city : the beeping of the automobiles , the grinding of the streetcar wheels on metal , the clip-clop of a horse-drawn delivery wagon , the murmurs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , too  --  a familiar blend of dust and ocean , laced with a hint of orange . He never grew tired of the smell of Los Angeles . It seemed as if it was the fragrance of promise , and as he considered himself an optimist , whenever he caught a whiff of that particular blend , he always felt a little inward surge of forward momentum , a burst of hope . Even now , with threats of disaster hanging over him , he could n't help but feel a little bit better . After all , he had a plan . <p> When he was finally able to inhale deeply and exhale through his mouth , he opened his eyes . The tall buildings of downtown , the Security Savings Bank , the Grosse Building , the Lankershim Hotel receded as the streetcar came up on the new auto-dealership district . After this , he rode past large tracts of undeveloped land interrupted by periodic eruptions of new small neighborhoods . If it were n't for the quality of the light , which was much brighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was at once attractive and repugnant . <p> He breathed a healthy-sounding sigh of relief as the streetcar bounced roughly onto the Electric Avenue line . The winter of 1915 had rolled in early and hard , and the orange trees had quickly been stripped of life and reduced to their twisted , gnarled bones . Hobart loosened his necktie and settled back against the rattan seat , letting the cool breeze blowing in from the Pacific dry his damp clothes . The more he pieced together the moments of the encounter  --  separating it from his emotions  --  the more confident he became that Rhea had not seen him . But that did n't change the fact that he still had to hightail it out of Los Angeles . <p> The trolley crested a hill , and from this vantage point he could see the sharp ribbons of glittering cobalt blue cut into the landscape just above the shoreline . It was a fascinating sight to Hobart . Only in Los Angeles , he thought . Only in a town in which the stock in trade was dreams could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreating the canals of Venice . And only in Los Angeles would anybody have ever thought it was a good idea . On close examination the genuine city of Venice , rising from its azure lagoon , was in and of itself a horrendous idea but at least its inspiration had been grounded in something resembling sense  --  to provide a natural defense against marauders and easy access to the commerce that traveled by sea . But this California Venice had been built ten years ago as an adventure in speculative real estate development  --  acres and acres plowed under and dug up , millions of dollars spent , all to create an interesting destination for the trolley . The imaginary made inevitable . <p> By the time he disembarked at the small station in front of the Lagoon Amphitheater opposite the amusement pier , only his damp collar remained as a reminder of his earlier mad dash . The thrill rides were shuttered for the season , the massive Ferris wheel , the twisting Automobile Races , the Mill Ride , and the Journey through Hades . A few old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters beyond the surf . Hobart had never seen one fish caught from a pier in all the time he had spent on waterfronts in his life . But he always admired the optimism of the fisherman . <p> He turned his collar up and pulled his hat down against the chill wind that was blowing in off the ocean . Overhead a biplane bounced through the bright atmosphere , heading toward or coming from Ince Aviation Field in the distance . Behind him the imported Venetian gondolas tied to posts at the boathouse and grouped together like a log jam on the river thumped hollowly against one another . There were no lovers to ride today , nor gondoliers to serenade them . <p> Hobart walked east along what the residents referred to as the Grim Canal . The sea pumps that kept the lattice of carved waterways filled appeared to be under repair  --  their natural state it seemed  --  and the water was turning brackish with the waste from the settlement . It was one true thing , he noted , that Venice had in common with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the temperatures rose , so did the open sewer smell . Already there were community voices calling for filling in the canals and paving them under . He passed a flier drifting just below the surface of the water  --  a call to rally against the Kaiser in the great war raging in Europe . There were always people calling for change of some kind or another  --  pave Venice under or save Mother Russia  --  all the same . <p> He made a left and took the bridge that crossed the canal past the shuttered summer cottages , over another bridge across the Altair Canal , until he reached the small cluster of bungalows on U.S. Island . At the door of one , nearly hidden behind the great ferns in the small front yard , he gave the knocker a few loud taps , then waited for the footsteps . Soon enough the door swung open . Willoughby Hollis blinked and squinted into the sudden sunlight , trying to focus his bloodshot eyes on the figure on his doorstep . <p> After a long look he nodded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He took a step back and let Hobart enter . The stuntman smelled of juniper berries and strong pipe tobacco , and so did his small house . <p> " How have you been , Champ ? " The lights were off and the curtains were drawn . Hollis shut the door with his left hand , keeping his right arm tucked tightly against his body . <p> " Better than ever , " he replied , seemingly unaware of the spastic twitch his head gave as punctuation to his sentence . <p> " I was just over at the Alexandria looking for you . Allan Dwan 's there rounding up every cowboy he can find for his new Fairbanks picture . The Good Bad Man . " <p> Hollis shrugged with disinterest . <p> " Working much ? " <p> " Keepin ' my head up , " he replied , shuffling toward the kitchen . " Want some java ? I got some on . " <p> " Sure . " He sat down in a club chair , recognizing it as one of the pieces he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobart Bosworth Productions with the film The Sea Wolf . Willoughby had taken them away when the wear and tear began to show on film . Now the leather cover was cracked and the cotton stuffing was leaking out in tufts . Willoughby came back carrying two large clay mugs , more props that Hobart recognized  --  these from his Canadian stories . Again , Willoughby kept his right arm close , even though it made holding the mug awkward . He handed Bosworth the other mug from his left hand . <p> " Busted rib ? " Hobart gave a slight indication to Willoughby 's right side . <p> " Ribs , " he said with a groan as he lowered himself into the club chair 's twin on the other side of the small coffee table . " Three of ' em . " His head snapped spastically again and he grinned , revealing the bloody gap between his incisors . " A rough shoot . " <p> He was lying . Hobart knew that if Willoughby had been injured in a fight scene that he would have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries were not the result of a staged bar fight gone out of control and they were n't from a fall off a horse . Willoughby had been picking up money at the Friday night fights . <p> Hobart had met Willoughby in a match in Chicago years earlier when they were both in their early twenties  --  before Hobart had heard the call of the stage lights . Willoughby was the more experienced of the two , and slightly bigger . But the difference then , as it was now , was that Willoughby seemed to like the punishment of the ring and used it to fuel his combat , whereas Hobart avoided pain at all costs by striking earlier and faster . It was one of the reasons why Hobart 's nose remained straight , and long , and handsome , while Willoughby 's was spread across his face like the flattened mesas in Monument Valley . It was also one of the reasons why he had been , at least at one time , one of the most in-demand stuntmen in town . <p> In their first meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the bigger man drooling on the canvas and fumbling for his mouthpiece . To Willoughby , the only man he could respect was one who had whupped him , which meant that he respected very few men . To those he did , his loyalty was deep and faithful and always earnestly surprising . When Hobart had succumbed to the lure of the movies , his friend left the fight and rodeo circuits behind to join him . As Bosworth 's star had ascended , so did his need for a stunt double . Willoughby 's physique was enough like his that he could pass on film . Hobart 's hope was that there was still enough of that resemblance now for him to fool another more perceptive and less forgiving audience . <p> " I 'm hoping what brought you out here was some of that money you owed me , " Willoughby said , the missing teeth turning his " s " sounds into sputtering lisps . <p> " To my recollection we 're all square . The lawyer that kept you from going to jail on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd have taken my pinch . At least I 'd a had some of my life savin 's waitin ' for me when I came out . " <p> " You made an investment in my company , same as others have . " <p> " And when 's that gon na start payin ' off for me again exactly ? " <p> " You know , it 's not a sure thing , show business . We 're doing about as well as anybody else . But the houses take their share , and the distributors , and then there 's equipment and the Teamsters . " <p> " And you have n't had a hit since Sea Wolf . " <p> " My pictures do well . " <p> " But you have n't had a hit in two years . And hits pay the bills . And pay back investors . So I have n't got my money back . " He rubbed his left hand over his right side . <p> " There 's a gig , " Hobart said . " A good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gig ? I do n't know if you could tell by lookin ' at me , but I ai n't in shape for fallin ' down right now . Or much of anything else . " <p> " It 's a part , " he replied . " A real part . " <p> Willoughby laughed . " Acting ? I 'd rather fall off a roof . You ca n't put this mug on film . You 'd scare away the audience . We 're trying to make money , remember ? " <p> " It 's a part you can play . I know you 'll be good at it . " <p> " What is it ? The part ? " <p> " Me . " <p> " Come again ? " <p> " I need you to play me . " <p> " That 's gon na be some kind of picture . " <p> " It 's not a picture . I need you to move into my house and pretend you 're me . " <p> " Over in Westlake ? And give up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's more to it than that . " <p> " I said okay . " <p> " Hang on , Champ . I 've been putting it out that my tuberculosis is back . I 've been out to Arizona for some treatment and now I 'm shutting myself in to recuperate . " <p> " You ai n't sick ? " Willoughby drew back slightly . <p> Hobart shook his head . " No . But you were right about needing a hit . In fact , we need a hit real bad . Birth of a Nation big . But without the troubles . One hit will put us in great shape . Hobart Bosworth Productions will be the going concern in town . Bigger than Biograph . Bigger than Famous Players . There are people who know that . People who want a piece . " <p> " Other investors ? " <p> " Something like that . " <p> " Jesus , Bosworth . When are you going to realize that you 're just an actor , not a businessman ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for people to think that I 'm still in town . " <p> " Where are you going to be ? " <p> " North . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " Will you do it or wo n't you ? " <p> " Well , hell , brother ! I already said I 'd do it . " <p> " So you 'll lay low and let people think it 's me holed up in my home ? " <p> " With this face the way it is right now it 's just as well I stay indoors . " <p> Hobart stood up and fished for his keys . " You 're the only one who knows . I 've had to let the servant staff go . " Willoughby , taking the keys , shook his head at the word " servant . " " The larder and bar are fully stocked . There 's everything you need plus five hundred dollars in cash in an envelope in the desk in my study . " He did n't want to mention that the sum amounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth ; the rest he carried on him . If his plan worked as he hoped then the money would be flowing again soon . " If anyone calls you just answer the phone , sound like me sick , and tell them to go away . Do n't let anyone in at the gate . But let yourself be seen by passersby and delivery boys at the head of the path . " <p> " How long will you be away to the north ? " <p> " Only a week or so , I hope . " He heard the distant buzzing of the biplane again . He hoped his gear had arrived at the airfield safely . He 'd had to use a courier service that would n't recognize his name instead of the regular studio messenger . He would know soon enough ; a quick glance at his pocket watch showed that he was due to meet his charter in half an hour . " You 'll do it ? " <p> " How many times do I have to say I 'll do it ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go today ? " <p> " As soon as I wrap up my affairs . " <p> " I 'm serious . " <p> " Relax , chum , " Willoughby said with a horrifying grin . " I 'm on my way already . " <p> Hobart opened the door and the brightness startled him . He had grown accustomed to the darkness of Willoughby 's home . He felt Willoughby moving up behind him . <p> " What 's your big plan for getting a hit ? What are you going to do ? " <p> Hobart Bosworth watched the small red plane on the horizon head in for a landing . " I 'm going to catch a wolf . " <p> Copyright 2008 by Paul Malmont <br> Continues ...
