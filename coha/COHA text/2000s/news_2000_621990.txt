<p> " Less is more " has never been a part of Microsoft 's philosophy , and to judge by the handheld " Pocket PCs " the software giant and its hardware partners rolled out yesterday , it still is n't . <p> In fact , the new gadgets reflect just the opposite approach to product design . <p> Palm , the current leader in the handheld-organizer market , has earned that position by focusing on such Zen-like values as simplicity , low price and long battery life . But instead of competing on those fronts , Microsoft and friends  --  chiefly , in this context , Casio , Compaq and Hewlett-Packard  --  have fallen back on the same strategy that has served them so well in the PC arena : trying to outmuscle the opposition with hardware horsepower and software features . <p> In those terms , they 've clearly succeeded : The new devices , like the HP Jornada 545 I 've been trying out for the past 10 days , are amazingly versatile . Microsoft is n't just kidding in calling them " Pocket PCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at 9 ounces , noticeably heavier than even the largest competing products from Palm , it still fits easily in a pocket or purse . <p> And even though Pocket PC wo n't run actual PC programs , the new platform is designed to handle most of the tasks most users do on full-size desktop or notebook systems  --  not just tracking personal information like names , addresses and appointments , but also surfing the Web , sending and receiving e-mail , reading and editing or even creating Word and Excel documents , playing M music and even editing digital snapshots . <p> With a list of capabilities that long , the Pocket PC is bound to be Microsoft 's strongest challenge yet to Palm 's grip on the handheld category . But all that power comes at a price , not just in dollars ( $499 list , in the case of the Jornada 545 ) but also in complexity , even though Microsoft has made a valiant effort to streamline its handheld software . <p> Inside the Jornada 545 is a Hitachi processor running at 133 megahertz  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fast enough to make the Pocket PC 's stripped-down software pretty snappy . There 's no hard drive  --  the operating system and core applications are stored permanently in 16 megabytes of read-only memory , while additional programs and data you create or download are stored in 16 megabytes of RAM . <p> BASIC SPECS <p> The color touch screen measures about 2.2 by 3 inches , with a resolution of 240 by 320 pixels . Unlike Palm and Casio , which use active-matrix displays in their color models , HP opted for the passive-matrix variety , which costs less and saves battery life but is also markedly less bright and crisp . <p> In fact , at its default settings , the Jornada screen is rather dim and marred by " shadows " of on-screen objects . I managed to eliminate those problems , but only by overriding the defaults to increase the brightness , thereby taking an extra bite out of battery life . <p> The battery is a lithium-ion pack that 's supposed to last through eight hours of continuous use or about two weeks of normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other color models . <p> That means you 'll probably want to bring a charger along if you 're planning to use the device heavily when traveling  --  you ca n't just pop in new removable batteries . But it should n't be an issue most of the time , because most users are likely to keep the device in its docking cradle when working at their desks , and the batteries are automatically recharged in the cradle . <p> For connecting to a PC , the Jornada comes with a docking cradle that requires a Universal Serial Bus connection . Fortunately for those who have older machines that lack USB ports , for users of Windows 95 and NT ( which do n't support USB ) , and for travelers who do n't want to carry the cradle , HP is also including , at least for now , a cable that connects the Jornada to an old-fashioned serial port . <p> Other hardware features include a built-in microphone , making it possible to use the device for recording voice notes , and both a built-in speaker and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you use the device to play digital music . There 's also an infrared port that 's supposed to provide wireless connections to many notebook PCs , printers and cell phones  --  more on that later . <p> Unlike Palm handhelds , Pocket PCs have an industry-standard expansion slot , so it 's easy to add extra memory , a modem or a network adapter . None of those is included , but I tried a 56K modem from Pretec Electronics and an Ethernet card from Socket Communications ; both were easy to install and worked well . <p> I had one serious hardware problem with the Jornada : On three different occasions , it suddenly presented me with urgent low-battery warnings even though it was sitting in its cradle and , by all appearances , connected to an AC outlet . <p> Later , just as mysteriously , the system resumed charging , but at this point , it 's working only intermittently . Not good . <p> SOFTWARE GALORE <p> The software that runs the Pocket PC is actually a new version of the operating system formerly known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moniker , apparently judging that it 's too tarnished by the failure of previous CE releases . <p> That 's understandable , and I reckon few will miss the CE name , but it 's too bad Bill Gates or Steve Ballmer could n't come up with more concise replacement than the ungainly  --  and misleading  --  " Windows Powered " label that Pocket PC devices carry . <p> Along with the underlying OS , the device 's 16-megabyte ROM includes stripped-down " pocket " versions of many of Microsoft 's Windows applications : Outlook ( for contacts , appointments , notes and e-mail ) ; Internet Explorer ( for browsing the Web itself when connected to the Internet and pages stored on the device when off-line ) ; the Windows Media Player ( capable of playing M files as well as Microsoft 's own digital music format ) ; and Microsoft Money , Word and Excel . <p> Also built in is a program called Microsoft Reader , which is intended for reading electronic books . It uses Clear Type , a new display technology Microsoft has been touting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read through one of the sample books that comes with it  --  " The Emperor 's New Clothes "  --  and did n't find the text any sharper than on other screens . I doubt even the most gung-ho of technology enthusiasts will ever enjoy reading a book on a 2-inch-by-3-inch display . <p> HP also provides some useful utilities of its own , and the CD-ROMs that accompany the Jornada offer a slew of additional titles you can load if you want . The list includes Microsoft Pocket Streets ( for viewing maps downloaded from your PC ) ; Microsoft Transcriber ( a cursive handwriting recognizer , if you 're not satisfied with the software keyboard and excellent printing recognizer that are built in ) ; a mini-application that retrieves AOL Mail ( when you 're online , of course ) ; a digital image-editing program ; and Yahoo Messenger , an instant-messaging and news-retrieval tool ( again , useless without an Internet connection ) . <p> Finally , there are three packages that run on your PC : ActiveSync 3.1 , which does a good job managing data exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version ) ; and MusicMatch Jukebox 4.4 ( a top-rated program for creating and organizing M music ) . <p> I tried most of this software , if only briefly , and with the exception of Transcriber , which evoked memories of early Apple Newtons , it all worked as advertised . Microsoft has thoroughly remodeled its user interface , getting rid of many of the features that cluttered up previous versions of Windows CE . <p> On the whole , the new interface is much more efficient , but it could still use a fair amount of tweaking . In a few cases , Gates ' minions went too far in removing buttons  --  when a reminder about a calendar event appears on screen , for example , there 's no way to jump directly to the associated item in Pocket Outlook to check on the details . <p> In other cases , Microsoft did n't simplify enough : Quitting a running program to free up memory , for example , requires seven clicks . <p> A bigger problem : The 16 megabytes of RAM that come standard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who want to take advantage of the full range of Pocket PC 's capabilities . <p> Of course , you can add more memory in the form of a CompactFlash card , but you 'll have to remove it anytime you want to plug in , for instance , a modem . If you really want to use more than the basic , built-in Pocket PC applications , you 'd probably be better off waiting for the Jornada 548 , a version with 32 megabytes of built-in RAM that HP expects to ship in a few months . That one , though , will set you back a hefty $599 . <p> SYNCHING UP <p> Early versions of Window CE had pretty pathetic data-synchronization software , compared with the Palm Desktop . ActiveSync 3.1 , however , works very well , once you get your connections set up . I had no problem using the serial cable , but to my surprise , the USB cradle gave me some trouble  --  I was n't completely surprised that I could n't get it to work with my desktop Windows 98 PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Handspring Visor , but I was amazed that I could n't get it going ( even after spending hours reinstalling devices and drivers ) with an HP OmniBook laptop . <p> As for the infrared port , trying to use it proved a full-scale nightmare . Part of the problem is that most laptops , even though equipped with IR ports , leave them disabled by default ; you have to go into the PC BIOS to enable it . And since the manuals mentioned nothing about that , and Windows 98 kept claiming that the problem was a software error , it took me a while to figure out that the BIOS was the issue . <p> Even then , fixing it was n't easy  --  I spent more than 45 minutes on the phone with a senior HP support technician before we arrived at a combination of settings that let me connect the Jornada and the OmniBook . And I never did manage to get the IR ports on two Compaq laptops to work , even with the settings that solved the problem on the OmniBook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this : Microsoft has never produced a Mac version of its handheld connectivity software , so you ca n't hook up a Pocket PC even if you have a USB Mac or a PowerBook with infrared . <p> BOTTOM LINE <p> I 've been using a palm-size Windows CE device  --  a Cassiopeia E-100 from Casio  --  for nearly a year , with a lot of satisfaction , and I had high hopes that the Pocket PC would be a significant improvement . I am impressed with the new platform 's potential , but given the high price of the current units and the numerous rough edges and glitches I ran into , I plan to stick with what I have . <p> Particularly puzzling to me is that none of the Pocket PCs announced so far includes a modem or , better yet , a wireless radio . A pocket-size device that included Internet Explorer , Outlook e-mail , AOL Mail and Yahoo Messenger would be pretty compelling if it came , at a reasonable price , with the hardware you need to take advantage of those programs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pocket PC " versions of : <p> Pre-installed <p>  --  Internet Explorer <p>  --  MS Word <p>  --  MS Excel <p>  --  MS Money <p>  --  Windows Media Player ( plays M and Microsoft-format music files ) <p>  --  Microsoft Reader ( for electronic books ) <p> . <p> Included on CD-ROM : <p>  --  MS Outlook 2000 ( full retail version for desktop PC ) <p>  --  MS Pocket Streets ( for viewing maps on Pocket PC ) <p>  --  AOL Mail Client <p>  --  Yahoo Messenger ( instant messaging ) <p>  --  Music Match Jukebox 4.4 ( for converting CD music to M ) <p>  --  Sierra Imaging Image Expert CE ( for editing digital photos on handheld ) <p> . <p> Features <p>  --  16 megabytes RAM <p>  --  16 megabytes ROM ( permanent program storage ) <p>  --  133 megahertz Hitachi processor <p>  --  2 1/4-by-3-inch backlit LCD screen ( 240 by 320 pixels , 65,536 colors ) <p>  --  Built-in lithium-ion rechargeable battery ( 8-hour continous battery <p> life ) <p>  --  Built-in speaker , microphone and voice recorder <p>  --  USB docking cradle <p>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion slot <p> E-mail Henry Norr at hnorr@sfgate.com.
