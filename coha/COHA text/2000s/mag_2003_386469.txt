Section : NASCAR <p> After years of painful second-place finishes , JACK ROUSH finally has his claws in the Cup . It 's testament to his competitiveness and eye for talent - and to a little feline fortune . <p> The sun long since has sunk behind Turns 1 and 2 at North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham , but the smiles still are shining on the faces of Matt Kenseth 's No. 17 team . <p> NASCAR inspectors hover around the engine in the postrace teardown . They poke , they prod , they measure . Crew chief Robbie Reiser and his men , including engine specialists Junior Paxton and Mike Messick , surround the scene , waiting anxiously . Kenseth has changed out of his driver 's uniform and joins his wife , Katie , and the team . <p> After his ceremonial postrace obligations , team owner Jack Roush enters the garage bay , shaking hands and receiving hugs along the way . The crew cracks jokes to break the tension . A NASCAR well-wisher drops by . " Congratulations , Jack , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although not official - just yet - it appears Roush Racing has won its first Winston Cup championship . Yes , maybe this time Roush will wake up in the morning to find out it is n't a dream - or a nightmare . All too often in the past , the nightmare has been the reality for this tenacious competitor . <p> Then Reiser receives the OK . No illegal spring . No carburetor spacer that does n't adhere to the rules in the little red book . Kenseth 's car has passed inspection . No , hell did not freeze over . Roush Racing will sit at the champion 's table at the awards banquet in December in New York . <p> Pinch Jack Roush . This championship is the real thing . <p> " I feel like I just crashed through a plate glass window , " Roush had said just after the race . " It 's been painful getting through it . " <p> And there have been soldiers in the Roush legions who have shared his pain . But no one knows how Roush has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I know the sacrifice , " Martin says . " I know what he sacrificed since 1987 , but he sacrificed a lot more than that before 1987 , when he started the 6 car . That story dates way back prior to that . It 's a good thing to see . It 's the American way . " <p> Roush 's story is not that different from the stories of many other speed demons in the garage . He came from humble beginnings and had to take several jobs to support his motorsports addiction . This man , who lives to find ways to make things go faster , began tinkering on engines while still in grade school . Roush eventually received a bachelor 's degree in mathematics and was recruited by Ford Motor Co. in 1964 . <p> Two years later , he helped found a group of fellow Ford gearheads called the Fastbacks . Picture A Beautiful Mind meets the NHRA . Over the next five years , Roush became more enticed by the performance end of the automotive industry . Though the job provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't provide the challenge or the creative outlet Roush craved . So Roush went out on his own in 1969 . <p> There was a brief stint at Chrysler the following year , but Roush already was laying the foundation for a mechanical think tank that one day would finance his racing jones . It did n't take long . In 1970 , he joined forces with Wayne Gapp and began a drag racing team . In the next five years , they won titles in the NHRA , IHRA and AHRA with their pro stock racer . Roush also found time to teach math and physics at Monroe ( Mich . ) Community College to automotive students . <p> Roush ended his partnership with Gapp in 1976 and created Jack Roush Performance engineering . His focus remained on building engines , and he won sports car championships in the next several years . <p> Perhaps Roush 's success in the other series made him believe the Winston Cup tide was an attainable goal when he entered the sport in 1987 . His initial timetable to win his first Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the No. 6 Ford during the 1988 season . <p> Roush hired Steve Hmiel and Robin Pemberton in 1987 to head up his operation , based in Liberty , N.C. Pemberton left in 1991 to work for Felix Sabates , but Hmiel , who currently is technical director for Dale Earnhardt Inc. , remained for the next 10 years , working as Martin 's crew chief . Hmiel also has felt Roush 's pain , coming close - so close - so many times with Martin . <p> So was Hmiel surprised that it took so long for Roush Racing to win the title ? " We already won one in 1990 , " Hmiel says , insistently . <p> That year , Martin won the second race of the season , at Richmond , but an inspection turned up a carburetor spacer that did not meet specifications , and the team was penalized 46 points . <p> " I 'll never forget ( NASCAR 's ) Les Richter when we left the trailer that night . It was dark and cold , and we thought we had won the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Do n't worry about it . Just win by more J than 46 points , ' and we lost by 26 . " <p> Not much consolation for a team that had all the tools and the driver to win . Which is why Hmiel says he 's surprised that it took Roush this long but even more surprised that it was n't Martin who won the title . <p> Hmiel says " the heartbreak of 1990 " emotionally damaged the team . <p> " Having lost it like that left such a scar on everyone , " Hmiel says . " It was such a heartbreaking deal that it took a long time to get rolling again . We deserved to win it . We had finished third the year before in just our second year together as a team , and it was growing . We were living off the momentum . Then the anxiety from that was unbelievable . From then on , we 've all struggled to understand it . " <p> In their 16 seasons together , Martin and Roush have amassed 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished in the top 10 in points 13 times . They have finished second four times . That includes 2002 , when they missed by just 38 points - after NASCAR docked Martin 25 points for using an illegal spring in the second Rockingham race . It 's no wonder the two have developed such a mutual respect for each other . <p> " Jack is a guy who would do anything in the world for me - and there 's not very many of those people around , " says Martin , who finished 17th points this season . " With my dad gone , there 's not very many people who have that special of a meaning to me . When you have that kind of relationship , you care deeply , and I care about how hard he has worked and his drive and determination . <p> " I know Jack . I know what he is made of , and I 'm really happy for him . I do n't think there was ever any question of whether it would happen for him . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time coming . I 'm really happy for him . " <p> Owner Roger Penske also has developed a deep admiration for Roush , who has built a five-car Winston Cup empire that also includes Greg Biffle , a former Busch and Craftsman Truck series champion ; Jeff Burton , who has 17 career Cup victories , and Kurt Busch , who has eight career victories , four this season . <p> " Jack is the ultimate businessman , " Penske says . " I think he 's put his heart and soul into NASCAR racing . I think technically , he 's the smartest team owner we have in the business today - not only strategically but fundamentally from the equipment . <p> " He 's been able to leverage his racing - as we have - into a business , and in Detroit today , Roush Industries is one of the key outfits that people want to do business with . " <p> Another gift that has added to Roush 's success is his ability to identify talent - whether behind the wheel or with the wrenches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feud with Roush that started with his late father and his car owner , Richard Childress , in the 1990s , he does n't underestimate Roush 's capabilities . <p> " I 'm not a big fan of Jack Roush , personally , " Earnhardt says . " He 's a hell of a competitor . I do n't really know him very well as a person , but I consider him one of my fierce rivals . <p> " My dad always had a tiff with Roush , and I definitely carried it over when I started racing . I do n't think he has too big of an opinion of me , and I 'm not sure I have that big of one of him . But I have to give him a lot of credit for what he 's been able to accomplish in this sport , and one of his biggest assets is his eye for talent . You ca n't deny what he 's been able to bring into the sport , and that makes him a successful car owner . " <p> Roush refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark 's find , " Roush says . " And Benny Parsons discovered Greg Biffle . We 've been lucky . " <p> Martin says : " I do n't think Jack looks so much for a driver 's talent ; he looks for the driver 's heart . He does n't just do that with drivers . He does that with people in general . He just has a handful of drivers , but he 's got thousands of people who work for him , and the ones he hand-picks , he picks from the heart . They have to have some talent , but a lot of times he 'll pass over the most talented and put someone in with the biggest heart . " <p> Roush is affectionately referred to as the " Cat in the Hat " for his signature straw hat . But considering the car accident he had in his younger years , a drag racing spill during his driving days and his near-fatal small plane crash in April 2002 , Roush already has exhausted several of his nine lives . <p> So how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Roush says . " But the next time I take my plane into a wire , I 'm going to make sure I have a bigger propeller . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Rouosh , NASCAR 's ' Cat in the Hat , ' surprisingly got his first Cup title with Kenseth , not longtime driver Martin , who has finished second in points four times . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : There were some apprehensive moments after Rockinaham. but Roush and the Kenseths eventually could smile . <p> By Lee Spencer <p> Driver reports <p> Lee Spencer looks at where the Roush drivers are headed in 2004 and beyond . Mark Martin <p> This long has been the flagship team of the Roush camp . Martin is signed through 2005 and will be with Roush until he decides to retire . In early November , Pat Tryson came on board as crew chief . With a fresh start and renewed enthusiasm , Martin should have no trouble returning to the top 10 in 2004 . Greg Bfflle <p> Roush Racing has given Biffle all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough . Teams already are bidding for the rights to Biffle in 2005 . Although he won titles for Roush in the truck and Busch series , Biffle 's status at Roush will have to be elevated if the organization hopes to retain him . Matt Kenseth <p> The last time a team won consecutive titles was 1997-98 , when Jeff Gordon 's did it . Though it 's not an impossible task , it 's hard for teams to keep up with technical advancements during a run to a championship . But this group is solid , and Kenseth has n't won his last title . Do you think the two pit crew guys who left in the offseason are kicking themselves about now ? Kurt Busch <p> He 's due for a comeback in 2004 . He learned what it 's like to come close to winning a title in 2002 but now has lost favor with the fans . This team needs to address its engine issues - five failures are unacceptable . At 25 , Busch still has a lot of raw talent and must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Roush in the future . Jeff Burton <p> Just when Burton and crew chief Paul Andrews started clicking , questions about sponsorship and rumors about Burton possibly leaving became distractions . At 36 , Burton has many good years ahead of him . If Roush can get maximum performance from his Fords , there should be no excuses . <p> The shape of Roush to come <p> With the new concessions coming for the Ford body and engine , the entire Roush operation is optimistic about its chances next year . <p> Five Cup teams are under the Roush Racing banner , and a technical partner , Wood Brothers , is moving its operations from Virginia to North Carolina to join those teams , so do n't expect the organization to expand its Cup side any time soon . But Roush is planning to run two Busch Series teams in 2004 : one super team with Mark Martin , Jeff Burton and Matt Kenseth sharing driving duties , and another team with Greg Biffle running all but one race . <p> It 's very possible that Carl Edwards , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next Roush Racing driver to enter Nextel Cup competition , as a replacement or addition . Teammate Jon Wood inevitably will take over Wood Brothers No. 21 Ford , now driven by Ricky Rudd . - L.S. <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Edwards <p>
