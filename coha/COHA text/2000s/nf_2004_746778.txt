1 . Introduction : Aesthetic Illusion as Reception Phenomenon and as a Problem for Narratology <p> " THE CORRECTIONS is the whole package . You will laugh , wince , groan , weep . and be reminded of why you read serious fiction in the first place . " This is one of the blurb advertisements of Jonathan Franzen 's bestseller The Corrections ( 2001 ) , praise which is basically an elaboration of the frequently-used publicity formula " a moving fiction . " We are all familiar with both such promises of " pleasures that . fiction affords " ( cover of The Corrections ) and with the pleasures themselves , indeed so familiar that we rarely enquire into the state of mind that renders such responses to fiction possible . Such reactions indicate a deep emotional involvement  --  usually an empathy with central characters  --  and . unless we suffer from a delusion , they presuppose aesthetic illusion : a feeling of being recentered in a possible world as if it were ( a slice of ) life , a feeling that prevails in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this impression is triggered by a " mere " artefact . <p> Aesthetic illusion is an attractive effect of the reading process and a common reception phenomenon . In contemporary culture it can be encountered as a response to a plethora of traditional as well as new media , such as the visual arts , the theater , opera , comics , radio drama , film and computer-created virtual realities ( provided the recipient maintains some distance ) , and one must not forget fiction , which continues to have an important share in the illusion-creating media . Curiously , while the cultural presence of aesthetic illusion is quite massive , it has received only modest attention in recent research . The most influential and best study in English is still Ernst Gombrich 's Art and Illusion ( 1960 ) . while the first major collective volume in English dedicated to literary illusionism consists of the proceedings of a conference held fifteen years ago ( Burwick and Pape ) . One should also mention the possible-worlds research of Marie-Laure Ryan ( Possible Worlds ) , who. instead of " aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and " immersion " ( 22 ) . German narratology has produced several pioneering studies on aesthetic illusion as an effect of fiction . Werner Strube 's unpublished dissertation deserves to be mentioned here , as well as the book publications by Eckhard Lobsien and Manfred Smuda. ( n1 ) In my own monograph Asthetische Illusion I was able to draw upon all of these studies . This book and the critical response it has elicited , as well as my other studies on aesthetic illusionism in Shakespeare , lyric poetry , and twentieth-century fiction form the basis of the present essay . <p> On closer inspection , the hesitation of contemporary literary scholars in engaging in a discussion of aesthetic illusion is understandable , for it is a particularly elusive and hence problematic phenomenon : strictly speaking , it is a reception phenomenon located in the recipient 's mind , and what goes on there is actually beyond the scope of philology . Therefore there are serious methodological limitations to any purely philological theory of aesthetic illusion  --  including the present one . Yet this does not mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from introspection  --  which may , of course , be highly flawed , but can at least provide some clues as to which devices trigger asthetic illusion and to what degree  --  the principal means are reception testimonies by others . These include evidence from aestheticians and their theories from Aristotle 's Poetics onwards , besides comments on reception experiences by the general recipient , and last , but not least , clues deducible from the texts themselves . Such clues are particularly relevant if they play with the expectation of aesthetic illusion and undermine it , notably through self-reflexive metadevices . Although neither textual clues nor readers ' testimonies can yield reliable and detailed information on mental processes , such evidence can at least indicate the presence or absence of aesthetic illusion in certain cases ; besides , in contrast to the findings of neuropsychology , cognition research , and empirical literary studies , it can also shed light on the past . <p> Starting from such evidence , statements can be made concerning individual texts , text groups , periods , and cultural contexts in which aesthetic illusion appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity or frequency . Such a survey then permits us to select a corpus of typically illusionist texts , which in turn enables the theorist to describe the factors and conditions that are involved in the emergence of aesthetic illusion . This corpus moreover highlights typical features that recur in illusionist works and furnishes a basis from which to deduce underlying principles that contribute to the production of these features . The elucidation of such general features and principles will be the main focus of what follows . As a preliminary part of my presentation , I will , however , first describe the nature , properties , and variants of aesthetic illusion as opposed to various states of delusion , and will then proceed to discuss the factors that contribute to the emergence of aesthetic illusion . After this , four typical features of illusionist works shall be detailed , followed by an analysis of six basic " principles of illusion-making " that inform such works and contribute to their illusionist effect . To conclude this essay I will remark on some of the functions of aesthetic illusion in literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corollary , i.e. , the breaking of illusion . I close with some desiderata for further research . <p> Two caveats apply , though . The first refers to the schematic and theoretical nature of the following remarks : aesthetic illusion is too complex a subject to be treated here in more than a cursory way . As the history of illusionism will have to be excluded , and as only very few examples can be given , I will illustrate some points by referring to just one well-known short short story : Julio Cortzar 's " " Continuidad de los parques " ( 1956 cited in online translation ) . This frame tale is actually a metafictional demonstration of the workings of aesthetic illusion and leads to an ambivalent result , as it elicits such illusion within the fictional world and , to a certain extent , also in the real reader , but eventually lays it bare as a problematic , perhaps even dangerous effect . The second caveat refers to possible extensions of my theses . I would welcome it if my description of aesthetic illusion were applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical periods other than the ones focused on in this contribution . However , although other genres and media arc not excluded in principle , I will limit the scope of the present narratological essay to fiction published in the Western world since the seventeenth century , for it is from this period onwards that testimonies of the existence of aesthetic illusion can be observed with some frequency . 2 . What is " Aesthetic Illusion " ? <p> As a start , the concept of aesthetic illusion should be clarified beyond the provisional definition given above . So what is aesthetic illusion . ' Most theoreticians and testimonies point to the following constituents  --  most of which are also illustrated in the frame of Cortzar 's " Continuity of Parks , " in which a fictitious reader is shown in the grip of intense aesthetic illusion . <p> A. Aesthetic illusion is a mental state triggered by concrete objects or " artefacts " such as texts , performances , artworks , etc . ( For Cortzar 's diegetic reader , it is a novel about a man who entertains an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , sets out to kill her husband . ) This mental state emerges during a process of reception but is not always limited to it , as " after-images " may linger on for a while . ( Cortzar 's story relies on such an effect , as its terminal metalepsis , the paradoxical suggestion that the diegetic reader is killed by the hero of the hypodiegctic novel the reader is about to finish , is not actually narrated but exists only in the real recipient 's imagination after he has read the last words of the story . ) Since it depends on external illusionist objects , aesthetic illusion differs from hallucination , which emerges without such objects . <p> B. On the other hand , aesthetic illusion shares with hallucinations ( and also dreams ) a vivid impression that can be described as a feeling of being " recentered " or " immersed " in an imaginative possible world ( cf. Ryan , Possible Worlds 21-22 ) . This means that one does not just watch this world from a distance but has the impression of being present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way similar to that in which one experiences life . ( Cortzar 's reader feels that he is " witness " to what is going on in the story . ) Aesthetic illusion thus has an essentially experiential quality ( n2 ) and is moreover dependent on the " verisimilitude " or probability of the possible world . <p> C. As opposed to hallucination and other illusionlike states , the experience elicited by aesthetic illusion has a characteristic " as-if " quality : the illusion producing object creates a feeling of verisimilar lifelikeness , but not of life tout court . In fact , immersion , in aesthetic illusion , is never total . This is why aesthetic illusion is fundamentally a bipolar phenomenon : a dominant experiential immersion is always counterbalanced by a latent , culturally acquired awareness of the , fictionality of the perceived possible world ( objects ) . This ambivalence is also expressed by the collocation " aesthetic illusion " itself , in which " illusion , " strictly speaking , refers to immersion , and " aesthetic " to the distance that is essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This distance is well expressed in Cortzar 's story . While the diegetic reader " disengages himself line by line from the things around him , " he yet " at the same time feel ( s his head rest comfortably on the green velvet of the chair " and thus  --  at least in the initial stage of reception  --  remains conscious of his being ( also ) centered in a real-life situation . <p> For systematic reasons , and also in the face of repeated criticism of illusionist art and illusionism in the media ( attacks that usually rest on a confusion of " aesthetic illusion " with " delusion " ) , it is crucial to emphasize two things . On the one hand , aesthetic illusion ( " poetic faith " ) is a " willing suspension of disbelief " ( Coleridge 169 ) ; characteristically , Cortzar 's reader " lets himself be absorbed " ( my emphasis ) . On the other hand , rational distance is a necessary constituent of it . Thanks to this distance , an " aesthetic illusion " is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Moreover , the conjunction of distance and willful immersion distinguishes aesthetic illusion from related states in real life as well as from some artefact-induced states of mind . Such related states in real life include " illusions " and " delusions " as misconceptions ( cognitive errors ) and also several experiential states : sensory misperceptions. hallucinations , dreams , and the like . These states differ from aesthetic illusion in that they are entered upon involuntarily and lack the required distance between the experiencer and the fictional world . As for related , artefact-induced " delusionary " states that are equally nonaesthetic because they are involuntary and nondistanced , there is , first , a nonexperiential , " referential illusion " ( or " delusion " ) in the sense of an erroneous attribution of a reality status to something fictional or invented . In the visual arts , such referential mistakes are sometimes playfully caused by trompel'oeil techniques , in literature , by " fictions of authenticity " or by particularly convincing imitations of factual texts . A second , artefact-induced delusion frequently occurs parallel to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely an experiential delusion without distance . This state , according to Oliver Grau 's critical analysis , is the ultimate aim of the development of ever more sophisticated strategies of total immersion , the most advanced form of which to date is that of computerized virtual realities . Yet , even simple artefacts can produce similar delusions under certain circumstances , as Cervantes illustrates in an amusing metafictional scene of Don Quixote ( Part 2. ch. 26 ) , where Don Quixote is so overwhelmed by an injustice represented in a puppet show that he smashes the puppets in anger . As this example shows , an experiential delusion is a condition in which a recipient is so much in the grip of a possible world that he may even feel compelled to interfere with it and experiences it not as if it were life but as ( a slice of ) life. ( n3 ) <p> When either of these artefact-induced delusions is combined with a latent distance , it becomes a variant of aesthetic illusion : There is , first , the center of aesthetic illusion , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Don Quixote 's exaggerated reaction is ridiculous because it mimics aesthetic illusion in its most characteristic component , experiential immersion , but lacks its other component , aesthetic distance . In this Don Quixote resembles Cortazar 's diegetic reader , who in the latter part of his reception also increasingly forgets about the distance be initially felt and apparently applies what he is just reading to himself . <p> The episode from Don Quixote also exemplifies a distorted form of a second , albeit subsidiary variant of aesthetic illusion : " referential ( pseudo- ) illusion . " This is a state in which the recipient indulges in the idea that an artefact may render reality  --  without , however , being entirely convinced of it , as Don Quixote unfortunately is . The secondary , optional status of this " referential pseudoillusion " can be seen in science fiction : SF texts can also create aesthetic illusion , but if they do . this illusion is of an experiential nature only ( since the genre excludes a real-life reference ) . ( n4 ) Unless otherwise stated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tout court will therefore be used from now on to designate this main , experiential variant . The relative position of aesthetic illusion ( and its two variants ) as opposed to related phenomena in the realm of real-life as well as artefact-induced " illusions " and illusionlike states is illustrated in figure 1 . <p> D. In the main , the experiential form of aesthetic illusion and the degree to which its constituents , immersion and distance are realized are not stable but can vary historically , individually and even during the reception of one and the same artefact . ( The real readers of Cortzar 's story are meant to experience aesthetic illusion for a while , but also , at least at the end , to disengage themselves from it , namely when becoming aware of the textual strategy that has led them into the trap of the suggested metalepsis . ) Aesthetic illusion may thus be represented as being located on a scale between the two poles of immersion and distance , maintaining , however , a relative proximity to " immersion . " The poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immersion do not yet , or no longer , qualify as aesthetic illusion . <p> E. As in the blurbs for The Corrections quoted above , the quasi-experience of ( a ) reality that is typical of aesthetic illusion is frequently described in ( mostly pleasurable ) emotional terms ( Cortzar 's narrator speaks of a " perverse pleasure , " which the diegetic reader feels during the reception process ) . This points to the fact that the dominant part of this kind of " illusion " is inextricably linked to the recipient 's emotions . It is thus no coincidence that the first characterization of the hypodicgetic novel in Cortzar 's text , " the sordid dilemma of the hero and heroine . " is an evaluative and emotional one . On account of this quality , aesthetic illusion differs notably from the reader 's residual awareness of fictionality , which is rational , but also from a scholarly approach to a work of art in which its structures , themes , and meanings are analyzed . The rational distance implied in aesthetic illusion is not , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent : for it is mainly responsible for the paradox that during the operation of aesthetic illusion even unpleasant emotions such as fear and horror can be experienced as pleasurable . <p> F. As for further specifications of the nature of aesthetic illusion in fiction , the following can be gathered from most statements of relevant experiences : for an illusionist entering into the worlds provided by artefacts , these worlds appear to have a quasi-sensory quality . Owing to the paramount importance of visual perception in most human beings , visual " imagination " here seems to predominate . ( Cortzar 's reader testifies to this , when his mental " images . take on color and movement . " ) Other sensory experiences , in particular aural " imaginings " of voices , noises , and music , can also play a role . <p> Summarizing what we have said so far , but in part anticipating the ensuing argument , the following general definition of aesthetic illusion can be given : aesthetic illusion is a pleasurable mental state that emerges during the reception of an artefact ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunction of factors that , as will be detailed below , are located in the artefact ( performance ) itself , in the recipient , and in certain cultural and historical contexts . This mental state consists in an impression of variable intensity , of being imaginatively immersed in a possible world that is constituted , or referred to , by the artefact , and of experiencing this world in a mainly sensory ( visual ) and emotional way as if it were a slice of life . In spite of a dominant and willed feeling of experiential immersion , aesthetic illusion , as opposed to delusion , is characterized by a latent rational distance . This distance is a consequence of the culturally acquired awareness of the fictional quality of the artefact ( performance ) and of the illusionary status of the dominant effect induced by it . <p> The " narrative illusion " elicited by fiction , which is our focus here , ( n5 ) is a special case of aesthetic illusion and must be further specified . The first , obvious modification is its being induced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Continuity of Parks , " by the written text of a fictional narrative , but oral transmission also plays a role . As a rule , both variants of storytelling exclusively use the symbolic medium of language and to this extent differ from iconic media , such as the visual arts , dramatic performances , and film . The apparent directness of an illusion-inducing presence in the iconic media  --  and a privileging of the model of dramatic illusion  --  has led some critics into misconceptions about narrative illusion . Murray Krieger , for instance , has it that " before we can , through make-believe , be referred to any possible ' real world ' out there , " the primary object of narrative illusion is what he calls a " shadow genre " : " the apparently factual or referential sort of text that . the novel is making-believe it is " such as historiography , real-life autobiography , etc. ( 309 ) . This sadly underrates the power of experiential immersion in fiction and erroneously implies that narrative illusion is necessarily dependent on referential illusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some justification in the period of the " rise of the novel , " this " lure " has lost its importance after the novel had been established as a genre in its own right. ( n6 ) <p> The second specification of narrative illusion is linked to a second confusion about its nature . It has recently arisen in German criticism . I have in mind Ansgar Nunning 's contention that the " primary illusion " of fiction is centered not on the story , and hence on the ( intra ) diegetic level , but on the communicational scenario of the extradiegetic narrator ( see ' " Great Wits " ' 69-73. and " Mimesis " 19-20 ) . While I do not deny that there is such a thing as an Erzhlillusion ( the illusion of a narratorial presence ) in some cases , e.g. , in Tristram Shandy , I strongly object to its alleged centrality or primacy in typically illusionist fiction . Nnning 's proposal not only testifies to a problematic privileging of the iconic representation of voice over the symbolic representation of characters and action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we tend to remember , even of stories transmitted by an overt , " authorial " or first-person narator , is mostly the story , and not the narrator  --  precisely because it was the storyworld that had us in its grip . In addition , dismissing the storyworld as the principal object of narrative illusion  --  and the center of narrativity  --  would create unnecessary problems about narratives with covert narrators , as encountered in Cortzar 's story ( which would then have to be seen as eliciting only a weaker , secondary kind of illusion ? ) . Denying the primacy of the story-centered illusion would also dissociate novels from films and other narrative media in a problematic way , and would require us to assume a transferal of the focus of aesthetic illusion in cases of intermedial transpositions , e.g. , from novel to film . <p> There is yet another reason why the narrator can not be the principal object of illusion : independently of his or her potential lifelikeness. the narrator is always a transmitting agency , an element of discourse . The lifelike quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only from a certain correspondence between the " inventory " of illusionist possible worlds and real-life objects and concepts , but also from a fundamental analogy between the experience induced by illusionist artefacts and the basic concepts and schemata that guide the perception and experience of reality ( I have called this the illusionist " analogy thesis " ) . ( n7 ) Among the conditions of real-life experience there is the " natural " belief that we perceive reality in an unmediated ( and , we love to assume , undistorted ) way  --  that is , we bracket the actual mediacy of all perception . Accordingly , aesthetic illusion , whether narrative or not , also implies the feeling of being present in the possible world in a " natural . " unmediated way . This is indeed corroborated by the impression that Cortzar 's diegetic reader has of being a " witness " of the storyworld . In fact , during an illusionist reading , the actual mediation through the level of discourse is mostly disregarded , and we appear to ' witness ' the storyworld as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even , albeit paradoxically , independently of it. ( n8 ) hence with a feeling of " immediacy . " <p> The third specification of narrative illusion refers to the narrativity of the texts under consideration and highlights the importance of a dynamic experience of time and change . The dynamic quality of fiction-induced aesthetic illusion also implies a specification of its center . Aesthetic illusion is typically centered on the following two constituents of histoire : action and characters ( that is : characters in action , whether in " outer " or " inner . " psychological action ) . In contrast to this , " descriptive . " static elements such as settings or characters ' looks  --  although these also play a role in the creation , and in particular intensification , of narrative illusion  --  are only of secondary importance . 3 . Factors Contributing to Aesthetic Illusion <p> As mentioned before , aesthetic illusion  --  including its narrative variant  --  is a phenomenon , or , as Herbert Grabes ( cf. 408 , 428 ) has rightly emphasized , a process that is produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributing to a " guided projection " ( Gombrich 169 ) . The projection takes place in the mind of the recipient , yet in the state of aesthetic illusion this mind 's activity is not free-floating but " guided " by the illusionist artefact , and both the recipient and the artefact are influenced in turn by contexts which also contribute to the projection . The following factors therefore need to be taken into account ( all of which are also present in Cortzar 's story ) : <p> a. the recipient ( the " projector " of illusion ) ; <p> b. the artefact ( the guiding " script " ) , and , in some cases  --  which , however , do not include the typical reception of fiction-its performance ( the mise en scne of the " script " ) ; <p> c. cultural and historical contexts and reception conditions ( the " room " in which the script is originally located and where the guided projection takes place ) . <p> As for the cultural and historical contexts , we must always assume a plurality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reader are contemporary and part of the same culture ) . This has noteworthy consequences : The effect of aesthetic illusion may be conceived of . as already mentioned , as produced by a relative correspondence or analogy between , on the one hand , the artefact , its content and structure , and . on the other hand , essential concepts and experiential contents , contextual elements that influence both the author and the recipient and regulate the operations of verisimilitude as a prime condition of aesthetic illusionism . Since there is no " natural , " universally valid perception and experience of reality , let alone worldview , differences between the contexts of production and reception can substantially affect the emergence of aesthetic illusion . Hence verisimilitude  --  and with it aesthetic illusionism  --  are to a considerable extent historically and culturally variable . As a result , the same work or similar techniques of representation can change in their illusionist valeur according to temporal and spatial parameters . Another , equally variable contextual factor that influences aesthetic illusion can be located in the set of frames that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a given period . For instance , the question is crucial to what extent aesthetic illusionism and an aesthetic approach to artworks including aesthetic distance are practiced or known in a given culture or period ( for " Continuity of Parks " this is clearly the case ) or whether a " magical " approach is predominant and certain artefacts are regarded as numinous realities . Such frames also include generic conventions . The miniature novel read in Cortzar 's story , for instance , is clearly a criminal love-story , and the existence of this schema permits Cortzar to outline the narrative in no more than a few words . The dependence of aesthetic illusionism on contextual factors can be illustrated by texts in which supernatural agencies appear . These will have different effects , according to the acceptability of such appearances within the cultural framework relevant to the reader ( or which he is willing to grant the text ) and according to generic frames ( e.g. , the applicability of the conventions of Gothic fiction to a given text ) . <p> Even more variable than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A recipient 's illusionist response is not only subject to external , contextual circumstances but is also heavily dependent on individual factors such as his or her range of experience , age , gender , interests , cultural background , and ability to " read " works of art aesthetically . The illusionist response further depends on the reception conditions , e. g. , whether a novel is read for the first time or not , and , last but not least , on the recipient 's willingness  --  clearly given in Cortzar 's reader  --  to become immersed in an illusionist reception . <p> Due to these variables it is difficult , if not impossible , to decide on the actual illusionist effect of a given work , text , artistic technique , etc. for all periods and for all individuals . However , this does not mean that nothing at all can be said about the factor " artefact " or text  --  on condition that one accept a ceteris paribus approach . Such a procedure is acceptable in particular if one limits the contextual scope to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western culture ( where the evolution of aesthetic verisimilitude and the responses to illusionist artefacts are fairly well documented ) . Moreover , one needs to reduce the variability of individual recipients by means of the theoretical construct of an " average recipient " who is able and prepared to " willingly suspend his/her disbelief in the reception process , but is distanced enough not to become the victim of an experiential or referential delusion . <p> If context , reception conditions , and the recipient are problematic variables , this does not seem to the same degree to be the case for the artefact , performance or " work "  --  provided , of course , that one does not subscribe to the Barthesian rejection of the notion of the " work " as a readymade construct and agrees that , where aesthetic illusion occurs , it is to a considerable extent the " work " that guides the illusionist projection . This at least is a practical assumption ( which is also corroborated by Cortzar 's story ) and enables narratology to contribute to a theory of aesthetic illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " work " permits the description of typical features and devices of illusionist texts but also of the formal principles that inform them , their structure and make-up , and this procedure also allows the critic to highlight some techniques and devices that are frequently used in illusionist texts . <p> Such descriptions , which form the backbone of a " text-centered " theory of literary illusion ( as part of a larger theory that still needs to be developed ) , can be derived from a huge corpus of primary works which encompass several centuries of Western history , works that have been , and to some extent still are , read as more or less illusionist  --  in contrast to others ( such as radically experimental postmodernist fictions ) which thwart an illusionist access . It is with this illusionist corpus and its features in mind that one can indeed say something about the illusionist potential of a given literary text or genre , for no more can be claimed , on account of the aforementioned variables . In fact , if in the following the terms " features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusionist devices " are used , it is with the proviso that they are not meant to be textual essences with fixed effects in the framework of a prescriptive theory . Rather , such entities should be regarded  --  to borrow from Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan 's " post-classical " rethinking of structuralist narratology  --  as elements of " implied reading potentials informing the interaction between reader and text , between interpretive communities and text , between a culture 's encoded ideology and a reader 's compliant or resistant decoding " ( 145 ) . With this proviso , the corpus of illusionist fiction moreover permits one to select a prototype with a particularly high degree of illusionist " reading potential . " 4 . Typical Features of Illusionist Fiction and the Principles of Illusion-Making in Fiction <p> In the history of fiction , the illusionist prototype of the past few centuries appears to be the nineteenth-century realist novel , which has always been accorded a particularly high potential for eliciting illusionist immersion . Realist novels in fact manage to draw readers quite easily into their worlds , and they keep the readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of verisimilitude and experientiality while minimizing aesthetic distance . On the basis of realist texts it is therefore possible to isolate illusion-inducing textual features which can then be linked to principles of fictional illusion-making and specific narrative devices . <p> In narratological terms , typically illusionist novels of realism , such as George Eliot 's Adam Bede or Hardy 's Tess of the d'Urbervilles , display the following features : their story level is the central text level , their storyworlds have a certain extension and complexity , arc consistent and lifelike in their inventory and generally correspond to the reader 's expectations of a narrative ; their level of discourse is comparatively inconspicuous , serving mainly to transmit the storyworlds and to support their consistency and lifelikeness ; story and discourse show a remarkable tendency towards seriousness ; the texts are predominantly heteroreferential . <p> As not all of these traits are self-explanatory , some comments are in order . The centrality of the story level , which can also be observed in Cortzar 's text , correlates with what has been said about the principal object of illusionist immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm on which the immersive potential and the experientiality of illusionist texts tend to be focused . <p> Illusionist worlds typically have a certain extension , because aesthetic illusion emerges during a process , the process of transition from normal perception to aesthetic , illusionist reception . If this process is too short , because the text is too brief , immersion will not so easily take place . ( " Continuity of Parks , " which extends over only one page and half , is here for once atypical ! ) <p> The same argument also accounts for the relative complexity of most illusionist worlds ( again a feature that Cortzar 's story , owing to its shortness , does not possess ) . Although , at first glance , this may be regarded as a special feature of realist fiction only , further analysis reveals that complexity is a feature that ties in with the general quality of aesthetic illusionism , namely that of recentering the recipient in a possible world , whose quality as " world " is enhanced by both extension and complexity . <p> The consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more general quality of illusionist possible worlds , namely their accessibility . Possible worlds can be more or less accessible and provide different types of accessibility ( cf. Ryan , Narrative 32-33 ) . It is clear that an enhanced accessibility facilitates illusionist immersion , and this is why illusionist works tend to lower the threshold of access as much as possible and even " lure " their readers into their worlds . In realism , this tendency shows in the presentation of fictional worlds that generally seem to be an extension of the recipients ' real world in terms of spatial , temporal ( contemporary ) , and social settings but also , e.g. , in terms of norms , ideals , and epistemological preconceptions about the " readability " of reality . In " Continuity of Parks " this " continuity " between the situation in which the reading process takes place and ( part of ) the hypodiegetic story is even emphasized in the title . <p> The basic conformity of illusionist possible worlds to the frame " narrative " means that these worlds possess not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimension , as they are organized around a dynamic story which forms their backbone ( as again epitomized by Cortzar 's text ) . <p> The relative inconspicuousness of the level of discourse can be illustrated in " Continuity of Parks . " with reference to the embedded story , by the fact that it is recounted as a straightforward narrative ( the summary-like style of the first part of the text underlines this impression ) . The unobtrusiveness of the discourse forms a counterpart to the centrality of the storyworld and is related to the nature of illusionist immersion , which is to predominate over aesthetic distance . It is therefore understandable that typically illusionist works  --  white not suppressing them entirely  --  tend to keep distancing elements to a minimum . <p> The scarcity of distancing elements in typically illusionist works can be seen in their tendency to avoid highlighting the mediacy or fictionality of the artefact ( Cortzar 's story deviates from this feature , owing to its metafictionaliy ) . The shunning of distance can moreover be witnessed in a no less typical illusionist trend , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated by the seriousness of Cortzar 's story , which appears to culminate in a murder ) . Both facets can be observed with particular clarity in realist novels : while they do not totally eschew strategies such as metafictional self-referentiality , they always maintain a predominant heteroreferentiality ; and in spite of a certain humor , for example in Dickens 's storytelling , comedy in realism never reaches the point of carnivalesque hilariousness and subversiveness , as it does in Tristram Shandy for example . Carnivalesque laughter , as described by Mikhail Bakhtin , is in fact to a large extent antagonistic to illusionist immersion for two reasons . Owing to their tendency to establish a subversive community without hierarchical differences ( " familiarization " ) , carnivalesque topsy-turvy worlds frequently disregard thresholds , including , in comic texts , the threshold between the real and the fictional world ( e.g. , in metalepses or the parabasis of comedy ) . Such " impossible " blurrings highlight the fictionality of the comic world and thus create distance from it . Secondly , distance from comic objects is also implied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anesthsie momentane du coeur ( Bergson 4 ) . Aesthetic illusion , on the contrary , has an affinity with emotional involvement , and this in turn correlates with seriousness , as can also be seen in drama . Tragedies tend towards aesthetic illusionism ( Aristotle 's " catharsis " in fact presupposes it to a large extent ) , while comedies frequently have a propensity towards the breaking of illusion . <p> The predominant heteroreferentiality of realist fiction is actually a consequence of the more general fact that all illusionist artefacts , even those that ultimately play with illusion , like Cortzar 's story , are representational ( n9 ) : they evoke or " represent " a world that is seemingly outside the artefact , which therefore appears to refer to something other than itself ( and thus is " heteroreferential " ) . As a special , historical kind of mimesis , the realistic novel is in fact strongly heteroreferential . Yet this does not mean that mimesis alone guarantees aesthetic illusion . Other features , as will be noted in the following , also contribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all illusionist texts must be either realistic ( they can also be , e.g .. modernist ) or mimetic in the sense of imitating ( slices of reality . ( As opposed to such " imitation , " fantasy fiction can be illusionist , too . ) The relationship between aesthetic illusion , mimesis , and realism is schematically represented in figure 2 . <p> The basic features of illusionist fiction can further be linked to some general principles of illusion-making that give rise to them . It should be noted , though , that the nature of aesthetic illusion as a gradable effect , which is frequently the result of a subtle balance between sometimes conflicting textual factors , tolerates certain deviations from prolotypically illusionist model-texts , and that therefore in individual cases not all of these principles will be traceable to the same degree . In addition , owing to the other , extratextual factors involved in the emergence of aesthetic illusionism , these principles should only be regarded as tendencies that enhance the potential for aesthetic illusion but can not guarantee its realization . Nevertheless , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the description of individual illusionist texts but also historically , for they appear to motivate certain developments in the history of fiction . Up to the beginning of the twentieth century ( including some facets of modernism ) , this history can be described in a formula coined by Gombrich for the visual arts : it is a " progress from rude beginnings to the perfection of illusion " ( 4 ) . The general direction of this " progress , " namely the development of ever more persuasive narrative devices , is perhaps explicable without recourse to these principles , for it was probably motivated by the necessity of supplementing old techniques that may have lost their original force. ( n10 ) Yet the details of this development , e.g. , concerning the evolution of narrative perspective , may be accounted for by an ever closer observation of the principles introduced below , whose persuasiveness arguably derives from their relation to real-life perception . ( This would , however , also mean that for the recipients of different epochs different degrees in the realization of these principles may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I propose six general principles of illusion-making in literary fiction . The first four of these shape the material of an illusionist possible world , its coherence and presentation in general ; the other two inform the particular , persuasive " rhetoricity " of illusionist texts . Principle One : The access-and immersion-facilitating construction of the possible world 's inventory <p> The representationality of illusionist fiction is due to the application of a principle whose most basic purpose is to offer the recipients some concrete " building blocks " as material for the possible world in which they can recenter themselves in their imagination ( a mere argument consisting of abstract notions would not suffice ) . In Seymour Chatman 's terminology these " building blocks " are " story-existents " ( 107 ) and " events " ( 43 ) , that is , setting and anthropomorphic actants ( i.e .. characters ) , and their experiences . <p> Yet this is not sufficient , as such story material only fulfills elementary conditions of narratives , regardless of their illusionist potential . In fact the principle under discussion does more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it monitors a construction of the inventory of the possible world that allows an easy accessibility to it and creates a life like impression of " fullness . " <p> One of the effects of this principle is. for instance , the furnishing of possible worlds with objects ( locales , institutions , public persons , contemporary events , etc. ) that are well-known to the reader . ( This feature is instantiated to an extreme , perhaps ironic extent by " Continuity of Parks , " as the house into which the hypodiegetic murderer creeps curiously resembles the very building in which the diegetic reader lives . ) <p> Another of its effects relates to the amount of detail with which the illusionist universe is equipped . Strongly illusionist narratives typically do not merely sketch a possible world but in analogy to the wealth of details perceived in everyday life , show a tendency towards imitating this wealth , thereby reducing the indeterminacies that to some extent occur in all representation . This " fleshing out " of the " bones " of the story is realized by providing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , characters , experiences , or events . Sufer descriptions facilitate readerly immersion and frequently create memorable " scenes . " ( n11 ) Since the eighteenth century the tendency towards descriptive visualization in illusionist fiction which is discernible both in the frame and the framed story of Cortzar 's extremely condensed " Continuity of Parks . " was supported ( and even propelled ) by an increasingly visual culture that relied more and more on the empirical , outer appearance of things and produced a growing mass of pictures . <p> The illusionist principle under discussion thus provides the inventories for fictional worlds ; It does so in an illusion-friendly way that facilitates access to them . It is due to this principle 's " access-and immersion-facilitating construction of the possible worlds ' inventories " that the center of illusionist fictions is " visibly " the level of the " story " rather than the level of the " discourse " and that illusionist stories are characterized by a predominance of fictional ( hetero ) referentiality over self-referentiality . This referentiality can point to possible worlds of outer " reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of inner , psychological " reality " ( as in the more " subjective " illusion created by modernist interior monologue or stream-of-consciousness fiction ) . Principle Two : The consistency of the possible world <p> Illusionist narratives enhance the probability of their worlds by linking their inventories in a particular way . Although possible worlds could theoretically be constructed on the basis of all sorts of rules , illusionist worlds tend to be informed , at least in fundamental , logical and epistemological respects , by rules that are compatible , or identical , with the rules governing real life . Thus the overall tendency is to ensure a fundamental analogy between the experience of the illusionist world and the perception of the real world . This means that illusionist worlds are internally coherent and meet basic expectations of meaningfulness that also apply to real-life experience , e.g. , concerning the absence of unresolvable contradictions , the consistency of time and place , causality , teleology , the difference between reality and fiction , etc . This internal coherence and external compatibility is regulated by the " principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaleptic ending , this principle also applies to " Continuity of Parks . " <p> One must , however , acknowledge that the principle of consistency is not so strict as not to tolerate certain deviations of the rules governing illusionist worlds from those of the actual one . Consistency operates according to Ryan 's " principle of minimal departure " ( Narrrative 51 ) : it is a default option . Departures are possible , and can even remain compatible with illusion , provided they are marked and explained or linked , e.g. , to generic conventions and thus obtain a secondary kind of plausibility . Neither does the internal coherence of illusionist worlds rule out all obscurities  --  as long as these can be clarified by links between the " deficient " areas and neighboring more coherent ones ( e.g. , the seemingly inconsistent behavior of a character may be explicable with reference to a certain situation clarified afterwards ) . Historically , the principle of consistency can be seen in operation in the fact that most illusionist works tend to avoid deficiencies in coherence and are characterized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their discourse , since it is this transparency which permits the recipient 's attention to focus , in a relatively " easy reception . " on the story rather than on the discourse . Of course , " transparency " does not imply an " absence " of discourse ( an impossibility anyway ) . The discourse in illusionist works can even be quite elaborate ( e.g. , in the handling of discourse-time ) , as long as it does not foreground this elaborateness , as will be seen in the following . An important factor in the creation of consistency is the figure of the narrator , in particular the authorial , " omniscient " narrator . Principle Three : Perspectivity <p> The experientiality and probability of illusionist texts are the result also of other principles . One of these is the principle of perspectivity . In fact , one of the most characteristic hallmarks of the history of illusionism ( both in painting and literature ) has been the development and perfection of techniques that imitate the perspectivity of everday experience , that is , the inevitable limitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the perceiver. ( n12 ) In Western fiction this development results in the increasing use of internal focalization since the eighteenth-century first-person epistolary novels and later in modernist third-person " figural narration , " where the " subjectivity " of the internal focalizer gradually supersedes the " objectivity " of an overt narrator and enhances the illusionist effect of " immediacy , " Immediacy is an efficient trigger of aesthetic illusion . In " Continuity of Parks , " this effect is admirably exploited by the dominant internal perspective , which allows both the fictitious reader and ourselves to follow the hypodiegetic murderer on his way to his victim . On the other hand  --  and this is an example of the fact that aesthetic illusion is indeed the result of a balance between textual factors  --  the near-elimination of an overt narrator can also generate problems with textual coherence ; the principle of perspectivity can thus come into conflict with the principle of consistency . Principle Four : Respecting and exploiting the potential of the medium and the genre employed <p> The fact that illusionist narratives ( as opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain extension and possess a relatively inconspicuous discourse , and that they moreover do not principally consist of descriptions , is the result of a fourth principle : that of respecting and exploiting the potential of the medium and the chosen genre . The generic facet of this principle can be explained by the circumstance that surprising departures from generic conventions would foreground these conventions as such and would therefore shift the reader 's attention from the possible world as the center of aesthetic illusion to the conditions of its construction . As regards the respecting of the medium , the workings of this principle can be described as follows . Since literature , in contrast to the visual arts , primarily unfolds in time , it is conducive to the creation and perpetuation of aesthetic illusion to respect this " natural " condition of the medium by taking the time-aspect of reception into account . This implies that literary texts have to allow for a gradual building up of illusionist worlds ( a fact that is acknowledged by Cortzar 's having his hero " disengage himself line by line from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illusion over a more or less extended period of time and length of text . The operation of this medium-related principle can also be observed where both fiction and drama as dynamic , temporal media pay special attention to the dynamic " story " elements of action and character . A contrary procedure , namely writing fiction that " goes against the grain of the medium , " e.g. , by overemphasizing static , descriptive elements ( as does the French nouveau roman ) , exposes its limits , makes the recipient aware of the artificiality of the work and therefore fails to be in agreement with another typical feature of illusionist works : the reduction of aesthetic distance . Moreover , this signals a departure from another illusionist principle ( sec Principle Six ) . Principle Five : Generating ( an emotional ) interest in the possible world <p> Illusionist texts and artefacts do not merely offer experiential immersion in a passive way ; they actively appeal to the readers and thereby also contribute to minimalizing aesthetic distance . Such appeal is regulated by what I call the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " positive " rhetorical principle which is reponsible for various devices of persuasio that serve to render the story attractive and keep the reader " in " it . In their concern with a focus of interest , illusionist works imitate a further aspect of real-life perception , which is usually motivated by certain interests . While the fact that illusionist works induce the reader 's " immersion " in their worlds appears to be a common feature , the how , i.e. , the means by which the reader 's interest is captivated , are highly variable and may range from story-elements of " sex and crime " ( as in the embedded story in " Continuity of Parks " ) to discursive devices of maintaining suspense ( e.g. Dickens 's " cliff-hanging chapter endings " ) and thematic elements ( e.g. , of topical relevance to contemporary culture ) . In accordance with the general importance of emotions for illusionist immersion , a particular field of activity of this principle are devices and story contents ( such as love interests , tragic deaths etc. ) which appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered to be responsible for the scarcity , in typically illusionist texts , of elements such as carnivalesque comedy , since these reduce affective involvement . <p> However , it should be noted once again that generally , the realization of all illusionist principles is to a certain degree relative and rests on extratextual factors . In the case of the principle under discussion this relativity is particularly prominent . " Interest " obviously does not only depend on the text itself but also , if not primarily , on the dispositions of individual readers and on contextual factors . This relativity has led critics to become particularly wary about this principle ( cf. Nnning , Review 141,145 ) . Yet , like the category of " tellability " in the theory of narrativity ( cf. Pratt 132-51 ) , this principle ( which can in fact be conceived of as an intensified variant of " tellability " ) must be maintained at least as a formal category with variable contents in order to account for the fact that arousing interest in the recipients ( in particular in an emotional way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion . Principle Six : Cetare artem <p> The tendency of illusionist fiction to minimize aesthetic distance as well as the conspicuousness of its discourse are regulated by a last principle which , in accordance with the rhetoric and aesthetics of antiquity , the Renaissance , and the eighteenth century , may be called the " principle of celare artem " ( or of the concealment of artificiality ) . This formula is used e.g. by Dryden in " An Essay of Dramatick Poesie " ( 66 ) . Similarly to the principle of respecting the medium , the principle of " celare artem " contributes to creating a fictional analogy to the condition of real-life perception , focusing the fact that we usually disregard the limiting conditions and the mediacy of our perceptions . Works following this principle tend to conceal their mediacy and artificiality by a relative avoidance of over-intrusive self-referentiality and generally of all devices that foreground textuality or fictionality . The principle of celare artem , in particular , regulates the use of all kinds of metatextuality and , in the interest of illusionist immersion , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestations of fictionality as well as  --  together with the principle of coherence  --  for the avoidance of paradoxical devices such as metalepses . ( Here " Continuity of Parks " deviates most conspicuously from typical illusionist texts. ) 5 . Functions of Aesthetic Illusion <p> Having presented the principles of illusion  --  making , I now turn to the functions of aesthetic illusionism . Aesthetic illusion is alluring  --  for some ( including the implied author of " Continuity of Parks " ) even to a dangerous extent . This attractiveness depends on a panoply of reception-and production-centered functions , only some of which can be mentioned here . <p> Among the reception-centered functions of aesthetic illusionism , pleasurable entertainment looms large . ( Pleasurable relaxation is also the principal motivation for Cortzar 's diegetic reader , who " tastes an almost perverse pleasure " in becoming " absorbed " in his novel . ) Part of this entertainment derives from the simple exertion of the imagination as an aspect of the human capacity for transcending empirical reality . ( This also includes toying with " impossible " worlds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaleptic conclusion in " Continuity of Parks . " ) The pleasure of aesthetic illusion is also inextricably linked with a second  --  and often criticized  --  function : the escape from real-life deficiencies . ( These deficiencies may be of a general emotional , sensory , or experiential kind , e.g. , satisfying the reader 's wishes for adventures . ) In addition , aesthetic illusion also allows the reader to take on , and explore , in a playful way and without the consequences this could have in real life , personalities and patterns of behavior that would be impossible or unsuitable in reality . <p> As for production-centered functions , catering to the wishes of readers may enhance an author 's popularity and make reading his or her texts appear more attractive in a competitive market of illusionist artefacts . Where experiential illusion is moreover coupled with referential illusion , the resulting impression of " imitating reality " can also contribute to the ennobling of fiction under the auspices of a mimetic aesthetics . ( This capacity of convincingly imitating reality was frequently used as an argument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eighteenth century ) . At the same time , fictional illusionism can be a means of persuasion employed to render artefacts suitable vehicles for extraliterary purposes . I am here thinking of moral or social didacticism and criticism , but also of authors ' attempts to reassure or persuade readers with regard to the truth of certain worldviews . This persuasive function of aesthetic illusionism notably refers to the general tendendy of artefacts , and in particular of narratives , to present unified , closed , and meaningful worlds whose meaningfulness ( most conspicuously in the convention of " poetic justice " ) could be regarded as " unrealistic " and contrary to the contingency of life . To present such an " unrealistic " surplus of coherence and significance in conjunction with strong inducements for aesthetic illusion may make the reader accept this excess of coherence more easily , disregarding its constructedness . One could even argue , from a historical point of view , that aesthetic illusionism in the sense of philosophical persuasion becomes all the more relevant when the belief in the self-evidence of a meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as poetic justice is no longer supported by external , philosophical or religious beliefs , possible worlds that ( still ) propagate such views must create their own , internal credibility  --  and this can efficiently be achieved by aesthetic illusion as a means of suspending not only aesthetic but also philosophical disbelief . Of course , this works only up to a point . Where a certain degree of disbelief is exceeded , as in the postmodern era , this often leads to a departure from illusionism altogether ; the artefacts then tend to undermine the aesthetic illusion invoked by the text or performance . An analogy emerges here between the undermining of " philosophical illusions " and the breaking of aesthetic illusion . 6 . The Breaking of Aesthetic Illusion <p> The breaking of illusion is a field too vast to be treated in detail in this context , so a few remarks will have to suffice . Generally , anti-illusionism in fiction and elsewhere is a derivative phenomenon and always presupposes the existence of aesthetic illusion , be it in the same work or as a convention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old as illusionism . In addition to the cultural context , the individual recipient and the work ( and its performance ) are as much factors in the breaking of illusion as in its formation . In its essence the breaking of illusion can be defined as the realization and " inflation " of the potential of distance that already exists latently within the aesthetic illusion itself at the pole opposite to immersion . <p> Works that consistently break aesthetic illusion ( again ceteris paribus ) display features that , as is to be expected , are opposed to those of illusionist works , Rather than drawing recipients into their possible worlds and keeping them there , they deploy distancing devices so that the recipients remain " outside . " Instead of giving centrality to the level of the story , they tend to devaluate it , and instead of rendering the level of discourse inconspicuous , they foreground it . Rather than displaying a tendency towards seriousness , they are frequently comic , and in the place of a dominant heteroreferentiality they tend to emphasize self-referentiality and self-reflexivity . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metatextual allegory of the potentials of aesthetic illusionism and of its dangers . These dangers appear most clearly if one solves the paradoxical ending by regarding it as a depiction of the psychological state of the diegetic reader , whose all too illusionist reception eventually makes him even feet threatened by a character of the book he is reading . The real readers , after having been led astray by the text and the experience of illusion themselves , are meant to go one step further and to distance themselves from such a degeneration of this illusion into delusion . In this they are helped by the text 's metafictional theme , some self-reflexive reminders of fictionality , such as the phrase , " A lustful , panting dialogue raced down the pages , " and , above all , by the final adumbration of metalepsis . <p> Moreover , the features of anti-illusionistic or illusion-breaking works can also be linked with the principles of illusion outlined above , the difference being that illusionist works tend to follow these principles , while anti-illusionist texts do not . " Continuity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of celare artem by its overt self-reflexivity , but also , by suggesting a logically " impossible " metalepsis , flouts the principle of coherence and hence the credibility of the story . These relationships are visualized in figure 3 , which at the same time provides an overview of the theoretical notions used in this essay . <p> As regards particular textual devices that can cause the breaking of illusion , I can not here provide as much detail as in my earlier remarks on aesthetic illusion , where at least some devices were mentioned in the context of the principles of illusion-making . Only a schematic overview of some potentially illusion-breaking techniques can be given here ( see figure 4 ) . The techniques are arranged according to the four general features detectable in illusion-breaking works to which they principally contribute , although this does not mean that they can not also influence other features as well . 7 . Conclusion : Desiderata for Further Research <p> The foregoing discussion operates within a " philological , " primarily text-centered framework , and a text-centered theory of illusion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger theory applicable also to other media and artefacts . However , such a theory would require further research in areas that could not be treated in the present framework . <p> One of these areas is the systematic search for more historical evidence of aesthetic illusion and its properties , while another is the gathering of empirical responses of contemporary readers to certain texts and devices . The latter could shed a welcome light on the details of the interaction between text features or textual principles and their effects . A discipline in which research on aesthetic illusion could be continued with particular profit is cognitive science . Testing the " analogy thesis , " on which part of my theory is based , would be of special interest . <p> This applies , above all , to the relations between textual illusionist principles and real-life perception , notably , the seeming objectivity of perception in spite of its actual mediacy and its dependence on concepts , frames , interests , and perspectives of the perceivers . Last but not least , a desideratum for future research is certainly interdisciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also  --  and more modestly  --  between narratology and drama theory , art history , and film studies.
