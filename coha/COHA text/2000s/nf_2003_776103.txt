" Here Are No Disputes " : Reputation and Realities in the New Republic // In the course of their nearly two centuries of existence , Great Britain 's colonies in North America gained wide , increasing , and mostly admiring notice for both diversity and pluralism . This reputation rested largely upon much-advertised demographic and cultural diversities in parts of Pennsylvania and other mid-Atlantic regions , but in the late colonial and early national eras it was common to extend the observation to " the Americans " generally . When an immigrant agronomist and writer named Hector St. John de Cr ? vecoeur , in the 1780s , used broad strokes of that kind in characterizing the new society and ( along with much else ) its religious life , few of his critics accused him of exaggeration or of rhetorical flourish . // IMAGINED COMMUNITY : CR ? VECOEUR 'S COUNTRY ROAD // This learned , temperamental son of a French country gentleman had arrived in North America in the 1750s . He had served as a soldier in Canada , then had roamed the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York colony in 1770 . In 1782 he published the enormously popular Letters from an American Farmer , in which the most famous passage , to this day excerpted in most historical and literary anthologies , rhapsodizes about the diversity of the American colonial population . In answer to his own rhetorical question , " What then is the American , this new man ? " he asserted that the American was an amalgam : " Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men . " Cr ? vecoeur claimed to know a man " whose grandfather was an Englishman , whose wife was Dutch , whose son married a French woman , and whose present four sons now have wives of different nations . " His use of the generic " the American " conveyed , in this celebrated passage and elsewhere , that such living embodiments of diversity were common throughout the colonies . // Several pages later , the author expressed astonishment about the way Americans embraced radical diversity as well as frequently exemplifying it . After asking his mostly European readers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road somewhere ( unspecified ) in the colonies , he pointed first to the prosperous farm of a Catholic , " who prays to God as he has been taught , and believes in transubstantiation . " This hard worker and family man , Cr ? vecoeur avowed , was entirely accepted . " His belief , his prayers offend nobody . " And many of his neighbors were beneficiaries of the same tolerant attitude - the " good honest plodding German Lutheran , " the fiery " seceder " ( from the Church of England ) with his well-painted house , and the " Low Dutchman " who adhered to a rigid Calvinism but seemed more preoccupied with his " waggon and fat horses . " Everyone tolerated and respected everyone else . In fact , Cr ? vecoeur asserted , these radically differing believers , if their own houses of worship were too far away , might well run into each other at the Quaker meeting-house ! // How could such things be true ? The colonies had regularly experienced religious strife , and a Roman Catholic observer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less-than-observant Catholic ) had to be aware that his coreligionists in nearly all the colonies had been subjected to civil disabilities . His answer , it seems , was that in that real world where farmers or others live their daily lives , such problems had no reality . For them , at least , " persecution , religious pride , the love of contradiction , " and other forms of intolerance that " the world commonly calls religion " had been left behind in Europe . If these various householders " are peaceable subjects , and are industrious , what is it to their neighbors how and in what manner they think fit to address their prayers to the Supreme Being ? " // Although these claims about diversity and its routine acceptance appeared in an extraordinary piece of reportage , they were otherwise far from unusual . A great many European commentators on the American experiment , because they were engaged in battles back home over church establishments and religious freedom , were preoccupied with those American conditions that most contrasted with those in Great Britain or on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American situation as Great Living Ideal or as Horrible Example . // Often that sort of comparative motivation was merely a subtext or hidden agenda ; but in some cases it was very much on the surface . William Cobbett was a prominent , very feisty , English reform publicist whose favorite target of contempt was the Church of England and its " greedy , chattering , lying , backbiting , mischief-making clergy . " But in his Year 's Residence in the United States of America , published in 1819 , Cobbett extolled the American religious style . Although he was writing this memoir during the very nastiest moments of New England 's Unitarian controversy , he insisted that in America " all is harmony and good neighborhood .... Here are no disputes about religion ; or , if they be , they make no noise . " // Others who invoked and lauded the American example did so with less fire but almost as much exaggeration . The Swedish writer Fredrika Bremer testified , after a two-year American tour in the 1850s , that " nowhere on the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom attained to so full a recognisation as in the United States . " And Lord Carlisle , a prominent British statesman who visited in the early 1840s , later informed an audience in Leeds about the " nearly complete absence of polemical strife and bitterness " in the religious life of the young nation . // Not all the Europeans who remarked on American religious pluralism were equally enthusiastic . The Swiss churchman and historian Philip Schaff , even after he had migrated to the United States and become a major spokesman for American ways , acknowledged dangers in what Carlisle had called " unbounded freedom of conscience . " And a good many others were not sympathetic at all . The English novelist Frances Trollope , who spent three years in the United States in the late 1820s , considered America 's pluralistic religious life a sheer disaster . She deplored " the almost endless variety of religious factions " and the fact that , as she saw it , every religious congregation " invests itself with some queer variety of external observance that has the melancholy effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible , Trollope thought , " in witnessing all these unseemly vagaries , not to recognize the advantages of an established church . " // Plainly she got that wrong . Many who criticized the disorderly features of American religion thought an establishment of the usual sort would be far worse . Almost no one , however - whether booster , belittler , or something in between - doubted what we might call the Cr ? vecoeur Proposition : that the American religious scene was extraordinarily diverse , and that the Americans not only tolerated this diversity but welcomed and took immense pride in it . // Some promoters of these pluralist claims extended them beyond the Protestant Christian sector of American society . Cr ? vecoeur , for one , featured a Catholic believer on his ecumenical country road . Hannah Adams , a New Englander who in the 1780s compiled a remarkable " dictionary " of the world 's religions , boasted that Jews in America " have never been persecuted , but have been indulged in all the rights of citizens . " And Robert Baird , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's religious ways and sought to explain them to Europeans , depicted the blessings of freedom and respect as being showered upon virtually all opinions , including non-Christian and antireligious ones : // The Christian - be he Protestant or Catholic - the infidel , the Mohammedan , the Jew , the Deist , has not only all his rights as a citizen , but may have his own form of worship , without the possibility of any interference from any policeman or magistrate , provided he do not interrupt , in so doing , the peace and tranquility of the surrounding neighbourhood . // A few enthusiasts seemed to go even farther - for example , by implying a prevailing acceptance of the Indians and their various cultures . Among many artistic expressions of the myth of pluralist success , the best known and loved was Edward Hicks 's depiction of what he saw as the world 's first great embodiment of the Peaceable Kingdom foretold in Old Testament prophecy . In that painting , which Hicks reproduced in some one hundred versions , Indians as well as lions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in harmony . // This painting , with its references to William Penn and late-seventeenth-century history , might seem also to be suggesting that pluralist triumphs were achieved immediately in the New World environment ; but Hicks was a Quaker who knew enough of his sect 's history to recognize that things had not been that easy . Most of those who promulgated the myth of pluralist success not only recognized early difficulties ; they emphasized them . Theirs was a story not so much of instant successes as of steady progress . // Baird , accordingly , acknowledged that intolerance and persecution in the earliest years had affected many besides " the descendants of Abraham . " After chastising the founders of New England and Virginia , who had been " unwilling to accord to others the religious freedom they so highly prized for themselves , " he recounted a slow , painful , progress that had occurred at different rates in different places . Only with great difficulty had the colonists been freed from the necessity of attending an established church , and then from having to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle for the right to hold public meetings . // By the time when Baird wrote , however , the states had , one after another , followed the example of the federal Constitution and ended governmental support of religious establishments ; and all but two of them ( Baird mistakenly cited only one exception ) had discontinued what he called the " barbarism " of imposing a religious test for office-holding . Given that impressive , or perhaps astounding , half-century of growth in legal toleration , it is no surprise to find that Baird was genuinely optimistic ; and in this he spoke for most of his contemporaries . " In no part of the world , " he wrote , " can we find any progress ... which can be compared with what has taken place in the United States . " // Not only are we likely to read this kind of effusion as unduly optimistic ; as in the case of Cr ? vecoeur we may want to ask how people of Baird 's generation could have missed what now seems like abundant evidence that legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced social tolerance . Although legal disabilities affecting inhabitants of European origin were nearly gone , those imposed upon native and African populations obviously were not . As for non-European religions , the very idea that blacks or Indians had religions of their own seemed absurd to most members of the dominant culture . Baird cited , as one of the unfortunate obstacles to progress and fair treatment for the Indians , the fact that " not a single noble aspiration seems ever to enter their souls . " // Within the European population , anti-Catholic and antiforeign " nativism " had been virulent in the 1830s , and was gaining political strength during the years when Baird was writing his book . In 1844 , at about the time when his first American edition appeared , the founder of Mormonism was murdered in the jail at Carthage , Illinois . In July of that year , Philadelphia was convulsed with anti-Catholic rioting that , as one historian has put it , " turned the City of Brotherly Love into a chaos of hatred and persecution . " Two churches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the calmer city of Baltimore , John Quincy Adams , the congressman and former president , took charge of a National Lord 's Day convention whose purpose was to promote observance of a Sabbath that was not the Sabbath of the Jews or of the Seventh Day Baptists. // The failure of people like Baird to discern that toleration had not stamped out intolerance , and that persecutions would continue , should not be attributed solely to wishful thinking or American boosterism . As I have suggested , the reality of rapidly achieved toleration in the young country , and its novelty in the Western world , could easily convince Americans and their overseas admirers that a peaceable kingdom had indeed been established - or was just over the horizon . What they could not grasp , with anything like the clarity available to privileged hindsight , were the effects of another kind of reality . This was the reality of a sudden , rapid diversification - ethnic , cultural , religious - that was at least as unusual in its time as were the new nation 's constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic , almost suspicious : during the very years in which constitutional and legal toleration was advancing - step by step and state by state - bigotry and social intolerance plainly were spreading as well , or at least were becoming increasingly visible . One can perhaps see this situation as an indirect effect of the very toleration that beckoned so many " strangers " to the young country . Alexis de Tocqueville , the most astute of the nineteenth-century European observers , speculated that the fluidity built into their institutional and social structures was making Americans nervous , disoriented , and inclined to seek supposed alternative ways of restoring social cohesion . That argument is relevant here . An equally plausible explanation , however , is that a pluralist reputation achieved in one kind of world was being asked to maintain itself within a world that was changing rapidly and in fundamental ways . Advances achieved within the earlier mostly Protestant culture were not readily transferable , intact , into the new demographic situation . // CHANGING WHAT IT MEANT TO BE AN AMERICAN : THE GREAT DIVERSIFICATION // Traditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " new immigration " from southern , central , and eastern Europe - as the time of greatest and most disruptive social change in American history . Or , in recent years , we have supposed that our own era can claim that distinction as a result of an influx of new Americans , from all parts of the world , that has owed a great deal to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 - a piece of legislation that ended most of the immigration restrictions imposed forty years earlier . //
