Headnote Looking for a little dog ? Get educated before you choose . It used to be that carrying a tiny dog in an expensive handbag was the nearly exclusive behavior of aging society matrons . In recent years , the age of high society has drifted downward at least half a century , as women like Paris HiIton have set off a fashion fury with their constant carrying of diminutive canines such as Hilton 's own Tinkerbell , a Chihuahua almost as well-known as the heiress herself . Toy dogs have never been more popular or more fashionable . Cast as furry accessories in the pages of fashion magazines , the smallest dogs are suddenly the biggest trend in pets . But there are problems with being a must-have accessory for the fashion-forward , and toy dog expert Darlene Arden is happy to list them . Author of Small Dogs , Big Hearts : A Guide to Caring for Your Little Dog and a certified behavior expert specializing in small dogs , Arden is an unabashed fan of tiny canines . But she 'd also like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting one . " Small dogs are my passion , " said Arden , on the phone from her home in the Boston area . " I 've had dogs all my life , but there 's something special about the little dogs . They bond in a very different way , and they 're totally portable companions . The dog to a certain degree understands he depends on you for protection . " The dependence starts long before you ever bring a little dog home , says Arden . The popularity of small dogs means there are lots of clueless and careless people breeding them . Reputable breeders are at times hard to find , but adorable puppies from large-scale breeders ( including those hellholes that animal-advocacy groups call " puppy mills " ) and money-driven backyard breeders are everywhere . Arden says it 's Important to find the right toy breed and the right breeder , and that may take time . If you do n't proceed with caution , she warns , you may end up with a dog with severe health and temperament problems . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're like Inside . Part of what 's going on now is because the emphasis is on producing eversmaller dogs , " she says . " Teacup " is a marketing term coined by commercial breeders and backyard breeders , not by reputable breeders . Getting smaller and smaller dogs Is NOT what good breeders strive for . " Even if people do get their dog from a reputable source , they can ruin a little dog 's attitude by forgetting that their adorable little pet is , indeed , a dog . " People truly confuse these dogs with toys , " says Arden , " and that 's a huge mistake . I blame fashion editors , who feature celebrities carrying dogs as if they were accessories . But they 're not bracelets or purses . Other people turn them into child substitutes to the nth degree , dressing them in frilly dresses and Mary Jane shoes . " You have to realize a dog is another species . You 're not doing the dog a favor if you 're treating it as if it were a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to a pet who 's anything but a good companion . " There 's nothing worse than Cujo in a small package . Socialization and training are so important , because facial bites are not unusual if you end up with a nasty toy dog . " Arden is n't trying to discourage anyone from adopting a small dog , but she does want people to consider all their options before they buy . " Do a lot of research , " she says . " Figure out which toy breed you want , which fits in with how much grooming you 're prepared for , how active you are , and how big your dog should be . Find out which health problems exist in the breed . Then go to a dog show , meet with breeders , and ask them what they 're doing to eliminate those health problems . You should be able to get a health guarantee to a reasonable age if you 're dealing with a reputable breeder . " If you choose well , says Arden , you 'll be rewarded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , since many toy dogs outlive their larger relatives . Consider those extra years as your reward for choosing the dog who 's right for you , instead of choosing what 's trendy at the moment . Sidebar Little dogs have never been more popular , but people need to remember that they are , indeed , pets with real needs , not jurry fashion accessories . Sidebar Resources for those who love little dogs Darlene Arden had already written one of the best reference books on small dogs ever in 1997 . The Irrepressible Toy Dog celebrated these diminutive dogs and predicted their climb in popularity . Arden has had a chance to redo her wonderful reference , revising and updating it completely as the new Small Dogs , Big Hearts : A Guide to Caring for Your Little Dog ( $20 , Howell Book House ) . The book expands on the first one , including more information on health , behavior and training . A must-have for anyone who has or wants a little dog as a companion . - G.S .

Mass-market suppliers of books and pet products generally rely on large or wellconnected publishers for a rather limited range of titles that may not reflect the latest thinking in training , dog sports , or care and nutrition .
