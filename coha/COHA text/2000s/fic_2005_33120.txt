Chapter One I never thought I would save the world-or die saving it . I never believed in angels or miracles either , and I sure did n't think of myself as a hero . Nobody would have , including you , if you had known me before I took the world 's most powerful weapon and let it fall into the hands of a lunatic . Maybe after you hear my story you wo n't think I 'm much of a hero anyway , since most of my heroics ( if you want to call them that ) resulted from my being a screwup . A lot of people died because of me-including me-but I guess I 'm getting ahead of myself and I 'd better start from the beginning . It began with my uncle Farrell wanting to be rich . He never had much money growing up and , by the time Mr. Arthur Myers came along with his once-in-a-lifetime deal , my uncle was forty years old and sick of being poor . Being poor is n't one of those things you get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been . So when Mr. Myers flashed the cash , all other considerations-like if any of it was legal , for instance-were forgotten . Of course , Uncle Farrell had no way of knowing who Mr. Arthur Myers actually was , or that his name was n't even Arthur Myers . But I 'm getting ahead of myself again . Maybe I should just start with me . I was born in Salina , Ohio , the first and last child of Annabelle Kropp . I never knew my dad . He took off before I was born . Mom 's pregnancy was difficult and very long . She was almost ten and a half months along when the doctor decided to get me the heck out of there before I exploded from her stomach like some kind of alien hatchling . I was born big and just kept getting bigger . At birth , I weighed over twelve pounds and my head was about the size of a watermelon . Okay , maybe not the size of a watermelon , but definitely as big as a cantaloupe-one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your California variety . By the time I was five , I weighed over ninety pounds and stood four feet tall . At ten , I hit six feet and two hundred pounds . I was off the pediatrician 's growth chart . Mom was pretty worried by that point . She put me on special diets and started me on an exercise program . Because of my large head , big hands and feet , and my general shyness , a lot of people assumed I was mentally handicapped . Mom must have been worried about that too , because she had my IQ tested . She never told me the results . When I asked her , she said I most definitely was not . " You 're just a big boy meant for big things , " she said . I believed her . Not the part about being meant for big things , but the part about me not being retarded , since I never saw my scores and it was one of those things where you have to believe that your parent is n't lying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she worked as an assistant manager . Mom never got married , though occasionally a boyfriend came around . She took a second job keeping the books for a couple of mom-and-pop stores . I remember going to bed most nights with the sounds of her calculator snapping in the kitchen . Then , when I was twelve , she died of cancer . One morning she had found a tender spot on her left temple . Four months later , she was dead and I was alone . I spent a couple of years shuttling between foster homes , until Mom 's brother , my uncle Farrell , volunteered to take me in , to his place in Knoxville , Tennessee . I had just turned fifteen . I did n't see much of Uncle Farrell : He worked as a night watchman at an office building in downtown Knoxville and slept most of the day . He wore a black uniform with an embroidered gold shield on the shoulder . He did n't carry a gun , but he did have a nightstick , and he thought he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bedroom , listening to music or reading . This bothered Uncle Farrell because he considered himself a man of action , despite the fact that he sat on his butt for eight hours every night doing nothing but staring at surveillance monitors . Finally , he asked me if I wanted to talk about my mom 's death . I told him I did n't . I just wanted to be left alone . " Alfred , " he said . " Look around you . Look at the movers and shakers of this world . Do you think they got to be where they are by lying around all day reading books and listening to rap music ? " " I do n't know how they got to be where they are , " I said . " So I guess they could have . " He did n't like my answer , so he sent me to see the school psychologist , Dr. Francine Peddicott . She was very old and had a very long , sharp nose , and her office smelled like vanilla . Dr. Peddicott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember anything she said that was n't a question besides " Hello , Alfred , " and " Good-bye , Alfred . " " Do you miss your mother ? " she asked on my first visit , after asking me if I wanted to sit or lie on the sofa . I chose to sit . " Sure . She was my mom . " " What do you miss most about her ? " " She was a great cook . " " Really ? You miss her cooking the most ? " " Well , I do n't know . You asked what I missed most and that 's the first thing that popped into my head . Maybe because it 's almost dinnertime . Also , Uncle Farrell ca n't cook . I mean , he cooks , but what he cooks I would n't feed to a starving dog . Mostly we have frozen dinners and stuff out of a can . " She scribbled for a minute in her little notebook . " But your mother-she was a good cook ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I was n't giving the kind of answers she was looking for . " Do you hate her sometimes ? " " Hate her for what ? " " Do you hate your mother for dying ? " " Oh , jeez , that was n't her fault . " " But you get mad at her sometimes , right ? For leaving you ? " " I get mad at the cancer for killing her . I get mad at the doctors and ... you know , how it 's been around for centuries and we still ca n't get rid of it . Cancer , I mean . And I think , what if we put all the money we spend on these wasteful government projects toward cancer research . You know , stuff like that . " " What about your father ? " " What about him ? " " Do you hate him ? " " I do n't even know him . " " Do you hate him for leaving you and your mom ? " She was making me feel freaky , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a guy I did n't even know , and even like she was trying to get me to hate my dead mother . " I guess so , but I do n't know all the facts , " I said . " Your mother did n't tell you ? " " She just said he could n't commit . " " And how does that make you feel ? " " Like he did n't want a kid . " " Like he did n't want-who ? " " Me . Me , I guess . Of course me . " I wondered what the next thing I was supposed to hate was . " How do you like school ? " " I hate it . " " Why ? " " I do n't know anyone . " " You do n't have any friends ? " " They call me Frankenstein . " " Who does ? " " Kids at school . You know , because of my size . My big head . " " What about girls ? " she asked . " Girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend ? " Well , there was this one girl-her name was Amy Pouchard , and she sat two seats over from me in math . She had long blond hair and very dark eyes . One day during my first week , I thought she might have smiled at me . She could have been smiling at the guy on my left , or even not smiling at all , and I just projected a smile onto a nonsmiling face . " No . No girlfriends , " I said . Uncle Farrell talked to Dr. Peddicott for a long time afterwards . He told me she was referring me to a psychiatrist who could prescribe some antidepressants because Dr. Peddicott believed I was severely depressed and recommended I get involved with something other than TV and music , in addition to seeing a shrink and taking anti-crazy drugs . Uncle Farrell 's idea was football , which was n't too surprising given my size , but football was the last thing I wanted to do . " Uncle Farrell , " I told him , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Al , " Uncle Farrell answered . " You 're running around with all the risk factors for a major psychotic episode . One , you got no dad . Two , you got no mom . Three , you 're living with an absentee caretaker-me-and four , you 're in a strange town with no friends . " There was another one too ... Oh , yeah . And five , you 're fifteen . " " I want to get my license , " I told him . " Your license for what ? " " For driving . I want my learner 's permit . " " I 'm telling you that you 're about to go off the deep end and you want to talk about getting your learner 's permit ? " " That reminded me , the fact that I 'm fifteen . " " Dr. Peddicott thought it was a great idea , " Uncle Farrell said . " A learner 's permit ? " " No ! Going out for the football team . One , you need some kind of activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence and make friends . And three , look at you ! For the love of the Blessed Virgin , you 're some kinda force of nature ! Any coach would love to have you on his team . " " I do n't like football , " I said . " You do n't like football ? How can you not like football ? What kind of kid are you ? What kind of American kid does n't like football ? I suppose next you 're going to say you want to take dancing lessons ! " " I do n't want to take dancing lessons . " " That 's good , Al . That 's real good . Because if you said you wanted to take dancing lessons , I do n't know what I 'd do . Throw myself over a cliff or something . " " I do n't like pain . " " Ah , come on . They 'll bounce off you like-like-pygmies ! Gnats ! Little pygmy gnats ! " " Uncle Farrell , I cry if I get a splinter . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very easily . I 'm a very easy bruiser . " But Uncle Farrell would n't take no for an answer . He ended up bribing me . He would n't take me to get my learner 's permit unless I tried out for the football team . And if I did n't try out for the team , he promised he would put me on so much antidepressant dope , I would n't remember to sit when I crapped . Uncle Farrell could be gross like that . I really wanted my permit-I also did n't want to be so doped up , I could n't remember how to crap-so I went out for the team . Chapter Two I made the team as a second-string right guard , which basically meant I was a practice dummy for the first-string defense . Coach Harvey was a short round guy with a gut that hung over his pants , and calves about the size of my head , which , as I mentioned , was large . Like a lot of coaches , Coach Harvey liked to scream . He especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month before Uncle Farrell struck his deal with the chief Agent of Darkness , I saw how much screaming he could do . I had just let a linebacker blow by me and cream the starting quarterback , the most popular kid in school , Barry Lancaster . I did n't mean for this to happen , but I was having trouble memorizing the playbook . It seemed very complicated , especially seeing it was a document intended for big jocks , most of whom could barely read . Anyway , I thought Barry had called a Dog Right , but actually he had said " Hog Right . " That one letter makes a huge difference and left Barry on the turf , writhing in agony . Coach Harvey charged from the sidelines , silver whistle clamped between his fat lips , screaming around the hysterical screeches of the whistle as he ran . " Kropp ! " Tweet ! " Kropp ! " Tweet ! " KROPP ! " " Sorry , Coach , " I told him . " I heard ' dog , ' not ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned his head toward Barry , still twisting on the ground . He kept his body turned toward me . " Lancaster ! Are you hurt ? " " I 'm okay , Coach , " Barry gasped . But he did n't look okay to me . His face was as white as the hash marks on the field . " What play was that , Kropp ? " Coach Harvey snapped at me . " Um , Dog Right ? " I said . " Dog ! Dog ! You thought hog was dog ? How is dog like hog , Kropp ? Huh ? Tell me ! " The whole team had gathered around us by this point , like gawkers at the scene of a terrible accident . Coach Harvey reached up and slapped my helmet with the palm of his hand . " What 's the matter with you , boy ? " He slapped me again . He proceeded to punctuate his questions with a hard slap against the side of my head . " Are you stupid ? " Slap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you thick , is that it , Kropp ? " Slap-slap . " No , sir , I 'm not . " " No , sir , I 'm not what ? " " Stupid , sir . " " Are you sure you 're not stupid , Kropp ? Because you act stupid . You play stupid . You even talk stupid . So are you absolutely sure , Kropp , that you are not stupid ? " Slap-slap-slap . " No , sir , I know I 'm not ! " He slapped me again . I yelled , " My mother had my IQ tested and I 'm not stupid ! Sir ! " That cracked everybody up , and they kept laughing for the next three weeks . I heard it everywhere- " My mommy had my IQ tested and I 'm not stupid ! " - and not just in the locker room ( where I heard it plenty ) . It spread over the whole school . Strangers would pass me in the hallway and squeal , " My mommy had my IQ tested ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle Farrell asked how it was going . " I do n't want to play football anymore , " I said . " You 're playing football , Alfred . " " It 's not just about me , Uncle Farrell . Other people can get hurt too . " " You 're playing football , " he said . " Or you 're not getting your license . " " I do n't see the point of this , " I said . " What 's wrong with not playing football ? I think it 's pretty narrow-minded to assume just because I 'm big , I should be playing football . " " Okay , Alfred , " he said . " Then you tell me . What do you want to do ? You want to go out for the marching band ? " " I do n't play an instrument . " " It 's a high school band , Alfred , not the New York Philharmonic . " " Still , you probably need to have some kind of basic understanding of music , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're not going to lie around in your room all day listening to music and daydreaming . I 'm tired of coming up with suggestions , so you tell me : What are your skills ? What do you like to do ? " " Lie in my room and listen to music . " " I 'm talking about skills , Mr. Wisenheimer , gifts , special attributes-you know , the thing that separates you from the average Joe . " I tried to think of a skill I had . I could n't . " Jeez , Al , everybody has something they 're good at , " Uncle Farrell said . " What 's so wrong about being average ? Are n't most people ? " " Is that it ? Is that all you expect from yourself , Alfred ? " he asked , growing red in the face . I expected him to launch into one of his lectures about the movers and shakers or how anybody could be a success with a little luck and the right mindset . But he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we drove downtown . " Where are we going ? " I asked . " I 'm taking you on a magical journey , Alfred . " " A magical journey ? Where to ? " " The future . " We crossed a bridge and I could see a huge glass building towering over everything around it . The glass was dark tinted , and against the night sky it looked like a fat , glittering black thumb pointing up . " Do you know what that is ? " Uncle Farrell asked . " That 's where I work , Alfred , Samson Towers . Thirty-three stories high and three city blocks wide . Take a good look at it , Alfred . " " Uncle Farrell , I 've seen big buildings before . " He did n't say anything . There was an angry expression on his thin face . Uncle Farrell was forty and as small and scrawny as I was big and meaty , though he had a large head like me . When he put on his security guard uniform , he reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather of a Pez dispenser of Barney Fife , because of the oversized head and skinny body . It made me feel guilty thinking of him as a goofy screwup like Barney Fife , but I could n't help it . He even had those wet , flappy lips like Barney . He pulled into the entrance of the underground parking lot and slid a plastic card into a machine . The gate opened and he drove slowly into the nearly empty lot . " Who owns Samson Towers , Alfred ? " he asked . " A guy named Samson ? " I guessed . " A guy named Bernard Samson , " he said . " You do n't know anything about him , but let me tell you . Bernard Samson is a self-made millionaire many times over , Alfred . Came to Knoxville at the age of sixteen with nothing in his pockets and now he 's one of the richest men in America . You want to know how he got there ? " " He invented the iPod ? " " He worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorely lacking in : fortitude , guts , vision , passion . Because let me tell you something , the world does n't belong to the smartest or the most talented . There are plenty of smart , talented losers in this world . You wan na know who the world belongs to , Alfred ? " " Microsoft ? " ( Continues ... )
