<p> She 's one of Chicago 's wealthiest women , but Ann Lurie has shunned the lifestyle of the rich and famous . During her first marriage , Lurie rejected her husband 's family fortune and insisted they live on her nurse 's salary while he finished law school . <p> " I vowed to myself that I was never again going to get involved with anyone who was wealthy , " Lurie said . <p> Then she met Robert Lurie , the numbers-crunching business partner of real estate magnate Sam Zell . Smitten by his hippie looks , she consulted a psychologist when she discovered her new beau was rich . <p> After 17 years together , Robert Lurie died in 1990 , leaving an estate worth $425 million . <p> Now 58 years old , Ann Lurie still wrestles with the effects of money on her life , her children , her friendships , her romances and her charitable work . <p> Lurie is ranked the No. 1 Chicago philanthropist for this list and rated No.43 in the nation by BusinessWeek . This year , Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lurie Place in recognition of her generosity . <p> In the last 14 years , Lurie has given away more than $144 million from the estate bequeathed to her by her husband , who was only 48 when he died of colon cancer . One of Chicago 's preeminent investment entrepreneurs and a minority owner of the Chicago Bulls and White Sox , Robert Lurie earned a place on Forbes magazine 's list of America 's 400 most affluent people . <p> Robert Lurie left instructions that he wanted his estate to support cancer research and his alma mater , the University of Michigan . But the details were left to Ann Lurie , who had their six children , ages 5 to 15 , to raise at the time . <p> Lurie 's largest gifts , so far , include $40 million to the Robert H. Lurie Medical Research Center at Northwestern University and $20 million to the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center . She has also donated $37 million to the University of Michigan and its new Robert H. Lurie Engineering Center . <p> Lurie has her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greater Chicago Food Depository ; sponsorsing theater productions as well as a music and dance performance center ; underwriting an archeological dig in Egypt ; starting a Chicago spay and neuter clinic ; giving $10 million to build and maintain 2 1/2 acres of gardens in Millennium Park , and endowing a $1 million chair for breast cancer research at Northwestern in the name of Princess Diana  --  whom Lurie hosted during the princess ' only visit to Chicago three months before her death in 1996 . <p> Her most notable cause is caring for African children and their families . Lurie donated more than $4 million to establish a nursery school and infectious-disease clinics in Kenya and contributed to 20 " Save the Children " schools in Ethiopia . <p> " I do believe we all have responsibility for one another , " said Lurie , a slim , attractive strawberry blond whose classic black clothes and tasteful gold jewelry peg her as someone with understated affluence but do not reveal her position as an uber millionaire . <p> Hippies heard around world <p> Even though Lurie lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she still considers herself a hippie at heart . <p> " Lots of hippies have grown up to be quite powerful in the world . They might not talk so much about their former political ideas or what they were protesting when they were in college , " explained Lurie , who once protested the Vietnam War while in college at the University of Florida in the 1960s . <p> " At least they were interested , at least they were paying attention , at least they were willing to stand up and say , ' This is n't right . ' They were n't rolling over and capitulating , and that personality characteristic is important if you 're going to carry out some mission in the world . " <p> Her concern for others began as an only child whose parents divorced when she was 5 years old . Lurie grew up in Miami in a middle-class home with her mother , her grandmother and an aunt . <p> " My mother was adamant that women needed to be able to support themselves even if they were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Even though her mother , a hospital nurse , thought nursing was too demanding and encouraged her daughter to pursue a financial career , Lurie took up her mother 's profession . <p> But it was n't until Lurie heard the 1970s hit " He Ai n't Heavy , He 's My Brother " that she found her mantra . <p> " I remember sort of thinking to myself that I ca n't ever share that kind of love and attention with a sibling . So early on , I directed that philosophy externally . " <p> Lurie 's approach was more humanitarian than religious . Her father was Catholic . Her mother was Methodist but had Lurie baptized Episcopalian . In college , Lurie studied Eastern philosophies . <p> " I would say that I believe in some sort of higher being , but I do n't follow any sort of structured religion . " <p> Her plan was to use her nursing skills with the Peace Corps in Third World countries . But she married during her junior year of college , and her scholarship required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Principle and a Porsche <p> So , after graduation , she moved to Tallahassee and supported her husband , first as a hospital nurse , then as a public health nurse . Later , they moved to Fort Lauderdale , where he started his law practice and she worked at a county hospital , often caring for indigent migrant workers . <p> " His priorities were considerably different , " said Lurie , noting that her husband drove a Porsche given to him by his family . " Being fairly young , I postulated that people who had money were only focused on making money . " <p> After her divorce , Lurie began visiting Chicago , drawn by its diversity and cultural offerings . Lurie moved to Chicago in 1973 " not knowing a soul " and became a pediatric intensive care nurse at Children 's Memorial Hospital . <p> That year , she met 31-year-old Robert Lurie in the elevator of their Chicago apartment building ; both were on their way to do laundry . <p> He looked like Woody Allen in " Bananas " with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighting his freckles . Lurie was immediately attracted but had second thoughts when she learned of his affluence . <p> " I was worried about repeating the same scenario with my first husband because money changed him , " Lurie said . <p> The more Lurie got to know her boyfriend , though , the more comfortable she felt . Robert Lurie 's favorite book was Walden Pond by Henry David Thoreau . And like Thoreau , he prided himself on being self-sufficient . If the faucet broke , Robert Lurie would grab a wrench and fix it himself . <p> " We had a similar upbringing . We came from similar circumstances and had similar values , " Lurie said . " I certainly was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth . " <p> Soul mates and best friends <p> Robert Lurie 's father died when he was 11 years old , and he and his three siblings were raised by his mother in Detroit with help from an aunt and uncle . <p> Lurie moved in with Robert and soon became pregnant . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We both sort of knew what life was all about . We had our priorities and had come to some conclusions . We just felt we were lucky to have found one another . " <p> They were soul mates and best friends , she said . Regardless of what was going on at the office , Robert Lurie returned home every weekday on the same train . They spent most of their time with their children , rarely socializing . <p> For several years , the two were set against marriage , both having been married previously . They decided to make their relationship legally binding after their second child was born because it became " too darn complicated " to have children with hyphenated names . Besides , they were tired of having to explain their relationship to neighbors . <p> After their third child was born , the Luries decided to move from Long Grove to the affluent suburb of Winnetka . <p> " We were just sort of coming out of our hippie phase , " Lurie said . " And we thought the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it as parents , we also realized they have the best schools . " <p> The Luries remained adamant against raising " rich kids . " <p> " That was a huge issue , " Lurie said . " I think we prevented it by the fact that we did n't have a lot of household help . We kept the kids grounded . We did n't flaunt our money . I did n't have lots of fancy jewelry . " <p> Robert Lurie insisted on mowing his own lawn . In the winter , he plowed his driveway , with the kids riding along . At one point , Robert Lurie 's drive for self-sufficiency almost took them to Alaska . <p> " He loved that kind of lifestyle , and so did I , " she said . " He never lost that real love of hands-on doing stuff . " <p> Terrible news New Year 's Eve <p> In 1986 , the Luries established their family foundation and were " low-key philanthropists , " giving away up to $100,000 a year . <p> Then her husband was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After Robert died , Lurie struggled with understanding her husband 's investments  --  even buying the book Accounting for Dummies  --  along with caring for their six mourning children who were having various problems in school . <p> Now , 14 years later , Lurie 's loss is still palpable . <p> " I do n't think my kids will ever get over the loss of their father . Nor will I ever get over the loss of my soul mate , " she said . <p> Despite dispensing her husband 's millions , Lurie insists she was doing important philanthropy work even as a high school volunteer stuffing envelopes for her service club . <p> " The dictionary definition of philanthropy is to love and care about mankind , " Lurie said . " People can be philanthropists even if they never hit their checkbooks . It 's about the passion you feel towards those who are living in deprived circumstances . " <p> She insists that her job as a public health and county hospital nurse gave her as much satisfaction as she now receives giving large sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure that her impoverished clients had proper care . <p> " I consider that philanthropic , " she said . <p> Now , Lurie ascribes to something she calls " transformational philanthropy "  --  finding successful organizations and promoting them to a higher level . <p> That philosophy guided her charitable giving until a vacation in Africa persuaded her to start her own organization . <p> In 1997 , Lurie went on a sightseeing safari to southeastern Kenya with the man who would become her fiance . <p> They spent weeks scouting for wild animals , including elephants , lions , cheetahs , hyenas and leopards . <p> But it was n't the exotic animals that captured Lurie 's attention . She became engrossed in the plight of the nomadic Maasai tribe , who had no utilities or running water , no education or health care . The children had never seen a crayon or a piece of paper  --  or a white woman . <p> Two years later , Lurie began a nursery school modeled after Head Start . Still , many children were sick . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical clinic and shipped it to Kenya . <p> In effect , Lurie created her own version of the Peace Corps . It was one of the few times that she thought she might fail . <p> " This was really flying by the seat of my pants , " she said . " It was a stretch . " <p> Since then , Lurie has practically commuted back and forth from Kenya , setting up both a mobile and a permanent clinic , hiring doctors  --  even scrubbing floors on her hands and knees . The clinics also diagnose and treat HIV and AIDS . <p> Cautious in romance , friendship <p> Lurie ended her engagement in summer 2001 and says she does n't think she will remarry . <p> " I like men , " she said . " I do n't think I 'd be happy without having a guy around . But I think marriage is sort of what you do when you are creating a family . It 's not so important at my age . " <p> There is still the challenge of finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It unfortunately eliminates some people who are so competitive that they ca n't cope with the idea that their spouse might have more assets than them , " she said . " They are more driven to have the best toys . You have to be a bit cautious about what someone 's motivations might be . " <p> Lurie also has to be cautious in her friendships . <p> " This is a somewhat troubling aspect of my life , " she said . " You always say : ' Well , is there some hidden agenda here ? ' If you get too cynical , you never make connections . " <p> Lurie says she has a few good friends but spends most of her time on her philanthropy demands and her children . <p> " I do n't do lunch , " she said . " I 'm not a terribly social person . I 'm shy , and I 'm busy . " <p> She met one of her best friends , Monette Keldsen , 60 , when she hired her to redecorate her house a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual relationship , " Keldsen said . " It only works because Ann is n't afraid to do business with her friends . She knows when to pull out her working hat and when to switch to her personal hat . She is so down to earth . When I 'm around her , money is not in the picture . We just hang out . She does n't like to talk a lot . She 's very quiet . We like to read . We like to shop . She likes to lead a normal life and be like regular folks who do their own chores and go to the grocery store . She does n't like to be waited on . " <p> Yet money does overshadow some friendships . When pals are having financial problems , she says , they often hesitate asking her for help . <p> " Several of my friends owe me money , " she admitted . " We have structured loan agreements . I act kind of as their bank . Sometimes it 's not comfortable for me . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills businessman and stock trader scammed more than $1 million from friends and neighbors  --  including Lurie , who wrote him a check for $250,000 . He was sentenced to eight years in prison . <p> Even the federal government wants a cut . Since 1994 , Lurie has fought the Internal Revenue Service 's demand that she pay federal estate taxes  --  now totaling $88.6 million  --  on her husband 's bequest , arguing that such marital trusts are tax-exempt . <p> Lurie receives about 50 solicitations a month from charities . She turns most down , preferring instead to discover agencies and organizations on her own . Recently , she established individual foundations for each of her children , now adults . If she gets solicited by a charity that she thinks might fit their passion better , she forwards the request to them . <p> Kids do it their way <p> Lurie says her lifestyle now is more affluent than when her children were growing up because she hosts and attends benefits . <p> " The youngest  --  who makes her own clothes  --  rejected all the trappings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The oldest one did it , too  --  sleeping on a futon , eating meals on a card table . " <p> Lurie also is president of Lurie Investments , a for-profit business that invests in early-stage biomedical companies . Lurie puts " young , brilliant researchers " on the company payroll , freeing them up from having to raise money while they develop medical products . <p> " We 're going to solve some of the mysteries of some of these diseases , " Lurie insisted of her investments in cutting-edge medical research . <p> That would make the world a better place , which , after all , is a hippie 's mantra . <p> President of the Board of Directors , Polk Bros .
