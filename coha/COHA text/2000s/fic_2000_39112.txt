THE BEST THING ABOUT BOOTS was the way she 'd take me down to the trash pile , her all hunched over with her stick and me with a paper sack in case we found any items of interest . Mostly it was just old , beat-up shoes . Any kind of shoe you could name-platforms , spike heels , oxfords , penny loafers , and once even a crazy-looking white shoe with what looked like a shiny brown bat sprawled across the toe . Boots called it a spat . <p> Boots had this game she would always play . " Now , how come you never see the match to a shoe , wonder ? " she would ask , tilting her head and squinting her eyes just so . " Wonder where the other one is ? " And then she 'd be off , inventing all kinds of stories as to what in the world happened to that other shoe . The things she 'd come up with would make your blood curdle sometimes-stuff about the ghost of a young girl on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaring the living daylights out of some poor driver . Always it would be raining and the driver would lose control and hit a tree and get slung out of the car . And at some point when his poor , mangled body was hurtling through the air , that one lonesome shoe would go flying into the thickets , leaving the other to be hauled off to the trash pile by some mortician or something . She had a hundred different stories to explain the mystery of the missing shoe , and no matter how many times we went to that trash pile , she 'd reach down with her stick and scoop up a battered shoe and look at me in that same old way and say , " Now , how come you never see a match to a shoe , wonder ? Wonder where the other one is ? " <p> This was before Boots got disabled and had to come live with us . I liked it then . Those two weeks every summer when Daddy would call me a Midway cab and send me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though my mama 's been dead since the day I was born . I liked Boots 's little house way off in the boondocks , as my daddy always called it . I liked the way Tamisha and Zanni and Shatanga would pretend they were n't watching as I pulled my suitcase into the backseat of the cab , waving back at them as I zoomed up Eleventh Street and across town to Boots 's . <p> There was a barbed-wire fence all along the edge of Boots 's yard , and on the other side of the fence some spotted cows that were always dipping their soft heads into the clovery grass and chewing away . And beyond the cows , a silo where Mr. Mahaffey kept hay for when it got winter and the cows did n't have the sweet clover to munch anymore . <p> Boots would pull down a tub off the side of the smokehouse and fill it . When the water got warm I 'd take off every stitch of my clothes and splash around until my skin was wrinkled as crazy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked , and it did n't matter because even if a car was to drive up to Boots 's for some reason , we could hear it crunching down the dirt road ten minutes before it got there , plenty of time for me to jump out and throw a towel around my shoulders and run into the house . <p> And there were no neighbors close by , just some blacks who lived at the end of the dirt road . Boots would let me go down there sometimes to see if Clara had any Avon samples to give me . Most of the time I 'd come back with a pocketful of little bullets of lipstick named things like Tropical Ice and Tart Tangerine . Clara would watch me all the way down the road to Boots 's , calling , " You tell Mrs. Moses I 'm going to send her a big old blackberry cobbler for the Fourth , now . " If she did , I never knew about it because by the Fourth I was always long gone . <p> And then Boots was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trash pile and those odd , sad shoes and the cows and silo and from the little bullets of Avon lipsticks and Clara 's promised blackberry cobblers . She was with us now , in our house by the cotton mill , and it was like all those stories about the missing shoe were omens , it was as if all along Boots had been searching for an ending to the story of her own life . <p> When they finally let me go into Boots 's hospital room , she was all prepared to break the news . First , she let me eat some grapes and a banana from the fruit basket me and Daddy had brought . Then she pointed to a large envelope on the windowsill and asked me to hand it to her . It was the first time I had noticed how papery her hands were , like something some animal was getting ready to shed . She smelled sweet , like a festering , or like fruit gone bad . I stood a little ways off as she pulled the brown photo out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was the picture of what looked to be a : hundred-year-old man . It was weird because you could tell that the other men in. the picture had been faded out around him . He had a white beard that looked like a little spade of snow . He was wearing round wire glasses and a suit . His arms hung limp by his sides , and one leg showed its bones through the worn fabric of his pants . It was his other leg , though , that made my skin crawl up and down my body . It was gone from the knee down , and what was strapped there instead looked to be a hunk of wood whittled at the bottom into a peg . It looked like his half-empty pantleg had been twisted around and around the hunk of wood somehow , and woven in and out of some slits along the top , fastening the woody stump to his knee-bone . <p> " This is my granddaddy , " says Boots , " your great-great-granddaddy . " It hits me that Boots is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use one whenever she gets a chance if she thinks it will make a point or lead to something she needs to say about a real-life situation . <p> " Sometimes , " Boots says , " things get passed down through the generations . Like hunched backs and harelips and crossed eyes . Sometimes mental illness . Sometimes meanness . And sometimes just plain old bad luck . Your great-great-granddaddy had the same kind of bad luck I did . Losing his leg and all . Me , it was just my foot . " <p> Boots hands me the photo . " You mean he got bit by a mosquito too ? " I 'm holding the picture near the light at the window , trying to get a better look . <p> " Lordy , no , " says Boots . " He got his shot off at Shiloh . " <p> Boots told me Shiloh was one of the Civil War battles . She said it was the turning point , whatever that meant . We took Boots to our house that day in the same taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't go to sleep that night-thinking about how strange life is , how some people lose their legs and feet , sometimes their whole life , to a war . And how for others , it takes no more than a mosquito bite . <p> It did n't take Boots long to settle in at our house . Daddy got a man from the weave room to bring one of Boots 's beds over in his pickup truck . We put it in a corner of the living room by a window and pushed one of the couch end-tables over so she could have a place for her glasses and Kleenex and ointment and Pepto-Bismol for her nervous stomach . It was the end of June , and for about three days I had fun bringing stuff to her and switching channels on the TV . But then I got to thinking about those little bullets of Avon lipstick and trips down to the trash pile that I never in my life would ever see again . I was sitting at the foot of Boots 's bed , staring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door . Tamisha was braiding Zanni 's hair close to her skull in what looked like about a thousand little rows of corn . I guess I had a sad look on my face , because Boots asked what I was looking so lonesome for . " Honey , you go on out and play with those girls . What you doing all cooped up in this house with an eighty-year-old woman anyway ? I 'm fine all by myself in here . Now you go on out to play . " Boots fluffed her pillow real hard and leaned back and closed her eyes like she was going to sleep . <p> I could n't tell Boots the truth about Zanni and Tamisha and their friend Shatanga , who came over to play in the afternoons . I could n't tell her that no matter how hard I tried , they did n't want me hanging around and being friends with them . I had learned three rap songs all the way through and even braided my hair by following instructions in Teen magazine . They laughed so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bust a blood vessel . Zanni said I did n't have the rhythm God gave a billy goat , and then the three of them started rolling around in their backyard , tumbling over each other , laughing their heads off . I ran inside , and by the time I got to my room , my hair had all come loose and was hanging down my back like streamers of yellow crepe paper . <p> Daddy had said that one time our neighborhood was all white . That was when he was a little boy . He knew because he had grown up here , and the only blacks he saw were the ones from Slab Alley . They had to walk the railroad track between his house and the mill to get to town . There was a big pile of broken spindles from the spinning room that the mill had dumped in the culvert by the tracks . Daddy said him and his friends used to throw the spindles at the blacks as they passed . <p> When Daddy got to be sixteen , he got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They got married two years later and moved in this house . Daddy said when integration got started , blacks began moving into the mill houses . That 's when the whites who could afford it started moving away into the neighborhood on the other side of the mill called Midway , though midway between what he did n't say . <p> I thought it was weird that the only blacks my daddy ever saw were those strangers walking the railroad tracks . I just about do n't know anybody but blacks since we 're the only white family left on the mill hill , and I sure as heck would n't throw broken spindles at any of them , even if I had some broken spindles to throw . <p> Daddy told me always to be nice to everybody , no matter what color . He helps me out and explains things to me the best he can for a man , like that first day of first grade , the thing our teacher said to the whole class that got me all confused . Mrs. MacMurray drove over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill Grammar School . I liked having another white person in our schoolroom , even if it was the teacher . We were all sitting real quiet in our desks . Mrs. MacMurray finished calling the roll , then came around to the front of her desk and leaned on it . <p> " Now , girls and boys , " she said , tapping a ruler in her palm . " I 'm going to tell you something that I do n't want any of you to forget . " I was looking straight at her leg . It looked like a tree stump , and I could see she had dabbed clear fingernail polish onto her stocking where a run was beginning . " Yes , boys and girls , you are not ever to forget that in this classroom we are all white . " I like to have swallowed my tongue . My eyes traveled up the yellow ruffles of her blouse and landed on her face . Her head was tilted back just a little , and her eyes were almost closed . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same look Boots would get in the trash pile when she was about to ask about the missing shoes . <p> I looked around the room real slow . I looked at the girl to my left and then at the boy in front of her . I looked to my right and then at the back of the neck in front of me . I had never seen so much black skin in one place at one time . " You listen to your teacher , " Daddy had said . " She 's there to give you an education so you wo n't have to go to work in the mill when you grow up . " I did n't know about this education stuff anymore . It was going to be harder than I thought . <p> I pulled the curtain back again , just a little , and looked out . Shatanga was there now . Zanni was weaving purple clover blossoms into a necklace . Tamisha had one around her head , and Shatanga had three or four draped around her neck like a Hawaiian girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shaking her hips real fast in a hula dance . I looked to the alley , and there was Tyrone Mobley and his younger brother Ronald headed down toward Springdale . Shatanga liked Tyrone and was always chasing after him on the school grounds , though he just kept running faster and faster away from her . <p> When Tyrone and Ronald had disappeared , Shatanga fell onto the grass again , doubling over laughing until Tamisha and Zanni joined in , laughing and rolling around , over and over each other until they looked like one big whirl of arms and legs . <p> I hated how much fun they had together . They 'd never let a girl with a silly name like Sandy play with them . They said their names were African names for their roots and all and that Sandy was n't even a name . It was just a description , Shatanga had said . A description of the ground , she 'd said . I 'd never thought of it that way . Daddy told me Mama named me after Sandra Dee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when she did , she picked the prettiest name she could think of , though she never once got to look me in the face and say it . But who ever heard of Sandra Dee ? Shatanga was right . As far as anyone else knew , I was named after a hunk of ground . just a plain old sorry hunk of ground . <p> About a week after Boots came to live with us , she told me to bring her the photo of her granddaddy , my great-great-granddaddy . I got up from my spot at the foot of her bed , where I was going back and forth between watching a rerun of The Brady Bunch and peeking out the window at Zanni and Tamisha and Shatanga , who had draped themselves with some flowery curtains Shatanga 's mama threw away . <p> I went to the shelf by the TV and got the picture for Boots , though I did n't care to spend my afternoon looking at that stump with the hunk of wood strapped to it . It was bad enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her own stump , taking off those nasty bandages and putting on ointment and fresh bandages . I guess I should have done it , since Daddy was always at work when Boots got a hankering to change the dressing . Anyway , I brought Boots the picture , and she patted the bed beside her for me to sit down . I could tell she was about to begin one of her stories . <p> She was holding the picture for both of us to see . " Look real . good and tell me what you see , " she says . I do n't see anything but that old man and the hunk of whittled wood strapped to his knee . She tells me to look at what 's around my great-great-granddaddy . I guess I 'm dense because she finally has to show me the very edge of another wooden leg right beside his . Boots explains that beside my great-great-granddaddy is his cousin Baxter , though all of Baxter has been faded out by the photographer except for that bit of wooden leg that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me this picture was taken at a reunion of their company fifty years after the war . The photographer made one group photograph and then a separate copy of each man with all the others faded out . I 'm getting tired of looking at that stump of a leg , but Boots sometimes has to give a lot of background before she can get to the point . <p> Boots then tells me the strangest thing . Baxter had lost his right leg , and my great-great-granddaddy had lost his left . She said it just happened that they wore the same size shoe , and after the war they 'd go into town together and buy one pair of shoes and split it down the middle like it was a fudge sundae or something .. She said this caused them to have a special bond and that they practically lived together for the rest of their lives , one wearing the right shoe to a pair and the other wearing the left . <p> When Boots finished the story , she looked at me like there was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . She finally comes right out and tells me. that I should n't sit around wanting something Zanni and Tamisha and Shatanga have . She says I 've got to turn it around where I 've got something they want . Like the way my great-great-granddaddy had something Baxter needed and Baxter had something my great-great  --  granddaddy needed . " That 's how friendships are made , " she says , slipping the photo back into its envelope and leaning her head back onto the pillow . <p> That night I could n't get my great-great-granddaddy and Baxter out of my mind . I was glad Baxter had been faded out . It would have been terrible to have to look at two wooden stumps in the same picture . Still , I felt sad and proud at the same time that they had given their legs fighting in a war as famous as the Civil War . I began to almost wish I was missing a leg , though I pushed that thought out of my mind as soon as it popped into it . I knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did the next best thing to losing a leg . I scrounged around in my dresser drawers and found some old shirts and dresses , and I did n't stop until I had cut out and stitched up the finest Confederate flag I 'd ever seen . The next morning I hung it on the front porch and watched it flutter in the breeze . But when Daddy came home from work , he took one look at my flag and snatched it down and shook it in my face like I had committed a crime . <p> " Girl , do you want to get us burned out of this house , lock , stock , and barrel ? " And before I had a chance to answer he was ripping my flag into a hundred pieces and slamming the screen door behind him . It 's a mystery to me how grownups act sometimes . <p> I spent the rest of the day and the next morning sitting at the foot of Boots 's bed , flipping channels and peeping through the curtains at Zanni and Tamisha and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been using as a clubhouse . Then Boots asks me to do something I just ca n't believe . She wants me to go to the foot closet and bring her foot . I like to have died when she asked me that . <p> Boots had the doctor put her foot in a jar of formaldehyde so she could bring it home . She said when she died she wanted it buried with her , so when she rose on the other side God would have an easier time making her whole again . Daddy put the jar in the hall closet , which from then on became known as the foot closet . The only other thing in there was a trunk of clothes that belonged to Daddy 's dead mama and daddy . <p> I went to the kitchen and got a hand towel and went into the hall . I stood in front of the closet door for about five minutes before I got up the nerve to open it . When I finally did , there it was-Boots 's foot , all white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark closet . I flung the towel over the jar like I was sneaking up on a wild animal . I walked real careful back to Boots 's bed and handed it to her , towel and all . <p> " Lord have mercy , " Boots said . " You act like you 're scared to death of my poor old foot that could n't harm you even if it wanted to . " Boots took the towel off and set the jar on the bedside table and just stared at it . " You know , one day me and this foot both will be gone , just like Granddaddy and Baxter , though they did n't have the good luck to take both their feet with them when they passed over . " <p> She was getting plain old gruesome . I could n't listen to any more talk about death and feet , so I went back to watching Zanni and Tamisha , and Shatanga , who had now joined them , paint what looked like a big voodoo head in red and black and green on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this for a few days . Boots , every afternoon just before General Hospital came on , asked me to fetch her foot . I brought it to her wrapped up in a towel and then went right back to watching Zanni and Tamisha and Shatanga going in and out of the clubhouse with that big scary voodoo face on the side . I sat there wishing I knew what they were doing in there , the three of them with their African names and their roots and their heads all braided into a hundred rows . I would gladly trade my limp yellow hair for the wiry black stuff on their heads . I would send my great-great-granddaddy and Baxter and Boots and everyone else I knew , dead or alive , into slavery if I could go inside that clubhouse just once and wear those flowery drapes and do secret rituals and stuff . <p> " You got to turn it around to where you 've got something they want , " Boots had said . She had dozed off and started to snore . On the pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shriveled face , and I swan if she did n't have that jar in bed with her , in the crook of her arm like a long-lost child or something . To this day I wish what seeped into my brain at that minute had never seeped in . But it did . <p> I gathered up a bunch of crayons and markers and grocery bags and spread them on the kitchen table . I got the glue and scissors and started scribbling out words and sayings in big enough letters to get Zanni and Tamisha and Shatanga 's attention . After ripping up about five signs , I. finally came up with one that nobody in their right mind could resist . It was in squary red and blue and green letters . It said : COME SEE WHAT YOUR EYES HAVE NEVER BEFORE WITNESSED-A REAL LIVE HUMAN FOOT IN A JAR . PLEASE KNOCK SOFTLY ON BACK DOOR FOR VIEWING-SICK OLD LADY TRYING TO SLEEP . Across the top of the sign in even bigger letters I wroteFREE ! Then I got to thinking what Daddy had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had to pay for it . I marked through the word FREEI and covered it with another piece of grocery bag : that read : ALL FOR THE LOW PRICE OF 25 CENTS ! <p> I taped the sign to the back porch banister where Zanni and Tamisha and Shatanga could see it . I went back inside and tiptoed over to Boots 's bed and quietly climbed up . Boots was still asleep , and I sat there trying to figure out how I could slip the jar out of her arm without waking her . It had got to where she kept the jar with her all the time now , though we went right on calling the closet we used to keep it in the foot closet . <p> Once in a while I glanced out the curtain toward the clubhouse . No matter how many times I had looked at it , that voodoo face with its big black circles around those red eyes sent a chill down my spine . Zanni and Tamisha and Shatanga came out with a jam-box . I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my fingers crossed , but they just kept on walking and snapping their fingers and singing until they had disappeared around the corner of their house . <p> My heart sort of sunk in my chest until I saw them coming out again , each one eating a sandwich or something . They were almost to the clubhouse when Shatanga caught sight of my sign . She took a bite and stopped . Zanni and Tamisha were at the door before they saw Shatanga and turned to follow her to the edge of the yard , where she stood chewing and straining her eyes toward the sign . <p> Shatanga reads the sign out loud . They 're not singing anymore , just chewing and looking at my sign . My heart 's beating real fast . They are talking to each other , though I ca n't make out their words . Then Shatanga shouts to Zanni and Tamisha , " Twenty-five cents ! You are crazy , girl . She ai n't got no foot in a jar in there ! " Then they turn and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voodoo face and into the clubhouse . <p> I feel a knot coming in my throat and a few tears inching up in my eyes . That foot was my last chance , and I had failed , just like everything else in my life . just like the flag I had worked so hard making , and then Daddy ripped it up right in my face . My heart jumped a beat when I thought of Daddy and that flag . It was almost time for him to be home from work , and if he saw that sign on the porch he would kill me . My tears dried up fast , and I went outside and tore the sign down and stuffed it way down into the garbage can . <p> I 'd be my own club . Who needed anybody else ? Who cared whether or not I had anything in this whole world that anybody else wanted or needed ? I 'd be president , vice-president , secretary , and treasurer all rolled into one . I 'd decide on the name of the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the side of it . These thoughts made me happy for a few minutes , hut then I got sad again , knowing when it came time for me to collect the weekly dues , nobody would be there to pay them . <p> The next morning , after Daddy had left for work , I decided to turn my thoughts back to me and Boots . She was talking less and less now . I 'd try to get her to tell me a story , and sometimes she 'd make a good start , but then she 'd get so tired she 'd cut it short right when it was beginning to get good . I even got down her envelope one day and pulled out the photo of my great-great-granddaddy and his peg leg . But she just looked at it a second and pushed it away and closed her eyes . <p> I would cheer both of us up , I thought , and went to work making lemonade and spreading peanut butter between vanilla wafers . I was in the middle of arranging these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back screen door . I just about died when I looked up and found Shatanga and Tyrone Mobley staring me in the face . <p> Shatanga looked pretty in a clean pair of white shorts and a blue tank-top . She was acting sweet , not her usual mean self . We just stared at each other for a few minutes . Then Shatanga said real soft , " Hey , Sandy , Tyrone and me want to see that foot you 've got in there . I 've got a quarter . " She held out her hand , and there was the quarter shining up bright from the center of her palm . Tyrone was looking from me to Shatanga and back again . His skin was light next to Shatanga 's , creamy like the peanut butter I 'd been spreading . His hair looked like a small shipping crate sitting right on top of his head . <p> I panicked for a minute , and then took a deep breath to calm myself . " You 'll have to come back , " I whispered , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed back before I could get it all the way closed . " When ? " she said in her usual hateful voice , though Tyrone was standing right there beside her , listening . " Thirty minutes , " I said , keeping my voice as low as I could and pushing the door so hard Shatanga had to snatch her hand out of the way so it would n't get smashed . <p> I looked at the lemonade and plate of peanut butter vanilla wafers . I could serve Shatanga and Tyrone some before the viewing : Boots 's teeth were bad enough as it was , and no telling how long it would be before she woke up again anyway . <p> My heart was pounding . I could n't just take Shatanga and Tyrone into the living room where Boots was sleeping . I had not thought this thing through . She might wake up and see them standing over her and have a heart attack . Somehow I 'd have to get the foot away without waking her . I 'd put it back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door for Shatanga and Tyrone to see , there it 'd be , all lit up and mysterious , like something from outer space or Africa . I 'd scribble out a quick sign to prop against the jar : " Foot missing due to mosquito bite gone bad . " Beside it I 'd place the picture of my great-great-granddaddy with another sign : " Foot missing due to Civil War . " <p> They 'd probably need more vanilla wafers and lemonade to calm them down . Then they 'd want to bring Zanni and Tamisha to prove that they 'd seen it . Then probably the whole neighborhood would start coming , until my house was the most popular place around and I could n't get anything else done because of all the friends I 'd have . <p> I went into the living room and tiptoed to Boots 's bed . She was lying so still I had to bring my cheek down close to her face to tell she was breathing . A warm something hung there just above her shriveled lips , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sucked the breath out of a sleeping baby , though all it was really after was the milk that had dried on the baby 's mouth . <p> I looked around for the jar . It was not on the end table . I panicked . Boots had the cover pulled up to her neck , and I knew she had the jar in bed with her . I moved my eyes down the length of her body until I saw the shape of it beneath the blanket . <p> I held my breath and eased my hand in , trying hard not to touch Boots 's skin . Then I could feel the smooth glass that was still cool there in the crook of her bony arm . My fingers were on the rim of the jar , and I began to move it slow and easy away from Boots and out from under the heavy cover . Then Boots 's eyes popped open , darting wild every which way , and I let out a little scream and grabbed the jar with both hands just as Boots grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , away from both of us toward the TV , where it busted into a thousand pieces and all the formaldehyde went trickling in little rivers down the dark screen . <p> Boots was making sounds I 'd never heard before . Far down in her throat and chest . Deep , like what used to rise up out of the thickets beyond the trash pile where all those mismatched shoes lay , their leather cracking like old snakeskins in the hot sun . <p> " Shh , shhhh , " I kept saying , " it 's OK , Boots , shhhh . I pulled her blanket up to her neck and smoothed the white hair away from her sweaty forehead . When I saw she was all right , I ran to the TV and got down on my knees , not caring if my hands and legs were being cut by all that broken glass . I pulled the bottom edge of the bedspread up and looked underneath . A thick layer of dust mixed with cotton from the mill covered the floor , floated there like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of Boots 's body . <p> I began to cough and sneeze , and when I pulled my head out from under the bed , I saw the trail of formaldehyde glittering against the linoleum . I followed it on my hands and knees across the floor and over the doorsill into the kitchen , where Boots 's foot had come to a standstill at the base of the screen door , outside which Shatanga and Tyrone now stood looking down , their mouths and eyes gaping in disbelief . <p> Boots did n't live long after that . A day , maybe two . Daddy said she died in her sleep of natural causes , though I do n't know how there could be a natural cause for something as weird as death . <p> Shatanga and Tyrone took off in a hurry after seeing me there on my hands and knees , all bloody , groping for Boots 's foot . I picked it up with tongs from the cabinet drawer and put it in a clean jar I filled with alcohol . I tried to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed her eyes the way she did that last time I got out the picture of my great-great-granddaddy . I reached across her and carefully pulled back the cover and set the jar against her arm . Boots never said another word . <p> We buried Boots , as she had wanted , with her foot , though I 'm ashamed to admit I did think for a minute or two about how close I had come to getting Shatanga and Tyrone and maybe even Zanni and Tamisha to be friends with me . I finally had something they wanted . " That 's how friendships are made , " Boots had said . But I wiped that temptation right out of my head . <p> I guess it 's only natural , after all , for human beings to want both their feet with them when they wake up on the other side . Who knows what might be waiting there to send them scrambling for this world again ? Or what wondrous sights-hills and valleys lousy with angels and harps and flowers-what wondrous sights might hurry them , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
