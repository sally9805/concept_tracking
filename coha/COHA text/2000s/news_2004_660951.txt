<p> Leading a group of Navy SEALs on raids in Baghdad 's maze of maze of neighborhoods , Lt. Cmdr. Jamie Cartwright turned up tatooed members of Saddam Fedayeen , Palestinian terrorists , and makers of fake passports . <p> Over 300 combat missions in six months , he also discovered something about his own men . <p> Specialized in raids to kill or capture most-wanted leaders , the SEALs proved very adept at a softer but equally essential skill : gathering intelligence . <p> Young SEALs would " jump in the back of helicopters ... to photograph the targets " and sleuth out street-level sources , he says . After a raid , they scoured houses for documents , cell- phones , and other tips that could lead to quick , follow-on action . <p> " The guys got really good at searching these homes , " said LCDR Cartwright of SEAL Team 5 , noting that his men had from two days to as little as 20 minutes to prepare a mission . <p> As the Pentagon 's lead troops in the war on terrorism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a far more robust and independent role in intelligence and undercover operations as their numbers , deployments , and funding grow at an unprecedented rate . <p> Indeed , some senior military officers are calling for a transformation of the 49,000-strong force around the imperative for a new , secretive , and ethnically diverse intelligence cadre capable of tracking down sophisticated terrorist networks such as Al Qaeda and its leader , Osama bin Laden . " A robust cadre of humint human intelligence forces organic to SOF Special Operations Forces would give us perhaps the most important aspect of operations-intelligence fusion that one could get in the field , in direct support of counterterror , " says Lt. Gen. Norton Schwartz , director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff . <p> Yet the shift is also stirring controversy over what some military analysts view as the potential pitfalls of blurring the traditional line between Special Operations and the CIA , especially in the realm of covert action . <p> Today , the Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) is already exercising unprecedented authority under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The war in Iraq has seen the largest Special Operations deployment since Vietnam , with more than 80 percent of its deployed forces now in the Central Command area ( the Middle East , Central Asia , and North Africa . ) <p> Given the biggest budget increase in its history , SOCOM 's funding is projected to increase over the 2003 level by 20 percent per year for the next five years , as it adds 4,000 people to its ranks and dozens of new helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft . The personnel increase will include Navy SEALs , Army Special Forces ( also known as Green Berets ) and Civil Affairs soldiers , and a new 85-man Marine Special Operations unit , Det 1 , which is preparing to deploy to Iraq in April . <p> As part of this growth , the command , based in Tampa , Fla. , is carving out a new niche by expanding its intelligence capabilities across the board . It is adding 700 people to its US and overseas regional headquarters to analyze intelligence - gathered by its own forces as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and to plan Special Operations-led missions with an emphasis on agile responses to short-term intelligence . <p> The nexus of the effort is a new Center for Special Operations , a " warfighting hub " with sole responsibility for " planning , supporting , and executing Special Operations in the war on terrorism , " says SOCOM 's commander , Gen. Bryan " Doug " Brown . If ordered by the president or Defense secretary , SOCOM 's beefed-up headquarters now allows it to reverse roles and direct operations anywhere in the world supported by US regional commanders - instead of supplying forces to serve under them . <p> New intelligence channels <p> Another way Special Operations leaders are boosting their intelligence capabilities is by leveraging ties with foreign counterparts . For the first time , coalition partners from " several " countries are stationed at SOCOM headquarters , General Brown says . <p> Intelligence-sharing agreements are also in the works between the Pentagon and close allies , says Thomas O'Connell , assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict . " We are pushing very hard ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get them access to the Sipernet classified Internet , break down these barriers , and we will start seeing the type of access and exchange that we need . " <p> With US and foreign Special Operations Forces together in combat , restrictions on information sharing such as the " NOFORN " no foreigner classification cease to make sense , defense officials say . " You have this goofy warning on intelligence that says ' NOFORN ' that I think is sometimes overused , " says Mr. O'Connell . " If someone is fighting and dying with you , at that particular time you do n't consider them a foreigner . You consider them a very close ally . " <p> Meanwhile , in coming years larger numbers of US Special Operations Forces will be based overseas for longer rotations , to strengthen bonds with foreign counterparts and gain local access . All these initiatives will build upon the street-level intelligence-gathering skills that elite forces are already demonstrating in Iraq and Afghanistan , military officials say . In Iraq , for example , such troops are generating their own intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across zones controlled by different military units - without necessarily relying on CIA spy satellites or other intelligence information . <p> " They 've developed their own intelligence networks . They 've gone out , they 've grabbed people , and they 've effectively shut down a tremendous portion of the problem that exists today , " says O'Connell . " Each action often results in additional intelligence ... what I personally call a bounce , " he says . " If you hit him in a certain way , something develops from that hit . " <p> Bolstering this independent ability of Special Operations Forces to gather human intelligence may be as vital to defeating terrorists as are combat skills . " This community needs to morph ... and become less kinetic , more nuanced , more collector , " General Schwartz , a former SOCOM deputy commander , told a Special Operations gathering last month . He outlined an idea for a future " black , " or covert , Special Operations intelligence cadre with cultural and language skills that could operate in disguise . " We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , speaking of terrorist networks . <p> Such a force would not conflict with today 's unprecedented cooperation between Special Operations Forces and CIA operatives , say military and defense officials . <p> " Regarding the interaction between CIA and SOF , I would say , one , there is enough work for everybody , " O'Connell said in an interview . " Two , I do n't think the relationship between the CIA and Special Operations Forces has ever been closer , and , three , both have their own distinct role . The CIA can certainly provide many considerable advantages to SOF , but their primary mission is still to recruit spies , and SOF is much larger than the CIA . " <p> Blurred roles <p> Still , some military officers and analysts raise concerns about a blurring of roles between the CIA and Special Operations . " The new and apparently ad hoc policy of integrating SOF and CIA operations together in combat " has " eroded distinctions between SOF and the CIA , " writes Army Col. Kathryn Stone in a research paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special Operations Forces in covert action carries several risks : Such forces , if captured , would lose their Geneva Convention protections that govern conduct in war . Such actions could also alienate foreign governments and prompt them to use soldiers to conduct covert activity against the US . Then , too , traditional military activities are not subject to congressional oversight the way CIA covert action is , notes Jennifer Kibbe , a fellow at the Brookings Institution here who explored the problem this month in a Foreign Affairs article , " Rise of the Shadow Warriors . " <p> In response , Defense officials acknowledge the possible loss of Geneva Convention protections , but assert that few of America 's adversaries honor the statues . The need for Special Operations Forces to work undercover outweighs the risks , they say . " For those who were questioning our ability to do that operate under cover , and there was some talk that they would take that away , it 's not going to happen on my watch , " O'Connell says . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . @ @ @ @
