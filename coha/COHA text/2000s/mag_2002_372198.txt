Three years ago , Bill Sopko Sr. made the biggest gamble of his business career . With the economy booming , Sopko , the owner of an automotive-parts plant in Euclid , Ohio , invested $6 million in the latest gear to manufacture a critical brake component for heavy trucks . With a new 3,000-ton stamping press , he would reduce costs from $14 per unit to $9 . Recouping his investment , he knew , could take as long as 10 years . But with plenty of orders in the pipeline , Sopko figured he had made a shrewd move . What he did n't calculate was getting caught in a global steel war . <P> Late last year the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that American steelmakers had suffered " serious injury " as a result of a surge in imports and , as a remedy , proposed trade restraints , including tariffs as high as 40% on foreign steel products . Big domestic steelmakers say they wo n't survive without protection from what they call a deluge of foreign steel . President Bush faces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed sanctions , which he is expected to approve . His decision will ripple through the global economy  --  affecting prices of everything from cars to office buildings , and jobs from Ohio to South Korea . <P> No one disputes that most of America 's old , integrated mills  --  the ones that make steel from iron ore in huge blast furnaces  --  are ailing badly . In 1998 , amid a financial crisis that dampened Asia 's demand for steel , exports from that region flooded the U.S. and drove prices to 20-year lows . Thirty U.S. steelmakers have filed for bankruptcy protection in the past five years , including icons such as LTV and Bethlehem Steel . With a strong dollar still favoring imports and a global recession crimping demand , the U.S. firms staying afloat say their position is precarious . The most efficient and profitable American steelmakers  --  the so-called mini-mills that refine steel from scrap metal  --  stand to pick up market share from the dying dinosaurs . But even the mini-mills are now clamoring for trade protection . <P> That is not all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waive antitrust law and let it merge with Bethlehem Steel , National Steel and other troubled companies . USX-U.S . Steel also wants the government to assume the unfunded pension and retiree-health-care obligations of its takeover targets  --  estimated at $13 billion over the actuarial lifetimes of retirees . At Bethlehem Steel  --  operating under Chapter 11 protection since October  --  13,000 workers now support benefits for 130,000 recipients . Much of the money , the steelmakers say , could come from revenues generated by tariffs on imported steel . " If we get tariff relief and legacy-cost relief , you 're taking money from importers who caused injury and sending it to retirees , " says Bethlehem 's recently installed CEO , Robert Miller , who helped Chrysler win a government bailout in 1979 . <P> What 's good for big steel , though , is likely to spell trouble for the larger U.S. economy  --  and especially for workers , managers and shareholders of American companies that use steel . The metal is a major component in thousands of industrial and consumer products , from machine tools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products face tough competition from goods made in countries where steel is already cheaper than in the U.S.
