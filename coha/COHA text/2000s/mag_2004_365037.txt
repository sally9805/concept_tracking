With 500,000 units sold since its 2002 debut , iRobot 's vacuum cleaner the Roomba is a hit . But the new Roomba Discovery ( $249 ) works even better . Its DirtDetect feature prompts the vacuum to spend more time on trouble areas . Smart sensors know when the sucker is stuck and help it dislodge . And the dustbin is three times as large . But in TIME 's tests , the Discovery still got stuck on the edges of a rug and missed dust in corners . It 's fun to watch , though .  --  By Anita Hamilton
