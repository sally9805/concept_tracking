<p> Dave Mitchell , the crusading West Marin newspaperman who has chronicled corruption , folly and everyday oddities with equal zeal , has always had a nose for news . But once in a while a good story just falls from the sky . <p> In 1996 , a Mill Valley woman tried to kill herself by driving off a 500-foot ocean cliff just south of Stinson Beach . But she neglected to unhook her seat belt . Her red Toyota plunged over Highway 1 , banging against the cliff as it tumbled end over end , and landed perfectly on all four tires on the shore , a giant boulder away from Red Rock nude beach . Climbing the boulder , a herd of naked people watched in amazement as the woman was helped from her car and a rescue helicopter dropped down to pluck her away . <p> Mitchell , the Pulitzer-Prize winning publisher of the mighty little Point Reyes Light , was on the scene . " I was on the nude beach , " Mitchell said , letting out a laugh that falls somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With my camera , with our Spanish-language columnist and his son . I took some shots , nude , watching all these nudists staring up at the helicopter . And then I put my pants on and covered the rest of the story . " <p> So it goes in lovely West Marin , a string of unincorporated towns and rural communities spread across 400 square miles , whose concerns and characters Mitchell has covered for 30 eventful and sometimes perilous years . But he 's no longer the editor-publisher of the little paper with the big reputation . Frazzled after all those 13-hour days and long-running battles with pricey lawyers and national park officials , Mitchell sold the financially troubled Point Reyes Light last month to an ambitious young writer named Robert Plotkin . <p> The grizzled newsman will continue writing his crisp weekly column , Sparsely Sage and Timely , railing against injustice and reveling in the simple pleasures of life in Point Reyes , where foxes and deer cross paths with the artists , organic farmers and well-heeled weekenders who roost there . <p> Synanon scoops <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1979 when it won a public service Pulitzer for exposing Synanon , the onetime drug rehabilitation center in Marshall that devolved into a violent and corrupt tax-exempt corporate cult . After revelations in the Light about beatings of ex-members , enforced vasectomies and arms hoarding  --  as well as a failed attempt to murder a cult critic by putting a rattlesnake in his mailbox  --  Synanon was put out of business by the Internal Revenue Service . <p> Mitchell , who wrote the Synanon stories with his then-wife and co-publisher , Cathy , made the Light the lively voice of West Marin , a patchwork of 14 villages including Bolinas , Woodacre and Point Reyes Station . The 15,000 or so people who live out there care passionately about local issues such as the proposed elimination of non-native deer , the fate of the red-legged frog , the wholesale price of milk , mercury levels in Tomales Bay and mushrooming housing costs that have forced out working-class families . <p> Mitchell has covered those stories and countless others , from barn fires and oyster farming to runaway cows and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of publishing a homegrown weekly wore him down . <p> " I finally just burned out , " said Mitchell , 62 , a tall , gangly man with a graying beard who brings to mind Herb Caen 's description of the aging John Steinbeck as " a shaggy wolf of a man . " He was sitting in the living room of the rustic wood house he built on a hill in Point Reyes Station . It looks out to horse pastures and the pine-covered Inverness Ridge . <p> Depression set in <p> A folksy guy with a Stanford education , Mitchell tamped down the Captain Black tobacco in his corncob pipe , noted the black-headed juncos hopping on his deck and spoke about his long run as an activist country editor . He talked about the money crunch that nearly sank the Light in 2004 , the depression that caused him to pull back from the paper in the spring and his decision to accept Plotkin 's repeated offers to buy the paper . <p> " One of the signs of clinical depression is extreme irritability . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ai n't cool , ' " recalled Mitchell , who wrote about his emotional state , the paper 's precarious finances and his divorce from his fourth wife , Ana Carolina , in a May 12 column called " Good to be back . " <p> He 'd disappeared from the Light for two months , getting his head together after one of his worst years since he and Cathy bought the Light in ' 75 . By the end of fiscal 2004 , the paper was about $30,000 in the red ; advertisers owed money , Mitchell said , and a bumbling bookkeeper failed to send out renewal notices , resulting in the temporary loss of 300 subscribers . That hurts when your circulation is about 4,000 . When word got out the Light was in trouble , supporters stepped forward with cash contributions , took out two-year subscriptions and even urged the Light to raise its price . <p> " When 16 people sign a letter to the editor saying raise your cover price from 75 cents to $1  --  when the public demands something like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new business manager cut costs and straightened things out , and the Light ended fiscal 2005 slightly in the black , Mitchell added . <p> Staff of three <p> In the midst of all that , he was leading his full-time reportorial staff  --  one paid writer and two interns  --  in a drawn-out fight with federal park officials over the abusive behavior of a Point Reyes National Seashore ranger accused of illegally pepper-spraying a couple of teenagers and spraying motorcyclists with a water hose , among other things . <p> Mitchell , who wrote in his farewell column as editor that he 'd always tried to " make sure the ' little guy ' is n't crushed by the powers that be , " ranks the pepper-spray story as one of the Light 's most significant . " Because somebody was physically abused , injured by an authority , " he said . The paper reported this summer that the park service had paid a $50,000 settlement to the pepper-spray victims , and that the officer , who was transferred , paid $1,000 to the motorcyclists he 'd hosed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire department ) . <p> " I 've always welcomed getting into a righteous fight , " said Mitchell , a San Francisco native who grew up in Berkeley and was shaped politically by the civil rights movement . " But like any fight , it drains you a little bit . On top of all that other stuff we were doing , I was just exhausted . I said , ' I do n't know how many more years I 'm going to be able to do this . ' " <p> After the S.F. Weekly wrote about the Light 's financial troubles , newspaper brokers called to set up a sale to one of the chains buying up small papers . Mitchell , who some years had to subsidize the paper with inheritance money that 's just about gone , declined . He wanted the Light to stay family owned and not become some glorified advertising rag . After meeting several times with Plotkin , a 36-year-old former Monterey County prosecutor with a master 's in journalism from Columbia , Mitchell was satisfied the Light would remain " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turnaround plans <p> Plotkin , a freelance writer whose work has appeared in the New York Times , the Jerusalem Post , the New York Observer and elsewhere , had moved to Bolinas earlier this year with his wife and young son . He quickly learned about the Light . " It had perhaps the best reputation of any small paper in the country , " said Plotkin , a voluble chap whose frustrating experience as an intern at the Miami Herald , where his enterprising approach to stories was discouraged , turned him off to corporate journalism . He was jazzed by the challenge of publishing his own paper and having his say . " I thought it would be a whole lot of fun . It certainly was n't to purchase a money-losing small business , " added Plotkin , who 's writing a weekly column , taking pictures , directing coverage and trying to improve the finances . <p> He plans to solicit more ads from merchants beyond the hills of West Marin , in Fairfax , Mill Valley and Petaluma , where the locals have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling those freelancers and vendors who want more money now that ol ' Dave is gone  --  including the paper 's Point Reyes Station landlord , who wants to double the rent  --  to let him right the business first . <p> Editorially , Plotkin , who talks of creating a more literary paper , plans to continue covering local issues , but not to the exclusion of the outside world . He does n't share Mitchell 's view that if a tidal wave were to hit San Rafael , the Light would only cover it if somebody from West Marin got killed . <p> " I want this to have the sophistication of the Economist , to be written with as much flair as the New York Observer , to cover as much a sense of place as the Talk of the Town section of the New Yorker , " Plotkin said . He 's thinking about starting a nonprofit foundation , funded by the locals , to pay for a full-time investigative or environmental reporter . <p> There are no plans to change the Light 's much-loved Sheriff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A resident at 6:15 a.m . July 12 complained that a man aged 35 to 40 was bathing in a creek , cleaning his clothes in the creek , and urinating in the creek  --  presumably in that order . " <p> Plotkin , who 's from San Diego , knows locals are concerned the Light might lose some of its folksy quality , but " I 'm not going to try to emulate folksiness , " he said . " I 'm not a folksy guy . I have to be true to my own editorial judgments . " <p> People around Point Reyes Station are giving the new guy a chance and waiting to see what he does with the paper . <p> Opinions vary <p> " I love Dave Mitchell and I love the Point Reyes Light . He cared about the community and really made it a community in his paper , " said Kathy Runnion , a Point Reyes Station postal clerk who runs Planned Ferrelhood , which finds homes for feral cats . " I 'm sure Mr. Plotkin is going to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Eugene Rojan pulled his mail from his post office box and offered his assessment of the Light under Mitchell 's stewardship : " Yellow journalism , " said Rojan , an engineering geologist who has disagreed with Mitchell on environmental issues and said the editor once " distorted " his comments in a story about soil erosion . <p> Mitchell does n't recall the story with Rojan , but he can take the heat . " After each issue came out , I 'd walk down the street and see who was mad at me this week , " Mitchell said . He 'll miss leading the charge on a story that matters to him , but not all the meetings . <p> The Synanon expose brought the most acclaim to the Light , which won scores of awards , but " probably the most important thing we 've done , that I would take the most pride in , is helping the Mexican immigrants here become part of the mainstream , " Mitchell said . He covered the new arrivals in the context of previous waves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino , from the Azores  --  and sent reporters to those places and Mexico to tell the story . <p> Mitchell thinks Plotkin has the brains and energy to keep the Light alive . He likes what the new man has been doing so far but hopes the page design improves . <p> " One thing that gives me confidence is that the citizens of West Marin know what they want in a newspaper , " he said . " And if you 're not givin ' it to ' em , they 'll let you know .
