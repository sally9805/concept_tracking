Fire Ice A Novel from the NUMA Files By Clive Cussler with Paul Kemprecos G. P. Putnam 's Sons Off the Maine Coast , the Present LEROY JENKINS WAS hauling in a barnacle-encrusted lobster trap aboard his boat , The Kestrel , when he looked up and saw the giant ship on the horizon . He gingerly extracted a fat pair of angry crustaceans from the trap , pegged the claws and tossed the lobsters into a holding tank , then he rebaited the trap with a fish head , pushed the wire cage over the side and went into the pilothouse for his binoculars . He peered through the lenses and silently mouthed the word " Wow ! " The ship was huge . Jenkins examined the vessel from stem to stern with an expert eye . Before retiring to take up lobster-fishing , he had taught oceanography for years at the University of Maine , and he had spent many summer breaks on survey shipsbut this vessel was like nothing he had ever seen . He estimated its length at about six hundred feet . Derricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some sort of ocean mining or exploration vessel . He watched until the ship vanished from sight , then went back to pull the rest of the string of pots . Jenkins was a tall , rangy man in his sixties , whose rugged features mirrored the rockbound coast of his native Maine . A smile crossed his deeply tanned face as he hauled in the last trap . It had been an exceptionally good day . He had found the honey hole by accident a couple of months earlier . The spot produced an endless supply of lobsters , and he kept coming back even though he had to go farther from land than normal . Fortunately , his thirty-six-foot wooden boat was seaworthy even with a full load . Setting a course for land , he put the boat on autopilot and went below to reward himself with what they used to call a Dagwood sandwich when he was a kid . He had just layered in another slice of baloney on top of the pile of ham , cheese and salami when he heard a muffled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to come from below . The boat shuddered so violently the jars of mustard and mayonnaise rolled off the counter . Jenkins tossed his knife in the sink and sprang up to the deck . He wondered if the propeller had broken off or if he had hit a floating log , but nothing seemed amiss . The sea was calm and almost flat . Earlier , the blue surface had reminded him of a Rothko canvas . The boat had stopped vibrating , and he took a wondering look around , then , shrugging , went below . He finished making his sandwich , cleaned up and went out on the deck to eat . Noticing a couple of lobster traps that had shifted , he secured them with a line , then as he stepped back into the wheelhouse , he experienced a sudden unpleasant stomach-sinking sensation , as if someone had pushed the Up button in a fast elevator . He grabbed onto the mechanical hauler to keep his footing . The boat plunged , then levitated again , higher this time , plummeted once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sea , where it rocked violently from side to side . After a few minutes , the motion stopped and the boat stabilized , and Jenkins saw a flickering movement in the distance . Retrieving his binoculars from the wheelhouse , he swept the sea , and as he adjusted the focus ring , he saw three dark furrows extending from north to south . The ranks of waves were moving in the direction of the coast . A long-dormant alarm bell clanged in his head . It ca n't be . His mind raced back to that July day in 1998 off the coast of Papua New Guinea . He had been on a ship , making a survey , when there had been a mysterious explosion and the seismic instruments had gone crazy , indicating a disturbance on the seafloor . Recognizing the symptoms of a tsunami , the scientists aboard the ship had tried to warn the coast , but many of the villages had no communication . The huge waves had flattened the villages like a giant steamroller . The destruction was horrifying . Jenkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of crocodiles preying on the dead . The radio crackled with a chorus of hard-edged Maine accents as fishermen set the airways abuzz . " Whoa ! " said a voice Jenkins recognized as that of his neighbor , Elwood Smalley . " Hear that big boomer ? " " Sounded like a jet fighter , only underwater , " another fisherman said . " Anyone else feel those big seas ? " said a third man . " Yup , " replied a laconic veteran lobsterman named Homer Gudgeon . " Thought for a time there I was on a roller coaster ! " Jenkins barely heard the other voices chiming in . He dug a pocket calculator out of a drawer , estimated the time between the waves and their height , did some quick calculations and glanced with disbelief at the numbers . Then he picked up the cell phone he used when he did n't want personal messages to go over the marine channel and punched out a number . The gravelly voice of Charlie Howes , Rocky Cove 's police chief , came on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " In my cruiser on my way to the station , Roy . You calling to crow about whippin ' me at chess last night ? " " Another time , " Jenkins said . " I 'm east of Rocky Point . Look , Charlie , we do n't have much time . There 's a big wave heading right toward town . " He heard a dry chuckle at the other end . " Hell , Roy , " the chief said , " town like ours on the water is bound to get lots of waves . " " Not like this one . You 've got to evacuate the people from near the harbor , especially the new motel . " Jenkins thought the phone had gone dead . Then came Charlie Howe 's famous guffaw . " I did n't know today was April Fool 's . " " Charlie , this is no joke , " Jenkins said in exasperation . " That wave is going to slam into the harbor . I do n't know how strong it will be , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in its path . " The chief laughed again . " Hell , some people would be real happy to see the Harbor View washed into the sea . " The two-story edifice that extended into the harbor on stilts had been a source of controversy for months . It had gone up only after a bitter fight , an expensive lawsuit filed by the developers and what many suspected were bribes to officials . " They 're going to get their wish , but you 've got to get the guests out first . " " Hell , Roy , there must be a hundred people staying there . I ca n't roust them out for no reason . I 'll lose my job . Even worse , I 'll be a laughingstock . " Jenkins checked his watch and cursed under his breath . He had n't wanted to panic the chief , but he had reached the end of his self-control . " Goddamnit , you old fool ! How will you feel if a hundred people die because you 're afraid of being laughed at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy ? " " You know what I did before I took up lobstering . " " Yeah , you were a professor at the university up at Orono . " " That 's right . I headed up the Oceanography Department . We studied wave action . You 've heard of the Perfect Storm ? You 've got the perfect tidal wave heading your way . I calculate it will hit in twenty-five minutes . I do n't care what you tell those motel people . Tell them there 's a gas leak , a bomb threat , anything . Just get them out and to higher ground . And do it now . " " Okay , Roy . Okay . " " Is there anything open on Main Street ? " " Coffee shop . Jacoby kid is on the night shift . I 'll have him swing by , then check out the fish pier . " " Make sure everybody is out of the area in fifteen minutes . That goes for you and Ed Jacoby . " " Will do . Thanks , Roy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy with tension . He pictured Rocky Point in his mind . The town of twelve hundred was built like the seats in an amphitheater , its houses clustered on the side of a small hill overlooking the roughly circular harbor . The harbor was relatively sheltered , but the town 's inhabitants had learned after a couple of hurricane-driven storm surges to build back from the water . The old brick maritime buildings on the main street bordering the harbor had been given over to shops and restaurants that served tourists . The fish pier and the motel dominated the harbor . Jenkins cranked up the throttle and prayed that his warning had arrived in time . CHIEF Howes immediately regretted agreeing to Roy 's urgent pleas , and was overcome by a numbing sense of uncertainty . Damned if he did , damned if he did n't . He 'd known Jenkins since they were kids and Roy was the smartest one in class . He had never known him to fail as a friend . Still . Oh hell , he was near retirement anyhow . Howes switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smoky screech of tires , roared toward the waterfront . While he drove the short distance , he got the deputy on the radio and told him to clear out the coffee shop then to go along Main Street with his PA system blasting , warning people to get to high ground . The chief knew the diurnal rhythms of his town : who would be up , who would be walking a dog . Luckily , most businesses did n't open before ten . The motel was another story . Howes pulled over two empty buses on their way to pick up schoolchildren and told the drivers to follow him . The cruiser squealed to a stop beneath the motel 's canopy , and the chief huffed his way to the front door . Howes had been on the fence about the motel . It would spoil the integrity of the harbor , but it might bring in jobs for locals ; not everyone in town wanted to be a fisherman . On the other hand , he did n't like the way the project was rammed through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure there had been bribes at town hall . The developer was a local named Jack Shrager , an unprincipled land raper who was building condos along the river that ran off the harbor , further despoiling the town 's quiet beauty . Shrager never did hire locals , preferring foreigners who worked long and cheap . The desk clerk , a young Jamaican , looked up with a startled expression on his thin , dark face as the chief burst into the lobby and shouted : " Get everyone out of the motel ! This is an emergency ! " " What 's the problem , mon ? " " I 've been told there 's a bomb here . " The desk clerk gulped . Then he got on the switchboard and began to call rooms . " You 've got ten minutes , " Howes emphasized . " There are buses waiting in front . Get everyone out , including yourself . Tell anyone who refuses that the police will arrest them . " The chief strode down the nearest hallway and pounded on doors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ten minutes , " he yelled at the sleepy faces that peered out . " There has been a bomb threat . Do n't stop to gather your belongings . " He repeated the message until he was hoarse . The hallways filled with people in bathrobes and pajamas or with blankets wrapped around them . A swarthy man with an unpleasant scowl on his face stepped from one room . " What the hell is going on ? " Jack Shrager demanded . Howes swallowed hard . " There 's been a bomb threat , Jack . You 've got to get out . " A young blond woman poked her head out of the room . " What 's wrong , babe ? " " There 's a bomb in the motel , " the chief said , becoming more specific . The woman 's face went pale and she stepped into the hallway . She was still in her silk bathrobe . Shrager tried to hold her , but she pulled away . " I 'm not staying here , " she said . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Howes shook his head in frustration , then guided the woman by the arm , joining the throng heading for the front door . He saw the buses were almost filled and yelled at the drivers . " Get out of here in five minutes . Drive to the highest hill in town . " He slid behind the wheel of his cruiser and drove to the fish pier . The deputy was arguing with three fishermen . Howes saw what was happening and yelled out the window , " Get your asses into those trucks and go to the top of Hill Street or you 'll be arrested . " " What the hell is going on , Charlie ? " Howes lowered his voice . " Look , Buck , you know me . Just do as I say and I 'll explain later . " The fisherman nodded , then he and the others got into their pickups . Howes told his deputy to follow them and made one last sweep along the fish pier , where he picked up an elderly man who sorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he scoured Main Street , saw that it was quiet and headed for the top of Hill Street . Some of the people who stood shivering in the cool air of morning shouted at him . Howes ignored their insults , got out of his cruiser and walked partway down the steep hill that led down toward the harbor . Now that the adrenaline rush was over , he felt weak-kneed . Nothing . He checked his watch . Five minutes came and went . And so did his dreams of a peaceful retirement on a police pension . I 'm dead , he thought , sweating despite the coolness . Then he saw the sea rise above the horizon and heard what sounded like distant thunder . The townspeople stopped shouting . A darkness loomed out near the channel entrance and the harbor emptied outhe could actually see bottombut the phenomenon lasted only a few seconds . The water roared back in with a noise like a 747 taking off , and the sea lifted the moored fishing boats as if they were toys . It was reinforced by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one before . They surged over the shore . When they receded , the motel and the fish pier had vanished . THE Rocky Point that Jenkins returned to was far different from the one he had left that morning . The boats moored in the harbor were jumbled together along the shore in a tangled heap of wood and fiberglass . Smaller craft had been thrown up onto Main Street . Shop windows were smashed as if by a gang of vandals . The water was littered with debris and seaweed , and a sulfuric smell of sea bottom mixed with the odor of dead fish . The motel had vanished . Only pilings remained of the fish pier , although the sturdy concrete bulkhead showed no sign of damage . Jenkins pointed his boat toward a figure waving his arms on the bulkhead . Chief Howes grabbed the mooring lines and tied them off , then he stepped aboard . " Anybody hurt ? " Jenkins said , his eyes sweeping the harbor and town . " Jack Shrager was killed . He 's the only one as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motel . " " Thanks for believing me . Sorry I called you an old fool . " The chief puffed his cheeks out . " That 's what I would have been if I 'd sat on my ass and done nothing . " " Tell me what you saw , " Jenkins said , the scientist reasserting itself over the Samaritan . Howes laid out the details . " We were standing at the top of Hill Street . Sounded and looked like a thunderstorm , then the harbor emptied out like a kid pulling the plug in a bathtub . I could actually see bottom . That only lasted a few seconds before the water roared in like a jet plane . " " That 's an apt comparison . On the open ocean , a tsunami can go six hundred miles an hour . " " That 's fast ! " the chief said . " Luckily , it slows down as it approaches land and hits shallower water . But the wave energy does n't diminish with the speed . " " It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water fifty feet high . This was more like a wave surge . I counted three of them , each bigger than the last . Thirty feet , maybe . They whacked the motel and pier and flooded Main Street . " He shrugged . " I know you 're a professor , Roy , but how exactly did you know this was going to happen ? " " I 've seen it before off New Guinea . We were doing some research when an undersea slide generated a tsunami thirty to sixty feet tall , and a series of waves lifted our boat off the water just like what I felt today . The people were warned and many made it to high ground when the waves hit , but even so , more than two thousand people were lost . " The chief gulped . " That 's more than live in this town . " He pondered the professor 's words . " You think that an earthquake caused this mess ? I thought that was something that happened in the Pacific . " " Normally , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared out to sea . " This is absolutely incomprehensible . " " I 'll tell you something else that 's going to be hard to figure . How am I going to explain that I evacuated the motel for a bomb scare ? " " Do you think anyone will care at this point ? " Chief Howes surveyed the town and the crowds of people cautiously making their way down the hill to the harbor and shook his head . " No , " he said . " I do n't guess they will . "
