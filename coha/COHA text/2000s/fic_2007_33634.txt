Chapter One Venture I 'm young , attractive , and intelligent , so why am I lying here with this guy when I do n't even love him ? It 's an early November morning and C-SPAN is blasting from the other room . I 'm annoyed . I was getting real tired of the casualness of our relationship . I tried to cover my naked body with the silk sheet thrown across the bed . I moved carefully so Mr. Three Times in One Night would n't wake up and want to go another round . Troy Evans and I had been seeing each other intimately , with no strings attached , for seven months . Neither of us wanted any commitment other than our jobs . We were coworkers and a darn good team , both on the job and under the covers . He was hitting thirty-three and I was almost twenty-eight . However , I now wanted more than a fling . I did n't know what it was I was chasing , but I did know Troy was n't the answer . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upholding justice was my life 's work . Ever since my alcoholic dad left my mother , little sister , and me when I was ten years old , I felt I had to protect the three of us . I was the oldest , so I had to take care of my family . My mother raised us in church , so the only father I knew was a Heavenly Father , and most times I wondered if He was even there . You know , when Mama could n't pay the rent , when we had no food , or when I wore shoes to school that were way too small because we had no money for new ones . Where was God when my mother could n't get folks in our small church to help her ? Out of desperation she turned to a local drug dealer for a job . It destroyed her life , and not having her there for me sent me searching for love in all the wrong places . So here I am with Troy . Troy and I found our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was early April , and I 'd been on Troy 's team for eighteen months . It was my tenth assignment since coming out of training-I had been an agent for almost five years . We were working a money-laundering case . We 'd tracked our suspect , Rudy Roberts , from our hometown and headquarters in D.C. to New York City . Troy , another agent , and I were in a surveillance van , following Roberts in a cab . Suddenly the yellow taxi pulled over and Roberts got out , smiled at our van , and started walking briskly down the sidewalk . Very annoyed that the guy had somehow found us out , Troy ordered , " You guys stay in the vehicle and follow me-I 'm tailing Roberts . " He hurled out so fast that he did n't take a radio . When Roberts ducked down a dark alley , Troy followed him . We could n't see either of them . After waiting a few minutes , panic began to set in . I opened the van door . The other agent yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't even see him now , " I rationalized . " What if he 's in trouble ? " I ducked down that same blind alley and heard a scuffle . With my gun drawn , I crept up the sidewall behind a green , industrial Dumpster . Suddenly the struggle ended . Roberts laughed . " You 've nothing on me . Get ready to die . " Taking a deep breath for courage , I walked a few paces more and saw Roberts on top of my case leader , his gun in Troy 's face . I identified myself by saying , " Freeze-FBI ! " When he cocked his gun , I shot mine on impulse . After the smoke cleared , I realized I had shot a man for the very first time in my life . I suddenly felt this awful guilt . Although I 'd spent countless hours at the firing range , I was not prepared for the emotional reaction that I would have when I was actually in that situation . " What have I done ? " I mumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm weapon from my hands . " If you had n't shot him , he would have killed me . I 'm forever grateful-and glad you disobeyed my order and got out of that van . " He smiled . After Internal Affairs investigated for days , they concluded I did the only thing I could . Still , I was mentally drained and shaken . After the shooting I could n't handle my emotions in the field , so my boss , Agent Thomas Hunter , decided to keep me chained to my desk , reviewing cases and talking to confidential sources , gathering evidence until he thought I was ready to get back out there . Troy understood my disappointment . Not too long after I was benched , he asked to buy me a late meal . Since the shooting , I did n't like being alone at night , so I accepted his offer . We went to a local steak house and ate and drank for several hours . Later , Troy saw me to my door . I was slightly inebriated and he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door for me with my keys but did n't say good night . Troy looked deep into my eyes that hazy April night and told me I was beautiful and sexy . I had n't heard that from a man in too long . I pulled him close to me and kissed him deeply . I wanted to be found attractive again by a man . It had been years since I 'd felt the warm hands of a strong man all over my body . No part of me hesitated as I slipped into his arms . Though Troy made it clear he did n't want anything serious , that was the first of many wonderful , sensual nights that we would spend together . Law enforcement was n't the kind of career that lent itself to settling down . The women Troy had dated before me did n't understand that . The long hours and spur of the moment out of town trips for weeks at a time without a decent night off were n't the kind of thing most women could deal with . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled some of the biggest cases in the world . Romance came second to adventure for Troy . At first , that was n't high on my priority list , either , so we made a good match . We 'd get together whenever we felt like keeping each other 's bed warm . Other than that , neither of us had any expectations . Months ago that was okay , but now , lying next to him , I was suddenly sick of the arrangement . As I gazed at his muscular body , toffee-colored skin , and handsome face , I thought maybe , just maybe , I was ready for more than just casual sex with no commitment . Something inside made me see this as wrong . Was it the Holy Spirit at work ? Stepping out of bed , I hurried to the bathroom . It was almost two A.M. Spending the night this time was not an option . I had too much going on inside me . Not only was I starting to hate our no-strings-attached relationship , I was also starting to despise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our unit worked closely with the Drug Enforcement Agency , following seedy characters from state to state until we finally got enough evidence for an arrest . But each time I saw a major drug dealer get off on a technicality , it made me want another job . And watching others work on cases in the field while I was still tied to a desk did n't help matters any . Standing at the sink , I stared at my dim reflection in the mirror . Troy often complimented me on my smooth brown complexion and warm , hazel eyes . I was just glad my eyelashes were long and thick so I did n't have to use mascara . I never wore much makeup , preferring to rely on my own natural , God-given attributes . Glamour and guns only mixed in the movies . I really needed to redo my highlights , though . I ran my fingers through my short hair and thought about the fine man in the next room . Suddenly my insides started churning . One part of me wondered why I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed with him and get some more loving . Or maybe I needed some space . It seems like just yesterday that my first and only love , Max Cross , broke my heart . Max and I dated all four years at Baylor . I majored in Criminal Justice and he was a Business major . We met at a freshman party and were inseparable from then on . He was an exceptionally sexy man with creamy clay skin and hazel-brown eyes that made me melt . I thought we 'd get married , and I was devastated when we broke up . I should n't have told him I was pregnant . The abortion broke my heart-and our relationship . To get over that pain , I took on more shifts at my job at a local restaurant , Texan Grill , where I 'd been working to earn money to send back to my mother and sister . It had n't been more than three months before the married manager , Damien , and I began having an affair . I knew it was n't right . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't been treated like that before . He bought me things and took me on trips . I did n't know what he told his wife and did n't care until the day she caught us in the act . Over the next six months , I applied and got accepted into a training program for the Federal Bureau of Investigation . It 's been less than six years . After doing well on other assignments and saving Agent Evans 's life , I now enjoyed the respect of my colleagues . They started calling me " the woman with everything going on . " It was true . I was good-looking , well put-together . Whatever I wore always suited me . And I 'd never had a problem attracting a man . But what difference did all that really make ? I was n't happy . There had to be more to this life than survival . I felt empty and needed to be filled by something everlasting , but how could I get that . The only thing I knew was that I had to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached to turn on the faucet . That 's when I saw the condom Troy and I had used just hours before . The shriveled-up thing was n't balled up in the wastebasket , but curled up on the sink , positioned as if it had been inspected . " What the ... ? " I screeched out , completely lost in anger as I realized what must have happened . Troy 's voice came suddenly from the other room . " You got a problem ? " " Yes , " I snapped . " What is this ? " He made his way to the bathroom , and eyed the condom beside me . " Would you calm down , baby . I 'm sure it 's no big deal . " " Troy , do n't play . Did this burst ? " " I ... I do n't know . I 'm not sure . " " What do you mean , you 're not sure . You 're a grown man , Troy . " Troy scanned my naked body with hungry eyes and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he get that I was pissed ? " I can open another one , " he whispered . " It 'll only take a second for me to put it on . " " You knew the condom broke , did n't you ? " I said , scanning his guilty face and ignoring his new erection . " I ca n't have a baby and work in the FBI ! " " Do n't even sweat that . You 're cool . I 'm over thirty . I 've been sexually active since my teens . I 've been with lots of women and never had any children . Trust me , it 'll be okay . I know what I 'm doing . " He tried to lead me back to bed , but I shoved him out of the bathroom and closed the door in his face . See ? I chastised myself . That 's why I should n't be doing this . Troy 's frustrated voice filtered through the door . " Shut me out , then . I 'm gon na fix me something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry . I know you 're fine . " His confidence made my skin crawl . When I heard him storm away , I took the only clean washcloth in the place from under the sink and began to freshen up . Emotions started to bubble up . I needed help . I needed something different . I needed not to be in this casual sex relationship . Deep down , I felt there was only One that could fix this , so I looked up at the ceiling and said , " God , You got ta know this is not a good time for me . " I shook my head . What was I doin ' ? He would n't listen to me . I 'm sure He gave up on me a while ago . But something-sheer desperation-spurred me to get down on my knees and continue . " Well , if You 're still in the forgiving business , I need help . There 's got to be more to this life than living and dying . There has to be more than just trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , help me see it . " My mom used to make us pray every night , trying to lift our spirits . But ever since I had the abortion after the breakup with Max , I 'd strayed away from God . Somehow I just felt unworthy of His love . But at that moment in Troy 's bathroom , I needed to feel close to Him . I emerged from Troy 's bedroom fully dressed and headed to gather my stuff . Troy heard my steps and caught my arm before I picked up my bag . He pulled me to the television in the living room . " Can you believe this ? " he raged . A news conference was being held on C-SPAN . A U.S. senator , the Reverend Steven Stokes , was addressing the nation from Atlanta , Georgia . For a brief second , I forgot that I had planned to head to my own apartment . " Did he say he 's running for president ? " I asked . " Yeah , " Troy confirmed . I shrugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , recovering from shock . " Please ! I do n't care who he is . Jackson 's , Chisholm 's , and Sharpton 's poor showings at the polls over the years should be enough to prove this nation ai n't ready for a black president . " " I do n't know , " I said , lowering myself onto the couch . " That was years ago . Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice have since held cabinet posts-they 've changed America 's outlook about having a black person in politics . Maybe the nation is ready . " " Yeah , right , " Troy dismissed . The Reverend 's wife , a beige-skinned , petite lady , strode up to her husband with a bright , confident smile . She wore a navy suit , tea-length with a rounded white collar pressed to perfection . Pearl accessories added a touch of elegance . I admired her style . Their three children followed , all seemingly in their twenties or early thirties . The eldest , Steven Jr. , had a young family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye told me this guy was probably a bit of a troublemaker . The daughter , Savannah , was a younger version of her mom . She looked to be in her early twenties . She walked up to her dad , took his arm , and gave him an adoring smile . The middle child , Sebastian , had a muscular build that made me do a double take . He wore dark-rimmed glasses and a charcoal-colored suit and tie that made him look like an overpriced lawyer . I did n't know them personally , but the Stokeses had been in the spotlight lately . The press loved talking about how much the family was putting Georgia on the map . I had seen headlines touting the way their community involvement had helped decrease the number of homeless people , increase the number of corporate headquarters in Georgia , and raise the state 's literacy rate . I 'd always felt that though we had n't had a black president yet , we needed more politicians to keep reaching for it . And what better candidate than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a church . Plus , I could get behind someone who wanted to work for America as president and not just push his own agenda . Reverend Stokes seemed like that type of person . " They seem like the real deal , " I said . " Whatever , " Troy grumbled , heading into the kitchen . " Wait ' til the press starts eating them up . All their dirty laundry will be out there . " Troy poured himself a shot of gin . " White folks do n't want a brother in the White House . They 're afraid we 'll get in there and make our own rules . " Troy laughed to himself . " White people are n't the only ones who vote . You 'll vote for him , wo n't you ? " Troy chugged his drink . " I do n't know anything about the man . " " He 's black and he 's a Democrat . Plus , he has a good track record , " I said , angry at his stubbornness . " What else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ever meet them you 'll probably see they are n't that impressive . I bet those smiles are only on the surface . Most politicians I come across are phony . " " All of them ca n't be bad , " I said , gathering my stuff . " I imagine their life is pretty wonderful . " " Then I suggest you apply for the Secret Service temp job , guard them for a while , and find out all their dirty little secrets . Then you 'll see that the rosy picture you 're talking about is n't so perfect . " I spotted my toothbrush and makeup case and stuffed them into my Gucci overnight bag . Walking back to the living room , I said , " Temp job ? What are you talking about ? " " It was posted through the inner office e-mail system . Something about because it 's election time , the Secret Service needs bodies to help them cover the presidential candidates , " Troy said before kissing me on the cheek and opening his apartment door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised my eyebrow , nodded my head , and thought , Good riddance , Mr. Evans . And maybe I should look into that temp job . It was time for a new venture .
