Idaho , May 1915 <p> The Torpedo Runabout cut the corner from Shenandoah Street onto Wallula Street , driving over two of the boarding house 's rose bushes in the process . The automobile then weaved dangerously close to Guinevere Arlington 's white picket fence . <p> With a gasp , Gwen jumped up from the porch swing . <p> In the nick of time , the Model T Ford veered away from her fence , avoiding disaster . <p> " Hello , ladies . " The driver tipped his hat to Gwen and her sister as if nothing was amiss . <p> " And there goes our next mayor . " Cleo shook her head and cast a look of despair at Gwen . " Ten o'clock in the morning and drunk as a skunk . Can you imagine him holding the reins of government ? " <p> " No , I ca n't . " Gwen sank onto the porch swing again . " Hiram Tattersall is a fool , not to mention his penchant for strong spirits . " <p> Cleo crossed one booted foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you run for office , Gwennie ? Not a reason in the world you could n't do it . " <p> " Me ? " Gwen looked at her twin in disbelief . <p> " Of course you . There 's nothing in the law that says a woman ca n't be the mayor of our fair town . You 're a nicer person than Mayor Hopkins , the old coot - " <p> " Cleo . Do n't be unkind . " <p> " I 'm sorry . I know he 's sick or we would n't be having this special election . But he has n't done a single , solitary thing of worth while he 's been mayor , and everybody knows Tattersall will be an even worse mayor than Hopkins . " <p> " I have no qualifications for political office . " <p> " And Tattersall does ? You 'd do a better job than Hopkins and Tattersall put together . Folks like you . " Cleo winked . " Especially the men , pretty as you are . " <p> Gwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't want to be elected for my appearance . " <p> " So do n't let that be why . You got that fancy education burning to be put to use . Why not let folks see you 're as full of information as a mail-order catalog ? " <p> It was a ridiculous idea . Gwen had no intention of running for mayor . She was content giving piano lessons to the children of Bethlehem Springs and writing her columns for the local newspaper . <p> Cleo drank the last of her iced tea , set the glass on the porch floor , and pushed off from the railing . " I 'd best get back to the ranch . I 've got a load of chores still to be done . " She slapped her floppy-brimmed hat onto her head , covering her mop of short , strawberry-blonde curls . " You 'd be doing this town a favor if you were its mayor . We could use a little forward thinking , if you ask me . " <p> Gwen smiled as she rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as forward thinking as you . " <p> " Ha ! " <p> Gwen followed her sister off the porch and around to the back of the house where Cleo 's pinto was tethered to a post . Cleo stopped long enough to give Gwen a hug and a kiss on the cheek , then untied her horse , grasped the saddle horn , and swung into the seat . " You think about it , Gwennie . I 'm telling you . It 's the right thing to do . You pray and see if the Lord does n't agree with me . " With a tug on the brim of her hat , she twirled her horse away and cantered down the street . <p> Gwen shook her head . Cleo could come up with the most outlandish ideas . Imagine : Gwen Arlington , mayor of Bethlehem Springs . It was preposterous . Not that she did n't believe women should serve in public office . She did , and she was glad she lived in a state where women had the right to vote . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she returned to the front porch and settled onto the cushioned seat of the swing , giving a little push with her feet to start it in motion . <p> The air smelled of fresh-turned earth , green grass , and flowers in bloom . The mountains of southern Idaho were enjoying warm weather , although snow could be seen on the highest peaks to the north and east of Bethlehem Springs . <p> Gwen loved this small town . She loved her neighbors , the children who came for lessons , the women in her church sewing circle . She loved the long , narrow valley , the river that flowed through it , and the tree-covered mountains that overlooked it all . She loved the sense of the old West and the new century that surrounded her , horses and automobiles , outhouses and indoor plumbing , wood-burning stoves and electric lights . <p> Her mother , Elizabeth Arlington , had n't felt the same about Idaho . She despised everything about it , so much so that after four years of marriage , she 'd left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey , taking two-year-old Gwen with her . <p> " Be thankful , Guinevere , " her mother said on many an occasion over the years , " that your father allowed you to come with me . We 're alike , you and I. We need society and fine culture . Think of the advantages you 've had that poor Cleopatra has gone without . The opera and the theater . Fine schooling . You would never be suited to live in that backwater town where your father chose to settle . " <p> But her mother was wrong . Bethlehem Springs did suit Gwen - a truth she discovered soon after her arrival in Idaho seven years before . At the age of twenty-one , and with the reluctant blessing of her mother , she had come to Idaho to meet the father and sister she could n't remember . She had n't intended to stay , but in a few short weeks she 'd fallen in love with the area . Her heart felt at home here as it never had in New Jersey . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethlehem Springs if Hiram Tattersall became its mayor ? He would n't try to better their schools or improve roads or help those who had lost jobs due to mine closings . And if the governor of the state succeeded in passing Prohibition in Idaho , as many thought he would , Tattersall would n't enforce it in Bethlehem Springs . She was convinced of that . <p> I would do a better job than he would . <p> But of course she had no intention of running for mayor . <p> No intention whatsoever . <p> * * * <p> Morgan McKinley wanted nothing more than to punch that artificial smile off Harrison Carter 's face . <p> " You 'll have to wait until after the election , Mr. McKinley . I 'm sorry . The new mayor and the county commissioners must be in agreement on these matters . " <p> Before Morgan did something he would regret - something that would get him tossed into the jail one floor below - he bid a hasty farewell and left the commissioner 's chambers . When he exited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw a calming breath . <p> Harrison Carter had delayed this decision for personal reasons , not for anything to do with an election . Several times over the past year , the commissioner had offered to buy the land where New Hope was being built . If he thought these delays would change Morgan 's mind about selling , he was in for a big disappointment . <p> With a grunt of frustration , he turned and headed for his automobile , parked on the west side of the sandstone building . Fagan Doyle , Morgan 's business manager and good friend , leaned against the back of the car , his pipe clenched between his teeth . <p> " Well ? " Fagan cocked an eyebrow . <p> Morgan shook his head . <p> " Then I 'll be asking what it is you mean to do about it ? " <p> " I do n't know yet . " <p> Morgan got behind the wheel of the Model T while Fagan moved to the crank . Once the engine started , Fagan slid into the passenger seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed Main Street out to the main road , thankful his friend did n't ask more questions . He needed to think . <p> Occasional complications and delays were expected when a man undertook a large building project , but this felt different . Morgan had half expected Harrison to ask for money under the table , but that had n't happened . Just as well since Morgan was n't the sort who bribed public officials . Nor allowed himself to be blackmailed by them . Not under any circumstance . <p> Twenty minutes later , the touring car arrived on the grounds of what would one day be a unique resort - the New Hope Health Spa . The main lodge had taken shape at the upper end of the compound . Morgan no longer needed to study the architectural renderings to imagine what it would look like when finished . <p> He wished his mother had lived to see it . This spa had been her dream before it became his . <p> Before the automobile rolled to a stop , the site foreman , Christopher Vance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem . " <p> Another one ? " What is it ? " <p> " The dam on Crow 's Creek . It 's leaking . I 'm not sure it 'll hold . I 've got a crew up there now working on it . " <p> Morgan 's gaze shifted toward the narrow road at the east end of the compound . About a mile up they 'd built the dam that would provide and control the cold water used in conjunction with the natural hot water from the springs . <p> " I 'd better see it for myself . Hop in , " he said to the foreman , " and we 'll drive up there . " <p> If that dam broke , a good portion of the resort compound could end up covered in several inches of water . Not the end of the world , but it would stop construction until things dried out . Another delay . <p> " Somebody did this , Morgan , " Christopher said . " It 's no accident . " <p> He frowned at his foreman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . " <p> Why would anyone want to sabotage the dam ? It was deep into his property , and he had n't diverted water that was needed by anyone else . No farmers or ranchers were dependent upon the flow of Crow 's Creek . He 'd made sure of that . <p> Could Harrison Carter be behind it ? <p> * * * <p> On her way to the Daily Herald with her latest article , Gwen stopped by the mercantile to inquire about Helen Humphrey . The poor woman had suffered with severe back pain for more than two months , and nothing she 'd tried had relieved it . <p> " The doctors say rest is the only thing that 'll help , " Bert Humphrey told Gwen . " And even then they 're not sure she 'll ever be without pain . Maybe the health spa that fellow 's building will do her some good . Nothing else has . Not that we could afford it . Something that fancy 's bound to cost more than we could come up with . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have better news , Mr. Humphrey . But , no matter what it costs , do you really believe taking the waters would help her ? I 'm afraid I 'm somewhat skeptical . " <p> " I do n't know . I 'd try just about anything at this point . " <p> Gwen offered a sympathetic smile . " Please tell Helen I 'll make some of my chicken and dumplings and bring it over . " <p> He swept a hand over his balding head . " She has n't had much appetite , but I know we 'll be glad for it , all the same . " <p> " I 'll keep her in my prayers . " <p> " We 'd appreciate it . " <p> Gwen bid the proprietor a good day , then left the store . As she walked along Wallula Street toward the newspaper office , her thoughts remained on the resort . There were varying feelings in Bethlehem Springs about the construction of the spa ten miles to the north . Many people thought it would be good for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as carpenters and general laborers . Other townsfolk thought the resort would change Bethlehem Springs for the worse , bringing in too many outsiders . Of course , there were a few in town who thought the spa would fail , so what did it matter ? <p> Gwen did n't know what to believe . She 'd never frequented a spa , although she had gone with Cleo a few times to sit in one of the natural hot springs on their father 's ranch . Enjoyable , to be sure , but was it a cure for physical ailments ? For all she knew , McKinley was a snake oil salesman of the worst kind , offering a cure to the hopeless - a cure that did n't exist . <p> There was also the matter of McKinley being a newcomer to the area . No local had heard of him until he arrived in the area a year ago . And although the wealthy Easterner had purchased the old Hampstead home on Skyview Street , it sat empty . Folks said the new owner was at the resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only long enough to send a telegram , pick up his mail , and purchase supplies . Not once had he spent the night in town . <p> " The time I met him , he was genial enough , " Nathan Patterson , owner and editor of the Daily Herald , had said once . " A newspaper friend of mine from Boston says the McKinley family is among the wealthiest in America . Does n't it seem odd that he would end up here , of all places ? " <p> " Thinks himself too good for the likes of us , I gather . " That had been Edna Updike 's opinion - something Gwen 's neighbor never hesitated to share . " He does n't even go to church . A heathen , no doubt . " <p> " Not much mail ever , " Dedrik Finster , the postmaster , had said in Gwen 's presence just a week ago . " He is mystery , ja ? " <p> Arriving at the newspaper office , Gwen shook off thoughts of the resort and the mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said as she stepped through the doorway . <p> " Ah , there you are , Miss Arlington . I was wondering when you would have your column for me . What 's your story about this time ? " <p> " The expansion of educational opportunities for women in the past fifty years and the importance of women taking advantage of them . Did you know , Mr. Patterson , that there were only five women lawyers or notaries in 1870 but almost fifteen thousand by 1910 ? " <p> Nathan shook his head . " Not sure I think women should be lawyers . " <p> " Why not ? A woman does n't have an inferior mind . She is as able to grasp the written law as any man . Deborah was a judge in Israel , if you 'll recall . And if a woman is widowed , is n't it better that she have an education and a profession that will allow her to support herself and her children rather than to be dependent upon the generosity of relatives or her church ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But not in a man 's profession ? " She offered a smile , taking the bite out of her question . <p> " You have me there , Miss Arlington . " He chuckled . " There is certainly nothing inferior about your mind . " <p> " Thank you . " She held out the carefully penned pages . <p> Nathan took them . As he glanced down at some other papers on his desk , he muttered , " Wish I could say the same for our one and only candidate for mayor . Tattersall . " He growled in disgust . " I ca n't figure why no one else has stepped forward to run against him . The election will be here before we know it . " <p> Cleo 's words echoed in Gwen 's thoughts : " Why do n't you run for office , Gwennie ? " She ignored the shiver of excitement that raced up her spine and posed her sister 's question to the newspaperman . " Why do n't you run for office , Mr. Patterson ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better reporting the news than making it . " <p> " Not a reason in the world you could n't do it , " Cleo 's voice whispered in her head . <p> Gwen glanced at the pages in the editor 's hands . She 'd written the article to encourage women to step forward , to better themselves , to make a difference in the society in which they lived . Was it possible God had been speaking to her even as she wrote those words to other women ? <p> Softly , she said , " My sister thinks I should run . " <p> Nathan stared at her . <p> " It 's a silly notion , of course . " Her heart hammered and her pulse raced . " I told Cleo it was . " <p> Wordlessly , he leaned back in his chair , rubbing his chin with his right hand . " Silly ? " A long pause , then , " I 'm not so sure it is . " <p> " You 're not ? " Her throat felt parched . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman judge ? " He shot up from his chair , knuckles resting on the top of the desk . " Do it , Miss Arlington . Run for mayor . The newspaper will put its support behind your candidacy . " <p> " But Mr. Patterson , I 've never held public office before . Why would you support me ? " <p> " My gut tells me you would do what needs to be done . You 're articulate and well educated . You obviously are n't afraid to speak out when you see a problem the community needs to address . You 've done so often enough in your columns . " <p> She wished she had n't spoken . She wished she 'd kept her thoughts to herself . <p> " Do it , Miss Arlington . The town will be grateful . And I must admit it would give me plenty of interesting things to write about in the coming weeks . Never been a woman mayor that I know of . " He jotted a note on a slip of paper . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something if we were the first ? " <p> " I have n't said I 'll do it yet . " <p> " Think about what it 'll be like here if Tattersall 's elected . " <p> Gwen took a step back from his desk . " I ... I 'll want to pray about it and ... and talk to my father . " <p> " Of course . Of course . You do that . But I 'm telling you , Miss Arlington , you should do this . " <p> * * * <p> Fortunately , Christopher Vance 's worst fears were n't realized . The damage appeared less serious than first perceived . By late afternoon , the crew of men had stabilized the dam on Crow 's Creek . More permanent repairs would be undertaken in the morning . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
