Testing the fastest computers you can buy // In 1965 , Lyndon Baines Johnson sat in the Ovid Office , the Rolling Stones topped the charts with " Satisfaction , " and Intel co-founder Gordon Moore made an interesting observation . Moore figured out that each new chip contains roughly twice as much capacity as its predecessor , and it takes 18 to 24 months to release a new one . This is referred to as Moore 's Law and it continues to hold true to this day . To us , Moore 's Law means that today 's fastest PCs are tomorrow 's entry-level systems . So if you tuck this issue of POPULAR MECHANICS under your mattress , you can pull it out a year and a half from now and see what 's happening in the low-end computer market . But today is today , and this is a current snapshot of high-end personal computing technology . We put the call out to manufacturers around the country for their biggest , baddest , fastest personal computers . Two leading computer companies , IBM and Hewlett-Packard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both companies stated that they were unable to produce a system that would beat the technology of other systems competing in the race . What we ended up with were the following speed demons : Apple PowerMac G4 , Acer Aspire 6400 , Compaq Presario 59002 , Dell Dimension XPS , Falcon Northwest Mach V and the Gateway Select 850 . Note that the prices shown do not include monitor or speakers although these are discussed later . The Tests Different people do different things with their computers . So in coming up with our four tests , we tried to shoot for an accurate representation of what the typical PC might have to do in an average day . You can see the results in the charts on pages 86 and 87 . How do you interpret the results ? For consistency 's sake , we did all timings in seconds . A description of each test follows . However , there are a couple of points worth noting . First , the Compaq Presario was the speed champ in every test . This shows clearly that there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processor-two other systems had the same processor . It 's also interesting that despite its mere 450-MHz processor , the Apple G4 managed to come in third in the M test-although it came in last in all the others . Photoshop Filtering One common test of a PC 's speed is to have it apply a Photoshop filter to a digital photograph . For the uninitiated , Photoshop is the de facto standard digital image-editing pro gram from Adobe ( www. adobe.com ) . A filter is essentially a special efect that can be applied to a digital image . For our test , we scanned an 8 x 10 color photo at 200 dpi and saved it as a IFF . This resulted in approximately a 9MB file . Once the image was opened Photoshop 5.5 , we applied the built-in " watercolor " filter . M Ripping The process of converting any digital music file to the M format is called " ripping to M . " This often involves transferring songs from music CDs to the iI format , which is what we did for our test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then chose the 8 1/2-minute-long " Kashmir " to actually rip . To rip the track , we used N2M ( www.n2mp3.com ) . Although not the most popular software for this purpose , it 's the only one we found that offered both Windows and Mac versions . Database Indexing How often do you have to search your computer for one bit of information or another ? Because we do it often , we want a computer that can fly through searches like greased lightning . They have n't invented that computer yet , but we did this test anyway . We started with a database of 2400 e-mail messages exported from Microsoft Outlook . We im ported these into FileMaker Pro 5 ( www.filemaker.com ) , and then indexed the message bodies . The way database programs work , once the information is indexed , searches can be completed almost instantaneously . In other words , indexing the data is the timeconsuming part of completing a search . Voice-Recognition Training Finally , we decided to try something just a little far-out . If you 've ever used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it , you need to train it . This typically consists or reading text , which is known to the program , to the computer . The software records your reading and then spends as long as an hour comparing what you said to the words it knows were actually present in the text . For this , we turned to IBM 's ViaVoice Millennium Edition ( www. ibm.com ) . We chose to read parts one // Apply Photoshop 's Watercolor Filter , seconds // Train ViaVoice , seconds // Index 200 FileMaker Records , seconds // and two of Treasure Island . This represented about 40 minutes ' worth of reading . The Computers You 've read the specs . You 've compared the charts . But facts and figures tell only part of the story . How did we really feel about each of these systems ? * Acer Aspire 6400 ( www.acer america . com ) . This system has the slowest processor of all the Windows-compatible systems we looked at . However , when you look at the speed charts , you realize that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for reasons we ca n't fully explain , the Acer Aspire running a 733-MHz Pentium III processor beat the Gateway Select and its 850MHz Athlon processor on the speech-recognition training test . Another important point is that of all six systems , the Acer Aspire was by far the quietest . If it were n't for the sound of the disk reading and writing while you 're working , you might not realize the thing is on . Perhaps the most important spec for the Acer Aspire is the price tag . When you consider how little you give up in performance to how many hundreds of dollars you can save , the Acer Aspire easily represents the best value of the bunch . * Apple PowerMac G4 ( www.apple. com ) . Things change quickly in the computer world . Just as we had finished testing the PowerMac with its 450-MHz processor ( the model Apple chose to send us ) , the company announced the availability of a 500  --  MHz system . Without question , the PowerMac we tested was the sexiest-looking system . The translucent charcoal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the matching keyboard-all these combine for a visually stunning presentation . Of course , the PowerMac is n't just good looks . Considering the MHz disparity with the other sys- terns , the Mac performed quite nicely and actually beat three of five Windows systems in ripping " Kashmir " to M . And let 's face it , if you 're looking at a Mac , you 're probably more interested in the Mac 's legendary reliability and ease of use than getting the absolute fastest PC in town . // Rip 81/2-Minute Song Track To M , seconds // There is one minor feature we loved about the Mac . Getting inside the thing was as easy as flipping one lever and dropping down the hinged right panel of the case . Older Macs were criticized for being hard to upgrade . This one seems easier to upgrade than any Windows system we 've seen . The Mac was also the only system we saw that included a DVD-RAM ( not DVD-ROM ) drive . * Compaq Presario 59002 ( www.compaq.com ) . This was unquestionably the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note that when asked to send their fastest PCs , three companies , Compaq among them , sent systems based on 850-MHz versions of AMD 's Athlon processor . What 's even more interesting is that the Presario smoked every other system , including those using the same 850-MHz Athlon processor . The specs do n't reveal why . The RAM , hard drive , etc. , were comparable with the other systems ' ' . The Presario we evaluated came with both a DVD-ROM drive and a CD-RW drive . To get our test files on each of the systems , we transported them to the Presario using a DataBook portable hard drive ( www. datazonecorp.com ) , burned them to CD , and then distributed them to the other systems . Again , small features seemed to impress us the most . Many of the systems came with microphones . However , to perform voice training , we had to keep resorting to the headset microphone included with ViaVoice-with the exception of the Presario . Its microphone is built into the top of the monitor and again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , we could n't help but fall in love with this system . * Dell Dimension XPS ( www.dell. com ) . Despite sporting Intel 's fastest and most expensive processor and newer , faster RAM called RDRAM , the Dimension came in second to last in three out of four tests-dead last if you exclude the 450-MHz Mac . The Dimension shipped with a ZIP drive and DVD-ROM drive and an ergonomically curved keyboard . These keyboards are great for touch-typists who are used to them . We 're sure Dell thought they were doing us a favor . However , if you 're not used to this-or worse yet , if you 're a member of the " hunt and peck " crowd-these keyboards can be very frustrating . Even when the Dimension got it kind of right , it was still a bit wrong . For example , we were impressed that the system was shipped with a home phone-line networking card  --  these cards allow you to network computers through your home 's existing phone lines . However , some of these cards include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port for standard Ethernet networking , thereby allowing you to choose ( and change ) your type of network . The Dimension card did n't offer an RJ-45 port . Dell is a reliable brand , to be sure . No doubt , the company provides great technical support for users and the customer service is excellent from placing the order to system delivery , this company knows what it 's doing and it does it well . In fact , the other vendors in this roundup could learn a lot about serving the customer by spending just 5 minutes at the Dell Web site perusing the online support areas . To Dell , selling computers is clearly about more than simple speeds and feeds . * Falcon Northwest Mach V ( www.falcon-nw.com ) . There 's a good chance that you 've never heard of Falcon Northwest . To be perfectly honest , prior to the time we put out the call for the fastest  --  shipping PCs on the planet , we 'd never heard of this company . Falcon Northwest is a much smaller company than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's by design . You see , the company builds its PCs by hand , much like the clone builder down the street in your own town . However , there 's one major difference . Falcon Northwest caters to one specific niche-hardcore computer garners . Look only at the comparison chart and the Mach V might not seem like a very good value . But as we already said , charts do n't always tell the whole story . For example , all the systems came with software for viewing DVD movies on the computer-that is , all except the Mach V. This is the only system we reviewed that included an actual MPEG decoder card , thereby providing superior DVD movie playback compared to any software-only solution . Likewise , the Mach V 's video card included TV and S-Video out jacks . In short , the Mach V was designed from the ground up as the ultimate entertainment PC . If that 's your cup of computing tea , the Mach V does deliver overall value . One small minus : Of all the systems we looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gateway Select ( www.gateway. com ) . At first , we did n't get along very well with the Gateway Select . When we plugged it in , it powered up on its own without anyone pressing the On button . Seemed a little odd , but we did n't worry . Then when we powered it down , the fan stayed on . Some kind of weird sleep feature , we figured . But then the Select refused to power up at all after that . An engineer from Gateway walked us through the fix We had to lay the computer on its side , pull off the side panel , and then momentarily disconnect the power cord from the motherboard . This is no big deal for anyone who 's worked inside a PC , but what about the computer newbie who gets nervous plugging in a USB device while the computer 's still on ? We asked the engineer if this was a common problem , and he reluctantly admitted that it happens " now and then . " Had it not been for this little episode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , competitively priced , middleof-the-road system . But , quite frankly , having to fiddle around with the motherboard left us more than a little skeptical . The Gateway Select performed admirably after we got it running , but if you have to pull yours apart when you first get it home , do n't say we did n't warn you . Other Goodies All but the Macintosh shipped with stereo speakers ( which is one of the reasons we excluded speakers from the price comparison ) . Of these , the best speaker package was the five  --  speaker surround sound system from Klipsch . This package showed up with both the Compaq and Falcon Northwest systems . The three-piece Harman/Kardon speakers that shipped with the Dell also sounded excellent and were indeed the highlight of that system . The Boston Acoustics three-speaker system provided by Gateway was a pretty good midrange system , and the Altec Lansing speakers , designed to attach to the sides of the Acer monitor , were definitely for the budget-minded . The Dell , Gateway , Compaq and Acer computers all shipped with proprietary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these keyboards included special controls-volume , DVD functions , Web browser launcher , etc. - not found on garden-variety keyboards . One note , though : These special keyboards may or may not work properly with all your applications . For example , as an afterthought , we installed Roller Coaster Tycoon ( a simulation game in which you design and manage amusement parks ) on the Acer system . The program ran fine-except when we tried to adjust the volume with the on-keyboard knob . This caused the program to quit . And what can you say about monitors ? Technology has advanced to the point that even cheap ones look great . Aside from an inch here , an inch there , differences between the monitors from these manufacturers were unremarkable-with the exception of Falcon Northwest . The company does n't make its own monitors and so supplied us with a ViewSonic V ViewPanel , a flat-panel display . While it looked impressive on the desktop , this monitor had one annoying " feature . " Each time the computer started up , the horizontal alignment was off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of buttons . If there was a way to keep the thing aligned from one boot to the next , we never figured it out . Special Recognition Award As an extra added bonus , the POPULAR MECHANICS crew awarded a special " Best Use Of USB " award to both the Apple PowerMac G4 and Acer Aspire 6400 computers . On both systems , virtually all external peripherals , such as the keyboard and mouse , are connected to the computer via USB . This is especially cool for new users . You do n't have to worry which device plugs into which port , because any device can jack right in to any open USB port . Plus , the keyboards on both of these systems include an additional USB port . Welcome to the future . The Best As noted earlier , a number of these systems are best of breed in a particular niche . However , the fastest system , the one that was most enjoyable to use , and the one we 'd generally recommend above all others , was the Compaq Presario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G4 . Remember Moore 's Law , though . Come the year 2011 , odds are the Rolling Stones will still be on tour but you 'll be eyeing systems sporting 10-GHz chips , or 10,000-MHz in megahertz-speak . <p>
