<p> Visit Denver Botanic Gardens from Memorial Day to Halloween , and meet African village chiefs , a lion , a black rhinoceros , a baboon and a sacred water spirit . <p> All hail from Zimbabwe . All are hand-carved from stone . <p> Yet , like the plants that surround the sculpture in the outdoor galleries of the gardens , these stones are alive . More than 80 stirring statues make up ' Chapungu : Custom &; Legend ; a Culture in Stone . ' They tell the story of life , death and afterlife in Zimbabwe , a south-central African nation roughly the size of California . <p> In the language of its native Shona people , ' Zimbabwe ' means ' great stone houses . ' Yet the nation 's reality - poverty , political corruption and unchecked disease - speaks to how the greatness of the past collides with the chaos of the present . According to Roy Guthrie , curator of ' Chapungu , ' life expectancy in Zimbabwe is 37 years . Each week , 4,000 to 5,000 AIDS victims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one U.S. dollar . <p> ' It 's known as ' the crying time , " said Guthrie . ' The situation is terrible , worse than ever . The acres and acres of children 's graves are unbearable to look at , marked with nothing but a flattened jam tin . A man who 's been responsible and tried to provide for his family by buying a pension could n't buy a slice of bread for what he 'd get for the sale of his property . And yet , while all of that tragedy goes on in Africa , all this goes on , too . ' <p> ' All this ' refers to the sculptural eruption establishing a reputation for Zimbabwe in the international art community and a sliver of hope for the nation 's Shona people . <p> ' Africa is on the upsurge artistically . The artists are now free of colonial roots , and I believe that in many ways , the next decades of artistic expression belong to Africa , ' Guthrie said . <p> ' Artists are very much valued now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said the curator , who also serves as executive director of Zimbabwe 's Chapungu Sculpture Park . <p> Chapungu , the Shona word for the bateleur eagle , hints at the underlying inspiration for the sculpture . The bird functions as a messenger from ancestral spirits , a symbol of wisdom , strength and the profoundly revered natural world . <p> ' Africans are so close to the earth and all natural things . They really believe in the spirit world , ' Guthrie said . <p> Everyday life <p> In the sculptors ' dreams , dead ancestors speak , revealing images in the stone . Works depict the gravity and levity of village life . Friends comfort a man with HIV . Children play leap frog . Women carry wood , gather gourds , winnow maize , sing lullabies , dance and mourn . A wiry-haired elder lifts an infant to the spirits . A grandmother acts as midwife . <p> Coloradans who attend the exhibit , especially gardeners , will be particularly interested in several pieces with a motif familiar both in Africa and Colorado : drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasted from quarries . Rather , monolithic chunks are pried from hillsides . <p> ' They do not believe the stone is inanimate , ' Guthrie said . ' And they do n't think of themselves as the boss of the stone . They follow the stone . ' <p> Sculptors work with hand tools : hammers and chisels , files and sandpaper.The stone statues appear simultaneously ancient and modern . <p> ' One could easily be forgiven for believing that that work goes back thousands of years , ' Guthrie said . <p> In fact , the Shona stone carving movement began only about 45 years ago . In the 1950s , Zimbabwe ( then the British colony of Rhodesia ) was described as ' artistically barren . ' In 1954 , the predominantly white government launched plans for a national gallery and hired Englishman Frank McEwen as a consultant . McEwen , who had chummed around with the likes of Picasso and Matisse , recognized the vitality of African sculpture . Clandestinely , he opened a basement workshop where artists were not so much trained as turned loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . <p> In 1970 , Guthrie opened The Gallery Shona Sculpture . ' Many people understand the influence of African art on contemporary art , but they do n't recognize the contemporary African artists doing valid work , ' he said . <p> In 1971 , McEwen organized a Shona sculpture show at Musee Rodin in Paris . Le Monde 's art pages ran a banner headline : ' Miracle in Rhodesia . ' Subsequent exhibitions in London and New York wowed critics ; and the sculptural renaissance gathered momentum . <p> As the nation struggled for independence , Guthrie 's gallery struggled , too , eking by - barely . <p> When artists began creating works so colossal they could not fit through the doors , Guthrie closed his gallery and opened the Chapungu Sculpture Park in 1985 . <p> Organic sculpture <p> Denver is among four U.S. cities to exhibit Shona sculpture from the park 's permanent collection . Last summer , the exhibit showed at Chicago Botanic Garden and Garfield Park Conservatory . <p> Ranging from three to 11 feet , from 600 to 6,000 pounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears at home in the outdoor environment . It is , of course , the nature of sculpture that it has three dimensions , but the gardens seem to lend the art a fourth . <p> ' Outside , there 's space . And the stone is organic , made naturally , with no machines . Much of the stone has never been inside , ' Guthrie said . <p> And while the Denver site is smaller than he is accustomed to , Guthrie managed to install pieces in appropriate spots . ' Nzuzu ' by Tapfuma Gutsa floats on the lily pond . Legend holds that this water spirit abducts children and - if the parents do n't protest the kidnapping - imbues them with wisdom and leadership qualities . Morning light , or the flare of the noonday sun , or the sheen of rain , alter the art . Instead of the reverent hush of a gallery , bird song , the honks and quacks of waterfowl , the croaking of frogs and a chorus of cricket sounds surround the sculpture . <p> Moreover , the art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visitors are encouraged to touch . And captions render the art less cryptic . The brief artist 's statements , like the art , are straightforward and poetic . The caption for ' Chapungu ' by Bernard Matemera reads ' King of the Skies - I bless the earth below me . I am a protecting spirit . Your day will be blessed . ' <p> More than a garden <p> The sculpture show is strategically timed , said Linda Green , chief operating officer of Denver Botanic Gardens . <p> ' The Science and Cultural Facilities District is on the ballot for November , ' she said . ' We want to make sure we 're in the forefront with something exciting going on . People do think of the gardens as pretty flowers and do n't understand we 're a member of the American <p> Museum Association . We are a cultural entity ; that 's how we view ourselves . ' <p> Aspects of the culture of <p> the Shona likely will delight and disturb visitors . <p> ' It 's remarkable that we can come from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , to the people of Colorado , with all your modern conveniences , ' Guthrie said . <p> ' This exhibit has bridged cultures whereever it has shown . The expressions are honest . This is not full of cerebral achievements , but people expressing culture . The simplicity and directness moves people .
