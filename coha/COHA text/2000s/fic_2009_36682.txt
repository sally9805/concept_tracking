Memory <p> The first thing I can remember in this life is my father driving his white ox , Endurance , to the sky burial platforms . His back was before me as we walked along a dusty road . All things were dusty in the country of my birth , unless they were ooded . A ditch yawned at each side to beckon me toward play . The fields beyond were drained of water and filled with stubble , though I could not now say which of the harvest seasons it was . <p> Though I would come to change the fate of cities and of gods , then I was merely a small , grubby child in a small , grubby corner of the world . I did not have many words . Even so , I knew that my grandmother was lashed astride the back of Papa 's patient beast . She was so very still and silent that day , except for her bells . <p> Every woman of our village is given a silk at birth , or at least the finest cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to foretell the length of her life , though I 've never known that a money-lender 's sister wrapped in twelve yards of silk lived longer than a decently fed farmwife with a short measure hanging on her sewing frame . The first skill a girl-child learns is to sew a small bell to her silk each day so that when she marries , she will dance with the music of four thousand bells . Every day she sews so that when she dies , her soul will be carried out of this life on the music of twenty-five-thousand bells . The poorest use seed pods or shells , but still these stand as a marker of the moments in our lives . <p> My silk is long lost now , as are my several attempts since to replace it . Be patient : I will explain how this came to be . Before that , I wish to explain how <p> I came to be . If you do not understand this day , earliest in my memory like the first bird that ever grew feathers and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will understand nothing of me and all that has graced and cursed my life in the years since . <p> The ox Endurance bore a burden of sound that day . His wooden bell clopped in time to his steps . The thousands of bells on my grandmother 's silk rang like the first rainfall upon the roof of our hut after the long seasons of the sun . Later in my youth , before I returned to Selistan to see the truth of my beginnings for myself , I would revisit this memory and think that perhaps what I heard was her soul rising up from the scorching stones of this world to embrace the cool shadows of the next . <p> That day , the bells I heard seemed to be tears shed by the tulpas in celebration of her passage . <p> In my memory , the land rocked as we proceeded , in a way that meant I did not walk . I had eyes only for Endurance and my grandmother . My father drove the ox , so my mother must have carried me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feel of arms as a pressure across the backs of my legs , and the sense of being held too close to the warmth of her skin as I wriggled away from her to look ahead . I hold no other recollection of my mother , none at all . <p> Her face is forever hidden from me . I have lost so much in this life by racing ahead without ever pausing to turn back and take stock of courses already run . <p> Still , my unremembered mother did as a parent should do for a child . She walked with a measured tread that followed the slow beat of Endurance 's wooden bell . She held me high enough that I could look into my grandmother 's white-painted eyes . <p> Her I recall well in that moment . Whatever came before in my young life is lost now to my recollection , but my grandmother must have been important to my smallest self . I drank in the sight of her with a loving eagerness that foretold the starveling years to come . <p> The lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . Her skin seemed webbed , as if her glittering eyes were spiders waiting to entrap whatever little kisses and pudgy hands might stray too close . I do not suppose she had any teeth left , for her betel-stained lips were collapsed in a pucker that seems to me in memory to have been as familiar as the taste of water . Her nose was long , not so much in the fashion of most of Selistan 's people , and had retained a certain majestic force even in her age . She had no hair left but for some errant wisps , though as most of her scalp was covered by the arch of her belled silk , I suppose this knowledge is itself a memory of a memory . <p> There must have been a washing , a laying out , a painting of the white and the red . These things I know now from my experience of later years , learned upon the corpses of those I helped prepare for the next life , as well as the corpses of those I have slain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers across his mother 's cooling body to do these things ? <p> Did my mother perform that ultimate rite for him ? <p> Did my mother and grandmother live well together in the presence of my father , or did they fight like harridans ? <p> So much has been taken from me . What has been given in return seems hollow next to the brilliance of that moment  --  the sharpness of the colors painted on my grandmother 's face ; the rich , slow echo of Endurance 's bell and the silvery ringing from my grandmother 's silk ; the faded tassels on the ox 's great curving horns ; the heat that wrapped me like a bright and stifling blanket ; the dusty , rotten smell of that day as my father sang his mother 's death song in a toneless , reedy voice that sounded bereft even to my young ears . <p> That brilliance is reinforced by a skein of later experience , but it also stands alone like the first rock of a reef above the receding tide . I wish that the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the blue-robed men who sit atop the shattered heads of ancient idols in the Dockmarket at Copper Downs . For a few brass taels , they will enter their houses of memory to recount the order and color of festival parades and marching banners in decades long lost to dust . <p> Distant memory is an art that absorbs its followers , immerses them in the mazes of the mind . I am overtaken by recall of more recent times , of blood and passion and sweaty skin and the most pointed kind of politics . For all that was taken from me in the earliest days of my stolen childhood , those distant memories would still be safe and sane compared with what has passed since , if their return were ever granted to me . <p> It would bring me the sound of my mother 's voice , which I have lost . <p> It would bring me the look of my father 's face , which I have lost . <p> It would bring me the name they called me , which I have lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful as sunrise on the ocean . She stands at the beginning of my life . Her funeral marks the emergence of my consciousness of the world around me . <p> For all that bright and shining focus on my grandmother , she was gone at the beginning of all things . Whoever she might have been to me in the rhythms of ordinary living is buried deep within the impenetrable fog of my infancy . I like to think she held me during the days when my mother must have worked the fields alongside my father . I like to believe she crooned to me songs about the world . <p> These things are even less than guesses . <p> My grandmother 's last moments aside , what I hold most in my memory from those first days of my life is Endurance . The ox seemed tall as the sky to me then . He smelled of damp hide and the gentle sweetgrass scent of his dung . He was a hut that followed my father but always cast shade upon me . I would play beneath his shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long , sometimes looking up at the fringe dividing his belly where the fur of each of his sides met and a fold of skin hung downward . The white of his back shaded to gray there , like the line of a storm off the hills , but always spattered with dust and mud . <p> The ox continually rumbled . Voices within prophesied in some low-toned language of grass and gas and digestion that endlessly fascinated me . Endurance would grunt before he pissed , warning me to scramble away from his great hooves and hunt frogs among the flooded fields until he found a dry place to stand once more . His great brown eyes watched me unblinking as I ran in the rice paddies , climbed the swaying palms and ramified bougainvilleas , hunted snakes in the stinking ditches . <p> Endurance had the patience of old stone . He always waited for me to return , sometimes snorting and tossing his head if he thought I 'd moved too far in my play . The clop of his wooden bell would call me back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father had taken him away for some errand amid the fields or along the village road . <p> At night I would sit beside the fire in front of our hut and stitch another bell to my silk under the watchful eye of my father . My mother was already gone by then , though I can not recall the occasion of her death . Endurance 's breath whuffled from the dark of his pen . If I stared into the shadows of the doorway , I could see the fire 's fetch dance in the depths of his brown eyes . They were beacons to call me back at need from the countries of my dreams . <p> There came a certain day in my third summer of life that , like most days there , was hot as only Selistan can be . You northerners do not understand how it is that we can live beneath our greater sun . In the burning lands of the south , the daystar is not just light , but also fire . Its heat falls like rain through air that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always on me , a hand pressing down upon my head to wrack my hair with sweat and darken my skin . <p> I played amid a stand of plantains . Their flowers cascaded in a maroon promise of the sweet , sticky goodness to come . The fat stalks were friends sprung from some green jungle race , come to tell me the secrets of the weather . I had made up my mind to be queen of water , for it was water that ruled over everything in our village . Warm mud was caked upon my feet from my sojourns in the ditches planning the coming of my magical queendom . <p> Endurance 's bell echoed across the paddy . The clatter had an urgency that I heard without at first understanding . I looked up to see the ox 's ears flattened out . His tail twitched as if he were bedeviled by blackflies . My father stood beside his ox with one hand on the loop of rope that served as a bridle . He was talking to someone dressed as I had never seen before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to the furnace of our sun except the dead-pale oval of his face . I wore no clothes at all six days out of seven , and my father little more than a rag about his waist . It had never occurred to me that anyone would have so much to hide . <p> My father called my name . A thousand times I have strained in memory to hear his voice , but it will not come to me . I know it was my name , I know he called it , but the sound and shape of the word are lost to me along with his speaking of it . <p> Can you imagine what it means to lose your name ? Not to set it aside for a profession or temple mystery , but simply to lose it . Many have told me this is not possible , that no one forgets the name she was called at her mother 's breast . Soon enough I will explain to you how this came to be , but for now believe that the loss is as great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa turned toward me and cupped his hands to call out . I know my name hung in the air . I know I ran toward my father with my hair trailing behind me to be tugged by the sun and wind . It was the end of my life I ran toward , and the beginning . <p> Laughing I went , covered in the dust and mud of our land , a child of sun-scorched Selistan . My father continued to hold Endurance 's lead as the ox tossed his head and snorted with anger . <p> Close by , I could see the stranger was a man . I had never seen a stranger before , and so I thought that perhaps all strangers were men . He was taller than Papa . His face was pale as the maggots that squirmed in our midden pile . His hair peeking out from behind his swaddling was the color of rotting straw , his eyes the inside of a lime . <p> The stranger knelt to take my jaw in a strong grip and bend my chin upward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was never a reticent child . He ignored my outburst in favor of tilting my face back and forth . He then grasped me by the shoulder and turned me around to trace my spine with a rough knuckle . <p> When I was released , I spun back hot with indignant pride . The maggot man ignored me , talking to my father in low tones with a muddied voice , as if our words did not quite fit his mouth . There was some small argument ; then the maggot man slid a silk bag into my father 's hand , closing his fingers over the burden . <p> Papa knelt in turn to kiss my forehead . He placed my hand in the maggot man 's grasp , where the silk had so lately slid free . He turned and walked quickly away , leading Endurance . The ox , ever a mild-mannered beast , bucked twice and shook his head , snorting to call me back . <p> " My bells , " I cried as I was tugged away by the maggot man 's strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with everything else to which I had been born . <p> That is the last of what I remember of that time in my life , before all changed : a white ox , a wooden bell , and my father forever turned away from me . <p> Excerpted from Green by Joseph E.
