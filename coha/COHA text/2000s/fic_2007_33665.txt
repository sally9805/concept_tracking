Macy As Macy Baldwin strolled through the stunning marble and mirrored lobby of the Le Galleria Luxury Apartments in Murray Hill , waving at the concierge as she sashayed toward the elevators , her shoes made a soft clicking sound . She pressed the " up " button with a fuchsia-colored fingernail . She tapped her right foot impatiently against the Italian marble floors while waiting for the elevator to arrive . Out of the corner of her eye , Macy noticed the way one of the women standing nearby was staring at her Darius Cordell gown and whispering to her companion . Most women would 've been uncomfortable wearing the strapless black dress and matching tulle wrap at eight o'clock in the morning , but not Macy . It did n't bother her that her clothing announced to the world she 'd spent the night someplace other than her own home . With a subtle lifting of her chin , Macy gave the woman a haughty look . She was a grown woman and did n't have to answer to anyone . Nor did she give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing with it a sigh of gratitude from Macy . She was the first one on and the first one off when the doors opened on the eighth floor . Macy was tired , having spent most of the night in the arms of William Michaels , a popular actor-only to have him run out on her as soon as shehopped into the shower . he 'd come to New York to promote his latest movie on a couple of talk shows . Macy and William had been involved in an on-and-off-again long-distance relationship for the past year or so . She had hopes that he would finally get around to proposing . Instead , this morning he 'd broken up with her- only he did n't have the guts to do it himself . The jerk had sent his agent to do it . Just thinking about William 's rude treatment of her made Macy grow hot with anger . It was n't like she was really in love with him or anything . Her ego was bruised . She would 've preferred being the one to do the dumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he think he was ? It 's not like he was a good actor anyway , Macy fumed in silence . he 'd only gotten the part in the first place as a special favor from her godfather , one of Hollywood 's more successful African American directors . While thinking of ways to ruin William 's budding career , Macy fumbled through her purse to find her keys as she strolled down the hall to her apartment . She smiled at her neighbor , Austin , as she passed him in the hall . " Good morning , girlfriend , " he greeted . " Looks like you had a wonderful time last night . " " I did . This morning was different , though . The great William Michaels turned out to be a jerk . " Macy did n't care that only a few days ago , she 'd been singing William 's praises to Austin in this very same hallway . Austin frowned and huffed , " Men . You ca n't live with Tem and you ca n't live without Tem . " Straightening his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that you and William are over-he sure is gorgeous . " " A gorgeous jerk , " Macy mumbled as she unlocked her front door and stepped into her apartment . The last thing she expected to hear was an angry baritone voice asking , " Where have you been , young lady ? " Startled , Macy jumped and whirled around at the sound of her father 's voice . She laid her purse down on the sofa table and placed a shaky hand to her chest to calm her rapidly beating heart . " You nearly scared the life out of me . What are you doing here ? " Macy regretted giving her parents a key to her apartment . Then , Macy glanced around , fully expecting to find her mother . She was n't disappointed . Rhetta Larson-Baldwin walked out of Macy 's bedroom . " What were you doing in my room ? " Her mother did n't respond . Instead , she moved to stand beside her husband , wearing a judgmental furrow above her brow , her face as pale as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their unity meant bad news for Macy . She was sure of it . " Your mother and I want to talk to you . " Maynard Baldwin 's eyes scanned Macy 's clothing with disdain . " I spent the night with a friend , " she stammered while pulling at the wrap . He was still an intimidating force in her life . Macy stood a few feet away from him , her face pale but proud . " I gathered as much , " he responded in a dry tone . Inside Macy was bristling . He 's got some nerve . I 'm grown . I can do whatever I want to do , she wanted to say . She moved out of her parents " house two years ago and had since been living on her own . " Father- " Macy began . Maynard held up his hand as if to say he did n't want to hear whatever lie she 'd managed to come up with . " Why did n't you pack an overnight bag or something ? , Rhetta inquired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give your neighbors anything to gossip about . You really should be more discreet , dear . " " I do n't worry about my neighbors , Mother , " Macy shot back . " I 'm not like you . I do n't care what other people think . Besides , they 're just jealous . " Her father glared at her , his mouth taking on an unpleasant twist . " When did you intend to tell us that you were n't graduating next week ? " " We 've been telling everyone that you were graduating , Macy , " Rhetta interjected . " What am I going to tell everyone now ? " " You do n't have to tell them anything-it 's not their business what I 'm doing . But if you want to tell your friends something , just tell them I 'm taking a few more classes . " Maynard uttered , " Macy , you ca n't stay in college forever . " " I 'm not trying to , " she countered . " Professor Greenley refused to let me take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my fault . " Macy was unable to meet his gaze . This time it was her mother interrogating her . " Why could n't you take the exam ? " " I was five minutes late for class and he would n't let me in . I 'd overslept because I 'd been up all night studying for the test , " Macy lied . Her mind was working overtime to appease her father . Her father 's expression indicated that he clearly did n't believe her . Wispy bangs fell across her forehead . Frustrated , Macy pushed them out of the way . " I was only five minutes late . It 's the truth . " Like her parents , Macy knew that when she proclaimed something to be the truth , she was definitely lying . " So , what happened with your other classes ? , Maynard questioned . " Why are you failing them ? " It was becoming increasingly clear that her father was n't going to let up on her . " My professors hate me , " Macy whined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy- they are just looking for reasons to fail me . They do n't like the fact that I come from money . They have the mentality that we are trying to be like white people . They say that about anyone who refuses to walk around wearing African clothing , big Afros , and speaking Ebonics , especially Professor Mankuma . I 've told you how he treats me . " " Surely you do n't believe that , Macy . " Rhetta asked . Shaking her head , she added , " I ca n't believe this is the best excuse you could come up with . When are you going to take responsibility for your actions ? " Pointedly ignoring her mother , Macy said , " Father , I 've decided that maybe I should change my major . I really do n't like African American studies . I was thinking that maybe I could switch to fashion design . You know how much I like- " " What good would it do ? , Maynard interjected . " Let 's be honest here . Macy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of shopping . " She gave her father a wounded look , her eyes filling with tears . " I am very disappointed in you , " Maynard began . " Your mother and I have paid good money to put you through the last five years of college , Macy . You 've done nothing but mess around-most people would love to have the advantages you 've been awarded . " " Father . " His mouth dipped into an even deeper frown . " I 'm talking . " Macy was silenced by the tone of Maynard 's voice and his dark , angry expression . She looked to her mother for help , but Rhetta just dropped her gaze . Her mother would not go against her husband . That was usually the case , Macy acknowledged and sighed in resignation . Macy reluctantly returned her gaze to her father . She hated the stern expression he wore on his face . This time she was in hot water with him . She watched him as he took a seat on the leather sofa . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maynard gestured for Macy to take a seat as well . In her own apartment , she 'd allowed herself to be reduced to a child again . Macy sat down on the club chair , waiting . For what , she was n't sure . She just knew she was n't going to like it . Her father seemed to be searching for the right words . After a moment , he took Rhetta 's hand and said , " Your mother and I have made a decision . First of all , I want you to know that this was n't easy for us , but we have to do what we think is best . " Macy did n't like the vibe she was getting from her parents . She knew instinctively that what they were about to say was going to upset her . Her hands trembling , she pulled the folds of her wrap together to cover her cleavage out of respect for her parents . " We 've decided to make some changes , " he said . In a defensive gesture , Macy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread spread over her body . " What type of changes ? " " We 're no longer going to support you , Macy . " It took her a moment to really comprehend what he was telling her . Surely he did n't mean it . He could n't mean he was taking away her funds . Macy could endure almost anything but that . She unconsciously twisted her slender hands together . " Father , just let me drop out of college . I really do n't know what I want to do anyway . Maybe I can just take a year off and then go back . " Stroking his chin , Maynard regarded his daughter carefully . " I 'm in agreement with you leaving college . you 're not doing anything there but wasting time and money . Your mother and I give up . " His next words shocked her to the core . " you 're going to have to get a job , Macy. "                   @ @
