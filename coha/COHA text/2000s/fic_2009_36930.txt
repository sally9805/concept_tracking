We all have a right to our private lives ; it 's living a secret life that gets us in trouble . At least , that 's been my experience . Either the house of cards comes crashing down when the lies and deceit finally catch up with us , or we die with our secrets and someone uncovers them after we 're gone . Either way , we break the heart of a loved one , and that 's our legacy . <p> I own a vineyard at the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia on a five-hundred-acre farm that has been in my family almost as long as this country has existed . Every Montgomery who lived here for the last two centuries is buried in a brick-enclosed cemetery that sits atop a hill near my home and commands a particularly breathtaking view of the mountains . My parents lie in the two newest graves . <p> Every few weeks I make a point of stopping by the place and always find peace and tranquility there . I spend most of the time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to her as the clouds drift across the Blue Ridge in a pretty tableau of chiaroscuro . I do right by Leland , too  --  my father preferred his children to call him by his first name  --  although I do n't stay long with him or talk much . <p> They say God gives us families so we do n't have to fight with strangers . My father somehow managed to be both family and stranger to my brother and sister and me . Each time I stare at his polished granite tombstone with its chiseled epitaph  --  " The acts of this life are the destiny of the next "  --  an Eastern proverb that seemed more warning than prophecy in Leland 's case  --  I wonder about the man he was and the layered life he hid from us . Leland had done a good job of keeping secrets about some of the acts of his life , but in the two years since he passed away , so far nothing he had done had altered my destiny , or that of my siblings . <p> Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cemetery on a sultry late July afternoon was brief . I had picked my mother some fragrant pale pink Renaissance roses from her garden . She planted the bush shortly before she died eight years ago , a few months before my twenty-first birthday , and never saw it bloom . If she had , I know it would have been one of her favorites . <p> When I had finished , I got back in the two-seater Gator and drove to a remote part of the farm where I 'd agreed to let a group of men spend a weekend shooting at one another . That probably sounds sinister , but it 's not . A person ca n't tread on a patch of land around here that has n't somehow been part of the Civil War , a fact that still eats at plenty of folks . Of all the states that fought in the war , none suffered like we did in Virginia . Gettysburg lasted four horrific days . We had four years of misery . <p> So when B. J. Hunt , who owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked if I 'd allow Company G of the 8th Virginia , his reenactment unit , to stage the 1861 Battle of Ball 's Bluff on my land , how could I say no ? Especially when B.J. said the local battle was n't often reenacted , meaning we 'd not only draw spectators and participants from all over the country but the vineyard would also get a healthy shot of national publicity . <p> I am not martial in my interests , nor do I hunt and shoot , unlike my father who was an expert marksman , but I do honor my forebears and our history . The real Ball 's Bluff , now preserved as a national battlefield and a park , is a few miles down the Old Carolina Road at the edge of the Potomac River , and is the site of the third-smallest military cemetery in the United States . <p> B.J. and his reenactors did not want to fight on hallowed ground , but they did want to stage their event as close to the battlefield as possible , preferably someplace near water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken a few small boats across the Potomac from Maryland to Virginia , expecting to find a deserted Confederate camp near the town of Leesburg . What happened instead was a day-long series of skirmishes that ended with the panicked retreat of Federals down the cliffs of Ball 's Bluff into the fast-moving Potomac . The sight of dozens of bloated bodies in blue floating downriver to Washington , as far away as Mount Vernon , so horrified President Lincoln and his Congress that a commission was established to oversee the conduct of the war from then on , forcing Union commanders to answer to a bunch of nonmilitary lawmakers . <p> Goose Creek , one of the Potomac 's tributaries , runs through the middle of my farm . Though it meanders mostly through woods , the creek also skirts a large field beyond the vines that B.J. said would be an ideal place to hold the reenactment , now scheduled to take place in less than two weeks . <p> I was a few dozen yards from the field when the Gator , anemic sounding ever since I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key in the ignition and pumped the gas , hearing nothing but dead-sounding clicks . I was about to climb down for a closer look at the engine  --  though to be honest , I would n't know what I was looking for if it hit me in the face  --  when the ominous sound of wind rushing through the treetops made me look up . The birds suddenly had gone silent . We were in for a storm . A fast-moving one , too . <p> The weather forecast had n't said anything about a tornado , but there was no mistaking the ropy-looking gray funnel that had materialized out of nowhere on the horizon , spewing debris like dirty smoke . The dust cloud swelling at its base was shaped like an old-fashioned oil lamp , and the twister , rising in the middle , had the furious torque and spin of an angry genie . <p> As though its appearance was a cue for what came next , a lead-colored wall of clouds descended from the sky like a curtain slamming down on a stage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see were the undersides of leaves flashing like millions of silvered coins . <p> I fished my cell phone out of my pocket and started to call Quinn Santori , my winemaker , until I remembered that he was twenty miles away at a meeting of the winemakers ' roundtable in Delaplane . Instead I hit the speed-dial number for Chance Miller , our new field manager , and heard him say , " Hello , Lucie , " before the display flashed " call lost ... searching for service " and went blank . The storm must have knocked out reception from the tower . <p> Across the field lightning arced the sky like God was throwing down pitchforks . I tossed the phone , now a lightning-magnet , in the Gator 's open glove compartment and started counting . One- Mississippi . I got only to four when the crack of thunder came , sounding like it had split open the earth . <p> A hard , slanting rain moved in , slapping my shoulder-length hair in my eyes and tearing at my clothes . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout as they are lashed by rain and wind in some perilous edge-of-the-world location , moments before they bolt for safety when the camera is turned off . Seek shelter immediately ! The safest place is the basement of a house ! If you do not have a basement , find an interior room and barricade yourself inside ! Cover yourself with a mattress or hide behind a piece of furniture ! Abandon all cars and mobile homes ! They will not protect you ! Seek shelter immediately ! <p> The warnings never provided for the foolhardy soul who was n't about to be whisked out of the path of destruction by a waiting car . The tornado danced closer , teetering and swaying like a drunkard . If I did n't get out of here soon , I was doomed . I fought against the panic crawling through my mind and tried to focus on my options . How fast did tornados travel ? How much time did I have ? <p> The surrounding woods were no safer than the field . The vineyard , where wooden posts could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a worse idea . Get to a low place , that 's what they always said . <p> On my way here I had driven across a stone bridge my **29;1085;TOOLONG built across Goose Creek shortly after the Civil War . Calling it a bridge was a stretch , since it was really more of a culvert . But it was nearer than the winery or my house , both at least two miles away . Another flash of lightning looked like it struck something in the woods . My skin tingled as I heard the crack of timber splitting . <p> I grabbed my cane from the Gator and began moving toward the bridge . Four years ago an automobile accident left me with a crippled left foot and a devastating pronouncement from my doctor that I would spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair . I changed doctors until I found one who saw things differently . It took surgery and months of therapy and swimming until I finally managed to get around with the help of a walker . Later I graduated to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I can no longer run  --  and I never will  --  other than managing an awkward lope like I 'm half of a shackled team in a three-legged race . <p> The wind shifted and I glanced over my shoulder . The darkening wall of clouds obliterated the sky and it sounded as though a jet or an out-of-control freight train was bearing down on me . I dragged my bad foot like a reluctant child . The dirt road dissolved into a muddy , rutted stream and my right work boot made a sucking sound with each step . <p> How much longer until I reached the bridge ? What would happen if the tornado overtook me before I got there ? Would it pick me up , like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz , and spin me around , depositing me safely somewhere else ? At least Dorothy had been inside a house . What really happened to people who got caught in a tornado 's vortex ? Were they hurled through the air like human javelins ? Or was the drop in barometric pressure so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bridge , blurred and softer looking in the downpour , loomed ahead . I slid down the embankment , grabbing a branch to keep from landing on my rear or tumbling into the creek . Underneath the air smelled of cobwebs and decomposing vegetation . I threw my cane into the darkness , coughing and swallowing what tasted like dirt , as I felt around for a dry spot that was n't some animal 's lair . The rising creek rushed past me in a torrent , but the noise could not drown out the apocalyptic sound of what was happening outside . <p> The bridge was too low and shallow to stand . Instead I knelt as though I were praying and dug my fingernails into the crumbling mortar between the old stones . The rain changed to hail , dancing like hot grease in a frying pan as it crackled on the ground and hissed on the water . Wind buffeted the bridge , sending debris hurtling at me with such force it seemed to penetrate my skin . <p> Only one other time in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my last minutes on earth . For months after my crippling accident , I woke from sweat-drenched dreams where I 'd relived the slow-motion moment I knew the car driven by a now ex-boyfriend would not make the turn and instead slam with a killing force into the stone wall at the entrance to the vineyard . Now the storm slammed into me with that same violence , inhabiting my body and crowding my mind like a demon that would need exorcising . <p> The bridge shuddered as the tornado passed by  --  how close I could n't tell  --  but so much debris and dirt rained down that I was sure it would collapse and bury me alive . Gradually the throbbing diminished and the roaring grew dimmer . My arc-shaped view of the world changed from black to gray . Then the rain stopped as suddenly as someone shutting off a faucet . <p> I found my cane and crawled back outside . My muddy clothes stuck to me like skin and my hair felt like seaweed when I pushed it off my face . To the west the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tornado seemed to have sucked the storm clouds with it , leaving behind blue skies and improbable sunshine . <p> The hail had transformed the summer landscape to a winter scene that dazzled and glittered . In the distance , the yellow-andgreen Gator  --  exactly where I 'd left it  --  was a bright blotch of color against a frozen carpet . <p> The tornado 's wide swath stretched from the edge of B.J. 's battlefield through the woods . I squinted at the low-slung Catoctin Mountains to my south , and the Blue Ridge , which filled the skyline to the west , and made some calculations . The twister had traveled from southwest to northeast . On that trajectory it probably sliced right through the vines in the south vineyard , which meant it might have destroyed more than half of our grapes . I closed my eyes and contemplated the loss of a few million dollars ' worth of vines and thousands of cases of wine . But my life had been spared , and if the tornado missed my home and the winery  --  and God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <p> I retrieved my phone . Still no service . Unless someone came looking for me , I had a two-mile hike back to the vineyard . Before I left , though , I wanted to see up close the gash the tornado had cut through the field . <p> At the edge of the trench a dome-shaped object gleamed in the late afternoon sunlight . I knelt and brushed away dirt to get a better look at it . The first thing I saw were empty eye sockets staring into space . There was a perfect triangular orifice where the nose had been . The mandible with its lower row of teeth was missing , but the maxilla and top teeth were intact . Distant thunder rumbled like a drumroll near the vineyard . <p> It was a hell of a way to announce that the tornado had unearthed a human skull.Copyright 2009 by Ellen Crosby <br> Continues ...
