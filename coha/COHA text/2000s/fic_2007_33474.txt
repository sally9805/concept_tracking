In the shadows of the John F. Kennedy Expressway , surrounded by warehouses , factories and auto-body shops , stands Villa d'Este , a family-run restaurant that serves generous portions of decidedly untrendy Italian-American food at reasonable prices . The restaurant was there more than thirty years before the expressway slashed the neighborhood in two and I imagine it 'll be there long after the Kennedy collapses under the weight of bureaucratic neglect and political corruption . In Chicago , some things never go out of style . I paced the restaurant 's black and white checkerboard marble floor , waiting to ask Johnny Greico if he planned to kill my client . I did n't know how he would take such a question and I decided not to think about it . So I thought about other things . I was doing my pacing in the Library Room , an ornate lounge they only used at night . Since it was just past noon , the room was closed and I was alone with my thoughts . Thinking , Maybe I should have called ahead for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . " How are you , Ray ? " He squeezed my hand harder than he needed to . " Sal , good to see you . " Sal gestured to a pair of faux-nineteenth-century Florentine chairs . He tugged at the top of his trouser legs as he sat , to keep the razor-crease . Throwing caution to the wind , I neglected mycrease and just sat down . " Big John is very busy , " he said . " What can I do for you ? " Big John was Johnny Greico , Sal 's uncle , and nobody outside the family called him that . " I do n't mind waiting . I only need a few minutes of his time . " " What 's it about ? " " Well it 's not about you , Sal . Either I can see him or I ca n't . But I think he 'll be disappointed if you send me away . " We stared at each other for about a week . Finally Sal said , " Everybody gets screened , Dudgeon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy word for a guy like Sal Greico , but I left it alone . No use being a wiseass . " Sorry , no disrespect intended . I 'll just wait . " Sal stared at me for another week , then stood up and left the room . On his way out , he closed the door harder than he needed to . I stood and wandered around , just to save what was left of the crease in my pants . The room had no windows and I wondered if the snow had started . There had been little snow this year , which was fine by me . Gus the barber had bemoaned the possibility of not having a white Christmas , now only a week away . Sitting in his chair , I 'd made sympathetic noises , but I was n't looking forward to Christmas and I certainly did n't care what color it was going to be . I had sent out Christmas cards , not because I was taken by the spirit of the season but simply to remind previous clients that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Greico . Greico was what most people call a Mob Boss . He was probably the fourth-most-powerful organized crime figure in the Chicago Outfit , which made him pretty powerful . It was said that he controlled most of the bookmaking and loan-sharking operations in the Midwest and I had no reason to disbelieve it . The feds had tried for years to make a RICO case against him and had twice gotten indictments , but never a conviction . During the first trial a key witness turned up dead , and during the second , evidence went missing from police custody . Johnny Greico had clout . Johnny Greico was not a man you wanted to screw around with . So about a year earlier , when I got a message that Mr. Greico wished to have the pleasure of my company , I was n't about to say no . Sal had picked me up in a dark blue Lincoln Continental driven by a big boy named Vinnie Cosimo . I recognized Vinnie because he had played some college ball . He was a pretty good defensive lineman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never figured to go pro . Sal and Vinnie had brought me here , where I met Johnny Greico in a wood-paneled office behind the kitchen . Greico was worried about electronic surveillance and hired me to sweep the office and the three cars he used regularly , and to check the telephone lines for wiretaps . He never said why he picked me for the job and I never asked . I suspect that he may have thought someone from inside his organization was involved , but that still did n't explain how he came across my name . As it turned out , there were no bugs to be found . There was a tap on his phone line but it was n't on the premises ; it was located in the JWI terminal . That meant it was a police wiretap and there was nothing he could do about it , except to have his lawyers ensure that a warrant had been properly issued to place the tap . Greico accepted the news without question and let me sell him $8,000 worth of electronic countersurveillance equipment . Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent one day sweeping for bugs and checking the phone lines . On the second day I tracked the location of the wiretap and installed tap detectors on the phones . And on the third day I trained Vinnie in the proper use of tap detectors and bug-sweeping equipment . Vinnie surprised me by being a lot smarter than I expected and it only took a few hours , but I was charging by the day . In the end , I came out with a decent pile of cash for only a few days ' work and I put Johnny Greico on my Christmas card list , not that I ever wanted to work for him again .
