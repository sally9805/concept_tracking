Private Sector By Brian Haig Time Warner Brian Haig " I BELIEVE YOU CALLED ME , " I INFORMED THE VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY seated at the desk . She appeared not to have heard me . " Excuse me , Miss . Major Sean Drummond ... the phone , you called , right ? " She replied , sounding annoyed , " Yes . I was ordered to . " " You 're angry . " " I 'm not . You 're not worth getting mad about . " " I honestly meant to call you . " " I 'm glad you did n't . " " Really ? " " Yes . I was tired of you anyway . " She stared into her computer screen . And indeed , she was mad . It occurred to me that dating the boss 's secretary might not have been a good idea . But she was quite good-looking , as I mentioned , with smoldering dark eyes , bewitching lips , and , I recalled , beneath that desk , a pair of splendid legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leaned across her desk . " Linda , I had a wonderful time . " " Of course you did . I did n't . " " I 'm truly sorry it did n't work out . " " Good . I 'm not . " I searched my mind for an appropriate sentiment and finally said , " So we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past . " " What ? " She finally looked up . " The Great Gatsby ... the final line . " " Fuck off-that 's Jackie Collins , if you 're interested . " She added , icily , " And take your hands off my desk . I just polished it . " Goodness . Now I recalled why I never called her after that first date . Actually , I never called her before the first date-she called me . But I learned long ago that what matters is not who starts it but who ends it . I straightened up and asked , " So , why does the old man want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd rather ask you . " " All right . Ask more nicely . " " Fine . Please , Linda ... why am I here ? " " I 'm not at liberty to tell you . " She smiled . Well , what more was there to say ? She was being petty and unreasonable . I backed away , far enough that she could n't staple my hand to my crotch or something . That smile , however , bothered me . " Absit omen , " I mumbled- May it not be an omen . I suspected it was , however . So I spent a moment thinking about that . It occurred to me that nearly two months had passed since my last session with the boss . These are never pleasant meetings . In fact , they are never intended to be . The boss and I have a relationship that might be described as messy , and he has developed this really weird opinion that if he rides my butt hard enough , and often enough , it will fix itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of time . They have not worked in the past , and we all know that persistent failure is not fertile ground for future success . But he stays at it . This must be what it 's like to be married . " I 'll just wait here till he 's ready , " I informed Linda . It fit , I decided-General Clapper would toast my ears a little , and nosy , vindictive Linda would press her ear to the door and indulge in her vicarious retribution . I 'd tune him out , as I always do , and I 'd assure him at the end , also as I always do , that he 'd made some very constructive points and had seen his last trouble from Sean Drummond . No big deal . Right ? Wrong-ahead lay murder , scandal , and deeds so odious and foul they would turn my life , and this entire city , upside down . In fact , while I cooled my heels in this office , the murderer was already plotting the first of what would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going about their lives , unaware they were in the crosshairs of a monster . But I do n't think Linda foresaw that . I do n't think she even wished it . Incidentally , I do n't work in the Pentagon , where this particular office was , and still is , located . I hang my hat in a small red-brick building inside a military base in Falls Church , Virginia , a tiny place with high fences , lots of guards , no signs , and no confusing room numbers . But if you 're into confusing room numbers , Clapper 's office is designated 2E535-2 connoting the second floor , E signifying the outer and most prestigious ring , and 535 indicating the same side of the building that got clobbered by Osama 's boys . In the old days of the cold war , the courtyard in the middle of the Pentagon was called Ground Zero , the innermost A-Ring was Suicide Alley , and the outermost E-Ring was the place to be . But it 's a new world and things change . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again smiling . I glanced at my watch : 1700 hours , or 5:00 P.M. , the end of the official duty day , a warm early December evening to be precise . I love this season . I mean , between Thanksgiving and Christmas nobody in Washington even pretends they 're working . How good is that ? In fact , the last case in my in-box had just danced over to my out-box , and it was my turn . Anyway , I stepped into Clapper 's office , and he seemed so delighted to see me he even said , " Sean ... I 'm so delighted to see you . " He waved at a pair of plush leather chairs and asked , " Well , my old friend , how are things ? " My old friend ? " I 'm fine , General . Thank you for asking . " " Well , good . You 've been doing great work , and I 'm very proud of you . " His ass relaxed into a stuffed chair , and it struck me I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a health risk . He asked , " That Albioni case , has it been wrapped up yet ? " " Yes . This morning , in fact . We reached a plea agreement . " For some reason , I had the annoying sense he knew this already . By the way , I 'm what the Army calls a Special Actions attorney . If you want to know , I 'm actually a defense counsel in a specialized compartment of lawyers and judges . We 're specialized because we manage the legal issues of the Army 's black operations , a menagerie of people and units so spooky nobody 's supposed to know they even exist . It 's all smoke and mirrors , and we 're part of that circus . In fact , my office supposedly does n't exist , and neither do I , which often makes me wonder why in the hell I get out of bed in the morning . Just kidding . I love my job . Really . However , the sensitivity and seriousness of our work means we work directly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizational chart he bitterly regrets , as we , and particularly me , are a royal pain in his ass . So , what else ? I 'm 38 years old , single , have always been single , and the way things were looking , the past was lining up to be a prologue to the future . I regard myself as a fairly decent attorney , a master of the military legal code , clever , resourceful , and all that . My boss might object to any or all of those points , but what does he know ? In my business , it 's the clients who count , and I rarely get complaints . But , back to my superficially perfect host . He inquired , " So tell me , Sean , what punishment did Albioni take in exchange for his guilty plea ? " " You know ... it was fair and just . " " Good . Now describe for me please your idea of fair and just . " " All right . Two years in Leavenworth , honorable discharge , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look happy . The subject in question was Sergeant First Class Luigi Albioni , who was part of a unit that collects intelligence on foreign targets and who had been dispatched to Europe with an American Express card to shadow the dictator of a country that must remain anonymous . If you 're curious , however , think of a large pisshole slowbaking between Egypt and Tunisia , a place we once bombed after it sent a terrorist to blow up a German disco filled with American GIs , and we still are n't invited to each other 's barbecues . Yet it seems the dictator likes to don disguises on occasion and escape the stuffy Muslim ways of his country to partake in the decadent ways of the West , and Luigi 's job was to skulk around and obtain photos of the camel-jockey as he shot craps in Monaco and cavorted in Amsterdam 's brothels . Exactly why our national leaders would want such disgusting pictures is , you can be sure , a question I would like answered . But in this business , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , it 's all lies . Anyway , a week after Luigi departed from JFK International , he-and a hundred grand drawn on his charge card-disappeared into thin air , whatever the hell that clich ? means . Six months passed before Luigi did something inexplicably stupid : He emailed an ex-wife . To inquire if there was a bounty on his ass , she called the Army 's Criminal Investigation Division , who notified us ; who swiftly arranged to have that same ass collected from a well-known Swiss resort , which accounts for when and how I came into the picture . Actually , Luigi turned out to be a pretty good guy for a scumbag who deserted his country . We bonded a little , and he confided that in order to protect his cover he had tried his hand at blackjack , got seriously carried away , lost ninety grand , then his luck turned and he won nine hundred grand . It was a fingertap from God , Luigi was sure-after seventeen years of loyal and courageous service , the time had come to pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clapper . He logically asked , " And what happened to the money your client stole from the ... from our government ? " I pointed out , " You mean the hundred grand he borrowed ? He always intended to send a check with compounded interest . The rest were winnings-his winnings . " " Drummond ... just do n't . " Well , it had worked with the prosecutor , but that 's another story . " The remainder 's being donated to the Old Soldier 's Home . " " Is that so ? " He raised his eyebrows and suggested , I think skeptically , " A charitable gesture from a guilt-wrought man I take it ? " " In his own words , the least he could do , you know ... considering his crimes , his love for the Army , and- " " And the ten-year reduction played no role ? None whatsoever ? " Well , he obviously knew more about the case than he had let on . And then he asked , " So what did we get for ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give or take change . And be thankful-in the private sector , half that would be sitting in my checking account for services rendered . " " Yes , half would be about right . " He chuckled and commented , " But then you would n't have the grand satisfaction of serving your country . " This was an old joke that never goes down well , and he then added , " Actually , it 's ironic you should mention it . " But he did not elaborate on that cryptic thought . Instead he asked , " Please remind me , Sean , how long have you been assigned to the Special Actions unit ? " " Oh , let 's see ... eight years , come next March . " " I think you mean since last September . Right ? Four years prosecuting and four defending . Right ? " I nodded . Yes , that would be exactly right . But regarding me , I believe wholeheartedly in the eleventh commandment : Thou shalt not fixeth that which is not brokeneth . The Army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken , a mindset that bleeds over into its personnel policies . Actually , nobody in the Army believes there are personnel policies , just a standing order that as soon as a soldier becomes acclimated to a certain place , masters a certain job , or appears happy where they 're at , it 's time to jerk their ass through some new knothole . Professionally , I was very content where I was . Socially , I had serious problems . But Clapper was explaining , " JAG officers have to be well-rounded . Contracts , negotiations , there 's a whole world of law you 've never touched . " " Good point . You 're right . Let 's keep it that way . " " I ... I understand . " He cleared his throat and continued , less tolerantly , " I also understand you 're up for promotion this year . " I nodded to acknowledge this fact before he added , " So , do I need to remind you that promotion boards tend to choose officers with more general knowledge and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Actually , I care . I 'm as ambitious as the next guy , I just want to succeed on my own terms . This , however , was neither the appropriate nor desired response . He got up , turned his back on me , and gazed out the window , across the highway at Arlington National Cemetery . He obviously had something up his sleeve , and I had the sense he was about to transfer it up my ass . That aside , you have to ponder the logic that placed the Pentagon and the cemetery next to each other-the living and dead , past and present , lucky and unlucky-right there . The sight of those endless rows of white stones tends not to promote those aspirations and ambitions that beget hard work , long hours , and diligence . But more sensibly , those markers do remind the powers who rule this building of the price of stupid blunders , which perhaps was what the designer intended . I wondered if Clapper was staring across that road and pondering his mortality . How foolish-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , " Have you ever heard of the WWIP ? " " Sure . I had a friend who caught it once . Very rough . His dick fell off . " He was not amused . " The full title is the Working With Industry Program , Sean . It 's where we put an officer in a civilian company for a year . The officer learns what 's new and state-of-the-art in the private sector , then brings that knowledge back into the military . It 's a highly regarded program for our most promising officers-good for the individual and good for the Army . " " It does sound like a great program . I 'll even name ten guys who 'd love to do that . " I then added , " But my name wo n't be on that list . " " In fact , yours is the only name on that list . " He walked back in my direction and ordered , " Report for duty at Culper , Hutch , and Westin first thing in the morning . It 's located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . " I said nothing . He said , " Do n't give me that look . It 'll do you good . You 've worked a lot of hard cases , and you 'll benefit from the break . Actually , I 'm envious .
