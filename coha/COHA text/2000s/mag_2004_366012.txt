They 're at it again . Renee Zellweger has put the weight back on . Hugh Grant is as amusingly caddish as ever . Colin Firth is again a big , stuffed , curiously lovable goose . And Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason is , if not better than Bridget Jones 's Diary , at least as good . <P> The film is made by the gang that hangs around Working Title , the English production company that has given us Four Weddings and a Funeral , Notting Hill and About a Boy , among other recent delights .

When she is n't putting her foot in her mouth , she 's edging it toward a slippery slope  --  quite literally when she takes a skiing vacation with Darcy , and more figuratively when Grant 's Daniel Cleaver puts his absurdly smooth and hilariously transparent moves on her . Later she finds herself in jail in Thailand , the innocent victim of a drug bust . The logic of this plotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who cares ? Just as we are prepared to forgive Bridget the woman , so we forgive Bridget the movie its obvious flaws because of its equally inescapable charm .  --  By Richard Schickel
