THESE ARE THE EARLY CICADAS , four years ahead of schedule , chirping , shrilling , blistering through their skins . Thirteen years ago the night was electric with their noise , and one burrowed right into me-that little flab of skin beneath the arm socket . Thinking me a tree because lay so still at the thought of what we 'd just done beneath the water oak , Wallace and me . It broke through my skin and climbed deep within , planning to live there for its next seventeen years , sucking and sapping what it can from me . And so there must be something in people akin to the marrow of a tree 's sweet pulp , because my locust is alive and waiting . <p> We went to all the doctors , of course-each grabbing hold of one of my corners , like an old shrunken fitted sheet popping off just when you thought you had it . They were wanting to slice me open to extract the thing . But I was fifteen and big enough to put up a genuine fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was sacred that day : the sky such a blue as kittens ' eyes , the grass beneath us so plush with summer , the oak perfectly leaning for shading us , the creek moving slower than breeze , the absolute shrieking of the cicadas waking in the bark , and , yes , the one locust burrowing into my armpit . <p> I never even noticed it . Wallace held me afterward counting out the ways I was the sun , and for a while his fingers just ran back and forth over the lump , caressing me . Finally he took away his hand-with some fear I might be a mutant , I 'm sure-and there was the slimmest trace of blood across his ring finger . <p> What it felt like it still feels like : no hole at all , a completely enveloped thing three quarters of an inch long and half an inch wide , hard and slightly humming . <p> Any other day I 'm sure I would have been the first to grab a knife . But I just cozied back down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , Mama whisked me off to the emergency room knowing if they would n't do it she would . And the doctors all agreed with her : there was no telling what damage this thing may do , no telling . Could n't you feel it wriggling ? they wanted to know . How 'd it get all the way in when did n't you feel it gnawing at you ? I kicked and bit them and refused everything ; so finally they let me go , insisting all the while that at the first sign of necrosis it must come out . I even saw someone slip Mama a scalpel for moon-time surgery . <p> I do n't think it bit me . I lay on my back , Mama 's girlhood silver mirror-tarnished as some dead granny 's old sugar spoon-angled just so , looking at my bug all that night , and there was not one trace of how it got in me . Mama crying through the wall , Daddy clueless and sleeping one off on his raggedy houseboat . No slit , no hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since just believed I was chosen . I was the happiest thing on earth at the moment my cicada burrowed , and I have always liked to think that 's just what it was looking for . <p> I feel a certain duty to him , and because Wallace did n't pan out , I used to always try to re-create that day . So I reclined beneath the water oak , waiting on Wallace to come back . Used to be a sort of carnival of people watching , of gangly boys lining up . That first year , it was always Wallace , and the only ones who minded a thing were at school-boys wanting to touch it and their girlfriends gawking . After Wallace left for training at Lackland , and I still had three more years of high school , well , I just needed to find myself back by the creek , and who I was with seemed to matter less and less . Thereafter it could be almost anyone . But now it 's been a few years since I 've truly had any chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cicada 's wishing he 'd done better for himself . <p> He hardly ever chirps now , and I ca n't blame him . <p> I live with Mama , and though some may say I 'm too old or too far gone or whatever else it is they 're saying behind us in my little runt of a Kroger , I have n't any need or desire to go elsewhere . And while there is Daddy in the pontoon houseboat with Lerlene Gessum , teased red hairtruly a deep , deep shade of pink , and not one strand of it real-coming out past the width of her shoulders and hitting me in the side of the head when I 'm over for supper on Tuesdays ( Mama 's night at painting class ) , he 's of no help . <p> So everything here was skating along just mediocre when last week , I saw him . Him-you know exactly who-him I mean . Wallace . The same mossy green eyes racing with blue dots and golden flecking . The same cinnamon hair grown into a more businesslike buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , no bangs tangling up in his eyebrows . Same Wallace who spun the moon and held my cicada all night , the three of us burrowing , sighing , moaning , and chirping . <p> If you must know , I did almost faint . Truly . The thing that saved me was that he saw me and came right over , like he 'd come to the grocer 's to find me on a shelf next to the cans of Slim Jims . Though I must say , I 'm cashier #2-always have been-so if he was looking for me I 'm not sure why he stood in Lacey 's aisle first . Anyhow , he came right over , and I was near aswoon but breathed real deep and gripped hold of the cash tray and managed not to tumble to the floor-even if the quarters did a little dance in their bin with me tugging to stay up . <p> He was all the same-seemed high school again , me working after school , him dropping in for sticks of butter , an egg , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iceberg lettuce , one cherry tomato , and a roll . <p> " Pearl , " he said , grinning . " It 's you . " <p> " Oh , Wallace , " I said , trembling . <p> You can laugh , but this is exactly what we said . <p> " You still got that old bug up there ? " he asked , pointing to my underarm . <p> I 've got to hand it to Wallace ; he 's Mr. Smoothy . I ca n't say how many times I wanted to dip his words in Vaseline before opening up my ears . <p> " Mmm-hmm , and you know he 's not just an Old bug . ' " <p> " Well , sure , " he said , tugging at some little bit of eyelash wanting to pull free . <p> Goddamnit , my stomach hit the floor . I 'd forgotten him doing this , him tugging his lashes making sure no loose ones hung about , seeming to be a boy needed loving . Heartless , he was . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Real good . Things are good . " <p> " You still living at your mama 's ? " <p> " Well , course . She needs me , you know . With Daddy floating the Pea with that woman . Of course I 'm still with her . " <p> " Yeah , " he said , bruising his tomato rolling it around on my carousel conveyer belt . " I 'm just back now for a bit . Thought I 'd come see how you turned out . " <p> " How 'd I do ? " <p> Looked me once over . " Just fine , girl . just fine . " <p> I chewed at my lip . " Wallace ? " Could n't help but tilt my head clear to my shoulder , looking down at the pockets of my blue smock . " You ever think of that night , Wallace ? " Damnit to hell , did n't I have one drop of self-restraint ? <p> " Sure , " he said , looking up . Shit-Jesus , those eyes again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You told people ? " I tried to sound hurt , abused . But frankly , I ate it up that he 'd be bragging about kissing on me , about doing things to me , about me at all . <p> " Well sure , " he said , looking up at the exit sign . " It 's not every day your girlfriend 's infested . " <p> Girlfriend . <p> It did n't quite matter what he said after that , because I do n't recall a single word of it . Just that he picked me up off Mama 's porch near dusk and held my elbow crossing the street , one or two fingers trying to slide upwards till I clamped my arm to my side ; nothing 's for free anymore . Still , I could swear I felt my little locust start buzzing about , just to be near him again . <p> There 's hardly a thing fancy in Eunola-just Martha 's Home-Cook , which I suppose is out of the question-so Wallace took me to the Pizza Inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Diet Pepsi in dimpled , amber plastic . <p> " I 've been thinking about you a lot , Pearl . " <p> " You have ? " The words came out like a breath . <p> " Sure . Wonder what you 've been up to . " <p> Did n't know what he was getting at , but pretty certain it was me , so I thought I 'd give him a hard time . A bit . " You could have called and asked . Or written . Lacey gets all sorts of letters from boys she 's . . . " <p> " You do n't want to finish that sentence ? " <p> Blushing would be nice . I 've never blushed . It would be nice . " I think I 'll just leave that where it is . " <p> " You always could rev me up , " he said . <p> " Wallace McCabe , shame on you . " <p> Oh , the way a boy knows how to look at a girl , the way he knows how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her when he 's complaining over the green peppers being on her side of the pizza . How he can glance at her bosoms without being obvious enough that she might be duty-bound to slap him . There 's a great deal a boy knows about subtlety more than I know . If he asked , I 'd pull off my clothes right here in the ripped vinyl booth and climb right on top of him . That 's exactly what I 'd do . <p> " I 've been thinking , Wallace , that maybe he 's just been waiting for such a night to come on out . It 's almost time , you know . And maybe he 's on a different schedule . Maybe he 'll be early . " He was holding me again just like that first time . We 'd gone a little berserk that night , me straddling him-my knees scuffing up on the oak 's shallow roots . Wallace was looking at me and sucking at me , and I about ripped off his dick rocking so fast on him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " <p> " Tell me things , Wallace , " I sort of slurped into his ear in that breathy way a girl talks when she knows she 's got him close to giving her the world , let alone a little bit of air like need or love . <p> He was gripping one of my hips hard , letting his other hand climb up the front of my blouse , letting himself rumple the rayon and tug at the buttons , letting himself pull down one of the cups of my bra . I 've never understood this-why girls allow it ! I mean it just plain ruins the bra , which is no doubt their best bra ; elsewise they got caught in a stretchy sports number on a day they were n't expecting fingers in their undergarb . The trick is : always expect fingers in your undergarb . I did n't stop him . I did n't even care , just thought I might roll my eyes at some point when he was n't watching . <p> " Wallace , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was well aware that my phrasing was dangerous . Any boy 's more than likely going to opt for the I 'd like you to suck me silly interpretation , versus I want you always and forever , you 're my girl , and I want you with me something bad . But I was n't sure how forward I could be with him : we had n't set eyes or tongues on each other for twelve years after all . <p> Sure enough : " This is wonderful , Pearl , " he said , and did n't even open his eyes . <p> " I been thinking , " said Wallace , stuffing one hand deep down in his pocket like he 'd put something there just for me , but then leaving it right where it was . " If I could take a couple pictures , maybe write a little something about it . " He touched a finger to my side , all careful like he thought I might burn him . " That 's what I 'm doing now . Got a few stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my li'l ol ' bug ? " <p> " Mmm-hmm . " <p> " Why would you wan na do a thing like that ? " <p> " Well , it 's amazing , Pearl . Nobody 's ever seen such a thing . It 's like it 's out of the Bible or something . People would think you 're incredible . " <p> " Me ? " <p> " You . " <p> " That why you 're back here ? " <p> " Do n't pout , baby . I wanted to see you . " <p> " Is that why you 're back ? " <p> " Course not . " <p> " Which one ? " <p> " You 've got me all confused , " he said . <p> I put maybe a centimeter between us where we were leaning now against our tree . I pulled my knees to my chest and felt all the things a girl feels after giving it up for what she thought was something but really only amounts to giving it up for free . All that heaviness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirror one of these days . And I 'd felt all that before , of course , but this was Wallace and so I ' bout could have gnawed through my wrists to slit them , for I had no knife . <p> " Pearl , " he said , craning his neck to see up into my face . " Pearly . " <p> " What ? " <p> " What you think about the story , maybe a picture or two-else they just wo n't believe it . " He touched my arm , and I could swear to you that I had another orgasm right then and there , though I know you 'll be calling me a liar , so I wo n't tell you that . ( Even though it 's true . ) What I 'll say is that he touched my arm and then gave it a little squeeze , and I thought : So , he wants pictures . He wants pictures of you , Pearl . He wants to take home pictures of you and your bug because maybe he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there are things you could do to encourage him returning or even taking you with . He could take you with him . That 's not beyond the realm , of course . Just smile all puckery and maybe a little pout and let him touch you almost as much as he wants . <p> He had a camera in the Dodge . Film loaded , flash hooked up . A big jobby with swirly lens and all . <p> " Now lean up right here , Pearl . " He walked me backwards up against the hood of his car . Me in no shirt , just my bra-which he said would n't show much ' cause he was going for close-ups , but I was sort of hoping it would . <p> " You do n't think we need better lighting ? " I asked him , but he just shook his head and went on about fiddling with the various switches and dials on the camera till he was ready . <p> " Now , " he said , " put your left arm up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin there , kind of showing right where to look for the little fucker . " <p> He started snapping shots all over the place , walking around me for every possible angle , my eyes going completely starry for the flashing . <p> " Wallace ? " <p> " Pearl . " <p> " I 'm starting to get cold over here . " <p> " Just a couple more . " <p> " Wallace . " <p> " Pearl . " <p> " I 'm starting to feel cheap . " <p> He took me home a little after that-after three more angles , even one bird's-eye view . Mama was in bed . I crept in . I avoided all mirrors and any sheet of glass . I went to bed , tucking my right hand around my left side , hoping to feel the buzzing , but there was n't an ounce of delight going on in there . <p> Weeks later there I was in clippings Wallace sent back : Bizarre Beast Burrows in Bama Beauty . And then our Eunola Weekly picked up his story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be Doing Fine , with his same picture of my armpit and the swelling beneath my skin-really just a flash of white and then the shadowy outline where my other hand was pointing . You can just imagine the stares I got in checkout lane #2 . You can just imagine . All those girls from school , the ones never wanted their boys to look crosswise at me . All those boys begging . Now here I was becoming a sort of celebrity , and so all those boys who 'd ever laid a hand were back in lane #2 saying : <p> " Strange as all , Pearl . That damn bug is strange as all . " <p> " Did n't feel like no bug I ever squashed . " That was Darryl , whose head was busted in all those years ago in our homecoming game . <p> " You boys just stop , now , " I cooed . I dimpled . <p> " Would n't mind seeing it in the flesh again , Pearl . " <p> " Buddy LaDette , Cherry 's just over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your little can of ham . You do n't think you ought to get back over there with her , do you ? Before she decides you 're on the porch swing tonight ? " <p> Darryl hooted . <p> This is how it was the first week . After that , I started getting mail . All from the same somebody , but I did n't have a clue who that somebody was . Always the thinnest paper-those airmail sheets Daddy sent home to Mama talking about the caves in Marble Mountain at DaNang , back when there was something between them . And always just a few words in my letters : " Slow down , Crazy Thing " or " Too sweet for honeybees . " Clearly a crackpot dipshit like Buddy LaDette . But any day there was n't a letter , I changed my clothes after work and slipped right into bed , just taking a Yodel cake in there with me and waking in the morning to the crinkling of its wrapper stuck to my cheek . You 'd have done the same , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her art teacher , a thin man with a ponytail and only black clothing . Having passed through seventh-grade ceramics under him at Mercy Walker Junior High , we 'd all been sure he was gay-but I can tell you , as one who tried and failed at sleeping next door to whatever it was they 're doing , it was n't anything like gay . Nevertheless , there are some pretty big closets in the world , and maybe Timothy Ray just crammed his whole life into one and is seeing how it plays out . <p> It was a Wednesday night when I checked the mailbox and found it . All day long I 'd been double-pricing and double-billing every third or fourth item and being yelled at here and there by the wives who could n't keep their husbands home-we all know those types , little shriveled-up things who 're so tight they wrinkle round their mouths in starburst puckers . There 'd been nothing in the mail for several days , and I was beginning to feel passed over . Old news . I almost did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side had been broken since Daddy left-that very day when he backed the Mercury into the pole and grabbed hold the flag to hoist it back up on the cinders again . Well , so I did check just because I figured there might be a bill or something , trying as I was not to think of him . <p> And there , in the center of the otherwise empty mailbox , woven through with red ribbon , was the strangest little wooden box I 'd ever seen . It was only about five inches in every direction , and looked like a small prison with its bamboo cell bars and a front door that slid up and back down to keep something in or out . And this ribbon . The prettiest grosgrain you ever saw . Wide as three full inches . A cranberry red . And a strip of rice paper tucked inside said nothing more than SOON . <p> Well , you know I ' bout shit a brick at this . You know I did n't sleep , but just turned this box in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out and she had a whole passel of them tossed off the bed , screwed up beyond unpuzzlement . The next day I was triple-pricing and triple-billing . <p> There was n't much more to say about the week . There was n't much more to say than to impress upon you how rattly I was those days . How everywhere I went I could still smell Wallace on me . Was n't true , of course ; it 'd been many soaks since him . But the smell of boy was with me , was a little like soured milk-just the start of milk souring , nothing frightful or gloppy . Just that little nibble at the nose . Just that little bit of boy . And the wispy-papered letters-no postmarks or any way to know who it was . They frightened me . <p> A little . <p> Like having my legs up over Wallace 's shoulders . Feeling . . . things . And feeling frightened . Because it was happening . He 'd been back but I 'd known he was n't staying . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand up my blouse begging , well , then there 'd be hope . Once you give it , even at the moment of giving it-it 's gone . <p> " Pearl . " Mama came in for lunch , and we sat in the workroom on orange crates with the oranges still in them , the fruit under Mama sinking so low a trickle of juice seeped right on out the corner of her crate . " I think it 's time you find a place . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Do n't you think ? " <p> " No , I most certainly do not ! " <p> " It 's not as though you 're a girl needs anybody 's help . And you got your wages steady . " <p> There was some fleck of leaf on my pants cuff . Oak leaf . I let it be . <p> " Look , Pearl . I 'm not gon na beat around this bush much longer . " She took another bite of her egg-salad sandwich that gummed up her whole mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a number of reasons . I dropped my eyes to her left hand all puffed and swollen tight . " I feel a little hemmed in . " <p> " Go to hell , Mama . " <p> She went on chewing , maybe shifted her eyebrows up at me a touch saying , " Well , all right . " <p> I stopped being able to look at Mama 's face , I mean really study it , when I was nine . Ever since , all I see 's that left hand , the recessing slick white groove of skin at the base of her ring finger . <p> The Saturday Daddy left us , she flipped her ring off the kitchen sink backsplash right down through the drain . I was sitting on the counter picking at the flecks of grit adhering to the base of a cereal bowl from having been stacked too long in the sink-these particular flecks I knew were at least two washings old , ' cause this bowl was cracked at the rim and I recalled my fingernails finding the bits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low-grade fight a few nights running , and the last thing he 'd said before passing out that Friday night under the paper in his favorite sitting chair was , " Damned if that ai n't a mess of dishes in there , Lois . " We all three looked up and in through the kitchen 's pass-through window right at the teetering stacks of morning , noon , and night grazing and her pitiful attempt at providing us meals not come out of cellophane . <p> Come Saturday morning , she was making about as much noise as she could with the water and the clanging , and every few minutes she looked over her shoulder just confirming his absolute no-goodness , his snorting , drip-jawed , easy-smile sleeping . She handed me the last fork , and I set to wiping it dry in the now soppity flour-sack towel she had n't washed long enough , so that Hormel chili and tinned pumpkin pie filling ( meals at least a season apart ) were mingling together there on the fraying hem . She went to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosoms knocking around loose in her plaid housedress and coming to rest just over his face . Still he went on sleeping , went on snorting and growling up the spit collecting at the back of his throat . I thought maybe she 'd start in yelling-I 'd seen it in her before , the very same pressure-cooker buildup and explosion-and I crossed every finger I had against it ' cause he looked tired , and what else did she have to do , and he was my Daddy and somehow being near him did n't make me stand up straight and breathe all rigid the way being near her did . <p> This time , though , she was quiet . She stood up and let her knees creak-crack walking back to the sink-did n't even look one eye at me . She just flicked that bit of gold from the soap gully , sending it spiraling once , twice , hard on the enamel and right down the drain with a good swallow . Then came laundry , mostly Daddy 's short-sleeved line shirts-faded and soft blue cuffs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , before Lerlene spewed her little Chihuahua coughs his way . She went about the house quiet and stealthy as a cow can be in a chute built for calves . <p> It was n't until near lunch Daddy was up and about . I heard them in the kitchen : him opening the cupboard doors neath the sink , hitting the pipes hard and metal so they rang , and throwing his elbows into Mama 's stand of soap bottles and abrasives and polishes which she hoarded in bulk , just like they were snack cakes , for days when she had industrious intentions ( if not industrious actions ) . She stood behind him , blocking his light-could n't help it-her arms crossed over her chest best they could reach . <p> " Did you run water ? " he was asking her . <p> " I do n't know , " she told him , not betraying the least little bit of sorrow . <p> " Least you could do is remember that . " <p> " Well , I do n't , and that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone 's what you need here with me , darlin ' ? " <p> " You wan na ask your chair what tone I ought a take instead of my sweet , calm , genteel- " <p> " My chair , " he repeated , sounding puzzled . <p> " I 've had it , " she said , throwing up her hands and shooting out a leg from what , somewhere in all that cloth and skin , was a hip meaning to sass him . But she stood right where she was . She wanted it back . But even more , she wanted him to do the retrieving . <p> Daddy was on his side now , his torso folding in on itself almost fetally , making him seem small and helpless . He was fitting the wrench to the nut holding the S of pipe to the drain . His elbows were stiff , his twisting of the wrench exaggerated . He saw me in the doorway . " You know how this happened , baby ? " he asked me . " You tell me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , meaning I had n't seen , though this deception was n't at all something I wanted to do for Mama-it just came out ; I 'd been siding with Daddy all these years and always figured to go on doing so . Until what he did next . <p> Wrench in hand ' cause he was n't getting anywhere with that old rusted nut , he poked his head out from the cupboard , ducking to avoid the hanging dishtowel and making a big show of not wanting it touching him . " Worthless , " he said looking at her , and I admit I smiled . " Two peas in a fucking pod , " he said , and looked those fierce blue eyes right at me . <p> I went to the sink then , standing to the right of his bowlegged knee-proppings , and I spun the COLD handle and let the water wash through . We could hear the ring push off the catch of loop to the S pipe , and then all we heard was water . <p> Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I regretted it then , my careless choosing and her pleasure for it . Daddy ducked out of the cupboard and went to the Mercury . And that 's the day he did a number on the mailbox backing up onto it . Did n't once come back . <p> It 's the bruises get you stuck somewhere . The little thumb-sized spot of brown on a shoulder . The swell of raspberry turning to plum on the left inner thigh because his hips are bony and he favors leaning on his right . The little aches of breaking beneath the skin . Those are what get you stuck somewhere . <p> And so you let yourself feel it-the truth of who you are and how little you 're keeping to yourself after so much giving away . Would I change things ? Someone might . But I do n't think I 'm capable of not taking the easy route , the quick route . The one leads straight to my water oak , and straight to hell . I do n't mean fire-and-furnace hell . I mean that gully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of something I did . Some days I can get through without feeling the weight of such a thing as personal ruination by choice , by lack of proper choosing . But then there are the days after : of bruises and of knowing that given a thumb line-up , you could n't match up the imprinted spot on your shoulder-that little spot of tugging that remains on your crest of bone-to its right and proper hand . <p> And so you get stuck . Eating Yodel cakes in bed . Waking in the crumbs . Touching your fingers to the lump on your side to wake it up , but there 's nothing , not one damn shimmy . Sniffing at a dusty bottle of Dry Sack sherry Daddy forgot in the bath cabinet , loving that it smells like soy sauce , and you used to think he 'd maybe come on back for it . You used to think maybe you 'd get him to stick around if you offered to pour it for him . But he does n't even drink that stuff- just some damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you sometimes think about him sipping it with you . You even dream it sometimes , though he 's often a number of people , men-people , in that dream , shape-shifting in and out of focus . <p> I 'm getting sidetracked here . Let 's say it was a rough patch . Let 's just say that and drop it . <p> Now Wallace may be back in Biloxi , making squadron first sergeant and getting all sorts and sundry wing awards , and I might be starting not to feel that divide anymore . I might be . What I 'm feeling instead is that I 'm split down the middle into two girls and neither one likes the other . <p> I 've started seeing a lot of one boy . One I 've never known before ' cause he 's new , a city boy come down from Montgomery to a cousin 's car-parts shop . Someone real quiet and kind of nerve-wracking the way he could n't bring himself even to kiss me our first night . That afternoon , he came in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way with his basket looped to his left hand . Standing his boxes in grid formation , taking away his hand after each one , waiting to see would it fall when the belt started up conveying the circle again . He nodded hello , all shy-like . He 's starting to bald at the front of his head , his bangs thinning through his middle part-just barely , and I pretended not to notice ; it 's nothing . He was in tight blue jeans . His cheeks full of color like a drunk half a bottle shy . His fingernails short , almost painful . <p> " Pearl , " he said , like it was a question he was reading off my embroidered smock , pulling it apart into sound without meaning , just lovely , lovely sound . <p> It 'd been eons since I heard my name come out some new mouth , so I was caught chewing my cud when what I should 've been doing was bagging his rice mixes . <p> " Bet you do n't need a mix . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then my hand was somewhere it should n't have been and he was tugging it up off of him to hold in the air out between us but holding on to it nonetheless . Letting me think there could be something more to me . Letting me breathe . <p> He waited for me to get off work , and we walked , just walked round the town , me trying to give him a tour that did n't amount to naming each boy I 'd been with at each corner or park bench . And when dusk was on us and I 'd had near enough of waiting on him and leaned in real close when he was saying something , who knows what , he told me , " You wo n't believe this , but I 've never done such a thing so soon . " <p> Well , shit-Jesus , knock me clear unconscious ! I slid right into his arms and kissed on him like there was no tomorrow . And then ? Well , slow as molasses on a February sidewalk in Memphis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're asking me or if you 're asking him : three days till the water oak and that night when I found Lacey 's key under the mat and slipped in without waking her shit of a brother who likes to squeeze through whatever doorway I 'm standing in , I started feeling it . <p> That low ache through the middle . That deep wanting to crawl inside a boy . I wo n't give you his name . I wo n't think on him or spend a lick of Yodel cake on fretting this one out . <p> ( Wishful thinking . ) <p> Give me some time to feel this through and I 'll tell you . Give me a chance to ask the bug . I will say he told me I 'm smart . I will say that , because it 's fair . That you should know he thinks about me . It 's fair you should know that . <p> But tell me this . How does a girl know one solid thing , one big old rock formation of not going anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , how can a person be certain she 's the one when the leaves are falling around her and the current 's speeding up ? I 'm not beating around any bush-Mama 's or otherwise-this is an all too unwieldy thing to put to words . This fear of becoming what Daddy would call tedious and Mama would only know to say is dull . <p> He told me he 'd seen the article but did n't read it . The picture , but did n't snip it out of the paper and tack it to his wall . A curiosity , he called it , my bug . And he did n't try much to touch it or look at it , though on the other hand , the few times his arm was about me and slipped down my side and over the hard lump of it , he did n't cringe or wince or pull away in the least . And then he started talking about it . <p> " They 're not like other bugs , " he told me one time we were sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . He 'd poured us lemonade so pulpy I had to keep pretending to sneeze and then wipe my teeth under the cover of my hair falling over my face . <p> " They 're like crickets sort of , but they do n't jump . Just fly or crawl . Real slow , up the trunks of trees , you know ? " <p> " Yeah . I remember . They were everywhere that night . Everywhere . " <p> " They 've got beaks for sucking . " <p> " Beaks ! " <p> " Beaks . " <p> " They do n't always have to mate , you know-sexually . " <p> We sat there a minute , his hand on mine . Me pretending I was n't thinking of jumping up on top of him . Me pretending I was n't thinking to find me a good spot on his neck . <p> " But you 've got it all wrong , Pearl , " he spoke urgently all of a sudden , needing me to know this . <p> I stopped wiping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him . <p> " Your bug-well , it just does n't make sense : I mean , an adult would n't go into you . But it 's impossible that just one egg would be laid . It just ca n't happen like that . " <p> I reached my arm around to my side , pressed at the little thing , felt it give a little reply . I held it . " I know what I know , " I said , sitting back on the step . <p> " I did n't mean anything by it , " he said , putting an arm around me . " There 's all sorts of strange phenomena out there we just do n't understand . All sorts . " <p> I kissed his cheek , sipped some more pulp , sneezed . <p> He squeezed my shoulder once , a sort of wordless bless you . " It 's the boys make all the sound . " <p> " Is n't it always ? " I said , feeling entirely , transparently dumb . <p> He squeezed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kissed me . <p> So if I tell you he buys dirty rice mixes three times a week , always uses checkout lane #2 , and smiles at me and pays cash and says , " It 's lovely to see you this evening , " even though it 's five in the afternoon-if I tell you all that , what can you make of it for me ? <p> And tell me , where is he now ? Is n't that the crux right there ? Says he wants solitude sometimes , says he needs quiet . And I walk through this world shaking for how still it is to me , how little it seems to see me . <p> Sometimes I hold my breath , wait to see if he 'll notice how quiet I can be . <p> Along came Tuesday back around , and from Lacey 's front window , I saw Mama strolling the sidewalk in her big floral number , looking like a squared-off sofa bed on its way to being pulled out . She had her portfolio under her arm , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charcoal sticks and gum erasers . Did n't even look my way . <p> I tried phoning him but it just rang . Off the hook or unplugged ' cause sometimes he says he just ca n't face it . I called the shop but his cousin said he was off all day . I phoned his place again and sat there so long with the cord wrapped around my waist and up my arm that I forgot what I was doing and where I was , and when of a sudden there was his voice , I had n't any breath and could n't have told you my name or his name to save my life . <p> " Hello ? " he said once more . <p> " It 's me , " I said , ' cause I did know that much . <p> " Oh . Pearl , " he said , and that little bit of falling in his voice knocked me clear to the floor . " Like I said last night , sometimes I just need some time to myself . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but thought it would please him to be known , to be fully comprehended . " Just a bit ? " <p> " Just a bit . " <p> My hand needed to hang up the phone . My heart needed other things . " You missing me , darlin ' ? " I said it as sweet as I knew how , sweet and quiet , just like someone not asking one thing in return . Though , of course , that was exactly what I was doing . <p> " Pearl ? " he said , low and near cold . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Some time , OK ? " <p> " I 'm in over my head , I think . " I did n't mean to say it . Shit-Jesus , I did n't mean to say it . <p> " I 'll find you by the honeydew . " A click . Then the hush of nothing on the other end . <p> Sitting there , I gathered my skirt and found it . The bruise was black , if you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and over with being on fire and now turned all the way to ugly and alone . <p> So I went to Daddy and Lerlene 's . Right about now you 're thinking , Girl needs a good sock to the head , a good shaking . Yeah , well . Lacey says I have father issues . She 's wrong . I been wanting to be petted since the day I was born . Got not one thing to do with Daddy or his going from us . <p> OK , so I braced myself for stepping onto the shifting Astroturf deck of the houseboat , braced for having to look at Lerlene Gessum putting her fingers through what may or may not qualify as Daddy 's hair-just long , droopy strands plucking out of the top of his head every inch or so . Braced myself for Daddy asking me what 's doing these days . Never did know what to say to that ; surely he 'd been off the boat and into town enough times to hear some things , and really , I had Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water oak up at the school , I had or did n't have some strange new boy , and I had my bug . And I never really thought he wanted to hear about any of these . <p> He poured us gin in low blue glasses . These were Lerlene 's glasses , and I never trusted a woman so weak of core she thought more of colorful glass than seeing what was in the cup . Still , I drank it , though ordinarily I do n't drink because I 'm not fond of fog . But tonight I guess I was feeling some fog might be nice . <p> " I 'm thinking to float on up to Elba next month , " Daddy said . " Hear Jackson 's got some good work for me there . You wo n't miss me too much , darlin ' , will ya ? " <p> " I 'm gon na take up floral arranging with Diane . His wife . " Lerlene was n't saying this to me , just reciting the plan they must have already cooked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer , and meaning to cut me off . I knew she 'd been pushing for them to pick up and go a long time-not too thrilled still to be the other woman as far as the law and I were concerned . <p> I poured myself some more Gilbey 's . <p> " Pearl , you tell me now what you 're doing with your life . You got yourself any plans , girl ? " <p> I grabbed for the Apple Jack , too . <p> " She 's hitting it kind of hard , is n't she , Juice ? " She did n't even bother to whisper to him . Called him Jice , and I tried always to block it out before I thought about maybe-reasons why . <p> Daddy patted her hand on his thigh , then looked at me with some faith in my coming through with something spectacular to keep him tethered at this dock ' cause he had not one bit of desire to leave Eunola . His forehead scrunched up with how high his eyebrows were . Hopes too . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darlin ' who 's got not one thing in this world to make him proud , and each of us on this floating house knows it . <p> What else could I do ? <p> I stood up . <p> I lifted my skirt to my waist . <p> I pointed . <p> " I have a bruise of a hipbone on my inner thigh . My plan is to see if I ca n't make something work in my life . If I ca n't convince this certain hipbone that I 'd like to talk to him , that I 'd like to sit near him and wake finding him watching me , his fingers unsnagging my hair . If I ca n't close my legs for once in my life and sit still beside a boy thinks I 'm smart and clever and charming , and just be quiet . Just still and quiet and charmingly , motionlessly perfect . I 'm not quite sure what my plan amounts to , how I mean to set about at it , but that 's my plan . " I dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of brandy cupped in my lap . <p> Daddy 's eyes ran up and down me , quick , darty , almost moving in precise relation to where his breath was in him-coming down or going up and out . <p> " Well , that 's fine , Pearl , " said Lerlene , picking up our glasses from the table and whisking them away . I understood : we were done . <p> Daddy and I sat facing each other but watching the grain of the tabletop inch this way and that . Course Daddy is a drinker , so he was probably steady as can be on a houseboat . <p> " You make me sick , " he said , rubbing at the top of his head , smoothing down the hairs . " All there is to it . " <p> I was slugged . But sat there . Could n't think to move because then there was n't ever any hope for him taking it back . He stood up and went down the narrow hallway , beyond the teensy kitchen ( a sink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red drape across their " room . " Must have been crazy , but I thought he was getting me something , wanting to show me something . A little gem of inspiration maybe . A little tenderness he kept hidden from Lerlene . An old photo he 'd squirreled away in his undies drawer of Mama and him dancing or kissing or holding sweet baby me between them , him in vertical-striped pants and a brown suede vest . The kind of picture makes you believe in things , in spite of this world . I thought he was coming back to me . Lerlene was at the sink , rinsing out the blue glasses , setting them in the drainer to dry right next to a lilac bud vase and a red milk glass . <p> I was very , very small then . Almost nothing . <p> " He says I 'm smart , " I called out to neither one of them . And then I left , feeling how deep-in the ache of my bruise was now that it was leaving my skin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Lacey 's place alone . She 's off with so-and-so straight from work . Dreading her brother in a doorway , I take as many loops in my walking as I can . I flip Mama 's mailbox open in passing just to be sure . Nothing . Go over by the high school and see kids get frantic , start stuffing bottles around the base of a rock been spray-painted over every year by seniors on the verge of graduating ( to what God only knows , in this place ) - and I have to wonder then , do I really look so old I might nark ? I suppose I do . <p> I walk to the end of the field by them , need a bit of creek and to sit at my water oak . Feel a kind of heaviness in the air , a kind of heat seems to be the earth feeling clever . Makes it hard to breathe some . These early cicadas shaking the world with such a rattly peeling-free of their skins . <p> I wake without knowing I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Numb without the needles , true numb . Just my lips I can feel , and the tip of my nose . He 's with me . Near me . One hand slipped between my legs , the other inside my top but feeling for my heart . Sitting right here beside me . Him-who ? Does it matter ? His arm 's around me , his face nuzzling into my neck and shoulder , saying my name , saying , Please , Pearl . <p> There 's a loud pop of tire , some hoodlum driving doughnuts in the school lot . I 've my arms and feet back . No one 's here but me . <p> It was Wallace because , I figure , it 'll always-to some degree-be Wallace . No matter the dirty rice mixes . No matter my wanting to tug-down my skirt ; I 'll always tug it back up for him and find myself dodging the mirrors . <p> I 'm tempted to fabricate . Tell you words of his he 's setting just inside my ear . Tell you where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel the rumbling end to hibernation going on in my skin , the waking of life brought on from hearing the other cicadas cluttering up the air , banging away at my ears , the waking of life for fooling us both into thinking Wallace is here . <p> Do you ever think your life 's shaping up with so many clues you 're needing an Easter basket for the hunt-and-gather ? And with so many angles to see something , with so many true signs , you 're just fooling yourself to think there 's no end point coming ? That 's how it is this very moment sitting here at my water oak : pictures of me taken by someone I know never loved me more than a fish in a tank who 'll swim through the plastic tunnel and kiss the vinyl seaweed for a flake of TetraMin , a mama gone plumb wacko , a daddy living on a pontoon barge of a house being sucked on by a maroon-haired nothing-or-other , a tenderhearted stalker somehow knows me and is sending all sorts of things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep to doubt , a boy who seems to both love me and want nothing to do with me , and a bug . If you were to grant me wishes-just pretending there were such things and such possibilities-I would n't know what to ask for ; I think I 've never really known what I want at all . <p> Not even Wallace . <p> So here , under my water oak , coming back to the breathing world-the kids sipping and tittering , pointing at one another after a good joke-I ca n't help but feel so much I 've wasted . It 's hitting me hard , the finity of time . The end always approaching . I 've a good mind to find some water deeper than this here creek , deeper even than the Pea , and sacrifice the suspense . <p> I 'm not prepared to offer any happiness . <p> " Hey , " I call out to them ' cause they 're the only ones around . <p> " Hey , you got yourself a Swiss army on you ? " <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a kid and somehow the tables turn and some old thing 's wanting something from you instead of your hand always out begging . <p> " Yeah . " He 's the shortest of them , and I notice the way he stands with his legs apart , a sort of low castle , and I wonder if it ever leaves his mind-that he 's beneath his friends , always . A crinkly blue windbreaker tied round his waist , his cutoff jeans shorts dragging low off his hips anyhow . <p> " Sharp ? " <p> " Damn straight . " <p> " Well , bring it on over , " I tell him . <p> And he does . This freckle-nosed , mole-armed blond boy . He stands over me , and I can smell what it is they 've got : beer and whiskey both , some pot a couple hours back . The sun 's low behind him , giving the curls at his temples a nice glow . I wrap my left arm up over my shoulder , pull a little at my tank top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing . Utter stillness . Complete remorse . <p> I run my thumbnail along the groove of a few of the blades . Decide on one somewhere in between big and small , with a fine point at the tip . " If you 're fixin ' to watch , best step aside of the light . " He takes two steps right . Silent . Then I do it . <p> I lay the point alongside the lump and then push it in and under . No sawing . Just clean sweeps of the sharpness , careful to err on the side of flesh rather than beast . He holds out a bottle to me I had n't seen before ; must have come from his waistband . " I 'm good , " I tell him . There 's hardly any blood , and that surprises me . Once I 've a half-moon drawn around the head , I set the knife in the grass and feel with my fingertips . It 's all sorts of knitted into me . I run the knife along the flap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let it go . I set the knife down again and check it . <p> Nearly free . I 'm bleeding now . More of it . Down my side . Feels like sweat slipping beneath my breast . <p> " You sure ? " says the boy , not even certain he 's making sound . <p> I grab hold of it ; one more cut and it 's out . It 's in my fingers . This small , very small gray thing not a bug at all . Just a mottled and stringy bit of something . I push at it in my fingertips and smash one end of it with my thumb . This is body . Body gone wrong , but only body . A bit of me , really . That 's all it 's ever been . <p> " You cryin ' ? " he asks . <p> " No . " <p> " Do n't cry . " He 's come forward , is leaning over me . His hand letting itself touch me , my arm . Then my cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away . <p> " Take your fucking knife . " <p> He moves closer , for the knife , I think , but then squats in the grass . Lays his hand on my arm again , and I can feel the boniness of his fingers gripping me-not so much asking to stop this for my sake but for his own ; he 's frightened . <p> " Tommy , " calls one of them . <p> He does n't answer . <p> Then , " Give psycho a kiss . " <p> " Shut the fuck up , " he hollers over a shoulder . " Y'ought to set your hand to that , " he tells me . <p> I look again at my side and see what I 've done . Look again at my palm and see what I 've believed in . I grab my side and feel it hot as hellfire . <p> Do n't know how , but I wind up in a hospital room and there are beige railings on the bed , a beige water pitcher and a beige cup nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ; I know those are her flowered muumuu knees jutting out into the corridor . <p> " Thought you 'd sleep the day away , " says Lerlene , and then shuts her mouth for good . Finally . <p> Daddy comes stand right at my side , looks at me saying , " Damned if you were n't always a little off , girl . " <p> Lerlene hides there behind him wishing she had her blue glasses to rinse , forcing herself to be in the same room ' cause she knows I came first and , even though I 'm one big fuck-up to him , she knows I 'll always have come first . <p> He pats the edge of the bed , by my hip . And to have his hand there-well , mine moves to his without even thinking , without even knowing it . <p> " You let them take care of you now , you hear ? " He 's turning , catches a glance at the ceiling TV . <p> " Daddy , please do n't go- " I start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . I start to , but he saves us both from it . <p> " Just lie back and be good . " And then they 're both gone . <p> Lacey 's next . She squashes her lips in her fingers , pushes them over to the left , the right . " I think you 'd be best off back home again , if your mama will hear of it . " <p> " Sure , " I tell her , " sure . " <p> That 's it , just them . The hallway empties except for Mama 's knees and what I can see of Timothy Ray 's left hand patting her thigh . Someone 's left a pleated page from the Biloxi Daily , another clipping from Wallace : Bug-Girl a Sham . And my little locust cage , red grosgrain strung through , sits empty on the bedside table telling the world he never really knew me at all , not the boy or the bug-its new slip of paper the last lie : FREE . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
