Headnote The playoffs are loaded with players making their first October impressions , but a few of them have that winning " it ' to make it back to baseball 's biggest month again and again MLB PLAYOFFS Jeff Francis , LHP , Rockies The right heart for the job It 's the first inning of the biggest game of Jeff Francis ' life . The first guy up tags a line drive out to deep left field . The second batter singles and the third doubles , scoring the second . Boom , bang , pow . Francis trails , 1-0 . No worries , eh ? " I knew I did n't make a terrible pitch , " Francis says of the run-scoring double . " I knew that those pitches would get me outs most of the time , and it turns out they did . " Smart kid , that Francis . The fourth and fifth batters popped out to end the inning . Francis is cool , calm and collected . Pick an adjective to describe him on the mound . Rockies manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Slow , maybe , but strong , definitely . Before his Game 1 start against the Diamondbacks in the NLCS , he was just trying to find a way to slow down as much as possible , to block out the noise from the Chase Field stands and the intensity in the dugout . It worked . There 's a bit of that Rocky Mountain spring water running through his veins . " He 's matured as a pitcher , " Diamondbacks manager Bob Melvin says . " You can see , confidencewise ... he 's taken it to the next level . " The thing about Francis , 26 , is that he just keeps finding new levels . He was a high school phenom in Canada and a dominating starter at the University of British Columbia-he had 101 strikeouts and a 1.93 ERA in 75 innings in his final season before the Rockies made him the No. 9 overall pick in the 2002 draft . That would have made him the highest-drafted Canadian ever , except that fellow B.C. native Adam Loewen went five picks earlier to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combined 16-3 record at Class AA and AAA before going 3-2 for the Rockies in 2004 . He led the Rockies in victories in 2005 and 2006 , then rose to certified ace status with his franchise-record-tying 17-win season this year . Still , most gave the nod to Phillies lefty Cole Hamels as the better starter going into Game 1 of the Division Series , as they did to the Diamondbacks ' Brandon Webb entering the NLCS opener . Francis clearly was the best starter in both games . Entering the week , he was 2-0 in the postseason , and his ERA sat at a nifty 2.13 . Someday , people will learn to quit looking past him just because Francis does n't have overwhelming stuff or a signature out pitch . His fastball hits the low 90s , and he is an expert at mixing his pitches . His curveball can be outstanding , but he did n't throw it much in the NLCS opener , instead choosing to rely on his fastball and changeup to improve to 5-0 in his career at Chase Field . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a little off his fastball . He throws changeups in off counts , pitches up and down . Steals strikes with his curveball . " Strikes are n't the only things he steak . He has swiped a couple of key postseason wins , too . - R.F. Justin Upton , RF , Diamondbacks A fast guy on the fast track Justin Upton lined a double into center field on the first pitch he saw this season . The pitch was from Alan Johnson , the center fielder was Dexter Fowler , and the setting was John Thurman Field in Modesto , Calif . That , baseball fans , was a long way and a baseball lifetime ago . Upton started his season with the Visalia Oaks , in the Class A California League , and he 's ending it in the major league postseason . Upton , the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 draft , has been destined for these bright spotlights for a long , long time . Hitting .319 combined with 18 homers and 19 stolen bases for Visalia and Class AA Mobile this summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way ahead of where he would be projected to be , " a major league scout says . " But due to Carlos Quentin getting hurt , they pushed him to the big leagues . His average right now may not show it , but I think he 's got a very good shot at being their everyday outfielder in spring training . " With a few exceptions , Upton , 20 , has shown a maturity that most his age do n't possess . " s D-backs manager Bob Melvin first noticed his approach in spring training-last year . " Big league camp , playing in games , getting at-bats and so forth , he was never scared of the situation , " Melvin says . He still is n't intimidated . Melvin stuck Upton into the starting lineup for three of the Diamondbacks ' first four postseason games even though he hit just .221 in 43 regular-season games with the big dub . He understands Upton 's tools , his instincts for the game . " He has exceptional bat speed , " the scout says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a long time . He 's a five-tool player . He 's still just playing on raw ability right now . He 's still got a lot to learn about the nuances of the game , though . " Once that happens , look out - R.F. Victor Martinez , C , Indians Built for the long haul He had three hits . He was intentionally walked twice . He drove in a run and scored two others . He handled six pitchers behind the plate over 11 innings-throughout a 5-hour , 14-minute game-in temperatures that dipped near freezing with the wind-chill factor . There was n't much more Victor Martinez could have done to contribute to the Indians ' crucial Game 2 win at Fenway last Saturday . When it was over ( after 2 a.m . ) , Martinez was asked how he felt . " Great , " he said , smiling , despite bearing the scraggly look of a man who had just completed his first marathon . Wearing catcher 's gear . In a way , Martinez is in the midst of his first marathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the variety of roles he plays for the Indians . Consider : * Martinez is a mentor . He is only 28 with four full seasons under his belt , just entering his baseball prime . But the Indians rely on three fellow Venezuelans . One , ace middle reliever Rafael Betancourt , at 32 , is older than Martinez , but the two came up together through Cleveland 's system and are , Martinez says , " very tight . " The other two are rookies-second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera , 21 , and outfielder Franklin Gutierrez , 24-but were thrust into starting roles late in the season . * Martinez can catch . Defense has been his weak spot . Last year , he was an easy target for basestealers ( he threw out just 14 percent of runners ) . This year , after working with coach Joel Skinner to speed up his delivery to second base , he was sixth-best in the majors at 30 percent . " He 's had to work hard at it , " says manager Eric Wedge . " He takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the hardest workers that I 've seen . " * Martinez is Mr. Clutch . His offensive numbers are impressive-he 's a switch hitter who put up a .301 average , 25 home runs and 114 RBIs . But Martinez 's bat always seems to be most dangerous when the Indians need it most . He hit .356 with runners in scoring position , .400 with runners in scoring position and two outs . In " close and late " situations , Martinez hit .347 . Little surprise , then , that he started his first postseason by hitting .360 in the Indians ' first six games . All of this-leadership , improved defense , switchhitting catcher with a good bat-might sound familiar . That 's because Martinez 's career arc is similar to that of Bostons Jason Varitek but with better offense . " He is a great hitter , " Varitek says . " It 's tough to get him out because he knows the strike zone and he jumps on the first mistake he sees . He bats fourth for them for a reason . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little small , a little slow-a lot good Dustin Pedroia is small . He is listed-with a bit of leeway , vertically and horizontally-at 5-9 , 185 . His uniform fits like a varsity jacket on a poodle . His bat looks so big in comparison to the rest of him that he seems to be trying to get airborne every time he swings . He knows this . His fellow Red Sox , after all , have bestowed little-brother status on Pedroia , picking on him in all manner short of daily noogies . " Just look at him , " says Red Sox third baseman Mike Lowell . " He 's easy to joke around with . He takes it well . " Pedroia , 24 , is a rookie and a prototypical younger brother , undersized but quick with bravado , to the amusement and annoyance of his elders . Lowell knows that well-during a FOX broadcast earlier this year , Pedroia introduced himself as , Dustin " I Own Mike Lowell in Cribbage " Pedroia , a reference to their seasonlong card battle . During August in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a doubleheader off and , after the game , said , " He was on the bench driving us all nuts the whole time . " Pedroia may be small , but his stature helps make him one of the brightest young players in the game . He 's a professional underdog , always hustling , always dirty . Whatever mischief Pedroia raises is easily balanced by his production . He hit .317 this season , with 39 doubles and 86 runs , leading AX . rookies in all three categories . He 's also an excellent fielder who had just six errors . " I do n't listen much to what other people say ? Pedroia says , " I always knew I could play this game , so I am not surprised to be here . I know that it might not look that way to others . " Those others include the many scouts who doubted Pedroia . The Red Sox have had faith in his ability to be a big league infielder since choosing him out of Arizona State in the second round of the 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .308 . But to many scouts , Pedroia was too small and slow , with a hitting style too unorthodox-he swings hard , from his heels , and looks susceptible to off-speed pitchesfor big league success . " When you watch him , he swings so hard it looks like you can use that against him , " says one scout . " But he has great bat control . He is very deceptive that way . He 's definitely someone you want at the top of the order . " Indeed , Pedroia drew 1.12 walks for every strikeout , the fifth-best ratio in the A.L Pedroia 's mastery of the strike zone should only improve with experience . And , if he can fight off the kind of awful start that plagued him this year-he hit .182 in April-he 'll be a consistent .300-plus hitter . " That 's one of the things you have to like about him , " Lowell says . " As good as he is , he 'll just get better . " - S.D . Sidebar Kazuo Matsui and the Rockies are flying high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several young players who have made an impact this postseason . Sidebar ONLINE EXCLUSIVE If the NLCS makes its way back to Arizona , Ryan Fagan will be heading there , too . And if the ALCS returns to Fenway , Sean Deveney will be Boston-bound again . Get Ryan 's and Sean 's big-game analysis at sportingnews.com . Sidebar FIRST TAKES * If you saw Game 2 , you know why Indians general manager Mark Shapiro deserves to be the league 's executive of the year . The Indians had a major problem last year : The bullpen was given to imploding . It had a 16-27 record and a 4.66 ERA and was last in saves . But Shapiro rebuilt the unit , and at no time was that more rewarding than during the 2-run , 7-inning performance Cleveland got from its relievers in Game 2. * What to do about Papi and Manny ? The heart of the Red Sox 's order has been steamrolling pitchers-when they swing . But as dangerous as David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez are with the bat , they also cause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine walks apiece in the postseason 's first five games . Ramirez actually drove in three runs with bases-loaded walks . * Does Rockies manager Clint Hurdle have his finger on the pulse of his team or what ? Sure , it was a risky move to insert Willy Taveras-who had n't played since September 8 because of a sore quadriceps-as his leadoff hitter , replacing Ryan Spilborghs , who hit .328 in Taveras ' absence . But Taveras has been the difference in the series . His single and , stolen base kick-started a 3-run inning , in the opener , his diving catch saved a run late in Game 2 and his basesloaded walk pushed across the winning run to put the Rockies ahead 2-0 in the series . * Conor Jackson might be the Diamondbacks ' future at first base , but Tony Clark gives the team its best chance to win in this postseason. * Eric Byrnes is one heck of a player , but he might be the most frustrated man in America . He mouthed off a bit about how his Diamondbacks outplayed the Rockies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lined into a double play in the first inning , struck out looking in the fourth , popped out with a runner on in the sixth and popped out in the eighth . To add insult to injury , homers by Matt Holliday and YorvitTorrealba sailed over his head . Jackson did n't start Games 2 and 3 after going l-for-4 in Game 1 . SECOND GUESSES * Why is Eric Gagne even on Boston 's postseason roster ? He was brutal after joining the team , putting up a 6.75 ERA in 20 games . The Red Sox seem to believe that one of these days , they will see the old Gagne . But it 's October . This is no time to be experimenting with a struggling reliever . Instead of keeping a long reliever-Boston has two , KyLe Snyder and Julian Tavarez-the Red Sox kept Gagne and Jon Lester , who has just one career relief appearance . Gagne gave up the winning runs in Game 2 , and Lester finished the game by letting in two of his own . * The Indians should address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chalking up Sabathia 's playoff struggles to nerves , but the lack of control he 's shown is uncharacteristic . He walked just 37 batters in 241 innings this year but walked 11 in his first 9 1/3 playoff innings . * It 's the little in-game decisions that have hurt the Diamondbacks . In the third inning of the opener , third baseman Mark Reynolds elected not to pick up Matt Holliday 's little tapper , even though it was clearly foul . The baseball rolled back fair and hit the bag , and Holliday got a cheap single . So instead of starter Brandon Webb getting a first-pitch strike on Holliday-in Webb 's opinion , the most important pitch of any at-bat-Webb faced a two-on , no-out situation . Two more runs scored in the inning , and the Rockies took control of the game . * Sometimes it 's OK to swing at a 3-0 pitch . Like when there are two on and two outs and your pitcher , a career .070 hitter , is on deck . But in the second inning of Game 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get-me-over fastball to the outside half of the plate , then struck out when Jimenez followed with a nasty 74-mph bender and a 99-mph fastball Ojeda could n't touch . - S.D. and R.F. Sabathia seems to have lost his control just when the Indians need it the most . <p>
