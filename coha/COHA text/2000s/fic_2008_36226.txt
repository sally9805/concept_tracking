A Surprising Scenario <p> The after-dinner crowd was exiting the Crystal Phoenix Hotel and Casino 's revolving rooftop restaurant , the Crystal Carousel . <p> Temple and Matt still stood at the head table , watching the last stragglers file up to Temple 's aunt Kit and Aldo Fontana farther down the table , congratulating them on their surprise engagement announcement . The nine bachelor Fontana brothers had been a Vegas institution until Temple 's novelist aunt from Manhattan , sixty and scintillating and devotedly single all her life , had hit town and hit the eldest Fontana brother , Aldo , " in the eye like a big pizza pie , " as the old song went . That 's amore . <p> The dinner had celebrated Temple 's public relations triumph for her employers at the Phoenix : solving the murders at the Red Hat Sisterhood convention and saving the hotel from Bad Press Hell . <p> " We still could have said something about us , " Matt whispered to her . <p> That " something " would have been the surprise announcement that Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional crime-solver , was engaged to be married to Mr. Matt Devine , more widely known as " Mr. Midnight " on a syndicated late-night radio counseling show . <p> This engagement had been more than a year in coming , since Matt , an ex-priest , had first come to Vegas searching for an abusive stepfather . He had subleased a condo in the same building Temple had lived in with her significant other , the missing magician , Max Kinsella , aka the Mystifying Max . <p> A lot had happened in a year . Max had returned after almost a year away , but Temple had already sympathized with the handsome ex-priest trying to settle old family matters and exchange his longtime celibacy for an enduring new love . <p> It had looked like Temple might be the one until Max  --  Temple 's earlier , tempestuous love  --  had turned up again . But Max was a man with a secret mission . A counterterrorism operative since his teens , a man with a price on his head was in no position to maintain a serious relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embers of her old love . <p> Now , Max was mysteriously missing . Again . Now , Matt and Temple had committed the sin of full emotional and physical commitment . She had the engagement ring . All that was left was to arrange the church ceremony , blessing and legalizing their love . <p> Temple the woman could live with that . She would always love Max and wish him well , but a girl had to move on . Matt was a dream of a man , not only attractive , but decent and caring in the extreme . And she 'd secretly wanted him , bad , for a long time . Ever since Max , for good secret agent reasons , had abandoned her so long for her own safety . <p> Temple the crime-solver chafed at the idea that Max could vanish for good and all this time , and she 'd never know why . Or where . Or whether he was alive or dead . <p> Matt squeezed her hand . " A Sacajawea dollar for your thoughts . " He knew where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know her still-raw regrets about Max . <p> She needed to tell Max her decision herself . She needed to say good-bye . <p> " Hey . " A couple was coming up to address her and Matt , not the official lovebirds . <p> Some couple . It was Lieutenant C. R. Molina 's two top homicide detectives , the seasoned Morrie Alch and the petite but per sis tent Merry Su . <p> Su sparkled in her black sequin-trimmed riding jacket and thigh-high-slit slim black skirt . She looked like the Dragon Lady and had been acting that way toward Temple since Molina had asked the PR woman , and not Su , to go undercover as a teenager at a reality TV show shot in Las Vegas , on which Molina 's teen daughter was a contestant . <p> Alch , always the diplomat , drew Matt into conversation and edged away as if glad to escape his partner 's company for a bit . Su was a tenacious detective , but she could be abrasive . Temple understood that . Short , petite women like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an extensive high-heel collection . Su did it with nerve . <p> " I suppose , " Su said , " you miss your pal Lieutenant Molina being here . " <p> " Hardly my pal , " Temple said . She and the tall , no-nonsense lieutenant had wrangled over Max and why he went missing and whether he 'd committed an unsolved murder on the way out of town for more than a year . <p> Still . She would have loved Molina being in the audience when her engagement to Matt was announced . The half-Latina detective might have harbored a hankering for the dishy Polish-American ex-priest . They were the same religion , after all , and Molina had never married and must be pushing forty . Temple was on the cusp of thirty-one , and Matt was thirty-four . <p> Su smiled , always a bad sign . " The lieutenant has n't been in to work the last couple of days . " <p> " Really , " Temple said , unwilling to admit she was interested . <p> " The flu , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iron Maiden of the LVMPD never is out sick , " Su continued . <p> Temple was n't surprised . Molina had never let up in her vendetta against Max . They 'd even duked it out mano-a-mana ( if there was such a thing ) in a Strip club parking lot . Molina had finally caught Max and he needed to get away fast because he knew Temple was in danger of becoming the next Stripper Killer victim . <p> Su 's piquant face had a sly , triumphant look . <p> Payback time for Temple , a rank amateur , copping a prime undercover assignment she had wanted . It did n't matter that it had frosted Molina 's tortillas to ask such a favor of an antagonist . Temple had gotten the job , not Su , who was as capable of looking sixteen as Temple was , if that was an advantage when one was almost thirty-one and aching to be taken seriously in life and love . <p> Su leaned close to whisper , at just the right level of Temple 's left ear . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloped with that hunky magician you used to call yours . That 's why Max Kinsella is missing . She is too ! They 're off together on a quickie marriage license and making whoopee in some cheap motel . " <p> NO ! <p> Temple fought to look unruffied . No . Max would never  --  Molina would never  --  but look at Shakespeare 's The Taming of the Shrew . Men like a challenge , and nobody liked a challenge more than Max . Strong women like stronger men . And Molina was a strong woman . <p> It made a kind of crazy sense . <p> Temple 's pulse was pounding in her . . . temples . She moved away from Su , who slunk into the waning crowd like a snake relieved of its poison . Temple was aghast . Disbelieving . Stunned . Betrayed . Jealous . <p> She looked for Matt , for a glimpse that would restore stability , remind her how much she loved and desired him . <p> He was n't there . Nobody still lingered at the head table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't just Max anymore . It was everybody . <p> She gazed around . <p> The entire room was empty . <p> She was alone at the banquet table with its abandoned dessert plates and crumpled peach linen napkins . <p> This was a nightmare ! <p> She needed somebody to tell her so , and nobody was there for her . <p> Not even the malicious Su anymore . <p> Max and Molina . Max and Carmen . <p> No ! <p> Temple swallowed . She wanted to shout the word , but she could n't . <p> She could n't move . Could n't speak , shout . <p> No . <p> This was a nightmare . <p> Her nightmare . <p> She blinked her eyes open in the dark . <p> A warm hand was on her arm . <p> " Are you all right ? " Matt 's voice came from the dark . " You were making almost strangling noises . Temple ? " <p> Was she all right ? <p> Obviously not , if she was still dreaming about Max . <p> Maybe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max with her worst enemy , the woman of her nightmares , and bid him adieu . Said good riddance to them both . <p> That was it . The dream was a sign any feelings for him were over . All gone . Gone with the Molina . <p> So revolting ! Ugh . <p> She shuddered . <p> " You 're cold , " Matt said , tightening his grasp . " Let me warm you up .
