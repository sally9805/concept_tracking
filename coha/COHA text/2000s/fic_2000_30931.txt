One : Buy Lace  --  Save Malta They had names for the wind , for the different gusts and breezes that blew across the island . There was a wind that brought rain in October , and that was good , relief from the heat and the dust and the merciless sun that beat down through the long , torrid summer . But there were other winds , less welcome . The worst was the xlokk , which began in the Sahara and blew across the sea , picking up moisture and bringing hot , humid weather that sucked the breath from your lungs and brought on lethargy , inertia , frayed nerves . When Rocco was told he was being sent to Malta , he recognized the name , Malta , but had only the fuzziest notion where it was  --  somewhere out there , far off , north or south , in a hazy distance , as dark and mysterious as the name itself , which he repeated over and over , hearing the strangeness , almost tasting it : Malta , Malta , Malta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mediterranean , just below Sicily . It belonged to the British , and  --  the thing he did n't want to hear  --  it was being bombed day and night by the Germans and the Italians . He knew nothing about the winds , the majjistral and the tramuntana , the grigal and the scirocco , blowing through the green clumps of cactus and the sun-scorched carob trees , nor did he know about the rows of houses and tenements made from blocks of limestone that were quarried on the island . The limestone was soft enough to cut with a saw , but in the open air , baked by the sun , it hardened , shading to a rich golden brown . It was early April when they told him to gather his gear for Malta . There was an American team over there , a major and a few lieutenants , who needed are , as on some desperate magic carpet hopelessly out of control . The gunner , asleep in his harness , never knew a thing , but Rocco , unbelted , was hoisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin , unable to move  --  unable to think , even , it was that sudden  --  staring straight ahead through the Plexiglas as the island rose to meet him : streets , roads , church domes , dense clusters of stone buildings , small green fields crossed by stone walls , and smoke , plenty of smoke . Then , as suddenly as it had begun , it was over . The propellers bit air again , and as the plane pulled up out of its long fall , Rocco was thrown to the floor , grabbing for something to hold on to , but there was nothing . They put down at Luqa aerodrome , the largest of the three airfields , and it was a rough landing , the plane bouncing and swerving on the runway . Only a half hour earlier , the field had been raided by a flight of Stukas . On the ground , planes and trucks were burning , coils of black smoke rising thickly from the wreckage . Carrying his duffel bag over his shoulder , Rocco trudged along toward a stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . Before he was halfway there , a siren sounded , and when the crew from the Wellington broke into a run , Rocco ran too , but he stumbled and went down hard . When he pulled himself up , back on his feet , the crew was gone , and he was alone on the tarmac . In the weeds at the edge of the field , a tall figure in slacks and a Florida sportshirt , lanky , with thick dark hair , was urging him on , waving with both arms . Rocco scrambled , and leaving the duffel where it was , ran like hell , the roar of an attacking Messerschmitt loud in his ears . As he neared the edge of the tarmac , aga in he went down , tripped this time by a pothole , and the Florida shirt bent over him and , half-dragging , half-lifting , pulled him into the safety of a slit trench . Rocco was breathing hard . " Close , " he said , feeling a weird mix of fright and exhilaration , a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his first time in a war zone , under attack , and what he felt , besides the fear and the terror , was personal resentment and a flash of anger , because if somebody was trying to kill him , actively and deliberately trying to do him in , what else was it but personal ? The Messerschmitt turned , a quick loop and a roll , and when it came back across the field now , its guns ripped into the parked Wellington , and Rocco watched , amazed , as the plane split open and blew sky-high , the cargo of antiaircraft shells spewing light and color and a riot of noise in the gathering dusk . It was n't just one Messerschmitt up there , but three , coming and going , strafing at will . " I 'm Fingerly , Jack Fingerly , " the Florida shirt said . " You 're Kallitsky , right ? " The voice was American , a smooth baritone raised almost to a shout while the 109s swept back and forth across the field . " No  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bar pinned to the collar of Fingerly 's shirt . " They were supposed to send Kallitsky . What happened ? " " I do n't know a Kallitsky . " " You 're reporting to Major Webb ? " " Right . But if you 're expecting Kallitsky , I guess I 'm the wrong man . " He was thinking  --  hoping  --  they would put him on a plane and fly him right back to Fort Benning . " No , no , " Fingerly said , soft and easy , with the barest hint of a drawl , " if you 're here , you 're the right man . Welcome to I-3 , you'r e replacing Ambrosio . " " What 's I-3 ? " Fingerly arched an eyebrow . " Do n't you know ? " Rocco had no idea . " Intelligence , " Fingerly said . " I-3 is Intelligence . " " I thought Intelligence was G-2 . " " It is , but even Intelligence needs somebody to tell them which end is up . I-3 is the intelligence inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Georgia ? " " They said Major Webb would fill me in . " " Major Webb is dead . " " When did that happen ? " " A bomb got him , yesterday . He was having a pink gin at his favorite bistro , in Floriana . I kept telling him , the gin in St. Julian 's has more zing to it , more sass , but he was n't a man to listen . He 'd be alive today . Anyway , we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , Kallitsky , I hope you 're up to it . " " Raven , " Rocco said , clinging to his name . The 109s were gone now , and he glanced about , scanning the devastation  --  the bomb craters , wrecked planes , the stone huts fractured and smashed , and the burning remnants of the Wellington , its big wings crumpled , in disarray , the ruptured fuselage hot with a bright orange glow , like an enormous bird that had , in its death throes , simply gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line in Nietzsche that he only half-remembered , something about an abyss , about looking into the darkness and horror of a murky abyss . That 's what it was , all around him , a gloomy chaos , and the one thing he was sure of was that he had to get out of there , away from the airfield and out of Malta , off the island , by boat or by plane to Gibraltar , and from there , one way or another , back to the 9th Infantry and the people he knew . " So this is it ? " he said . " This is Malta ? I belong here ? You do n't think this is all ju st a big mistake ? " When he looked at Fingerly , it was n't Fingerly he saw but a cloud of smoke , shaping and reshaping itself in the fading light of the day . His eyes were smoke and his mouth was smoke , his tall , lean body dissolving , vaporous and gray . It was Malta , Malta was doing this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , Fingerly 's face was still full of shadows , but mostly , now , the smoke was just the smoke from his cigarette . " Those Messerschmitt 109s , " he said , " you grow attached to them , you 'll miss them when they take a day off . " He passed a cigarette to Rocco , and Rocco lit up , and he too , for a while , was nothing but smoke , drifting and vague . He was a corporal . When he enlisted , a few days after Pearl Harbor , what he knew about , more than anything else , was secondhand cars . He 'd been working at a used-car lot on New Utrecht Avenue , in Brooklyn , under the el , where the BMT trains rattled by on their way to Manhattan , and he liked it so much he figured that 's what he 'd do for a living : work with cars . Tune the engines , polish the chrome , apply the Simoniz with a big floppy rag , and smell out the customers , sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondhand . He knew a little , too , not much , about Melville , Nietzsche , and Edgar Allan Poe , because he 'd taken some night courses at Brooklyn College , thinking he might go on for a degree , but it was nothing he was sure about , just something he was considering . And now , anyway , there was the war . " Cars , " he said to the recruiting officer . " That 's what I know . " But the 9th Infantry , Second Corps , to which he 'd been assigned , was overloaded with men in the motor pool , so they put him instead into radios and g ave him a crash course in wireless communication , teaching him , among other things , about wavelengths , kilocycles , grid circuits , magnetic storms , cosmic dust , and the aurora borealis . It did n't seem to matter that he had no real aptitude for any of this , as long as he knew which switches to throw and how to deploy his antenna . Cars were good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poe too . But Malta , the idea of Malta , was not appealing . He did n't like it that he 'd been pulled out of his unit and shipped off to strangers , half around the world , and he liked it even less that he was a target for the 109s . They were supposed to send Kallitsky , but they 'd sent him instead , and he wondered how they could do that to him . How could they make a monstrous , life-threatening mistake like that ? " Do n't fret about it , " Fingerly said , casual , with friendly indifference . " The entire planet is a mistake , did n't you know ? You 'll get used to that too . " Fingerly 's car was an old Austin Seven , pale yellow , the fenders dented and the upholstery held together by strips of black tape . The sun was down , slipping away behind the long rows of stone tenements , and in the semidark they drove toward Valletta , first through Paola , then past Marsa and up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were everywhere . In town after town , houses and buildings were down , massive heaps of rubble . Every few hundred yards , there were gangs of men clearing the mess and keeping the roads open . Women too were out there , bending and lifting . " Nothing gets them down , " Fingerly said . " They 've had bombs falling on their heads almost two years now , and just look at them , they 're cleaning up . " " Where are the trees ? " Rocco said . " What trees ? " " The forest . They told me there was a dead volcano covered with trees . " " Who told you that ? " " The pilot , Brangle . On the Wellington . " " It 's the war , " Fingerly said jauntily . " Everybody lies . See how debased life has become ? You ca n't trust anyone anymore . " Not only were there no mountains on Malta , but the highest point was only about eight hundred feet . Here and there a grove of olive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of prickly-pear cactus , and low stone walls surrounding small fields where vegetables grew in a shallow layer of soil . The nearest volcano was Mount Etna , in Sicily , a hundred miles away , not dead but very much alive , giving off wisps of smoke that could , on a clear day , be seen from Malta . " Raven , Raven , " Fingerly said . " What kind of a name is that  --  Lithuanian ? " It was Italian . Rocco 's grandfather had been Ravenelli , from Verona . A tailor . He thought it would be easier in the cutting rooms on Seventh Avenue if he went as Raven instead of Ravenelli . " Was it ? Easier ? " " He was mostly out of work . " " Chica boom , " Fingerly said . " Chica who ? " " A song , Raven , a song . " Rocco remembered , yes , " Chica Chica Boom Chic , " fast and bouncy , a Carmen Miranda bauble . " Life is a tease , " Fingerly said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , Rocco Raven , we are going to get along very well together , you and I. " " You think so ? " Rocco said , sounding not at all convinced . Already there was something about Fingerly that made him uneasy , the velvet manner , something glib in the tone , and he was beginning to wish it had been somebody else who had pulled him into the trench , back there at Luqa , when the Messerschmitt attacked . " We 're a team , " Fingerly said , " that 's all that matters here . You , Maroon , Nigg , and myself . I hope you know how to use that wireless . " Maroon was away , on the neighboring island of Gozo  --  scouting the territory , Fingerly said vaguely . And Nigg was in the Green Room at Dominic 's , gambling and smoking cigars . Rocco thought it would be good luck if , somehow , he could make his escape and find his way home to Brooklyn . His father , with whom he had a muddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to another neighborhood . But still , back there , it was Brooklyn , with trees and backyards , and baseball at Ebbets Field , and all those other good things  --  egg creams , peacocks in the zoo , beer in the bowling alleys , and cars whose motors he could tinker with , making them purr . In a park one night , in lush grass on the side of a hill , he made love to a girl he 'd been dating , Theresa Flum , and he thought she was the one , his forever . But she had a different idea and went off with somebody else , leaving him in a state of despair from which he still was n't fully recovered . " Here , " Fingerly said , taking a lieutenant 's bar out of his pocket , " you better wear this . The Brits are very class-conscious  --  unless you 're an officer you ca n't walk into the better clubs . Remember , though , it 's just make-believe , like the rest of your life . After Malta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Valletta , Fingerly parked outside the city gate , and they walked the rest of the way , through streets lit by a half moon . Here there was so much rubble it would have been near impossible to drive . From Kingsway they crossed over on South and turned down Strait , a long narrow street , less damaged than some of the o thers , cobblestoned , barely ten feet wide , descending all the way down to the fortified area at the tip of the peninsula . Only a slender ribbon of the night sky showed above the three- and four-story stone buildings . In places , the cobbles gave way to slate stairs , and at the far end , down toward Fountain Street , the neighborhood was crowded with bars . " In the days of the Knights , " Fingerly said , " they fought duels on this street . Is n't it a great place for swordplay ? So narrow , and all the stairs . And down the hill there , the bars and the bordellos . The sailors call it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's really a brothel ? " It was . Nigg was billeted there too , on the top floor , in the room next to Rocco 's . Fingerly lived somewhere else , on Merchants Street . " If you 're not happy , " he said , " we can put you in the Capuchin monastery around the corner , but they make lousy coffee . " " Who pays the rent ? " " You do . With pounds and shillings . I 'll cover it tonight , for the balance of the month , but after that it 's your lookout . " " I 'm rich ? " " You 're poor . Your GI salary is being banked for you at Fort Benning , you 'll find it waiting if you live to claim it . Here on Malta we 're free-floating and pay our own way , so you get , from me , a subsistence wage to keep you in business . I-3 keeps an account in the Banca di Roma on Kingsway . If they get bombed , we 'll all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banca di Roma ? " " You know them ? " " I thought Rome was the enemy . " " It is , but the Maltese think it 's smart to keep them around , on the theory the Italians wo n't drop a bomb on one of their own . It 's the safest bank in town . " From his shirt pocket Fingerly took an envelope with banc a di roma printed on it in embossed lettering and passed it over . " There 's your first Malta pay , plus a bonus for getting here alive . The last replacement we had was killed by flak on the way in , he was an awful mess . I 'll get you some ration cards too , you ca n't buy matches or soap on this island without a card . Not to mention bread . " The house belonged to Hannibal Serduq , who lived on the second floor with his wife and family . He also owned the bar across the street , the Oasis . The entrance had three low steps and a door with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foyer , sat the doorman , Nardu Camilleri , Hannibal 's father-in-law , a shrunken old man in a dark suit , bald except for some white fuzz above his ears . On a small table beside him stood a glass bowl for tips , containing coins and crumpled bills from all around the Mediterranean . As they passed the parlor , Rocco saw the women , three of them , waiting for their clients . The room was stuffed with furniture . Against one wall was a pianola , and above the mantel , a painting of the Madonna in a gold frame . One of the women , older than the others , was busy over a newspaper . She wore a red slip with black ruffles , and had a black eye . The other two were on the couch , playing cards . One had streaks of gold in her hair , and a wooden leg strapped to her thigh . The other , the youngest of the three , was plump and lovely , in a blue silk neglige windowed with lace . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fingerly said , nudging Rocco along . As they started up the stairs , there was a clatter from above and two children came rushing down , a boy and a girl , on their way to the shelter , where they slept at night . Th e boy wore a Boy Scout uniform . " Hey , hey , " Fingerly called , blocking their way . " Going to run right through me ? " The boy stared . " Joseph , Joseph , it 's me , Fingerly . Are n't we friends ? " " You give me some chocolate ? Ambrosio gives me chocolate . " " Ambrosio is gone , " Fingerly said . " He 's never coming back . " The boy lowered his head . " I know , he is gone . He was my friend . " " Well , this is Rocco , Rocco Raven . He 's going to be in Ambrosio 's room . His real name is Kallitsky , but we 'll forgive him for that . " " Hello , Kallitsky , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocco said . " You give me chocolate ? " Rocco turned his pockets inside out . He was thinking of Brangle , the pilot on the Wellington , who 'd had no sleep for twenty hours , keeping himself awake by munching on chocolate . " Rocco is your new friend , " Fingerly said . " We do n't like him , " the boy said , turning to the girl . " Do we like him ? " The girl shook her head dubiously . " Well , you 'll get to like him , " Fingerly said . " He 's from Brooklyn and he knows all about cars . He specializes in secondhand Chevrolets . " " I 'm Marie , " the girl said , a few years younger than the boy . Around her neck , on a silver chain , was a medal bearing an image of the Blessed Mother . There were soldiers in Rocco 's outfit who wore the same medal . " Here , " Fingerly said , taking a chocolate bar from his shirt pocket . " I paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to split it . " " You bought this for me ? " the boy said . " I bought it for both of you . " " I 'll take it , " the boy said , reaching . " Not till I break it in half . " But before he could , the boy , in a swift , easy move , grabbed it from his hands and lunged past him , down the stairs and out the fr ont door , into the dark . The girl hurried after , shouting , " It 's mine , Joseph , half is mine , give it back ! " " Sweet kids , " Fingerly said . " They live here ? " " Hannibal 's brood . There was a third , died a year ago . Undulant fever . " One flight up , Fingerly knocked at Hannibal 's flat , and Hannibal came to the door , a burly , square-shouldered man , holding a chunk of bread . There was a long scar across his cheek . " Rocco may be here for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roll he took from his pocket . It was British currency . " This will cover him till the end of the month . " Hannibal looked at the money . " It 's not enough , " he said . " It 's what we agreed on when Ambrosio was here . " " I know , I know , " Hannibal said , rolling his head , " but it 's the war , everything is more expensive . " " How much do you need ? " " Three more , by the month . " " That 's more than what I 'm paying for my two rooms on Merchants Street . " " Yours will go up too . You will see . And I am giving him board as well . " " One , " Fingerly suggested . " Two and a half , " Hannibal said . " One and a half . " Hannibal nodded grudgingly , and Fingerly gave it to him in coins . Rocco looked past Hannibal , into the apartment , and saw the wife , Beatrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain-looking , her hair in a net . She paused , eyeing Rocco , looking him over , then she turned , carrying off a stack of dishes . Hannibal shook Rocco 's hand . " We do n't usually take house guests , " he said . " But the war , it makes everything different . We change the sheets once a week and give you a fresh towel . If you use the women , that 's extra . " His front teeth were ground down to little more than stumps . There was a wart on his upper lip and his jaw was crooked , as if it had been broken more than once . Rocco was impressed by the hands  --  the grip seemed strong enough to bend iron . Rocco 's room was upstairs , on the top floor , in the rear . On a table by the bed was the radio Ambrosio had left behind , and a stack of French picture magazines . Ambrosio had gone AWOL to Majorca , dropping out of the war , slipping away on a fishing boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was not expected back . " He used to pick up everywhere on this , " Fingerly said , as Rocco inspected the radio components . " He pulled in Billie Holiday from the Lincoln Hotel . " Rocco threw switches and turned dials , fiddling with the frequencies . " You can handle it ? How 's your touch on the key ? " " As in dot-dot-dash , good old Morse Code ? I sometimes do n't spell right . " " Well , try to get it straight , " Fingerly said , taking a folded paper from his pocket . Rocco read the message : The monkey is in the box . The Fat Lady has no head . " This is coded , right ? " " Can you do it , or do we need Kallitsky ? " Rocco stared hard at the glowing tubes in the transmitter . " I 'm better than Kallitsky . You know it . Or they would n't have sent me . " He made some adjustments , moving the dials , then rubbed his hands together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact and sent the message . A moment later it was acknowledged . " You did it right ? " " If I did n't , we 'll never know . " " Send it again . " " They got it , " Rocco said , resisting . " It was received . " " Do it again . " " This is why you hauled me out here all the way from Benning ? To send a message about a monkey in a box ? " " Do n't push your luck , Raven . " Rocco hung back , giving F ingerly a long , stony look . Then , relenting , he sent the message a second time . " Good , " Fingerly said . " We 'll eat at Dominic 's , but first let 's go talk to the whores , they get lonely down there . " On their way down they ran into Nigg , just in from Dominic 's and looking petered out . When Fingerly introduced Rocco , Nigg stared long at his face . " You 're not I-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocco said resentfully . " You have the wrong eyes for I-3 . Wrong everything . Are you lucky ? " " I used to be , but now I 'm not so sure . " " If you 're not lucky , " Nigg said , " I do n't want to know you . " He was shorter than Fingerly , with dark eyebrows , a bony forehead , and slack wide lips , an odd loneliness about the mouth and jaw . His shoulders were narrow , and his chest concave . Physically , he seemed fragile , yet there was a hardness in his voice , a darkness , that set Rocco 's teeth on edge . Without taking his eyes from Rocco , Nigg said to Fingerly : " You told him about the Major ? " Fingerly nodded . " Well , " Nigg said to Rocco , " too bad you never met him . He knew a lot about French wines and pagan religions . You know anything about pagan religions ? " " I read some Nietzsche , " Rocco said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nietzsche had a cigar up his ass . " He started up the stairs , and Fingerly called after him . " You heading back to Dominic 's , or are you through for the night ? " " Who knows , " Nigg shrugged . " I 'll be picking up Vivian , then we 'll see . " " We 'll catch up later , " Fingerly said , certain that Nigg would return to Dominic 's , because there was nothing he liked better than to gamble late into the night . And the food at Dominic 's was the best on Malta . He brought Rocco into the parlor and introduced him to the whores .
