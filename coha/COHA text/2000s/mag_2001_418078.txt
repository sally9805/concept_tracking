Six successive generations of my family have lived in call home . But unless farming as we know it today ly that the seventh generation will be forced to they grew up will be lost , and that the farmhous landscape . Neighbors who once talked of improvin their children had a good place to start off are mor , sell when I retire , so the kids can have a little money and wo n't have to go through all I did . " There are points of debate regarding how best to help small farmers , but in this , the I th hour , two things are clear : Farmers must market their crops directly to consumers , and the government must cease subsidizing conglomerates at the expense of small growers . Only under these conditions will farm families be able to remain on their land . Otherwise , it is almost certain that three or four huge corporations will own a series of subsidiary supermarkets , food distribution companies , and millions of acres of farmland . Farming itself will not exist , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil " - has been practiced during the last 2,500 years of Western civilization . Instead , " agriculture " will be run as an assembly line , where specialized workers in distant and often-unseen factories raise genetically cloned species whose DNA has been altered to resist insects , fungi , and viruses . Farm workers will know nothing of food per se , and their tasks will be so specific that they will remain ignorant about the majority of farm work . On any given day , today 's small farmer may drive a tractor , haul fruit to market , repair a ladder , lay cement , call a food broker , and manage the farm finances . The farmer of the future will most likely scan a computer screen or supervise laborers assigned a single task , like spraying chemicals or monitoring a drip hose stretched out to irrigate thousands of uniform acres . Tomorrow 's farm workers will also punch a clock at the start of their shift and work an eight-hour day-something no small farmer in America has the luxury of doing .

Small farmers themselves can once again supply much of America 's fresh fruits and vegetables by taking advantage of potential sales available to them via the Internet , rural stores , regional farmers ' markets , and direct delivery service . By forging ties with the community , farmers can let their gardens , orchards , and dairies once again become community institutions , places where people go to buy everything from holiday gourds and Christmas trees to weekly supplies of apples , canned peaches , hams , eggs , and milk . And as families become accustomed to fresh , seasonal produce , farmers will seek out tastier varieties-not genetically modified crops that are designed to look attractive and ship well . As a result , the DNA of food will stay pretty much as it has for the last 7,000 years of civilized agriculture . The choice of which world we will inhabit in the next century is largely our own . Luckily , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that suburban families and consumers can do to ensure the small farm 's existence as a way of life . For starters , we can make a commitment to buy local and regional produce in season and then patronize grocery stores and farmers ' markets that do the same . We also need to become concerned voters and support agricultural policies that favor family farmers . As things stand now , very little of the billions spent on agriculture goes to family farmers ; most is allotted to corporations , universities , research centers , and commodities exchanges . As voters , we should demand that politicians specify exactly how our $35 billion of taxpayer money is allotted , for whom subsidies are targeted , and for what purpose they are spent . Photograph Photograph // It is also high time for antitrust legislation to extend to agriculture . just as doctors can not own the drugstores that fulfill their prescriptions , so , too , food processors and brokers should not own land . If the agribusinesses that now control food from the field to the store were broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shippers , who would then have no recourse other than to buy directly from the men and women who grow the foods they sell . Likewise , food brokers , who could no longer own their own megafarms , would be required to visit farms , court families to buy their harvests , and compete to find reliable , trusted producers . Another step in the right direction would be a radical overhaul of federal and state taxation . Family farmers should be exempt from inheritance taxes ; there should be enhanced propertytax incentives for keeping land pristine and protected from urban sprawl-especially since the easiest way for struggling farmers to raise capital now is to sell a parcel of their land to developers . " No one cared when I was going broke farming , " one retiring farmer told me , " so why should I care now if I sell my vineyard to a guy who 's going to build a shopping center ? " There must be responsibility-and honesty-on the part of consumers as well . We can not rail about pesticides and bland-tasting fruit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , and oranges in August . If you truly want to help farmers , buy foods in season , and look for regional produce . Likewise , the farmer who cultivates 100 acres of string beans , corn , and lettuce on the fringe of town can no longer be totally independent . My own family used to chuckle about " them " - the " city " people who , we felt , knew little and cared less about farming . But no longer . Over the last decade we learned that " they " are , in fact , the hundreds of loyal customers who have helped us stay afloat . Let 's hope that America 's 21 st-century agrarians will emerge as entrepreneurs and teachers combined , men and women who through perseverance and hard work can help to preserve our nation 's countryside . These new agrarians may not resemble the elderly farmers perched on the front porch in TV advertisements , but if they can save family agriculture , they will in some ways be tougher , more enterprising , and more valuable than any generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidebar CAN THE FAMILY FARM SURVIVE ? Sidebar With the support of the American people , the answer is yes . Support zoning laws that mandate greenbelts and undeveloped space around suburbs-both serve as transitional areas , helping to integrate town and country . Go straight to the source for things like your Thanksgiving pumpkins and holiday spruce and firs . Find out who operates a U-pick berry farm in summer , and who lets families gather apples from their back 40 in autumn . These side businesses often represent the only way a family farmer has managed to stay in business .
