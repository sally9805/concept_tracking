. Joseph Longo has invented a machine that turns our most vile trash into clean energy  --  and promises to make a relic of the landfill . IT SOUNDS AS IF someone just dropped a tricycle into a meat grinder . I 'm sitting inside a narrow conference room at a research facility in Bristol , Connecticut , chatting with Joseph Longo , the founder and CEO of Startech Environmental Corporation . As we munch on takeout Subway sandwiches , a plate-glass window is the only thing separating us from the adjacent lab , which contains a glowing caldera of " plasma " three times as hot as the surface of the sun . Every few minutes there 's a horrific clanking noise  --  grinding followed by a thunderous voomp , like the sound a gas barbecue makes when it first ignites . " Is it supposed to do that ? " I ask Longo nervously . " Yup , " he says . " That 's normal . " Despite his 74 years , Longo bears an unnerving resemblance to the longtime cover boy of Mad magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the glib catchphrase " What , me worry ? " Both share red hair , a smattering of freckles and a toothy grin . When such a man tells me I 'm perfectly safe from a 30,000F arc of man-made lightning heating a vat of plasma that his employees are " controlling " in the next room  --  well , I 'm not completely reassured . To put me at ease , Longo calls in David Lynch , who manages the demonstration facility . " There 's no flame or fire inside . It 's just electricity , " Lynch assures me of the multimillion-dollar system that took Longo almost two decades to design and build . Then the two usher me into the lab , where the gleaming 15-foot-tall machine they 've named the Plasma Converter stands in the center of the room . The entire thing takes up about as much space as a two-car garage , surprisingly compact for a machine that can consume nearly any type of waste  --  from dirty diapers to chemical weapons  --  by annihilating toxic materials in a process as old as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little like the big bang , only backward ( you get nothing from something ) . Inside a sealed vessel made of stainless steel and filled with a stable gas  --  either pure nitrogen or , as in this case , ordinary air  --  a 650-volt current passing between two electrodes rips electrons from the air , converting the gas into plasma . Current flows continuously through this newly formed plasma , creating a field of extremely intense energy very much like lightning . The radiant energy of the plasma arc is so powerful , it disintegrates trash into its constituent elements by tearing apart molecular bonds . The system is capable of breaking down pretty much anything except nuclear waste , the isotopes of which are indestructible . The only by-products are an obsidian-like glass used as a raw material for numerous applications , including bathroom tiles and high-strength asphalt , and a synthesis gas , or " syngas "  --  a mixture of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide that can be converted into a variety of marketable fuels , including ethanol , natural gas and hydrogen . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's self-sustaining . Just like your toaster , Startech 's Plasma Converter draws its power from the electrical grid to get started . The initial voltage is about equal to the zap from a police stun gun . But once the cycle is under way , the 2,200F syngas is fed into a cooling system , generating steam that drives turbines to produce electricity . About two thirds of the power is siphoned off to run the converter ; the rest can be used on-site for heating or electricity , or sold back to the utility grid . " Even a blackout would not stop the operation of the facility , " Longo says . It all sounds far too good to be true . But the technology works . Over the past decade , half a dozen companies have been developing plasma technology to turn garbage into energy . " The best renewable energy is the one we complain about the most : municipal solid waste , " says Louis Circeo , the director of plasma research at the Georgia Institute of Technology . " It will prove cheaper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump it on a landfill . " A Startech machine that costs roughly $250 million could handle 2,000 tons of waste daily , approximately what a city of a million people amasses in that time span . Large municipalities typically haul their trash to landfills , where the operator charges a " tipping fee " to dump the waste . The national average is $35 a ton , although the cost can be more than twice that in the Northeast ( where land is scarce , tipping fees are higher ) . And the tipping fee a city pays does n't include the price of trucking the garbage often hundreds of miles to a landfill or the cost of capturing leaky methane  --  a greenhouse gas  --  from the decomposing waste . In a city with an average tipping fee , a $250-million converter could pay for itself in about 10 years , and that 's without factoring in the money made from selling the excess electricity and syngas . After that break-even point , it 's pure profit . Someday very soon , cities might actually make money from garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled up to Startech R &D; to see Longo waiting for me in the parking lot . Wearing a bright yellow oxford shirt , a striped tie and blue pinstriped pants , he dashed across the blacktop to greet me as I stepped from my rental car . A street-smart Brooklyn native , Longo was an only child raised by parents who worked long hours at a local factory that made baseballs and footballs . He volunteered to fight in Korea as a paratrooper after a friend was killed in action . He 's fond of antiquated slang like " attaboy " and " shills " ( as in " those shills stole my patents " ) and is old-school enough to have only recently abandoned the protractors , pencils and drafting tables that he used to design his original Plasma Converter in favor of computers . Today , Longo is meeting with investors from U.S. Energy , a trio of veteran waste-disposal executives who recently formed a partnership to build the first plasma-gasification plant on Long Island , New York . They own a transfer station ( where garbage goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of buying six Startech converters to handle 3,000 tons of construction debris a day trucked from sites around the state . " It 's mostly old tile , wood , nails , glass , metal and wire all mixed together , " one of the project 's partners , Troy Caruso , tells me . For the demonstration , Longo prepares a sampling of typical garbage  --  bottles of leftover prescription drugs , bits of fiberglass insulation , a half-empty can of Slim-Fast . A conveyer belt feeds the trash into an auger , which shreds and crushes it into pea-size morsels ( that explains the deafening grinding sound ) before stuffing it into the plasma-reactor chamber . The room is warm and humid , and a dull hum emanates from the machinery . Caruso and his partners , Paul Marazzo and Michael Nuzzi , are silent at first . They 've seen the demo before . But as more trash vanishes into the converter , they become increasingly animated , spouting off facts and figures about how the machine will revolutionize their business . " This technology eliminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nuzzi says . " And we can use it to generate fuel at the back end , " adds Marazzo , who then asks Lynch if the converter can handle chunks of concrete ( answer : yes ) . " The bottom line is that nobody wants a landfill in their backyard , " Nuzzi tells me . New York City is already paying an astronomical $90 a ton to get rid of its trash . According to Startech , a few 2,000-ton-per-day plasma-gasification plants could do it for $36 . Sell the syngas and surplus electricity , and you 'd actually net $15 a ton . " Gasification is not just environmentally friendly , " Nuzzi says . " It 's a good business decision . " The converter we 're watching vaporize Slim-Fast is a mini version of Startech 's technology , capable of consuming five tons a day of solid waste , or about what 2,200 Americans toss in the trash every 24 hours . Fueled with garbage from the local dump , the converter is fired up whenever Longo pitches visiting clients . Longo has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system at McMurdo Station in Antarctica . The Vietnamese government is considering buying one to get rid of stockpiles of Agent Orange that the U.S. military left behind after the war . Investors from China , Poland , Japan , Romania , Italy , Russia , Brazil , Venezuela , the U.K. , Mexico and Canada have all entered contract negotiations with Startech after making the pilgrimage to Bristol to see Longo 's dog-and-pony show . Startech is n't the only company using plasma to turn waste into a source of clean energy . A handful of startups  --  Geoplasma , Recovered Energy , PyroGenesis , EnviroArc and Plasco Energy , among others  --  have entered the market in the past decade . But Longo , who has worked in the garbage business for four decades , is perhaps the industry 's most passionate founding father . " What 's so devilishly wonderful about plasma gasification is that it 's completely circular , " he says . " It takes everything back to its fundamental components in a way that 's beautiful . " Although all plasma gasification systems recapture syngas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system seems to be ahead of the pack in its ability to economically convert the substance into eco-friendly and competitively priced fuels . " A lot of other gasification technologies require multiple steps . This is a one-step process , " says Patrick Davis of the U.S. Department of Energy 's office of hydrogen production and delivery , which has awarded Longo 's company almost $1 million in research grants . " You put the waste in the reactor and you get out the syngas . That 's it . " THE GARBAGE MAN After his tour of duty in Korea , Longo put himself through night school at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute . In 1959 , engineering degree in hand , he got a job at American Machine &; Foundry ( AMF )  --  the same company that today runs the world 's largest chain of bowling alleys  --  designing hardened silos for nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles , such as Titan and Minuteman . " There was never a time I can remember when I did n't want to be an engineer , " he says . For years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the garbage business ( as manager of new product development , he was charged with investigating growth areas ) . " I knew a lot about the industry , how backward it was , " he says . The costs to collect and transport waste were climbing . He was sure there had to be a better way . In 1967 Longo quit his job at AMF to start his own business , called International Dynetics . The name might not be familiar , but its product should : Longo designed and built the world 's first industrial-size trash compactors . " If you live in a high-rise or apartment building and dump your trash down a chute , " he says , " it 's probably going into one of our compactors . " When Longo started his company , it was still easier and cheaper to just haul the loose trash to the dump . But gas prices climbed , inflation increased , and soon , business boomed . In a few years , there were thousands of International Dynetics compactors operating around the world . The machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash into a cube that was about the size of a small television . " Our purpose was to condense it so it would be easier and cost less to bring to a landfill , " he says . Then , in 1972 , Longo read a paper in a science journal about fusion reactors . " The authors speculated that plasma might be used to destroy waste to the elemental level someday in the future , " he recalls . " That was like a spear in the heart , because we had just got our patents out for our trash compactors , and these guys were already saying there 's a prettier girl coming to town , " he says . " It would make obsolete everything we were doing . I resisted looking at the technology for 10 years . But by 1984 , it became obvious that plasma could do some serious work . " By then , the principal component of today 's plasma gasification systems , the plasma torch , had become widespread in the metal-fabrication industry , where it is used as a cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time were focused on ways to improve plasma torches for manipulating metals . But Longo had trash on the brain  --  whole landfills of trash . He was intent on developing a system that used plasma to convert waste into energy on a large scale . So he jumped ship again . In 1988 Longo sold International Dynetics and founded Startech . PLASMA TO THE PEOPLE " People kept asking me , " If this is so good , Longo , then why is n't everyone already using one ? ' " he says , referring to himself in the third person , a device he relies on frequently to emphasize his point . " We had the technical capability , but we did n't have a product yet . Just because we could do the trick did n't mean it was worth doing . " Trucking garbage to dumps and landfills was still cheap . Environmental concerns were n't on the public radar the way they are today , and landfills and incinerators were n't yet widely seen as public menaces . " We outsourced the parts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we told the manufacturers we were working with plasma , some of them thought it had something to do with blood and AIDS . " Longo describes the development curve as " relentless . " He teamed up with another engineer who had experience in the waste industry and an interest in plasma technology . " We did n't have computers . We did everything on drafting boards . But I was aggressive . And the more we did , the more it compelled us to continue . " It took almost a decade of R &D; until they had a working prototype . " I felt like St. Peter bringing the message out , " Longo says of his first sales calls . In 1997 the U.S. Army became Startech 's inaugural customer , buying a converter to dispose of chemical weapons at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland . A second reactor went to Japan for processing polychlorinated biphenyls , or PCBs , an industrial coolant and lubricant banned in the U.S since 1977 ( " really nasty stuff , " Longo says ) . Longo realized early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine that could handle anything . Some of the most noxious chemicals , he knew from his decades in the garbage industry , are found in the most mundane places , like household solid waste . Startech has an edge over some of its competitors because its converter does n't have to be reconfigured for different materials , which means operators do n't have to presort waste , a costly and time-consuming process . To achieve this adaptability , Startech converters crank the plasma arc up to an extremely high operating temperature : 30,0000F . Getting that temperature just right was one of Longo 's key developmental challenges . " You ca n't rely on the customer to tell you what they put in , " Longo says . " Sometimes they do n't know , sometimes they lie , and sometimes they 've thrown in live shotgun shells from a hunting trip . That 's why it 's imperative that the Plasma Converter can take in anything . " A video camera mounted near the top of the converter at the Bristol plant gives me a glimpse of the plasma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the converter , Lynch taps a few commands into a keyboard , and a loud hiss fills the room , the sound of steam being released from behind a pressurized valve . " You can use that steam to heat your facility and neighboring buildings , " he says proudly . Next to him is an LCD monitor with a live video feed from inside the reactor . A vivid magenta glow fills the screen as I watch the plasma torch vaporize a bucket of cellphones and soda cans . A hopper at the top of the vessel dumps another load into the plasma reactor , and seconds later , it vanishes too . " The idea , " Lynch says , " is that regardless of what you put in the front end , what comes out will be clean and ready to use for whatever you want . " I 've watched him operate the converter for nearly an hour , and I 'm still stunned to see no smoke , no flames , no ash , no pollution of any kind  --  all that 's left is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . CATCHING THE LITTER BUG Low transportation costs , cheap land , weak environmental regulations  --  these factors help explain why it took plasma until now to catch on as an economically sensible strategy to dispose of waste . " The steep increase in energy prices over the past two years is what has made this technology viable , " says Hilburn Hillestad , president of Geoplasma . His company , which touts the slogan " waste destruction at the speed of lightning with energy to share , " is negotiating a deal with St. Lucie County , Florida , to erect a $425-million plasma gasification system near a local landfill . The plant in St. Lucie County will be large enough to devour all 2,000 tons of daily trash generated by the county and polish off an additional 1,000 tons a day from the old landfill . Of course , the technology , still unproven on a large scale , has its skeptics . " That obsidian-like slag contains toxic heavy metals and breaks down when exposed to water , " claims Brad Van Guilder , a scientist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates for clean air and water . " Dump it in a landfill , and it could one day contaminate local groundwater . " Others wonder about the cleanliness of the syngas . " In the cool-down phases , the components in the syngas could reform into toxins , " warns Monica Wilson , the international coordinator for the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives , in Berkeley , California . None of this seems to worry St. Lucie County 's solid-waste director , Leo Cordeiro . " We 'll get all our garbage to disappear , and our landfill will be gone in 20 years , " he tells me . The best part : Geoplasma is footing the entire bill . " We 'll generate 160 megawatts a day from the garbage , " Hillestad says , " but we 'll consume only 40 megawatts to run the plant . We 'll sell the net energy to the local power grid . " Sales from excess electricity might allow Geoplasma to break even in 20 years . In New York , Carmen Cognetta , an attorney with the city council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help offset some of the city 's exorbitant waste costs . " All the landfalls around New York have closed , incinerators are banned , and we are trucking our trash to Virginia and Pennsylvania , " he explains . " That is costing the city $400 million a year . We could put seven or eight of these converters in the city , and that would be enough . " The syngas from the converters , Cognetta says , could be tapped for hydrogen gas to power buses or police cars . But the decision-making bureaucracy can be slow , and it is hamstrung by the politically well-connected waste-disposal industry . " Many landfill operators are used to getting a million dollars a month out of debris , " says U.S. Energy 's Paul Marazzo . " They do n't want a converter to happen because they 'll lose their revenue . " Meanwhile , Victor Sziky , the president of Sicmar International , an investment firm based in Panama , is working with the Panamanian government to set up at least 10 Startech systems there . " The garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Sziky , who lives in Panama City . " We have obsolete incinerators , and landfills that are polluting groundwater and drinking water . We 've had outbreaks of cholera and hepatitis A and B directly attributed to the waste in landfills . There Yellow Magenta are a lot of people in a small country , and there 's no infrastructure to deal with it . " The project will be capable of destroying 200 tons of trash a day at each location , enough to handle all the garbage for the municipalities involved  --  and , says Sziky , to produce up to 40 percent of their electrical demand . Panama 's syngas will probably be converted to hydrogen and sold to industrial suppliers . The current market for hydrogen is at least $50 billion worldwide , a figure that is expected to grow by 5 to 10 percent annually , according to the National Hydrogen Association , an industry and research consortium . Analysts at Fuji-Keizai USA , a market-research firm for emerging technologies , predict that the domestic market will hit $1.6 billion by 2010 , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick Davis says that when the long-awaited hydrogen-powered vehicles finally arrive , the demand for hydrogen Cyan Black will soar . But he also notes that to have an effect on global warming , it 's critical that hydrogen come from clean sources . That 's one more idea that 's old news to Longo , who , as usual , is 10 steps ahead of the game , already embedded in a future where fossil fuels are artifacts of a bygone era . For the past several years , he has been developing the Starcell , a filtration mechanism that slaps onto the back end of his converter and quickly refines syngas into hydrogen . As he says , " We are the disruptive technology . " Longo has been working in garbage for 40 years , making his fortune by literally scraping the bottom of the barrel . Which is , it turns out , the perfect vantage point for finding new ways to turn what to most of us is just garbage into arguably the most valuable thing in the world : clean energy . In January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOX THREE KEY FACTS 1 America now generates 245 million tons of municipal solid waste every year  --  twice as much as 35 years ago . 2 Startech reduces trash into its constituent components by using plasma energy to tear apart molecular bonds . 3 The process creates more electricity than it consumes , allowing companies to profit from selling excess power . BOX HOW IT WORKS The Plasma Converter STARTECH 'S TRASH converter uses superheated plasma  --  an electrically conductive mass of charged particles ( ions and electrons ) generated from ordinary air  --  to reduce garbage to its molecular components . First the trash is fed into an auger that shreds it into small pieces . Then the mulch is delivered into the plasma chamber , where the superheated plasma converts it into two by-products . One is a syngas composed mostly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide , which is fed into the adjacent Starcell system to be converted into fuel . The other is molten glass that can be sold for use in household tiles or road asphalt .
