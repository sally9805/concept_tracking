Chapter One Long ago you came to me , a miracle of firsts ; First smiles and teeth and baby steps , a sunbeam on the burst . But one day you will move away and leave to me your past , And I will be left thinking of a lifetime of your lasts ... The last time that I held a bottle to your baby lips , The last time that I lifted you and held you on my hip . The last night when you woke up crying , needing to be walked . When last you crawled up with your blanket , wanting to be rocked . The last time when you ran to me , still small enough to hold . The last time that you said you 'd marry me when you grew old . Precious , simple moments and bright flashes from your past- Would I have held on longer if I 'd known they were your last ? One last adventure to the park , your final midday nap , The last time when you wore your favorite faded baseball cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . So what about tomorrow- will I recognize your lasts ? The last time that you talk to me about your hopes and dreams . The last time that you wear a jersey for your high school team . I 've watched you grow and barely noticed seasons as the pass . If I could freeze the hands of time , I 'd hold on to your lasts . For come some bright fall morning , you 'll be going far away . College life will beckon in a brilliant sort of way . One last hug , one last good-bye , one quick and hurried kiss . One last time to understand just how much you 'll be missed . I 'll watch you leave and think how fast our time together passed . ( Continues ... )
