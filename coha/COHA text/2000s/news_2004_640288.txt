<p> First Data Corp . chief executive Charlie Fote and Rep. Tom Tancredo , R-Colo. , are both the grandsons of Italian immigrants and consider immigration a critical public policy issue . <p> Their views just happen to be polar opposites . <p> First Data , based in Greenwood Village , earns billions of dollars a year from its international Western Union money transfer business . <p> Tancredo , a Littleton Republican who represents the 6th Congressional District in which First Data has its headquarters , has built his political career on ideas to control immigration . <p> He recently proposed taxing remittances  --  the billions of dollars that workers send each year from the United States to their families and friends in Mexico and other countries . Such a move could have hurt First Data 's business . <p> Tancredo quickly backed off the trial balloon of remittance taxation and now recommends that U.S. foreign aid be offset by the money that workers in the U.S. send abroad . Fote and First Data oppose that proposal , as well . <p> Meanwhile , First Data employees have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Tancredo 's Democratic opponent in the fall election . <p> The political action highlights how First Data , once content to remain a behind- the-scenes player , is strategically and openly inserting itself into the immigration debate . <p> " In the end , political support is a matter of choice , and we will support the individual who we believe best reflects the interests of our business and this district , " Fote said in an e-mail to The Denver Post . <p> Tancredo counters that his intent with the remittance tax proposal was not to harm First Data , which employs 2,700 people locally and expects to pull down $ 10 billion in revenues this year . <p> " Really and truly , it had nothing to do with them , " Tancredo said . " I did not purposely do anything to hurt their bottom line . Nobody was talking about taxing Western Union or First Data . " " Voices were n't being heard " The skirmish with Tancredo is just one in a series of moves by First Data to shape the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected immigration reform as our jumping-off point because it 's an issue that 's important to a very large customer group , and we felt their voices were n't being heard , " Fote said . <p> First Data is Colorado 's biggest company by market capitalization , valued at $ 38.5 billion . It provides back-end transaction processing for more than 3.5 million merchants and has the country 's largest ATM and debit-card network . <p> It 's the world 's largest provider of money transfers  --  through its Western Union subsidiary  --  with 188,000 agent locations in 195 countries . <p> In March , Fote spoke at the National Press Club and unveiled a new $ 10 million First Data Empowerment Fund to help immigrant communities and foster an " enlightened " discussion of immigration . <p> Fote argued at the time for more humane treatment of immigrants and for eliminating the backlog in families wanting to move to the U.S. legally . <p> Fote is personally hosting a series of immigration reform forums across the country , including sessions in Chicago on July 21 and in Denver on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information Clearinghouse in Denver to assist Latino entrepreneurs and is working on initiatives to teach families in developing countries how to leverage the funds they receive from relatives abroad . <p> The moves have earned accolades from immigrant groups , who point to First Data as the only Fortune 500 company willing to take a public stand on the subject . <p> " First Data is very courageous and proving to be a gallant leader in our community , " said Polly Baca , executive director of the Latin American Research and Service Agency in Denver . " They are addressing one of the most critical issues in our state and nation . " Baca said that First Data has brought various sides of the immigration debate together without trying to push the dialogue in a predetermined direction . <p> But one direction that First Data 's side of the dialogue will most likely never go is toward Tancredo 's position of stronger limits on immigration to the U.S. <p> Tancredo proposed placing a 5 percent tax on remittances last month after reading a Washington Post article detailing how individuals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Latin America . <p> " If the report is correct , even a small levy on remittances could generate millions or even billions of dollars for things like better border enforcement , " Tancredo said in May . <p> Fred Niehaus , First Data 's senior vice president of public affairs , said Tancredo 's tax proposal surprised the company and challenged its interests . <p> Tancredo said that he does n't design policy based on the interest of any single company , even if that company is the largest in his district . <p> " We do n't do business that way , " he said . " We do n't go to corporations first and say I am thinking about this . You try to think about what is best for the country . " However , Tancredo has shelved that plan in favor of a legislative proposal that would reduce U.S. foreign aid by the money a country receives in remittances . <p> More than 60 percent of the 16.5 million Latin American-born adults living in the U.S. send money back to their home countries about once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sergio Bendixen , a Florida pollster who researched the topic for the Inter-American Development Bank . <p> Of the $ 30 billion total estimated to be sent by those individuals annually , about $ 544 million comes from Colorado , Bendixen said . <p> By comparison , USAID , the agency responsible for directing foreign assistance , requested $ 805 million in next year 's budget for the entire region . <p> Bendixen argues that remittances benefit both the countries receiving them and the U.S. , a position that First Data supports . <p> " The only way you are going to curb illegal immigration to the U.S. is to foster the economic development of Latin America , " he said . <p> Tancredo disagrees , and argues that remittances actually encourage illegal immigration . There are an estimated 8 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. , according to the U.S. Census Bureau . <p> In some countries , money transfers represent the largest or second-largest source of national income  --  even ahead of tourism , Tancredo said . <p> Nations that get large flows of money from abroad have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic self-sufficiency , Tancredo said . <p> As a result , he says , those foreign governments encourage workers to cross the U.S. border illegally and drain billions of dollars from the U.S. economy . <p> Executives at First Data 's Western Union , which transferred 14 percent of the $ 151 billion in global remittances last year , see it differently . <p> It 's a key reason why First Data Corporation Employees for Responsible Government , the political action committee , was launched a month ago , Niehaus said . <p> The committee has raised $ 22,500 so far , with contributions given to candidates including President Bush ; Rep. Chris Cannon , R-Utah ; Sen. Ted Kennedy , D-Mass. ; and $ 2,000 to Tancredo 's Democratic opponent this fall  --  Joanna Conti . <p> Conti calls First Data 's support " very significant " and criticized Tancredo 's stance on immigration issues . <p> " This is his crusade , not the district 's crusade , " Conti said . " Our immigration policy is broken . Most people would agree that we need to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little chance of winning a district where 46 percent of voters are registered Republicans and just 23 percent are registered Democrats . <p> Tancredo handily beat his Democratic opponent Lance Wright in the 2002 election , winning two-thirds of the vote . <p> That may be why Tancredo does n't view Conti as a threat to his serving a fourth term and takes First Data 's overt opposition in stride . <p> " I live in a live-and-let-live world , " Tancredo said . " I want them to do what they need to do . I have to do what I have to do . " A risky endeavor Niehaus admits that First Data 's reputation could suffer if the immigration reforms backed by the company fail . <p> While corporations may take public policy positions that serve their interests , they do n't often confront public officials in the open . <p> " It is rare that you hear about these things coming out and happening , " said Katie Kimberling , director of operations at Wilson Research Strategies in Oklahoma City . <p> Larry Sabato , director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company would n't challenge a sitting member of Congress lightly . <p> " When you challenge a politician who has significant power in the majority caucus , which Tancredo does , you are taking a chance , " he said . <p> Shareholders could balk at the company 's activist position , and so could people who agree with Tancredo 's stance . <p> Corporate America is n't behind enforcing existing immigration policies , said Craig Nelsen , director of ProjectUSA , a group opposed to accepting foreign identification cards to open bank accounts in the United States . <p> " There is no money in enforcing immigration law , " Nelsen said . " It is all in the other side , in circumventing it , increasing it or turning a blind eye to it . " Fote counters that immigrants strengthen the U.S. economy , diversify the social fabric of society and must be treated fairly . <p> In the past , First Data has focused primarily on growing its business , but it now is in a position where it can advocate for its customers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Sure , we risk criticism from those people who disagree with our work in the area of immigration reform , " Fote said . " We 're prepared to face that criticism , but the fact is we believe what we 're doing is the right thing to do .
