Oh my God . <p> Oh my God . <p> My hair is orange . <p> How could this happen ? <p> I applied the dye carefully in sections , ran it all the way through to the ends , and left it on for exactly fifteen minutes . I wore the stupid plastic gloves and used the timer on my kitchen stove to make sure it did n't overprocess . <p> And it turns orange ? <p> Damn it ! <p> Calm down . Breathe . It 's not so bad . It 's not orange , per se . It 's . . . auburn . Slightly amber . Burnt sienna , really . <p> Stop fooling yourself , Bella . It 's orange , you idiot . <p> " Crap ! " My voice echoes around the small , product-laden bathroom , every available inch of counter space smothered with bottles of mousse , antiaging serum , eye cream , and mascara , and I wonder if my roommate Emily Tyler can hear me . Her bedroom is down the hallway , but our walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls accusingly , " Bella ? What did you do ? " <p> " Nothing ! It 's nothing ! I just . . . uh , tripped ! " I yell back , my heart skipping beats as I envision the ribbing I 'll have to endure if my best friend walks in and sees the catastrophe my beauty " skills " have caused . She 'd never let me live it down . <p> I need to fix this immediately . I am a beauty writer . I am supposed to be able to handle something as elementary as dyeing my hair without ending up with a pumpkin on my head . This is much worse than the unfortunate time I burned off my eyebrows trying to dye them blonde . If I show up tonight at my profile interview for the New York Post looking like this , I will become a laughingstock of the beauty industry , and my editor , Larissa Lincoln , will inevitably decide I have no business writing my monthly The Beauty Expert column for EnchantT , and she will fire me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no income and will not be able to afford living in New York . I 'll be homeless . Worse , I 'll have to go back to Ohio . My life will be ruined ! <p> And all because of a stupid dye job ! Damn it . <p> I silently berate myself for freaking out . Get it together , Bella . It 's just hair . <p> What to do ? Dye it back to blonde ? Half my hair might fall out . Besides , the whole point of my assignment is to see what it 's like being brunette . <p> Why ? Why did I decide to do this two hours before my interview ? I went to Northwestern . I have a degree in journalism . I am , at least , theoretically , intelligent , although lately it seems like nothing I do reflects this . So how do I end up in situations like this time and time again ? My father 's voice floats through my head , clear as crystal , pulling me back fifteen years to a dinner with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but does n't have much common sense . Now , Susan , on the other hand . She is the elder child , after all . . . " My mother squeezed my hand under the table as she interjected , " Chuck , please do n't compare the girls ! They each have their own gifts . " Yes , indeed . Where shall I collect my first-class prize for being a total spaz ? <p> I have an hour to fix this before I have to hop in a cab and rush down to Pamplona , the magazine industry hot spot I 'm meeting the Post reporter at . Even if I wanted to dye it back and then fix it tomorrow , I would n't have time to blow it out . And in any case , I 'm going to be photographed , so I 'm definitely not going to make the mistake of trusting my own dyeing skills again . I 'm getting my first big profile piece , in one of the most widely read , influential papers in the country . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vat of carrot juice . <p> Can I wear a hat ? I do n't own any hats . I hate hats . Showing up in a hat is even more embarrassing than showing up with orange hair . What about a head scarf ? Jackie O wore head scarfs . Princess Grace wore head scarfs . It 's very Monaco circa 1971 and is so ridiculously out there that I think it might work . The photographer will probably think I 'm just another diva , self-absorbed , magazine head case . <p> I run into my bedroom and yank open the top drawers of my wooden dresser , rummaging frantically through them . Through the years , I 've accumulated countless fancy scarves that I 've never once worn , all sent by beauty publicists as thank-yous for stories written about their products . Finally , they 'll come in handy . <p> I dump the scarves onto my bed and spread them out , surveying the stock before picking out two possibilities . Tan and cream silk HermFs dotted with chain links ? Or psychedelic blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Pucci projects more of an image  --  a style moment . This , I can work with  --  all I need to complete the look is an A-line coat , shift dress , knee-high boots , and sunglasses . It 's more than a little costumey , but after years of holding court at photo shoots , I know that the getup will at least photograph well . Very retro . <p> Wrapping the scarf around my head is more complex than I 'd anticipated , however . How do celebrities do it so effortlessly ? I try tying the ends around my chin , but I look like Queen Elizabeth with her dogs . Tying the ends behind my head near the nape of my neck simply makes me look like a Von Trapp . <p> Fifteen minutes of playing with the scarf yields nothing . I 've mastered the Erykah Badu  --  thing , but not the St. **34;585;TOOLONG thing . <p> I only have half an hour left . The restaurant will inevitably be crawling with other editors and it 's too late to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer  --  so obvious that I ca n't believe I did n't think of it immediately  --  pops in my head : Nick . <p> <br> Continues ...
