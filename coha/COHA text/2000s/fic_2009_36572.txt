Peter Kramer , whose year mapping the jungles of Central America included a monthlong stay in an unair-conditioned hospital with a fever of 104 , found it impossible to suck down more than short little <br> gasps of hot air . Evelyn Burns , professor of biology at Harvard University , spent the first day lecturing everyone about the tolerability of dry heat ( 105 in Arizona being nothing compared to 90 in Boston ) , then vomited five minutes into the first windstorm . Dr. and Mrs. Lloyd Frankel , river veterans , lay on their sleeping mats in stunned oblivion to the velvety orange wasps that scurried in blind circles on the hot <br> sand between them . And Amy Van Doren , who unbeknownst to her mother had weighed in at 237 pounds on the hotel spa scale the night <br> before the trip , rigorously shook the bottle of hot sauce over everything on her plate , for she knew that chile peppers made you sweat , <br> which in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose a few pounds . <br> JT , the head guide , had seen it all before . This being his 125th trip down the Colorado River , he 'd witnessed time and again the universal <br> zombielike walk of his guests at the end of the day when they staggered up the beach in search of a campsite . He called it the Death <br> Walk and always reminded his fellow guides not to expect much volunteer help in the first few days of any July trip , as guests acclimated to the suffocating conditions of the Grand Canyon . It was simply a matter of physiology : the human body was n't designed to go from a comfortable air-conditioned existence to the prehistoric inferno of canyon life in a day . When his heat-stomped campers marveled at his energy , he kept at what he was doing and raised an eyebrow and said , " You 'll adjust . " <br> JT was a man of few words . <br> At night it was so hot you slept without a blanket , or even a sheet , for well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun-baked canyon walls . In early morning , as people shook out their clothes for scorpions , the air could feel temperate , and they might be <br> fine in just a bathing suit ; but as soon as the sun 's rays came barreling over the canyon walls , out came the long-sleeved cotton shirts , which got repeatedly dunked in the river , wrung out , and worn , soaked to chill , until sundown . <br> During the midday furnace , when even the guides crawled into whatever shade they could find and collectively dreamt of that first brisk morning in October when you could see your breath , JT himself would confront the heat head-on . Alone in his raft , he would kneel against the side tubes with his arms draped over the edge , staring in a kind of rapt hypnosis at the sheer walls across the river . Something in <br> the flat midday light , he 'd found , caused them to eventually start floating upstream , a mirage of the mind until he blinked , and then they <br> would snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstream again . It was a game he played , a game he 'd never reveal to <br> anyone lest they think him soft , or spiritual , or just plain wacky . <br> But in fact he was all three . JT Maroney 's heart was in those walls , and had been since his first trip thirty-five years ago when someone <br> handed him a life jacket and a paddle and said , " Are you coming or not ? " It was in the polished maroon cliffs of Marble Canyon , the dusty <br> tan layers of Coconino sandstone ; it was embedded forever in the shimmering black walls of the Inner Gorge , Land of the Giants . It was <br> in the scorpions and the velvet wasps and the stinging red ants that sent you running for a vial of ammonia ; it was in the feathery tamarisk <br> trees and the canyon wrens ' falling notes and the grumpy blackwinged California condor he spotted without fail as they passed under Navajo Bridge the first day of every trip . It was in the tug of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boat ; it was in the <br> sunlit droplets that danced above the roar of big water . <br> Each trip changed him a little . This trip would change him a lot . It would change everyone , in ways no one could have anticipated . <br> But on the Fourth of July , at the beginning of JT 's 125th trip , it was n't about change . It was about drinking beer and eating pie and dreaming up new ways to fly the Stars and Stripes over the grandest river in the West . <br> 1 <br> Lee 's Ferry <br> Mile 0 <br> Up at Lee 's Ferry , the night before the trip , JT sat on the side tube of his eighteen-foot neoprene raft , popped open a beer , and tried to remember exactly how many times he 'd flipped his raft in Hermit . <br> Deep in the Inner Gorge , ninety-five miles downstream , the runoff boulders from Hermit Creek collided with the Colorado River to create one of the longest hydraulic roller coasters in the canyon , wave after wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a tendency to curl back upon itself , something that could easily flip a boat . JT 's goal was always to punch straight on through , aiming for just enough of a wild ride to give his passengers a thrill without actually flipping . Trouble was , sometimes the ride got ahead of itself , and JT hit that fifth wave with maybe too much weight in the back , and suddenly there they were , rising up , hovering in midair with water roaring all around and JT heaving his weight into the oars even as he felt them go back and over : down into the churning froth , getting maytagged and then popping up into the light , always disoriented until he spotted the white underside of his raft , which was usually right there beside him . And so it was , more than just a few times in his life as a guide , and although there were always a few who subsequently wanted off , now , what made it all worthwhile was seeing the expressions on the others ' faces as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raft  --  expressions of shock , adrenaline , joy , fear , joy , excitement , and did he mention joy ? Because that 's what it was , usually : the sheer exultation of surviving a swim in the most powerful river in the northern hemisphere . <br> JT tallied up the times he 'd flipped . Five in all , if his memory served him well . <br> Draining his beer , he tossed the empty can onto a tarp on the beach and reached into the mesh drag bag for another . The sun was still high in the sky , the water a deep turtle green , achy cold if you left your foot in for more than a few seconds . Across the river , tan hills sloped up from the water 's edge , speckled with pion and sage and juniper ; downstream , salmon pink cliffs marked the beginning of Marble Canyon . <br> JT was the lead boatman for this trip , the Trip Leader , and as such he was the one who made all the important day-to-day decisions : where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd schedule a layover day . If there was a problem passenger , JT was responsible for reigning him in ; if someone got hurt , JT decided whether to evacuate . JT figured he was good for two trips per season as lead boatman ; you got paid a little more , but you never really slept . <br> Up on the beach , Dixie and Abo , his fellow guides , worked together stuffing tents one by one into a large rubberized bag . JT was tired and hungry and wished briefly that they were cooking him a good dinner instead . After a long morning spent loading up the truck back at the warehouse in Flagstaff , they 'd driven the three hours to Lee 's Ferry , where they worked the entire afternoon rigging their boats in the hot desert sun . The beach at Lee 's Ferry was the only put-in point on the river , so it was crowded with people and boats : two fat motorized rafts , a dozen or so durable eighteen-footers , and a flotilla of colorful kayaks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes , waterproof bags , paddles , oars , life jackets , water jugs  --  that it resembled a paddlers ' flea market . Yet despite the mayhem , everybody seemed to know what was what and whose was whose , and JT knew that by ten o ' clock tomorrow , all this gear would be stowed in its rightful place on the boats . <br> High in the sky , a turkey vulture slowly circled , its white-tipped wings spread wide . The people on the motor rig had set up lawn chairs and opened umbrellas for shade , but nobody was sitting down ; there was too much work to be done , although they did it with a beer in hand . Up on the beach , Abo , his paddle captain , was mending a book with duct tape , while Dixie , who would be rowing their third boat , was assembling their picnic dinner . She wore a yellow bathing suit top and a blue sarong knotted low on her hips ; wet braids curled at her shoulders . <br> " How come there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Four for me , one for you and JT to split , " said Abo . <br> " Well , someone 's going hungry , " said Dixie , " and it is n't going to be me . " <br> JT smiled to himself . He was glad to have these two for his crew . Abo , who could always be counted on to loosen up a group , was thirty-five , tall and bony-legged , with bleachy-tipped brown hair and clear blue eyes . Nobody knew his real name . He was a farm boy from the Midwest who 'd come out to study geology at the University of Arizona , then took a river trip and never went back to school . During the winter , he built houses and scavenged work up at the ski area . Reputedly , he had a son by a woman in California , a movie producer whom Abo had met on an earlier trip . He was a good guide , in JT 's view ; not only did he make people laugh , but as an amateur geologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . <br> Dixie , whose real name was just that , Dixie Ann Gillis , was twenty-seven . She was relatively new with the company , and he 'd only done one other trip with her , but he 'd been impressed when he watched her rescue a private boater from the Rock Garden below Crystal Rapid . She had strong opinions about a lot of things , and JT liked that about her . If you caught him with his guard down , JT might admit that he was half in love with Dixie , but she had a boyfriend down in Tucson whose picture she kept taped to the inside of her personal ammo box , and JT was n't one to mess with somebody else 's good thing . Besides , after 124 trips , JT knew how things worked in the canyon , knew you could fall in love at the drop of a hat , literally , before you even got through Marble Canyon . It was a guide 's life to fall in love , he knew ; he 'd done his share , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was to stand back and not get caught up in things , trip after trip after trip . <br> JT unlatched the ammo box by his feet and took out the passenger list and scanned the names and notes . They were supposed to have fourteen passengers on the trip , but at the last minute one couple had canceled , which meant he was going to have to juggle the seating arrangements to balance out the boats . There were two vegetarians , three " no dairy , " one " high craving for red meat . " Most had no rafting experience , which did n't surprise him ; but one could n't swim , which did . There were two kids , which pleased him ; kids usually brought a goofy spirit absent in adults , who too easily fell victim to excessive reverence for natural wonders . He made a mental note to assign the boys a job  --  can-smasher , maybe  --  so they could feel useful and independent from their parents . <br> He continued scanning . There was a couple from Wyoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was allergic to peanuts , furry animals , grasses , and pollen . Well , hopefully she was bringing along a box of Benadryl and an EpiPen or two . There was a mother and daughter , Susan and Amy . The one who could n't swim was a young man from Ohio named Peter , age twenty-seven , traveling solo . <br> Noting Peter 's age , JT glanced up at Dixie , who was reknotting her sarong . Do n't even think of it , he heard himself telling Peter . Do n't even try . <br> That evening , as the sky grew dark , boaters from all the groups gathered together and passed around a bottle of whiskey , sharing old stories , inventing new ones . Around nine thirty , JT , who 'd passed on the second round , returned to his raft . He brushed his teeth , then unrolled his sleeping bag across the long , flat meat cooler that spanned the center of his boat . Even though it was dark , the day 's heat continued to radiate off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and carefully and methodically dried off his feet . He rubbed them well with bee balm , then pulled on a pair of clean socks to keep his skin from cracking . Finally he stretched out on top of his sleeping bag . He settled back and locked his hands behind his head and gazed up at the spattered current of stars above . A warm breeze fanned his skin , and he picked out constellations : the Big Dipper , Cassiopeia , the busy little Pleiades . <br> Up on the beach , a burst of laughter erupted from the revelers , but by now his eyes had begun to twitch and blur . He fought to keep them open , to watch just a little bit more of the star show , but within minutes he was fast asleep . <br> Continues ...
