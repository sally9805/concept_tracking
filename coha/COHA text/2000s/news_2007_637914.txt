<p> CLAREMONT , N.H.  --  For Arizona Sen. John McCain , it 's back to basics . <p> His presidential campaign nearly broke , stripped of staff and on a slide in state and national polls , he pleaded his case and fielded questions for more than an hour Saturday before about 100 New Hampshire residents gathered in the second-floor meeting room at American Legion Post 29 . <p> In place of the nationwide organizations and TV ads some of his top rivals air , he 'll rely on town hall meetings like the ones that propelled him to victory in the New Hampshire primary in his first presidential bid in 2000 . <p> Faye Bopp , 57 , voted for him then but is n't sure about this time . " I really respect him , but that does n't mean I agree with him on everything , " especially the war in Iraq , she says as she waits for McCain to arrive . " I want to bring our troops home . " <p> McCain insists he is in the presidential race to stay  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw , he says  --  and his gallows humor remains intact . As reporters crowd around him with questions about his campaign 's financial woes and the departure of top aides , he finally replies , " You mean , in the words of Chairman Mao , it 's always darkest before it 's totally black ? " <p> So what next ? <p> McCain and members of his inner circle say he has a strategy that depends , at the moment , on simply surviving for the next few months as the 2008 campaign sorts out . <p> " The good news is it 's a wide-open race , " says Charlie Black , a veteran Republican strategist and McCain adviser . No other top contender  --  former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani , former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney or prospective candidate Fred Thompson , a former Tennessee senator  --  has a decisive claim to the Republican nomination yet . <p> Mark McKinnon , who was President Bush 's media strategist and counsels McCain , says a comeback campaign " reinforces what voters like about John McCain , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds are long . <p> McCain 's plan : <p> * " Strip it to the chassis . " Those are McKinnon 's words , reflecting more necessity than choice . Since campaign manager Terry Nelson and chief strategist John Weaver left last week , other staffers have followed , and McCain is braced for more resignations to be announced today . <p> A preliminary campaign budget drawn up in November and reported Saturday in The Washington Post predicted that McCain , at the time seen as the front-runner , would have raised $71 million by now and spent $26 million . Instead , $24 million has been raised , and nearly all of it is gone . Second-quarter financial reports were due at the Federal Election Commission by midnight Sunday . <p> McCain says he 's considering whether to accept campaign matching funds  --  and with them federal restrictions on spending  --  but he rules out borrowing from his family 's assets . <p> McCain will have a leaner staff and bare-bones operation . Though he had traveled to some campaign events on chartered planes , he flew to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rented SUV . <p> *Focus on three states . McCain says he 'll narrow his focus to the three states with the opening contests : Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina . The theory is that momentum from an early win will sweep through later primaries . <p> He starts from behind . According to recent statewide polls aggregated by political website RealClearPolitics , McCain runs third in New Hampshire , third in South Carolina and fourth in Iowa  --  a state whose contest he skipped in 2000 . He has announced he wo n't compete in a straw poll in Iowa next month . <p> His prospects for a turnaround in Iowa are " mixed at best , " says Steve Roberts , a member of the Republican National Committee and former state GOP chairman . The caucuses put a premium on an extensive grass-roots organization . <p> In South Carolina , where McCain lost the primary to George W. Bush in 2000 , his support of an immigration bill that would have provided a path to legal status for illegal immigrants has cost him dearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much lipstick you put on that pig , you still are n't going to want to kiss it , " Dawson says . <p> *Change the conversation . McCain 's support of staying the course in Iraq has eroded his standing among independents , and his stance on immigration has done the same among conservative Republicans . When he opened the town hall meeting in Claremont , McCain detailed his views on other priorities  --  addressing climate change , curtailing government spending and helping displaced workers  --  before mentioning the war . <p> When a man in the audience asked about immigration , McCain said he had learned " a bitter lesson , " then corrected himself . " Not a bitter lesson ; we learned a lesson " during the immigration debate . <p> He said he was ready to take a piecemeal approach rather than seek comprehensive legislation , first addressing border security and then , perhaps , trying to enact a temporary worker program for agriculture . <p> Earlier , McCain told reporters that the immigration issue was no longer going to be " on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Senate . He said the Iraq issue would change , too , for better or worse . <p> " We 're either going to show some success , or we 're going to be forced out ; everybody knows that , " McCain said . " Conflicts , wars , are never static . They move in one direction or another . " <p> The same could be said of presidential campaigns . <p> Orson Swindle , a friend of McCain since they were cellmates as POWs during the Vietnam War , says McCain is determined to persevere despite predictions of his campaign 's demise . <p> " He 's had six or eight near-death experiences in life , " Swindle says . In New Hampshire for the weekend to offer support , he watched the town hall meeting from the sidelines . " He 's not going away . " <p> PHOTO , B/W , Jim Cole , AP
