In 1894 a naval clash between China and Japan gave Western naval pundits a chance to see armored biggun warships tested against fast , lightly armed vessels with rapid-firing weapons . The results , however , were less than conclusive. // Throughout history naval battles have played decisive roles in the progress of nations . One of the lesser known but more important sea engagements occurred on September 17 , 1894 , between Chinese and Japanese warships off the coast of Manchuria , near the mouth of the Yalu River . The Sino-Japanese War arose from a dispute over the status of Korea . In 1885 China and Japan had negotiated a treaty whereby either country was permitted to send troops into Korea , provided notice of that intent was given , In the 1870s a newly awakened Japan had abandoned centuries of isolation , and after westernizing its military forces , was seeking any excuse to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the decaying Chinese empire . Separated from Japan by only 120 miles of ocean , Korea could be either a thorn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Japanese expansion on the Chinese mainland . On June 8 , 1894 , Korea asked China for aid in suppressing a religious uprising . China sent 1,500 troops to help quell the revolt and notified Japan of her action . Fearing that the Chinese had ulterior motives , the Japanese immediately shipped a 5,000-man military force to Korea . China demanded that Japan remove her troops , but the Japanese refused . The Chinese then sent 8,000 more of their own soldiers into Korea . In July Japan committed two audaciously provocative acts . On the 20th , her troops in Seoul seized control of the Korean government , while on the 25th the cruiser Naniwa , commanded by Captain Heihachiro Togo , intercepted Kowshing , a British steamer leased to the Chinese , drove off her escort@ sinking the sloop Kwang@Yi and damaging the protected cruiser Tui-Yuen in the process-and then sank the troopship . The Japanese rescued Kowshing 's British officers but machine-gunned more than 1,000 Chinese soldiers to death in their lifeboats or while they struggled in the water . The British press denounced Japan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . When international lawyers decreed that Togo had not exceeded his rights , on August I China declared war on Japan . At that time , China had a larger and more modem navy than Japan , but the imperial Manchu government and the military forces that served it were hamstrung by corruption and power struggles . The Chinese navy was divided into four squadrons , but only the Peiyang ( northern ) Fleet , based at Port Arthur , was under the control of the central government and could be employed during the war . Even so , supporters of the " big-gun " school of naval tactics were of the opinion that the Chinese fleet was more powerful than the lighter-armored and undergunned Japanese vessels . The Peiyang Fleet was under the command of Admiral Ting ju-ch'ang , a former cavalry officer who had received his naval command from Admiral-in-Chief Li Hungchang for political reasons , rather than for his limited Western naval training . Ting had two 7,430-ton battleships at his disposal : Ting-Yuen , which served as his flagship , and Chen-Yuen . Built in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mounted four 12- inch Krupp guns . The balance of Ting 's squadron consisted of the cruisers King-Yuen , LaiYuen , Chih-Yuen , Ching@Yuen , Tsi-Yuen and Kwang-Ping and the gun vessels Chao-Yung and Yang-Wei . Admiral Ting also had a small corvette and two torpedo boats for his use if necessary , In contrast to China 's ancient naval traditions , Japan did not establish a national seagoing navy until 1872 , and in 1894 it still had yet to be tested in battle . Commanded by Vice Adm . Yukiyo Ito , the fleet was divided into two squadrons . The Flying Squadron , with Rear Adm . Kozo Tsuboi in charge , consisted of four unarmored fast cruisers : Tsuboi 's flagship Yoshino , Takachiho , Nar@wa and Akitsushima . The Principal Squadron , under Ito 's direct command , was composed of cruisers Matsushima ( Ito 's flagship ) , Itsukushima , Hashidate , Chiyoda , Fuso and Hiei . Ito 's fleet also included one small corvette , Akagi , and the converted merchant ship Saiko Man . Both squadrons ' ships mounted 5- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the exceptions of Chiyoda , Fuso and Hiei-and they only had 5-inch armor belts . Matsushima , Itsukushima and Hashidate , designed by French shipbuilder Emile Bertin , each mounted one French-built Canet 12.6-inch gun in addition to their rapid-firing armament . An ongoing naval debate was about to be put to the test in the waters off Koreawhether fast , lightly armored ships with rapid-firing guns could outfight slower biggun vessels . The answer , however , would not be definitive for several reasons . While the Chinese ships looked smart and were nicely painted , they carried half-empty ammunition magazines and unpracticed gunners . Corrupt management in Chinese shell factories led to the production of shells that burst sporadically , since cement and coal dust were often packed into the projectiles instead of explosives . The Japanese officers and seamen , on the other hand , were highly trained and skillful . On September 16 , the Chinese fleet convoyed troops to Korea , landed them on the Western coast and then retired to the mouth of the Yalu River for the night . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Yellow Sea coast . To each fleet , the surrounding sea appeared to be empty . As darkness approached , Admiral Ito anchored his ships in the Pyongyang Inlet . Unknown to the Japanese , China 's Admira Ting had received instructions that he was not to cross a line between the Shantung lighthouse and the Yalu River . This meant that the Chinese squadron was confined to operating in the northwestern corner of the Yellow Sea . Ting resented the order , since it prevented his ships from seeking out the enemy fleet , whereas the Japanese vessels were free to roam the Yellow Sea at will . During the evening of the 16th , Ito received word that the Chinese ships had landed reinforcements only 100 miles away , on the eastern bank of the Yalu River . He immediately decided to take a dozen ships and make a sweep of Korea Bay . Monday morning , September 17 , dawned a beautiful day , with only a slight breeze ruffling the surface of the water . As the sun poked its way up the horizon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Japanese checked every cove and inlet but found no Chinese ships . Ito then changed course toward Talu Island , which was northeast of Haiyang and only a few miles from the mouth of the Yalu. // Vice Admiral Yukiyo Ito , commander of the Japanese Principal Squadron ( Anne S.

At about 9 a.m. , general quarters was sounded and the gun crews were given an att-too-rare and rather belated exercise in battle procedures . It was not until 11 a.m. , however , that the Chinese actually saw the enemy 's approach . " The cooks were preparing midday meal , when suddenly the smoke from enemy vessels was sighted by lookout men at the masthead of several ships , " wrote Commander Philo N. McGiffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard Chen-Yuen . " Before a signal could be given by the flagship , bugles throughout the fleet sounded the " officer 's call ' and , action . " Columns of dense smoke immediately began to shoot upwards from our funnels and must have signaled our presence to the enemy , for their smoke now increased in volume and height . " In fact , the Japanese did not notice the Chinese until 11 : 15 , at which point flags signaling " enemy spotted " shot up Matsushima 's mast , followed by the imperial standard , a gold chrysan , themum on a red field . Admiral Ting ordered his fleet to weigh anchor . Several of the ships were slow at getting underway , however , and as the Chinese formation tried to steam out in a line abreast to meet the enemy , it took on more of a wedge shape . Ting 's two torpedo boats remained in the Yalu River and did not venture out until the fight was nearly over . Admiral Ito 's squadrons were now between Ting 's warships and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emulating British practice , formed a single line as they approached the Chinese front . A large bright-yellow ensign was suddenly hoisted up Ting-Yuen 's mast , and the other ships of Ting 's fleet followed suit . The Japanese promptly raised their own battle flags . Both naval forces made a striking appearance , with their brilliant paint , colorful bunting and fluttering signal flags . The sight presented such a holiday atmosphere that it was hard to believe they were not there for a friendly fleet review , rather than a battle . Aboard Chen-Yuen , the Chinese crew , men , with queues coiled tightly around their heads , clustered in groups at their guns . Sand was sprinkled on the decks in case they became wet and slippery . Commander McGiffin related : " Here and there a man lay flat on the deck , with a charge of powder50 pounds or more-in his arms , waiting to spring up and pass it on when required . These men were stationed at intervals in order to serve the guns quickly . Charges were not stacked along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another Japanese painting shows gunners in action during the battle , which Western naval experts studied with great interest as a test of fast warships with quick-firing guns against heavily armored and arned vessels . // The two fleets rapidly approached each other . As each range was called , the men at the guns Would lower their sight bars . The air was heavy with tension , which was abruptly broken at 12:45 , when Ting-Yuen opened the action at 6,000 yards . Her first shell threw up a large column of water short of Yoshino . Neither Ting nor Ting-Yuen 's British executive officer , William E Tyler , had ordered the premature long shotCaptain Liu Pu-chan had fired it on his own , the concussion knocking both of his surprised senior officers off their feet . An unconscious Admiral Ting was carried to his bunk while Liu took charge of the action-and immediately panicked . With nobody directing it , the entire Chinese fleet commenced firing , but the distance was too great . With calm confidence , the Japanese squadrons held their fire . The Chinese shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate shooting increasingly difficult . The gunners did not score a single hit on the approaching Japanese . About five minutes passed before Ito finally ordered his ships to open fire . As soon as the Japanese squadrons commenced their attack , Captain Fang Paich'ien , commander of the 2,355-ton Tsi-Yuen , bolted the scene of action and steamed off at full speed to Port Arthur . He arrived there about 2 p.m. and spread a wild tale that the Chinese fleet had been overwhelmed by a vast Japanese armada . Upon examining his ship , however , it was discovered that the only enemy shell that hit Tsi-Yuen had struck her in the stern as she retreated . Captain Fang paid for his cowardice with his head . The commanding officer of Kwan-Chi , noticing Fang deserting his position , also turned tail and fled . However , his ship struck a reef and was destroyed . Meanwhile , Admiral Ito 's squadrons continued their rapid-fire barrage . The Japanese ships were almost twice as fast as their enemies , and their funnel and gun smoke helped screen their ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 feet above the water , was soon soaked by spray thrown up by the Japanese shells . " The men at the guns on deck were wet through as the water was flung on board with such force that it stung the face and hands like hail , " recalled McGiffin . " Everyone in the tower had his ears stuffed with cotton , yet the din made by the projectiles striking the armor was frightening . " Using their rapid-firing guns to the best advantage , the Japanese column raced steadily across the Chinese front , from left to right , until the leading Flying Squadron was able to swing around the starboard flank of the Chinese fleet . Admiral Tsuboi 's fast unarmored cruisers were soon abreast of Chao-Yung and Yang-Wei . The two older Chinese vessels were doomed from the start , as Japanese gunners blasted them with a withering barrage . Their partitions and bulkheads were made of highly varnished wood , which turned the ships ' passageways into alleys of roaring flames . The Flying Squadron then reversed course and went to the assistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered by Chinese shellfire. // Right : Count Li Hung-chang , minister of war and admiral-in-chief of the Imperial Chinese Navy .

The last Japanese ship in column , Hiei , found herself dead ahead of Ting@Yuen . She was the slowest ship in Ito 's squadron , and her captain , realizing that he could not keep up with the rest of the column , decided to take a shortcut between two enemy battleships and rejoin his squadron on the other side . As Hiei passed between the two ironclads , she was pummeled at point-blank range . Fortunately for the Japanese cruiser , several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to escape without any major damage . The Chinese formation was now broken into an irregular group . The Principal Squadron had steamed behind Ting 's ships , while the Flying Squadron swung around the front , surrounding the Chinese . Admiral Ito now concentrated his efforts on the most powerful of the Chinese warships . The Japanese hurled a storm of shells at Chen-Yuen and Ting-Yuen , but those vessels ' heavy armor continued to absorb the shock of the smallcaliber Japanese projectiles . Topside fires repeatedly broke out aboard the battlewagons , but they were quickly brought under control . Amid the confi-ision of battle , the cruiser Chih-Yuen boldly bore down on the Flying Squadron 's line in an attempt to finish off the floundering Akagi . The Chinese vessel immediately came under vicious shellfire and was struck below the waterline . Her captain , Tang Shi-chang , despite the mortal wound to his ship , plowed toward one of the Japanese cruisers with the intent of ramming the warship . A hurricane of projectiles swept Chih-Yuen , and she rolled over and sank bow first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who could not swim , managed to grab hold of a small board for support . The captain had a large dog aboard the ship , and the animal swam to its master , climbing onto Tang 's shoulders and forcing him to release his grip on the plank-perhaps the only case on record of a man being drowned by his dog . The Principal Squadron continued to engage the Chinese battleships . Matsushima ventured too close to Chen-Yuen , and Ito 's flagship immediately suffered a 12-inch shell hit near her 12.6-inch Canet gun mount . Powder charges for the gun had been stacked on the deck , and the resulting explosion destroyed most of the superstructure , crippling her steering gear and killing and wounding more than 100 men . Only heroic efforts by her crew saved Matsushima from complete destruction . As she turned away , Ito transferred his flag to Hashidate . Minutes later , the Principal Squadron withdrew toward the southeast , seemingly having had enough of the fight . The Chinese battleships pursued the withdrawing Japanese for about three miles , but then Ito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese battleships and poured on the most destructive fire of the day . After a half-hour of trading salvos , Ito again recalled both his squadrons , and the Japanese fleet withdrew from the conflict .

Above : A photograph of the Battle of the Yalu River , taken from the converted merchant ship Saiko Maru. // Unknown to Ito , Chen-Yuen had only three shells left . Had the Japanese admiral pressed his attack for a few minutes longer , all the Chinese ships would have been out of ammunition and completely defenseless . After the Japanese withdrew , the Chinese battleships turned back and , gathering up the surviving ships of their fleet , set a course for Port Arthur . Ito kept Ting 's fleet in sight until dark , but the Japanese made no effort to renew the attack . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , that an admiral , facing an enemy force ripe for destruction , discontinued the battle . One of the reasons for Ito 's decision to give up the chase was the arrival of the two Chinese torpedo boats . With darkness approaching , he felt that it would be prudent to wait until morning before completing his destruction of the Chinese fleet . But during the night Admiral Ting sneaked his ships back to Port Arthur , 60 miles to the north . Even if they did miss their opportunity to destroy the Peiyang Fleet , the Japanese had won a considerable strategic victory , gaining control of the disputed sea area . " The Japanese won because they had better ships , larger supplies of ammunition , and better officers and men , " wrote McGiffin . " The Japanese stood at their guns throughoutbut their decks were not being continually swept by a barrage of projectiles as were the Chinese . It is safe to say that the damage done to the Japanese vessels far exceeded their statements of it . They patched up their ships as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding exhibitions to foreigners of any serious damage . The Chinese , on the other hand , allowed many visitors to examine their ships while at Port Arthur undergoing repairs . " It is hard to believe that Admiral Ito Would allow two torpedo boats to frighten him , " McGiffin continued . " The Japanese said they thought the retreating Chinese fleet was headed for Wei-Hai-Wei , and that they intended to renew the battle in the morning . But why should we steam to WeiHai-Wei , which is over eighty miles farther than Port Arthur and has no repair facilities ? Moreover , the course we steered-direct for Port Arthur , even before dark-should have indicated to the Japanese the direction of the Chinese fleet . " Photograph Above : Riddled by a deluge of Japanese shells , Chih-Yuen rolls over . The Chinese lost five ships , while the Japanese lost none . Left : Commander Philo N McGiffin , an Amencan in Chinese service , was wounded in the battle , and his uniform was torn from fron the concussion of the gum . // Although Ito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass up the opportunity for a more crushing victory , he and the Japanese navy had generally performed creditably and consistently , which was more than could be said for his adversaries . Chinese marksmanship was so poor that even when Ito 's cruisers crossed in front of the Chinese fleet , very little damage was done to the Japanese vessels . After the battle , it was calculated that the Chinese ships only fired 33 rounds in a 10-minute period , compared to 185 Japanese rounds . Had the Chinese advance been able to break through the Japanese column , they could have dashed through and around Ito 's formation . As it was , however , the Chinese line became disorganized , and Admiral Ting issued no tactical orders . During the five-hour engagement , five Chinese ships were sent to the bottom of the Yellow Sea , and about 620 men were killed or wounded . The Japanese lost no ships and reported only 294 casualties . The principal strategic consequence of the battle was that the Japanese were able to carry the war to Chinese soil with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Foochow Fleet would reinforce Ting , but it never went to sea . When a Japanese army laid siege to Port Arthur , Ting did not oppose it , retiring instead to Weihaiwei in mid-November . After Port Arthur 's fall , the Japanese fleet blockaded Weihaiwei . Admiral Ito again demonstrated his belief in the potential of torpedos by launching a series of nocturnal attacks with his own torpedo boatsone of which , fired by torpedo boat No. 23 on February 6,1895 , sank Ting-Yuen , ChenYuen was sunk three days later by a shore battery that Japanese troops had captured from the Chinese . With Weihaiwei completely invested , Ito-who had been a good friend of Ting 's before the war-offered generous surrender terms . Ting capitulated on February 12 and then swallowed an overdose of opium . Ito seized all remaining ships of the northern fleet but one , which was tasked with carrying Admiral Ting 's body home . The Sino-Japanese War ended on April 17 , 1895 , with a defeated and humiliated China forced to cede Taiwan , the Liaotung Peninsula and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , France , Germany and Russia demanded that Japan return Liaotung to China . The Japanese reluctantly acceded on April 29 . Soon afterward , the Russians pressured Peking into " leasing " Port Arthur to them , the French occupied the Bay of Kwangchow , Germany seized Kiachow Bay , and Britain took over Weihaiwei . The Japanese , meanwhile , began work on a new , more modem and powerful navy . The Battle of the Yalu River was studied with great interest by naval experts around the world . The supporters of fast , rapid-firing ships claimed that their views had been justified by the Japanese victory . They insisted that too much weight was being put into armor and that it would be better allocated to guns . Their opponents argued that the test had not been a fair one , in view of Ting 's faulty tactics and the incompetence of the Chinese gunners . Although Ito 's cruisers had been circling Ting 's battleships and firing continuously , they failed to inflict vital damage-their deep , est penetration into the armor was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the Yalu River had not been a perfect battle and that tactical mistakes were made on both sides . Ito , in his approach across the Chinese bows , had expected Ting to turn his ships to port , which would have put the two fleets in parallel lines facing opposite directions . However , it is believed that the Chinese line was so ragged that there was not enough time for Ito to accurately gauge the situation and change course . As for tactics , the line-ahead seemed to be the better fighting formation . Only a few die-hards , noting the faulty disposition of the Chinese line-abreast formation-with the battleships in the center instead of on the wings-were of the opposite opinion . While the naval pundits were fuming at each other , the weapons on which they based their views were rapidly being improved . Ten years after the Battle of the Yalu River , the big naval gun had become a weapon of such precision and destructive power that a ship mounting the smaller quick-firing guns would have been hopelessly outclassed .
