<p> The family of slain teenager Paul Childs will receive $ 1.325 million under a proposed settlement from the city of Denver - the largest payout for a police shooting in city history . <p> The settlement comes less than 11 months after the 15-year-old developmentally disabled boy was shot to death and before the Childs family even filed a planned federal civil rights suit against the city . The amount is far less than the $ 5 million minimum the family proposed in January . <p> On Tuesday , family representatives and city officials said they were pleased with the settlement , which still must be approved by the City Council in coming weeks . <p> ' They are happy , ' said attorney Timothy Rastello , speaking on behalf of the Childs family in front of the North Park Hill home in northeast Denver where the shooting occurred . <p> But Rastello , who represented the family along with famed attorney Johnnie Cochran , added , ' Seeing your child killed in front of you is immeasurable in damage . ' <p> City Attorney Cole Finegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about costs if the case went to trial , the city 's potential liability and demands on city staff . <p> The settlement , Finegan said , is ' fair and in the interest of all parties involved . This will allow us to move forward . ' <p> Under the terms of the agreement , Finegan said , the city admits no wrongdoing . And the Childs family - mother Helen and sister Ashley - agreed to release the city , city officials and police , including officer James Turney who fired the fatal shots , from further liability . <p> The Rev. Paul Martin of Macedonia Baptist Church , where Paul Childs ' mother is a member , said the family just wants ' to get on with their life . ' <p> He said the family was pleased with the settlement , but many in the community had hoped the city would have to pay even more . <p> ' I wish it was $ 30 million , myself , ' Martin said . <p> Mayor John Hickenlooper met with council members behind closed doors Tuesday but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staff , Michael Bennet , said the mayor believes the settlement is reasonable , given the circumstances . <p> The settlement requires City Council approval . The council will hear the bill Tuesday and take a final vote June 7 . <p> Only one of the 13 council members - Jeanne Faatz - opposes the settlement . She has previously objected to settlements in which people were hurt after police confronted them for wrongdoing . <p> Paul Childs was shot to death July 5 by officer Turney after the boy 's family called police to their home at 5550 E. Thrill Place when the teen began wielding a kitchen knife with an 8 1/2-inch blade . <p> After officers arrived and cleared everyone else from the home , Childs walked out from behind a door holding the knife and did n't drop it , despite officers ' orders . Although two officers on the scene had nonlethal Taser stun weapons , Turney fired his gun when Childs approached him , according to an investigation by the Denver district attorney 's office . <p> Turney has been suspended without pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal of that discipline . <p> Turney and another officer still face a lawsuit in the January 2002 fatal shooting of Gregory Smith , 18 , a hearing-impaired man who pulled a knife on them on the staircase of his mother 's northeast Denver home . That case is scheduled for trial this year . <p> The settlement announcement comes as Hickenlooper is considering proposed reforms sparked by the Childs shooting . <p> Rastello suggested those proposed changes to the use-of- <p> force policy and police discipline likely saved the city money in the settlement . He said that ' because the mayor and city attorney have been willing to make those policy changes , the family was willing to take a lot less . ' <p> The Denver police union , which has been critical of some of the proposed reforms , said in a news release that it was not included in any negotiations between the city and the Childs family . <p> ' Officer James Turney acted appropriately and we fully support him , ' said the release from the Denver Police Protective Association . ' We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the facts would have been known . ' <p> Legal observers said they were surprised by how quickly the city settled . It 's a marked change from the past , said lawyer David Lane . <p> ' I applaud the city of Denver for understanding its liability early , fessing up and getting out more cheaply than it would have ' if it had gone to trial , Lane said . ' They saved the taxpayers a lot of money by doing that . ' <p> Craig Silverman , a former prosecutor who now handles civil and criminal cases , said the settlement benefits both sides : The Childs family will not have to answer difficult questions at trial , and the city will avoid a public-relations nightmare . <p> ' Even if Denver was to win the trial , nobody is proud of what happened at the Childs house that day , ' Silverman said . <p> Penfield Tate III , a former state senator and co-chairman of Hickenlooper 's police reform task force , said , ' That the city paid something to the Childs family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of problem . ' <p> Cochran was not available for comment Tuesday . He was recently released from the hospital , where , according to his office , he was being treated for a ' neurological condition . ' <p> ' Johnnie was very much here in spirit and whenever we needed him by telephone , ' Rastello said . ' He obviously played an important role . ' <p> Rastello said he could not comment on attorney fees . Generally a settlement that comes before a suit is filed is split with one-third going to attorneys and two-thirds to the plaintiff , according to several local attorneys . <p> Negotiations between the city and the Childses ' attorneys began in January , when the family filed a notice that it intended to sue for more than $ 5 million . The case was put before a mediator this month . Rastello said an agreement was reached last week and the settlement was signed Tuesday . <p> The $ 1.325 million figure would be the highest amount the city has paid out for a police shooting and the second-highest payout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city paid $ 3.5 million in the case of Randy Bartel , who was killed in 1989 when an officer ran a red light while responding to a nonemergency call . Rastello also represented the family in that case , which was in the courts for more than a decade . <p> ' This is a new day , ' Rastello said . ' This is a new administration , and these guys are being courageous and much bolder than I have seen in my entire career here in Denver . <p> ' It 's no longer business as usual .
