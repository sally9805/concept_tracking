<p> Marcus Hahnemann and Bobby Convey have absolutely nothing in common . <p> Hahnemann is 33 years old , 6 feet 2 and 220 pounds , married with two kids , a Seattle native who nearly joined the Marines after high school , has a shaved head and stubby goatee , chews tobacco , rocks to hardcore punk , drinks whiskey , collects guns , rebuilds old Porsches and rides mountain bikes in British Columbia . <p> Convey is 22 , 5-8 and 150 pounds , single , soft-spoken , raised in northeast Philadelphia , an honor roll student at an expensive Quaker school , turned pro at age 16 , lived in a quiet suburb in Northern Virginia while playing for D.C. United , sleeps a lot and likes to golf . <p> But over the last eight months , in a small city 40 miles west of London , their diverse worlds have meshed to help facilitate one of the grandest accomplishments in British soccer this year . <p> With Hahnemann in goal and Convey patrolling the left wing , Reading has run away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in its 135-year history . <p> And you thought Red Sox and White Sox fans had waited a while for something good to happen . <p> " It 's been an incredible thrill , " said Hahnemann , a journeyman goalkeeper who , in his fourth full season with the Royals ( 29-2-11 ) , has almost as many shutouts ( 22 ) as goals allowed ( 28 ) . To play in the Premier League , " it 's a place I 've been trying to get for a long time . " <p> While the other Reading players will go their separate ways when the season ends in three weeks , Hahnemann and Convey are likely to spend much of the summer together as members of the U.S. World Cup team . <p> Barring injury , both are expected to be named to the 23-man roster early next month and journey to Germany in June for the sport 's quadrennial championship . Hahnemann seems set to join Manchester United 's Tim Howard as the backups to veteran starter Kasey Keller , while Convey has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another U.S. World Cup player , midfielder-defender Eddie Lewis , remains in contention with his club , Leeds , to move into the Premier League , but a playoff victory would be needed . <p> In England and most other leagues around the world , a promotion and relegation system is in place : The top teams in lower divisions move up one level the following season , while the bottom clubs take a step down . <p> The number of Americans competing in the Premier League , considered one of the wealthiest and most competitive in the world , has been swelling recently . Howard , Claudio Reyna ( Manchester City ) , Carlos Bocanegra and Brian McBride ( Fulham ) , Brad Friedel ( Blackburn ) and Jonathan Spector ( Charlton ) are currently with clubs in the top division . <p> And now Hahnemann and Convey  --  and possibly Lewis  --  are on their way up . <p> " To earn the respect of the English media and the English players is so important , " said Convey , who played for D.C. United for 41/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not that they do n't want you to succeed , but there 's always a little animosity toward an American player because English soccer has been around so long and they do n't expect an American to come in and do well . " <p> While Convey has n't had to wait long to get to the Premier League , Hahnemann took a circuitous path . After anchoring Seattle Pacific University 's run to the Division II national championship in 1993 , he played professionally for the minor league Seattle Sounders for three seasons . <p> A year after MLS 's 1996 launch , Hahnemann joined the Colorado Rapids . In his first season , he helped the mediocre club make an unexpected playoff run to the championship game at RFK Stadium , where it lost to United , 2-1 . <p> Through a connection overseas , Hahnemann began training in England during the offseason and soon attracted the interest of Fulham , which in the summer of ' 99 bought him for a mere $90,000 . <p> He was buried on the bench , however , and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain playing time and exposure . Reading liked what it saw and acquired him for good before the 2002 season . <p> With Hahnemann starting , the Royals flirted with promotion the next three years before deciding to restructure their roster last summer . <p> Hahnemann was on U.S. national team duty at the Gold Cup in July when he decided to check in with Convey , who had already rejoined Reading for preseason training . <p> " I asked him how it was going there , and he said , ' We only have 12 guys , ' " Hahnemann recalled . " I was like , ' Oh , man , this is going to be a long year . ' " <p> After adding several new players , the Royals lost their opener at home to an average Plymouth side , 2-1 . Three days later , they defeated Brighton , 2-0 , triggering a 33-game unbeaten streak ( 25-0-8 ) that lasted more than six months . They did n't lose again until Feb. 17 to Luton , but picked up where they left off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-1 tie at Leicester that clinched promotion . <p> Hahnemann has become a fan favorite , tossing his jersey into the crowd after each home match . When the club grew tired of giving him new shirts , he started buying his own in order to continue his goodwill gestures . <p> Reading supporters also have grown accustomed to seeing Hahnemann buzzing around the Berkshire town in a Porsche that he upgraded in his garage with a turbo engine and new parts as well as old ones salvaged from a previous sports car that he owned . ( He also has two Jeep Cherokees . ) <p> Every few months , he takes the Porsche to Donington Park in the Midlands , where he spins around the Grand Prix circuit at up to 135 mph . <p> Asked if he wanted to pursue a racing career when he 's done with soccer , Hahnemann said : " I want to race cars now . It 's just too expensive . " <p> As for the danger involved , he added : " It 's way more dangerous on the road than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything is going in the same direction . You can be doing 135 and you do n't have any problems to worry about . " <p> He then paused , thought about what he had just said , and added , " Well , except for the walls . " <p> Said Arena : " He 's a very entertaining guy . He 's a good goalkeeper , he 's got a personality and he understands where he fits in with our group . " <p> Until last fall , Convey wondered if he would ever make it in England . <p> In 2003 , his transfer from MLS to the Premier League 's Tottenham Hotspur was voided because he could n't get a British work permit , and he returned to United . <p> But his national team appearances continued to grow , rekindling interest overseas and making it easier for him to acquire a work permit . ( Non-European players need to be regular members of their national team in order to earn a living in England . ) <p> Just before the start of the 2004-05 season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't really know anyone 's name for the first five games , " Convey said . He appeared in only 22 of 46 matches , started just seven and did n't register a goal or an assist . <p> Last summer , desperate to make an impression on Coach Steve Coppell , he and Arena agreed that it would be in his best interests to return to England instead of playing for the U.S. team in the Gold Cup , an inconsequential regional tournament . <p> " If I was n't going to get a chance to play , I did n't want to be there anymore , " Convey said . " The coach made it really clear that he wanted me to play and be a big part of the team , and it 's worked out . " <p> Hahnemann said he told Convey that , in order to survive , " you 've just got to work your butt off and do the stuff you do n't want to do , the stupid stuff like sliding for a ball that 's going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to look like you 're trying because , especially in England , that 's what they 're looking for . " <p> Convey made his mark in the preseason and has played in every league match , mostly on the left wing but some in central midfield . He is tied for second on the team in assists with 11 and sixth in goals with seven  --  one fewer than he scored in 89 MLS appearances . <p> " Bobby 's been a slow burn , " Coppell told the Associated Press recently . " He sort of struggled with our mentality a bit and , in the summer , he sat himself down and put to himself the target of being a regular player , and he 's done that . He 's got a brightness and a pace . " <p> Arena has monitored Convey 's progress closely , saying : " One of the biggest obstacles Bobby has is just growing up and realizing that , in terms of soccer , there are other people in the universe besides Bobby . <p> " He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a team player . Going through a whole season at that level , it 's been a fantastic exercise for Bobby . "
