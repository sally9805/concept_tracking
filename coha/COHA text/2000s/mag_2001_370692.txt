Moby is a 5-ft. 8-in. , ghostly white , completely bald , born-again Christian , vegan rock star . Born Richard Melville Hall , he is the **29;13403;TOOLONG of Herman Melville ( thus the name ) . He shuns drugs and alcohol and devours soy milk . His singing voice is just decent , and his biggest success to date has been an album anchored by samples from Alan Lomax field recordings . It 's safe to say that it required a certain amount of gumption for Moby to will himself into the rock-star pantheon . Even Joe Cocker had it easier . <P> Not content with his own unlikely act of self-creation , Moby has applied himself to reimagining the summer concert tour . Area : One , his dazzling , multigenre , multiact music festival , took to the road in Atlanta last week with the laudable goal of attracting not just a core demo of Bic-flicking heavy-metal geezers or profoundly dilated techno kids but everyone : teens , adults , blacks , whites  --  just plain music fans , in the old-timey sense . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gender friendly and features some of the top acts in hip-hop , pop , rock and dance music . Many industry veterans believe it will be the very definition of a noble failure . " Idealistically , it 's a great concept , " says Gary Bongiovanni , editor in chief of tour industry bible Pollstar . " Whether it 's financially practical is another matter . " <P> Ever since Lollapalooza capsized under the weight of its own mismanagement in 1997 , the summer concert season has been dominated by increasingly narrow niche tours . Ozzfest , Warped , Lilith Fair , Guinness Fleadh , Smokin ' Grooves and others have all mined a slim vein of music with varying degrees of financial success . While only Ozzfest and Warped are back this year , the concert industry trusts results over ideology ; Moby and the multigenre festival tour both have to prove themselves viable . " The whole tour is an experiment , " says Moby . " We 've put this eclectic bill together , and I guess we 'll see if people are receptive to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out why multigenre tours disappeared before doing one of my own , " he says , flashing a coy smile . " Oh , well . " <P> Do n't let the artiste-savant act fool you . Moby is extremely shrewd when it comes to the pursuit of profit . After his 1999 album , Play , stalled on the charts because it could n't break through niche-driven radio playlists , Moby and longtime managers Marci Weber and Barry Taylor devised a remarkable strategy in which all 18 album cuts were licensed for commercial use . Songs from Play showed up in ads for Nordstrom and Nissan , in an Oliver Stone movie and  --  egad !  --  on Veronica 's Closet before finally muscling their way onto radio in between Limp Bizkit and Britney Spears . <P> Play has since gone platinum in 26 countries , and its success proves two things . First , Moby is an astute businessman willing to make commercial concessions to get his music heard . Second , the average listener has an appetite for vastly different styles of music  --  from Britney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's edgy rock and techno  --  if only someone would serve them . " It 's a classic commercial approach , " says Moby . " You look at a cultural scenario and see a strange void . All of my friends ' record collections are very eclectic . Then you look at all the festivals , and ... they 're not bad , they 're just one-dimensional . "
