<p> He 's all alone in a cinder-block basement , a prisoner to the phones that wo n't stop ringing . <p> In " Fully Committed , " a solo tour de force at the Cherry Lane Theatre , a restaurant reservationist 's battle to stay on top of an impossible job is the inviting premise . Playwright Becky Mode and a deceptively brilliant actor named Mark Setlock make the most of it , in a hilarious and trenchant show that no one who 's ever dined out or held a job should miss . It 's the single most gratifying find in the current off-Broadway crop of shows . <p> The show is also coming to restaurant-mad San Francisco . Performances begin June 8 at Theatre on the Square , with an actor yet to be cast . Setlock is heading west to be " Fully Committed " in Los Angeles . <p> In addition to his own harried character , the performer plays an entire city  --  heck , a whole country  --  that 's desperate to get a table at the hotter-than-hot Manhattan " global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood in from uppity Upper East Side society mavens , Milwaukee rubes and a supermodel 's chirpy assistant , Setlock smoothly handles both ends of the conversations . <p> The dialogue du jour is impeccably served . Naomi Campbell wants an all-vegan tasting menu , no dairy , softer lighting in the sconces . " And no female wait staff ! " A woman pleading for a table irrationally wheedles , " We are two teeny , tiny people . " An inconsolable senior complains that her lamb was " bitter cold " the night before ; on the toilet seat she encountered " a puddle of urine . " <p> Meanwhile , in the siege state of the restaurant itself , crises flame up like saute pans . The chef , who has his own private hot line to the basement , throws one snit after another . A thrillingly petty maitre d ' refuses to speak to a regular customer because he ca n't stand her looks . The Zagats , of the influential guidebook , arrive for lunch without a reservation . There 's a mess in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Director Nicholas Martin times the chaos for maximum effect . <p> Somehow , in this justice-blind world , the guy who 's already swamped with the phones is expected to put out the rest of the fires . Perversity reigns supreme , but the beleaguered hero 's ability to hold his own and even exhibit a certain grace and generosity of spirit is wonderful to watch . <p> Setlock is a Midwestern Everyguy , a struggling actor sucked into the dramatic lunacy of a chic New York restaurant . Show business , after this kind of spotlit high pressure , ought to be a snap . When Lincoln Center bigwig Bernard Gersten comes in to eat  --  the script is full of real-name titillation  --  the nobody in the basement gets his improbable break . <p> " Fully Committed " does n't try to reach too far . It 's too busy keeping up with the frantic demands of the moment . But you come away heightened to the climate of the times , the buzz , money , ferocious appetites for whatever 's hot and an occasional glimmer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much funnier than any on TV and freed from a laugh-tracked half-hour structure . That 's " The Tale of the Allergist 's Wife , " Charles Busch 's very entertaining new comedy at the Manhattan Theatre Club . <p> Linda Lavin plays the neurotic heroine Marjorie , a classic New York culture-vulture of the sort who attends shows at this very theater . After a steady diet of 92nd Street Y lectures , grueling Greek tragedies at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and West Side wine tastings , Marjorie is burned out on her own mediocrity . Her Thomas Pynchon-influenced novel has n't worked , and she 's just acted out her frustration by smashing figurines at the Disney Store . <p> Enter her old childhood friend Lee ( a breezy , unsatisfactory performance by Michele Lee ) , who 's lived everywhere and met Rainer Fassbinder , Lenny Bruce and Henry Kissinger while Marjorie sat still . No sooner has she inspired Marjorie with her whirlwind energy and exotic cooking than Lee sets about tempting her and her allergist husband Ira ( the ideal Tony Roberts ) into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wrote " The Lady in Question " and " Vampire Lesbians in Sodom , " sends up cautious middle-class liberals and their cultural furniture with a flurry of great lines . Lavin plays her role perfectly , with a desultory air , dead-on timing and spasms of pure rage . Roberts excels as a good-natured egomaniac . <p> If this " Tale " finally banishes the outsider in a routine , feel-good way , the script and Lynne Meadow 's well-staged production pleases from beginning to end . It 's a quintessential New York theater experience  --  bound for Broadway in the fall  --  smoothly written and mounted , serenely self-referential , with stars in the cast . Manhattan is the world to Marjorie . Even when it defeats her , she 'd never dream of being anywhere else . <p> Marriage is the main course in " Dinner With Friends , " freshly crowned with the Pulitzer Prize . Donald Margulies ' play at the Variety Arts Theatre is a chamber piece , scored for two couples and handsomely produced , about one marriage coming apart and another clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutary thing for the dueling duo of Beth ( Carolyn McCormick ) and Tom ( Kevin Kilner , who has since left the cast ) . Not only do they both wind up in happier marriages , but they even get to shuck bad careers , lose weight , tell people off , reveal secrets and have great sex  --  with each other  --  along the way . <p> Gabe ( Matthew Arkin ) and Karen ( Lisa Emery ) are the couple left holding the leaky bag of what 's supposed to be a good marriage . In Margulies ' rather mechanical ironies , Gabe and Karen 's great Italian food and wine become the emotional equivalent of bread and water . Well fed as they are , these two look shifty and starved for most of the night . <p> " Dinner " unspools with surprising grandeur under Daniel Sullivan 's direction . Each of the seven scenes takes place in a different location , and the action hops around over a 13-year period . But it all adds up to less than the sum of its well-oiled parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , and Margulies ' " Dinner " Pulitzer may be a case of rewarding past work . " Collected Stories " and " Sight Unseen , " both produced by Berkeley Repertory Theatre , are stronger , more substantial works . <p> " Dinner " entertains in a teasing , transitory way . Margulies displays a keenly tuned eye and ear for the subtle mendacities and submerged malaise of marriage . And he 's well served by the actors and designers ; the production has the eerie sheen of a Bon Appetit magazine spread come to life . " Dinner " gets all the surface details right . And that 's the trouble ; what 's hinted at below in these schematic characters does n't deliver much of a depth charge . <p> The hyped and heavily advertised " Fuddy Meers " has just posted its closing notice at the Minetta Lane Theatre . David Lindsay-Abaire 's contorted comedy , about a benignly dazed woman whose memory goes blank every morning ( J. Smith-Cameron as Claire ) , wo n't be sorely missed . <p> The play takes a carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to Claire , another who talks to a puppet and a hostile teenage son who may be the healthiest character onstage . The playwright substitutes dysfunction and disability for substantive comic events  --  the title is a speech-impaired character 's way of pronouncing " Funny Mirrors . " <p> It 's a shame the play squanders so much of its capital on quirkiness , because the ending has a touching , tilted kind of lyricism . As Claire and her makeshift family drive home in a **27;275;TOOLONG car , the woman who can barely remember anything longs to have the whole crazy-quilt story of her life flung over her again and again . <p> It 's a stretch to call " De la Guarda " theater . High-impact bungee jumping crossed with a very damp night in a mosh pit is a closer accounting of this phenomenally popular attraction at the Daryl Roth Theatre . For anyone weary of plays about people having dinner , here 's a tonic return to the brutely physical roots of live performance . <p> Premiered in Argentina in the mid-1980s , " De la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Thundering minimalist music , piercing lights and a drenching mist are all part of this resolutely unlovely aerial act . Call it the anti-Cirque du Soleil . <p> Packed together on a flat floor like Times Square revelers on New Year 's Eve , the spectators gaze up at shadows of figures darting across a paper ceiling . Soon the figures break through , tearing the ceiling apart as they descend . Rigged up on springy cords strung around the house , the performers fling themselves through the air in aggressively angular configurations . <p> Sometimes they fly solo and sometimes in clumps , and sometimes they pluck audience members off the floor . Wherever they go , they do it with bent knees , butts and elbows leading like knife points . Starkly ravishing images crop up from time to time  --  a stream of water pounding down on a backlit performer 's head ; a pair of rock climbers scaling a giant tram poline wall and falling , over and over , into its springy depths . <p> Yet , for all its energy and daring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much rhythm or shapeliness to it . And peril to anyone who tries to interpret " De la Guarda . " Go for the ride , get wet  --  and if you 're in your 20s , go back again . Repeat business is very big . <p> Any theatergoing trip to New York requires hard choices .
