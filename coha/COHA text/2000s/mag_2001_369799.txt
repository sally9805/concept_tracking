The Incredible Shrinking Ex-President <P> " Perhaps now we can all stop pretending that so-called private morality does not affect a person 's public behavior . " BOB SMALLMAN Merrill , Wis . <P> The pardons Bill Clinton issued that are being questioned look suspiciously as if they were influenced by money NATION , Feb. 26 . And while I may be disgusted with the pardons , I am not surprised . Until we clean up our system , why not put applicants for pardons in the same category as other favor seekers in government , the one that includes people who make big donations to become an ambassador ? That way we would not be hypocrites . We would just be recognizing it is politics as usual . STEWART PERRY Wayzata , Minn . <P> The incredible thing is that while the Republicans do n't have Bill Clinton to kick around anymore , that does n't stop them from doing it . Clinton may be remembered as the President who was never once given a break . KEVIN DAWSON Sunland , Calif . <P> Why is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to pardon , which is so obviously open to abuse ? Clinton 's pardons may have been the worst , but they were hardly the first to be controversial . The power to pardon assumes that due process will fail and that Presidents and Governors will have the wisdom and good conscience to remedy its failures . The sad truth is that these officials are cut from the same cloth as the rest of us . BOB HILTON Iowa City <P> On balance , I am very satisfied with the judgment of former President Clinton in granting a pardon to fugitive billionaire Marc Rich . This controversy demonstrates that the person who holds the office of President is one of the few people who are n't caught up in legal and political minutiae and thus can see the bigger picture . The postelection hassles show how much the conservatives need Clinton as a whipping boy . Without him , they will have to accept responsibility for governing now that they have the White House , the Supreme Court , the Senate and the House of Representatives . LEON F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pain , but then he schmoozed with ultra-affluent Hollywood types , acquiesced to the whims of big donors , took things from the White House and retired to extravagant , upper-crust digs . Bill and Hillary Clinton are the American version of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos . LINDA A. BIELINSKI Bartlett , Ill . <P> In the interest of bipartisanship , should n't you give the Republicans equal time ? I do n't recall that you analyzed each of President Bush 's pardons in such excruciating detail . ANN C. EDMONDS Bloomington , Ind . <P> If there is a Presidency that has shrunk , it 's that of George W. Bush , whose best ideas are overshadowed by the worst of his predecessor . JAMES A. DITTES Westmoreland , Tenn . <P> I am not angry at Bill and Hillary . I have to admit that my feelings border on ambivalence and apathy . What does it matter now ? Those who once used Clinton when he was President are now through with him , and they are eating him alive . While I have no sympathy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOUIS WISLOCKI Rockford , Mich . <P> If the Republicans think they can win in 2002 and 2004 by hammering Clinton for the next four years , the Democrats have nothing to worry about .
