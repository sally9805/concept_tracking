It 's hard for me to think about ADMIRAL ELMO ( " BUD " ) ZUMWALT without thinking about fathers and sons who serve together in the military . Admiral Zumwalt was my father 's friend ; they served together during the Vietnam War . Zumwalt had attained the highest command in the U.S. Navy , Chief of Naval Operations . My father was commander-in-chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific . My father ordered warplanes to bomb Hanoi while I was a prisoner of war there . Admiral Zumwalt ordered the use of Agent Orange in combat areas where his son served . <P> The admiral came to see me some years ago to discuss veterans with diseases caused by Agent Orange and the need to fund research . At the time , his son was dying from cancer caused by Agent Orange . The admiral knew , as my father knew , that his decision had been necessary to save the lives of many other Americans . I told him how sorry I was about his son . He said simply , " I 'm proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some that might seem like a stinting remark , but military families recognize it as the most loving praise a father could give a son . Had he outlived his father , the admiral 's son would mourn his loss , as do I , by saying , " We 're proud of you , sir . You did your duty and earned your rest .
