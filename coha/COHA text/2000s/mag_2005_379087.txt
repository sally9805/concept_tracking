For the next decade , whenever there is a terrorist attack anywhere in the world , there will be those blaming it on America : if only America had not been distracted from the war on terrorism by the war in Iraq , if only America had not stirred Muslim resentment and increased al-Qaeda recruitment by invading Iraq . <P> Nonsense . The " distraction " argument is the most obvious nonsense . What exactly is the U.S. not doing in the war on terrorism that it would be doing if it were n't in Iraq ? We are supporting a fiercely antiterrorist democratic government in Afghanistan , hunting al-Qaeda in the impossible terrain on the Pakistani frontier , coordinating with just about every secret service in the world to disrupt terrorist communications , movement and funding . What is it about Iraq that " distracts " ? <P> As for the recruitment claim , when was the seminal period of al-Qaeda recruitment  --  indeed , the period during which it created its entire worldwide infrastructure ? The 1990s . No invasion of Iraq . No invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodating , apologetic U.S. foreign policy since World War II . In fact , the 1990s was the decade of Muslim rescue : the U.S. intervened militarily , and decisively , to save three Muslim peoples  --  the Bosnians , the Kosovars and the Kuwaitis  --  from conquest and catastrophe . Yet it was precisely during that era of good feeling that al-Qaeda not only recruited for but also conceived , planned and set in motion the worst massacre of Americans in history . So much for the connection between American perfidy and anti-American terrorism . <P> Al-Qaeda always invents some excuse , some historical injury to justify its barbarism . Today Iraq , yesterday Palestine and , when all else fails , Andalusia , a bin Laden staple that refers to the Muslim loss of Spain to Ferdinand and Isabella ( in 1492 ! ) . Various casus belli are served up as conditions change . Only the gullible and the appeasers buy them . Now we 're told that the Iraq invasion has increased al-Qaeda recruiting . <P> The first thing to be said is that no one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbered party-registration cards . But let 's assume , for the sake of argument , that there are Muslims energized by Iraq  --  who were not energized by Western colonialism , American imperialism , Hollywood decadence , the Roosevelt-Saud alliance , the Afghan war , Zionism , feminism or other alleged outrages against Islam . They were living contentedly , tending their shoe shop in Riyadh , and all of a sudden they discovered the joys of jihad and the lure of heavenly posthumous sex awaiting them at the other end of a suicide bombing . <P> The fact is that the war on terrorism is a very long war . It is not decided by a battle here or there . It would not have been won by stopping in Afghanistan and spending the rest of our lives going cave to cave looking for bin Laden and his henchmen . Kill him and shut the cave , yet jihadism would continue . <P> It would continue because it is a sickness incubated within Arab/ Islamic culture , a toxic combination of repression , corruption , intolerance and fanaticism , fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the American infidel . Until that political culture changes fundamentally , jihadism will thrive .
