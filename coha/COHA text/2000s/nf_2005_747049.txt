Creating a New Culture for Nurturing Graduate Nurses <p> Successful training and initiation of new graduate nurses is a critical concern for the entire healthcare industry . Current literature reports that as many as 80-90% of new graduate nurses will leave their job within the first year of employment ( Bradley , 2001 ) . <p> In summer 2001 , the inpatient orthopaedic department of a large community hospital in the southeastern United States was faced with significant recruitment and retention issues . In response , a new nurse graduate transition program was developed for the orthopaedic specialty . This program uses an adult learning model and a single dedicated preceptor . In addition to clinical experience , the program provides special attention to the development of professional behavior , relationship building , and critical-thinking skills . During the next 2 years , the program produced eight new orthopaedic nurses with a first-year turnover rate of 0% . In addition , this program has positively influenced other areas of importance for RN recruitment and retention , including quality of care , patient satisfaction , and staff satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional settings . One in seven Americans experience bone and joint problems , including fractures , arthritis , sports trauma , and osteoporosis , costing approximately $254 billion annually ( U.S. Bone and Joint Decade USBJD , 2003 ) . With the exponential growth of Americans over the age of 50 years expected to double within the next decade , the need within the orthopaedic specialty is felt more profoundly as the number of practicing nurses continue to decline ( USBJD , 2003 ) . The American Hospital Association reports that between 1990 and 2000 , the ratio of experienced nurses to new graduates decreased from 90:10 to 50:50 ( SEW News , 2003 ) . However , it is reported that upward of 80-90% of new graduate nurses leave their jobs within the first year of employment ( Bradley , 2001 ) . This painful disparity is a reality that warrants an immediate plan of action to improve the introduction of these valuable , yet vulnerable , new nurses into the profession . <p> The Orthopaedic Nurse Transition Program ( ONTP ) was launched as a pilot project in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a large Magnet community hospital in the southeastern United States . The majority of services provided by this unit arc dedicated to elective total joint replacement and spinal surgery . The ONTP was developed and adapted by the orthopaedic unit clinical coordinator in response to existing RN vacancies , high RN turnover , poor experienced RN recruitment potential , and lack of mentorship among the existing staff . The program was funded and supported by nursing administration , with assistance from the departments of human resources and nursing education under recruitment and retention initiatives that existed at that time . Objectives <p> The ONTP used a single dedicated preceptor to bridge the gap between structured clinical student assignments and real-world work experience . The use of one preceptor ensured that correct methods and techniques would be taught consistently . This preceptor also served as a professional role model , advocate , teammate , and cheerleader for the new graduates . <p> The preceptor was chosen from the orthopaedic nursing staff based on the criteria listed in Table 1 . This preceptor was not counted in workload productivity nor assigned any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to clinical orthopaedic training , the preceptor acted as a mentor to nurture and protect the new nurses from the unrealistic expectations of tenured nursing staff . Another equally important objective for the preceptor was to socially integrate the new nurses into the culture of the unit . Real-world working relationships differ significantly from the nursing school experience . Learning to work in a team-centered environment was not necessarily intuitive , but it was vital to the survival of the new nurse graduate on the orthopaedic unit . <p> The first three candidates for the ONTP were selected using the criteria listed in Table 1 . The characteristics of this group were all female , age 24 to 42 . Two graduated with a BSN degree and one with an ASM degree . A human resource consultant was used to recruit , interview , and screen all applicants . All the candidates were expected to take the state NCLEX-RN examination after or near the end of the 12-week duration . <p> Although the state board of nursing at the time still provided the graduate nurse designation , medication administration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital policy . <p> The ultimate goals for this pilot project were to : Establish and define a structured orientation program for new nurses that was flexible with the needs of the nursing unit and adaptable to the learning needs of any new nurse at time of hire . Reduce RN turnover rate and increase RN retention rate . Fill all open RN positions within 1 year . Improve staff morale and establish a culture of mentorship . Improve overall quality of nursing care . Methods <p> The conceptual model for the structure of this program was based on the needs of the adult learner . Andragogy and other models of adult learning see life experience as both a resource and a stimulus for learning ( Merriam &; Caffarella , 1999 ) . The concept of Andragogy is described by Knowles based on the following assumptions ( Merriam &; Caffarella , 1999 ) : The adult learner is self-directing . The adult learner uses an accumulation of experiences as a learning resource . The readiness to learn as an adult is closely related to the developmental tasks of his or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject-centered . The adult learner is motivated by internal factors rather than external ones . <p> Figure 1 depicts the sequence of the ONTP in detail . The curriculum included minimal classroom time , hands-on experience in six other alternative learning areas , customer service training , and individual patient care assignments . Each week focused on a particular goal . For example , week 4 focused on clinical processes , following the previous week 's goal of clinical interventions . The preceptor was responsible for planning the learning experiences for the transition nurses ( TNs ) each week , with the assistance of the clinical coordinator . The learning experiences were prioritized in a particular sequence that allowed hands-on experience at the same time the material was taught . For example , the TNs were scheduled to observe a total hip replacement surgery in the operating room the same week total hip precautions were taught . The program linked skills with concepts , such as programming a patient-controlled analgesia pump , with the more challenging concepts of pain management . The alternative learning experiences were 4-hour rotations through six different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the TNs spent time in one of the following areas : postanesthesia care unit , perioperative services , ambulatory surgery , preadmission testing , operating room , and rounds with the acute pain team . <p> The weekly objectives and goals are listed in Figure 1 . The TNs ' progress was tracked by the preceptor and clinical coordinator each week . The TNs were given an opportunity to provide feedback with a weekly evaluation form ( Figure 2 ) . <p> At week 5 , the program began to focus on interpersonal relationships such as teamwork and customer service . The TNs were invited to join the nursing care director on patient rounds , collecting comments from the patients regarding satisfaction and quality of nursing care . They were also put into the role of unit secretary , integrated case manager , and nursing care associate for a day to attain a deeper appreciation and sensitivity for the people who support the nursing staff . <p> The TNs were also challenged to identify areas for improvement , make a personal action plan , and establish their own code of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TNs were honored with a graduation ceremony that was attended by the chief nursing officer . This was an opportunity to celebrate the individual achievements of the TNs and to formally recognize them as new members of the nursing unit . Results <p> The ONTP was successful in many ways . The curriculum worked well with the learning needs of this new graduate group . The preceptor felt confident about their abilities - in both communication skills and clinical competence . Several physicians expressed enthusiasm for the TN program . One physician commented that he had always assumed the TNs were already experienced RNs . He was impressed with the level of maturity and professionalism in the group . Using the initial pilot program with some modifications , the author 's institution has since applied the program for the orientation of licensed practical nurses ( LPNs ) and experienced RNs alike . The orthopaedic nursing orientation " blue print " and dedicated preceptor is now used as a standard for all new orthopaedic nursing staff and influences the orientation of nurses in other specialized inpatient care areas . Currently , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cardiac specialty to the orthopaedic specialty . <p> The RN turnover rate in June 2001 was a dubious 22.6% . One full year after the implementation of this program , the rate dropped significantly to 7.7% . The retention of this original group was 100% for the first year . One nurse left for relocation after 1 year , another nurse stayed for 2.5 years before relocating . The remaining nurse is still currently working on the orthopaedic unit and was honored last year as a Nurse of Excellence by the hospital as part of its internal Nurses ' Week celebration . The relocated nurses have kept in touch with the author and described their orientation to the orthopaedic specialty through the transition program experience as the foundation for their successful nursing careers . The orthopaedic unit maintained a 0% RN turnover rate for 1 year and was recognized by the organization with a special award for " Creativity in Recruitment and Retention . " In addition , the increased retention of new and tenured staff made it possible to reduce the number of traveler RNs by 58% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve in the wake of these achievements . In addition to the recruitment award , the unit was also organizationally recognized for " Best Team Spirit " and " Most Improved Customer Satisfaction . " <p> Employee satisfaction of the unit improved as seen in the hospital 's 2002 Employee Satisfaction Survey . The orthopaedic nursing staff reported a 91.2% likelihood of encouraging friends to apply , and an overall employee attitude score of 94.1% ( Press Ganey , 2002 ) . The initial financial investment of this program was heaviest in orientation hours , yet long-term savings were substantial in lower nurse turnover , reduced traveler expense , and quality of care improvements . Quality of nursing care improved with increased job satisfaction over the year as seen in patient satisfaction measures and quality measurement studies . For example , between 2001 and 2002 , the patient fall rate decreased from 4.06 per 1000 patient days to 2.86 per 1000 patient days ( annualized ) . We also saw an increase in medication error reporting from an average of 4.06 per month to 6.75 per month in the year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization views this as a positive outcome from increased education of medication administration safety . Nursing staff was more comfortable with reporting errors and near misses in a teaching environment . Patients were surveyed using a nationally recognized customer service tool . The results within 1 year showed significant improvements in these measures . Figure 3 shows a comparison of the average annual patient satisfaction percentiles in five key areas between 2001 and 2002 : Friendliness/courtesy of nurses Skill of nurses Professionalism of nursing staff Staff worked together to care for you Likelihood of recommending hospital Discussion <p> Since 2001 , the ONTP has produced eight RN new graduates and one LPN new graduate . It also served as a useful tool for assisting experienced nurses with limited orthopaedic background . This program was presented at a national Recruitment and Retention Conference last year by the author ( Figure 4 ) , and was recognized in the Magnet accreditation process as a showcase program . The orthopaedic unit publicly celebrates Orthopaedic Nurse 's Day with an " Open House " featuring poster presentations and guided tours of the unit to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ONTP nurses are encouraged to join their professional association . This event has been extended to the public as a bone and joint wellness education effort with the endorsement of the United States Bone and Joint Decade initiative . The open house was featured in one of the USBJD intranet newsletters last year . <p> Future plans for the ONTP may include a periodic physician satisfaction survey and possible cross-training of new RNs with other departments , such as ambulatory surgery or recovery room . This program may also prove useful for more advanced roles , such as charge nurse . The development and evolution of this program empowers nurses to grow and maintain their most important , yet vulnerable , nurses . We find that " growing our own " is well worth the investment in a new generation of professional orthopaedic nurses . <p> The ONTP used a single dedicated preceptor to bridge the gap between structured clinical student assignments and real-world work experience . <p> Each week focused on a particular goal .
