Abigail Johnson could n't have been handed the reins at a tougher time . It was May 2001 , squarely amid the worst bear market since the 1930s , when she was promoted to president of Fidelity Management &; Research and put in charge of investment operations . Who put her there ? Her father Edward C. ( Ned ) Johnson III , whose own father founded the mutual-fund giant in 1946 . So you could say she 's had a comfort level most executives never enjoy . There 's also the cushion of being worth nearly $10 billion as heir to the privately held Fidelity juggernaut . " She 's cool and calm , and she works hard every day , " says Eric Kobren , editor of the independent newsletter Fidelity Insight . " She does n't have that air of being one of the richest people in the world . " Or of managing one of the world 's largest pots of money , $893 billion in mutual-fund assets . <P> Johnson , 42 , has seen to it that Fidelity 's technology is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a CEO meeting anywhere in the world and within minutes determine which fund managers are interested in the stock , and file a research note to them . Now she 's reinvigorating a performance-driven culture , giving Fidelity some sizzle by encouraging managers to make bigger bets on their best ideas . That 's how Peter Lynch turned Fidelity into a household name . Ned Johnson has been speaking for the firm during the fund scandals that erupted last fall ; he 'll take the heat if trouble reaches Fidelity 's doors . But very soon , trouble or no , his daughter will be in control  --  and by all accounts she 's ready .  --  By Daniel Kadlec
