<p> A second-grader in Indiana pulls off his shoe and wields it as a weapon , striking his teacher . <p> A kindergartner in Philadelphia punches a pregnant teacher in the stomach . <p> An 8-year-old in Maryland threatens to burn down his suburban elementary school , plotting where he 'll pour the gasoline . <p> Elementary school principals and safety experts say they 're seeing more violence and aggression than ever among their youngest students , pointing to what they see as an alarming rise in assaults and threats to classmates and teachers . <p> " Some of my most violent kids have been in kindergarten , first and second grade , " an elementary school principal in rural Wisconsin says . " They simply lose control , and it comes out in extremely violent manners . " The principal did not want her name used . <p> A few experts take issue , saying schools have always seen troubled youngsters in primary grades . They say high-profile school shootings in recent years have simply made educators more attuned to misbehavior at a younger age . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part schools are very safe places , " says Jamie Ruppmann , a Virginia advocate for families of special education students . <p> School safety consultants insist that they 're seeing more young students acting out . <p> " This is the first year I 've gotten a call from a teacher who said , ' I got beaten up by a kindergartner and I 'm out on medical leave , ' " says Ron Stephens , who heads the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village , Calif. , which tracks school violence for the federal government . <p> Chuck Hibbert , coordinator of security for the Wayne Township , Ind. , schools , where the second-grader wielded his shoe last month , says more primary school students are " kicking and biting and scratching and hitting " both their classmates and teachers . In many cases , police are called to the schoolhouse door . <p> " If someone had asked me this 10 years ago : ' Chuck , how many primary school students have you responded to ? ' I would have said , ' None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . <p> Though few federal figures exist on very young children and violence , a few state and local statistics suggest that violence by younger children is rising and that schools are cracking down on children as young as kindergarten . <p> Crime rates drop , not assaults <p> In California , for example , the latest school crime figures show that from 1995 to 2001 , rates of vandalism and other offenses dropped among elementary school students , while " crimes against persons , " such as assault , nearly doubled . <p> With few resources to combat the problem  --  it 's rare that elementary schools have full-time counselors or social workers  --  schools often resort to stricter discipline to get the attention of kids and parents . <p> * In Philadelphia , the first part of this school year brought the suspensions of 22 kindergartners . <p> * Minneapolis schools have suspended more than 500 kindergartners over the past two school years for fighting , indecent exposure and " persistent lack of co-operation , " among other offenses . Statewide , Minnesota schools have suspended nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting , disorderly conduct and the like . <p> * In Massachusetts , the percentage of suspended students in prekindergarten through third grade more than doubled between 1995 and 2000 , while that of suspended high-schoolers dropped in every grade but 12th . High school students still accounted for 56% of all out-of-school suspensions , while the younger students accounted for about 5% . <p> * In 2001-2002 , schools in Greenville , S.C. , suspended 132 first-graders , 75 kindergartners and two preschoolers . <p> Educators blame everything from rising rates of mild disabilities to violent video games to a poor economy . <p> Richard Barbacane , who chairs disciplinary hearings for the Lancaster , Pa. , school district , says more children are arriving at school from stressed , single-parent homes . He also suspects medical problems such as fetal alcohol syndrome . <p> " Children now are surviving pregnancies and births that 10 years ago they were n't , and they 're coming to school with minimal brain dysfunction and growing needs , " he says . " We 're just now seeing these children in our schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say many children are actually suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress disorder . <p> Barbacane says students do n't even need to watch The Sopranos to see adults behaving badly  --  they can turn to an NFL football game and see red-faced , clipboard-wielding coaches berating the referees . <p> " These are the people who are in charge , " he says . <p> Jim Kelly , chief of the Palm Beach County , Fla. , school police , says the past two years have brought police officers into elementary schools for the first time , often to deal with parents who become angry when their children are disciplined . <p> " A lot of times they 're dealing with parents that are very intimidating or violent , " Kelly says . " Parents are becoming a major issue in the schools  --  just like road rage , you get parents coming in who have a lot of anger . " <p> Though the Department of Education keeps figures on school violence , most do n't specify the age of the child responsible . Overall , federal figures show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1999-2000 school year , 9% of elementary and secondary school teachers were threatened by a student ; that 's down from 12% in 1993-94 . In both years , 4% of teachers were attacked by a student . <p> But the percentage of elementary school teachers who said they were attacked rose from 4.9% to 5.5% , while the percentage of secondary teachers who said the same dropped , from 3.2 % to 2.1% . <p> Federal figures also show that of the 3,523 students who were expelled in the 1998-99 school year for bringing a gun to school , one in 10 was in elementary school . <p> Bill Modzeleski , director of the federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools program , says discipline referrals for very young students still pale in comparison to those of middle- and high-school students . He and others caution that younger students are n't getting more violent ; schools are simply focusing more on the root causes of violence . <p> " I think we 're getting a better look at what 's happening , " Modzeleski says . " We 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " <p> Margaret Boling Mullin , assistant principal at Stout Field Elementary School in Wayne Township , says schools are making an attempt to intervene earlier with counseling , crisis intervention and peer mediation programs . <p> " As an educator , I have to take a child where he or she is and help them move to more healthy habits , " she says . " But I do n't want to get sucked into ' The sky is falling , it 's all getting worse no matter what we do . ' " <p> As in Pennsylvania , schools in several states are increasingly suspending even young students , often referring them to court-ordered alternative programs and required family counseling . <p> In Fairfax County , Va. , several elementary schools are home to schools-within-schools , where area students with discipline problems attend class . <p> ' Stupid , stupid , stupid policy ' <p> Temple University psychology professor Irwin Hyman says the rise in Philadelphia suspensions is a result of a zero-tolerance policy that forces principals to report all violent incidents , even minor ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid policy , " he says . " When a 5-year-old comes in violent , where does it come from ? It comes from his home . And you 're going to send him home ? " <p> Philadelphia officials defend this year 's 22 suspensions as minuscule compared with the city 's total population of more than 16,000 kindergartners . District spokeswoman Cecilia Cummings says schools use suspension as a last resort . <p> " We 're engaging parents when other avenues have failed to do so , " she says . <p> Kathleen Boundy , co-director of the Center for Law and Education in Boston , which represents low-income children , says the idea of suspending a kindergartner , even to get the parents ' attention , puzzles her . <p> " It just seems to me a warped logic when we deny children education and then wonder why they do n't succeed , " she says . <p> Ruppmann , the special education advocate , says schools ca n't wait until children are in kindergarten to work with families if they hope to stem the tide of bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we always do , which is to hand-wring and suspend , " she says . <p> She and others say teachers simply have to be trained to calm anxious or traumatized children . <p> Dan Losen of the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University calls the tougher discipline " part of the tsunami of intolerance " for bad behavior that also harshly punishes lesser offenses such as dress code violations , tardiness and other minor misbehaviors . <p> " Any school psychologist who knows anything will tell you that it 's totally inappropriate to be suspending a kindergartner who is n't really posing a serious threat , " he says . <p> " Developmentally they 're not learning anything by the suspension . Kids that age need an immediate response that 's a logical consequence for their behavior . " <p> Ohio school safety consultant Ken Trump worries that new federal rules allowing students to transfer out of " persistently dangerous " schools will tempt principals to underreport crime among all age groups . <p> " School administrators are going to be very , very cautious in terms of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being slapped with the label of ' persistently dangerous , ' " he says . <p> But Modzeleski says schools are beginning to realize that they need to deal with school violence from an early age . <p> " It 's a sign that these problems do n't just begin in junior high school , " he says . " These problems are there in elementary school . " <p> TEXT WITHIN GRAPHIC BEGINS HERE <p> Suspensions rise for youngest students <p> Many students have turned to more stringent discipline for even their youngest students .
