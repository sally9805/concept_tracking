There were no cures or miracle breakthroughs reported at the big Alzheimer 's conference in Philadelphia last week , but there were glimmers of hope for the families of the 4.5 million Americans who suffer from the disease . <P> The best news was that scientists have found  --  for the first time  --  a drug that delays the onset of Alzheimer 's in patients with mild cognitive impairment .
