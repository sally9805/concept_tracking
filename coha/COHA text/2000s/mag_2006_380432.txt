For 127 years , shopping on Chicago 's State Street meant one thing : Marshall Field 's , the hallmark department store that has stood at that address since the White Sox were the White Stockings . Come September , the store 's new parent , Federated Department Stores , will rechristen it Macy 's , and loyal Marshall Field 's customers are both angry and genuinely sad . " For some chain to come into Chicago and think we 're New York is totally misguided , " says June Cuci , 48 , who has been shopping at Field 's since her childhood . Even film critic Roger Ebert lamented the loss . " I thought the day would never come , " he wrote . " I am looking at my Field 's charge card , which I just cut up into tiny pieces . They look like little tears the color of money . " <P> Sentimental shoppers will have a lot to cry about in the coming months . With the merger last year between department-store chains Federated and May , 78 stores are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name attached to more than 800 stores , will soon expand as big as a balloon in its Thanksgiving Day parade . The majority of the hometown retailers owned by May , including Marshall Field 's , will be converted to the Macy 's nameplate this fall , among them Kaufmann 's in Pittsburgh , Pa. ; Filene 's in Boston ; Strawbridge 's in Philadelphia ; Foley 's in Houston ; Famous-Barr in St. Louis , Mo. ; and Robinsons-May in Southern California . Federated has already renamed South Florida 's Burdine 's , Bon March in the Northwest , Rich 's in Atlanta and Lazarus in Ohio . Only May 's Lord &; Taylor chain has retained its name  --  and it is up for sale . <P> It is all part of Federated CEO Terry Lundgren 's plan to make Macy 's a truly national department store . " This has n't been done before , " Lundgren told TIME . " Macy 's is a great brand that has never been maximized to its full potential . " After decades of bankruptcies , closings and consolidation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional , mid-priced mall-based American department store standing . Its future matters not just to Federated shareholders but also to a $100 billion chunk of the retail economy . Everyone from fashion designers to cosmetics companies to small-town malls is praying that Lundgren 's strategy works . Department stores have struggled for years : they 've cut service , cut prices , cut inventory and still lost customers to cheaper ( Wal-Mart ) or more stylish ( Kohl 's , Target ) discounters and to specialty stores ( Nordstrom ) with top-end service . Millions of Americans , especially in the nation 's midsection , will soon have their first chance to shop at Macy 's . The company now has to give them a reason to do so .
