The evening that I Love Lucy first went on the air , the director and his wife invited us all to have dinner and watch the premiere . Lucy and Desi were there , along with producer Jess Oppenheimer and his wife , Vivian Vance and her husband , and our editor , Dann Cahn . We gathered around the 12-in. screen to watch the opening episode , " The Girls Want to Go to a Nightclub . " We had seen the show at the filming , so there was n't much laughter . But Vivian 's husband Phil Ober , who had n't been at the filming , was laughing so hard he almost fell out of his chair , which we hoped was a good omen . <P> When the reviews appeared , they were mixed . The Hollywood Reporter gave it a rave . Daily Variety said the show needed work , but the New York Times thought it had " promise . " TIME called it " a triumph of bounce over bumbling material . " ( Apparently the magazine had a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cover in May 1952 . ) When the ratings came out , I Love Lucy was in the Top 10 , and six months later it reached No. 1 . People ask why the show was an immediate hit and has remained popular for more than 50 years . Most of the credit goes to the incredible comedy genius of Lucille Ball . <P> I Love Lucy established a lot of records . It has been seen by more than 1 billion people . But one of the show 's biggest contributions to the entertainment world was something that happened before we ever went on the air . In the early ' 50s , most TV shows were performed for live broadcast in New York City , and stations around the country played a kinescope , a copy of the show filmed from a TV screen , which was n't of good quality . But Lucy and Desi were expecting their first child , and they did n't want to move to New York . So Desi got a group of top technical people together who figured out how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience . CBS said that would cost too much , so Desi and Lucy took a cut in salary and in return were given the rights to the negatives of the films . Thus the three-camera film system , still used for situation comedies today , was created , and the rerun was born . <P> Davis and Carroll co-wrote the pilot for I Love Lucy and stayed with the show for six years
