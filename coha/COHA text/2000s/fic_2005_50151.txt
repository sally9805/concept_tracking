Mike Shultz 's fiction has appeared in The Leading Edge and is forthcoming in Black Gate . His first story for us is sure to be a hit with everyone who bought one of those Librarian Action Figures with amazing push-button shushing action . ( And by the way , if you check out **25;2263;TOOLONG , you 'll see this great quotation from Nancy Pearl , the woman who modeled for the figure : " The role of a librarian is to make sense of the world of information . If that 's not a qualification for superhero-dom , what is ? " ) <p> I WAS NINETY-FIVE YEARS old the day Pavo severed me from the Library . As the oldest codexer alive , and the third oldest ever , I 'd believed no one would dare , out of respect at least . But he was Nexus of the Library . The decision to sever me from my life 's work , my passion , from everyone I cared about , was his to make . Pavo is my son . The day it happened began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of everyone . " I 'll tell you what he did , " I told Circinus , a fellow codexer , as we stood in the stacks . ( He 'd missed the meeting . ) " Pavo said I miscataloged a tome , and that I 've made other mistakes , too . " " Sagittal " he said , glancing around to make sure no one heard . " He 's the Nexus ! I know he 's your son , but .... " " The Nexus should n't be questioned ? " I snorted . " When I was Nexus , and I acted like an ass , I appreciated when someone pointed it out . " " Oh , yes . You were the softest-tongued Nexus the Library has ever known , " Circinus said . " Like the time you yelled at a young codexer who 'd accidentally dropped a tome . " " I remember the one . Somnetic Properties of Aquatic Herbs . " I closed my eyes and rested my hand on the row of books beside me . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still has a dent on the corner from when you dropped it . " " You can still feel the stacks like that ? " He shook his head . " Amazing . That 's not even your domain . " " It used to be , " I said , feeling my irritation rise . " Before Pavo took that section away from me . " " Less work for you , " Circinus said , turning to face the stacks . He tapped in a few jutters , putting their spines back in alignment with the rest of the row . As he moved to another section , I spotted one he missed - it was only jutting by a few hairspans - and surreptitiously fixed it . " And maybe it 's for the best , " he added softly . " What the hell is that supposed to mean ? " After a pause , he said , " Did you do it ? " " Do what ? " " Miscatalog the tome . " " Of course not ! Never in my whole life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look , Sagitta . I 'm twenty years younger than you , and I forget things sometimes . No one blames you . But you know how much pressure the sorcerers put on the Nexus . They want the Library maintained perfectly . Pavo does whatever keeps them happy . " " You agree with him . You think I 'm not up to the job anymore . " " I did n't say that . You make it sound worse than it is . But you have to admit that - " " Did n't I just prove to you a moment ago how well I can still do my job ? " I was furious , nearly enough to throw books on the floor . " I do n't know , " Circinus said . " But Pavo 's the Nexus , and it 's up to him to decide if you - if you can still - " " I think I 've had enough of this , " I said , then turned and walked away . " Oh , come on , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to walk faster , but the old pain in my ankle did n't let me . I clenched my fists , yellowed nails biting into my leathery palms . " Sagitta , I did n't mean it like that , " he called after me . I was glad he did n't follow me . If only a shaft had been nearby . I would 've gotten on the aster disk and glided up out of earshot in an eyeblink . Then again , riding aster disks made me dizzy lately . I had to keep back from the edge like a frightened child . As it was , I hobbled away as fast as my decrepit old legs would carry me . When I could n't hear him anymore , I slumped against a support column . Ten years ago , I would 've continued the slump until my hind end hit the floor . But I knew better , now . If 'd be a long time getting up if I did that . I was old and falling apart . But that was my body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His motivation was jealously . He could n't stand the idea of his father still walking the stacks , a father who knew them as well as he did . He claimed he was faster . Fah . I served my time and stepped down when a qualified replacement was ready . Not because I was losing my touch . That 's the way it has been done for centuries . I knew every tome in the Library the day I retired as Nexus . That 's how the title is earned , and that 's how I left it . Four million , three hundred thirty-three thousand , nine hundred and two tomes , last one acquired three days ago - Techniques of Hyperkinetic Agitation , a training manual for students of the conflagra branch of sorcery . I took a deep breath through my nostrils , soaking in the smells . Lizardskin bindings . Ancient wood . A trace of cleaning oil . All wonderful . Gazing up into the heights , I allowed my consciousness to meld with the stacks . Twenty-three levels at this particular spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dim glow of the sorcer-lights . Sometimes I imagined that the warm rows of tomes went on forever in all directions , that I could spend the rest of my days strolling the high halls with my fingertips brushing the curved bindings , hearing and feeling the rap-rap-rap of my rough skin against the scales , the sorcerer 's runes on their backs flashing like lightning into my head .... Echoing laughter drifted to my ears . I sighed and let my hand fall from the books . I did n't remember putting it there . I was about to slink off and get back to work when I realized who was coming . A group of children , prospective codexers on a tour of the Library . I was ten years old when my parents brought me for the testing . Only a third of the prospects make it , and they 've already been through three years of training and culling . At first my teachers were n't so sure about me , but I 'd known I would be accepted from the moment I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Codexer Mira leading them . My wife , Jahaia , passed away twenty years ago , - her patience and sense of humor are irreplaceable . But something about Mira reminded me - with vague feelings of disloyalty - of fahaia . Maybe it was Mira 's sharp wit or her strength of spirit . Mira was twenty-five years younger than I , though , and probably would 've been appalled to know my feelings , so I kept them hidden . The children were a diverse group - a boy in a rich red coat , shoving , grabbing and shouting ; a girl in tattered clothes looking at Mira with a smile that outshone the sorcerer 's lights ; a boy with long , braided hair , dragging his feet , speaking to no one ; a girl with curly tresses at the rear trailing her fingers along the books ... a dozen in all . " Good morning to you , Codexer Sagitta , " Mira said , bringing them to a stop . " Children , do you see Codexer Sagitta 's hands ? What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prune , " the boy in the red coat said . " He looks old as books . " Fearless and rude . But with some guidance , he 'd make a good codexer , perhaps as a representative to the sorcerers . A number of the children giggled at his wisecrack . " Oh , yeah , " I said , holding up my hands . " See them big hairs ? One time " dexerMira here thought there were spiders on them and swatted me with a cleaning rag . " They laughed . " Well , do n't just stand there giggling , " I said . " Answer her question . " Eventually the girl at the back who 'd been trailing her hands on the books slowly raised her hand . From her finger-trailing and the awed look in her eyes , I sensed that she had great potential . " Yes , young lady ? " Mira said . " He 's not wearing any rings . " " Very good ! " Mira said . " They 're the latest fashion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't wear them ? " Silence . I looked at the girl who 'd answered . Her dark curls hid her face as she turned back to stare at the books . " Well , if no one knows , " Mira said , " I 'm not going to - " " She knows . " I indicated the girl with a tilt of my head . " Young lady ? Excuse me , young lady ? " The other children snickered to one another , but the girl did n't seem to hear them . The boy in the red coat stepped forward . " I know . Because the rings would scratch the books . " " A good answer , and something we must n't ever do , " I said . " But not correct . " He made an irritated face and looked down . " And we 're not telling you until somebody figures it out , " Mira added . I nodded , approving wholeheartedly . She was the best codexer with the children , and she knew how to teach them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . My attention , however , was on the girl at the back . I was burning with curiosity . She was obviously connecting to the Library , but to what extent ? I wanted to talk to her alone . " Well , children , enjoy the rest of the tour , " I said , giving Mira a pointed look . She interpreted me well , glancing at the girl and nodding . " Time to move along , children , " she said , heading off down the aisle . " Remember what I said we would do if you behaved ? " " The aster disk ! " they shouted , following eagerly after her . Dark-curls did n't follow at first . When she did , she walked with her fingers grazing the spines of the books . I stopped her after a few steps . " What 's your name ? " I said . She tore her eyes away from the stacks . " Cael . " " Did you hear Codexer Mira 's question , Cael ? " She nodded , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , dead these many years . She 'd been a fisher , an occupation I could scarcely imagine . The Out was a harsh place . " Well ? " " You ca n't feel the books as good with rings , " she said . " That 's why I took mine off . " " I noticed . Do you want to see something neat ? " " This is already wonderful , " she said , looking up and around . My lip trembled . I had to close my eyes for a moment before I could continue . The future of the Library stood before me . Who was 1 to teach her ? I whispered a prayer to the Author of Life , asking for humility . " Follow me , " I said when I recovered . I was enjoying myself so much that I hardly noticed the pain in my ankle and the dull ache in my back as I stood and strolled along the stacks , fingers trailing low . Soon , I felt the heartbeat of her soft fingers against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known she was trailing if I was deaf and blind . She said nothing as we made our way down the long corridor and turned away from the rest of the children . I led her up a spiral that put me out of breath , and down a vertical shaft on an aster disk , almost not noticing how dizzy it made me . As we glided down , I demonstrated to her the rhythm of swiping the books as we dropped past each shelf . In my eagerness to show her more , I stepped off of the disk at the bottom a moment too soon . My ankle twisted , waking old agonies , but I did my best to ignore it , leading her through a winding hall that branched a dozen times , and finally to the wide avenue of the third axis . " Let 's stop here , " I said , trying to keep the pain from my face . Each step was excruciating . " That was amazing , " she said , her eyes slightly glazed . " Answer quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch ? " " Five thousand two hundred and twelve . " She immediately seemed startled that the answer had popped out of her mouth . Her count was correct . Mine was four higher , but we started and finished at slightly different places . " You must 've been concentrating really hard to count correctly all that way . I think I 'm going to see you here again . " " Do you really think so ? " The look on her face nearly broke my heart . " I do . But now it 's time for you to go back to your group . " " What are you going to do ? " " Crawl into a corner and hide so no one can see my ugly old hands , " I blurted . My ankle was on fire . The boy was right - I was old and worn out . " My grandmother got mad at me for saying something like that once . Like that boy said to you . She put peach jam on my bread instead of apple , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from my sister . " " What did she say to that ? " " Nothing . She smeared a blob of scallion paste over the peach jam and handed it to me . She knows I hate scallions . " " And so you realized her memory was n't so bad after all . I think I 'd like your grandmother . " " She died . That 's why my village sent me here , so no one would have to take care of me . How do I get back ? " I 'd heard of such things , but it saddened me that Gael knew it . " With these , " I said , twiddling my fingers and reaching to the nearest shelf . " The other children have been touching the books , and there 's a fresh trail of divots and jutters to follow . " She headed off , fingers trailing . I kept track of her progress through the books until she made it back to Mira . With her happy presence gone , my anger at Pavo rushed in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea . I grabbed a return that needed to be shelved and limped along the stacks , searching . My ankle throbbed , but I was too upset to care . I soon found its place . I brushed my fingers along the spine of the book in my hands . Transmorphic Stoneworking : Slate and Shale . I slipped it in upside-down . The background buzz of its discontinuity with the rest of the Library would send my fellow codexers into a tizzy for the next few hours , trying to find it . Too long like that and its magic would change in ways that the sorcerers refused to explain - but vehemently warned us against . Pavo would feel the discontinuity the worst , like a bug crawling in his ear . But odds were good that he was in a meeting with a sorcerer and would n't be able to attend to it immediately . In any case , he 'd have to deal with it eventually . But would he know that it had been deliberate , as Gael had when her grandmother gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be happy . He found me humming to myself as I brushed stray dust motes from a row of tomes on telekinesis in my domain . I wanted him to see me doing something active ; the trick would be not wincing if I took a step that my ankle did n't approve of . " What do you think you 're doing ? " he said . " Dusting . " " I do n't mean right now , codexer . I mean when you put Transmorphic Stoneworking in upside-down . " So ; he knew it was deliberate . That was something . I turned to face him . " Codexer , is it ? " " Or maybe you 're truly no longer qualified to be a codexer , and you just want me to think it was an accident . " He was baiting me . But I could play , too . " Codexer , is it ? " I repeated . " Stop saying that . This is n't funny . " " Codexer , is it ? " Pavo 's chin started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of tough meat . Did n't he know that I knew all of his quirks ? I had him riled , and I was glad . " Yes , you are a codexer , and I 'm the Nexus , " he said . " That means it 's my responsibility to make sure every book is in its place . And you messed up . Again . " " You 're practically yelling , Pavo . Trying to gather a crowd ? " He leveled a finger at me . " You 're losing another row . Continue with the insubordination and it will be two . " My own son was pointing at me and making threats . Suddenly it was n't fun anymore . " What would your mother think if she saw you now ? " I took a step forward as I spoke . Mistake . Pain shot up my leg . I hoped it had n't shown on my face . " Do n't bring her into this , " he said . A pair of codexers appeared at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you tell everyone I miscataloged a book ? " " What are you talking about ? I have n't told anyone yet . " " No , not Transmorphic Stoneworking . Remember your accusation at the meeting this morning ? When you humiliated me in front of everyone ? " More onlookers had gathered ; I saw Circinus among them . " Nexus , you summoned us ? " Circinus said , approaching at the front of the growing crowd . " Yes . I want everyone here for this . " " Everyone here for what ? " I asked . Pavo paced back and forth across the aisle , his wide blue Nexus robe swaying . " I 'm not waiting , " I said . " Out with it . " " I ca n't protect you anymore , Father . " I knew my fate immediately . He meant to sever me from the Library . I 'd be cast into the Out to live in a dirty old house , get rain on my head , sunburn , bug bites . Walk through dung-strewn streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the Library again was far worse . I knew what happened to men my age who were severed . No purpose in life . No meaning . Empty time , aching bones . My mind would waste away without the books to keep me sharp . Soon , I 'd forget my great-grandchildren 's names and my body would fall to dust . And they 'd all look at me and think , what a poor old man . Old as books . My children would hold my arm on my way to the privy . They 'd speak loud and slow , and ask me if I 'd eaten enough . Cut my meat and wipe drool from my chin . I did n't want to be pitied . " Do n't you think you 're being a bit hard on him , Nexus ? " someone said from beside me . Mira . I had n't heard her approach . Blessed , fearless Mira . " No , " Pavo said . " In fact - " That 's when I did it . It was all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf and shoved them onto the floor . The assembled crowd gaped . Pavo 's eyes filled with rage . " How dare you - " But I was n't finished . I put my arm in the breach I 'd created and swept a long swath of books onto the floor . None of us had ever seen books lying in a jumbled pile , and for a moment we all stared . " Codexer Sagitta , " Pavo said , " I hereby sever you from all of your domain , for all time . " " That 's not fair , " Mira said . " You drove him to it . " I was devastated when no one else spoke in my defense . I could n't look at them , afraid I 'd see either pity or scorn . Instead , I reached my hand to the books on the shelf below the one I 'd emptied and closed my eyes . My consciousness melded with the Library . " The book you accused me of miscataloging this morning was Classification of Quasi-Spiritual Entities . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , first level , three hundred seventh book from the end . " " Incredible , " someone said . " That 's my domain , but he 's exactly right . " " Last taken out by Sorcerer Kymiros Telfanor last year on the fifteenth day of New Harvest , " I continued . " Before that , by Sorcerer Lycha Umbada ninety-eight years ago on the first day of Coldbreaking . " " Do you even know all of this ? " Mira said to Pavo . " I most certainly do . But I ... " The anger that had been in his voice a moment before had vanished . " But you what ? " I asked . " Father , you 're too slow . " I could n't believe it . " Put your hand on the stacks , boy . Then somebody ask us a question . Let 's see who 's slow . " " No . That 's not what I mean . " Pavo 's eyes met mine . " Last month , Sorcerer Tamiqua needed a book urgently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't pleased . " " You did n't tell me that . " " And it was n't the first time . Even when you use an aster disk , Dad , you 're slow . I see you struggling to keep your balance on them . One of these days you 'll fall , and then .... " Whether it was my angry energy abandoning me , or the effort of shoving the books onto the floor , I do n't know , but with terrible suddenness , my ankle gave way , and I collapsed , landing curled up on my side . " Father ! " Pavo rushed to my side and reached for my hands , but I batted him away . Mira joined him , and I loved her fiercely for the look she gave me . It was n't sympathy or pity , but You stood up to him . I 'm proud of you . I did n't feel worthy . " So it was n't my mind , " I said to Pavo . " You do n't think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Honestly , I wondered about that , too . But after your display of Nexus-knowledge .... " I nodded . We agreed . My body was the problem , not my mind . With the way my ankle felt , I did n't think I 'd be walking again for months , if ever . I wanted to weep . But I would not . My tears would not stain these floors . Their moisture would not pass into the air and contribute in some small measure to the rot and decay of precious paper . I was a codexer , and I loved the Library too much to soil it . " I relinquish my domain , " I said . My voice cracked , and I probably sounded like an old fool , but I was in far too much pain to care . THEY PLOTTED behind my back . The gall of them ! The nerve ! As I sat in my room ashamedly instructing a servant in the packing of my meager assortment of belongings , they met and worked it out . Codexer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea initially . Circinus had a heavy hand in it . And my own son , they say , sat there the whole time , nodding and smiling . Then Pavo came and told me to stop packing . I have n't figured out how to pay them back , yet . Maybe I 'll have the children slip egg yolks into their shoes at night , or put crickets in their wardrobes . " Sagittal " I heard the patter of small feet and turned to the source of the call . She had her hands behind her back . Dark curls hung to her brows . " Gael , " I said . " Did you find it ? " She nodded vigorously and withdrew the book from behind her back . " Good . Where 's the others ? " " They 're slow . They 're coming , though . " " Slow , huh ? " I leaned forward in my firm wooden chair , judiciously positioned near the center of the Library , and tickled her . She giggled and squirmed . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What next ? " she asked . At that moment , the rest of my students rounded the corner and ran softly down the aisle to join us . One day , when Pavo was ready , he 'd relinquish his title , perhaps to one of them . " There 's twelve books out of place , one per axis , " I announced . " One for each of you . Find them . " " I 'll be back first this time ! " Leo said . He 'd relinquished his rich red coat for a student 's gray . They dashed to the nearest row and put their hands on the books , listening to the Library 's whispers , feeling the flow of its long and winding stacks . Soon , they dashed off . I called out a final instruction as they trailed away . " And make it quick ! "
