The average woman spends hundreds of hours washing , drying , and styling her hair each year , and yet 81 percent of women report that they 're not always happy with their coif . What are the most common complaints ? Most of us wish our locks were either fuller or shinier ( or both ) . It should come as no surprise then that more than half of all styling products sold are designed to make tresses either glisten or thicken up . Before you run out and buy another serum or spray , read on to learn the inside scoop : which products really work , the tools worth your investment , and the styling strategies used by the pros . Shiny Hair Secrets 1 . GO NATURAL Daily brushing and styling can take a toll on your tresses , robbing them of natural oils and leading to breakage . Trade in your plastic brush for one with natural bristles ( look for boar ) , which redistribute oils throughout hair as you brush , boosting shine . " The only time I use anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Harry Josh , creative consultant for John Frieda Collection . Natural bristles are also less likely to break hairs . Use them consistently for fewer flyaways . Try the Mason Pearson Sensitive Boar Bristle Brush ( $130 ) . Photograph : Fire up your flatiron . Hair reflects more light when strands are smooth .

AVOID ALCOHOL- LACED PRODUCTS " Alcohol , pollution , and humidity all rob hair of its natural shine , " notes Arsen Gurgov , a top hairstylist at the Louis Licari salons in New York City and Beverly Hills , whose clients include Susan Sarandon and Melanie Griffith . " Most mousses contain alcohol , so if your hair is dry , try a cream or serum instead , " adds Josh . All of the shine-enhancing products in Aveda 's Brilliant line are blissfully alcohol free ( $12-$23 ) . 3 . WASH THE RIGHT WAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that washing a few times a week is sufficient . Skipping shampoo helps hair retain shine but can also leave it limp . " I tell my clients who wash every day to apply conditioner first , keeping it away from the roots , " says Gurgov . " Then , without rinsing in between , apply shampoo just to the roots , lather , and rinse everything out , " he instructs . " Your roots will be lifted , but the rest of your hair will retain its shine . " Try L'Oral Paris Vive Pro Nutri Gloss Conditioner ( $4.99 ) . 4 . RINSE WITH COLD Rinsing hair with cold water closes the cuticle , leaving a smooth , shiny surface . Blasting with cold air after a blow-dry has a similar smoothing effect , and most dryers have a cold setting for this purpose . 5 . FIGHT FRIZZ Hair is porous , absorbing moisture from the environment , which is what causes it to frizz in humid climates . To prevent midday flyaways , make sure your hair is dry before you head out ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later on . Gurgov recommends using a flatiron on the hair that frames your face after you blow-dry , which will remove any excess moisture . 6 . SMOOTH WITH SILICONE Products with silicones lie on top of the hair shaft to seal the cuticle and create a barrier between styling tools and hair , reducing friction and limiting heat damage . Try John Frieda Frizz-Ease Thermal Protection Serum ( $9.99 ) . But like many other things , silicone works best in moderation . " Use too much of it and your hair will fall flat or begin to look greasy , " warns stylist Tommy Buckett , a spokesman for Krastase Paris . Buckett advises his clients with thinner tresses , like Rachel McAdams , to use a misting of a silicone shine spray instead . Try Krastase Paris Vernis Nutri-Sculpt ( $29 ) . 7 . TRY A HEAT TREATMENT " Many women think of heat as something that dries out hair , " says stylist Orlando Pita of New York 's Orlo salon . But used the right way , it can give your hair incredible shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylists put clients under heat during deep-conditioning treatments is that it opens up the cuticle , allowing a mask or oil to penetrate the hair shaft at a deeper level , " explains Pita . If you ca n't get to the salon , apply a mask or a hot-oil treatment at home once a month . " After you 've applied the product , wrap a really hot towel around your head , " instructs Victoria 's Secret spokesman Italo Gregorio , who creates the hair for the brand 's annual fashion show and has shared this tip with A-list clients like Gwyneth Paltrow . Try Rene Furterer Karit Intense Nutrition Oil ( $36 ) . 8 . INVEST IN IONIC TOOLS Dryers and irons that are worth the investment not only protect tresses from frizz and flyaways , they also improve hair health . While traditional tools get hotter as you work , ionic ceramic tools maintain constant heat and pump hair full of cuticle-smoothing negative ions , which improve strength and shine over time . Try the T3 Bespoke Labs Evolution Dryer ( $300 ) . 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duller and drier than straight hair . " Curly hair usually grows slower than straight hair , " explains Buckett , " so the ends are much older and need considerably more moisture than the roots . " If your hair has some natural wave , make sure you get a trim every six to eight weeks , and always use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner . After styling , apply a serum like TIGI S-Factor Dream Drops Shine On ! ( $30 ) to the ends to lock in moisture and shine . 10 . GET GLISTENING WAVES " Shine is about alignment , " notes Proctor &; Gamble senior scientist Leslie Bride . " Light hits each individual hair and reflects back in a certain direction , " she ex-plains , " so when neighboring hair strands are aligned , the reflections all come back to the eye in the same direction , resulting in a crisp shine band . " Curly hair looks shinier when it 's all going in the same direction , which is why big , smooth , structured curls reflect more light than lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry around a barrel curling iron for a few seconds will align them and make them look more polished , " notes Buckett . Try the Conair BaBylissPro Tourmaline Ceramic One-Inch Curling Iron ( $99.99 ) . 11 . Tried And TESTED Here are the best shine-boosting products for your hair type .

" Hair is made of keratin protein , " says Pita , so volumizers with protein attach to hair fibers and build body . Look for wheat , soy , and silk proteins . Try Ojon Hydrating Thickening Shampoo ( $22 ) .

TRY A DIFFUSER Most dryers blow air in a stream , which robs curls of their spring . " For fuller waves , use a diffuser with prongs , " says Buckett . Dry your hair upside down , using the prongs to massage your roots . Photograph : Katie Holmes 's modern bob 3 . A BETTER BLOWOUT Blow-drying gives limp locks a lift . " If your hair is fine , begin by drenching the roots in thickening spray while it 's damp , " instructs Gregorio . Try Victoria 's Secret So Sexy Volumizing Spray ( $12.50 ) . Then , starting from the front and moving back , dry one-inch sections of hair . " Using a round boar-bristle brush , pull each section up toward the ceiling , keeping your dryer aimed at the brush , " he says . " When you reach the ends , curl hair around the brush and roll it back toward the scalp . " When all of the sections are dry , blast your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessica Biel 's layered waves 4 . LAYER YOUR LOCKS Fullness starts with the right haircut . If you have curly hair , layers will take it to new heights . " Shorter layers underneath really boost body , " says Gurgov . " But make sure your stylist cuts with scissors rather than a razor , which creates frizz. " 5 . TRY VELCRO ROLLERS Setting hair with Velcro rollers will give you an unbeatable boost of volume . " Six rollers at the crown make a huge difference , " says Josh . After hair is dry ( but still warm ) , wrap one-inch sections of hair around each roller , following the direction of growth . Leave them on for at least 10 minutes . ( Longer yields a bigger body boost . ) " The key is to roll them really tight , " says Josh . Brushing after you 've taken the rollers out can cause volume to deflate , so just shake hair out and spritz with Herbal Essences Body Envy Hairspray ( $2.99 ) . 6 . LOSE SOME LENGTH Chopping your locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunt bobs , make hair appear thicker and look modern now , " advises Josh. 7 . ADD SOME COLOR Coloring hair fattens up every strand for an overall volume boost . " Processes that involve peroxide or ammonia yield the most dramatic results , pushing the hair shaft open to fluff up even the finest strands , " Josh explains . Semipermanent color also has favorable effects on fullness , though it 's not as noticeable to the naked eye . Simply adding a few highlights can give the appearance of volume , texture , and movement . 8 . THE HIGH-TECH FUTURE Hair-thickening treatments may soon come to your dermatologist 's office . Light BioScience has a new LED light treatment in the works that has docs talking . " This will be the next big thing in hair rejuvenation , " says New York dermatologist Fredric Brandt .
