Now that we 've got a bibliography of our first fifty years on our Website , it should n't be too hard to confirm the theory that we have published more fiction by writers named Robert than by storytellers of any other name . It 's just a hunch , but when you add up the many contributions by Bobs ( such as Messrs . Reed , Leman , Young , Abernathy , Silverberg , Aickman , and Heinlein ) , they probably outnumber all the Toms , Lisas , Sonyas , and even the Isaacs in our pages . Of course there 's also this guy Sheckley , who has graced our pages with a slew of sly and funny stories over the years . His latest takes us to outer space , which remains one of the few places where a person can go to find some solitude . <p> NOW THAT YOU HAVE COME all this great distance to my little world , I beg of you , ladies and gentlemen , sit down and relax . After all , what is the rush ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have paid well for this chance to meet me , and the ship will be there when you want to leave . But what if it is n't ? Does it really matter ? Are you really in such a rush to get to the next place ? What lies at the end of any of these hectic enterprises of the human spirit but a chance to spend some time in this gray , cool , soundless place of mine ? When a man is not going anywhere , on a journey that has no end , he can afford to take his time ! Now , not for the first time , I regret the lack of any busy-work to keep my fingers occupied . How clever the old wives were , to have a bit of sewing always beside them . Penelope must have given herself many pleasant hours , spinning the great web that occupied her days . And was she regretful when she unraveled it at night ? I do n't think so . Spinning the web by day and undoing it at night , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a melancholy turn as I sit here in the dusty old house , in my writing room , looking out over the unweeded garden , with the white light coming out of a white sky , all of it a tabula rasa resembling my mind . But not much in the way of pictures form there . For lack of stimulation , my mind remains as blank as the translucent sky that looms over this place . There on the wall are Arthur 's guns , his fishing rods , and several steel-jawed traps . He used to enjoy these sports , back in what seems another age , when there was energy to burn and time to burn it in . I can even remember , so dimly as to make it more a matter of faith than of recollection , a time when I was eager to get up each morning , when I could hardly wait to finish breakfast and rush out to see what marvels the new day held . That was before I had exhausted the possibilities of this little world . When all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their toll . Back in a day and age that has passed unconsidered , a time when love and adventure seemed possible . None of that is quite true , of course . But sometimes I like to imagine I was born here , rather than inheriting the place after Arthur 's unfortunate demise . But what can I do about it ? Nothing seems possible now except what was done and done to death in all the yesterdays that I have lived here . I hope you find all this more than a little charming , and curiously quaint . I live alone on a tiny asteroid . You think , what joy ! Here 's a man who has it all . A tiny world he can walk around in less than a day ! An entire world to itself , an asteroid with its own atmosphere , with its ancient house , placed here god knows how or by whom , with its unkempt garden , its self-replenishing larder , its silent robot servants who do what is required and speak not , its forest that covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself , this place is perfect , except that one might want a woman to share it with . But then you think , it would have to be a perfect relationship or it would become intolerable . You think again how perfect for one with a hermit turn of mind , one who is not attracted to bars and shows and movies and rude entertainment . But , you wonder , is it possible there is nothing to do here ? Perhaps this man telling the story is lazy . Surely , somewhere in the forest in which this house resides , there is something , some mystery , a recondite matter worthy of investigation . I assure you , gentlemen , there is none . Or if there is one , a single unique feature , be assured that I , and you , too , if you lived in my place , avoid it like the plague . I embrace the usualness of my daily round instead of stumbling once again over that thing which was not planned , not put here by the architects and builders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circumstance did occur . But not to me . I did not live here then . This asteroid world belonged to my friend and benefactor , Arthur . I see that I have piqued your curiosity . But I assure you , I had no intention of doing so . I was but making a point , not proposing an adventure . Anyhow , it was Arthur 's asteroid , you see , and at the time of this story I was just a guy on Earth , in e-mail correspondence with him . Arthur and I had been schoolmates at Black Sycamore University in Vermont . Arthur had soon made the discoveries that made his name famous , and brought him in a lot of money . He did n't care about money until he conceived the idea of living on his own planetoid . It was not a plan that would appeal to everyone . Most of us like a bit of company every now and then . Not everyone ! Not Arthur . Arthur used to envy the anchorites , those early fanatics of Christianity who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived alone and unloved , rapt in their religious contemplation . Arthur was not a religious person , but he did have some things he wanted to think about , and wanted that thinking to be pleasurable and without interruption . Arthur wanted to live in a state of rapture . He did n't think rapture was reserved only for the religious - like a supernatural present from their hypothetic God . No , rapture was for anyone with the guts to do what they had to do to get it . Thus , after he had patented his unique formula for actualizing an imaginary Rhiemann set - or something like that - I 'm not much on science , myself - or perhaps it was his invention of the self-replenishing electrical circuit . After he had done these things , and began reaping the profit , he bought himself an asteroid . It was not too hard to find one for sale . The biggest difficulty , he told me in his e-mails , was finding the correct agency to pay the money to . After that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had dreamed of for a very long time . In his mind 's eye he could see the comfortable lines of the house , the big porch , the view of distant mountains . He was able to sketch out exactly what he wanted , down to the splitrail fences . Then he hired a secretary intelligent enough to translate his desires into actualities . I was that secretary , of course , and Arthur 's dream became mine . MONEY WILL BUY YOU any dream you want . All that remains is for you to fit yourself toit . This can be desperately hard work , to judge from Arthur 's experience on his world . The first weeks went by without difficulty . Arthur was occupied with testing his equipment , making certain that everything worked as it was supposed to . The place was still under warranty , you see . But everything worked as it was supposed to . The artificial gravity , a third less than that of Earth , gave him a sense of lightness and vigor . The robotic servants were silent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , " for personality was what Arthur had come here to get away from . Nevertheless , their silent , programmed self-effacedness and their concern for his wants , programmed though they were , gave him a sense of protection , as if he were living with ideal grandparents . The force-seeded forest came up nicely . Then plants and the constituents of plants grew , as close to simultaneity as makes no mind . The plants had to have those things without which they could not flourish , even allowing for the irresistible way life has of maintaining itself under difficult conditions . Good times in the Arthur rancho ! While I sat home on Earth and paid the bills . But never mind , I 'm here now , that 's all that counts . And I was well paid for my part in keeping Arthur 's dream operative . I 'm not complaining . Arthur said he never felt lonely in those days . He was too vigilant to permit that emotion to live in him , too well trained , too self-schooled in the discipline necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy it by trying to make it better . In the evening , after the artificial Sun had set behind the range of purple-topped mountains which Arthur had terraformed , he would take one glass of the incomparable wine he had imported from France - one glass and no more . He was not being stingy - he had wine that would last far behind his own life . He was being careful . Trying to tread the path of the aesthete rather than that of the gourmand . Trying to remember that measure is everything . Some more caviar , my friends ? And will someone pass the toast points ? No , it was not loneliness that assailed him . But it was something . That is to say , he became aware that something in his scheme of things was not right . When you live on your own asteroid , my friends , you accustom yourself to putting up on the skies images of what you want to live with . You are after a certain harmony , after all . You do n't want strangeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her innumerable mysteries ; you have come to live here , a place without any mystery at all , yet something is not right - could it be that there is something inexplicable here ? When you base your life on aesthetics , little things like " Is there a mystery here ? " tend to take on great weight and moment . Something is not right ! You take it as a clarion call to action . You do n't doubt it . You assume the truth of the statement . You set out to find out what is wrong . To learn what the mystery is . Arthur told me how many days he sat on the glider on his front porch , looking at the range of mountains he had had constructed . They were green now , crowded with growing things , most notably trees and grass , doing nicely with the substitutes for insects that his scientists had come up with . Because once you start trying to create life on a little world , practical difficulties begin getting in your way . You lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for moulting season and what the ideal rainfall should be . For the sake of simplicity , Arthur had dispensed with insects , considering other ways of bringing their benefits to plants in ways sometimes tortuous and clumsy , ad hoc to say the least . But the cost was containable on a little world , and Arthur got his trees and grass one way or another . The next question was , what else was out there on his world ? Imagine that thought as a way of shooting yourself in the foot . You 've gone to the considerable time and expense of building your own world . Nothing can live here except what you brought in . But you become convinced there is something else here , something alien and sinister . You determine to find this alien intruder and demand an account of him . But this , proposition-wise , is putting the cart before the horse . The first question is , is there some creature on your world , sharing it with you without your permission or consent ? The fact that Arthur chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the man . It was his nature to test such an ultimate conclusion . When you try to prove such a premise , you are staking your life on its importance . If you 're smart , you include the negative of the discovery : You could say that Arthur staked his life on the idea that discovering there was nothing there would be as satisfying as to discover there was someone there ; for such became his life ambition . I can empathize with Arthur . I have that sort of mind myself . Luckily , however , with a bit more common sense and a stronger instinct for self-preservation . Arthur made his choices and I , when my time came , made mine . When the time comes to make a choice , initiate an action , produce a defining action , the mind has the bad habit of postponing the point of beginning almost infinitely , making you live Zeno 's paradox of Achilles and the tortoise . Or one 's position is as in Shakespeare 's great speech in Julius Caesar - " Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream . The genius and the mortal instruments are then in session . And the mind of man , like to a little kingdom , suffers then the nature of a resurrection . " How true those words were of Arthur 's state of mind ! He had to find out . And with what iron discipline did Arthur gather a few possessions , set his alarm clock , and , when it had gone off , left his house to explore his asteroid , to find the unknown thing which , he was now convinced , lived in the mountains and ravines on the far side of his world . When Arthur went out exploring that morning , he took the little path that led into a weed-grown ditch , scrambled up the other side , and found himself in a small clearing . That in itself was strange : nothing on the ground plan had indicated any such clearing in the dense vegetation that covered this place under its force-dome . He walked into the clearing slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ahead of him he could see the line of trees where the forest commenced . And there was something else there , something dark and indistinct against the tree line . He could n't quite make it out , but it appeared to be about the size of a person or large animal . As he moved closer , the thing , whatever it was , turned abruptly and vanished into the dark woods . The presence of this creature gave him an excuse for walking , and so he walked on , hurrying a little to keep the dark object in sight as it slid through the trees . He went on . There was no rush . The light was always of an even tenor in this place , and the amount of land to be covered was so minuscule that a man could go around the world twice without tiring himself appreciably . The creature ahead of him darted in and out of the underbrush . Arthur only wished he could get a better look at it . Although he seemed to be moving faster than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither gaining nor losing much ground , and giving no evidence of trying to evade him . " Hey there ! Wait up ! " Arthur called , for there seemed no reason to make a chase out of this . But the creature ( as he assumed it was ) either did n't hear him or refused to acknowledge his presence . Annoyed , Arthur broke into a trot , and now indeed he seemed to be gaining on the being . He was definitely drawing closer , he could make out the human shape of whatever it was , though he could n't hazard a guess yet as to its sex . It seemed to be dark and shaggy , though it might have been wearing a garment of some sort . This was enough to wonder about right here . Let 's stop a moment and consider . If Arthur had had the power , he would have frozen the frame right there , and asked himself , " How did a gorilla creature come to be on my asteroid ? I certainly never authorized the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no animal-type creature ( in which category I included mankind and the insect kingdom ) should be created or in any way introduced into my asteroid . So assuming it was n't a prank on the part of some flunky in one my subunits - which I doubt , since it would be a very expensive prank .... " The creature must have got here somehow , not of its own will and intention , perhaps , but we will examine that question later . For now we are still in the flush of speculation that accompanies seeing an unnatural thing . A gorilla on an asteroid is more of a mystery than a man on an asteroid . The man could have had his reasons , perhaps surrealist or dadist ones , but reasons all the same . The gorilla , so we are told , does not think in this way , not abstractly , not like we do , at least some of us , and at least from time to time . The gorilla has no reason to be there . His case is simpler than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My stop-action interjection should perhaps be ended now , since we are rushing toward the defining moment , albeit in an Achilles and the Tortoise manner . Arthur pushed his way through the underbrush . He could see a rocky outcropping to his left , a steep wall of rock , smooth and without handholds . It served to hem in the thing , for now he saw a precipice to the right , a crack in the asteroid 's surface , not too wide , yet wide enough to make it impossible for the being to jump across . And the outcropping and the precipice angled together , so that , at the point where they met , he 'd have the thing trapped and could inspect it at his leisure . He hurried on , and noticed that the creature had reached the end of the impasse , and had turned , facing him . Its features were still obscured by underbrush , but Arthur thought he could make out a white face , a pale oval within the dark furriness of the thing . It looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an imploring gesture , for the creature was also making a pushing motion with its hands , as if to beg Arthur to turn back and not pursue this matter any further . For one moment Arthur thought of acceding to the creature 's apparent wishes . That would make a fine story ! He imagined himself telling me , " And so , seeing that the creature wanted nothing to do with me , seemed in fear of me , I halted , I made a sort of salute , wishing it well , and I turned and came back the way I had come . " Yes , a good ending . But Arthur was not content with it . Had he run all this way merely to give up at the end , to give up in response to a presentiment so vague as to be barely mentionable ? ( Here , in case you needed it pointed out , was Arthur 's error . He did n't accede to the creature 's wishes . Did n't leave it alone . To do that and live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to plunge on now . ) LESS THAN a dozen feet separated him now from the thing , and he was growing very tired . He must have been running on this asteroid for hours , seduced into believing his strength greater than in fact it was due to the low gravity . But he 'd have plenty of chance to rest soon . He tore through the final remaining bushes and came up to the thing itself . It was manlike , and it was large , and it had its back to the sheer stone of the precipice . As Arthur came up , the creature suddenly launched itself at him , fangs bared , hooked claws outstretched . Before that , however Arthur saw the creature . And then , instead of taking to his heels , which might have saved his life , he pushed his head into the creature 's face , as though trying to look into its deepest soul . Maybe they were using different signaling systems . Either way , the creature thereupon proceeded to tear Arthur apart limb by limb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell it . But I have sworn to tell everything here . " That 's how he died , " Lambert explained later , to his friends , when he met them back in the feasting-place on Earth . " Frightfully torn , with a look of horror on his face . " " I see , " the hypothetical friend says . " And you ? " " Arthur willed everything to me . I was perhaps the only other person he knew who could appreciate his asteroid . And it did n't hurt that I was his old friend and college chum . " " And when you got here - did you go out in search of the creature ? " Here the questioner might pause and consider for a moment . " No , you would n't , would you ? Still , you had to do something , did n't you ? Stands to reason , does n't it ? What did you do ? " At this point in his tale , Lambert always paused , took a drink of whatever was beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I did nothing . " " But the ape - " " This arrangement seems to suit it . We do n't intrude on one another 's space . " " But he could suddenly attack and kill you for no reason , or no reason that you 'd understand . " " Why would he do that ? " You shrug . " Shit happens . " " I pretend it does n't . " " But does that work for you ? " " I figure I 'm doing okay . I 've got my own asteroid . And I have my own perhaps invisible gorilla . " " But why do you do that ? Why did n't you investigate , find out ? " " This is difficult to explain , " Lambert said . " But I have learned one thing in my many travels . In places of danger , it is best to go in courageously and face what comes up . But in places of safety , where you can be sure nothing ever happens or ever will happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desist . The mysteries of dangerous places are such that a man can explore . But the danger in safe places is uncanny , as if the universe itself decreed that no place is to be allowed to exist without its dark and impenetrable uncertainty . Facing danger is one thing , my friends , and I 've done enough of that in my time . But when it comes to uncovering mystery - a wise man leaves the mystery in place , and does not try to penetrate to its banal secret . " " You think the thing was banal ? " the friend persisted . " Oh , no doubt . It might have been something as commonplace as a gorilla , living alone and bothering no one , until Arthur 's pursuit drove it to the extremity of attack . " " A gorilla , " his friend mused . " But how could a gorilla have gotten on this planetoid ? " Lambert shrugged , smiling . " That is part of the mystery which I , for one , do not intend to look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
