Chapter One To be perfectly honest , the day my father Michael died really was n't the worst day of my life . Of course , it has panned out to be the worst , but at the time , it was just the last day in a week of one fun thing after another , all part of what I later learned was a carefully constructed plot to distract us children from the inevitable . Every night my brother Simon and my sister Missy and me were wined and dined by different friends and kin , making for a fast , hectic week that peaked on Saturday , when my best friend Kenneth 's Uncle Lou , who is full-blooded Italian ( like Kenneth wishes he was ) and very sympathetic to Daddy 's plight , took Kenneth and me to Busch Gardens as he works for Anheuser-Busch and gets free tickets . We left early that morning , before five , and got there just as the gates opened , and had a heck of a time except that I puked on the Scorpion , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the park and I must have eaten one chocolate-chip pancake too many , for I got sick as a dog on the first loop , but was man enough to hold my bile till I made it to the bathroom . Other than that , we had a big time . Uncle Lou even bought each of us a copy of the picture they take when you come in the park that Daddy always said was such a rip-off ( fifteen bucks ) though maybe he ( Uncle Lou , that is ) got an employee discount . In any case , I have the picture on my nightstand to this day and have to say that yes , I look quite the happy boy , not a clue in the world that my father was lying on his deathbed four hundred miles away fighting for his last breath . Just me and that idiot Kenneth grinning like possums , Uncle Lou between us , his arms draped loosely around our necks , very Italian and all , like a good-natured mafioso with his two favorite Godsons . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the little tourist towns along US 19 decorated for Christmas , each with its own enticement : mermaids and alligator farms and manatee crossings . We even stopped at some of them as Uncle Lou is divorced and kind of lonely , and all the billboards had these well-matured women in bikinis urging you to drop by . At least , I think that 's why we stopped . It was too dark to see much at any of them , and as the gray December evening gave way to a cold , clear night , I began to get a little antsy with how late it was getting , and Daddy being sick at home . I kept thinking about Mama and how worried she 'd be if I was late , how she always paced around when Daddy was late from Waycross . It started eating at me , made me curse the traffic lights and silently rejoice when it got late enough that they were turned off for the night , blinking yellow through the little towns in the Big Bend till we finally made Perry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on his credit card . It must have been something like two o'clock in the morning by then , not the perfect time for a call home , but I did n't pause for a second because for one thing , with Daddy so sick , our household routine had become hopelessly upended , and for another : my mother never sleeps anyway . I mean , hardly ever . It 's one of her strange old vampire things that we 'd all grown used to , never gave a second thought to knocking on her bedroom door at midnight , or calling home at odd hours of the night . Sure enough , she answered on the second ring , not at all upset or sleepy , just her calm , matter-of-fact self , asking me where we were ; if I 'd had fun . I told her it was big fun , though I 'd almost puked on the Scorpion , and she was the soul of comfort . " Did it make you feel better ? " I had to admit that it did and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , then gave the phone to Daddy , said he wanted to talk to me . I could make out a rustling of sheets and the faint sound of Mama 's voice on the line , calm and rock-solid , catching Daddy up on what I 'd just told her , then his own voice , weak but familiar , which was a relief , as everything else about him had become so strange lately . I mean , if he was n't lying in his own bedroom in his own bed when I left that morning , I would n't even recognize him , he was so awful looking , his face so thin you could count the bones , his hair almost completely gray , and he was only forty-three . Aunt Candace ( Daddy 's older sister ) , who is a nurse , said that 's what pain will do to you , age you , but still , it was very strange , and I was almost glad I could n't actually see him , because over the phone he sounded perfectly fine , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said in his thin , kindly voice , for Daddy was the kind of old-school redneck who was constantly churning out terms of affection for the people he loved . He called Simon Sim or Simbo , called our sister Missy Mimi or Red ( because of her red hair ) , and though I was technically named after my great-grandfather Clayton , he seldom ( if ever ) called me by my given name , but Claybird most of the time , along with Clayman and Big Man and all sorts of variations therein . " Hey , Daddy , " I replied , then I stood there at the counter and gave him a fast travelogue of the day ... ( Continues ... )
