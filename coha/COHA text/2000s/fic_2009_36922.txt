I N T R O D U C T I O N <br>  --   --  <br> Over the last twenty years , goodwilled readers have occasionally asked me if Frank Bascombe , the yearning , sometimes vexatious , narrator of the three novels that make up this sizeable volume  --  if Frank Bascombe was intended to be an American ' ' everyman ? ' ' By this I think these readers mean : is Frank at least partly an emblem ? Poised there in the final clattering quadrant of the last century , beset with dilemmas and joys , equipped with his suburban New Jersey skill-set and ethical outlook  --  do Frank 's fears , dedications , devilings and amusements stand somewhat for our own ? <br> Naturally , I 'm flattered to hear such a question , since it might mean the questioner has read at least one of these books and tried to make use of it . And I can certainly imagine that a millennial standard-bearer might be worth having ; a sort of generalizable , meditative , desk-top embodiment of our otherwise unapplauded selves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause discomfort , but still recognizable enough to make us feel a bit more visible to ourselves , possibly re-certify us as persuasive characters in our own daily dramas . <br> But the truth is that Frank Bascombe as ' ' everyman ' ' was never my intention . Not only would I have no idea how to go about writing such a full-service literary incarnation , but I 'm also sure I 'd find the whole business to be not much fun in the doing . And I still want to like what I 'm doing . <br> In nearly forty years of writing stories of varying lengths and shapes and , in the process , making up quite a large number of characters , I 've always tried to abide by E. M. Forster 's famous dictum from Aspects of the Novel that says fictional characters should possess ' ' the incalculability of life . ' ' To me , this means that characters in novels ( the ones we read and the ones we write ) should be as variegated and vivid of detail and as hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet every day . This incalculability would seem to have the effect of drawing us curiously nearer to characters in order to get a better , more discerning look at them , inasmuch as characters are usually the principal formal features by which fiction gets its many points across . These vivid , surprising details  --  themselves well-rendered in language  --  will be their own source of illuminating pleasure . And the whole complex process will eventuate in our ability to be more interested in the characters , as well as in those real people we meet outside the book 's covers . In my view , this is why almost all novels  --  even the darkest ones  --  are fundamentally optimistic in nature : because they confirm that complex human life is a fit subject for our interest ; and they presume a future where they 'll be read , their virtues savored , their lessons put into practice . <br> To my mind . . . these three Frank Bascombe novels , along with everything else I 've ever written , have been largely born out of fortuity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . I then collected a lot of seemingly random and what seemed like significant things out of the world , things I wanted to make fit into my prospective book  --  events , memories , snippets of what someone said , places , names of places , ideas  --  all , again , conveyed in language ( sometimes just words I liked and wanted to put into play ) . After that , I set about trying to intuit that unruly language into a linear shape that was clear enough to make a reader temporarily give up disbelief and suppose that herein lies a provoking world with interesting people in it . And I did this with the certainty that even if I were working straight from life , and was trying to deliver perfect facsimiles of people directly to the page , the truth is that the instant one puts pen to paper , fidelity to fact  --  or to one 's original intention or even sensation itself  --  almost always goes flying out the window because language is an independent agent different from sensation , and tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of day , the author 's mood , sometimes even maybe the old original intention  --  but many times not . Northrop Frye once wrote that ' ' literature is a disinterested use of words . You need to have nothing riding on the outcome . ' ' Another way of saying that is : the blue Bic pen glides along the page and surprising things always spill out of it . <br> Vastly more than I want my characters to atomize into some general or even personal applicability , I want them first to be radiant in verbal and intellectual particularity , to not be an everyman but to revel in being specifically this man , this woman , this son , this daughter with all his or her incalculability intact . And I make characters with this intention because I think we were all made and become interesting and dramatic and true by the very same method  --  which is to say , again , rather fortuitously . <br> These three novels were never really imagined as a trilogy , but only ' ' developed ' ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly surprised , and pleasantly bemused , by the result . <br> I wrote The Sportswriter in a period of sustained panic in the middle 1980s  --  most of the novel written while I was living in New Jersey , Vermont and Montana  --  and at a time when my writing vocation was threatening to dematerialize in front of me , literally frightening me into a bolder effort than I ever supposed myself capable . Independence Day  --  begun in 1992 , in a rented , seaside house in Jamestown , Rhode Island  --  I first imagined as a novel with no relation to any other book I 'd written . It was to be a story about a beleaguered , wellintentioned divorced father who takes his ' ' difficult , ' ' estranged teenage son on a trip to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown , New York  --  and in so doing draws himself and his son emotionally closer to each other . All seemed to go well through the planning stages ( a year ) . But over that time I began to notice that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my notes , to ' ' sound ' ' like Frank Bascombe 's  --  the character who 'd narrated The Sportswriter . I made dogged efforts to scuttle all thought of a ' ' linked ' ' book . I was fearful of helplessly writing that first novel over again ; fearful of having more ambition than skill or sense ; fearful of gloomy failure . And yet these fears finally succumbed to the recognition that to be given a ' ' voice ' ' and with it an already-plausible character who can transact the complex world in reasonably intelligent , truthful , even mirthful ways , was just too much of a gift from the writing gods to decline . And so Independence Day , after some considerable pre-writing adjustments to my original plan , came into existence . <br> The Lay of the Land , last and longest of these novels , represents as much as anything a straight-on and somewhat less fearful acceptance of the forward momentum of the two previous books , and a concession by me that I 'd backed myself into a corner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a third book in train with the others , or else be a pathetic coward for not trying . And in that way , over the next four years  --  from 2002 to 2006  --  these Bascombe Novels came to their completion . <br> If any of this seems close to the truth , then consider yourself to have encountered something about human beings , of which writers are a sub-species : that we go on being human even when we want to be better ; and also something about the habit of art , that great , intense , optimistic and forward-thinking seduction that seeks magically to change base metal into gold . This alchemy , and our willingness to test it may have something to do with what some people ( but not I ) romantically call talent . But even if the current efforts here do n't turn out to be in every case 24 carat , know at least that I trusted to luck and industry , incalculability and disinterest as well as I possibly could , and that the habit of art is no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these books that follow . <br> Richard Ford <br> Continues ...
