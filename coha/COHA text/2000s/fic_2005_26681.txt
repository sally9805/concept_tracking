When We Meet Again Chapter One When I see London again I shall be the picture of propriety . I shall behave in a respectable manner always . And I shall try very hard to hold on to the woman I have become . Miss Pamela Effington Four years later ... " Well done , Clarissa . " Pamela Effington pulled off her mask and grinned at her opponent . " You nearly had me for a moment . " " Nearly is an understatement , dear cousin . " Clarissa , Lady Overton , drew off her own mask and shook her dark hair free . " Another few seconds , and the point would have been mine . " Pamela laughed . " Fortunately , there was no time left . " " Fortunate indeed . " Clarissa slashed the blade of her fencing foil through the air . " Next time , I shall claim victory . " " As you did in our previous match . " Pamela shook her head with good-natured humor . " We are well suited , cousin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . " But is it really necessary , do you think , for a woman to be skilled with a sword ? It 's not as if we should ever be forced to fight a duel for our honor . " " I 'm not certain a woman can ever have too many skills or too much knowledge . Besides , it stirs the blood , or at least mine , and is excellent for the body and the mind . And I , for one , find it both stimulating and quite enjoyable . " Clarissa raised a brow . " You sound precisely like Aunt Millicent . " " I 'm not the least bit surprised as I quite agree with her about a great many things . " Pamela handed her mask and foil to Monsieur Lucien , the fencing master , with a nod of thanks . " Of course you would . " Clarissa handed her own things to Monsieur Lucien . " Fencing , doing anything women do not typically do , makes you more of an  --  " " Do n't say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not in the mood for yet another discussion of my character flaws . " She started toward the grand entry in the ornate ballroom they had used for their fencing lesson . The ballroom occupied a good portion of the first floor of an impressive house in the very best part of Vienna that belonged to an Austrian count , an old and dear friend of Lady Smythe-Windom , their Aunt Millicent . Of course , there did n't seem to be anywhere in the world where there was n't a very old and very dear friend of Aunt Millicent 's . In all the years of their travel together , not one such friend of their aunt 's had ever failed to invite them to stay for as long as they wished . It was a grand way to live even if , on occasion , the unsettled nature of their lives had bothered both Pamela and Clarissa . Still , it was what each woman had chosen for her own reasons . " Nonetheless , I am going to say it . " Clarissa trailed after her cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconventional and a shade scandalous because it 's precisely what an Effington female would enjoy . " " I am an Effington female . " Pamela stifled a longsuffering sigh . Clarissa had brought this subject up over and over again in recent months and over and over again , Pamela had managed to deflect the discussion . She headed down the corridor that led to a series of salons designed for music and games and whatever else the residents of a house like this desired . " The flaw is n't in being what you are but rather in trying to be something you are n't , " Clarissa called after her . " Indeed , " Pamela muttered . It was easy for Clarissa to make pronouncements . She simply did n't understand and probably never would . Clarissa was Pamela 's cousin on her mother 's side and had n't the least idea what it was like to be an Effington . Especially a quiet , reserved , shy Effington . Oh , certainly , Pamela 's cousin Delia had been considered " quiet " until scandal broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassandra , who everyone thought was headed for the worst kind of scandal , well , was n't . And of course , there was Pamela herself , whose behavior no one had ever worried about , who , at the advanced age of twenty , when she certainly should have known better , had fallen deeply and passionately in love with George Fenton , the son of Viscount Penwick . At least she had thought she had , and had , with rapt abandon and no consideration to the consequences , lost her virtue to him . It was , as her brothers had muttered in a dark and forbidding manner once her ruination was known , the quiet ones you had to keep your eye on . It was n't simply her nature that had set Pamela apart from the vast numbers of Effington relations . She had never particularly looked like a member of the family , who were all in all an attractive lot , the women universally pretty , some of them quite beautiful , the men typically handsome and dashing .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
