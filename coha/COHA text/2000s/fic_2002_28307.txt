THE SENTRY March 5 , 1770 He had been in Boston for nearly eighteen months , had come ashore with the rest of His Majesty 's Twenty-ninth Regiment after a miserable journey down from Halifax . The troops had been summoned to the boats by their commander , General Thomas Gage , had been told only that they were going to the Massachusetts colony to maintain the peace . Few had any idea how that peace might be threatened , and nearly all saw the journey as an escape from the lonely isolation of the king 's most northern port . When they finally marched out of the cramped warships , they moved into a town where the people did not welcome them , did not provide homes or hospi- tality . Now , after nearly two years , the conflicts between the citizens of Boston and the soldiers had become more than the unpleasant argument , the occasional barroom brawl . The discipline of the troops had begun to slip ; men became frustrated by the hostility around them , the taunts and minor assaults , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers had begun to strike back . The citizens had responded to the anger of the troops with anger of their own , and gangs of young men armed with clubs and the occasional saber began to patrol the dark alleys outside the pubs and meeting places of the soldiers . The fights were more numerous now and were sometimes bloody . While the local magistrates were quick to arrest and prosecute , both sides protected their own , and no one had any illusion that the law could protect the innocent . Inspired by the newspapermen , who presented each incident in passionate detail , playing up the seething hostility , the citizens were more and more restless , fueling the growing anger toward the British troops . To many civilians , this military occupation was oppressive , and even those most loyal to the policies of London recognized that the presence of the troops was dangerous ; with the right spark , the minor disturbances could explode into a bloody disaster . His name was Hugh White , and he had served in the Twenty-ninth Regiment for nearly three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs on promotion , considered the corporal above him to be a far better soldier . He rarely spoke to the officers , was not a face or a name that anyone would ever single out . But today , he had been singled out , given a job that most in his company would dread . The duty was not for punishment of some indiscreet act . It was simply his turn . And so he stood guard in front of the Custom House , shivering against the sharp cold in a small wooden guardhouse , standing sentry to a place that would rarely attract attention . He moved around as much as the cramped space would allow , touched the walls on three sides of him , felt the rough cold wood . His fingers were numb , and he flexed them , then pushed one hand hard inside his coat . He glanced out beyond the guardhouse and saw only a few citizens moving quickly through the cold , ignoring him . He cast a glance down toward his hidden hand bulging in his coat , flexed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drill the week before , the sergeant scolding the men to keep their decorum , maintain their dignity , especially on guard duty . That meant hands by your side . He eased his head outside the guardhouse , looked toward the door- way of the Custom House , saw no one , felt relief . Perhaps even that old sergeant would understand , he thought . It 's just too cold . He put his other hand inside the rough wool , pulled his arms up tight . He blew out a sharp breath , thinking that if he stood up stiff the way they told him to , his fingers would probably fall off . The musket leaned up against the wall close beside him , a light glaze of frost on the black steel . The guardhouse was really only a narrow box , not much larger than an upright coffin . But it kept away the awful bite of the wind , the sharp cold that blew deep into your bones . Early that morning , the assignment of guard duty had made him smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had only thought of relieving the boredom of the barracks . Now he imagined what the others were doing , playing cards , the profane talk . His father had warned him of the bad influences , and he could still see his mother 's tear-stained face , watching as her boy marched away to join this army . She did n't want me to go , he thought . They expected me to work that land , he thought , still expect me to just come home and be a farmer , like them . They do n't know anything else . He remembered the look on their faces when he had come home , the brief visit before the Twenty-ninth had boarded the great ship to sail west . He had stood tall , waited as his father moved around him , inspecting the uniform , even touching the dull red coat , could still see his mother 's shock , her young boy now grown into this soldier . Their response had disappointed him . They had not seemed as proud as he had expected , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep himself clean , to avoid the awful deadly temptations that only a parent fears . I wish they could see me now , he thought . This is important , guarding the Custom House . He had n't even been inside the building , but he knew the rumors . There was supposed to be a huge vault filled with silver , the customs duties paid by the ships as they brought their goods into the port from England or from the islands far to the south . He hoped it was true , had no reason to doubt the importance of his duty , was proud of his responsibility , guarding the king 's currency . If those chaps back in the barracks knew how much this post means to the king , they would n't laugh , they 'd be out here , doing the duty . He glanced at the musket , then out again to the wide street , the hard-packed ice and snow , heard the stiff breeze whistling through the cracks in the crude wooden walls of the guardhouse . He wanted to drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding away the bandits with his bayonet , ordering the riffraff to move away , and his mind spoke out , the voice loud and firm , In the name of the king . . . He shivered now , and the image would not stay . He wriggled his fingers again , glanced toward the street once more . The locals did n't much care for them , he knew . He was n't educated in politics ; few of the private soldiers were . They had been surprised at the hostility from many of the citizens , and when they had marched away from the ships , they had been told that they would have to camp on Boston Common , since there were no open doors for them in private homes . But camping outdoors in tents could be deadly through the New England winter , and the commanders had struggled frantically to find accommodations . Finally , those in the town whom the officers called Tories and who did not seem so resentful of the troops began to open their doors , leasing buildings and warehouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two winters had passed , and the duty was mostly monotonous , painfully boring . He had spent much of his time simply standing at drill in the common , marching in formation , parading in line down the side streets . He stamped his cold feet and wondered why so many of these people hated the British so . All we do is march around . Many of the soldiers had begun to seek part-time work in the town , some spending their off-duty hours working jobs that would ease the boredom and provide a little more cash than their low army pay . But there was resentment for that as well , the citizens protesting that the troops were taking valuable jobs badly needed by the men of Boston . It was not long before the resentment turned violent . He had seen some of the fights , most inspired by strong drink , a sudden and accidental confrontation in an alley or outside a pub . But the violence had continued to grow , the fights larger , and men on both sides had seemed to organize just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both looking for some satisfaction , some way to relieve the constant hos- tility . He had seen the man with the bloody wound , three nights ago , the first real wound he had ever seen . He thought of the man-John Rodgers , another young private-his skull split open . The anger in the barracks had brought the officers in , stern words , threats of punishment . But even the soldiers who had not been a part of the fights knew that there would be more violence . He had endured the insults himself , knew better than to walk the streets alone , even off duty , out of uniform . He still did n't understand the anger . We 're just keeping the peace . He said the words again in his mind , the first orders he had heard , even before they left the ship . Keep the peace . He moved his legs , stepped in place , tried to relieve the numbness in his feet . He leaned out past the protection of the guardhouse , felt a stiff breeze on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . Too cold for the officers , that 's certain . They 're all inside , probably eating their hot food . He could see the main guard building , and down the street the headquarters for His Majesty 's forces . He felt a rumble in his stomach , began to think of the supper that waited for him back in the barracks . He could use a cup of tea right now . He tried to imagine the steam rolling up on his face , but the wind suddenly blew hard against the guardhouse , and now he could hear something else , voices , shouts . He leaned outside again , saw a group of men moving in the street , turning toward the Custom House . He watched them , counted maybe a dozen , then saw more men coming around a corner a block down the street . He had been warned about the gangs , all the troops understanding that they were targets for the bands of rough young men . He shivered again , made two tight fists inside his coat , watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Custom House . Now the voices were clear , and he saw one man point at him , felt his heart jump in his chest . They began to move straight toward the guardhouse , straight toward him . He pulled his hands from his coat , reached down , gripped the musket , leaned it up on his shoulder . Make a good show , he thought . No one will get past . They will not dare . He watched them move closer , realized they were young , teens perhaps , saw one bend down , scooping up the snow , rolling an icy ball in his hands . There were more shouts , and suddenly the boy threw the snowball at the guardhouse . White flinched , heard the dull smack against the wall , felt his heart pounding , said aloud , " Move along now . This is no place for play . " The faces were all looking at him , and he expected to see smiles , the playfulness of boys , but there was something new , unexpected , anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved closer , their aim more true , and he felt a splatter of snow against his chest . The laughter came , but they did not move away , the fun was not over . White stepped outside the cover of the guardhouse , felt his own anger rising , looked at the faces , the voices jeering , calling out to him . One boy suddenly lunged closer , and White watched his hands , expecting something , another snowball , but the boy said , " What kind of man are you ? A filthy lobster-back ! " White tried to ignore the boy , glanced again at the door of the Custom House , saw the door open slightly , faces peering out , the door closing again . White began to move toward the steps at the doorway , but the boy jumped in front of him , close , reached out and grabbed at the uniform , began to shout , " Dirty lobster-back , " and White swung the musket around , the butt striking the boy 's face . The boy fell backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mob as White stared at the boy . My God , stop this . He moved up the steps of the Custom House , close to the doorway , saw the young faces watching him , could see out past the mob now , more men coming forward , older men , some in suits , staying back , watching . He felt his hands shaking , tried to grip the musket , shouted , " Leave this place ! Move away ! " The injured boy was crying , shrieking , " You dirty scoundrel ! I 'll see you dead ! " The voices began to answer , more curses , the boys moving closer again . The snowballs resumed , hitting the door of the Custom House , and suddenly something dark flew past his head , a thick piece of wood , making a sharp cracking sound against the wooden door behind him . He shouted again , " Back ! Stay back ! " He could feel his hands shaking , the icy numbness giving way to a rising wave of fear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer 's words suddenly came to him again : Keep the peace . He clamped the musket under one arm , his hands still shaking , reached inside the cartridge box at his waist . He felt the stiff paper with his numb fingers , fought through the pounding in his chest , the training taking hold , the fear giving way to the deliberate motion . He tore at the tip of the paper cartridge , poured powder into the pan at the breech , clamped down the lock . He set the butt of the musket down on the step , slowly slid the cartridge into the barrel of the musket , prodded it down the long barrel with the ramrod . Now he pulled out the bayonet , slid it hard on the barrel , a sharp twist , and lowered the barrel , pointed it out toward the crowd . His heart was racing , and he felt a surge of strength , the fear growing into raw excitement . He expected to see the fear in their faces , the respect for the soldier with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the voices were louder still , and now another stick struck the door behind him . He could see more sticks , the crowd moving slowly forward , one voice shouting , " Shoot us ! Go ahead , shoot us ! You coward ! Shoot us and be damned ! " He gripped the musket hard , still felt his hands trembling violently , the cold now deep in his chest . He wanted to say something , anything , to move them away . At that moment , he saw a man moving up to one side , well dressed , a familiar face , and the man said , " Soldier , easy now . Do you mean to shoot ? " " I will fire . . . if they assault me ! " The man came up the steps , said , " Easy , young man . Take care . There need be no killing here . " White glanced at the man 's calm face . White nodded , felt a wave of relief , felt suddenly protected , heard a second voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Move away ! Do n't molest this sentry ! There is no fight here ! " The mob began to quiet , some of the boys backing away , the curses now slowing . He took a deep breath , thought , Yes , move away . Let this end . Thank God . Then there was a new sound , from a church tower , the sudden tolling of a bell echoing through the streets . Another bell began , farther away . The faces began to turn away , looking toward the sound , the fire bell . The voices began again , but the sounds were different . Far down the street , more men began to emerge , and he could hear shouting , one word flowing from place to place : " Fire ! " The sounds grew close , men suddenly moving out from a side street behind the Custom House , the word echoing all through the crowd , " Fire ! " Now the crowd pushed toward the Custom House , some moving toward him , some lining up on the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , the faces turning toward him , and the curses rose once more : " Dirty scoundrel ! Lobster-back ! " He felt the fear coming back , the icy grip in his chest . He could hear sounds above him , men at the windows ; he wanted to shout at them , but there were no words . His face still watched the crowd , and now the sticks were raised again , the snow and ice striking the walls around him , a sharp stab suddenly in his chest , the heavy stick punching him . He looked out over the heads of the men closest to him , could see the main guard building , fought the fear , suddenly shouted , " Turn out the guard ! Turn out the guard ! " The people nearest to him began to move up the short steps , one man reaching out , grabbing at the musket . White jerked the gun to one side , swept the tip of the bayonet back and forth , forcing the men back . One boy shouted close to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back hard against the door , still waving the bayonet toward the crowd , and said , " Damn you ! I will shoot ! " At that instant , there were new sounds , and he turned , saw a line of red emerging through the crowd , saw the tips of bayonets . The man who led the soldiers held a sword high , the coat brighter red , the man 's chest crossed with bright yellow , the uniform of an officer , a familiar face . White said , " Sir ! Captain Preston ! Sir . . . " He wanted to say more , to thank the officer , felt the sudden flood of relief . The crowd seemed to pull away , the mass of men and boys watching as the soldiers repeated what White had done , loading their muskets . Preston moved up onto the steps , said , " It 's all right , Private . Fall in . Take position with the troops . " White stepped quickly toward the line of soldiers , saw eight men , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim-faced . White moved among them , and the soldiers turned in quick rhythm , muskets held waist high , pointing toward the crowd . White stood between two of the men , felt their strength , their power . The fear was gone , the excitement filling him , and he thought , Now we will see . Now this mob will know . He felt the snowball hit his stomach , and at once the sticks were flying again , the shouts coming as before . Behind the mob , more men were pressing forward , some still shouting , " Fire ! " Beyond , the bells still called to the town , the pealing growing louder , the sounds echoing , blending with the shouts of the mob . Captain Preston stepped out in front of the soldiers , glanced at White , then out at the crowd , said aloud , " We will march away from here ! You will let us pass ! " There was a chorus of new voices , one man in front shouting , " Or you will shoot us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell ! " Preston looked back at the soldiers , waved his hand toward the wall of the Custom House , said , " Form here . Flanks anchored against the wall ! " The men moved back , White following the flow . Those on each end of the line positioned themselves close to the front wall of the Custom House , the others facing out in a short semicircle . Now Preston paced slowly in front of the troops , said to the crowd , " You will disperse ! In the name of King George , I order you to return to your homes ! " White stood behind Preston , heard muttered curses from the soldiers on either side of him , their own anger building . Preston turned , said in a low voice , " None of that ! We will move these people away ! Do your duty ! " The crowd began to surge forward again , hands began to reach for the muskets . Preston shouted again , " Disperse ! " There were answers now , many voices , snowballs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bright brass of a saber . Suddenly a man lunged forward at the troops , grabbed one musket by the barrel , tried to pull it away from the soldier , who wrestled with his attacker . Another man stepped close , struck out at a bayonet with a long stick , knocking the musket from the soldier 's hands . More men surged forward , tried to grab the musket , the soldier now on the ground , fists striking back . White fought the urge to help the soldier , held his musket straight toward the crowd , watched the faces , heard the voices louder still , the words flowing over the troops , the calls to fire , the screams of the mob , men powered by anger , hostility boiling into raw hatred , the sounds of the bells bursting in his ears , and now White looked to the side , saw the fallen soldier on his knees , pushing a man back , picking up the musket , screaming something White did not understand , a raw animal sound , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt his heart leap , saw a man in the crowd go down , heard something from Preston , words , one word , " No . . . " Quickly there came more shots , the soldiers losing all control , the fear and the anger giving way . White felt the growing horror , but then the crowd was there , close in front , the screams and curses , the violence flowing over all of them . He saw someone holding a thick piece of wood , waving it over his head , the man still moving forward , and White raised the musket to his shoulder , fought through the roar of sound in his ears , the church bells , the muskets now blasting smoke and fire on either side of him , the sounds of terror from the crowd . He gripped the musket hard , held it tight to his shoulders , the fear in his heart giving way to the madness now washing over them all . The man stalked toward him , brandishing the stick as some deadly club , shouting words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the man stopped , stared at the muzzle of the musket , seemed suddenly calm , looked at White 's face , deep into his eyes , and the sounds gave way to the man 's words , soft through the chiming of the church bells . White could not hold back , the terror and the anger too strong , and as he pulled the trigger , he heard the man say , " You can not kill us all . . . . "
