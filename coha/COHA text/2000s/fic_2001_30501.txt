I HAVE TO . I 've been fighting it all night . I 'm going to lose . My battle is as futile as a woman feeling the first pangs of labor and deciding it 's an inconvenient time to give birth . Nature wins out . It always does . It 's nearly two a.m. , too late for this foolishness and I need my sleep . Four nights spent cramming to meet a deadline have left me exhausted . It does n't matter . Patches of skin behind my knees and elbows have been tingling and now begin to burn . My heart beats so fast I have to gulp air . I clench my eyes shut , willing the sensations to stop but they do n't . Philip is sleeping beside me . He 's another reason why I should n't leave , sneaking out in the middle of the night again and returning with a torrent of lame excuses . He 's working late tomorrow . If I can just wait one more day . My temples begin to throb . The burning sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rage forms a tight ball in my gut and threatens to explode . I 've got to get out of here-I do n't have a lot of time left . Philip does n't stir when I slip from the bed . There 's a pile of clothing tucked underneath my dresser so I wo n't risk the squeaks and groans of opening drawers and closets . I pick up my keys , clasping my fist around them so they do n't jangle , ease open the door , and creep into the hallway . Everything 's quiet . The lights seem dimmed , as if overpowered by the emptiness . When I push the elevator button , it creaks out a complaint at being disturbed at so ungodly an hour . The first floor and lobby are equally empty . People who can afford the rent this close to downtown Toronto are comfortably asleep by this time . My legs itch as well as hurtand I curl my toes to see if the itching stops . It does n't . I look down at the car keys in my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place-the itching has crystallized into a sharp burn . Keys in my pocket , I stride onto the streets , looking for a quiet place to Change . As I walk , I monitor the sensation in my legs , tracing its passage to my arms and the back of my neck . Soon . Soon . When my scalp starts to tingle , I know I have walked as far as I can so I search for an alley . The first one I find has been claimed by two men squeezed together inside a tattered big-screen TV box . The next alley is empty . I hurry to the end and undress quickly behind a barricade of trash bins , hide the clothes under an old newspaper . Then I start the Change . My skin stretches . The sensation deepens and I try to block the pain . Pain . What a trivial word-agony is better . One does n't call the sensation of being flayed alive " painful . " I inhale deeply and focus my attention on the Change , dropping to the ground before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy-perhaps I 'm still too human . In the struggle to keep my thoughts straight , I try to anticipate each phase and move my body into position-head down , on all fours , arms and legs straight , feet and hands flexed , and back arched . My leg muscles knot and convulse . I gasp and strain to relax . Sweat breaks out , pouring off me in streams , but the muscles finally relent and untwist themselves . Next comes the ten seconds of hell that used to make me swear I 'd rather die than endure this again . Then it 's over . Changed . I stretch and blink . When I look around , the world has mutated to an array of colors unknown to the human eye , blacks and browns and grays with subtle shadings that my brain still converts to blues and greens and reds . I lift my nose and inhale . With the Change , my already keen senses sharpen even more . I pick up scents of fresh asphalt and rotting tomatoes and window-pot mums and day-old sweat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so overwhelming I cough and shake my head . As I turn , I catch distorted fragments of my reflection in a dented trash can . My eyes stare back at me . I curl my lips back and snarl at myself . White fangs flash in the metal . I am a wolf , a 130-pound wolf with pale blond fur . The only part of me that remains are my eyes , sparking with a cold intelligence and a simmering ferocity that could never be mistaken for anything but human . I look around , inhaling the scents of the city again . I 'm nervous here . It 's too close , too confined ; it reeks of human spoor . I must be careful . If I 'm seen , I 'll be mistaken for a dog , a large mixed breed , perhaps a husky and yellow Labrador mix . But even a dog my size is cause for alarm when it 's running loose . I head for the back of the laneway and seek a path through the underbelly of the city . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form but by the unnaturalness of my surroundings . I ca n't get my bearings and the first alley I go down turns out to be the one I 'd encountered in human form , the one with the two men in the faded Sony box . One of them is awake now . He 's tugging the remnants of a filth-encrusted blanket between his fingers as if he can stretch it large enough to cover himself against the cold October night . He looks up and sees me . His eyes widen . He starts to shrink back , then stops himself . He says something . His voice is crooning , the musical , exaggerated tones people use with infants and animals . If I concentrated , I could make out the words , but there 's no point . I know what he 's saying , some variation of " nice doggy , " repeated over and over in a variety of inflections . His hands are outstretched , palms out to ward me off , the physical language contradicting the vocal . Stay back-nice doggy-stay back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can smell the neglect and waste rising from his body . It smells like weakness , like an aged deer driven to the fringe of the herd , prime pickings for predators . If I were hungry , he 'd smell like dinner . Fortunately , I 'm not hungry yet , so I do n't have to deal with the temptation , the conflict , the revulsion . I snort , condensation trumpeting from my nostrils , then turn and lope back up the alley . Ahead is a Vietnamese restaurant . The smell of food is embedded in the very wood frame of the building . On a rear addition , an exhaust fan turns slowly , clicking with each revolution as one blade catches the metal screen casing . Below the fan a window is open . Faded sunflower-print curtains billow out in the night breeze . I can hear people inside , a room full of people , grunting and whistling in sleep . I want to see them . I want to stick my muzzle in the open window and look inside . A werewolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprotected people . I start to creep forward but a sudden crackle and hiss stops me . The hiss softens , then is drowned out by a man 's voice , sharp , his words snapped off like icicles . I turn my head each way , radar searching for the source . He 's farther down the street . I abandon the restaurant and go to him . We are curious by nature . He 's standing in a three-car parking lot wedged at the end of a narrow passage between buildings . He holds a walkie-talkie to his ear and leans one elbow against a brick wall , casual but not resting . His shoulders are relaxed . His gaze goes nowhere . He is confident in his place , that he has a right to be here and little to fear from the night . The gun dangling from his belt probably helps . He stops talking , jabs a button , and slams the walkie-talkie into its holster . His eyes scan the parking lot once , taking inventory and seeing nothing requiring his attention . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be amusing . I follow . My nails click against the pavement . He does n't notice . I pick up speed , darting around trash bags and empty boxes . Finally , I 'm close enough . He hears the steady clicking behind him and stops . I duck behind a Dumpster , peer around the corner . He turns and squints into the darkness . After a second he starts forward . I let him get a few steps away , then resume the pursuit . This time when he stops , I wait one extra second before diving for cover . He lets out a muffled oath . He 's seen something-a flash of motion , a shadow flickering , something . His right hand slips to his gun , caressing the metal , then pulling back , as if the reassurance is enough . He hesitates , then looks up and down the alley , realizing he is alone and uncertain what to do about it . He mutters something , then continues walking , quicker this time . As he walks , his eyes flick from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I inhale deeply , picking up only wisps of fear , enough to make my heart pound , but not enough to send my brain spinning out of control . He 's safe quarry for a stalking game . He wo n't run . I can suppress most of my instincts . I can stalk him without killing him . I can suffer the first pangs of hunger without killing him . I can watch him pull his gun without killing him . Yet if he runs , I wo n't be able to stop myself . That 's a temptation I ca n't fight . If he runs , I will chase . If I chase , either he 'll kill me or I 'll kill him . As he turns the corner down a connecting alley , he relaxes . All has been silent behind him . I creep from my hiding place , shifting my weight to the back of my foot pads to muffle the sound of my nails . Soon I am only a few feet behind him . I can smell his aftershave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . I can see his white socks appearing and disappearing between his shoes and pant legs . I can hear his breathing , the slight elevation in tempo betraying the fact that he 's walking faster than usual . I ease forward , coming close enough that I could lunge if I want to and knock him to the ground before he even thought to reach for his gun . His head jerks up . He knows I 'm there . He knows something is there . I wonder if he will turn . Does he dare to look , to face something he ca n't see or hear , but can only sense ? His hand slides to his gun , but he does n't turn . He walks faster . Then he swings back to the safety of the street . I follow him to the end and observe from the darkness . He strides forward , keys in hand , to a parked cruiser , unlocks it , and hops inside . The car roars and squeals from the curb . I watch the receding taillights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice but it was n't nearly enough to satisfy me . These city backstreets are too confining . My heart is thudding with unspent excitement . My legs are aching with built-up energy . I must run . A wind gusts from the south , bringing the sharp tang of Lake Ontario with it . I think of heading to the beach , imagine running along the stretch of sand , feeling the icy water slapping against my paws , but it 's not safe . If I want to run , I must go to the ravine . It 's a long way , but I have little choice unless I plan to skulk around human-smelling alleyways for the rest of the night . I swing to the northwest and begin the journey . Nearly a half hour later , I 'm standing at the crest of a hill . My nose twitches , picking up the vestiges of an illegal leaf fire smoldering in a nearby yard . The wind bristles through my fur , chill , nearly cold , invigorating . Above me , traffic thunders across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the city . I leap forward , throwing myself off . At last I 'm running . My legs pick up the rhythm before I 'm halfway down the ravine . I close my eyes for a second and feel the wind slice across my muzzle . As my paws thump against the hard earth , tiny darts of pain shoot up my legs , but they make me feel alive , like jolting awake after an overlong sleep . The muscles contract and extend in perfect harmony . With each stretch comes an ache and a burst of physical joy . My body is thanking me for the exercise , rewarding me with jolts of near-narcotic adrenaline . The more I run , the lighter I feel , the pain falling free as if my paws are no longer striking the ground . Even as I race along the bottom of the ravine , I feel like I 'm still running downhill , gaining energy instead of expending it . I want to run until all the tension in my body flies away , leaving nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I wanted to . And I do n't want to . Dead leaves crackle under my paws . Somewhere in the forest an owl hoots softly . It has finished its hunting and rests contented , not caring who knows it 's around . A rabbit bolts out of a thicket and halfway across my path , then realizes its mistake and zooms back into the undergrowth . I keep running . My heart pounds . Against my rising body heat , the air feels ice-cold , stinging as it storms through my nostrils and into my lungs . I inhale , savoring the shock of it hitting my insides . I 'm running too fast to smell anything . Bits of scents flutter through my brain in a jumbled montage that smells of freedom . Unable to resist , I finally skid to a halt , throw my head back , and howl . The music pours up from my chest in a tangible evocation of pure joy . It echoes through the ravine and soars to the moonless sky , letting them all know I 'm here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drop my head , panting with exertion . I 'm standing there , staring down into a scattering of yellow and red maple leaves , when a sound pierces my self-absorption . It 's a growl , a soft , menacing growl . There 's a pretender to my throne . I look up to see a brownish yellow dog standing a few meters away . No , not a dog . My brain takes a second , but it finally recognizes the animal . A coyote . The recognition takes a second because it 's unexpected . I 've heard there are coyotes in the city , but have never encountered one . The coyote is equally confused . Animals do n't know what to make of me . They smell human , but see wolf and , just when they decide their nose is tricking them , they look into my eyes and see human . When I encounter dogs , they either attack or turn tail and run . The coyote does neither . It lifts its muzzle and sniffs the air , then bristles and pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half my size , scarcely worth my notice . I let it know this with a lazy " get lost " growl and a shake of my head . The coyote does n't move . I stare at it . The coyote breaks the gaze-lock first . I snort , toss my head again , and slowly turn away . I 'm halfway turned when a flash of brown fur leaps at my shoulder . Diving to the side , I roll out of the way , then scramble to my feet . The coyote snarls . I give a serious growl , a canine " now you 're pissing me off . " The coyote stands its ground . It wants a fight . Good . My fur rises on end , my tail bushing out behind me . I lower my head between my shoulder bones and lay my ears flat . My lips pull back and I feel the snarl tickling up through my throat then reverberating into the night . The coyote does n't back down . I crouch and I 'm about to lunge when something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . I stumble , then twist to face my attacker . A second coyote , gray-brown , hangs from my shoulder , fangs sunk to the bone . With a roar of rage and pain , I buck up and throw my weight to the side . As the second coyote flies free , the first launches itself at my face . Ducking my head , I catch it in the throat , but my teeth clamp down on fur instead of flesh and it squirms away . It tries to back off for a second lunge , but I leap at it , backing it into a tree . It rears up , trying to get out of my way . I slash for its throat . This time I get my grip . Blood spurts in my mouth , salty and thick . The coyote 's mate lands on my back . My legs buckle . Teeth sink into the loose skin beneath my skull . Fresh pain arcs through me . Concentrating hard , I keep my grip on the first coyote 's throat . I steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just long enough to make the fatal slash and tear . As I pull back , blood sprays into my eyes , blinding me . I swing my head hard , ripping out the coyote 's throat . Once I feel it go limp , I toss it aside , then throw myself on the ground and roll over . The coyote on my back yips in surprise and releases its hold . I jump up and turn in the same motion , ready to take this other animal out of the game , but it scrambles up and dives into the brush . With a flash of wire-brush tail , it 's gone . I look at the dead coyote . Blood streams from its throat , eagerly lapped up by the dry earth below . A tremor runs through me , like the final shudder of sated lust . I close my eyes and shiver . Not my fault . They attacked me first . The ravine has gone quiet , echoing the calm that floods through me . Not so much as a cricket chirps . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine and clean my wounds , but they are out of reach . I stretch and assess the pain . Two deep cuts , both bleeding only enough to mat my fur . I 'll live . I turn and start the trip out of the ravine . In the alley I Change then yank my clothes on and scurry to the sidewalk like a junkie caught shooting up in the shadows . Frustration fills me . It should n't end like this , dirty and furtive , amidst the garbage and filth of the city . It should end in a clearing in the forest , clothes abandoned in some thicket , stretched out naked , feeling the coolness of the earth beneath me and the night breeze tickling my bare skin . I should be falling asleep in the grass , exhausted beyond all thought , with only the miasma of contentedness floating through my mind . And I should n't be alone . In my mind , I can see the others , lying around me in the grass . I can hear the familiar snores , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against mine , a bare foot hooked over my calf , twitching in a dream of running . I can smell them : their sweat , their breath , mingling with the scent of blood , smears from a deer killed in the chase . The image shatters and I am staring into a shopwindow , seeing nothing but myself reflected back . My chest tightens in a loneliness so deep and so complete I ca n't breathe . I turn quickly and lash out at the nearest object . A streetlamp quavers and rings with the blow . Pain sears down my arm . Welcome to reality-changing in alleyways and creeping back to my apartment . I am cursed to live between worlds . On the one side there is normalcy . On the other , there is a place where I can be what I am with no fear of reprisals , where I can commit murder itself and scarcely raise the eyebrows of those around me , where I am even encouraged to do so to protect the sanctity of that world . But I left and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walk to the apartment , my anger blisters the pavement with every step . A woman curled up under a pile of dirty blankets peers out as I pass and instinctively shrinks back into her nest . As I round the corner , two men step out and size up my prospects as prey . I resist the urge to snarl at them , but just barely . I walk faster and they seem to decide I 'm not worth chasing . I should n't be here . I should be home in bed , not prowling downtown Toronto at four a.m . A normal woman would n't be here . It 's yet another reminder that I 'm not normal . Not normal . I look down the darkened street and I can read a billet on a telephone post fifty feet off . Not normal . I catch a whiff of fresh bread from a bakery starting production miles away . Not normal . I stop by a storefront , grab a bar over the windows , and flex my biceps . The metal groans in my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words in my head , flagellating myself with them . The anger only grows . Outside my apartment door , I stop and inhale deeply . I must n't wake Philip . And if I do , I must n't let him see me like this . I do n't need a mirror to know what I look like : skin taut , color high , eyes incandescent with the rage that always seems to follow a Change now . Definitely not normal . When I finally enter the apartment , I hear his measured breathing from the bedroom . Still asleep . I 'm nearly to the bathroom when his breathing catches . " Elena ? " His voice is a sleep-stuffed croak . " Just going to the washroom . " I try to slip past the doorway , but he 's sitting up , peering nearsightedly at me . He frowns . " Fully dressed ? " he says . " I went out . " A moment of silence . He runs a hand through his dark hair and sighs . " It 's not safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wake me up and I 'll go with you . " " I need to be alone . To think . " " It 's not safe . " " I know . I 'm sorry . " I creep into the bathroom , spending longer than necessary . I pretend to use the toilet , wash my hands with enough water to fill a Jacuzzi , then find a fingernail that needs elaborate filing attention . When I finally decide Philip has fallen back asleep , I head for the bedroom . The bedside lamp is on . He 's propped on his pillow , glasses in place . I hesitate in the doorway . I ca n't bring myself to cross the threshold , to go and crawl into bed with him . I hate myself for it , but I ca n't do it . The memory of the night lingers and I feel out of place here . When I do n't move , Philip shifts his legs over the side of the bed and sits up . " I did n't mean to snap , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need your freedom and I 'm trying- " He stops and rubs his hand across his mouth . His words slice through me . I know he does n't mean them as a reprimand , but they are a reminder that I 'm screwing this up , that I 'm fortunate to have found someone as patient and understanding as Philip , but I 'm wearing through that patience at breakneck speed and all I seem capable of doing is standing back and waiting for the final crash . " I know you need your freedom , " he says again . " But there has to be some other way . Maybe you could go out in the morning , early . If you prefer night , we could drive down to the lake . You could walk around . I could sit in the car and keep an eye on you . Maybe I could walk with you . Stay twenty paces behind or something . " He manages a wry smile . " Or maybe not . I 'd probably get picked up by the cops , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pauses , then leans forward . " That 's your cue , Elena . You 're supposed to remind me that forty-one is far from middle-aged . " " We 'll work something out , " I say . We ca n't , of course . I have to run under the cover of night and I have to do it alone . There is no compromise . As he sits on the edge of the bed , watching me , I know we 're doomed . My only hope is to make this relationship so otherwise perfect that Philip might come to overlook our one insurmountable problem . To do that , my first step should be to go to him , crawl in bed , kiss him and tell him I love him . But I ca n't . Not tonight . Tonight I 'm something else , something he does n't know and could n't understand . I do n't want to go to him like this . " I 'm not tired , " I say . " I might as well stay up . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his expression falters and I know I 've failed-again . But he does n't say anything . He pulls his smile back in place . " Let 's go out . Someplace in this city has to be open this early . We 'll drive around until we find it . Drink five cups of coffee and watch the sun come up . Okay ? " I nod , not trusting myself to speak . " Shower first ? " he says . " Or flip for it ? " " You go ahead . " He kisses my cheek as he passes . I wait until I hear the shower running , then head for the kitchen . Sometimes I get so hungry .
