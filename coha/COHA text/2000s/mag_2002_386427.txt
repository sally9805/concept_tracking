James Carter , 76 , of Chicago ( shown here with a platinum copy of the O Brother , Where Art Thou ? album ) was a Mississippi prisoner in 1959 when he was recorded by a musicologist singing Po , Lazarus . The song became part of a movie soundtrack that won a Grammy for Record of the Year and earned Carter $20,000. // Seventy-six-year-old James Carter is a man with a record who 's paid his debt to society . Now society is paying him back . In 1959 he sang Po ' Lazarus ( a bluesy foreboding song about a cruel man locked in a deadly struggle with a tough sheriff ) as he worked on a chain gang at the Mississippi State Penitentiary while he served time for a theft charge . During that stretch Alan Lomax , then a young musicologist with an interest in Black folk music , recorded Carter . And it was from that chance encounter , 42 years ago , that allowed Carter 's song to be the first recording heard on the 0 Brother , Where Art Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win a Grammy as record of the year . This ultimately earned the aging grandfather and son of a sharecropper a platinum copy of the 0 Brother soundtrack , a royalty check for $20,000 ( with possibly much more to come , now that the album has sold over 5 million copies ) and a trip to Los Angeles . " This feels great , " said Carter , sitting in his far West Side Chicago apartment dressed in a crisp tan suit and charcoal gray fedora , as sunlight and shadows pour through his living room window to play over his smiling , weathered face . " It 's been the best time of my life . " " The trip to L.A. was wonderful . I had more fim there than I had in a while . My wife and my daughters were there with me , " he stated as he pointed to his relatives . " I had the whole family there . Everything went real nice . California is a great state . " However , it was a trip that almost did n't happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we were reached on the phone by the people at the Lomax Archives , my wife Rosie Lee Carter got the call and she analyzed it .. and determined the call to be truthful , " he said . Scott adds : " They contacted my mother a longtime minister of the Holy Temple Church of God through the church . They initially tried to catch up with my father after the movie came out and they started selling a lot of the CDs , " she said . " But our number is unpublished and there are a lot of James Carters in Chicago , because it 's such a common name . " Once they contacted us , they wanted my father to identify the other people in some of the prison pictures . They wanted to make sure it was actually him . Then they left some paperwork that we had-looked over by an attorney .

I guess he just figured that it would make the work go by much better . " // Me people at the archives thought it was a miracle that my father was still alive ... It 's extraordinary . " Apparently they had been trying to reach Carter for years after his release from prison , but the search to find him to pay Carter his singing royalties really intensified after the movie soundtrack began to top the charts . Photograph Carter , who in 1959 worked on a chain gang at a Mississippi penitentiary , says he sang Po ' Lazarus because it helped " make the work easier and ... it helped make a bad situation a little more bearable . " // " I still was n't intending to go to the Grammys but my daughter convinced me . So , I just caved in and went on , " he said , shrugging his shoulders . Scott explained that her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trepidation about flying . " It was their first plane flight . So , it was basically two miracles in a row the trip and the Grammy win . I just encouraged them to go because it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience , because most of us never get these kinds of opportunities . I just told them this is something you do n't want to pass up . " Carter added : " We had a nice time going and coming . No troubles at all . They put us up in a nice hotel . Everything was paid for . " Listening to the haunting song-accentuated only by the sound of chopping axes keeping rhythm-warrants imagining Mississippi prisoners working in the sweltering Southern heat . It makes you feel that you 're listening to history , a form of music that may never be heard again . Carter says he learned the work song in the penitentiary . " You sang the song to help make the work easier and elevate the spirit . It helped make a bad situation a little more bearable . " Rosie Lee , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always did a little singing around the house . " I guess he just figured that it would make the work go by much better . " And she admits that the sequence of events that seem to be leading their family to financial independence is beyond her understanding . " This is all just a mystery . But the Lord has blessed us , so we must be doing something right . Just keep on doing good , and it 'll come back to you . "  --  SCOTTY BALLARD <p>
