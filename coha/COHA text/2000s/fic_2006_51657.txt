I GET INTO MY SEAT PRETTY EARLY and look at my book here and there but mostly feel edgy to see if I 'll luck out and keep my elbow room , the plane filling up and my heart beating in its cozy pocket with the suspense as seats are claimed but not next to me yet . A man hunches in the aisle , leaning his forehead on his fists on the overhead compartment , paunchy and affable . His kids are up there and he 's back here . I express my sorrow . Blowers blow in my face and when I reach up to knock one sideways and twist its little doohickeys , the guy straightens up but that 's all , and I surmise he 's supposed to cross me and sit but he does n't , shrugging a lot and not situating his stuff . A young guy , at this point , with a compact build like a wrestler ( regular wrestler , not costume wrestler ) comes over with his shirt tucked in and a baseball cap . He takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's here to swap seats . <p> " My hero ! " says the man , which makes me look at him sarcastically , squinty , like you 've got to be kidding , because it 's , shall we say , odd to hear a big guy call a younger guy a hero when it 's not as if it 's a child on the local news who told his mother about his brother flailing in the pool and this is the reporter explaining about small packages , and it 's not as if this affable man is a princess in a tower with a cone on his head . He looks at me in a way that is distinctly pissed off . <p> Let me see if I can think of when that look occurs that he gave me : We are at a dinner party and I am his wife and maybe a week before the party we had a fight but I figure it 's in the past , or I 'm hoping it 's in the past but I 'm not sure , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking pans " ( supposing his name is Hal ) , which is also a reference to the fight but no one in the room would know that , or if they did know it was about the fight it would just be me affirming our togetherness anyway because everyone has fights , it 's a sign of a healthy relationship , so when I make the carefully innocuous remark it 's sort of me giving him the chance to publicly get over it without making an announcement , and this elicits the look from him that I 'm talking about right now with the plane . <p> What I mean is it 's an intimate kind of anger he 's looking at me with , that I should know him , and know better , and I am not taking care of my end of things . That I am not pulling my weight in this community . <p> They slap shoulders symmetrically , the two guys , big pudgy affable and tight squat hero , holding their canyons in their left hands . They shift sideways and turnstile around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokes of a Ferris wheel in the air or whatever you call it , it being the exact space between everyone and the ceiling , the corridor between overhead compartments . They are like gears in the plane . It 's as if the plane needs them to do what it is preparing to do . Like they say , We need everyone to take their seats . We need everyone to look at the lighted signs . We need everyone to pass their cups to the flight attendant , remember about the seat belts and masks , push the button when you need something . <p> Everyone is bits of their clothing or hair from where I sit . It 's where artists got the idea for collage , I think , sitting in a crowd with a slot of available vision . There 's only so much that can happen on a plane . Kids kicking the seat , babies screaming or being about to scream . The mile-high club . Do you or do n't you have a comic pilot . Actually , now that I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anything can happen , just like anywhere else , it just usually does n't , but this time I 'm here to tell the tale . Not to jack anything up here , but every airplane story has got to be about crashing or , I swear to god , why bother ? <p> Stubby yet handsome younger guy slips in . Slipping in is never graceful on a plane , but I tuck my knees to my chest like we 're already going down and he squeegees by , pooching his butt over and across the middle seat with happy little comradery noises and then , with an expressive exhale of self-satisfaction that means I can ask him anything now , he plops into the window seat and is mine for the duration . He puts his cap back on and adjusts it . The cap says MARINES . Of course he 's a marine , clearly he is-if plainclothes , if a tad squat-and I knew it . <p> There are ways to ensure almost anyone will not talk to you . It 's easy especially on planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : someplace to put your eyes . Any contained space has a protocol that is soothing , the Spanish fans of its social dance . This is why it will be a certain kind of relief , if terrifying , when everyone in the world either speaks English or shuts up for good . I consider cementing my eyes to my book . Three times I read this phrase : " It is not so much a matter of humanism , " and then I move on to the next one . Guy takes his baseball cap off again and holds it in his lap , rubs his head , which is clipped but not severely , and then folds it and stuffs it in with the magazines behind the elastic so the bill sticks out . The fabric on this plane is blue on blue , light blue with check marks of darker blue that make a pattern like scales . <p> Things are settling into the thick hum that will coat everything for who knows how long-until I shower , usually . There 's the safety show , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than consciously . Then , as the engines gun , as their pitch swirls higher and into the ends of human aural perception , I lean to look up the aisle . The seats and the centermost slivers of peoples bodies replicate as if by drunken vision , a movie projected out of focus , the seats with their aisle arms and the arms of people bulging into view like shadows and receding along this most primitive diagram of three dimensions , the blue aisle slithering beneath the curtain to first class and disappearing , its imaginary head presumably plunked down in the cockpit , grinning , all fanged , out the front window like a kid leaning up between its parents , pilot , copilot . One of them pats it on the head . <p> A few rows up from me an arm comes loose from its regimen and flicks a coin . I 'm lucky to catch this . I think I am the only one . I see no other heads in the aisle . I think the person with the arm did it secretly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons at the cuff and it 's far enough away that I ca n't tell if it 's a man arm or a woman arm , and I have no clue what precise color the hand is so I also have no clue about anything like the race or the age of the arm . It 's a generic arm . It 's Everyarm . It tosses a coin into the aisle and I think about it for a moment and then it comes to me like a transmission : This person has also been looking at the aisle , but the person has not seen a blue dragon ; the person has seen a blue river and has tossed a coin in , for luck . <p> The hero beside me is trying to get something out from between his teeth by sucking and using his tongue . He 's also using the seat between us for his jacket . I give my book another shot and it says , " Past belief because beyond knowing , " and I think about luck and how if the coin works everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's such a thing as one survivor from a 737 , and if being a sole survivor could possibly count as luck . So I think for a second that Everyarm might actually be generous . It makes me feel I 've been behaving crabbily and unfairly , which in my experience is rarely the same thing , so I decide to give the marine a chance , for the sake of luck , and do n't they say " lucky dragon " anyway ? <p> This is the line of thinking that gets me to stick my book in with the magazines , and I stick it in there demonstratively , giving the elastic a solid snap . " Well ! " says the marine with a nod of approval and the kind of smile that is a fake frown , like That 'll show ' em , and I know I 'm in for it ; I know I 've made a terrible , terrible mistake . I grew up watching movies about encountering soldiers on trains . They wore their green uniforms and caps and gold pins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see him waiting for my eyes of wonder to come out . I 'm as pretty as he is squat and I 'll do , I 'm sure , in this real life version . Chugga-chugga goes the airplane , gushing upward , and I grasp my armrests , and the marine in street clothing watches over me as I do . I think of another set of movies where the girl encounters the soldier in his green outfit at a carnival and they go on a ride on a roller coaster , how she screams with glee and , I believe , if I remember correctly , what he does is sit grimly , knowing all too well what real fear is all about , something he will never be able to put into words . <p> So here the suspense is beating in my shirt pocket all over again as I 'm waiting for him to launch into the speech I realize I 'm expecting because of a couple previous travel experiences where there was a current soldier and he 1 ) sidled up to someone by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that put into the situation that he was a soldier and was either headed out or coming back , which 3 ) left the opening for him to be congratulated , which actually took the form of the two people exchanging loudly their coincidentally identical ideas about the war and the heroism of the soldier , as well as the sixth man back home ; 4 ) this happened once in a smoking room when a soldier offered a light to a guy and I quit not long after that , related or unrelated ; 5 ) another time it was a woman with little kids and a lot of colorful luggage , and one of the little kids slipped , and the soldier lifted the kid up by the arm and the mother said , " I can get that , but thank you , " and he said , " It 's been a long time since I 've seen kids ! " and it went on from there ; 6 ) and also a couple other occasions , one of which , I suspected , watching , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war but had normal hair , or was without whatever other sign might make the soldier think this was n't a good time to be helpful , so here 's this look I catch and I ca n't tell by the soldier 's face whether or not he catches it , but the look comes from this deeply uncomfortable guy with normal hair who is looking , looking , for a sign of something in the eyes of the soldier as he straightens himself out from having started to bend down to pick up the thing he dropped that the soldier got to first and was holding out for him , grinning , hovering , affable as a pudgy family man flying with kids , 7 ) waiting-the marine on this airplane this time-waiting , I predict , for the moment in the conversation , batted so far in my imagination like eyes bat , like Spanish fans aflutter , like a volley in badminton , airy and coy , when he can launch into the speech he has adopted from his commanders , as if from memory , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deviously composed acknowledgment of personal human frailty to make it all sound personal no matter who says it , 8 ) hoping-me now-in a shameful way , that what will happen instead is this soldier will turn to me and say , " You know what ? Fuck the Marines , " the way I read so many of them feel but I 've yet to encounter while traveling , and shock me into the wet dream of having been wrong . <p> Still , all he 's said so far is , " WeU . " I think about luck of the draw . I think about the other sides of coins . I think about probability and about economics . We 've taken off and are past the concerted gunning upward through cloud layers but before the fully leveled off and before the plinking to dark of the **42;2332;TOOLONG sign . I 'm self-aware enough to know that this , what I am doing , is panicking , and it might be being accompanied by nausea or shortness of breath , and I might be having difficulty noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remedy is the same , I realize , and start pawing through the blue seat pocket , looking for the little white airsickness bag with its wire closure thing constructed , disconcertingly , like bags for coffee beans . But there is no little bag in the pouch because they 've gone the way of peanuts , I 'm guessing , or it got used in a previous flight and because of gas prices no one goes through to restock . I scramble around in the middle pocket , too , and find nothing but magazines and headphones that have lost their foam ear cushions . <p> Then my jaw drops at myself because in my panic , I realize , I am giving the marine exactly what he wants , which is a chance to help me out by , perhaps , looking in his own seat pocket or asking me what 's wrong , because something is terribly , terribly wrong as anyone could tell by my panicking demeanor . I keep my eyes buried in the seat pocket as these ideas come into focus for me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they come methodically paced and in a row-serve to calm me enough that by the time I turn my head on my neck with skeptical deliberation , I am actually feeling fine ; in fact , I 'm feeling tense and expectant in my back teeth but relaxed almost everywhere else , which I notice as I turn my head like that nice guy in the airport who dropped something , because I am bracing myself to get a look at my marines face , and when I do , I see he 's got headphones on , and his eyes are closed , and he 's either asleep or listening carefully to extremely boring music . <p> I think about this . The almost completely relaxed feeling I continue to experience arrived , I realize , from suddenly having no idea what was going to happen . Let me try to think of something it 's like : I 'm married again , this time to Everyarm , and we 're having a dinner party and we 've been fighting again so I 'm waiting for the fight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all evening long , which I 'm used to by now because this is what they mean by marriage is work . At this point , we 're in the living room , which looks great because I spent a lot of time arranging the living room , and people are lounging on multiple levels , one on the sofa with his legs stretched out , one , a woman in a peach-colored outfit , on the carpet , leaning sideways against the ottoman at the knees of another woman , this one in lavender ( it 's spring and I brought in a lot of tulips ) , both eating pie la mode from china plates , everyone arranged as if by their own will on the platforms I set there for them ( I used to be a window dresser and this brings back the days ) . So far the evening has gone in waves , each course , each tableau , as we move from the foyer to the patio to the dining room and so on , each another setting for the way I 'm waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my invited guests , the one in the lavender , and then the one in the peach , as well , both stand up and pull the barrettes from their hair , take their blazers off , take their shoes off , rip the sides of their skirts so they can waggle their knees freely and , I do n't know , dance ? Strip ? Walk out ? Start smacking people or juggling the fruit from my fruit bowl ? Turn into butterflies ? Are those the only options I can come up with ? My point is that someone else takes over . Someone , preferably some nice girl in pastels with a sweet tooth , will start doing something , and I have no idea what , and I can stand there at ease in the doorway and not even wonder what Everyarm is doing behind me in the kitchen . <p> Plus , it makes something else beautiful happen , this moment when I give up , which is that in the process of leaning back into my seat to look at the marine properly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the lines that come from his eyes and along the stray hairs of his eyebrows that are quivering almost imperceptibly , and one or two are gray or at least look it for a shivery second , and only because of the care with which I am looking do I perceive this movement . It 's easy to see what has been produced . It 's a brief if bona fide affection , it 's the magic of silence and stillness , the pause that makes anything possible , the mystery of the interior lives of animals , the sense of character one gets from a blooming field , or a craggy beach , or a drenched log , or a tundra , or a lawn , or a curving range of mountains . <p> I just ca n't take it for very long . <p> I lay one hand on my seat belt and take my book from the pocket . Then I fasten my eyes on the row of lighted signs ; fasten more specifically on the one about getting up to move about the cabin . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes behind the other , poised , ready , and when the thing clicks off and emits a rounded-off version of " bong ! " I 've ripped open my belt and am out of my seat so fast I think the vacuum I 've left will surely wake him . Lucky I 'm not there to see it . I sprint to the lavatory as if I 've been expelled from a cannon , as if either this much speed or something in the lavatory itself will actually allow me out of the entire predicament . <p> I feel good about the lavatory because of how the door only closes if you latch it and because when you latch the door the message behind the glass changes colors and slides from VACANT to OCCUPIED , both words that mean a lot to me in this environment . Still , I experience a wave of anxiety , an echo of sorts , as I slide the latch from one place to the other . As a child , I spent the time in unfamiliar bathrooms imagining I lived there , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the little room held everything I needed , that my bed folded down from a wall the way , it occurs to me now , the flight attendant 's seat pops out in some smaller aircraft designs . I 'd picture where there 'd be a burner for cooking or a refrigerated slot where I could push a button and the next thing to eat would slide out of it . What was attractive about this imagined way of life ? Nothing wasted , everything merely sufficient , simply enough , no room left over , no confusion , a lot of silence . Elemental . But I was also a verbal child .... I do n't know what childhood has to do with it anyway . People go there for easy answers . <p> I do n't throw up in the lavatory , and I do n't want to do any deep breathing in there , and as I said , I 'm calm enough now anyway , so I look at myself in the mirror and then in the stainless steel wall , and then try to picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just want to cry or spit . I 'm holding my book and I smack it down on the sink . It 's the size of a brick and slides around once as if oiled . It gets a little wet . I think maybe I 'll just put the lid down on the commode and sit there and read , so I try that , and the light is so bad the words fuzz apart , and I feel a little sick again-a wet book is depressing anyway-and then someone shakes the door . <p> Probably I should n't worry because what will happen is I wo n't talk with anybody until we touch down and I have to ask someone to help me get my bag . Talking is less and less the culture of airplanes , in any case , with the increasing electronics . Back in the heyday of air travel , as I remember it , a much larger segment of the flying population got worked up to plop down next to a stranger , and as long as the stranger was n't too ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd spill it , just swap life stories while others swapped fluids in the lavatory , everyone ships in the night together . But when it comes down to it , I 'm just not going to be able to talk to this marine because the stakes are too high now , and when the stakes are this high there 's no way that if the guy opens his mouth and says anything he can possibly remain a whole human being . Once you fall into a camp , you 're gone , you 're good as dead , and it 's been a long time since I saw anything that did n't fall into a camp . I can do all kinds of gymnastic contortions around your head , but if you believe what I know you believe I 'm just going to spaz out by your ear , flicker like a firefly losing its bulb , and keel over like a doornail . This thought is what allows me to slide the latch back and get on with it . <p> Outside , a gathering has accumulated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their seats , and the overhead speaker is going on about one person at a time and , once again , where the several lavatories are located . I have to go back to back and then belly to belly with one and then more people , dragging my feet , still not knowing what I 'll do ; maybe he 'll be sleeping and I can just sit there and get used to whatever his face is like . But then I get to a row with a huge lady by the window and no one else there , so on impulse I sit in the aisle seat and put my nose in my book as if that will make me invisible . I hear the lady making laughing breaths out of her nostrils until I look over . The flesh around her face is vibrating as if she 's angry , but she 's not , it 's just the plane , I think , because the vibrating is somehow separate from the swallowed laughter . But who knows . She 's showing me how amused she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My husband will be back , you know . " She has a superior voice that creeps me out anyway , so I get up , this time at least with a little hope that there 'll be another spot , and there is-I even pass up a person on the aisle with no one farther in because I do n't want to have to crawl over-so I sit in this next available aisle seat , thinking there ca n't be too many people wandering around , it 's a big plane but the flight attendants seem on top of things , and this time the person by the window is a skinny man wearing a shriveled shirt and a fedora , and when I sit down he looks pissed but does n't say anything , although he does keep peering at me from under his brim until that creeps me out such that I close my book again and get up , thinking this is turning into a picaresque minus actual adventure . <p> Now , with me standing in the aisle , and I 'm the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , and I 'm looking up the blue river at my near future , elbow after elbow , curved aspects of arm flesh , wisps of hair and clothing , now , in this moment , when I am about to push off , is when the plane starts shaking . It bobs and shakes and then everyone 's signs start plinking and the captain comes on and talks about turbulence and air pockets . I stumble forward in the river and catch myself right by my seat , as if by chance , so I just take it , I just take my seat next to the hero and sit in it like a spoiled brat , stick my book back behind the elastic band , adjust and readjust my seat belt and then stare at it , thinking its shiny head is like the head of a serpent that 's actually eating and spitting its tail out again in one suspended gulp . The plane rocks . The organs in my body stumble and float . The marine is awake and stunned . His headphones wobble around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peek into the aisle and a guy is tossing himself out of the lavatory , trying to hold his pants up and also drag himself along , seat by seat , as the plane bucks . <p> I sit back up and a flight attendant wearing her hat is flung by . Carts rattle , and people might be making noise , but somehow I do n't hear them . All I hear are things . The oxygen masks drop and dangle like a sea full of jellyfish . I think of swimming laps with my eyes open , which I do ; when I swim laps at home , I keep my wary eyes on the blue lane stripe beneath me as it wiggles in the water . I think of how equidistant I remain from it when I swim , traveling as if at thirty thousand feet in the blue , the snake wiggling like an echo of my swimming body , vibrating and stretching down there , interminably headless and tailless . My book pops out of the seat pocket and slides away down the aisle and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jacket in the seat between us . I take his hand . I just do . " Picture we 're on a roller coaster , " I tell him , and he sits back and nods , setting his face with determination . <p> Soon we are in a field of unidentified crops , and smoking bits of organic and inorganic debris pufflike campfires or small geysers as far as my eyes can see . People are sitting around on suitcases like little islands while other people wander , clinging to their seat cushions , looking similar , different , and dazed by the sun , dotting the landscape but clearly in love with the moment , I can tell by the open looks on their faces , because now they know that the seat cushions really do detach , and they know that of all the things that could have happened , one being they died and one being they lived , one of them has already happened , allowing all of us who arrived to arrive in this other moment when , really , we have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
