It was quite a sight . There was the oldest man in the D-day invasion , 56year-old Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr . ( son of the former President ) barking orders at Utah Beach . Although he had a heart condition , Roosevelt insisted that his presence and leadership would help boost troop morale . With German artillery exploding all around him , he paraded up and down Utah Beach , ordering U.S. tanks to secure the flanks and U.S. engineers to breach eight 50-yd. lanes through beach obstacles . He refused to wear a helmet , preferring to don a knit wool hat . " We have landed in the wrong place , " shouted Roosevelt , who would receive the Medal of Honor for his valor that day . " But we will start the war from here . " <P> Everything about D-day was dramatic  --  the overarching strategy , the vast mobilization , the sheer number of troops . But it 's the daring boldness and intrepid courage of the men that stand out . One can read biographies of Dwight Eisenhower or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to understand D-day , the largest invasion force ever assembled , is as a battle at its smallest : that is , one soldier and one reminiscence at a time . <P> The landing target of the D-day invaders was a 50-mile stretch of shoreline in the middle of the Cherbourg  --  Le Havre crescent in France . On the night of June 5 , the operation began as Allied paratroopers boarded planes and gliders . " O.K. , let 's go " was Eisenhower 's direct order . Just after midnight , June 6 , they began landing behind enemy lines , with orders to attack and destroy German gun batteries . Meanwhile , an armada started making its way toward the designated beaches . Allied troops began landing at 6:30 a.m . Wading through the water onto French soil , they met vastly different fates . At Utah Beach , the farthest west , bombardments had decimated the German defenses . Moreover , an opportune navigational mistake had landed the troops at a practically unguarded stretch of the beach . The Americans who landed there sustained relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Gold and Juno beaches fought their way ashore , according to plan , and were soon followed by tanks , the mere sight of which swept most of the German resistance away . The fighting was harder at Sword Beach , where German defenders stiffened against the specter of the Allies ' capturing the nearby city of Caen . The hardest fighting of all raged throughout the day on the fifth beach , Omaha . It was a relatively narrow strand of shoreline overshadowed by 100-ft. cliffs . Troops trying to land there found themselves in a horrifying position , vulnerable to machine-gun and mortar fire from above . The only route out lay through four ravines carved by the wind and water through the cliffs . American soldiers were bewildered , their officers were confused , and their comrades were lying dead all around , in the water and on the beach . In the chaos , there were not even any boats to evacuate the wounded , many of whom died on Omaha of injuries that would have been treatable on any other beach . By late morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing through the air , some troops managed to drag themselves up the cliffs in small fighting forces . By the end of the day , at a cost too high to be measured in mere statistics , they took the beach and carved out a piece of Free France 2 miles wide and 6 miles long .
