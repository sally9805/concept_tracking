<p> " The Passionate Gesture " at Hackett-Freedman invites us to think about whether and how we can recognize unrehearsed expressiveness in art . <p> Modernism staked itself on fresh starts , or faith in them , again and again . Impressionism , Fauvism , Cubism , Futurism , Surrealism , Constructivism , on down to Pop Art , minimalism and conceptual art  --  all purported to originate or restart some project of formal , political or aesthetic progress . <p> To this day , the search for something novel in individual temperament , or in the solidarity of an artistic cohort , has not abated , although nowadays the art market seeks it even more aggressively than do young artists themselves . <p> " The Passionate Gesture " presents miscellaneous works by first- and second-generation Abstract Expressionists from both coasts and a couple of painters responsive to them from abroad . Each piece on view invites us to gauge it as a mirror of our hope of seeing artistic spontaneity . Perhaps Robert Motherwell 's black-on-white " Untitled " ( 1970 ) corresponds best to our notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds . Perhaps Norman Bluhm 's " Steel Grass " ( 1964 ) does , or Michael Goldberg 's " The Last Apartment #1 " ( 1959 ) . <p> But how much does knowledge of these works ' biographical background sharpen or blur our judgment ? How much does it matter that Motherwell counts as a first-generation Abstract Expressionist  --  and one of the few writers to articulate his and his friends ' ambitions  --  while Bluhm , Goldberg , Joan Mitchell and others fall into the " second generation " ? Can such facts vitiate unprompted reception of the paintings themselves ? Can it ever fail to ? <p> Consider Mitchell 's " Untitled " ( 1957 ) . You might see in it a painter testing the limits of finish and compositional coherence by stripping her picture to a few almost haphazardly connected brushstrokes . Or you might see her straining a little desperately to simulate the confident improvisation of paintings such as the Motherwell , the Bluhm or the Mark Tobey ink drawing on view . <p> Yet another defensible reading might see Mitchell daringly thinning her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also gestures and their tremors of intent  --  as a means of re-enlivening an exhausted pictorial rhetoric . <p> The present selection will not settle the question whether artists ' generational ( or geographical ) positions prejudice interpretation of their work , but it highlights some of the critical quandaries nicely , quandaries that any viewer faces , not just art professionals . <p> Compare the Franz Kline ink drawing here with one from a few years later by Richard Diebenkorn , and you see immediately how contrasts in temperament can engage the eye far more completely than art historical facts do the mind . A group show such as " The Passionate Gesture " may deliver scant sense of a period or of a shared sensibility to visitors not informed about them beforehand . But its considered presentation sets up some enlightening comparisons  --  enlightening as to the stakes involved in description , context , nomenclature and the deployment of facts . <p> The inadvertent import of " The Passionate Gesture " : that the ambiguities of an artwork  --  even an abstract one  --  do not inhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisitions at Fraenkel : You can test the same proposition in other ways in " The Book of Shadows , " an array of anonymous photographs at Fraenkel . A single thread connects every picture here : Each contains a shadow cast by the person who took it . <p> In any single case , we would probably dismiss such a flaw as the mere signature of an amateur . But get a few dozen examples together and a typology seems to emerge . Certain pictures look like pure products of accident , of thwarted intentions . In others , the incident shadows appear positioned with comical care , bringing to mind canonical images by Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander . <p> In one striking , ostensibly banal , shot of a car , the photographer 's shadow falling on the foreground pavement reinforces a bizarre misreading of the image . A dark patch on the ground  --  perhaps an oil stain  --  stands between the car and camera , just right in size and shape to make us see it as a shadow the car casts as it inexplicably levitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shadows " with the oddities of staged photography  --  a relatively recent art trend  --  in mind will find them presaged in the anonymous , amateur photography on view . <p> Throughout the show William Henry Fox Talbot 's definition of photography as " the art of fixing a shadow " echoed in my mind . " The Book of Shadows "  --  for which Fraenkel has produced a hardcover catalog  --  suggests that shadows as phenomena and as metaphors lie close to the roots of photography as an art and its connoisseurship . <p> Connoisseurship always comes into play in the annual shows that Fraenkel titles " Several Exceptionally Good Recently Acquired Pictures . " <p> The 19th installment surprises mainly by the disparate criteria of appreciation its contents imply . Any gallery would , if it could , snap up the four posthumous prints of pictures by Diane Arbus , or the six examples of Friedlander 's full-length portraits of trees in parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted . <p> But the portraits by Katy Grannan and Nan Goldin , and Idris Khan 's conceptual exercise in multiple exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic radiance , something little in evidence in Fraenkel 's previous arrays of new acquisitions . <p> As usual , Fraenkel has tried to group pictures to bring out submerged affinities . The present selection lends itself to this exercise less involvingly than those of years past . The best wall holds Arbus ' " House on a Hill , Hollywood , Cal . " ( 1963 ) , a movie-set facade against a mackerel sky ; Adam Fuss ' untitled photogram , looking like an X-ray of an antique child 's dress ; and Winogrand 's " Peace Demonstration , Central Park , New York " ( 1970 ) . Each evokes a fragment of a whole lost or never to be fulfilled . <p> The Passionate Gesture : Paintings , sculpture and drawings . Through Aug. 31 .
