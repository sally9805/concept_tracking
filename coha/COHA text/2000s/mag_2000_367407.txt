They probably sold the idea with the pitch meeting 's first phrase : " Jackie Chan in the Old West . " Surely the deal was sealed when they mentioned his character 's name : Chon Wang . It may be , as someone in the film says , a terrible name for a cowboy , but soften that g , and it sounds a lot like that of a certain massive movie star who won immortality playing Western heroes . <P> Chan , of course , is a smallish , sweet-smiling man whose sense of humor irresistibly enlightens his martial artistry . In Shanghai Noon he 's a guard in China 's Forbidden City who intrudes himself on a mission to rescue Princess Pei-Pei ( Lucy Liu ) , who , avoiding an arranged marriage , has run far , far away to Carson City , Nev . There she is enslaved by Lo Fong ( Roger Yuan ) , an unredeemable bad guy who is exploiting Chinese railroad workers , smuggling dope and demanding a ransom for her . <P> Eyeing his traditional Chinese garb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others think he 's Jewish . The slightly spaced-out Indian tribe that adopts him is just happy that he is visibly not another rapacious white guy . We can be happy that he links up with Roy O'Bannon ( Owen Wilson ) , a train robber with the anachronistic manners of a surfer dude  --  a little too politely countercultural for his line of work and not half as clever as he thinks he is . He looks like a young Robert Redford ( the movie makes a nice satirical reference to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ) , but his genial self-regard  --  assailed by amusing self-doubt when he actually gets into a classic gunfight  --  is all his own . He 's a terrific sidekick to Chan 's funny , earnest , often victimized righteousness . This kid could be a star . <P> The West that he and Chan inhabit is more generic than authentic  --  come to think of it , a lot like the B-picture West in which the real John Wayne toiled through his early years . It 's the kind of place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad breeding  --  for their depredations , where barroom brawls blow up for no good reason and where plains , mountains and deserts are mixed without any particular geo-logic . This , of course , frees the director , Tom Dey , to play fast and loose with other kinds of logic . In his West , horses sit down when you need them to be up and doing , Indian princesses are as sportively knowing as any of the gals in Sex and the City , and a guy buried up to his neck in sand manages to dig himself out with a pair of chopsticks . <P> Structurally , Shanghai Noon is not exactly a tribute to narrative coherence . But that 's all right . It 's meant to be a fantastic stage for Chan 's quick hands and fast feet . The man is a human special effect . And as always , he gives a full measure of devotion to his blindingly choreographed action sequences . <P> Increasingly , though , we go to Jackie Chan movies not for the star 's good moves but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could ruin with slickness and overmounting , the sort of performer who flourishes in the hip-casual context that screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar have provided him here . Everyone 's having a good time , but they 're not winking at us either  --  making us parties to their in-jokes . As a result , we have a swell time too . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
