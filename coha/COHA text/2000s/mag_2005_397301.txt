Section : Muscle Muscle myths linger , and hurt . Is your workout past its sell-by date ? <p> IN A HOSPITAL , USING OUTDATED INFORMATION is considered malpractice ; in a gym , it 's standard operating procedure . Do n't believe it ? Take a look at today 's most sacred lifting guidelines , and you 'll find that some originated in the ' 40s and ' 50s , a time when castration was a cutting-edge treatment for prostate cancer , and endurance exercise was thought to be harmful to women . What 's worse , other , more-recent recommendations regarding exercise form have been negated by new research yet are still commonly prescribed by fitness professionals . <p> Chances are , these are the same rules you lift by right now . And that means your workout is long past due for a 21st-century overhaul . Keep in mind , I 'm not suggesting that your current plan does n't work . After all , at its most basic level , building muscle is simple : Pick up a heavy weight , put it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 'll build more muscle in less time , with less risk of injury . Put a check next to today 's date  --  it marks the official expiration of your old workout . THE AGE-OLD ADVICE : " DO EIGHT TO 12 REPETITIONS . " <p> The claim : It 's the optimal repetition range for building muscle . <p> The origin : In 1954 , Ian MacQueen , M.D. , an English surgeon and competitive bodybuilder , published a scientific paper in which he recommended a moderately high number of repetitions for muscle growth . <p> The truth : This approach places the muscles under a medium amount of tension for a medium amount of time , making it both effective for and detrimental to maximum muscle gains . <p> A quick science lesson : Higher tension  --  a.k.a , heavier weights  --  induces the type of muscle growth in which the muscle fibers grow larger , leading to the best gains in strength ; longer tension time , on the other hand , boosts muscle size by increasing the energy-producing structures around the fibers , improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetitions strikes a balance between the two . But by using that scheme all the time , you miss out on the greater tension levels that come with heavier weights and fewer repetitions , and the longer tension time achieved with lighter weights and higher repetitions . <p> The new standard : Vary your repetition range  --  adjusting the weights accordingly  --  so that you stimulate every type of muscle growth . Try this method for a month , performing three full-body sessions a week : Do five repetitions per set in your first workout , 10 reps per set in your second workout , and 15 per set in your third workout . THE AGE-OLD ADVICE : " DO THREE SETS OF EACH EXERCISE . " <p> The claim : This provides the ideal workload for achieving the fastest muscle gains . <p> The origin : In 1948 , a physician named Thomas Delorme reported in the Archives of Physical Medicine that performing three sets of 10 repetitions was as effective at improving leg strength as 10 sets of 10 repetitions . <p> The truth : There 's nothing wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the number of sets you perform should n't be determined by a 50-year-old default recommendation . Here 's a rule of thumb : The more repetitions of an exercise you do , the fewer sets you should perform , and vice versa . This keeps the total number of reps you do of an exercise nearly equal , no matter how many repetitions make up each set . <p> The new standard : Use this chart to determine the number of sets you should do . TABLE THE AGE-OLD ADVICE : " YOU NEED TO DO THREE OR FOUR EXERCISES PER MUSCLE GROUP . " <p> The claim : This ensures that you work all the fibers of the target muscle . <p> The origin : Arnold , circa 1966 . <p> The truth : You 'll waste a lot of time . Here 's why : Schwarzenegger 's 4-decade-old recommendation is almost always combined with " Do three sets of eight to 12 repetitions . " <p> That means you 'll complete up to 144 repetitions for each muscle group . Trouble is , if you can perform even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not working hard enough . Think of it this way : The harder you train , the less time you 'll be able to sustain that level of effort . For example , many men can run for an hour if they jog slowly , but you 'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who could do high-intensity sprints  --  without a major decrease in performance  --  for that period of time . And once performance starts to decline , you 've achieved all the muscle-building benefits you can for that muscle group . <p> The new standard : Instead of focusing on the number of different exercises you do , shoot for a total number of repetitions between 25 and 50 . That could mean five sets of five repetitions of one exercise ( 25 repetitions ) or one set of 15 repetitions of two or three exercises ( 30 to 45 repetitions . ) THE AGE-OLD ADVICE : " NEVER LET YOUR KNEES GO PAST YOUR TOES . " <p> The claim : Allowing your knees to move too far forward during exercises such as the squat and lunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The origin : A 1978 study at Duke University found that keeping the lower leg as vertical as possible during the squat reduced shearing forces on the knee . <p> The truth : Leaning forward too much is more likely to cause injury . In 2003 , University of Memphis researchers confirmed that knee stress was 28 percent higher when the knees were allowed to move past the toes during the squat . But the researchers also found a countereffect : Hip stress increased nearly 1,000 percent when forward movement of the knee was restricted . The reason : The squatters had to lean their torsos farther forward . And that 's a problem , because forces that act on the hip are transferred to the lower back , a more frequent site of injury than the knees . <p> The new standard : Focus more on your upper body and less on knee position . By trying to keep your torso as upright as possible as you perform squats ( and lunges ) , you 'll reduce the stress on your hips and back . Two tips for staying upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold them that way ; and as you squat , try to keep your forearms perpendicular to the floor . THE AGE-OLD ADVICE : " WHEN YOU LIFT WEIGHTS , DRAW IN YOUR ABS . " <p> The claim : You 'll increase the support to your spine , reducing the risk of back injuries . <p> The origin : In 1999 , researchers in Australia found that some men with back pain had a slight delay in activating their transverse abdominis , a deep abdominal muscle that 's part of the musculature that maintains spine stability . As a result , many fitness professionals began instructing their clients to try to pull their belly buttons to their spines  --  which engages the transverse abdominis  --  as they performed exercises . <p> The truth : " The research was accurate , but the interpretation by many researchers and therapists was n't , " says Stuart McGill , Ph.D. , author of Ultimate Back Fitness and Performance and widely recognized as the world 's top researcher on the spine . That 's because muscles work in teams to stabilize your spine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says McGill . Read : The transverse abdominis is n't always the quarterback . In fact , for any given exercise , your body automatically activates the muscles that are most needed for spine support . So focusing only on your transverse abdominis can overrecruit the wrong muscles and underrecruit the right ones . This not only increases injury risk , but reduces the amount of weight you can lift . <p> The new standard : If you want to give your back a supporting hand , simply " brace " your abs as if you were about to be punched in the gut , but do n't draw them in . " This activates all three layers of the abdominal wall , improving both stability and performance , " says McGill . Perfect Form <p> Iron out lifting flaws to get the most from these major muscle makers BARBELL SQUAT <p> DO N'T lean forward and bend down a few inches . This puts excessive pressure on your lower back while increasing the stress on your knees . <p> DO sit back ( keep your torso as upright as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at least parallel to the floor . BARBELL BENCH PRESS <p> DO N'T overarch your back or lift your heels off the floor . <p> DO keep your back naturally arched ( the way it is when you first lie down on the bench ) and your feet flat on the floor at all times . DUMBBELL SHOULDER PRESS <p> DO N'T clank the weights together at the top of the movement ; it increases risk of a shoulder-impingement injury without benefiting your muscles . <p> DO push the weights straight above your shoulders . CHINUP <p> DO N'T stop partway down or use momentum to pull yourself back up . <p> DO lower your body until your arms are straight , pause , and then pull yourself back up . Muscle Chow <p> EAT LIKE A COVER MODEL BY GREGG AVEDON BEEF UP <p> I 'M OFTEN ASKED if I have only protein shakes after my workouts . Yeah , right ! I always take in a hearty serving of postworkout protein and carbohydrates to speed along the muscle-building process , but , like every other health-conscious guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of tasty recipes to keep them interesting . <p> So , a couple of times a month , I chow down on a burger after my workout . But not the kind you pick up at your local grease joint . My Power Burger is loaded with high-quality animal protein , iron , magnesium , B vitamins , vitamin E , and other antioxidants . The bread and apple add carbohydrates to help replenish glycogen stores and drive protein to your muscles . Power Burger TABLE <p> Put the first 5 ingredients in a large mixing bowl and knead with your hands until they 're well mixed . Make 4 thin patties , then roll them in the wheat germ until they 're covered . Next , grill or pan-fry one of the burgers to your liking . Place it on the bun , roll , or bread , and top with the condiments of your choice . <p> This makes 4 patties . Eat one and wrap the other three individually in plastic wrap , then store them in the freezer . ( I often buy 2 pounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gym , take one out and throw it in the fridge . By the time you get home , it 'll be thawed and ready to cook . <p> Visit Men 's Health cover model Gregg Avedon 's Web site , greggavedon.com . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Michael Mejia , C.S.C.S. <p>
