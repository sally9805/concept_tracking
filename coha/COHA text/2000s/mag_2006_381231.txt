History must not be treated as something set off by itself , " said Teddy Roosevelt in 1912 , and that could well be the motto of our Making of America series . I 'm Rick Stengel , and I 'm delighted that my first issue as managing editor of TIME is our fifth annual Making of America issue . One of the great missions of TIME since we started 83 years ago has been explaining the challenges of the moment in the context of history  --  and relating the values of our history to the challenges of the moment . That 's why we started the series in the first place  --  to explore how America has grown and evolved through a long struggle with many of the same issues we 're still grappling with today . Our job as writers and reporters and editors has always been to put the news in perspective for our readers , and few things do that better than history . And while I do n't think history precisely repeats itself , I do agree that it rhymes . <P> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Constitution Center in Philadelphia , a wonderful new museum and educational center on Independence Mall . While there , I got to know the great historian David McCullough , who has been on a one-man campaign to end the epidemic of what he calls historical illiteracy . I believe that our Making of America series is an antidote to historical illiteracy , which David describes as a great danger to our democracy . Being an American is not based on a common ancestry , a common religion , even a common culture  --  it 's based on accepting an uncommon set of ideas . And if we do n't understand those ideas , we do n't value them ; and if we do n't value them , we do n't protect them . A nation can never be ignorant and free , said Thomas Jefferson , our third Making of America cover subject , and one of the goals of our series is to help explain what makes us a nation and a people . <P> TIME helps our readers understand what matters , and our terrific package on Teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the paradigm of today 's politics . I also want to pay tribute to those who created our Roosevelt issue . It was overseen by Priscilla Painton and Richard Lacayo , who was a superb player-coach and wrote two pieces for the issue . We commissioned pieces from the historian Paul Kennedy and some of Roosevelt 's most prominent recent biographers , including Kathleen Dalton , Candice Millard and Patricia O'Toole . Presidential adviser Karl Rove sent in his story Friday morning , and it instantly became the endpiece of the package . The striking cover portrait is by the artist Michael J. Deas , who has now painted four of our Making of America cover images . D.W. Pine designed the splendid-looking package , Jackson Dykman created the one-of-a-kind graphics , Jay Colton was tireless in finding distinctive pictures , and reporters Andrea Dorfman and Deirdre van Dyk completely immersed themselves in T.R. 's life . " I am not in the least concerned as to whether I will have any place in history , " Roosevelt wrote in 1906 , " and , indeed , I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have thought about it a great deal , and we hope you 'll agree that our stories on Teddy Roosevelt help you understand not only him but also the world he helped create .
