<p> Pat Tillman redefines the phrase ' sports hero . ' In an age where it seems everyone callously uses terms of battle to describe a sporting event , Tillman walked away from a lucrative career as an NFL player and embraced the life of a U.S. soldier . In doing so , he made the ultimate sacrifice and laid down his life in Afghanistan . <p> Tillman himself may have been quieted , but his principles shout loud and clear : True heroes do n't catch or hit balls for thousands of dollars . A court or playing field is not a combat zone . A game played under spotlights on manicured grass is not a war . <p> It 's time to reserve the label of ' hero ' for those who run into collapsing buildings to rescue strangers , those who teach math in rundown , gang-infested schools , and those who fall on foreign soil fighting to liberate societies halfway around the world . <p> Rest well , Pat Tillman . Your selfless , heroic actions remind us all that life is not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity . <p> RANDALL A. POLLIARD <p> Denver <p>  --  Mining industry does n't oppose reforming law <p> Re : ' Uncle Sam giving away land , ' April 10 editorial . <p> The Post 's editorial criticizing the issuance of the patents in the Mount Emmons area wrongly implies that the industry opposes reform of the General Mining Law of 1872 . In fact , the mining industry has long supported reforming the General Mining Law to require the payment of fair market value for lands obtained under new patents . Congress actually passed such legislation in 1995 , but then President Clinton vetoed the bill in response to protests from certain environmental groups . <p> The editorial contended that the Mining Law sanctions ' giveaways ' of public land that companies could easily sell for development or non-mining purposes . The process is no giveaway . The federal government manages 623 million acres of public land in the United States , yet less than 1 percent of those lands has been converted to private ownership under mineral patents since the mid-1800s . Mining companies will have invested millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing a single ounce from a given mineral deposit . <p> Companies also face long delays in seeking approvals to mine , a fact that has discouraged new mining investment in the United States . The current situation at Mount Emmons is no exception . The patents issued this year were applied for in 1992 . <p> The industry is in the business of developing mining projects , not converting them to ski resorts or other non-mining uses . We reject the assertion that we are opposed to reasonable and constructive reform of the General Mining Law . Uncertainty over the status of the Mining Law and the inability of Congress to enact reasonable reform measures is discouraging mineral development in the United States and making our nation more reliant on mineral imports , which have risen sevenfold since 1993 . <p> STUART A. SANDERSON , President <p> Colorado Mining Association <p> Denver <p>  --  Beer ads contribute to state 's party image <p> During the hockey playoff season , our family is glued to the television . Unfortunately , in addition to the great Avalanche hockey games , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Coors , and it 's good strategy on their part : A lot of hockey fans like to drink beer , and even better if it 's at a party with beautiful young women . Too bad a lot of hockey fans are also young , impressionable children , like my 10-year-old son and my friend 's teenage daughter . <p> Coors commercials are full of images of beer , wild parties , fast young women and young men having a great time . The trouble is , those young men and women look like they could be teens or college-age kids . Children nowadays are trying to grow up so fast , and these images look to them like what they should be aspiring to . Not only is the message that you need to drink beer to have fun , but the women in these images are merely decoration , sex objects , if you will . <p> With Coors in our state , no wonder the University of Colorado is the No. 1 party school and home of a big sex-and-alcohol scandal . <p> KATHY REINER <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only kids got the same regard as dogs , ' April 23 Diane Carman column . <p> People like Diane Carman need to realize that their hostile rebuke of people who love and help animals does no good . No purpose is served in trying to pit people who care about animals against people who care about kids . Both are worth our love and assistance . <p> It seems as though whenever an animal-abuse story hits the news and people who love animals reach out with concern and financial assistance , someone speaks out with fury because an animal has been saved , rather than a child . <p> Kids and animals both need our help . Since Carman does n't think animals are worth our love and help , she should do something positive . Instead of writing columns criticizing our efforts , she should do more to help kids . If she is doing something now , she should do more of that ' something . ' <p> Stop fussing about those of us who choose to put our charitable efforts toward a different cause ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would never criticize people who reach out and help children . <p> M. ENGEL <p> Denver <p> Simple solution <p> Re : ' Treatment of Colo. immigrant workers unfair , report says , ' April 21 business news story . <p> It would be easier to read your article if you would refer to immigrants who have ' no documents ' as illegal immigrants . The solution is simple . If they are illegal immigrants , then they and The Denver Post have nothing to complain about . Referring them to the federal government might be helpful , because they seem to be the only entity that has the authority to enforce the laws regarding illegal immigrants . I am disgusted that The Denver Post is wasting ink supporting people who are not supposed to be here . <p> FRANK MIDDLETON <p> Denver <p> ' Pure double-talk ' <p> The Post 's article is pure double-talk from word one . Twisting the English language , The Post uses the phrase ' immigrant ' as if all immigrants are equal - those who came here properly and those who busted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Are we a country or not ? If having a law against breaking into a country is not acceptable , what other laws do open-borders people dislike - red vs. green lights ? Speed limits ? How about laws against robbing banks ? <p> No one voted for this invasion . I once tried to sneak into Canada because they did not let me in without any money ( even though I was visiting friends ) . You know what they did ? They threw me in jail and deported me . Here , you are rewarded with tuition , health care , and on and on . Enough of the nonsense already . Most Americans want the border sealed , illegals deported and a suspension of all immigration for at least five years . <p> K. MAURICE <p> Boulder <p> Attack at the source <p> While I certainly do n't condone mistreatment of any workers , including illegal aliens , we would n't have the problems The Post refers to if existing immigration laws were enforced .

They were perpetrators . Victims have no choice in their fate , while the killers chose to do what they did of their own free will . Whatever their motivations ( bullying , alienation , fame , insanity ) , their response was inappropriate , immoral and criminal . They did n't intend to kill just 13 people ; they intended to murder hundreds , including me . <p> There can be no justification for what the boys did . However , using letter-writer Paula Jeane 's twisted logic , she would probably excuse Adolf Hitler 's behavior because he had a bad childhood . Maybe she needs to look the families of the 13 innocent victims in the eye before she makes such a ludicrous statement . <p> LEE ANDRES <p> Littleton <p> The writer is a Columbine High School teacher , coach and graduate .
