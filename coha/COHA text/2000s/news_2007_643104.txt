<p> Dead blocks , they call them , the most visible legacy of the latest war in a city with a long history of wars . <p> For four years these vast concrete slabs have slowly crept through Baghdad , snaking along road , river and sidewalk as they shut out light and encircled ministries , palaces and districts . <p> Now , confronted by the inescapable presence and likely longevity of these blast walls , the city has hired two dozen Iraqi artists to soften their harsh gray solidity by using the city 's past to hide its present . <p> Jamaat al-Jidaar , they call themselves : " the Wall Group . " Paid modest stipends that start at about $15 a day , they have spent the past month squatting on scaffolds painting images of warriors , kings and myths from past millennia onto 52 slabs of 12-foot-high concrete beside the Tigris River . <p> All face the ever-present fear of Islamist fanatics  --  on both sides of the Shiite-Sunni divide  --  who have killed , intimidated or driven away thousands of Iraqi artists whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With few opportunities for work , they are delighted with the money , but are also uncomfortably aware that all they can do is paint the symptoms of a conflict that has mired their city in death squads , sectarian violence and crumbling infrastructure , and lost billions of dollars to corruption , waste and mismanagement . <p> A two-minute drive away , a suicide bomber killed 20 people last week . Just behind the artists ' scaffolding , hundreds of Iraqis line up all day trying to buy gasoline , in a land that sits atop some of the world 's largest oil fields . <p> " This is a farce , a parody , that you need so much and you spend money on other things , " said Hassan Ibrahim , 45 , one of the artists . <p> " This neighborhood is close to the Tigris River , and yet we suffer from a shortage of water and power , " he added . " Money is spent on unnecessary things and there is so much embezzlement on other projects . Yet this is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , artistic and aesthetic meaning . " <p> He pointed to newly painted scenes that , he said , depicted an Assyrian king wrestling with a lion , and Mesopotamia 's ancient system of cuneiform writing . <p> " Amid the wreckage and devastation in Iraq this is something good , something hopeful , that we can paint a brighter spot on a wall to make people feel better and more optimistic , " he said . <p> The artists ' first project , a few months ago , turned a soulless stretch of barriers near the capital 's landmark Paradise Square into a neck-craning blur of fishermen 's boats , Arabian stallions , mountains and rural landscapes . <p> The idea grew out of a few informal daubings that appeared on barricades on the east bank of the river . It was picked up by American soldiers working with Iraqi neighborhood councils , and the program gained momentum . <p> The new murals are part of wider beautification works financed by the American military , the Iraqi government and aid organizations as part of an often-foiled effort to renovate Baghdad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art projects will be planned for other sites if the program wins popular support  --  and if the artists stay alive . <p> They have no illusions about the dangers . <p> Their hope , though , is that they will avoid objections to the subject matter by choosing themes like the pre-Islamic Sumerian , Babylonian and Assyrian civilizations in whose scientific , legal and artistic achievements all Iraqis take pride . <p> " This is something beautiful to do such work , bringing to life these dead blocks , " said Tahar , 30 , a graduate of the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad who is among those hired by the Ministry of Works and Social Affairs . " This is seen by all . " <p> Maj. Anthony Judge , the executive officer for the First Battalion , 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment , which has been overseeing revitalization works in the neighborhood , said the intention of all such local projects was to stimulate economic recovery by providing Iraqis with jobs . <p> " We decided that they needed to be painted so that the area did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " We wanted it to be something that people felt comfortable with , and proud of . " <p> These murals are apolitical . They show Babylon 's Ishtar Gate , King Sargon of Akkad , a winged bull with a human head from the palace at Dur Sharrukin , archers , priests and bejeweled queens . <p> However , politics intrude elsewhere . In the Green Zone , outside Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki 's canalside compound , one 15-foot-high barrier bears a far more contemporary message . <p> Here , against a background of a Saddam Hussein-era mound of human skulls , a multicolored mural portrays the triumph of the new era over the old , depicting people breaking free of manacles , casting votes and holding up the purple-ink-stained fingers that were a sign of participation in the country 's first , landmark democratic elections . <p> Mr. Hussein himself was not averse to public art , and some of it remains . Although the thousands of roadside portraits bearing his image are gone , a giant relief of the ruler ordering the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his uniformed , commanding figure . <p> Among the Iraqis lining up to buy gasoline in central Baghdad , opinion was divided on the colorful additions to the city center , although art was not among the highest priorities . <p> " It is 12:30 p.m. , " said Muhammad Hassan , 59 . " I have been here since 8:45 a.m. waiting for my turn to fill the car , and thank God only six cars remain and I will be near the pump soon . " <p> " The paintings are like decoration to beautify ugly concrete barriers , " he added . " They are beautiful and I have no objection if all buildings and shops are to be beautified with similar paintings . We are deprived of beautiful colors . This is simple , and the cost will not affect very much . " <p> However Taha Khames , a 40-year-old laborer , was less supportive . <p> " There is no need for paintings , or barriers , either , " he said . " All this money that has already been spent on barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . We wish the government would remove all barriers as soon as possible , and instead plant trees , asphalt the roads and light street lamps on the main roads . " <p> Confronted with such concerns , one of the artists , Haider Abu Karrar , defended the program on the grounds of pragmatism and inspiration . <p> " If we were to calculate only like this , that we spend money only on projects for people deprived of water and electricity , then life is not going to go on , " he said . " This is putting people to work and making people feel life is going on . " <p> Perhaps uniquely for artists , usually intent on creating an enduring legacy , the Wall Group 's members look forward to the day their work is destroyed . <p> " If the security situation stabilizes enough that they throw my work of art away , that will be for the sake of my city , " Tahar said . " The most important thing is for Baghdad to be secure , that children are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my art . " ##
