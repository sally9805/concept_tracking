<p> Second in a four-part series . <p> Take a walk late on a Saturday night and look at the lights flickering high in the sky . No , they 're not stars . Those are hidden by the city 's usual thick layer of smog . <p> Look closer . The specks of light are the torches of welders hard at work on the 30th floor  --  or is it the 40th , or 50th ?  --  of the office building or apartment tower under construction right next door . <p> Walk around some more and gape at the throngs of smartly dressed urban residents , many with cellular phones glued to their ears . Billboards everywhere show blond , Caucasian models luring the masses with the siren song of Western-style consumerism . <p> This is the face of the world 's next economic superpower  --  or at least the face China likes to show Americans as it prepares for the country 's historic opening to free trade . <p> Chinese leaders say the overwhelming economic success on display in Shanghai and other major cities shows why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status and why the nation should be admitted to the World Trade Organization . <p> Congress is scheduled to vote on permanent status next week , and the debate has become one of the most bitter political fights in recent years . <p> But China 's boom , as real as it is , is only partial . In fact , the move to join the WTO is a gargantuan gamble on the future prosperity of the country 's 1.3 billion people , more than one-fifth of the human race . The impact upon China almost certainly will dwarf the effect of future Chinese trade on the American economy . <p> Congressional approval of permanent status would speed China 's entry to the WTO , the 136-nation group that regulates commerce and investment , and would help attract foreign investment and technology . Beijing 's leaders believe the boost would help create new employment for the tens or even hundreds of millions of people who will probably lose their jobs because of increased foreign imports . <p> In the short term , at least , the Chinese may be in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WTO will accelerate existing trends in the Chinese economy , both positively and negatively , " said Deepak Bhattasali , chief economist in the World Bank 's Beijing office . <p> " On one hand , China has been undergoing the most dramatic economic boom , affecting the greatest number of people , in the history of the world , and the WTO will strengthen that . <p> " . . . On the other , it will be negative for parts of the industrial sector , and the resulting employment dislocations will accelerate the need for putting into place adequate social safety nets . " <p> BEYOND THE GLITTER <p> The risks of China 's gamble are clear in the country 's rust-belt cities , where inefficient , government-owned factories are going bankrupt in droves . <p> In Changchun , a gritty industrial city of 2.5 million people in the far northeast , there 's no glitter like the prosperity of Shanghai . <p> The huge First Automobile Works factory , which produces Volkswagen Jettas and stodgy Chinese sedans , employs 40,000 workers but is planning to cut its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Elsewhere in town , a large tractor factory employing several thousand workers is going out of business . So is a machine-parts factory . Downtown , hundreds of unemployed workers crowd the street corners , hoping for a day or two of odd jobs . <p> They hold signs to their chests : Plumber . Electrician . Construction . And , for women : Baby sitter . <p> Chinese officials do n't like talking about it , but nearly all experts admit that WTO entry will only make matters worse for people in Changchun and cities like it . Sectors expected to suffer adverse affects include : <p>  --  Industry . State-owned firms account for about 40 percent of China 's industrial output , but they are notoriously inefficient and low-tech . In recent years , the government tried to prepare for WTO membership by slashing subsidies and forcing thousands of state-owned firms into bankruptcy . <p>  --  Farming . Under the WTO , the tariffs China levies on U.S. farm products will decline gradually by 2004 from an overall average of 31 percent to 14 percent , and Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials agree that the result will be devastating for Chinese farmers , but they disagree on how much . Official estimates of the number of rural displaced that will have to seek work in towns and cities range from 14 million to more than 300 million . <p>  --  Banks . Foreign institutions are expected to take over a large portion of the nation 's banking system . Chinese banks are tottering under a mountain of bad debt , and many are expected to go bankrupt . According to official statistics , 25 percent of all bank loans are nonperforming , but experts say the real amount is more like 40 percent  --  a level equal to those in Southeast Asian nations prior to the 1997-98 financial crash . By contrast , about 3 percent of U.S. bank loans are nonperforming . <p> OPTIMISM ON THE COAST <p> But if the panorama for many Chinese citizens is bleak , for others it could n't be better . In the large coastal cities , where the economic boom has been concentrated , optimism is in the air . <p> As you marvel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other cities , ask one of the passers-by what he or she thinks about the trade debate roiling the U.S. Congress . <p> " I do n't understand it , " said Zhao Wei , a twentysomething sales executive , with one hand around his girlfriend and the other fiddling with his cellular phone . <p> " We Chinese are working very hard , and we are changing very fast . Look around you . It 's not fair to try to keep us down . " <p> For people whose livelihood is tied to the global information economy or industries where China can produce efficiently , the benefits of membership in the WTO are expected to be big : <p>  --  Manufacturing exports . The United States will be forced to abandon by 2005 its quota system for Chinese apparel , which limits imports and protects the U.S. clothing industry . As a result , Chinese exports of apparel , which were $17 billion last year , are expected to rise rapidly . Chinese exports of footwear , toys and consumer goods also will benefit . <p>  --  Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , computers and Internet firms and will allow Chinese firms to import cutting-edge hardware and software . Chinese leaders expect the foreign investment to help China become a world leader in handheld Internet communications . <p> New foreign investment peaked at $48 billion in 1997 but fell to below $40 billion last year . WTO membership will almost certainly coax foreign firms to once again open wide the money spigot . <p> From the perspective of U.S. businesses , the benefits of China 's gamble far outweigh the drawbacks . <p> " WTO accession wo n't solve all of China 's problems , but it will help integrate its economy into the rules-based world trading system , and it will help lock in the process of reform , " said Timothy Stratford , president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China . <p> Indeed , many Chinese officials view WTO membership as a guarantee that no matter what the social consequences of the country 's shift from communism to capitalism , there will be no turning back . <p> A MORAL CHALLENGE <p> Led by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above all , a moral challenge  --  a test of China 's work ethic and its ability to prove itself against the best the world markets have to offer . <p> Even in Changchun , officials repeat the party-line optimism : The future is high tech , biotech , computer tech , tech everything . <p> " Changchun has a bright future under the WTO , " said Guo Zhen Chang , a top official of the city 's high-tech development zone , which mainly contains auto parts factories , many of which will face severe competition from imports after WTO rules take effect . " It is a moral challenge for us . We will succeed . <p> But underneath his confidence was a note of worry . " And we offer lots to the foreign investor , " he is quick to add . <p> But what about the future of the unemployed workers ? <p> " They have no future , " he said . " We are retraining them , but some fall through the cracks . If they do n't have any high-tech skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no alternative . That 's the way the world is nowadays .
