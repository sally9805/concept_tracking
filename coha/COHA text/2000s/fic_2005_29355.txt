One This is a nightmare . Working at the Toronto Transit Commission 's lost and found . Nine to five . Monday to Friday . A little slice of death , one day at a time . For me it 's a two-month sentence , July and August . I would have been happy bumming around till September , but Dad called in a favor to get me in here . And at least I do n't have to wear a uniform like my bud Wayne over at the Dairy Barn . Wayne 's planning to torch the thing on Labor Day ( the uniform , not the Barn ) before we head back for our last year of high school . So I 'm here under protest , a political prisoner of the capitalist overlord otherwise known as Dad . Here 's the one-minute tour of the place . First , to get here you have to come to Bay subway station and take the service elevator down to the subbasement . At the end of the hall to your left you 'll find the door marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front counter cataloguing the lost junk that comes in from the buses and subways in the transit system . If you think of a half-deflated soccer ball with two of the hairiest ears you 've ever seen attached to it , you 've got a good picture of Jacob . Past the counter there 's a maze of stacks holding row after row , shelf after dusty shelf of lost stuff . I 'm trying on a black leather jacket in the stacks when the bell at the counter dings . The jacket 's term expires in a week , so it 'll soon be appearing in my closet as part of the Duncan collection . One ding of the bell means Jacob needs me to search for something . Two dings means hurry up . Three dings -- things get ugly . When I get to the counter , Jacob 's asking an old woman about the weather up on the surface.Spending eight hours a day in this dungeon , you tend to forget that the sun is still shining up there . " They say it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells him . " Not a cloud in the sky . " It 's been six weeks with no rain . Major heat wave . But down here you 'd never know . The city could be bombed to ashes and we 'd still be here sorting through the piles . " Duncan , we 're looking for a pair of glasses , " Jacob tells me . " Silver frames . Bifocals . " I sigh . " Right . This might take a while . " Eyeglasses rank in the top four on the list of most often lost items , right up there with umbrellas , cell phones , and books . I 'm the runner , the one who does the actual searching . Jacob does the actual sitting . I do n't know who did this job before me -- do n't know if anybody did it before me -- but the place is a mess . The way it works , stuff gets held here for three months . Everything 's got a Post-it with an expiration date . Anything unclaimed gets boxed up for the quarterly sale down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll find stuff that 's been here for two years or more . I pulled a college sweater off the top shelf the other day , and the dust coming off it drifted down like snow . Lost junk is organized in sections . All the jackets are together , including my black leather beauty . Dozens of umbrellas are heaped in a pile , enough rain protection to keep every last flea on Noah 's ark dry . There 's a library of forgotten books overflowing the packed shelves . And there are two boxes of eyeglasses , separated into sunglasses and regular . I dig in . There 's an amazing variety , everything from prescription swimming goggles to your basic thick-black-framed geek glasses to your old-lady specials with the necklace holders attached to the arms . I find a pair that fits the lady 's description -- bifocals , silver frames . Holding them up to peer through the lenses , I see they 've got enough magnifying power to count the hairs on a mosquito 's butt . " That 's them , " the old woman says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims book , as if the glasses are worth more than the dollar they 'd get at the Y sale . " I 'm lost without these , " she tells us . " I 'm so blind without them , I did n't realize until I was halfway here that I 'd put hand lotion on my face instead of sunscreen . I can already feel a burn starting up . " Jacob nods . " Yeah . With the holes in the ozone and global warming , the sun 's not as friendly as it used to be . " The woman shivers , pulling her jacket closed . " Well , it 's certainly cool down here . " " We 're about fifty feet underground -- deeper than the subway tunnels -- so the temperature stays a constant cool year-round . This must be what it feels like to be buried alive . " That 's Jacob 's idea of funny . I think he 's been down here too long . The woman gives him a nervous look and mumbles her thanks as she makes for the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say when she 's gone . No response . I fill a paper cup at the cooler , leaning on it as it gurgles to itself , and watch the clock crawl toward eternity . Jacob goes back to reading the newspaper . Past him , there 's a glass case on the wall that once held a fire axe but now has an artificial leg standing inside . That leg is like the official mascot of all the forgotten junk in the lost and found . There 's a worn-down blue men 's Puma running shoe on its foot , and it 's obviously been well used . It always gets me wondering -- how do you lose something like that ? I mean , did n't the guy notice something was missing when he went hopping off the subway -- that the world was bouncing up and down more than usual ? What happened , that he never came back to claim it ? Jacob says the thing 's been here for three years .                 @ @ @ @
