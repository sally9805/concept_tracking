Whatever you may think of the new Broadway version of La Boheme , there 's a better story of art-world devotion and backstabbing just across the river in Queens , N.Y . That 's where the Museum of Modern Art is squeezed temporarily into a remodeled warehouse in a neighborhood where the sport-utility vehicle of choice is a dump truck . While its Manhattan headquarters is being reconstructed , MOMA is still managing to play host to the kind of exhibition that will bring hundreds of thousands of people to a place with no hot restaurant and no cabs . At a time when the museum blockbuster is threatened by high insurance rates and topic fatigue  --  there are Monet haystacks I see more often than I see my mother  --  " Matisse Picasso , " which comes to the U.S. after hugely successful runs at the Tate Modern in London and the Grand Palais in Paris , is proof that the blockbuster can still be a public service , not to mention a supreme pleasure . It 's only February , but it 's safe to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the first , critical and popular thinking positioned the two artists as the heads of opposing camps . The critic Andre Salmon summed it up in 1910 . " There are lovers of art capable of admiring both Picasso and Matisse , " he wrote . " These are happy folks whom we must pity . " We all know the terms of their face-off . Matisse the color-infatuated voluptuary , Picasso the spiky engineer of Cubist space . Matisse the consoler , Picasso the bomb thrower . Matisse the man who once called for " an art of balance , of purity and serenity , " Picasso the one who said , " In my case , a picture is a sum of destructions . " <P> It would be too much to call these understandings false . There were times , especially in the Cubist years , when Picasso did rush in to places where Matisse feared to tread . And when it comes to color , Picasso , so given to dull greens and nougat browns , is no match for Matisse 's vermilions and aquamarines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past decade or so  --  the lesson this show carries forward  --  is that Matisse was every bit as much the trailblazer . <P> Certainly that was the case when the two men first met in Paris around 1905 . Henri Matisse was then leader of the Fauves  --  the wild beasts  --  whose abruptly brushed , feverishly colored canvases had taken the lessons of Van Gogh and Gauguin to the inevitable far reaches . Pablo Picasso , 12 years younger , was still little known and working  --  though sometimes to surprising effect  --  with the dwindling resources of fin-de-siecle Symbolism . Both men were coming to grips with Cezanne and the means by which he represented space  --  with shallow patches of pigment that create the illusion of depth but still assert themselves as smears of pigment on the surface of the canvas . Matisse was the first to grasp its implications . But Picasso would drive further into them . <P> The recondite mazes of Cubism , so open , so impregnable , are what followed . Very soon , with the ferocity and radical distortions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other artist into cannon fodder and take from Matisse the leadership role within the avant-garde . Georges Braque and Andre Derain , onetime Fauvists , defected to Picasso 's camp . In time Picasso would even usurp Matisse 's position in the affections  --  and worse , in the collection  --  of Matisse 's once devoted patron Gertrude Stein.
