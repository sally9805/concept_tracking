Forget the deep breaths : When life with your baby gets tough and you n eed to calm down fast , repeat one of these // My first child , Anna , was only a few weeks old when I started talking to myself . I was sticking her pudgy arm through the sleeve of a T-shirt , and she whimpered . Had I dislocated her shoulder ? Pinched her ? Then I remembered what the pediatrician 's nurse had said : " Babies are n't fragile . " I said it out loud-and relaxed . " Babies are n't fragile " became the mantra I used when I had to suction out my daughter 's little nose , strap her into a car seat , or give her a dose of medicine . It helped me remember that , tiny as she was , doing these things was n't going to hurt her . Soon I 'd added several other sayings to my repertoire and passed them on to others . In an ideal world , of course , all new parents would be surrounded by wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point , most of us find ourselves alone . Here , to ease the way , are some simple yet soothing truths about child rearing from other moms , as well as grandmothers and pediatricians . Say them-out loud if necessary-as often you need . 1 The only way out is through Debra Rienstra , a mom of three in Grand Rapids , Michigan , says she discovered one of the most basic truths about parenting as she gave birth to each of her babies : Once you 're in labor , the baby has to come out . Says Rienstra , " You ca n't hope someone 's going to come rescue you . " Later she realized that the words that had gotten her through childbirth-the only way out of this is getting through it-continued to hold true after she brought each child home . " There would be times when the baby was crying-and I knew he was n't hungry or in need of changing-so I 'd just make up a plan for getting over it : I 'd walk around the house , then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some music . This would give me a direction to follow rather than stressing out . Often the baby would conk out before I 'd finished . " Rienstra , who 's the author of Great With Child : On Becoming a Mother , found that this kind of take-charge , straight-ahead approach works for many situations . Whether you have an infant throwing food from her high chair or a toddler testing her limits at bedtime , it can seem overwhelming unless you approach it head-on . After all , thinking of a preventive solution to a problem the moment you 're trying to tackle it is mostly a waste of energy , says Rienstra , who notes that the high-chair mess still has to be cleaned or the child sent to bed . ( Later on , you can figure out whether there 's a better alternative. ) 2 Experience makes you the expert Rebecca Unger , M.D. , a pediatrician with the Northwestern Children 's Practice and Children 's Memorial Hospital , in Chicago , has seen new moms go from insecurity to competence and confidence many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop her from feeling fearful when her first child was born . " I was sobbing and scared when I came home from the hospital , " she says . " It 's just overwhelming , no matter how much you know or have read . " Dr. Unger immediately started repeating to herself the words she 'd told the parents in her practice : " You know much more about how to care for your baby on day four compared with day one . " Especially in the intense , 24-hour environment of new motherhood , your learning curve is steep , she explains , and pretty soon no one will know your baby as well as you . " You 'll keep gaining experience . And suddenly you 'll find that even if you had trouble breastfeeding , for example , you could probably teach a class on it now . " 3 You ca n't spoil an infant Every mother hears it from someone , sometime : You 're holding your baby too long , picking him up too much , feeding him too often . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For first-time mom Amber Fowler , whose son was born two and a half months early , these comments were particularly confusing . The Livingston , Montana , mom needed to feed her son as often as he would nurse to help him gain weight . And he wanted to be held , particularly during a flu episode , when , Fowler admits , " I probably had him in my arms for twenty-four hours . " Still , with friends and family advising her to put him down more often and place him on a feeding schedule , she began to worry that she areally was spoiling him . But gradually she realized that her baby 's cries for food and comfort were n't about what he wanted but about what he needed-and she could n't spoil him by meeting his needs . Remembering this helped enormously , she says : " Not only did it help me defend my position to others but it also helped me enjoy what I was doing with him right then . " 4 Do n't take it personally From about the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as regular as the early evening newswhich was around the time she would start crying every night . From then until the latenight talk shows , her mom , Jessica , would sit on a large exercise ball while holding and gently bouncing her baby . " The minute I stopped , she would start to cry again , " remembers Kircher , who lives in Medina , Washington . Whenever she began to feel anxious about her daughter 's colic , Kircher took deep breaths and tried to focus on something else . Sometimes she 'd listen to music or sing to herself and Evelyn . " The key is to avoid watching the clock . And you have to keep reminding yourself that it 's not your fault if your baby cries , " says Kircher . Evelyn 's colic ended about three and a half months later , but Kircher says that by then she had learned two very important lessons : how to stay calm in the face of almost anything and how to recognize that her child 's cries were her responsibility , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense mother gives a baby colic , " says Kircher . " But I do think a mother with a colicky baby does need to learn how to relax in order to survive all that crying herself . " 5 You do n't have to like it , you just have to do it When I was pregnant with Anna , a father of twins turned told me about the wonderful nights he spent dancing with his babies in the moonlight . It seemed so romantic , I almost could n't wait to be up with my own baby . As it turned out , there were a few moments like this , but a year of sleepless nights was much less alluring . Parenting a newborn is hard work-and often not much fun . It only makes it worse if you 're embarrassed about feeling this way . So let yourself off the hook and remind yourself that although you have to take care of your baby , you do n't have to love the chores that go along with that . " You 're not a bad mom because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of raising kids , " says Robert Golenbock , M.D. , a pediatrician with the Center for Pediatric Medicine , in Danbury , Connecticut , and a dad of two . " It 's okay that you are n't happy about it-that has nothing to do with how you really feel about your child . " 6 Listen to others , but trust what you see Like many babies adopted from overseas , Susie Rolander 's 7-month-old-daughter , Liza-Rae , originally from Taiwan , had some developmental delays . " So I had all these specialists telling me what to do and what not to do , " says Rolander . " Pretty soon I started to worry constantly that I was doing everything wrong . " Finally , when Rolander found herself obsessing over Liza-Rae 's weight gain , fueled in part by an offhand comment from a physical therapist , the pediatrician set her straight . " He said , " Just look at her ! She 's fine , ' ' " says Rolander . " Now when I panic about something , I remind myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's smiling , she 's babbling , she 's trying to walk-she 's fine ! " Of course , Rolander still takes into account what the experts say . But she makes sure she gives equal weight to what she herself has observed . Another bonus : Taking a moment to look at how well her daughter is doing is a great confirmation about her own abilities as a mother . 7 Your baby can tell you what she needs Although Jan Riordan is a mom of 6 and a grandmother of 11 , many years ago this professor of nursing at Wichita State University , in Kansas , was just a new mom like any other , with an infant whose cries were difficult to understand . And like many moms , Riordan found herself guessing what they meant . " When my second baby was born , though , I started to see that he gave actual cues when he wanted to be fed or held . That 's when I realized that communication is really a kind of dance between parent and child : One leads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . " Understanding your baby is about being aware of the most subtle of signals . " You see a baby wake up and move his arms and legs , " says Riordan . " Then he starts moving his mouth , and then he breaks into an intermittent crygetting louder until his cries are difficult to ignore . " All throughout , the baby was telling you that he was hungry ; at the end , he was simply shouting the same message . " Babies are in charge of a situation ; they can show you what they want if you 're open to finding out . You just have to be confident that you can learn their language , " she says . Anna is now 7 , and her sister , Kate , is 3 , so the mantras that got me through babyhood are over . But I still talk to myself . My current favorite , when Kate has a rough day : " She 's just being three . " I hope it 'll work when she 's 16 . " Babies can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding out .
