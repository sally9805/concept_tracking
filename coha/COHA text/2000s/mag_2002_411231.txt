Section : Special Report E-Learning Guide There 's high quality online , but it takes real work to find it <p> A decade ago , if you wanted to further your education and keep your job and continue to live in the same house and send your children to the same school , your only decent choices were the universities and community colleges within commuting distance . Never mind which institutions nationwide had the best programs and top professors in your field . You could n't even consider them . Oh , how times have changed . These days , you can still choose between State U. and the local community college , but add to the mix the 2,000-plus institutions , some of the very best in the world , that offer online courses and degrees accessible from anywhere with a computer and a modem . Suddenly , getting ahead in life is a lot easier  --  and a whole lot more complicated . <p> It 's easier because the Internet has kicked learning out of the classroom and into cyberspace , making education available anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Turkey sign up for business degrees from American universities . Working mothers in Denver can squeeze in statistics courses from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania between the workday and family responsibilities . Overachieving high schoolers add college calculus to their secondary-school schedules . Itinerant travelers log in to virtual classrooms whenever and wherever they please . More than 2 million people have taken online courses so far . <p> But the vastness of offerings only makes E-learning more complicated . In the past few years , 70 percent of American universities have put at least one course online , and by 2005 that may grow to 90 percent . The range of schools posting their intellectual wares on the Web is already staggering : from modest Chattanooga State Technical Community College and its 30 courses , to Rochester Institute of Technology 's five bachelor of science degrees , to the University of Illinois 's 10 different master 's programs encompassing 220 courses . The range of fields covered is almost as astounding : While most curricula lean toward business and technology  --  at last count , 600 marketing courses were available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and education programs , to name just a few . <p> Pitfalls . For anyone thinking of jumping into this new education world , the questions present themselves quickly : how to find the right courses or the appropriate programs  --  and how to find quality . The answers lie in understanding a number of issues : How has online education developed , and is it here to stay ? What are the pitfalls in signing up for a course ? Who does this kind of education work best for ? What are the signs of engaging , enriching , and career-building coursework ? ( Helpful answers to these questions can be found in this and the following stories , and in the accompanying U.S. News tables . ) <p> It seems fair to say that distance education has had a checkered past . The correspondence courses at the turn of the 20th century promised the equivalent of " anytime , anywhere " education but instead delivered shoddy lessons and slapdash instruction , driving dropout rates through the roof . But people still wanted to learn from a distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew over Indiana beaming lessons by satellite into Midwestern classrooms . With each new technological innovation  --  telephone , film , radio , audiotapes , and television  --  distance education rebounded . By the 1980s , many colleges were offering courses and programs that taught through correspondence , teleconferencing , videotaped lectures , or some combination of all three . But by the late 1990s , most schools had moved to take the entire experience online . Schools rushed to the Web for a slew of reasons : Some found the possibility of reaching thousands of new students intoxicating , while others wanted to take the lead in developing new educational technology . More than a few thought the dotcom mirage would become a pool of cold , hard cash . Some universities set up their online operations in separate , hoped-for , profit centers . Many were just afraid of being left behind . <p> Still , throughout the history of distance education , critics have questioned whether students could really be taught well from far away . Those concerns have been revived with online education . Detractors worry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster isolation among students , and that they dehumanize the process of learning . E-learning may " inhibit rather than promote good education , " charges the American Federation of Teachers . Faculty fret that online education forces them to surrender control of their academic work to administrators and business people , who will warp it into something profitable . And with the continuing shakeout among E-learning companies and universities ( story , Page 58 ) , students could be left in the untenable position of paying for classes at a school that no longer exists . <p> Despite such worries , online education is here to stay . For some students , it 's their only option . As a service manager with Komatsu Mining Systems , Steve Huff heads off to remote areas for a month at a time . Yet , at 55 , Huff was ready to finish his undergraduate degree . He signed up for the University of Phoenix 's online baccalaureate completion program . For Huff , maintaining a 3.9 grade-point average while logging in from places as far away as Aikhal , Siberia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that difficult . Finding the right program to begin with was the challenge . " There are hundreds out there , " he says . <p> For-profit University of Phoenix , the largest private university in the United States , is an interesting case in point . With campuses in 21 states , the school currently enrolls over 90,000 students . But roughly 25,000 of them have opted for one of the school 's 18 online degrees . At the University of Maryland-University College , the biggest provider of distance education in the nation , students signed up for 44,000 courses last year . The university expects enrollment to triple in the next decade . As if those were n't enough options , several giant companies , like General Motors , are setting up their own online learning centers for their workers . And a host of other for-profit companies have sprung up to capitalize on what is already a multibillion-dollar market worldwide . Businesses such as NETg , Click2learn , Quisic , and SmartForce formed to sell to individuals and corporations discrete modules that instruct students in business practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Indeed , for some E-learning companies the how-to-fire modules turned out to be prescient : UNext has laid off 52 workers , and two months ago , Pensare went under . ) <p> Yet despite the economic tumult , E-learning remains a sturdy industry . " Anybody that says online education is just another promise is ignoring what online education is already doing , " says Bob Kerrey , president of the New School in New York City and former senator from Nebraska . " It 's allowing people to learn in ways that were impossible before . " The models vary greatly . The U.S. Army War College 's two-year program in strategic studies requires book reading , paper writing , and thoughtful Internet discussions among its 300 participants . Meanwhile , Harvard Business Online uses spreadsheets , case studies , and video clips to teach a quick course on finance for managers . With programs like Harvard 's , students can move at their own pace and take time to review lessons . Students do n't just receive information online , say advocates , they wrestle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that online learning can be effective . Thomas Russell of North Carolina State University reviewed research on all types of distance learning and concluded that there was " no significant difference " between inside- and outside-classroom education . The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , which funds the development of university online courses , came to the same conclusion . Says program director Frank Mayadas , " If the same professor is offering the same course and has offered it online and on campus , the results are equivalent and even tend to favor off-campus learning . " Arizona State University compared test results of its online M.B.A . students with those enrolled in the traditional program and found that the online students scored higher . <p> Gold rush . Still , while the formula can be effective , many online courses are not . Some providers , including universities , bypassed educational quality in their rush toward Internet gold . " Much of corporate E-learning is underwhelming , " admits Sam Herring , executive vice president at Lguide , a company that evaluates online education . Indeed , the company reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two that it could recommend . Others promise a high degree of interactivity with the instructor and other students , but few frequent the class chat rooms and the professor does n't return E-mails . Even big-name schools do n't guarantee quality . Brian Dalton , 26 , complains that the professor of the biochemistry course he took through the University of California-Berkeley sometimes did n't answer all the queries in his E-mails . When he did , the response would be cursory . " He did n't want to be bothered with questions , " says Dalton . " I had the feeling that there were lower standards than at the traditional university for the professor 's involvement in the material , answering questions , and grading . " Dalton received an A+ . <p> Successfully venturing into online education , therefore , requires some serious thought . One question worth considering is whether an online program will give you the full breadth of education you seek . While at least 35 institutions offer bachelor 's degrees online , it 's worth noting that much of the four-year college experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet . ( Some places are trying , though : Kentucky Virtual University , for instance , offers virtual college sports and " music to study by " to online students . ) And at the graduate level , skeptics ask whether E-learning can be the proper mode for educating nurses , for instance , or teachers . <p> Real time . The next thing to examine is how you learn best . Because the Internet is so flexible , courses can be created in a variety of shapes and sizes , from streaming-video lectures in real time to instructorless simulations to E-mail-heavy university courses that require students to read books . Students can pick the format that best suits them . " Without question , adjusting to differentiated learning styles is one of the greatest benefits of online learning , " says Carol Vallone , chief executive officer of WebCT , a company that provides the technical backbone for hundreds of universities ' online courses . The company has even developed a program that modifies how content is delivered to different students in the same class based on their learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with peers should consider programs that emphasize communication among instructor , student , and classmates . Indeed , some proponents of online education argue that its ability to foster thoughtful discussion  --  through E-mail , chat rooms , and discussion boards  --  may be the technology 's greatest strength . At the well-regarded Walden University , which has been offering Ph.D . ' s online since 1993 to students some of whom have gone on to teach at Yale University , serve in the Bush administration , and head up companies , faculty prepare weekly discussion topics for chat rooms and participate in extensive E-mail conversations with students . Other schools , like the University of Baltimore , ensure student-professor interaction by requiring students to log on at least three times a week and grading them on their contributions to the discussion boards . At the end of such courses , there can be over 3,000 postings on group discussion boards . For Wendy Sahli , 30 , an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland-University College , getting gobs of individual attention from a professor via E-mail was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional classrooms , class time is precious . With E-mail I feel like I can ask the instructor questions without distracting the other students . " <p> Play hard . Other schools promote student and professorial camaraderie by requiring on-campus visits . Ohio University 's M.B.A . Without Boundaries program mandates four-day weekend visits to the school every three months as well as two-week stints twice in the summer . During these residencies , students complete group projects , take overview classes with professors , and generally get to know one another . " We work hard , play hard , and learn a lot , " says Tom Hammann , a second-year student and full-time business unit manager at General Mills in Lodi , Calif . <p> While communication-based classes can be either synchronous ( students meet at a specific time online for discussions or lectures ) or asynchronous ( students can " attend " class to read notes or participate in conversations anytime they please ) , courses that revolve around solving real-world problems are primarily asynchronous , and often instructorless . Companies like UNext and Cognitive Arts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked with psychologists to develop sophisticated exercises that students work through at their own pace . Their mantra is " learn by doing . " For a Columbia University course in C++ programming developed by Cognitive Arts , students assume the role of entry-level programmers working on a project at a software company . Memos from the " team leader " outline each assignment . As students complete the assignments , they send them to a " personal tutor , " who grades and returns them . There is no teaching in the traditional sense . <p> Unfortunately , courses with little instructor interaction have high dropout rates  --  sometimes over 60 percent . Clark Bryant , 19 , gave up on his online technical writing class at Chattanooga State Technical Community College after less than two weeks . It was boring , he says . " If it just sits there , I wo n't do it . " This fall , he enrolled in the same course on campus . Not everyone is disciplined enough to finish a course without instructor prodding , says Paula Moreira , vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides information-technology training . She admits that only 50 percent of the students who start New Horizons ' self-paced Web courses finish them . However , 90 percent of the students who sign up for video or webcast courses  --  where teachers broadcast lectures and hold discussions in real time  --  complete them , about the same rate as the classroom-based courses . <p> All-stars . One thing has n't changed from traditional education : It 's still up to the teacher to produce a stimulating educational experience . But online instructors are rarely the academic all-stars that some universities brag about . Providers have taken to " unbundling " the professorial role  --  enlisting high-profile professors to design courses while part-time instructors actually " facilitate " the course . " All-star cast " is how Glenn Jones , founder of Jones International University , refers to his school 's faculty . " We bifurcate the teaching process , " Jones says , so that professors from top-notch schools set up the class and decide the syllabus while " teaching faculty , " only about two thirds of whom have Ph.D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools with their own batch of high-quality academics , like Cornell , resort to this method for their online courses . While the teachers could be talented instructors  --  and often have real-world experience in the field they 're teaching  --  students hoping to learn from their discipline 's top theorists might be disappointed . Even courses taught by well-meaning professors face problems if there are too many students in the class because the instructors ca n't keep up with E-mail traffic . When Walt Coker , who teaches education courses for Northern Arizona University Online , has more than 40 students in a class , he 'll often receive more than 300 E-mails each day . " I will try to have a response within 48 hours , " he says , but sometimes he just ca n't do it . <p> As with on-campus education , students need to ensure that they 'll have enough institutional support to finish their degree . Indeed , online providers are only slowly realizing the importance of student services . " People take it for granted on a campus that they can ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Center for Academic Transformation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y . Experienced , good-quality schools , she says , offer mentoring , librarians , and technical help online , not only at 3 in the afternoon but at 3 a.m. as well . Rio Salado Community College in Tempe , Ariz. , offers a service called " beep a tutor " : Students can E-mail academic questions to a pager-toting tutor who will call them back within a few hours . The school 's tutoring center and library also host live chat rooms on the Web . <p> Luckily , there are some shortcuts to finding a good online program . One way to find the best is to limit your search to providers approved by one of the six regional accrediting bodies , the association of the specific field you plan to study , or a state agency . Accreditation assures you that the institution has qualified faculty , sophisticated instructional materials , and a well-stocked library . However , as with all things Internet , the situation is more complicated than it appears : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quality . For example , the University of Phoenix mainly employs adjunct teachers . That means the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business wo n't give the stamp of approval to its M.B.A . program , but the National League for Nursing passed its nursing program because that organization does not require a staff of tenured , full-time faculty . <p> But can an online education truly compare to learning in the classroom ? Even some online boosters say no . " The closer you are to Socrates , " says Bob Scales , CEO of Walden University , " the farther you should be from distance learning . " Carol Twigg of the Center for Academic Transformation disagrees : It 's the classroom that 's inadequate , she argues . " That 's where one size fits all .
