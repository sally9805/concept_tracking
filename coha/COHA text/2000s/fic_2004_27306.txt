Chapter One PARIS NORD SUNDAY , MAY 2 , 2004 12:00 P.M. In the darkness , he touched her arm and said , " Stay here . " She did not move , just waited . The smell of salt water was strong . She heard the faint gurgle of water . Then the lights came on , reflecting off the surface of a large open tank , perhaps fifty meters long and twenty meters wide . It might have been an indoor swimming pool , except for all the electronic equipment that surrounded it . And the very strange device at the far end of the pool . Jonathan Marshall came back to her , grinning like an idiot . " Qu'estce que tu penses ? " he said , though he knew his pronunciation was terrible . " What do you think ? " " It is magnificent , " the girl said . When she spoke English , her accent sounded exotic . In fact , everything about her was exotic , Jonathan thought . With her dark skin , high cheekbones , and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she strutted like a model in her short skirt and spike heels . She was half Vietnamese , and her name was Marisa . " But no one else is here ? " she said , looking around . " No , no , " he said . " It 's Sunday . No one is coming . " Jonathan Marshall was twenty-four , a graduate student in physics from London , working for the summer at the ultra-modern Laboratoire Ondulatoire-the wave mechanics laboratory-of the French Marine Institute in Vissy , just north of Paris . But the suburb was mostly the residence of young families , and ithad been a lonely summer for Marshall . Which was why he could not believe his good fortune at meeting this girl . This extraordinarily beautiful and sexy girl . " Show me what it does , this machine , " Marisa said . Her eyes were shining . " Show me what it is you do . " " My pleasure , " Marshall said . He moved to the large control panel and began to switch on the pumps and sensors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of the tank clicked , one after another . He glanced back at her , and she smiled at him . " It is so complicated , " she said . She came and stood beside him at the control panel . " Your research is recorded on cameras ? " " Yes , we have cameras in the ceiling , and on the sides of the tank . They make a visual record of the waves that are generated . We also have pressure sensors in the tanks that record pressure parameters of the passing wave . " " These cameras are on now ? " " No , no , " he said . " We do n't need them ; we 're not doing an experiment . " " Perhaps we are , " she said , resting her hand on his shoulder . Her fingers were long and delicate . She had beautiful fingers . She watched for a minute , then said , " This room , everything is so expensive . You must have great security , no ? " " Not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . And only one security camera . " He gestured over his shoulder . " That one back in the corner . " She turned to look . " And that is turned on ? " she said . " Oh yes , " he said . " That 's always on . " She slid her hand to caress his neck lightly . " So is someone watching us now ? " " Afraid so . " " Then we should behave . " " Probably . Anyway , what about your boyfriend ? " " Him . " She gave a derisive snort . " I have had enough of him . " Earlier that day , Marshall had gone from his small apartment to the caf on rue Montaigne , the caf he went to every morning , taking a journal article with him to read as usual . Then this girl had sat down at the next table , with her boyfriend . The couple had promptly fallen into an argument . In truth , Marshall felt that Marisa and the boyfriend did n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-faced fellow built like a footballer , with longish hair and wire-frame glasses that did not suit his thick features . He looked like a pig trying to appear scholarly . His name was Jim , and he was angry with Marisa , apparently because she had spent the previous night away from him . " I do n't know why you wo n't tell me where you were , " he kept repeating . " It is none of your business , that 's why . " " But I thought we were going to have dinner together . " " Jimmy , I told you we were not . " " No , you told me you were . And I was waiting at the hotel for you . All night . " " So ? No one made you . You could go out . Enjoy yourself . " " But I was waiting for you . " " Jimmy , you do not own me . " She was exasperated by him , sighing , throwing up her hands , or slapping her bare knees . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . " I do as I please . " " That 's clear . " " Yes , " she said , and at that moment she turned to Marshall and said , " What is that you are reading ? It looks very complicated . " At first Marshall was alarmed . She was clearly talking to him to taunt the boyfriend . He did not want to be drawn into the couple 's dispute . " It 's physics , " he said briefly , and turned slightly away . He tried to ignore her beauty . " What kind of physics ? " she persisted . " Wave mechanics . Ocean waves . " " So , you are a student ? " " Graduate student . " " Ah . And clearly intelligent . You are English ? Why are you in France ? " And before he knew it , he was talking to her , and she introduced the boyfriend , who gave Marshall a smirk and a limp handshake . It was still very uncomfortable , but the girl behaved as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What sort of work ? A tank with a machine ? Really , I ca n't imagine what you say . Will you show me ? " And now they were here , in the wave mechanics laboratory . And Jimmy , the boyfriend , was sulking in the parking lot outside , smoking a cigarette . " What shall we do about Jimmy ? " she said , standing beside Marshall while he worked at the control panel . " He ca n't smoke in here . " " I will see that he does not . But I do n't want to make him more angry .
