<p> A Perfect Circle , <p> Mars Volta <p> *8 tonight <p> *UIC Pavilion , 1150 W. Harrison <p> *Tickets , $35 <p> * ( 312 ) 559-1212 <p> Comprised of veterans of Tool ( singer Maynard James Keenan ) , the Smashing Pumpkins ( guitarist James Iha ) and Marilyn Manson ( bassist Jeordie White a.k.a . Twiggy Ramirez ) , plus stellar drummer for hire Josh Freese , A Perfect Circle is easily written off as a gathering of post-alternative superstars joining together to have a little fun of the moody , fog-shrouded , gothic/industrial variety . <p> In fact , the group , which is touring in support of its second album , " Thirteenth Step , " is driven by the vision and commitment of its least celebrated or famous member , guitarist Billy Howerdel , who started his career working as a roadie for the likes of Nine Inch Nails and David Bowie before trading his role backstage for one in the spotlight . <p> I spoke to Howerdel about the enigmatic band following its European and Asian tours and before the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pavilion tonight . <p> Q. I 'm fascinated with your history , coming from behind the stage and moving front and center . What did you learn from working behind the scenes ? <p> A. Definitely internalizing my choices ; it 's hard not to follow through with it then . Not having too many yes men around . When you have a lot of money and too many yes men , you do n't do anything except what you want to do . <p> Q. You need to have someone around to say when something is a bad idea ? <p> A. Yeah . Good ideas and bad taste is a bad combination . You have to have someone around you that you really trust . But , um , financial things  --  picking the right management and lawyers , all that kind of stuff . I would hear different things when I was working as a roadie , and I think it just becomes second nature to do the right thing . <p> Q. Talk about your " School of Rock " ! <p> A. People say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . It sounds so cliched , but at the time , my heart was there . I really wanted to be a guitar tech , and I could n't get myself away from the guitar long enough to do any other job . I started getting into the music industry through stage lighting . When I started playing guitar and getting into it , I was about 18 years old , and I loved being around music . So I became a guitar tech . My Dad always said , " Do n't go to college . Be a blue-collar guy . Be a carpenter , a plumber  --  a trade you can always fall back on . " So I had that ideal in mind and was looking forward to doing something with my hands . Being a guitar tech made sense . <p> I was always interested in writing music , and I did it on the road . While everyone else was out partying , I pretty much would just have a studio in my hotel and say goodnight and go work on music all night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did on the road all over the world . A piece here and there  --  six lines written in Australia and a guitar line in France . So it has this history to me ; it 's almost like a diary . In that way , it is very personal . <p> Q. When do you know a song is a keeper ? <p> A. It takes a long time . I just keep going until I do n't hate it . But also , I try not to make it too good . It 's kind of a Buddhist thing , but I like being comfortable with uncertainty , being able to let go and not try to polish it too much . And I see what other people have to offer from there . I think collaboration is really important . <p> Q. That leads me to the question of whether A Perfect Circle is a real band . People always wonder if it 's a genuine collaboration or just a side-project supergroup . <p> A. This band as it is now , I could n't be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realist . The first band was great , but this band is really great , and I hope it stays together in its current lineup . It was set up with the parameters of , " Maynard 's in Tool , and he is going to leapfrog between the bands . " When he is available again and these guys are n't , we are going to have to go to plan C. It would be great if it is the same , and it could be great if it 's not . But in terms of this feeling like a band , it really feels more like a band than ever in a lot of ways . I really like it , but again , I do n't want to get heartbroken . So I always say , if it works out , great . If not ... <p> Q. Billy Corgan has been making some news lately by throwing a lot of venom toward James Iha and criticizing A Perfect Circle . How do you feel about that ? <p> A. It 's unfortunate . It sounds like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is kind of reaching  --  kind of desperate . We read it . It was funny , but then the realization came that I sympathize with the guy because it sounds like he is really sad . I 'm sure James is affected by it , even though he says he 's O.K. But I 'm sure he 's affected by it , because anyone would be . Corgan is obviously sick and has a lot of problems and probably has seven therapists telling him seven different things . Hopefully he will work himself out . Billy Corgan is a great songwriter and a great musician , but let 's just keep it at that . <p> Q. When musicians create this larger than life persona , they can sometimes get trapped by it . You 're operating under a different kind of model , sort of like Pink Floyd , where the members of the band are more or less anonymous . <p> A. Everyone has their different styles , and some people 's talents are stronger than others . My stronger talent is writing music , but socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking the red carpet and everything . I 'm not going to take away from Jeordie , but he 's much more charming and came from that school and Marilyn Manson . He 's much more capable of entertaining . You know , everybody has their talents , and that is what I like about this band . There are a lot of different dynamics that make us , as a whole , pretty strong . It 's pretty unpredictable . I can see that the perception of the band is pretty dark , and shrouded silhouettes on stage , but there is so much dumb , borderline potty humor that happens when we are onstage . It seems so disjointed , but it is who we are , and there is no hiding it . <p> Q. Some people hear " Thirteenth Step " as a concept album . Any thoughts on that ? <p> A. I put the music out there for Maynard to respond to , and whatever he is currently thinking and feeling at the time is what he will put on it in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a conversation with different people . I hear a thread through this album . It probably is more of a concept album than he or anyone else would like to admit , but it definitely deals with addiction . Whenever you say concept album , people say , " Oh , are you trying to redo ' The Wall , ' you pretentious jerks ? " But the fact is , there is a thread that goes throughout the record  --  a lot of pain and personal things that we do n't even know . There is addiction around us in all forms , whether it is power , ego , drugs or sex , and there is plenty of inspiration to draw from , especially in L.A. <p> Pop Music Critic Jim DeRogatis co-hosts " Sound Opinions , " the world 's only rock ' n ' roll talk show , at 11 p.m .
