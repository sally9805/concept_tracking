1 I knew what was coming as soon as he handed me the teddy bear . White and fluffy , clutching a little red satin heart , this was the harbinger of Kevin 's marriage proposal . No matter how I wanted to deny it , I knew , deep in the pit of my stomach , that the moment of truth had finally arrived . " I have a surprise for you , " he murmured , sitting down next to me on the inn 's lace-canopied bed and pressing the bear into my hands . " Oh ... " I conjured up a shaky smile and tried to gaze at the bear with a reasonable facsimile of adoring , childlike whimsy . " It 's so ... cute .

The room started to spin . Snip . The heart burst open , spilling polyurethane stuffing and a diamond ring into my lap . Before I had time to put together an appropriate response , he dropped to one knee and slipped the ring onto my finger . " Rebecca June Davis , I love you and I 'll love you forever . Will you marry me ? " I looked at his face , bathed in hope and pride . I looked at our suitcases by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the bed-and-breakfast for three more days . And then I looked at the ring , already on my finger , and said the only thing I could say : " Um . Yes ? " Continues ...
