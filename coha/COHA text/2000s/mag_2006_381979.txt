Before he is put to death , Saddam Hussein will be allowed one last phone call . He will be given a glass of water , a moment to pray and an opportunity to make a statement about his life and crimes . The entire event will be recorded on video to be stored in the Iraqi government archives . Then his neck will be slipped into the noose of a 2-in. - thick hemp rope . A few moments later , his life will end . <P> That 's how recent executions have proceeded in Iraq  --  at least when the equipment works . Since the Iraqi government reintroduced capital punishment in 2004 , several executions have been beset by glitches and logistical snafus . At first , executioners used an old rope left over from Saddam 's regime that stretched too much to break the condemned 's neck ; it sometimes took as long as eight minutes for the hanged to die . New ropes brought in for later executions jerked harder on the convicted person 's spine , but executioners soon noticed the cords fraying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling of the gallows . During a recent round of executions , on Sept. 6 , the rope snapped after 12 hangings , sending a condemned man plummeting 15 ft. through the trap door onto the hard concrete floor below . Miraculously , he survived . " Allah saved me ! " he shouted . " Allah saved me ! " For 40 minutes , prison guards , officials and witnesses engaged in heated arguments over whether or not to interpret the broken rope as divine intervention . <P> It may not be an efficient process , but the death penalty is back in vogue in Iraq . After the U.S. invasion , capital punishment was suspended by L. Paul Bremer , head of the now-defunct Coalition Provisional Authority , but interim Prime Minster Iyad Allawi reinstated it a year later . Since September 2005 , when three men were hanged in the southwestern city of Kut after being convicted of running a murder-and-kidnapping ring , the Iraqi government has executed 50 prisoners convicted of murder or kidnapping , says spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh . An adviser to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more batches of 14 or 15 each " in the coming months . Al-Maliki told the BBC last week that Saddam too could be hanged " before the end of the year . " For the beleaguered Iraqi government , the practice of executions plays a political role as well as a legal one : amid the inescapable violence on Iraq 's streets , the death penalty plays well with Iraqis tired of seeing gangs commit murder with impunity . " From the Iraqi point of view , " says al-Maliki 's adviser , " they do n't like to see a lot of people get killed every day and have a low number of executions . " <P> And yet an examination of the way the death penalty is administered in Iraq casts doubt on the government 's candor about the frequency of executions , and that raises questions about whether justice is being flouted in Iraq 's rush to execute . According to an Iraqi official involved in coordinating executions , the hanging rope has been used more extensively than has been publicly acknowledged by the Iraqi government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and March 2006 , says the official , who attended all three sets of hangings . When the additional executions are taken into account , according to an official in the Prime Minister 's office who declined to give an exact number , approximately 90 have been executed , almost double the officially declared tally .
