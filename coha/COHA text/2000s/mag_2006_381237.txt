Presidential elections in Mexico used to be as sleepy as they were preordained , the product of 71 years of one-party rule that ended in 2000 . But when Mexicans go to the polls on July 2 , few will gripe that this campaign has been too quiet . The front runner , former Mexico City Mayor Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador , of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party , has turned his rallies into carnival-style events , with supporters tossing marigold garlands around his neck and hoisting cages with squawking chachalaca birds that wear his opponents ' names . To a raucous throng last week in Puebla , south of Mexico City , Lpez pledged to rid the government of the " arrogant , mediocre , lying thieves who cripple this country ! " That got the crowd worked up even more . <P> It all may sound like populist theatrics , but it 's working : polls show Lpez with a slight lead over Felipe Caldern , of the conservative National Action Party . ( By law , President Vicente Fox can not run again . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may have an impact on Americans as well as on the campesinos in Puebla . Mexico 's economy is still in the clutches of Big Business barons , who often pay subsistence wages , hog bank credit and investment capital and choke financial oxygen from the medium-size and small businesses that employ two-thirds of Mexico 's workers . Half of Mexico 's 106 million people live in poverty , yet the country also has 10 billionaires . And economists say chronic disparity is contributing to the U.S. 's population of illegal immigrants : since 2000 , Mexican migration to the U.S. has surged 25% . <P> Lpez , 52 , has cast himself as the champion of Mexico 's have-nots , promising to " keep our young people from having to abandon their towns and families for the other side of the border . " A former social worker , he lives in an austere Mexico City apartment . He says he will steer resources to small businesses and end tax and regulatory breaks enjoyed by large corporations . He also wants to review the North American Free Trade Agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cheap food imports . " For once , " Lpez told TIME , " we 're going to confront the great sin of the Mexican economic system  --  that it does n't create jobs . " <P> But critics also say Lpez has a self-righteous streak that colors his campaign , such as when he refused to take part in the first presidential debate . The Harvard-educated Caldern , 43 , has run negative ads that equate Lpez with Latin America 's left-wing bogeyman , Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez , and he charges that Lpez 's social welfare agenda will jeopardize the nation 's decade-long economic recovery and return Mexico to the debt nightmares of its past . <P> Such tactics have helped the uninspiring Caldern close Lpez 's once-sizable lead in the polls , although he suffered a setback this month when Lpez disclosed that while Caldern was Fox 's Energy Secretary , his brother-in-law received a piata of lucrative federal contracts . Says political analyst Sergio Aguayo : " The fact that Lpez is daring to come to the presidency without his hands tied by privileged interests is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powerful people .
