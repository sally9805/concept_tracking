Ultrafast lasers give power tools a new edge <p> Andrei V. Rode did n't flinch recently when enough power to run 2,000 homes blasted his fingertip . Although staccato bursts of laser light vaporized tiny dots of his flesh , he kept his finger in harm 's way . Rode , a physicist at Australian National University in Canberra , was testing something he 'd been told : That the lasers he works with blast materials in such a novel way that they can evaporate his tissue without any pain . <p> As the cut in his finger deepened and he felt no discomfort , Rode became convinced . When the blood started to flow , he yanked his finger away . His experiment had given him a first-hand experience of a remarkable physical process that physicists first stumbled upon several years ago . <p> At that time , scientists had just developed the means of creating light pulses of unprecedented brevity but enormous power . They had also found that , by a never-before-seen interaction between light and matter , those pulses were damaging the very laser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the total annihilation of a chunk of matter with virtually no effect on the material surrounding it . <p> Investigators found that holes made by the speedy lasers looked preternaturally round . Likewise , where the beams made cuts through a material such as aluminum , the edges looked oddly untouched , with no slag , burrs , cracks , or other signs that something had blasted out the atoms just nanometers away . <p> Although lasers had long been used for machining , none had ever worked materials so cleanly or with such finesse . " The physics of the process is dramatically different , " says Michael D. Perry of General Atomics in San Diego . <p> Laser researchers quickly realized that one of the most powerful and precise devices ever invented for sculpting materials might be in their hands . At once both delicate and brutal , the pulses can bore holes as small as a few hundred nanometers across . Ultrafast beams " slice through diamond like butter , " Perry says . Yet biomedical specialists can also use them as super-accurate scalpels for vision-correcting operations-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ME UP . . . AND AWAY Physicists have studied how lasers damage surfaces since the 1960s . When a laser pulse strikes , the rippling electric and magnetic fields of its light waves shake any unattached electrons back and forth . Ordinarily , those electrons bump into nearby atoms and pass their energy to them as heat , which on a microscopic scale is the mechanical vibration of atoms . This heat can vaporize the material that the laser beam hits . <p> However , a pulse lasting 10-trillionths of a second or more , which is long by laser standards , can have a more widespread effect . The sudden , thermal expansion of the irradiated material can launch a damaging shock wave into the surroundings . <p> That 's not all . Excess heat also surges beyond the irradiated region , and it singes , melts , or otherwise alters material on the perimeter . <p> By the mid 1990s , scientists were building powerful lasers whose pulses were measured not in billionths or even trillionths of seconds but in thousandths of trillionths of seconds , or femtoseconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , there are more femtoseconds than there have been hours since the universe began roughly 14 billion years ago . The new lasers became variously known as ultrashort-pulse lasers , ultrafast lasers , or simply as femtosecond lasers . <p> In the lingo of physics , a device 's power is greater the quicker it transfers energy . So , even a bench-top laser that delivers only enough energy per short pulse to excite a few water molecules can still be astonishingly powerful . Because their pulses are so brief , some of the new , femtosecond lasers are rated equal-for a fleeting instant-to all the world 's power plants put together . <p> When scientists looked at the damage caused by such pulses , they saw surprisingly clean , crisp cuts and holes-unlike anything they 'd previously observed in laser interactions with matter . <p> What was happening , they realized , was that electrons energized by the pulse were knocking other electrons loose , and those , in turn , were quickly freeing up yet more electrons . However , this cascade of electron release was taking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms as heat . <p> Next , because the newly freed electrons electrically repelled each other , they exploded away from the surface . In turn , that outsurge of negative particles pulled along , by electrostatic attraction , the positively charged ionized atoms that had been created by the cascade of electron liberation . <p> Before heat or shock waves could propagate into the surroundings , the laser-blasted material had vanished . <p> PRECISION WORK Since the discovery of this novel destructive process , researchers have rushed to take advantage of it . Automakers and heavy-equipment manufacturers , for instance , are investigating the lasers ' use as tools for drilling better fuel injectors for engines . However , a veil of secrecy shrouds that and many other works in progress . " A lot of that stuff just is n't talked about , " notes femtosecond-laser scientist Peter P. Pronko of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . <p> A notable exception is a system built and used by IBM . Ultrashort-pulse laser processing now serves a vital function in the manufacture of every microchip that the electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microcircuit-production process , chipmakers project light through stencil-like masks to create microscopic patterns in a light-sensitive coating on the chip . The finer the detail in those mask patterns , which are printed in chromium on thin plates of glass , the more electronic components can be crammed onto a tiny fleck of silicon . <p> Richard A. Haight , Peter Longo , and Alfred Wagner of IBM 's Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights , N.Y . have developed a femtosecond-laser-based system that knocks out mask-destroying spots of misplaced chromium . Earlier systems that used nanosecond lasers to clean up those spots sometimes spattered chromium onto other parts of the mask or pitted its glass . " The problem was you could cause more defects than you were correcting , " Haight says . <p> The new mask-repair system focuses its laser to a finer spot size than an earlier version did and therefore can make more precise corrections . In use since the beginning of the year , the device corrects defects in virtually all the photomasks IBM makes-thousands per year . Haight described the device at the Optical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 2 . <p> Because cutting by femtosecond lasers propagates almost no heat , the beams can safely slice through most high explosives , researchers at Lawrence Livermore ( Calif . ) National Laboratory have found . Longer-pulse lasers ignite the materials . Livermore 's Frank Roeske says that femtosecond lasers have promise as a cold process for dismantling retired rockets , artillery shells , and other weapons . <p> Besides leaving adjoining material structurally intact , femtosecond-laser pulses do n't provoke chemical changes . This noninvasive aspect of femtosecond lasers may lead to an improved type of stent , a medical device that holds open plaque-choked arteries . <p> Biodegradable stents can prevent the now common problem of arteries renarrowing some time after an operation that unclogs them . However , mechanical tools are too rough to cut stents from delicate biodegradable polymer tubes , and long-pulse lasers melt or spoil the biocompatibility of the material . New experiments show that femtosecond lasers can slice through the fragile polymer without altering its critical biochemical properties , Thorsten Bauer of Laser Zentrum Hannover ( LZH ) in Germany and his colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif. , last January . <p> An even lighter touch is evident in recent work that demonstrates the femtosecond laser 's potential for gene therapy . In the July 18 Nature , Uday K. Tirlapur and Karsten Knig of Friedrich Schiller University in Jena , Germany , described vaporizing tiny spots in the membranes of rodent cells immersed in a solution containing the gene for a fluorescent protein . The cells quickly repaired the holes-but not before the genes had apparently sneaked in , yielding cells that appeared normal except for their green glow . <p> INSIDE JOB While the brevity of femtosecond-laser pulses makes them remarkably accurate tools for machining , that 's only half the story . Because of their extraordinary intensities-the high number of photons per second they can concentrate into a small area-the pulses also affect materials that are transparent . <p> In clear substances such as diamond and corneal tissue , most electrons are locked up in chemical bonds . Unless a photon has enough energy to liberate an electron , the light wo n't be absorbed . The lack of free electrons prevents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , in a femtosecond-laser pulse , the photons are so densely crammed together that bound electrons are likely to get hit by two or more photons at once . Suddenly , there 's plenty of energy for booting electrons out of atoms , and the material no longer lets the light pass through . <p> By focusing the beam to a certain depth , laser operators can choose how far inside a transparent material the pulse should penetrate before it exceeds the threshold at which multiphoton ionization kicks in . Then , the process quickly sparks an electron avalanche vaporizing everything within the laser spot . " You can actually machine inside a material and not affect its surface at all , " says Duncan P. Hand of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh . <p> In experiments demonstrating how potent this multiphoton ionization can be , researchers have carved cavities into the diamonds used as the jaws of materials squeezing anvils for high-pressure experiments . Ho-Kwang Mao of the Carnegie Institution of Washington ( D.C. ) says he aims to insert electronic sensors inside those cavities to improve measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing ways of exploiting multiphoton ionization in fields ranging from telecommunications to ophthalmology . For example , Philippe Bado and his coworkers at the start-up company Translume in Ann Arbor , Mich. , have developed a technique for using the femtosecond laser pulses to make optical components for sensors and telecommunications . A prototype machine vaporizes channels within domino-size blocks of glass . Longer pulses would deliver too much energy , cracking the glass , Bado says . <p> When the vapor resolidifies , the channels have slightly altered optical properties compared to the surrounding glass . Because of that mismatch , the channel becomes a waveguide , conducting light like an optical fiber . Waveguides increasingly carry out important functions in communications networks , such as receiving multiple wavelengths of light in one channel and sending them out along separate paths , Bado says . <p> In a medical application that requires cutting transparent tissues , femtosecond lasers are finding use in the vision-correcting procedure known as LASIK . In the conventional operation , doctors cut open a flap of tissue at the front of the eye with a scalpel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use nanosecond-pulsed lasers to smoothly shape the underlying corneal tissue . <p> By making that first cut instead with a femtosecond laser , surgeons can both make a more accurately shaped flap and also reduce the chance of certain post-surgical complications , says Ronald M. Kurtz of the University of California , Irvine . Those complications include tissue abrasions and excessively thin flaps that wrinkle up . <p> To make the slice , the femtosecond laser points directly into the patient 's eye and moves in a spiral pattern . During that motion , it blasts thousands of tiny spherical cavities in the cornea , all along the same plane . Perforated by the many bubbles , the clear flesh separates at that plane and can be folded back . <p> In the past year , Intralase of Irvine , Calif. , a company cofounded by Kurtz , has sold about 40 femtolaser systems to clinics nationwide . They have used the devices to perform more than 20,000 procedures , Kurtz says . <p> Eventually , femtosecond lasers may be used for all phases of LASIK surgery , says LZH 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company Carl Zeiss Meditec of Jena , Germany , have developed a system that fires shorter , less energetic pulses along a novel cutting trajectory . By creating smaller bubbles , the new system makes such smooth slices that it could both cut the flap and shape the underlying cornea , Lubatschowski claims . The researchers plan to start clinical studies early next year . <p> HARD FUTURE Femtosecond lasers are delicate enough for eye surgery because their high-power , but low-energy pulses only take little nips of materials . For instance , when Rode did his finger-blasting experiment , the laser firing a thousand times per second took nearly 30 seconds to draw blood . For machining harder materials , today 's femtosecond lasers are even slower . <p> For example , in a recent study of the lasers ' potential for dentistry , Rode and his colleagues found that ultrafast pulses could remove bits of tooth without affecting surrounding material . The researchers expect ultrafast-laser dentistry to be painless and protect nearby healthy enamel . <p> However , the removal rate has to speed up by a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical drills , Rode says . The team reported its findings in the Aug. 15 Journal of Applied Physics . <p> Laser specialists say that other promising uses of femtosecond lasers , such as drilling fuel-injector nozzles in steel , are being held back because today 's lasers are too slow and too costly . However , laser makers report that they 're developing even better designs that may soon make it possible to boost the pulse rate 100- to 1,000-fold and to make simpler , more reliable units . " In the near future , these systems will be getting much smaller and less expensive , " Lubatschowski predicts . <p> Once that happens , many more items in the world-from teeth to car engines-are going to get blasted into better shape , tiny bit by tiny bit . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : CHANGE THE CHANNEL - An ultrafast-pulse laser cuts a clean channel ( left ) in aluminum whereas a longer pulsed laser causes melting and irregular solidification of the metal ( right ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : FOLLOW ME - Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel of modified glass created by extremely brief , intense laser pulses . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : LASER LACE - This biodegradable polymer stent cut by an ultrafast laser expands inside a clogged artery to prop it open and improve blood flow . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : PHOTON DRILL - Ultrafast laser pulses unleash bursts ( blue flashes ) of ionized tooth tissue . <p> By Peter Weiss <p>
