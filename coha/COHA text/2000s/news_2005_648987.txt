<p> THE sun is dazzling , the trade winds are blowing , and the sea spray is tingling my toes . My husband is captaining a tiny Hobie catamaran skimming over the crystal-clear Caribbean , with only me for crew . The rest of our family is scattered across a vast waterfront playground : our older son is windsurfing , our younger son is tubing , our daughter is paddling a kayak . My parents race around the harbor in a Hunter 216 sloop , heeling sharply as their sails swell with the breeze . <p> We are on a three-generation holiday vacation and everyone is happy . <p> This is something of a miracle . <p> Previous attempts to satisfy an adventuresome group ranging in age from 7 to 72 have often gone awry . One holiday we visited an Austrian-style lodge in Vermont , where the downhill slopes were bare . My parents tried cross-country skiing but my children balked ; they preferred to play Parcheesi and listen to lederhosen-clad hotel staff members sing Christmas carols . <p> During a frigid spring trip to Florida we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course closed to kids ; we spent our afternoons at the local outlet mall . Suffice it to say that we have never been to the same destination twice  --  and have even left in advance of our planned departure date . <p> Yet the laid-back charm of the Bitter End Yacht Club has captivated us all . This sprawling property stretches along a mile of white sand beach on the North Sound of Virgin Gorda , considered one of the most unspoiled and secluded deep-water harbors in the Caribbean . The Bitter End acts as a base camp for water-sports enthusiasts , with a fleet of more than 100 boats , along with daily snorkeling excursions , scuba diving outings and fishing charters . The resort also caters to visiting yachts and ships ; cruisers can dock or pick up a mooring , then come ashore to shop and dine . <p> The Bitter End bills itself a " rollicking nautical village " and it is indeed a nonstop hub of activity  --  although not the usual activity associated with expensive Caribbean vacations . There is no golf or tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no TV or Internet hookup in the rooms . There is no room service . There are no blow dryers or irons supplied in rooms  --  instead , guests in the resort 's 77 suites and villas are greeted with free bottles of bug spray and Mount Gay rum . <p> There are also no roads  --  the Bitter End is accessible only by boat . Most guests fly to San Juan , then take a half-hour puddle jumper to Beef Island Airport on Tortola , followed by a 45-minute ferry to the resort . <p> The Bitter End  --  so named as the last outpost of civilization before the open waters of the Atlantic  --  was first developed in the 1950 's by Basil Symonette , a British yachtsman who built a shorefront pub and several cottages for charter captains . In the early 1970 's , the Hokin family of Chicago bought it as a private family retreat . They gradually expanded it into a self-contained complex . The Hokins continue to control the Bitter End , although in January they sold an interest to the Grand Heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain the resort 's rustic feel . <p> Upon arrival , guests receive a bamboo folder full of information on the Bitter End 's programs . Included in weekly packages are day trips to destinations such as Norman Island ( supposedly Robert Louis Stevenson 's inspiration for Treasure Island ) and the Baths , a set of massive boulders forming grottoes and caves . Our favorite was Anegada , a sparsely-inhabited atoll with an open-air restaurant serving succulent fresh lobster . Guests can also sign up for hourlong guided snorkeling tours of local coral reefs , or for sunset cruises aboard the Paranda , the resort 's 48-foot catamaran . <p> The Bitter End 's highlight , for most visitors , is the unlimited use of an endless variety of vessels : large and small sailboats , dinghies , kayaks , windsurfers , kite boards , rowing shells and more . <p> Cheerful young members of the staff at the water-sports desk provide maps of the North Sound , with suggested routes around Prickly Pear Island , Saba Rock and Necker Island ( owned by Sir Richard Branson ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom and dockside demonstration , or sign up for a series of lessons at the Nick Trotter Sailing and Windsurfing School . There 's also a scuba shop , Kilbride 's , which offers certification courses and schedules daily dives . <p> During holiday weeks , the Bitter End runs a free kids ' camp from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m . During our stay , the energetic and experienced counselors supervised sailing , tubing and kayaking ; they also ran swimming races , diving contests and arts and crafts programs . They even were hosts to a Parents ' Night Off , where they took a pontoon boat of kids out for a sunset cruise , then to dinner and a movie ( all on the resort 's premises ) . <p> By 4 p.m. the waterfront closes , and a steady parade of resort guests and visitors browses among the resort 's shops , mingling and swapping stories of the high seas . Families can be found at the freshwater pool , adjacent to a recreation area with a tetherball set and bocce court . Die-hard gym buffs hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rusty pile of weights and benches in its center . ( Memo to Grand Heritage : start the renovations here . ) <p> All Bitter End weekly packages include a full meal plan . The Clubhouse serves breakfast , lunch and dinner in a casual waterfront setting with colorful burgees fluttering in the breeze . The Carvery has lavish themed buffets several nights a week . The Pub and the Poolside Bar serve burgers , salads and sandwiches throughout the afternoon . While none of the food was outstanding  --  and much was repetitious  --  meals were fresh and filling . The children 's menu features chicken nuggets , pizza and pasta . <p> At dusk , when the harbor twinkles with rigging lights , the night life gets going . Forget quiet dining in a serene setting ; most evenings feature entertainment by the Reflections , the Bitter End 's own steel band , or the Latitude Stars , a local reggae-calypso band . If you 're not up for steel drums and limbo dancing , visit the Bitter End 's open-air theater , the Sand Palace , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story " and " Pirates of the Caribbean . " Or hang out at the Clubhouse bar , sipping Painkillers and Bushwackers , the resort 's signature drinks . <p> The Bitter End has two sets of accommodations . The recently renovated North Sound Suites , nestled in the hills , feature air-conditioning , private decks and panoramic views . Our unit had rattan furnishings , batik fabrics and a clever indoor-outdoor shower surrounded by palms , bougainvillea and cactus . The Beachfront Villas  --  now being renovated  --  have ceiling fans , hammocks and wrap-around verandas . Guests can climb a network of wooden stairs to their rooms , or hitch a ride with the chauffeured motorized carts that roam the resort . The higher your perch , the better your view  --  but the more you have to rely on the staff to get you to and from your room . <p> Our week at the Bitter End flew by in a flash . On the last day , all three generations agreed to participate in a regatta . My husband raced with my younger son , my older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my parents raced with a couple they met on the beach . I slathered myself in sunscreen , hopped into a skiff and snapped photos to document a family vacation we could n't wait to repeat . <p> WHERE TO BEGIN <p> The Bitter End Yacht Club is on the northern tip of Virgin Gorda , in the British Virgin Islands . Getting there requires flying to Beef Island Airport on Tortola ; most United States passengers arrive via San Juan .
