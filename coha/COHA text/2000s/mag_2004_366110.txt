Rules of engagement . That 's code for what U.S. soldiers are allowed to do on the battlefield , and it 's never simple . So when troops prepped for the invasion of Fallujah , a city filled with rebels without uniforms , their commanders warned them they could shoot only armed men . But the brass also told them they could shoot first and ask questions later . Maddeningly , both orders made sense , depending , as the worn caveat goes , on the circumstances . <P> On Nov. 13 , a freelance photojournalist working for NBC videotaped a Marine shooting first , apparently killing a wounded Iraqi lying on the floor of a Fallujah mosque . Three days later , the footage aired around the world  --  and the damage was done . <P> At the Pentagon , military officials say the video lacks enough context to draw any firm conclusion about whether the Marine had legitimately defended himself or committed a war crime . But several officers interviewed by TIME concede that the images look bad and could indeed lead to a court-martial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8 Iraqi allies and an estimated 1,200 insurgents have been killed , it was a propaganda coup for the other side . " I 'm upset if this Marine murdered in cold blood , " says Bernard Trainor , a retired Marine three-star general who faced combat in Korea and Vietnam . " But I also feel a great deal of sympathy for him . " In the streets of Iraq , the verdict is already clear . " Shame on America , " says Laila Hamid , a Fallujah-born Baghdad secretary . " All their lectures on democracy and human rights ... and then they show us what is really in their hearts . " <P> Aside from the public-opinion debacle , questions still outnumber answers when it comes to the circumstances of the shooting . The bare facts are these : a unit of the 3rd Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment went to the mosque with cameraman Kevin Sites in tow . The mosque had been taken the day before by other Marines , but Sites ' unit had heard that insurgents had reoccupied it . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell if the shots had come from the mosque . The widely aired footage shows the Marines entering the mosque , their strides confident but their voices clenched with anxiety . Inside , they see five wounded Iraqis lying on the floor . One voice says that these are the same men wounded the day before . Suddenly a Marine gestures toward one of the Iraqis and yells , " He 's fing faking he 's dead ! " Another Marine responds , " Yeah , he 's breathing . " The injured Iraqi did not appear to be armed or threatening in any way , Sites reported later . " In fact there were no weapons visible in the room , except those carried by the Marines . " But without pause , a Marine in the camera 's eye raises his rifle and shoots the Iraqi in the upper body , splattering his blood against the wall . " He 's dead now , " a Marine says . <P> Afterward , off camera , Sites informed the Marine he had killed a wounded prisoner . The Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , sir . I did n't know . " Sites reported that three other injured Iraqis may also have been shot in the mosque that day . The corpses of four Iraqis have been shipped to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for autopsies , and the Marine shooter in the video , who has not been identified , has been removed from the battlefield . Marines in Fallujah have launched an investigation into the shooting .
