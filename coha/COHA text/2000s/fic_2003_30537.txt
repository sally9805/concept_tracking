Chapter One&lt; The only thing she really knew about Paul Cormier was that he was dying . The blood from the wound in his chest had soaked through his white silk shirt and white linen suit and was running in small rivulets over the white marble tile . The old man opened his eyes as Mattie Sharpe crouched helplessly beside him , grasping his hand in hers . He peered up at her , as if he were trying to see through a thick fog . " Christine ? Is that you , Christine ? " Even in a croaked whisper , his accent was elegant and vaguely European . " Yes , Paul . " Lying was the only thing she could do for him . Mattie held his hand tightly . " It 's Christine . " " Missed you , girl . Missed you so much . " " I 'm here now . " Cormier 's pale blue gaze focused on her for a few seconds . " No , " he said . " You 're not here . But I 'm almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might have started out as a chuckle but turned into a ghastly , gurgling cough . " Yes . You 're almost here . " " Be good to see you again . " " Yes . " A hot , torpid island breeze wafted through the front hall of the Cormier mansion . The silence from the surrounding jungle was unnatural and oppressive . " It 's going to be all right , Paul . Everything will be fine . " Lies . More lies . Cormier squinted up at her , his gaze startlingly lucid for an instant . " Get out of here . Hurry . " " I 'll go , " Mattie promised . Cormier 's eyes closed again . " Someone will come . An old friend . When he does , tell him ... tell him . " Another terrible gasping sound drained more of the little strength he had left . " What do you want me to tell him ? " " Reign ... " Cormier choked on his own blood . " In hell . " Mattie did n't pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him say . Automatically she reassured him . " I 'll tell him . " The hand that had been clutching hers slackened its grip . " Christine ? " " I 'm here , Paul . " But Cormier did not hear her this time . He was gone . The horror of her situation washed over Mattie again . She struggled to her feet , feeling light-headed . Without thinking , she glanced at the black and gold watch on her wrist as if she were late to a business appointment . With a shock she realized she had been in the white mansion overlooking the ocean for less than five minutes . She would have been here two hours earlier if she had n't gotten lost on a winding island road that had dead-ended in the mountains . At the time the delay had made her tense and anxious . It occurred to Mattie now that if she had arrived on time , she probably would have walked straight into the same gun that had killed Paul Cormier . The toe of her Italian leather shoe struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile . Mattie jumped at the loud sound in the eerily silent hall . Then she glanced down and saw the gun . Cormier 's , probably , she told herself . He must have tried to fight off the intruder . Dazed , Mattie took a step toward the weapon . Perhaps she should take it with her . Even as the words formed in her mind she shuddered . The last gun she had handled had been a little plastic model that had come in a box labeled , " Annie Oakley 's Sharpshooter Special . For ages five and up . " A friend had given it to her on the occasion of her sixth birthday . Mattie had practiced her fast draw for hours , whipping the toy gun out of its pink fringed , imitation leather holster over and over again until her concerned parents had taken it from her and replaced it with a box of watercolors . Mattie had dutifully played with the paints for approximately ten minutes and succeeded in producing a cheerful yellow horse for Annie Oakley to ride . The picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang on the refrigerator next to her sister Ariel 's latest rendition of a bouquet of flowers . Her training in handguns thus halted at such an early stage , Mattie realized , now that she had absolutely no idea of how to use the lethal-looking monster lying at her feet on the white floor . On the other hand , how complicated could it be ? she asked herself as she stooped to pick up the heavy weapon . Every punk on every city street back in the States owned and operated one . It was a sure bet most of them were too illiterate to read the manuals . Besides , it was easy to see which end to point away from herself . Oh , God . She was getting hysterical . It was a sure sip of losing control . She had to get a grip on herself . She could panic later if necessary . Mattie took several deep breaths while she fumbled the gun into her elegant black and tan leather shoulder bag . She paused as she noticed the bloodstains on the strap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . She had to move quickly . A man was dead and among his last words had been the advice to get out of the mansion in a hurry . She did not doubt that the danger was still hovering . Mattie could sense it as if it were a palpable presence . She took one last look at the body of the silver-haired old man . She had a fleeting vision of white-white linen suit , white buck shoes , white silk shirt , white marble tile , white walls , white furniture . White , endless , pure , unadulterated white . Except for the red blood . Mattie felt her stomach heave . She could not be sick now . She had to get out of here . She stumbled for the open front door , her heels clattering loudly on the marble . Her only thought was to reach the battered old rental car that she had picked up at the tiny island airport two hours earlier . She was nearly out the door when she remembered the sword . Halting , she glanced back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go back . Valor , the fourteenth-century sword she had been sent to collect , was valuable but not worth the trip back into that room . Nothing was worth going back into that room . Aunt Charlotte would understand . What was it Aunt Charlotte had told her about the ancient weapon ? Something about there being a curse on it . Death to all who dare claim this blade until it shall be taken up by the avenger and cleansed in the blood of the betrayer . The terrible prophecy had apparently been fufilled in Cormier 's case , Mattie thought . Not that she believed in such things . Still , Cormier had claimed the blade and now he was dead . Mattie suddenly had no interest whatsoever in locating the medieval sword and taking it back to Seattle . She whirled around again and ran through the open door , scrabbling in her purse for the key to the rental car . Perhaps that was why she did n't see the man who stood on the veranda to one side of the open door . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of her until she tripped over it and went flying . She sprawled on the white planking of the veranda , the wind knocked out of her . Before she could get back enough breath to scream , she felt something cold and metallic against the nape of her neck . Mattie wondered with an odd , clinical detachment if there would be any small warning sound before the trigger was pulled . " Hell , it 's you , Mattie , " said a deep male voice Mattie had not heard in nearly a year . The gun was no longer pressed against her nape but Mattie was still frozen with fear and shock . " You almost got yourself killed . I did n't know who was going to come running out that door . You all right , babe ? " Mattie managed to nod , still fighting for breath . She opened her eyes and realized the wooden planks she was staring down at were less than three inches away . She could not seem to gather her thoughts . It was all too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mattie ? " The dark , rough-edged voice crackled with impatience . " I 'm okay . " A strange relief washed through her at the thought . Then came another chill . " Cormier . " " What about him ? " " He 's in there . " " Dead ? " She closed her eyes . " Yes . Oh , God , yes . " " Get up . " " I do n't think I can . " " Yes , you damn well can . Move it , Mattie . We ca n't lie around here chatting . " Strong fingers locked around her waist and hauled her to her feet . " You never did listen to me , did you , Hugh ? " Mattie brushed aside the tendrils of tawny brown hair that had come free of the neat coil at the nape of her neck . She looked up into gray eyes that were so light they could have been chips off a glacier . " What are you doing here ? " " That 's supposed to be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . What the hell are you doing here on Purgatory ? " But he was n't paying attention to her , not really . He was eyeing the driveway behind her . " Come on . " " I 'm not going back into that house . " Predictably enough , he ignored her . " Get inside the hall , Mattie . You 're a sitting duck standing in the doorway . " Without waiting for a response he yanked her back through the wide opening . Mattie stumbled after him , keeping her eyes averted from the sight of Cormier 's body . She clutched at the strap of her shoulder bag in a vain effort to keep her fingers from trembling . " Do n't move , " Hugh said . " Do n't worry , I wo n't . " She hoped she would not be sick all over the marble floor . He released her and strode quickly over to the body in the white linen suit . He stood looking down for a few seconds , taking in the absoluteness of death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read . It was not shock or surprise or fear or horror  --  just a remote , implacable sort of fierceness . Mattie watched him , aware she should be grateful he had appeared at this particular moment in her life . No one else she knew was better qualified to get her out of this sticky situation than Hugh Abbott . Too bad the mere sight of him enraged her . Too bad that after that humiliating debacle last year she had never wanted to see him again as long as she lived . Too bad that the one man she needed right now was the same one who had devastated her after she had surrendered to him , body and soul . He had not changed much in the past year , she realized . Same thick , dark pelt of hair with maybe a bit more silver in it . Same lean , whipcord-tough body that still did n't show any hint of softening , despite his forty years . Same rough-featured , heavily carved face . Same beautiful , incredibly sexy mouth . Same primitive masculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattie noted with a disdaining glance . Scarred boots , unpressed khaki shirt unbuttoned far enough to show a lot of crisp , curling chest hair , a well-worn leather belt and faded jeans that emphasized his flat belly and strong thighs . Hugh glanced at her . " I 'll be right back . I 'm just going to get some stuff from the kitchen . " He was already moving past the body . He held the gun in his hand so naturally it seemed an extension of his arm . " The kitchen . For God 's sake , Hugh . This is no time to grab a cold beer . What if he 's still here ? The man who shot poor Mr. Cormier ? " " Do n't worry . There 's no one else here . If there were , you would be as dead as Cormier by now . " Mattie swallowed as he left the room . " No ,  --  wait , please do n't leave me here with  --  " Mattie bit off the rest of the frantic plea . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plead with Hugh Abbott to stay . " Damn you , " she whispered . Mattie stood listening to the ring of Hugh 's boots on the marble tiles . She heard him move down a hall into another room , and then there was nothing but the awful silence and the hot breeze . Glancing nervously out the door , she toyed with the keys of the rental car . Nothing said she had to stand around and wait for Hugh . She could drive herself back to the airport . Right now she wanted nothing more than to get on a plane and leave this dreadful island . But she was feeling very lost and uncertain . Practicing a quick draw with the Annie Oakley special had been one of her few forays into the world of adventure . Her artistically oriented family had emphasized more civilized and sophisticated pursuits . Hugh Abbott , on the other hand , understood situations involving violence and danger all too well . As chief troubleshooter and free-lance security consultant for Aunt Charlotte 's multinational company , Vailcourt Industries , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had privately thought of Hugh as her aunt 's pet wolf long before she had met him last year . Nothing she had learned about him since had given her any cause to change her mind . She heard his boot heels on the tile again . Hugh reappeared carrying two large French market-style string bags that bulged with an assortment of unidentifiable items . " All right . We 've spent enough time fooling around here . Let 's go . " Hugh glided around Cormier 's body , not looking down . He saw the keys in Mattie 's fingers . " Forget that junker you rented . You 're not going anywhere in it . " " What do you mean ? Are we going to take your car ? Where is it , anyway ? " " A few hundred yards up the road . Hopefully out of sight  --  but who knows for how long ? " Hugh strode toward her . " Here , take one of these . I want to keep a hand free . " He thrust one of the string bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the leaden sky . " It 's going to start pouring any minute . That should help . " Mattie ignored the comment about the impending rain . She was too busy trying to juggle the heavy string bag and her purse . " What are these sacks for ? We do n't need this stuff . I just want to get to the airport . " " The airport is closed . " Mattie stared at him in shock . " Closed ? It ca n't be closed . " " It is . I barely made it in myself . There are armed men on the road , and every plane that did n't get off the island as of forty minutes ago is probably in flames by now . Including mine , goddamn it . Charlotte 's going to have to reimburse me for that Cherokee . It was a real sweet little crate . " " Dear heaven . Hugh , what 's going on ? What is this all about ? " " With your usual fine sense of timing , you walked straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup here on Purgatory . At the moment I have no way of knowing who 's winning . In the meantime the only way off the island is by boat . We 're going to try for Cormier 's cruiser . " " I do n't believe this . " " Believe it . Come on , let 's go . " " Go where ? " she demanded . " First to the bathroom . " Hugh started down the hall . " For God 's sake , Hugh , I assure you I do n't have to use the bathroom . At least , not right at the moment . Hugh , wait . Please stop . I do n't understand this . " He turned in the doorway , his eyes cold . " Mattie , I do n't want to hear another word out of you . Come here . Now . " Deciding she was too stressed out to think clearly , Mattie trailed after him . She closed her eyes as she stepped around Cormier 's body and found herself following Hugh down a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . " Mr. Cormier certainly did n't like colors very much , " Mattie muttered . " Yeah . He used to say he 'd worked in the shadows long enough . When he retired he wanted to live in the sun . " Hugh opened a door off the bedroom suite . " What did he mean by that ? " " Never mind . It does n't matter now . Here we go . " Hugh strode into the bathroom . Mattie followed uneasily . " Hugh , I really do n't understand . " She frowned as she watched him step into the huge white tub and push at a section of wall behind the taps . " What in the world  --  ? " " Cormier built a lot of ways out of this place . He was a born strategist . " " I see . He was expecting trouble , then ? " " Not specifically . Not here on Purgatory . " Hugh watched as the wall panel slid aside to reveal a dark corridor . " But like I say , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mattie shivered as she stared into the darkness . The old uneasiness she always felt in confined places stirred in the pit of her stomach . " Uh , Hugh , maybe I should warn you , I 'm not very good in  --  " " Not now , Mattie . " His tone was impatient as he stepped into the black corridor and turned around to reach for her hand . " Do we have to go this way ? " Mattie asked helplessly . " Stop whining , babe . I do n't have time to listen to it . " Thoroughly humiliated now , Mattie found the strength to step into the corridor . Hugh pushed a button and the panel slid shut behind her . She held her breath but discovered she did not have to stand long in the darkness . Hugh switched on a flashlight he 'd taken from one of the string bags . " Thank God you found a flashlight , " Mattie said . " No problem . Cormier kept a couple in every room of the house . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably one in here , too . Electricity is always a little erratic on an island like this . Come on , babe . " The hallway was narrow but mercifully short . With the assistance of the light and several deep breaths , Mattie was able to control her claustrophobia just as she did in elevators . Hugh was pushing another button and opening an exit in the side of the house before her own personal walls had begun to close in to any great extent . Mattie stepped outside with a sense of relief and found herself in the middle of a leafy green jungle bower that grew right up to the side of the mansion . She batted at a huge , broad leaf that was directly in front of her . " Well , that was n't so bad , but I really do n't see why we had to leave that way . It seems to me it would have been simpler to walk straight to the car . " Hugh was moving forward into what looked to Mattie like a wall of thick foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , Mattie . I do n't want to lose you in the jungle . " " I 'm not going into any jungle . " " Yes , you are . You and I are going to do the only smart thing we can do under these circumstances . We 're going to stay out of sight until we can get hold of transportation . " " Hugh , this is crazy . I 'm not traipsing off into that jungle . In fact , I 'm not going anywhere at all until I 've had a chance to think . " " You can think later . Right now you 're just going to move . " He was already vanishing into the greenery . Aunt Charlotte 's pet wolf was apparently accustomed to giving orders and having them followed . He had been known to give orders to Charlotte , herself . Mattie stood irresolute near the wall of the mansion , the string bag dangling from her fingers . Common sense told her she should be running after Hugh . He was , after all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of disbelief , shock , and an old irrational anger held her frozen for an instant . Hugh glanced back over his shoulder , eyes narrowing . " Get moving , Mattie . Now . " He did not raise his voice , but the words were a whiplash that broke through Mattie 's uncertainty . She hurried forward , fighting with her purse and the string bag . Two steps past the barrier of broad leaves , Mattie found herself completely enveloped in an eerie green world . Her senses were overwhelmed by the rich , humid scent . The ground beneath her shoes was soft and springy and nearly black in color ; a giant compost pile that had been simmering for eons . It sucked at her two-hundred-dollar Italian shoes as if it were a living thing that feasted on fancy leather . Massive ferns that would have won first place in any garden show back in Seattle hovered in Mattie 's path like plump green ghosts . Long , meandering vines studded with exotic orchids billowed around her . It was like swimming beneath the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed on her head . " Hugh , where are we going ? We 'll get lost in here . " " We 're not going far . And we wo n't get lost . All we have to do is keep the house to our backs and the sound of the ocean to our left . Cormier was a wily old fox . He always made certain he had a bolt hole , and he kept the escape plans simple . " " If he was so clever , why is he dead back there inside that mansion ? " " Even smart old foxes eventually slow down and make mistakes . " Hugh pushed past a bank of massive leaves that blocked the way . The leaves promptly sprang back into position . A mass of beautiful white lilies slapped Mattie right in the face . " Ariel was right , " she muttered under her breath at Hugh 's disappearing back , " you really are n't much of a gentleman , are you ? " She pushed at the lilies , the string bag and her purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these leaves , " Hugh advised over his shoulder . " They 're real springy . " " I noticed . " Mattie ducked to avoid the next swinging mass of greenery . She was grateful for the aerobic exercise program she had begun nearly a year ago on her thirty-first birthday . She had taken it up as one of many antidotes to the stress that seemed to press down on her from all directions these days . Without that regular exercise , she never would have had the physical stamina to keep up with Hugh Abbott as they raced through a jungle . Not that it was ever easy for a woman such as herself to keep up with Hugh under the best of circumstances . As he had once made very clear , she was not his type . Mattie winced at the memory of that old humiliation . " Not much farther now . How you doing , babe ? " Hugh vaulted lightly over a fallen log and reached back to give Mattie a hand . " I 'm still here , are n't I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier . The canopy of green overhead began to drip like a leaky ceiling . Mattie heard something tear as she scrambled over the log . She thought at first it was the seat of her beautifully tailored olive green trousers but realized it was the sleeve of her cream-colored silk shirt instead . It had gotten caught on a vine . " Damn . " Mattie glanced down at the rip and sighed . " Why would Cormier show you his escape route ? " she asked , raising her eyes to Hugh 's back . " I did n't know you even knew him . " He did n't turn or even slow his pace as he answered . " You 'd have found out I knew him if you 'd stuck to your original schedule and been on the plane to St. Gabe this morning the way you were supposed to be . Did n't Charlotte 's travel department make the reservations for you ? " " They made them . I altered my plans at the last minute when I saw the itinerary . I recognized St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided I did n't need you for a tour guide . " " Even though you were going straight into Purgatory ? " he asked dryly . " Come on , now , Mattie . You know what they say . Better the devil you know . Look what happened when you decided to go your own way . " " I suppose you would have realized instantly that there was a military coup going on here ? " " Long before you did , babe . As soon as I contacted the tower , I knew something was wrong . If you 'd been with me , we would n't have even touched down . I 'd have turned and headed for Hades or Brimstone and tried to contact Cormier by phone to see what was happening . " " Hugh , please . I realize that you are ever vigilant and always prepared when it comes to this sort of thing and I 'm not . But I really do n't need any of your lectures right now . " To Mattie 's astonishment , his voice gentled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still a little shook , myself , that 's all . " She stared at his broad-shouldered back , not believing her ears . " You ? Shook ? " " Hell , yes . I was afraid I was going to walk in and find you dead in that hall along with Cormier . " " Oh . " " Is that all you can say ? " The gentleness had already vanished from his rough voice . " Well , I can see where it would have been a bit awkward explaining things to Aunt Charlotte . " " Christ . There is that , is n't there ? She 'd have had my head . " Hugh came to an abrupt halt . He was looking at a small , fern-choked stream flowing past his boots . " Okay , here we go . " Mattie peered at the twisting ribbon of water . " Now what ? " " We turn left and follow this stream . " Hugh glanced back the way they had come . " I think we 've got the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go . " The rain was coming down harder now , battering at the leaves so violently that it created a dull roar . Mattie followed Hugh in silence , her whole attention focused on keeping up with him while she juggled the string bag and her purse . The black earth was turning to mud . Her shoes were caked with it . Her hair had long since come free of its neat coil and hung in limp tendrils around her shoulders . Her silk shirt was soaked . The rain had cooled things down a little , but not much . The whole jungle seemed to be steaming like a thick , green stew . Mattie eyed the ground , watching each step she took so that she did not stumble in the tangle of mud and vines . She took a closer look at the vines when she caught her toe on one . " Hugh , " she asked wearily , " what about snakes ? " " What about ' em ? " " Do they come out in the rain ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn it , Hugh . " He chuckled . " Forget about snakes . There are n't any on these islands . " " Are you sure ? " " I 'm sure . " " I hope you 're right . " She dragged the string bag over another fallen log . Something small and green came alive under the hand she had used to brace herself . " Hugh . " He glanced back . " Just a little lizard . He 's more scared than you are . " " That 's a matter of opinion . " Mattie forced herself to take several deep breaths as the small creature scuttled quickly out of sight . " Hugh , this really is n't my kind of thing , you know ? " " I know it 's a little outside your field of expertise , babe , but you 'll get the hang of it . Your problem is you 've spent too much of your time with those namby-pamby art collectors whose idea of living dangerously is investing in an unknown artist . " Mattie bristled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite right , of course . " He did n't seem to notice her sarcastic tone . " Sure , I 'm right . You ought to get out of Seattle more often . Go places . Do things . Charlotte says this is your first vacation in two years . When was the last time you did something really exciting ? " Mattie shoved wet hair out of her eyes and set her back teeth . " About a year ago when I seduced you and asked you to marry me and take me back to St. Gabriel with you . You may recall the occasion . And we both know where that bit of excitement got me . " Hugh was silent for an embarrassing amount of time before he said , " Yeah , well , that was n't quite what I meant . " " Really ? " Mattie smiled grimly to herself and pulled a shoe out of the mud . " I assure you , that was adventurous enough for me . I 've been thoroughly enjoying the quiet life ever since . Until now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year  --  " " I do n't want to discuss it . " " Well , we 're going to discuss it . " Hugh slashed at an orchid-covered vine with his hand . " Damn it , Mattie , I 've been trying to talk to you about that for months . If you had n't been avoiding me , we could have had it all worked out by now . " " There is nothing to work out . You were quite right when you told me I was not your type . " She pushed wearily at more vines . " Believe me , I could n't agree with you more . " " You 're just a little upset , " he said soothingly . " You could say that . " " We 'll talk about it later . " Hugh came to an abrupt halt . Mattie promptly collided with him . " Oooph . " She staggered backward a step and caught her balance . It was like running into a rock wall , she thought resentfully . No give in the man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently oblivious to the collision . He was looking up . Mattie followed his gaze , aware that the roar of water had grown considerably louder during the past few minutes . She realized why when she peered around Hugh 's broad shoulders and saw twin waterfalls cascading out of the old lava cliffs in front of her . The two torrents plunged fifty feet or more into a fern-shrouded grotto . The pool at the base of the falls was nearly hidden by masses of huge , exotic blooms and the twisted rock formations typical of long-cooled lava . Mattie frowned . " This is Cormier 's escape route ? " " The escape route is behind the falls . There 's a network of old lava caves in this mountain . One of the tunnels leads to a cavern that opens in the middle of a sheer rock cliff that faces the sea . The cavern is partially flooded . Cormier always kept a boat in there . " " Caves ? " The sense of uneasiness that had been bothering Mattie since they had entered the dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of caves ? " " Yeah . Do n't worry . Nothing tricky . Cormier marked the route so we wo n't get lost . Ready ? " " I do n't think so , Hugh . " Her voice was high and thin . Hugh shot her an impatient glance as he started toward the grotto . " Do n't dawdle , babe . I want you off this damned island as soon as possible . " He was right , of course . They could hardly hang around here . There was too much chance of running into the same people Paul Cormier had recently encountered . But oh God , caves . Her worst nightmare made real . Mattie was already damp from the rain and her own perspiration . Now she felt icy sweat trickle down her sides and between her breasts . She took a few deep breaths and chanted the mantra she had learned when she had taken lessons in stress-relieving meditation techniques . Hugh was already moving along a rocky ledge that vanished into inky darkness behind one of the falls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his movements unconsciously graceful . He looked back once more to make certain Mattie was following , and then he disappeared behind a thundering cascade of water . Mattie took one more deep breath and prepared to follow . She reminded herself grimly that she had once vowed to follow this man anywhere . What a fool she had been . The mist off the falls looked like smoke as she passed through it . If she had not already been soaked by the rain and her own sweat , she would have been drenched by the spray . As it was , she barely noticed the additional moisture . But her Italian leather shoes had not been designed to undergo this sort of abuse . Mattie clung to her purse and string bag and struggled desperately to balance on the uneven surface . She felt her left foot slide across a slick patch of moss , and everything started to tilt . " Oh , no . Oh , no . " Wide-eyed and helpless to save herself , she started to topple backward into the pool at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hugh 's hand shot out of the darkness and clamped around her wrist to steady her . With effortless ease he yanked her to safety behind the falls . " There you go , babe . No sweat . " " Tell me something , Hugh , " she asked acidly . " Were you always this fast on your feet ? You move like a cat . " " Hell , no . I used to be a lot faster . I 'm forty now , you know . I 've slowed down some . Happens to everyone , I guess . " " Amazing . " Her voice was drier than ever , but Hugh did n't seem to notice . He was busy rummaging around in the string bag . " And I 'll tell you something else , babe , " he added , " No matter how fast you are , there 's always someone faster . That 's one of the reasons I finally got smart and took that nice cushy job with your aunt . " " I see . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She really did not know all that much about Hugh Abbott . " Have you ever actually met someone faster than yourself ? " Hugh was silent for a heartbeat . " Yeah . " " What happened to him ? " " He 's dead . " " So he was n't quite fast enough . " " I guess not . " But their conversation could n't distract Mattie from the horrible darkness that loomed ahead . A cave . She would never be able to handle this , she thought . Never in a million years . This was far worse than any elevator or dark hall or jungle . This was the real thing , straight out of one of her childhood nightmares . Mattie 's stomach twisted . She started to tell Hugh she could not go another step when something went crunch under the toe of her expensive , ruined shoe . Automatically Mattie looked down and saw the flattened body of the biggest cockroach she had ever seen in her life . " That does it , " Mattie announced . " You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be very sick . "
