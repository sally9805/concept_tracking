<p> According to the Institute of Medicine , as many as 98,000 Americans die each year because of medical negligence . This translates roughly into 4,000 hospital deaths every year in Illinois . It does n't include outpatient injuries and deaths . <p> The Sun-Times series on medical mistakes ( Jan. 23-25 ) illustrates how quickly we need to change our health care system in order to prevent unnecessary deaths and injuries . Illinois has been rated as one of the 10 worst states for protecting patients , Public Citizen reports . <p> Families Advocating Injury Reduction and other health care advocates believe one solution to prevent injuries is patients taking an active role in their health care and becoming better educated in the health care choices they make . Patients have the right to know about the choices of treatments available to them and about their medication and its side effects . Patients should have the right to know about the background of the physician who is diagnosing , medicating and treating them . <p> In Illinois , it is difficult to research a doctor 's professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Patients Right to Know Act , which will give consumers easy access to a physician 's background so they can make educated and safe choices when purchasing health care . Consumer surveys consistently show overwhelming support for physician profiling . <p> The House Health Care Availability and Access Committee 's vote on the bill Feb. 15 will show if the majority of lawmakers will be in favor of helping to prevent 4,000 needless deaths in Illinois or getting more campaign contributions from Illinois State Medical Society members . <p> Ruth Wyman , coordinator , <p> Families Advocating <p> Injury Reduction , Champaign <p> Come clean , Ryan <p> I find it hard to believe that Gov . Ryan was totally unaware of any wrongdoing in his office during his tenure as secretary of state , now that Dean Bauer , his longtime friend and former inspector general , has been indicted by the feds for covering up the widespread bribery in the secretary of state 's driver 's licensing facilities . <p> The indictment further charges Bauer with trying to cover up the investigation of the fiery crash of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident involved a trucker who , prosecutors alleged , paid a bribe for his commercial license . <p> I demand that Ryan come clean on what he knows about this scandal and when he knew about it . He should be required to take a lie-detector test , since his office is tainted with the blood of the six dead Willis children . This tragedy would not have happened if Ricardo Guzman did n't purchase his license illegally . <p> John Rivera , <p> Lincoln Square <p> Gov. should resign <p> Gov . Ryan finally takes responsibility for the bribery scandal in the secretary of state 's office , which he had headed , but says he was unaware of any wrongdoing and will not resign . <p> If he were truly unaware , in addition to claiming responsibility , Ryan should also claim overwhelming stupidity and severe myopia  --  which should be grounds for resignation . <p> Mary Sabatino , Lombard <p> More police for L <p> Your editorial ( " Focusing on a safer CTA , " Feb. 1 ) correctly delineated and suggested several measures that the CTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its riders and employees . <p> Regarding the CTA 's use of " emergency call buttons " on train platforms , I can tell you that as an everyday user of the system , these " customer assistance " buttons are most often ignored by customer assistant attendants on duty . Therefore , they offer little or no value . <p> Regarding your suggestion that restoring the canine patrols could be an effective option in providing enhanced security : As People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals pointed out last year , many CTA riders feel that the provider of CTA guard dogs  --  National K-9  --  does a very poor job of training and handling their dogs . It continues to disturb me that the CTA still finds it necessary to use muzzled dogs wearing dirty clothing that are forced to sit and lay on filthy train floors and that are transported around in tiny boxes on the back of a truck . The use of muzzled dogs should be eliminated . <p> I was also surprised that you did not point out one major , viable augmentation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and employees with more security : increased patrols by the Chicago Police Department . I have recently noticed more police officers in train stations and on subway platforms , both in uniform and plain clothes . Some have even been handing out citations to smokers  --  a very welcome sight . <p> The CPD transit police have been doing an outstanding job of boarding , riding and checking CTA buses for years . The same attention now needs to be given to CTA trains , stations and platforms . Police officers with a L station on their beat should be required to make periodic visits to train stations and train platforms . And police officers should start riding the trains the same as they do buses . Along with video cameras , these are the real effective solutions to making CTA riders and employees feel safe again  --  not muzzled dogs . <p> Jeff Kamien , West Town <p> Cars , guns not same <p> In the editorial Jan. 31 , you commended President Clinton for proposing the registration of all handguns . Many people say that because cars are registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be registered only when they are driven on the public way . If one has a large estate , farm or ranch , and the vehicle is not driven off the property , it is not required to be registered . However , I would be willing to register as a firearm owner if I could carry the weapon . <p> Following is a Supreme Court ruling that you might find interesting : In Hayes vs. the United States ( 390 US 85 ( 1986 ) ) , the Supreme Court ruled that criminals have a Fifth Amendment right not to register firearms . <p> Eugene O'Connell , Des Plaines <p> Valuable speech <p> Your editorial ( " Shackling speech , " Jan. 26 ) criticizes the U.S. Supreme Court for sensibly deciding that a state can regulate political contributions without violating free speech because " money is property . . . not speech . " If you really think money is absolutely protected speech , try not paying your taxes because of your constitutional right to free speech and see what happens . <p> If money is speech , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think it obvious the framers of the Constitution did not intend free-speech rights to be based on a Marxist system of economic classes . You have given the phrase " money talks " an Orwellian meaning that can be found nowhere in the early constitutional history of the United States . <p> Why should moneyed interests be allowed to completely convert our political system from a democracy to a plutocracy while hiding sanctimoniously behind the First Amendment ? <p> You argue that modern Americans have " busy schedules " and ca n't do " volunteer campaign work , " which is really free speech . That 's no reason to pervert the plain meaning of free speech to accommodate people who put no value on their free speech rights . <p> Prof. Michael J. Polelle , <p> John Marshall Law School <p> A private cell <p> Kathy Posner writes that the cell phone ban proposed by Metra was hypocritical because the agency 's ads show cell phone users on the trains ( Letters , Feb. 3 ) . Good point , but Posner ended her letter with a flaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to possible " cell phone-free " cars and " leave the rest of us alone to our personal cell phone conversations . " <p> I must ask one question : If her cell phone conversations are so personal , then why is she holding them on public transportation ? <p> Jim Rafferty , Lyons <p> ' Boutique ' school <p> As a graduate of a Jesuit university , I am usually proud of the accomplishments of the Jesuit community in Chicago . As a former member of the board of directors of a non-Jesuit Catholic boys high school in Chicago , I am equally proud of its accomplishments . <p> But choose sides I must , and choose sides I shall . For the Jesuits to open what is essentially a " boutique " high school , Cristo Rey , despite the struggles for enrollment by virtually all Catholic high schools in Chicago , is both insensitive and insulting ( news story , Jan. 25 ) . <p> The needs trumpeted by Cristo Rey are currently being met in exemplary fashion by hard-working students , alumni , parents , faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We work to embrace , not patronize . <p> J.J. Kean , Naples , Fla . <p> Do n't exempt pols <p> The interview ( Feb. 6 ) by Trude Feldman outlining Hillary Rodham Clinton 's ideas for the new millennium was very interesting . I see Clinton is still pushing for national health care . I agree we need it . <p> But unlike her original plan , the same coverage should apply to everyone  --  elected officials as well . One plan for them and a different plan for the rest of us is unacceptable . With the huge pensions they receive , I think they get enough fringe benefits as it is . <p> Dorothy Farnsworth , <p> Portage Park <p> Keep Clintons away <p> So Hillary Rodham Clinton is now an official candidate for the U.S. Senate : Woop-dee-doo . In a way , I hope she wins . At least it would keep her  --  and her equally illustrious husband  --  away from Illinois ! <p> Matt C. Abbott , Edgewater <p> Viva Cub fans <p> A recent research study found that people who are optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average Cub fan should live forever . <p> William E.
