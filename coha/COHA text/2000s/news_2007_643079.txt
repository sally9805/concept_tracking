<p> The original press box at the 16-year-old U.S. Cellular Field was a fine place to cover a White Sox game . From their nest behind home plate , reporters could easily discern the spin of a curveball or hear the thwack of bat on ball . <p> But this year , the White Sox gutted it and remade it into the Jim Beam Club , with 200 theater seats and barstools that cost $260 to $315 each ; when sold out , the club could generate $4 million or more in revenue . <p> " We were giving the press the best real estate in the building , slightly elevated behind home plate , which they do n't need , " said Jerry Reinsdorf , the real estate investor who is chairman of the White Sox . <p> When asked why he moved the press to a much worse vista two levels up and along the first-base and right-field line , Reinsdorf unhesitatingly said , " Financial . " <p> Reinsdorf is far from unique among team owners looking at the extra money that can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate more luxury suites or club seats . <p> At the same time , baseball reporters ( usually print and radio ) have been shifted to higher spots , as in PNC Park in Pittsburgh , or inferior aeries like the one at the year-old Busch Stadium in St. Louis . The Cardinals improved the habitability of the press box before this season as part of renovations needed to play host to the 2009 All-Star Game ; the press box is higher than it was in the old Busch Stadium , a design that gives preference to luxury boxes . <p> " Last year , it was a gulag , " said Joe Strauss of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch . <p> After years of resisting his owners ' cries to expand their inventory of courtside seating , N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern relented this season , permitting teams to move reporters into the lower bowl of arenas . <p> N.F.L. reporters are used to inconvenient press boxes . They have been relocated to the corners of , or behind , end zones  --  as they are in the renovated Soldier Field in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillette Stadium in Foxboro , Mass . Or to higher altitudes , as they are in Giants Stadium . John Mara , a co-owner of the Giants , said the press box problem would be rectified in the stadium to be built with the Jets . <p> " Pampering the press used to be more important than taking care of your highest-paid customers , " said Marc Ganis , a sports consultant . " Now it comes down to the old real estate maxim : location , location , location . " <p> In the Jim Beam Club during the Yankees-White Sox game Wednesday night , the privileged packed the tables in the club 's indoor restaurant to dine on smoked turkey with apricot and pineapple chutney , and bay scallops with orzo . <p> Pres Harris sat with his two sons in the front row outside , marveling at his good fortune because someone had given him three tickets to the club while he was standing in line at the ballpark to buy reserved seats . <p> " It 's fantastic , " he said of the view from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters . <p> Becky Roppolo , who works for a local steel company , came dressed in a Paul Konerko replica jersey , and was elated that her boss had given her his tickets for the second time . The sweet seat , she said , " kind of spoils you . " <p> Joe Varan , a real estate investor from Hinsdale , Ill. , was in one of the four front-row , center-of-the-club seats that he splits with a friend . <p> " There 's nothing like this , " said Varan , who then compared the club to the " scout seats " on the field level behind home plate ; they cost $220 to $285 each . " You can call the balls and strikes and see the outfield plays develop . " <p> None of the fans said they much cared that they had displaced reporters who now depend more on TV monitors than they once did . It is a sentiment they share with Reinsdorf . <p> " It does n't matter if Dave van Dyck can see how much the ball breaks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball writer . <p> Van Dyck said his former view mattered greatly ; now he can not see plays developing or the " full scan of the field . " <p> " It 's like watching TV from the side , " he added , still irate that the team did not consult reporters about the change . <p> Joe Cowley , who covers the White Sox for the Chicago Sun-Times , said he did not mind the view , and he was not surprised about the White Sox ' move . " They sold out the start time to 7-Eleven , " he said , referring to a sponsorship deal with the chain of convenience stores to shift the starting time of night games to 7:11 . <p> In N.B.A. arenas , reporters in some cities have been moved out of earshot of the repartee among players , coaches and referees . <p> " You could tell what Jerry Sloan was thinking by hearing how much he was swearing , " said Phil Miller , who until recently covered the Utah Jazz for The Salt Lake Tribune , referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really guided your knowledge of what was going on on the floor . " <p> The Denver Nuggets , for example , added eight new courtside seats at $750 apiece by moving the press elsewhere . At Quicken Loans Arena , the Cleveland Cavaliers added 16 courtside seats ( at $1,600 each ) that flank the scorer 's table by moving reporters to comparatively distant locations . Similar changes have been made by the Los Angeles Clippers at Staples Center , and by the Jazz and the Golden State Warriors . <p> For next season , the Los Angeles Lakers have sold 15 new courtside seats , at $2,300 each , at Staples Center , moving reporters 20 rows back , said John Black , a team spokesman . <p> Paul Andrews , executive vice president for Kroenke Sports Enterprises , the Nuggets ' parent company , said the team tried to balance its goal of raising revenue with respecting the news media , even as it moved reporters to a low corner at the Pepsi Center . <p> Some of the Nuggets ' new courtside seats , which are similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scorer 's table as the press once did , beside the team bench , with a television monitor and waiter service to augment their experience . <p> This season the Knicks moved the last of the reporters who were still working courtside at Madison Square Garden to a press area behind a basket . That let the team sell 20 new seats , some of which cost $2,000 or more . <p> " Fans will pay a premium to experience the game in a way they have n't before , and to separate themselves from Joe Average , " said Dan Migala , the publisher of a sports-marketing newsletter , The Migala Report . <p> The N.B.A. has left it to the teams to determine whether they would move reporters and where they would put them , while keeping TV broadcasters at scorer 's tables . Brian McIntyre , a league spokesman , said the change was not made because of the weakening influence of newspapers . <p> " It was strictly a way to get revenue , " he said , " and some people closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian Windhorst , who covers the Cavaliers for The Akron Beacon Journal , the presence of nearby reporters working on deadline " has upset a lot of fans , and there 've been some , and caused some nasty incidents . " <p> He added , " We 're trying to do our job , and they 're trying to have fun . " <p> At U.S. Cellular Field , the relocated press box prompted a demand by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America to meet with Commissioner Bud Selig to receive assurances that a similarly drastic change would not occur at other ballparks . ( The Kansas City Royals are moving their press box up a level , but still behind home plate , next season . ) <p> " We 're paid to do the job to the best of our ability , " Mark Gonzales of The Chicago Tribune said as he watched Wednesday 's game from high above first base . His new sightline hindered his ability to best describe , with his own eyes , Mark Buehrle 's no-hitter on April 18 . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #
