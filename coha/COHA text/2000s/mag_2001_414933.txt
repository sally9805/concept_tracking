How to treat the top 8 illnesses // SEEMS LIKE WHENEVER YOUR CHILD GETS OVER A SORE THROAT , FEVER , COUGH , OR BOUT of diarrhea , he immediately comes down with something else . " Children also catch between four and nine colds a year , " says Thomas Powers , M.D. , a pediatrician in private practice in Brooklyn , New York . " If you do the math , that 's about one every six weeks . " No wonder you may feel as though you spend more time with the pediatrician than with your spouse ! Children under 3 are especially vulnerable : Their immune systems are n't yet fully developed , so they 're less capable of fighting off illness . And when they do get sick , their symptoms can be more severe than those of older kids exposed to the same viruses or bacteria . So it 's crucial to know the ailments your baby or toddler is most susceptible to and when you should call the doctor . 1 Colds There 's usually no reason to worry when your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick , greenish discharge dripping from her nose . " That 's actually very common in children with colds and is n't a sign of a bacterial infection , as it is in adults , " says Carden Johnston , M.D. , a pediatrician at Children 's Hospital in Birmingham , Alabama . Still , a seemingly harmless cold can quickly turn into a more serious respiratory illness in infants 3 months and younger , so be sure to check your baby for fever and call the pediatrician if her temperature tops 100.2 deg F. Children between 3 and 6 months with a fever of at least 101 deg F should also be examined . A high temperature is n't necessarily cause for alarm : " Some kids run fevers at the drop of a hat , " says Joan Shook , M.D. , chief of pediatric emergency medicine at Texas Children 's Hospital in Houston . " In most cases , a fever just has to run its course . " If your baby is older than 6 months and has a gardenvariety cold , you can treat her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest and drinks lots of fluids , including water and fruit juice . ( Babies should also continue to nurse or drink formula . ) Sponging her with lukewarm water or letting her sit in a tepid bath should bring down her temperature and help her feel more comfortable ; you can also give her acetaminophen or ibuprofen ( but never aspirin-it puts kids at risk for Reye 's syndrome ) . " A cool-mist vaporizer will help break up congestion and may keep secretions in her chest and sinuses loose , " according to Cheston Berlin , M.D. , a professor of pediatrics at Pennsylvania State University 's Hershey Medical Center . " You can then use a bulb syringe to suction mucus from a little baby 's nose or have your child blow gently into a tissue . " Another tip : Do n't give children under 3 an over-the-counter cough preparation or decongestant without first consulting your pediatrician ; such medicines do n't have much effect except to make children drowsy . For all kids , avoid any medication that contains phenylpropanolamine , in light of recent evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stroke . Finally , stay alert for any changes in your child 's condition and call the doctor if she is n't feeling better in a week , has trouble breathing , or runs a fever over 102 deg F. 2 Ear Infections Your 2-year-old is just getting over a cold when he spikes a fever of 102 deg F and starts tugging at his ear . The cause ? Most likely an ear infection , which , after colds , is the most common reason for pediatrician visits among children under 3 . The culprits are your child 's tiny eustachian tubes , which connect his middle ears with the back of his throat and normally drain fluid . When these passages become clogged , fluid builds up and presses against the eardrum  --  and your child starts yelling in pain . The tubes can also be blocked when babies drink from their bottle while lying down and a small amount of milk or formula flows back into their ears . " If they have an ear infection , they 'll usually cry more during feedings because sucking causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston . " They may also fuss more when they lie down and have trouble sleeping . " Older children may tug at the affected ear , but that 's a less than reliable symptom in children under 2 because their nerves are n't developed enough for them to pinpoint the origin of the pain , says Dr. Johnston . If you suspect an ear infection , make an appointment with your pediatrician . In the meantime , you can ease a child 's discomfort with acetaminophen or ibuprofen ( for an infant under 6 months , ask the doctor first ) . You can also apply a warm towel to the achy ear or prop up his head on a few pillows to relieve the pressure in his eardrums . Even if your child has had so many ear infections that you 're a pro at recognizing the symptoms , do n't try to treat one yourself with leftover antibiotics , says Dr. Johnston . Antibiotics are effective only against bacteria ; using them on a viral infection may backfire and encourage the growth of antibioticresistant bacteria . Some doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medication to see if an ear infection will clear up on its own  --  again , to prevent children from being exposed to unnecessary antibiotics . Call the pediatrician if a child of any age has an earache accompanied by a fever , a cold , or a headache ; if you notice any pus coming out of his ears ; or if the glands in his neck start to swell . 3 Tummy Troubles Occasional vomiting and diarrhea in an otherwise healthy child is usually no cause for alarm . But if it 's accompanied by a painful bellyache and fever , she may have gastroenteritis-a fancy name for inflammation of the stomach and intestines . " It 's most often caused by an infection , but it can also flare up if a child 's on antibiotics , " says Dr. Shook . Although you should let the pediatrician know if your child has symptoms of gastroenteritis , most cases can be managed at home and will clear up within a few days . But you should watch out for signs of dehydration-dry mouth , sunken eyes , scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or toddler ca n't keep fluids down or passes watery stool every hour or two . He 'll need to be seen right away or taken to the ER for intravenous fluids . In mild cases , a commercial rehydrating solution , such as Pedialyte , Rehydralyte , or ReVital , may be recommended . Babies may be nursed again or given formula when they can keep liquids down for two to three hours . Call the doctor immediately if a child of any age has a fever , vomits blood or green bile , experiences sharp abdominal pain , or has n't kept fluids down for more than 24 hours . " If your child has a mild bout of diarrhea but otherwise seems active and healthy , you might want to take her off solid food for twenty-four hours to give her digestive system a chance to recover , " says Dr. Shook . Offer her ice pops , Jell-O , small sips of clear fluids ( such as white grape juice or water ) , Gatorade , or a rehydrating solution . Over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications are n't recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older kids with a doctor 's okay . 4 Pneumonia Your toddler looks limp and pale and has a fever of 102 deg F. Her nostrils keep flaring , and she seems to be wheezing and breathing faster than usual . Call the doctor right away : She may have pneumonia , an infection of the lung that usually follows on the heels of a cold or other respiratory disorder . " Pneumonia is usually less worrisome in a child than it is in an adult , so most children can be cared for at home , " says Dr. Johnston . If your child has a viral infection , medication generally is n't necessary and the infection should clear up on its own in a few days . A bacterial infection , on the other hand , will require antibiotics . To help your child feet more comfortable , make sure she gets plenty of rest and drinks lots of fluids . ( Babies can continue to nurse or drink formula . ) A cool-mist vaporizer will help keep secretions in her lungs loose . Do n't give her cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to cough up chest congestion , " says Dr. Johnston . 5 Urinary-Tract Infections These are actually very common in young children , particularly girls . The reason : " Their urethra is very short , providing bacteria from the bowel easy access to the bladder , " says Dr. Johnston . There 's also evidence that uncircumcised boys are at increased risk of infection because of the way urine flows beneath the foreskin . In most cases , a urinary-tract infection will cause a fever , lower abdominal pain , and painful urination . A toddler may clutch her stomach and grimace or cry when she urinates . You might also notice an unpleasant odor or blood in her urine . Either way , UTIs should be treated with antibiotics , so see the pediatrician as soon as you suspect your child has one . He 'll probably take her blood pressure ( it often rises in kids with UTIs ) and get a urine sample to confirm that an infection is present . In the meantime , apply a hot-water bottle wrapped in a towel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaps that could irritate her genitals . Finally , make sure she drinks lots of water to flush bacteria from the bladder . Some studies suggest that cranberry juice is especially effective against UTIs ; it contains substances that prevent bacteria from sticking to the bladder . 6 Croup The cough starts just after midnight . The sound is so horrible and distinctive , like the bark of a seal , that most pediatricians can diagnose the problem over the phone as croup-an inflammation of the larynx and trachea . Doctors do n't know why , but croup affects twice as many boys as girls ; children between 6 months and 3 years of age are most susceptible because their windpipe is small , making breathing difficult if it swells up . Croup often follows a viral infection ( such as a cold ) , so antibiotics are rarely helpful . Attacks usually subside when a child breathes in very cold or very hot air , which helps " shock " swollen airways into shrinking long enough to bring relief . Try taking him out in the cool night air or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a hot shower and have him breathe in the steam . " You also might want to sing to him or play soft music , " says Dr. Johnston . " The more relaxed he is , the easier it will be for him to breathe . " If his breathing stays noisy and labored , call 911 or take him to the ER ; he may need steroids or a bronchodilator . You should also get emergency help if he has trouble catching his breath or if he gasps or makes a whistling sound whenever he inhales . 7 Bronchiolitis A few days into her cold , your baby suddenly starts to wheeze and gasp for air . The muscles between her rib cage and collarbone cave in every time she takes a breath . The possible cause : bronchiolitis , an infection of the smallest breathing tubes of the lungs . " It 's usually caused by the respiratory syncytial virus , " says Dr. Powers . " An RSV infection causes the breathing passages to swell up , and this can block air from flowing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between October and March . Although RSV often causes nothing more than a cold , it 's more likely to trigger bronchiolitis in babies under 6 months because their airways are smaller . It can also be life-threatening : One study found that 16 percent of children under 1 who were hospitalized were admitted because of complications from bronchiolitis . Children at high risk may be given a monthly injection of palivizumab as a preventive . If you suspect your baby or toddler has bronchiolitis , let your pediatrician know right away . In mild cases , there 's little you can do except ease her stuffy nose with a humidifier , a bulb syringe , and saltwater nose drops . " Babies may also have a harder time feeding , so watch for signs of dehydration , " says Dr. Powers . In severe cases , your child may need bronchodilating drugs to open up her airways or emergency oxygen at the hospital . Some babies may be treated with RSV  --  specific antibodies , a controversial therapy that 's used only with infants who are seriously ill. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blisters all over his palms , the soles of his feet , and inside his mouth . No need to panic : He probably has hand-footand-mouth disease . HFMD is a common viral infection among toddlers , especially during the summer and fall . It 's also highly contagious but is usually mild and lasts only a few days . In isolated cases , however , HFMD has led to complications , such as encephalitis ( inflammation of the brain ) and meningitis , so call the pediatrician if you think your child has it . Do n't be surprised if the doctor recommends nothing more than rest and acetaminophen to reduce the fever . " There 's really no other treatment , " says Dr. Shook , " but you can offer your child plenty of water and soft , bland foods-such as custard , Jell-O , and ice cream-that wo n't irritate the sores in his mouth . " And watch out for dehydration , particularly in babies , who may find nursing painful . To keep the virus from spreading to other family members , wash your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishwasher on the hotwater cycle or have him use disposable ones until his infection clears up . Wash your hands regularly and throw away or clean toys that your child may have put in his mouth . The good news : Battling all these viruses and bacteria can help build up your child 's resistance to these bugs . So the more he 's exposed to them as a baby or toddler , the easier it will be for him to shake them off when he 's older , and the happier and healthier he 'll be .
