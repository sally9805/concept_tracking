" Most parents reside on pedestals , and if Dad 's had been a little higher than the norm , he had that much farther to fall . " So writes Tina Sinatra ( with Jeff Coplon ) in My Father 's Daughter ( Simon &; Schuster ; 313 pages ; $26 ) , her affectionate but clear-eyed memoir about life with Frank . The thought continues : " I could accept him as just a man . But he 'd stood so large in my eyes that I could n't bear to see him smaller than life . " <P> Yeah , me neither , says the reader , presumably a Frank Sinatra fan , elsewise he or she would be reading Margaret Salinger 's book . Unlike Salinger , Tina is n't out to keelhaul her father , at least not consciously . " He was a man who all his life looked outside for what was missing inside , " she concludes at one point . Still , you hate to see the Chairman of the Board reduced to the level of a case study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its epic retelling of his long descent into dementia or its ax-grinding with the singer 's fourth wife , Barbara Marx , but for its thoughtful , sometimes moving recollections of growing up as Beverly Hills-Palm Springs royalty with an intermittently available father whose flaws cast very long shadows . Though there 's little about music here , another of Ms. Sinatra 's observations puts Frank 's shortcomings into proper perspective : " Had he been a healthier , less tortured man , he might have been Perry Como . " Of course you ca n't balance a childhood against , say , All the Way , except to say , her loss , our gain . <P>  --  By Bruce Handy
