In homes across America , parents are tossing summer-camp applications into trash cans . " Last year I spent $2,000 to send my 6-year-old to day camp , and she could n't bring a Popsicle into the pool area , " says Pauline Izrailov of West Bloomfield , Mich . " This year I got a backyard wading pool for $11.95 . My kids can splash in it , pee in it , eat cheeseburgers in it . They 'll love it ! " <P> After decades of herding kids to camp , some families are reconsidering it this year . The recession is a factor , as is the desire since Sept. 11 to keep kids near home . But there 's also an urge to return to the unstructured days of yore , when a child 's summer was shared lazily with neighborhood pals . <P> Last fall the nation 's 12,000 camps worried that enrollments would plummet , as parents vowed to keep kids home . Trying to ease the panic by calling camps a " safe haven , " the industry now hopes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> There are pockets of resistance , however . One is the Heather Hill subdivision in Randolph , N.J. , where my sister and brother-in-law are rearing three kids .

Each day this summer most Heather Hill kids will take just a few hours of community recreational programs . That will leave plenty of time for the neighborhood 's traditional yard-to-yard water-gun battles . <P> Heather Hill parents see a psychological upside to skipping camp . Last year Rachel Ellentuck spent $10,000 to send two daughters , 8 and 11 , to overnight camp , where they endured pinkeye , athlete 's foot and bouts of loneliness . This summer they 'll stay home . " They have a lot on their little shoulders during the school year , " she says . " They need downtime . " <P> Certainly , for working parents , keeping kids home gets complicated . Educators warn that even a simple summer needs a schedule , or kids end up at Camp Couch Potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to have trouble finding jobs this summer , so they 'll be available to baby-sit . It also helps to befriend at-home moms who will take your kids along when driving theirs to activities . Just find ways to repay the favor . <P> As a parent sending three daughters to camp , I 'm envious of Heather Hill 's commitment to a laid-back summer . " At camp , your day is planned for you , " says Fortunata Kusik . " My kids have to learn to entertain themselves . " <P> Camps in rural areas say they are safer for kids today . But Heather Hill parents do n't buy it . " Safer ? " snaps my brother-in-law . " ' Rural area ' is a euphemism for a meadow filled with poison ivy and snakes . " He likes the idea of all those Tom Sawyers and Becky Thatchers running from yard to yard this summer . <P> " Especially , " he says , " because the price is right .
