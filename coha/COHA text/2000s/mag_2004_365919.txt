THE BIN LADEN NAME HAS BECOME INFAMOUS , BUT ONE FAMILY MEMBER IS trying to give it a different odor . Osama 's older half brother ( they share the same father ) has just put his name on a new perfume , a jasmine-heavy scent dubbed Yeslam . Bin Ladin ( his spelling ) , a resident of Geneva who has dual Swiss-Saudi citizenship , spoke with TIME 's Scott MacLeod in Paris . <P> ARE N'T PEOPLE GOING TO SAY , " COME ON , A PERFUME FROM OSAMA 'S BROTHER " ? I 'm not only a bin Laden . I am Yeslam bin Ladin . I have my own identity . It is my perfume , my creation . I was about to do it several years ago , but then I had to stop because of the events of Sept. 11 . I expect people out of curiosity will try it , and they will find the smell out of this world . <P> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT OSAMA 'S LATEST VIDEOTAPE ? It was upsetting . It 's the violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive . I always thought that if he was killed , everybody would know it . It seems that he might have seen the Michael Moore movie Fahrenheit 9/11 . <P> WHAT 'S IT LIKE BEING A BIN LADEN AFTER 9/11 ? Very difficult . I had to defend myself . The Attorney General of Switzerland decided to come one day uninvited . He took away cartons and cartons of documents . I understand that after Sept. 11 there was lots of suspicion and that everybody wanted to check everything . The investigation has finished , the file has been closed , and nothing was ever found . <P> IS IT HARD TO MAKE PLANE OR RESTAURANT RESERVATIONS ? Luckily , when you go out in public , nobody knows who you are . You walk the street like everybody . I 've heard comments when I make reservations . If I am going to have lunch with somebody , the reservations would be in his name . <P> IS OSAMA STILL CONSIDERED PART OF THE FAMILY ? I think every person is responsible for his acts . If somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help him or stand by him . The family will not be responsible for the acts of one of its members . <P> WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP ? He was more religious than the rest of us . He was one of the very few who did not leave Saudi Arabia to study . I do n't know him very well . I think I saw him before he left for Afghanistan in the 1980s , and I have n't seen him since . The only memory is that he did n't want music on in the house . He wanted it off . It was n't " ethical . " I thought that was weird . <P> ANY BROTHERLY FEELINGS ? It has become a name in a newspaper . The story has become ink on paper . <P> WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL MOORE 'S COMPLAINT  --  THAT LOTS OF BIN LADENS FLED THE U.S. AFTER 9/11 WITHOUT BEING QUESTIONED PROPERLY BY THE FBI ? They did not feel welcome anymore in the U.S. at that time . I want you to put yourself in their shoes . Many senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to 9/11 . Those authorities knew everything about the family before . I have been interviewed by the U.S. authorities . <P> DO ANY BIN LADENS STILL SUPPORT OR SYMPATHIZE WITH OSAMA ? I do n't think so . What he has done hurts the family . Financially , if somebody wants to work with you , they think twice . I have been investigated for the past three years because of that . Should ever anybody help him , that person will be responsible for his actions . <P> WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THE 9/11 ATTACKS ? Innocent life is sacred . I was shocked . My mother that evening fell ill with the news .
